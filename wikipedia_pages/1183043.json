    "text": " is a 1980 &lt;a href=\"jidaigeki\"&gt;jidaigeki&lt;/a&gt; film directed by &lt;a href=\"Akira%20Kurosawa\"&gt;Akira Kurosawa&lt;/a&gt;. \"Kagemusha\" is the Japanese term for a &lt;a href=\"political%20decoy\"&gt;political decoy&lt;/a&gt;, literally meaning \"shadow warrior\". It is set in the &lt;a href=\"Sengoku%20period\"&gt;Sengoku period&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20history\"&gt;Japanese history&lt;/a&gt; and tells the story of a lower-class criminal who is taught to impersonate a dying \"&lt;a href=\"daimy%C5%8D\"&gt;daimy\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" to dissuade opposing lords from attacking the newly vulnerable clan. The \"daimy\u014d\" is based on &lt;a href=\"Takeda%20Shingen\"&gt;Takeda Shingen&lt;/a&gt;, and the film ends with the climactic 1575 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nagashino\"&gt;Battle of Nagashino&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe film won the &lt;a href=\"Palme%20d%27Or\"&gt;Palme d'Or&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;1980 Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (tied with \"&lt;a href=\"All%20That%20Jazz%20%28film%29\"&gt;All That Jazz&lt;/a&gt;\"). It was also nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film&lt;/a&gt; and received other honours. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of \"The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time\" by Japanese film magazine &lt;a href=\"Kinema%20Junpo\"&gt;Kinema Junpo&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nIn Japan's &lt;a href=\"Sengoku%20period\"&gt;Sengoku period&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Takeda%20Shingen\"&gt;Takeda Shingen&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"daimy%C5%8D\"&gt;daimy\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"Takeda%20clan\"&gt;Takeda clan&lt;/a&gt;, meets with his brother &lt;a href=\"Takeda%20Nobukado\"&gt;Nobukado&lt;/a&gt;, and an unnamed thief whom the latter met by chance and spared from &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion%23Japan\"&gt;crucifixion&lt;/a&gt; due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers then agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a \"kagemusha\", a political decoy. Later, Shingen's army has besieged a castle of &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20Ieyasu\"&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu&lt;/a&gt;. One evening when Shingen visits the battlefield he is shot by a sniper who has mapped Shingen's previous movements in the camp. Mortally wounded, he orders a withdrawal and commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Shingen soon dies with only a small group of witnesses. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals &lt;a href=\"Oda%20Nobunaga\"&gt;Oda Nobunaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20Ieyasu\"&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uesugi%20Kenshin\"&gt;Uesugi Kenshin&lt;/a&gt; each contemplate the consequences of Shingen's withdrawal of his army still not knowing of his death.\nNobukado presents the thief to &lt;a href=\"Twenty-Four%20Generals%20of%20Takeda%20Shingen\"&gt;Shingen's generals&lt;/a&gt;, proposing to have this \"kagemusha\" impersonate Shingen full-time. At first, even the thief is unaware of Shingen's death, until he tries to break into a huge jar, believing it to contain treasure, and instead finds Shingen's preserved corpse. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and set him free. Later, the Takeda leaders secretly drop the jar with Shingen's corpse into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Suwa\"&gt;Lake Suwa&lt;/a&gt;. Spies working for Tokugawa and his ally Oda witness the disposal of the jar and, suspecting that Shingen has died, go to report the death. The thief, however, overhearing the spies, goes to offer his services, hoping to be of some use to Shingen in death. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were making an offering of &lt;a href=\"sake\"&gt;sake&lt;/a&gt; to the god of the lake. The spies follow the Takeda army as they march home from the siege. Although they suspect that Shingen has died, they are later convinced by the \"kagemusha\"'s performance.\nReturning home, the \"kagemusha\" successfully fools Shingen's &lt;a href=\"retinue\"&gt;retinue&lt;/a&gt;. By imitating Shingen's gestures and learning more about him, the \"kagemusha\" begins to uncannily mimic the persona of Shingen, and even convinces &lt;a href=\"Takeda%20Katsuyori\"&gt;Takeda Katsuyori&lt;/a&gt;'s son and Shingen's grandson, who was very close with Shingen. When the \"kagemusha\" must preside over a clan council to plan how to respond to provocative attacks made by Tokugawa against Takeda border castles, he is instructed by Nobukado to not speak until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the \"kagemusha\" will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Katsuyori is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the \"kagemusha\" in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are not aware that Shingen is dead. Katsuyori directly asks the \"kagemusha\" what course of action the \"lord thinks\" should be taken. After a long pause, the \"kagemusha\" replies, \"A mountain does not move,\" convincingly in Shingen's own manner. The \"kagemusha\"s effective improvisation further impresses the generals.\nSoon, in 1573, Oda Nobunaga is mobilizing his forces to attack &lt;a href=\"Azai%20Nagamasa\"&gt;Azai Nagamasa&lt;/a&gt;, continuing his campaign in central &lt;a href=\"Honshu\"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; to maintain his control of &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt; against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda clans launch an attack on Takeda territory, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of other generals. The \"kagemusha\" is forced to lead reinforcements to the 1574 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Takatenjin\"&gt;Battle of Takatenjin&lt;/a&gt;, and helps inspire the troops to victory. In a fit of overconfidence, the \"kagemusha\" attempts to ride Shingen's spirited horse. When he falls off, those who rush to help him see that he does not have their lord's battle scars, and he is revealed as an impostor. The thief is driven out of the palace in disgrace, and Katsuyori takes over the clan. Oda and Tokugawa, sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.\nNow in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads the counter-offensive against Nobunaga, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nagashino\"&gt;Battle of Nagashino&lt;/a&gt;. Although courageous in their assault, wave after wave of attacking Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of &lt;a href=\"Tanegashima%20%28gun%29\"&gt;\"tanegashima\"&lt;/a&gt; fire from Oda troops deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The exiled \"kagemusha\", who has followed the Takeda army, is dismayed and in a final show of loyalty, he takes up a spear and makes a hopeless charge against the Oda lines. Mortally wounded, the \"kagemusha\" attempts futilely to retrieve the \"&lt;a href=\"f%C5%ABrinkazan\"&gt;f\u016brinkazan&lt;/a&gt;\" banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water. His body floats past it as the film concludes with a long shot of the abandoned \"f\u016brinkazan\".\nProduction.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20Lucas\"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Ford%20Coppola\"&gt;Francis Ford Coppola&lt;/a&gt; are credited at the end of the film as &lt;a href=\"executive%20producer\"&gt;executive producer&lt;/a&gt;s in the international version. This is because they persuaded &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, &lt;a href=\"Toho%20Studios\"&gt;Toho Studios&lt;/a&gt;, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film.\nKurosawa originally cast the actor &lt;a href=\"Shintaro%20Katsu\"&gt;Shintaro Katsu&lt;/a&gt; in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the &lt;a href=\"Criterion%20Collection\"&gt;Criterion Collection&lt;/a&gt; DVD, executive producer &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Ford%20Coppola\"&gt;Coppola&lt;/a&gt; states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Tatsuya%20Nakadai\"&gt;Tatsuya Nakadai&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the \"kagemusha\" and the lord whom he impersonated.\nKurosawa wrote a part in \"Kagemusha\" for his longtime regular actor &lt;a href=\"Takashi%20Shimura\"&gt;Takashi Shimura&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Kagemusha\" was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The &lt;a href=\"Criterion%20Collection\"&gt;Criterion Collection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film.\nAccording to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many beautiful special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the \"&lt;a href=\"cutting-room%20floor\"&gt;cutting-room floor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRelease.\n\"Kagemusha\" was released theatrically in Japan on April 26, 1980, where it was distributed by &lt;a href=\"Toho\"&gt;Toho&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in the United States theatrically in October 6, 1980, where it was distributed by &lt;a href=\"Twentieth%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;Twentieth Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;. The theatrical version in the United States had a 162-minute running time. It was released on home video in the United States with a 180-minute running time in 2005.\nBox office.\n\"Kagemusha\" was the number one Japanese film on the domestic market in 1980, earning in &lt;a href=\"Theatrical%20rental\"&gt;distribution rental&lt;/a&gt; income. The film grossed a total of () in Japanese &lt;a href=\"box%20office\"&gt;box office&lt;/a&gt; gross receipts.\nOverseas, the film grossed in the United States. In France, where it released on 1 October 1980, the film sold 904,627 tickets, equivalent to an estimated &lt;a href=\"gross%20revenue\"&gt;gross revenue&lt;/a&gt; of approximately (). This brings the film's total estimated worldwide gross to approximately .\nAccolades.\n\"Kagemusha\" won numerous honours in Japan and abroad, marking the beginning of Kurosawa's most successful decade in international awards, the 1980s. At the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;1980 Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, \"Kagemusha\" shared the &lt;a href=\"Palme%20d%27Or\"&gt;Palme d'Or&lt;/a&gt; with \"&lt;a href=\"All%20That%20Jazz%20%28film%29\"&gt;All That Jazz&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Kagemusha\" was nominated for two &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;: (&lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Production%20Design\"&gt;Best Art Direction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Yoshir%C5%8D%20Muraki\"&gt;Yoshir\u014d Muraki&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film\"&gt;Best Foreign Language Film&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 2016, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollywood%20Reporter\"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the film 10th among 69 counted winners of the \"&lt;a href=\"Palme%20d%27Or\"&gt;Palme d'Or&lt;/a&gt;\" to date, concluding \"Set against the wars of\u00a016th-century\u00a0Japan,\u00a0Kurosawa\u2019s\u00a0majestic samurai epic is still awe-inspiring, not only in its historical pageantry, but for imagery that communicates complex ideas about reality, belief and meaning.\""
