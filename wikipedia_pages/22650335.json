    "text": "The 1878\u201379 Home Nations rugby union matches are a series of international friendlies held between the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; national &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; teams. The only recognised competition held between the countries was the inaugural &lt;a href=\"Calcutta%20Cup\"&gt;Calcutta Cup&lt;/a&gt; match, contested between England and Scotland. It was the first challenge for the Cup, and ended in an unspectacular draw.\nResults.\nScoring system.\nThe matches for this season were decided on goals scored. A goal was awarded for a successful conversion after a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;, for a dropped goal or for a &lt;a href=\"goal%20from%20mark\"&gt;goal from mark&lt;/a&gt;. If a game was drawn, any unconverted tries were tallied to give a winner. If there was still no clear winner, the match was declared a draw."
