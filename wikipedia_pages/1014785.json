    "text": "The Bolivia national football team (), also known as \"La Verde\", has represented &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; in international &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; since 1926. Organized by the &lt;a href=\"Bolivian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Bolivian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FBF), it is one of the 10 members of &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;'s South American Football Confederation (&lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt;).\nAfter playing in the &lt;a href=\"1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1950&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cups&lt;/a&gt;, they have qualified just once, in &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, where they were eliminated in the group stage. Bolivia have never advanced past the first round of any World Cup, and have only scored one goal, in 1994. Despite their World Cup performances, Bolivia won the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; at home in &lt;a href=\"1963%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;, and finished runners-up in &lt;a href=\"1997%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, which they also hosted. At the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; in Chile, they advanced to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1997, after defeating &lt;a href=\"Ecuador%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132. This also ended a winless streak in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, with their last win being on 28 June 1997, when they defeated &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the semi-finals.\nHistory.\nBolivia debuted in international football in 1926, one year after the &lt;a href=\"Bolivian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Bolivian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; was founded, and joined FIFA that same year. As participants at the &lt;a href=\"1926%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1926 South American Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, Bolivia played their first match against &lt;a href=\"Chile%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;the hosts&lt;/a&gt; on 12 October 1926, and even ended up scoring first against them, but wound up being defeated by the Chileans 7\u20131. Bolivia also lost their following three matches: 0\u20135 against &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, 1\u20136 against &lt;a href=\"Paraguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; and 0\u20136 against &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1930, Bolivia was one of the teams invited to the inaugural edition of the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, held in &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;. Drawn in &lt;a href=\"1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%202\"&gt;Group 2&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1930 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Bolivia lost both its games 4\u20130, first to &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Parque%20Central\"&gt;Estadio Parque Central&lt;/a&gt;, and then to &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Centenario\"&gt;Estadio Centenario&lt;/a&gt;. The match versus the Yugoslavs would be the last match against non-South American opposition for Bolivia until 1972\u00a0\u2013 when they again met Yugoslavia. They returned for the &lt;a href=\"1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1950 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where Argentina's withdrawal from the qualifiers gave Bolivia an automatic berth. With three teams declining to play in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, Bolivia was put in a group of two along with Uruguay. The Bolivians' only game was an 8\u20130 defeat to Uruguay at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20Independ%C3%AAncia\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio Independ\u00eancia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Belo%20Horizonte\"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt;.\nBolivia's greatest football achievement was the &lt;a href=\"1963%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1963 South American Championship&lt;/a&gt; title, which they hosted and won after placing first out of 7 countries, including being undefeated, with five wins and one draw. The only draw for Bolivia in the tournament was a 4\u20134 draw against Ecuador in the opening match. They also had the advantage of being better accustomed to &lt;a href=\"Effects%20of%20high%20altitude%20on%20humans\"&gt;higher altitudes&lt;/a&gt;. In the following edition, the &lt;a href=\"1967%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1967 South American Championship&lt;/a&gt;, held in Uruguay, Bolivia finished last out of six teams, with one draw and four losses, which was far below what the public expected, as Bolivia had been the defending champion. \nAfterwards, the country only started to resurge at an international level with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"w%3Aes%3AAcademia%20Tahuichi%20Aguilera\"&gt;Academia Tahuichi Aguilera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra\"&gt;Santa Cruz de la Sierra&lt;/a&gt; in 1978, a football school that developed players such as &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Etcheverry\"&gt;Marco Etcheverry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Erwin S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Cristaldo\"&gt;Luis Cristaldo&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder Spanish coach &lt;a href=\"Xabier%20Azkargorta\"&gt;Xabier Azkargorta&lt;/a&gt; and featuring nine players from Tahuichi, Bolivia surprisingly became the first team to beat Brazil in the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CONMEBOL%29\"&gt;1994 World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; while playing them in &lt;a href=\"La%20Paz\"&gt;La Paz&lt;/a&gt;, with a 2\u20130 win, and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; by finishing second in Group B behind the Brazilians themselves, which included record 7\u20130 and 7\u20131 wins over Venezuela during their qualification campaign. \nBolivia was drawn into the tournament's &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20C\"&gt;Group C&lt;/a&gt;, and played defending champions &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament's opening match at &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Field\"&gt;Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia played a great first half, outplaying Germany. In the second half, &lt;a href=\"Lothar%20Matth%C3%A4us\"&gt;Lothar Matth\u00e4us&lt;/a&gt; took a 40-yard run and struck Marco \"El Diablo\" Etcheverry with a high elbow to his jaw. Etcheverry retaliated by fouling Matthaus and was sent off. Eventually, Bolivia lost on a controversial offside goal by &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann\"&gt;Jurgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt;. Following a goalless draw with &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Foxboro%20Stadium\"&gt;Foxboro Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, where Bolivia was forced to play with 10 men again after Cristaldo's red card, Bolivia returned to Chicago and lost 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Spain%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, with S\u00e1nchez scoring the first ever Bolivian goal in a World Cup. \nFollowing the World Cup, Bolivia participated in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; held in Uruguay, with &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Lopez%20Habas\"&gt;Antonio Lopez Habas&lt;/a&gt; as manager, where they made the quarter-finals for the first time since winning the competition in 1963, with one win, one draw, and one loss. In the quarter-finals, the nation lost to hosts Uruguay 2\u20131. Despite the decent performance the team displayed during the tournament, Lopez Habas left his post shortly before the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;1997 Copa America&lt;/a&gt;, being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Du%C5%A1an%20Dra%C5%A1kovi%C4%87\"&gt;Du\u0161an Dra\u0161kovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. The 1997 edition was the second time Bolivia held the tournament. The team reached the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;, as had happened last time Bolivia was the host, but this time they finished runner-up to reigning world champion Brazil after losing 3\u20131 in &lt;a href=\"1997%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith their runner-up finish at the previous Copa America, Bolivia made their first and only &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; appearance in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;1999 edition&lt;/a&gt;, this time under new Argentine manager &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9ctor%20Veira\"&gt;H\u00e9ctor Veira&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia was placed in group A along with hosts &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. Their campaign started with a 2\u20132 draw against Egypt. Their next match was a 0\u20130 draw against Saudi Arabia. For their last match in the group, they had to play hosts Mexico, in which Bolivia lost 0\u20131 with a goal from &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Palencia\"&gt;Francisco Palencia&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia finished third in the group with two draws and a loss, being eliminated from the tournament in the first stage.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, under Bolivian manager &lt;a href=\"Mauricio%20Soria\"&gt;Mauricio Soria&lt;/a&gt;, Bolivia were placed in &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Group%20A\"&gt;Group A&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Chile%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico, and &lt;a href=\"Ecuador%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. In their match against Mexico, Bolivia drew 0\u20130. However, against Ecuador, Bolivia won 3\u20132, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Raldes\"&gt;Raldes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Smedberg-Dalence\"&gt;Smedberg-Dalence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Martins%20Moreno\"&gt;Moreno&lt;/a&gt;. From this victory against Ecuador, Bolivia made it to the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;next round&lt;/a&gt;, the quarter-finals, for the first time since the 1997 tournament, which they hosted. Bolivia were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Peru%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20133 in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20knockout%20stage%23Bolivia%20vs%20Peru\"&gt;quarter-finals&lt;/a&gt; of the tournament, and Bolivia's only goal of the game was a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; in the last minutes of the match scored by Marcelo Moreno.\nStadium.\nBolivia plays their home matches at &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Hernando%20Siles\"&gt;Estadio Hernando Siles&lt;/a&gt;, which has an altitude of above sea level, making it one of the highest football stadiums in the world. Many visiting teams have protested that the altitude gives Bolivia an unfair advantage against opponents. On 27 May 2007, &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; declared that no World Cup Qualifying matches could be played in stadiums above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. However, FIFA raised the altitude limit to 3,000 meters a month later after negative feedback against the ban, and included a special exception for La Paz, thus allowing the stadium to continue holding World Cup qualifying matches. A year after the original ban, in May 2008, FIFA removed the altitude limit entirely.\nTeam image.\nKit history.\nBolivia's first uniforms were all white. In the 1930 FIFA World Cup, before the match with Yugoslavia, Bolivia painted one of the letters in \"Viva Uruguay\" in each of the eleven starters' jerseys to please the local crowd. In the following game with Brazil, given the adversary also wore white, Bolivia instead borrowed Uruguay's own blue uniform to play. Bolivia again painted a message to the hosts in the &lt;a href=\"1945%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1945 South American Championship&lt;/a&gt;, with the players' jerseys reading \"Viva Chile\". In 1946, Bolivia changed their jersey colors to black and white stripes, like the colors of the &lt;a href=\"Cochabamba\"&gt;Cochabamba&lt;/a&gt; region. FBF reverted to white the following year. In 1957, FBF decided to use one of the colors in the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Bolivia\"&gt;Flag of Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. Given red and yellow were used by many of the other South Americans, green became the primary color, leading to the nickname \"La Verde\" (\"The Green\").\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following 33 players were called up for the friendly match against &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt; on 21 January 2022 and the &lt;a href=\"2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CONMEBOL%29\"&gt;2022 FIFA World Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt; matches against &lt;a href=\"Venezuela%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chile%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; on 28 January and 1 February 2022, respectively.\n\"Caps and goals updated , after the game against &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have been called up during the last twelve months.
