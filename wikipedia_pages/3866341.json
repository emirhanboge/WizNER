    "text": "Old Castle Swifts Football Club, the first professional &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club in &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, was formed by &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; shipowner &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Currie\"&gt;Donald Currie&lt;/a&gt; in September 1892 as Castle Swifts Football Club. The club's first home ground, located in &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham\"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt;, was named Dunottar Park, after the Castle Line company's ship &lt;a href=\"RMS%20Dunottar%20Castle\"&gt;\"Dunottar Castle\"&lt;/a&gt;. In 1894, Old Castle Swifts merged with Old St Luke's and was renamed. The club was wound up the following season. Its demise saw several players join the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.\"&gt;Thames Ironworks&lt;/a&gt;, the club that was later reformed as &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nOld Castle Swifts Football Club was formed by Scottish shipowner Donald Currie in September 1892 as Castle Swifts Football Club. They were the &lt;a href=\"works%20team\"&gt;works team&lt;/a&gt; of the ship repair yard of The &lt;a href=\"Union-Castle%20Line\"&gt;Castle Shipping Line&lt;/a&gt; and initially the majority of the team were drawn from the mainly Scottish workforce, paid for the games they played.\nCastles Swifts' first home ground, a field located opposite the &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham\"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt; Police Station in West Ham Lane, was called \"Dunottar Park\", after the Castle Line's ship &lt;a href=\"RMS%20Dunottar%20Castle\"&gt;Dunottar Castle&lt;/a&gt;. The ground had perimeter fencing and admission was charged at 3&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20English%20penny\"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;.\n1892\u20131893.\nCastle Swifts did not remain long at Dunottar Park, having to find a new ground after a dispute with the landlord. One was soon located in fields beside Wakefield Street in &lt;a href=\"East%20Ham\"&gt;East Ham&lt;/a&gt;, known as Temple Meadows, which lay in the grounds of Temple House, not far from &lt;a href=\"East%20Ham%20tube%20station\"&gt;East Ham railway station&lt;/a&gt;. The team would change into their kit in the nearby Denmark Inn (now the &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20Arms\"&gt;Denmark Arms&lt;/a&gt;), located on the &lt;a href=\"Barking%20Road\"&gt;Barking Road&lt;/a&gt;. The Denmark Arms would later be used by many West Ham United fans before matches at the &lt;a href=\"Boleyn%20Ground\"&gt;Boleyn Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 1893 they faced &lt;a href=\"Barking%20F.C.\"&gt;Barking Woodville&lt;/a&gt; in the final of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20Charity%20Cup\"&gt;West Ham Charity Cup&lt;/a&gt;, held at &lt;a href=\"Clapton%20F.C.\"&gt;Clapton&lt;/a&gt;'s Spotted Dog ground. The Swifts were two goals down before coming back to win the tie 4\u20132, with the goals coming from outside-right Grundy, inside forwards Mitchell and Taylor and an own goal. A local newspaper made the following account of the final:\n1893\u20131894.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"1893%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1893\u201394&lt;/a&gt; season, the team merged with Old St Luke's, and the newly formed team was renamed as Old Castle Swifts, and used Old St Luke's ground in &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Road\"&gt;Hermit Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canning%20Town\"&gt;Canning Town&lt;/a&gt;. Hermit Road had been described as a 'cinder heap' and 'barren waste'. It was surrounded by a moat and had canvas sheeting for fencing.\n1894\u20131895.\nThe Swifts officially became a professional outfit in November 1894, a move made after one of their players, Cunningham, was denied a return to amateur status. The club resigned from the &lt;a href=\"London%20FA\"&gt;London FA&lt;/a&gt; as a result.\nTheir demise came at the end of March 1895 when the club became bankrupt. Following this, the club played one further game, a pre-arranged fixture against &lt;a href=\"St%20Luke%27s%20F.C.%20%28England%29\"&gt;St Luke's&lt;/a&gt; on 16 April, under the name of Old St Luke's.\nThames Ironworks.\n&lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Hills\"&gt;Arnold Hills&lt;/a&gt;, the Chairman of &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Co.%20Ltd\"&gt;Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co. Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, saw the opportunity to fund a works side, so provided the money, in order that he may take over the tenancy of the Hermit Road ground, and &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.\"&gt;Thames Ironworks&lt;/a&gt; was born. For the Ironworks' initial season of &lt;a href=\"1895%E2%80%9396%20Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1895\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Old Castle Swifts players were absorbed into the newly formed team. Among them were half-backs William Morton, Walter Parks and &lt;a href=\"John%20Thomas%20Archer%20Woods\"&gt;John Woods&lt;/a&gt;, forwards &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Lindsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201870%29\"&gt;Jamie Lindsay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Sage%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;George Sage&lt;/a&gt;, and full-back &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Stevenson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201869%29\"&gt;Robert Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;, who became the Ironworks' first ever captain. Goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"David%20Furnell\"&gt;David Furnell&lt;/a&gt; would also eventually join Thames Ironworks in 1897. The club later became &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;. The light blue shirts, white shorts and scarlet socks that were worn by Thames Ironworks from the &lt;a href=\"1897%E2%80%9398%20Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1897\u201398&lt;/a&gt; season, and also by the early West Ham United team, are thought to have originated with Old Castle Swifts."
