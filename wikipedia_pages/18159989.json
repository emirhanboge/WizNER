    "text": "Gustave Andr\u00e9 Bo\u00ebl (18 May 1837 \u2013 31 March 1912) was a &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; industrialist and &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; politician. He was the father of &lt;a href=\"Pol%20Clovis%20Bo%C3%ABl\"&gt;Pol Clovis Bo\u00ebl&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nBo\u00ebl was the son of farmers (Salasse farm), growing up with four brothers and a sister. Bo\u00ebl studied at the industrial school of Houdeng-Aimeries and in 1851, at the age of 14, started working at the \"Etablissements Ernest Boucqu\u00e9au\". He became foreman of the factory and in 1865 he became plant manager. Ernest Boucqu\u00e9au, at the edge of bankruptcy and faced with the refusal of his family to help him, asked Bo\u00ebl and his accountant to assist him in saving the company. They helped gather the necessary funds to finish the work he had started on the railroad tunnel between &lt;a href=\"Enghien\"&gt;Enghien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geraardsbergen\"&gt;Geraardsbergen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Braine-le-Comte\"&gt;Braine-le-Comte&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 16 July 1880 Ernest Boucqu\u00e9au died without leaving an heir and he bequeathed his fortune and his companies to Gustave Bo\u00ebl and his accountant. When the accountant died, Bo\u00ebl became the sole heir of the entire fortune and the factories. As of 1881, he modernized his companies and created an industrial group by taking participations in other companies, such as the steel factories \"Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi\" (Fafer) in &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; and in Braine-le-Comte, coal mines and &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; industry \"les Glaces de Moustier-sur-Sambre\" which would become &lt;a href=\"Glaverbel\"&gt;Glaverbel&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 September 1888, Gustave Bo\u00ebl was one of the first in Belgium who established a participation in the profits for the employees of his factory. In 1912, the \"Etablissements Ernest Boucqu\u00e9au\" would become the \"&lt;a href=\"Usines%20Gustave%20Bo%C3%ABl\"&gt;Usines Gustave Bo\u00ebl&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPolitical career.\nGustave Bo\u00ebl also inherited the liberal political and philosophical ideas of Boucqu\u00e9au. As a progressive liberal, he embarked on a political career. On 11 October 1880, Bo\u00ebl became a member of the communal council of &lt;a href=\"La%20Louvi%C3%A8re\"&gt;La Louvi\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, and on 14 November of the same year he became &lt;a href=\"alderman\"&gt;alderman&lt;/a&gt;. On 4 May 1881, Bo\u00ebl became &lt;a href=\"burgomaster\"&gt;burgomaster&lt;/a&gt; of La Louvi\u00e8re. During his mandate, he supported many local initiatives and provided financial support for the construction of the hospital of La Louvi\u00e8re. In 1883, he resigned as burgomaster and became senator from 12 April 1883 until 8 July 1884. Asked by his liberal political friends, he again became senator on 14 June 1892 and from that moment onwards, Bo\u00ebl would stay senator for the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; until his death in 1912."
