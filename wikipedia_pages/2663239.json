Its name means \"Labourers\" in &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; and stems from the relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20movement\"&gt;Labour movement&lt;/a&gt; which the club had during the first half of the 20th century.\nRadni\u010dki Ni\u0161 was one of the most stable clubs in the former &lt;a href=\"SFR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. The team spent a total of 29 seasons in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt;, achieved two 3rd-place finishes in &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1980%E2%80%9381%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;, and one 3rd-place finish in &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Serbian%20SuperLiga\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.

One of its founders was the communist activist Milo\u0161 Markovi\u0107 (who also founded &lt;a href=\"Sloboda%20U%C5%BEice\"&gt;Sloboda U\u017eice&lt;/a&gt; in 1925). In the same year, the club played its first unofficial matches. Two years later, in the 1925\u201326 season, the club became part of the professional league of the &lt;a href=\"Morava%20Banovina\"&gt;Morava Banovina&lt;/a&gt;, and won the championship on two occasions, in the 1924\u201325 and 1927\u201328 seasons. Following the proclamation of the royal dictatorship in 1929, the government began to persecute leftist activists, and Radni\u010dki changed its name to Gra\u0111anski. As Gra\u0111anski Ni\u0161, the club played in the &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20Yugoslav%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;1935\u201336 Yugoslav Football Championship&lt;/a&gt; which was played in a straight-knockout competition format, and was eliminated in the round of sixteen by &lt;a href=\"Gragjanski%20Skopje\"&gt;Gra\u0111anski Skoplje&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of that season the club reinstated its original name, and played until 1941, when, because of the war, the club ceased its activities and its members and players joined the resistance.\nAt the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in 1941, the club terminated the activities, which were renewed in 1945, one year after the liberation from the occupation of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rise and stabilization (1962\u20131975).\nIn &lt;a href=\"1962%E2%80%9363%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the club's history. On 23 September 1962, Radni\u010dki fans displayed their first big choreography on the first league match against &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. A large banner reading \"Real sa Ni\u0161ave\", which translates to \"&lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid\"&gt;Real&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nisava\"&gt;Nisava&lt;/a&gt;\" was raised on the east stand, and the club bears this nickname to this day. The banner could be seen at every home game throughout the 1960s. In following years, the club underwent major development and became one of the most stable football clubs in the country. In 1963, the club founded its youth school, through which many of the Radni\u010dki players passed. In 1975, Radni\u010dki beat Turkish club &lt;a href=\"Eski%C5%9Fehirspor\"&gt;Eski\u015fehirspor&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20130, 2\u20131) and won its first trophy of European importance, the &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Golden Era (1980\u20131984).\nIn &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;, Radni\u010dki finished the national championship in 3rd place, the best placement thus far, and played for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the following season, during which Radni\u010dki reached the round of sixteen, but lost against Dutch club &lt;a href=\"AZ%20Alkmaar\"&gt;AZ Alkmaar&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1980%E2%80%9381%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;, the club was again third and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1981\u201382 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; season. In the first round, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 were drawn against &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt;. In the first leg, the club from South Serbia achieved a 2\u20132 draw in front of 70.000 spectators at &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20San%20Paolo\"&gt;Stadio San Paolo&lt;/a&gt;, which was enough for Radni\u010dki to progress after a goalless match in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; because of the away goals rule. After eliminating \"the Azzurri\", Radni\u010dki played the second round against &lt;a href=\"Grasshopper%20Club%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt;. The Swiss club won the first match in Z\u00fcrich by 2\u20130, but Radni\u010dki had equalized with a 2\u20130 and won convincingly 3\u20130 in the penalty shoot-out. In the third round, the club played against &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord\"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt; from Rotterdam. In the first leg in &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, the result was 2\u20130 for Radni\u010dki and at \"De Kuip\" the result was 1\u20130 for the Dutch club. However, it was a 2\u20131 victory on aggregate for the Serbian club and in the quarter-finals Radni\u010dki were drawn against &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; from Scotland. In the first leg, played in Dundee, Radni\u010dki suffered a 2\u20130 defeat. Although they were not seen as the favourites in the return leg, the \"Real from Ni\u0161ava\" pulled off a convincing 3\u20130 win in front of its spectators, and with an aggregate score of 3\u20132 they eventually achieved their greatest success by reaching the semi-finals of this prestigious tournament. The semi-finals provided a football holiday at &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cair%20Stadium\"&gt;\u010cair Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, due to the fact that German top club &lt;a href=\"Hamburger%20SV\"&gt;Hamburger SV&lt;/a&gt;, led by stars like &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Hrubesch\"&gt;Horst Hrubesch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Magath\"&gt;Felix Magath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Bastrup\"&gt;Lars Bastrup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manfred%20Kaltz\"&gt;Manfred Kaltz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20von%20Heesen\"&gt;Thomas von Heesen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uli%20Stein\"&gt;Uli Stein&lt;/a&gt; would play in &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;. In the first leg, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 won against the favored North Germans in front of 38,500 enthusiastic Radni\u010dki fans with 2\u20131, but they lost the second leg in Hamburg by 5\u20131 (Hamburg lost at the end the final, but won next year the &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1982\u201383 European Cup&lt;/a&gt;). After one year of absence from international football, the club qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1983%E2%80%9384%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1983\u201384 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; season (finished the &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;1979\u201380 Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt; season in 4th place) and reached the round of sixteen, as in &lt;a href=\"1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;. After winning matches against &lt;a href=\"FC%20St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St Gallen&lt;/a&gt; (3\u20130, 2\u20131) and &lt;a href=\"FK%20Inter%20Bratislava\"&gt;FK Inter Bratislava&lt;/a&gt; (4\u20130, 2\u20133), Radni\u010dki played against &lt;a href=\"Hajduk%20Split\"&gt;Hajduk Split&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first intra-Yugoslav fixture in UEFA cup. Hajduk won both matches 2\u20130 and progressed to the quarter-finals.\nRadni\u010dki Ni\u0161 played a total of 22 matches across Europe between 1981 and 1984. During this time, Radni\u010dki lost only one &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; home match of a total of 11 across three seasons and only against a team from the domestic league. A major contribution was made by the fans and their enthusiastic support. The &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cair%20Stadium\"&gt;\u010cair Stadium&lt;/a&gt; was a tough ground for the opposition and the atmosphere created by Radni\u010dki fans in a roaring stadium always gave hope to the team that they could overcome anybody.\nLate Yugoslavia period/Serbia-Montenegro period (1985\u20132006).\nAfter the golden years, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 was unexpectedly relegated to in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Second%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav Second League&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, after 23 continuous years in the first league. However, under coach &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Duvan%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Josip Duvan\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, Radni\u010dki won the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Second%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav Second League&lt;/a&gt; in the following season and returned to the first league after only a year of absence. In 1989, the club played its second &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt; final after 1975, but they lost against &lt;a href=\"OFI%20Crete%20F.C.\"&gt;OFI Crete&lt;/a&gt; of Greece by 3\u20131. At the beginning of the 1990s, the entire country was plunged into a crisis. The disintegration of Yugoslavia, the civil war (1992\u201395), the inflation and the UN sanctions hit all the Yugoslav football teams hard, and also Radni\u010dki was no exception. In the 2000\u201301 season, the club dropped out of the first division for the second time in its history. In the following season, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 won the second division championship and quickly returned to the major clubs, but they ended the 2002\u201303 season in last place.

In the 2010\u201311 season, they won the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20League%20East\"&gt;Serbian League East&lt;/a&gt; and were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20First%20League\"&gt;Serbian First League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Serbia's second division&lt;/a&gt;. What followed was a consecutive promotion. The club won the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20Serbian%20First%20League\"&gt;2011-12 Serbian First League&lt;/a&gt; and was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20SuperLiga\"&gt;Serbian SuperLiga&lt;/a&gt;, Serbia's highest football tier.

Radni\u010dki was later eliminated in the second round by the favoured Israeli team &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20132 on aggregate. In the &lt;a href=\"2018-19%20Serbian%20SuperLiga\"&gt;SuperLiga&lt;/a&gt;, Radni\u010dki finished the season in second place behind defending champions &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, once again reaching the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Europa League.\nClub colors and crest.\nThe club performed in a green-white jersey and on the left, in the white field, was a red five-pointed star as a symbol of affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20movement\"&gt;Labour movement&lt;/a&gt;, the colour of which was later taken as a frequent kit color of Radni\u010dki. The club also used a blue and white kit, which was commonly seen during promotion play-offs and international fixtures, so the club bears all the colors of the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Serbian flag&lt;/a&gt;. The crest is in the colors red and white, and bears the inscription of the year of foundation and the image of the &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1%20Fortress\"&gt;Ni\u0161 Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, which is a complex and important cultural and historical monument of the city of &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;.\nKit evolution \n \nStadium.\nThe home ground of Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 is the &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cair%20Stadium\"&gt;\u010cair Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

After the renovation of the swimming pool, the \u010cair Sports Center, and the complete reconstruction of the \u010cair stadium, &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt; was endowed with a unique sports complex in Serbia and completed a full reconstruction of its sports infrastructure.\nReconstruction.\nThe \u010cair stadium began undergoing complete reconstruction during the second half of 2011 in an ambitious project by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Football Association of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;.

After reconstruction, the stadium fulfilled the most up to date &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; standards. The cost of the project was estimated to be over 1.1\u00a0billion Serbian &lt;a href=\"dinar\"&gt;dinar&lt;/a&gt;s (10\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s).\nDebut game at the new stadium.\nAlthough it had not been completely finished, &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cair%20Stadium\"&gt;\u010cair Stadium&lt;/a&gt; was declared as a suitable venue for the second home match (first home match had to be played at &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20FK%20Jagodina\"&gt;Jagodina City Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"FK%20Radni%C4%8Dki%201923\"&gt;Radni\u010dki Kragujevac&lt;/a&gt;).

In memory of the tragically lost star player, the football schools bears his name to this day.\nHistory.\nDuring 1963, one year after entry of Radni\u010dki in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt;, the club formed its own football schools at the initiative of Tihomir Petrovi\u0107. Forty-eight players were selected from nine primary schools and began to learn the football alphabet at Radni\u010dki. It was a bright start to the football school tradition of Radni\u010dki which would eventually become a real talent pool, producing many football names that would spread the word about Ni\u0161, Yugoslav and Serbian football. The first greater success came in 1966, when they won a large tournament in Germany. In 1969, this was followed by winning a tournament in Paris, defeating the Italian team US Cagliari. More success followed and one of the highlights was the win at the international tournament \"&lt;a href=\"FK%20Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star&lt;/a&gt;\", which was played in 1984 and which saw the participation of many national and international top youth teams. During the tournament, Radni\u010dki's youth was led by &lt;a href=\"Milorad%20Jankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milorad Jankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, a former player of Radni\u010dki, who was honoured as the top youth coach by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Football Association of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. 1991 will be remembered as the year when Radni\u010dki's youth achieved their greatest success. For the first time, led by coach Vladislav Nikoli\u0107, they won the Yugoslav championship, after defeating &lt;a href=\"FK%20%C5%BDeljezni%C4%8Dar%20Sarajevo\"&gt;\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20130 at home by a goal from &lt;a href=\"Dejan%20Petkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Dejan Petkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, 1\u20131). In 1992, Radni\u010dki again fielded a national championship team in their series. Its cadets were Yugoslav champions and repeated the success achieved the previous year, which was a triumph for the managers of the youth school and coaches like Miroslav Gli\u0161ovi\u0107, &lt;a href=\"Milorad%20Jankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milorad Jankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ljubi%C5%A1a%20Rajkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Ljubi\u0161a Rajkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and Miodrag Stefanovi\u0107. In that period, Radni\u010dki's football school was well known for its youth work, which demonstrated a high level of technical skill, especially recognizable in young players such as &lt;a href=\"Dragan%20Stojkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Dragan Stojkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dejan%20Petkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Dejan Petkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, as well as tactical readiness in combination with adaptability. The last major success of the Radni\u010dki's football school was in 2000, when Radni\u010dki's cadets, led by coach Aleksandar Jovanovski, won the Serbian championship. In the final, they beat &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; by 1\u20130 and qualified for the final tournament for the Yugoslav championship. In the contest for the best cadet teams in the country, Radni\u010dki's young players achieved the 3rd place. In the same year, new sport facilities were opened which facilitated better working conditions. Today, the youth coaches are mostly former players of Radni\u010dki who are responsible for 400\u2013450 young Radni\u010dki players and working according to the standards of major European football clubs.\nSupporters.\nThe first large organized support happened in 1962 against Vardar, when several thousand fans from &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt; travelled to &lt;a href=\"Skoplje\"&gt;Skoplje&lt;/a&gt;. In 1962, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in their history and attracted more supporters from Ni\u0161 and the surrounding region. Since Radni\u010dki's entry to the first division, &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cair%20Stadium\"&gt;\u010cair&lt;/a&gt; has always been a tough ground for the opposition. Although the club has had numerous supporters throughout the history, more organized groups emerged at the end of the 1980s. The name Meraklije was accepted, which roughly translates to \"bohemian hedonists\". The name has been synonymous with region customs for centuries.\nBesides the football club, Meraklije also support other sport sections like &lt;a href=\"Team%20handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20men%27s%20national%20handball%20team\"&gt;Serbian national handball team&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub honours and achievements.\nDomestic.\nNational Championships\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;a href=\"Serbian%20First%20League\"&gt;Serbian First League top scorers&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Serbian%20SuperLiga\"&gt;Serbian SuperLiga top scorers&lt;/a&gt;\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nRyosuke Nagasawa= JPN\nRetired number(s).\n &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Krsti%C4%87%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ivan \"Beli\" Krsti\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; (\u22122000)\u00a0\u2013 \"posthumous honour\".\nSince 2000, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 have not issued the squad number 10.
