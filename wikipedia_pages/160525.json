    "text": "Auguste-Maurice Barr\u00e8s (; 19 August 1862 \u2013 4 December 1923) was a French novelist, journalist and politician. Spending some time in Italy, he became a figure in &lt;a href=\"French%20literature\"&gt;French literature&lt;/a&gt; with the release of his work \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cult%20of%20the%20Self\"&gt;The Cult of the Self&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1888. In politics, he was first elected to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28France%29\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; in 1889 as a &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Boulanger\"&gt;Boulangist&lt;/a&gt; and would play a prominent political role for the rest of his life.\nBarr\u00e8s was associated in his literary works with &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Symbolism&lt;/a&gt;, a movement which had equivalence with British &lt;a href=\"Aestheticism\"&gt;Aestheticism&lt;/a&gt; and Italian &lt;a href=\"Decadent%20movement\"&gt;Decadentism&lt;/a&gt;; indeed he was a close associate of &lt;a href=\"Gabriele%20d%27Annunzio\"&gt;Gabriele d'Annunzio&lt;/a&gt; representing the latter. As the name of his trilogy suggests, his works glorified a humanistic love of the self and he also flirted with &lt;a href=\"occult\"&gt;occult&lt;/a&gt; mysticisms in his youth. The &lt;a href=\"Dreyfus%20affair\"&gt;Dreyfus affair&lt;/a&gt; saw an ideological shift from a liberal individualism rooted in the French Revolution to a more organic and traditional concept of the nation. He also became a leading anti-Dreyfusard popularising the term \"&lt;a href=\"French%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalisme&lt;/a&gt;\" to describe his views. He stood on a platform of \"Nationalism and Protectionism.\".\nPolitically, he became involved with various groups such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Ligue%20des%20Patriotes\"&gt;Ligue des Patriotes&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20D%C3%A9roul%C3%A8de\"&gt;Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de&lt;/a&gt;, which he became the leader of in 1914. Barr\u00e8s was close to &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of \"&lt;a href=\"Action%20Fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Action Fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt;\", a monarchist party. Despite the fact that he remained a &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt;, Barr\u00e8s would have a strong influence on various following French monarchists, as well as various other figures. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, he was a strong supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Sacr%C3%A9e\"&gt;Union Sacr\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; political truce. In later life, Barr\u00e8s returned to the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; faith and was involved in a campaign to restore French church buildings and helped establish 24 June as a national day of remembrance for St. &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBorn at &lt;a href=\"Charmes%2C%20Vosges\"&gt;Charmes, Vosges&lt;/a&gt;, he received his secondary education at the \"&lt;a href=\"lyc%C3%A9e\"&gt;lyc\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Nancy%2C%20France\"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;, attending there the lessons of &lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Burdeau\"&gt;Auguste Burdeau&lt;/a&gt;, later pictured as social climber Paul Bouteiller in \"Les D\u00e9racin\u00e9s\". In 1883 continued his legal studies in Paris. Establishing himself at first in the &lt;a href=\"Quartier%20Latin\"&gt;Quartier Latin&lt;/a&gt;, he became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Leconte%20de%20Lisle\"&gt;Leconte de Lisle&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"cenacle\"&gt;cenacle&lt;/a&gt; and with the &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;symbolist&lt;/a&gt;s in the 1880s, even meeting &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt; once. He had already started contributing to the monthly periodical, \"Jeune France\" (\"Young France\"), and he now issued a periodical of his own, \"Les Taches d'encre\", which survived for only a few months. After four years of journalism he settled in Italy, where he wrote \"Sous l'\u0153il des barbares\" (1888), the first volume of a \"trilogie du moi\" (also called \"Le Culte du moi\" or \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cult%20of%20the%20Self\"&gt;The Cult of the Self&lt;/a&gt;\"), completed by \"Un Homme libre\" (1889), and \"Le Jardin de B\u00e9r\u00e9nice\" (1891). \"The Cult of the Self\" trilogy was influenced by &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;, and also made an apology of the pleasure of the senses.\nHe supplemented these apologies for his narcissism with \"L'Ennemi des lois\" (1892), and with an admirable volume of impressions of travel, \"Du sang, de la volupt\u00e9, de la mort\" (1893). Barr\u00e8s wrote his early books in an elaborate and often very obscure style.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Com%C3%A9die%20Fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt; produced his play \"Une Journ\u00e9e parlementaire\" in 1894. A year after establishing himself in &lt;a href=\"Neuilly-sur-Seine\"&gt;Neuilly&lt;/a&gt;, he began his trilogy in 1897, \"Le Roman de l'\u00e9nergie nationale\" (\"Novel of the National Energy\"), with the publication of \"Les D\u00e9racin\u00e9s\". In this second major trilogy, he superated his early individualism with a patriotic fidelity to the fatherland and an &lt;a href=\"organicist\"&gt;organicist&lt;/a&gt; conception of the &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Barr%C3%A8s%23Barr%C3%A8s%27%20nationalism\"&gt;see below for details&lt;/a&gt;\"). Affected by the &lt;a href=\"Dreyfus%20Affair\"&gt;Dreyfus Affair&lt;/a&gt;, and finding himself on the side of the Anti-Dreyfusards, Barr\u00e8s played a leading role alongside &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, which initiated his shift to the political right; Barr\u00e8s oriented himself towards a lyrical form of nationalism, founded on the cult of the earth and the dead (\"la terre et les morts\", \"earth and the dead\" \u2014 \"&lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Barr%C3%A8s%23Political%20activism\"&gt;see below for details&lt;/a&gt;\").\nThe \"Roman de l'\u00e9nergie nationale\" trilogy makes a plea for local patriotism, &lt;a href=\"militarism\"&gt;militarism&lt;/a&gt;, the faith to one's roots and to one's family, and for the preservation of the distinctive qualities of the &lt;a href=\"provinces%20of%20France\"&gt;old French provinces&lt;/a&gt;. \"Les D\u00e9racin\u00e9s\" narrates the adventures of seven young &lt;a href=\"Lorraine%20%28province%29\"&gt;Lorrainers&lt;/a&gt; who set out to conquer fortune in Paris. Six of them survive in the second novel of the trilogy, \"L'Appel au soldat\" (1900), which gives the history of Boulangism; the sequel, \"Leurs figures\" (1902), deals with the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20scandal\"&gt;Panama scandal&lt;/a&gt;s. Later works include:\nHe presented himself in 1905 to the &lt;a href=\"Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt;, but was supplanted by &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Lamy\"&gt;Etienne Lamy&lt;/a&gt;. He then tried again, but inclined himself before the candidacy of the former Minister &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Ribot\"&gt;Alexandre Ribot&lt;/a&gt;. But he was finally elected the next year, gaining 25 voices against 8 to &lt;a href=\"Edmond%20Hauraucourt\"&gt;Edmond Hauraucourt&lt;/a&gt; and one to &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Aicart\"&gt;Jean Aicart&lt;/a&gt; on 25 January 1906.\nBarr\u00e8s was also a friend since his youth of the occultist &lt;a href=\"Stanislas%20de%20Guaita\"&gt;Stanislas de Guaita&lt;/a&gt;, and was attracted by Asia, &lt;a href=\"sufism\"&gt;sufism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;shi'ism&lt;/a&gt;. But he returned in his later years to the Catholic faith, engaging in \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Echo%20de%20Paris\"&gt;L'Echo de Paris&lt;/a&gt;\" a campaign in favour of the restoration of the churches of France. His son &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Barr%C3%A8s\"&gt;Philippe Barr\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; followed him in a journalism career.\nPolitical activism.\nAs a young man, Barr\u00e8s carried his Romantic and individualist theory of the Ego into politics as an ardent partisan of &lt;a href=\"George%20Ernest%20Jean%20Marie%20Boulanger\"&gt;General Boulanger&lt;/a&gt;, locating himself in the more &lt;a href=\"Populism\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt; side of the heterogenous Boulangist coalition. He directed a Boulangist paper at Nancy, and was elected deputy in 1889, at the age of 27, under a platform of \"Nationalism, Protectionism, and Socialism\", retaining his seat in the legislature until 1893, when he was defeated under the etiquette of \"National Republican and Socialist\" (\"R\u00e9publicain nationaliste et socialiste\"). From 1889, Barr\u00e8s' activism overshadowed his literary activities, although he tried to maintain both.\nHe shifted however to the right-wing during the &lt;a href=\"Dreyfus%20Affair\"&gt;Dreyfus Affair&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a leading mouthpiece, alongside &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, of the Anti-Dreyfusard side. The Socialist leader &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Blum\"&gt;L\u00e9on Blum&lt;/a&gt; tried to convince him to join the Dreyfusards, but Barr\u00e8s refused and wrote several anti-Semitic pamphlets. He wrote, \"That Dreyfus is guilty, I deduce not from the facts themselves, but from his race.\" Barr\u00e8s' anti-Jewishness found its roots both in the &lt;a href=\"scientific%20racism\"&gt;scientific racial&lt;/a&gt; contemporary theories and on &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20exegesis\"&gt;Biblical exegesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe founded the short-lived review \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Cocarde\"&gt;La Cocarde&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The &lt;a href=\"Cockade\"&gt;Cockade&lt;/a&gt;\") in 1894 (September 1894 \u2013 March 1895) to defend his ideas, attempting to bridge the gap between the far-left and the far-right. The \"Cocarde\", nationalist, &lt;a href=\"anti-parliamentarist\"&gt;anti-parliamentarist&lt;/a&gt; and anti-foreign, included a diverse collection of contributors from a wide variety of backgrounds (monarchists, socialists, &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20France\"&gt;anarchists&lt;/a&gt;, Jews, Protestants), including &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Amouretti\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Amouretti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Boylesve\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Boylesve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fernand%20Pelloutier\"&gt;Fernand Pelloutier&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was again beaten during the 1896 elections in Neuilly, as a candidate of the Socialist leader &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Jaur%C3%A8s\"&gt;Jean Jaur\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, and then again in 1897 as a nationalist anti-Semitic candidate, having broken with the left-wing during the Dreyfus Affair.\nBarr\u00e8s then assumed the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Ligue%20de%20la%20Patrie%20fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Ligue de la Patrie fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt; (League of the French Fatherland), before taking membership in the \"&lt;a href=\"Ligue%20des%20Patriotes\"&gt;Ligue des Patriotes&lt;/a&gt;\" (Patriot League) of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20D%C3%A9roul%C3%A8de\"&gt;Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de&lt;/a&gt;. In 1914, he became the leader of the Patriot League.\nClose to the nationalist writer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the monarchist &lt;a href=\"Action%20fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Action fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt; movement, Barr\u00e8s refused however to endorse monarchist ideas, although he demonstrated sympathy throughout his life for the Action fran\u00e7aise. Most of the later monarchist theorists (&lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Bainville\"&gt;Jacques Bainville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Vaugeois\"&gt;Henri Vaugeois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9on%20Daudet\"&gt;L\u00e9on Daudet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Massis\"&gt;Henri Massis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Maritain\"&gt;Jacques Maritain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bernanos\"&gt;Georges Bernanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thierry%20Maulnier\"&gt;Thierry Maulnier&lt;/a&gt;...) have recognised their debt toward Barr\u00e8s, who also inspired several generations of writers (among which &lt;a href=\"Henry%20de%20Montherlant\"&gt;Montherlant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Malraux\"&gt;Malraux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mauriac\"&gt;Mauriac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Aragon\"&gt;Aragon&lt;/a&gt;).\nBarr\u00e8s was elected deputy of the Seine in 1906, and retained his seat until his death. He sat at that time among the &lt;a href=\"Entente%20r%C3%A9publicaine%20d%C3%A9mocratique\"&gt;Entente r\u00e9publicaine d\u00e9mocratique&lt;/a&gt; conservative party. In 1908, he opposed in Parliament his friend and political opponent &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Jaur%C3%A8s\"&gt;Jean Jaur\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, refusing the Socialist leader's will to &lt;a href=\"Panth%C3%A9on%2C%20Paris\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;ize the writer &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Zola\"&gt;\u00c9mile Zola&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his political views, he was one of the first to show his respect to Jaur\u00e8s' remains after his assassination on the eve of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring World War I, Barr\u00e8s was one of the proponents of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Sacr%C3%A9e\"&gt;Union Sacr\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, which earned him the nickname \"nightingale of bloodshed\" (\"rossignol des carnages\"). The \"&lt;a href=\"Canard%20encha%C3%AEn%C3%A9\"&gt;Canard encha\u00een\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" satirical newspaper called him the \"chief of the tribe of brainwashers\" (\"chef de la tribu des bourreurs de cr\u00e2ne\"). His personal notes showed however that he himself did not always believe in his purported war optimism, being at times close to defeatism. During the war Barr\u00e8s also partly came back on the mistakes of his youth, by paying tribute to French Jews in \"Les familles spirituelles de la France\", where he placed them as one of the four elements of the \"national genius\", alongside Traditionalists, Protestants and Socialists \u2013 thus opposing himself to Maurras who saw in them the \"four confederate states\" of \"Anti-France\".\nAfter World War I, Barr\u00e8s demanded the annexation of &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; into the French Republic, and also sought to increase French influence in the &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 June 1920, the National Assembly adopted his draft aiming to establish a national day in remembrance of &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt;.\nNationalism.\nBarr\u00e8s is considered, alongside &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Maurras\"&gt;Charles Maurras&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the main thinkers of &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20nationalism\"&gt;ethnic nationalism&lt;/a&gt; at the turn of the century in France, associated with &lt;a href=\"Revanchism\"&gt;Revanchism&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the desire to reconquer the &lt;a href=\"Alsace-Lorraine\"&gt;Alsace-Lorraine&lt;/a&gt;, annexed by the newly created &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 1871 &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; (Barr\u00e8s was aged 8 at that time). In fact, he himself popularised the word \"nationalism\" in French.\nThis has been noted by &lt;a href=\"Zeev%20Sternhell\"&gt;Zeev Sternhell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Winock\"&gt;Michel Winock&lt;/a&gt; (who titled the first part of his book, \"Le Si\u00e8cle des intellectuels\", \"Les Ann\u00e9es Barr\u00e8s\" (\"The Barr\u00e8s' Years\"), followed by \"Les Ann\u00e9es &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Gide\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Gide&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Les Ann\u00e9es &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Sartre\"&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Andr%C3%A9%20Taguieff\"&gt;Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff&lt;/a&gt;, etc. He shared as common points with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bourget\"&gt;Paul Bourget&lt;/a&gt; his disdain for &lt;a href=\"utilitarianism\"&gt;utilitarianism&lt;/a&gt; and liberalism.\nOpposed to &lt;a href=\"Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau\"&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau&lt;/a&gt;'s theory of &lt;a href=\"social%20contract\"&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt;, Barr\u00e8s considered the 'Nation' (which he used to replace the 'People') as already historically founded: it did not need a \"&lt;a href=\"general%20will\"&gt;general will&lt;/a&gt;\" to establish itself, thus also contrasting with &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Renan\"&gt;Ernest Renan&lt;/a&gt;'s definition of the Nation. Much closer to &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder\"&gt;Herder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte\"&gt;Fichte&lt;/a&gt; than to Renan in his definition of the Nation, Barr\u00e8s opposed French &lt;a href=\"centralism\"&gt;centralism&lt;/a&gt; (as did Maurras), as he considered the Nation to be a multiplicity of local allegiances, first to the family, the village, the region, and ultimately to the &lt;a href=\"nation-state\"&gt;nation-state&lt;/a&gt;. Influenced by &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Burke\"&gt;Edmund Burke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Le%20Play\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hippolyte%20Taine\"&gt;Hippolyte Taine&lt;/a&gt;, he developed an &lt;a href=\"organicist\"&gt;organicist&lt;/a&gt; conception of the Nation which contrasted with the universalism of the 1789 &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen\"&gt;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&lt;/a&gt;. According to Barr\u00e8s, the People is not founded by an act of autonomy, but find its origins in the earth (le sol), history (institutions, life and material conditions) and traditions and inheritance (\"the dead\"). His early individualism was quickly superated by an organicist theory of the social link, in which \"the individual is nothing, society is everything\").\nBarr\u00e8s feared miscegenation of modern times, represented by Paris, claiming against &lt;a href=\"Edmond%20Michelet\"&gt;Michelet&lt;/a&gt; that it jeopardised the unity of the Nation. The Nation was to be balanced between various local nationalities (he spoke of the \"Lorraine nationality\" as much as of the \"French nationality\") through decentralisation and the call for a leader, giving a &lt;a href=\"Bonapartist\"&gt;Bonapartist&lt;/a&gt; aspect to his thought which explained his attraction for the General Boulanger and his opposition to &lt;a href=\"liberal%20democracy\"&gt;liberal democracy&lt;/a&gt;. He pleaded for a &lt;a href=\"direct%20democracy\"&gt;direct democracy&lt;/a&gt; and personalisation of power, as well as for the implementation of &lt;a href=\"popular%20referendum\"&gt;popular referendum&lt;/a&gt;s as done in &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Federal%20Constitution\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. In this nationalist frame, anti-Semitism was to be the cohesive factor for a right-wing &lt;a href=\"mass%20movement\"&gt;mass movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nContrary to popular belief, Maurice Barr\u00e8s never used the term \u201cle grand remplacement\u201d [great replacement], either in his novel \"L'appel au soldat\" or anywhere else. However he did make use of the underlying concept, namely that the French national character was being harmed by immigration of certain ethnic groups.\nHispanophilia.\nBarr\u00e8s was a noted hispanophile. Influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; mythification of Spain, he described the country as \"an Africa leaving your soul with a sort of furor so fast as chilli does in your mouth\". Always passionate about the \"South\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Orientalism\"&gt;Orient&lt;/a&gt;\", he emphasized in his work the period of Moorish domination. He interpreted the Spain of the time as a nation refractory to the attempts of economic and bureaucratic rationalization threatening his own country. He visited Spain in 1892, 1893 and 1902, capturing his vision of the country in his writings, taking a particular interest in &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDada and Barr\u00e8s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dada\"&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;ists organised in spring 1921 the trial of Barr\u00e8s, charged with an \"attack on the safety of the mind\" (\"attentat \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l'esprit\") and sentenced him to 20 years of forced labour. This fictitious trial also marked the dissolution of Dada - its founders, among whom was &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20Tzara\"&gt;Tristan Tzara&lt;/a&gt;, refusing any form of justice even if organised by Dada.\nFinal years and death.\nAn Orientalist romance, \"&lt;a href=\"Un%20jardin%20sur%20l%27Oronte\"&gt;Un jardin sur l'Oronte&lt;/a&gt;\" (A Garden on the Orontes)\u2014which would be the basis of &lt;a href=\"Un%20jardin%20sur%20l%27Oronte%20%28opera%29\"&gt;an opera of the same name&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was published in 1922, triggering what would be called (the Orontes Quarrel).\nBarr\u00e8s died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 4 December 1923."
