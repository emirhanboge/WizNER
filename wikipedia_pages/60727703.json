    "text": "Erythrina berteroana is a species of small deciduous tree in the family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is found in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America. Common names include elequeme, gallito, machete, pernila de casa, pito and por\u00f3 de cerca. It is a common tree in the drier parts of its range and has many traditional uses.\nDescription.\nA small deciduous tree growing to a height of , \"E. berteroana\" has a maximum diameter of at chest height. The branches are smooth and thorny. The leaves are alternate, borne on &lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petioles&lt;/a&gt; up to long, are trifoliate, each leaflet being ovate or rhomboidal, up to wide and long, with acuminate apexes and cuneate bases. The &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt;, up to long, is terminal and is of the &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt; type. The flowers are pink or red, appearing at the same time as the leaves. They are large and tubular, each with a banner, wings and keels, nine &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s bunched together and one free, and a long &lt;a href=\"Gynoecium%23Pistils\"&gt;pistil&lt;/a&gt;. They are followed by curling, woody pods up to long, containing several bean-like seeds. The tree usually blooms from December to March, with &lt;a href=\"pollination\"&gt;pollination&lt;/a&gt; being performed by &lt;a href=\"hummingbird\"&gt;hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;s, usually by &lt;a href=\"long-billed%20starthroat\"&gt;long-billed starthroat&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Heliomaster longirostris\").\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Erythrina berteroana\" is native to southern Mexico, Central America, Guatemala and Venezuela. It grows at altitudes of up to in areas where the annual precipitation is between . It prefers acidic soils (to &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; 4) and tolerates high levels of &lt;a href=\"aluminium\"&gt;aluminium&lt;/a&gt; in the soil. It flourishes in a range of temperatures and is probably frost resistant.\nUses.\nProbably the most common lowland tree in the drier parts of Central America, it has many uses. The shoots and unopened flowers are cooked as a vegetable, and the young foliage is used as fodder for cattle. Cut branches are thrust into the ground to take root and grow into living fencing posts. The roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules which enrich the soil. The tree provides shade in coffee plantations and is used as living stakes for growing &lt;a href=\"Yam%20%28vegetable%29\"&gt;yams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chayote\"&gt;chayote&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves make a useful mulch. The bark and seeds contain toxic &lt;a href=\"alkaloid\"&gt;alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;s and can be used to prepare a poison. The timber is lightweight and coarse, but can be carved into objects and used like &lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28material%29\"&gt;cork&lt;/a&gt;. A yellow dye can be extracted from the bark, and the flowers, leaves and bark are used in &lt;a href=\"traditional%20medicine\"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt;."
