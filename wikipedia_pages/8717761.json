    "text": "Banksia subulata, commonly known as the awled honeypot, is a species of bushy, prostrate shrub that is &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest of Western Australia. It has long linear leaves with the edges turned under, yellowish green flowers in heads of about sixty and more or less spherical &lt;a href=\"Follicle%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;follicles&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\n\"Banksia subulata\" is a bushy, prostrate shrub that typically grows to a width of but does not form a &lt;a href=\"lignotuber\"&gt;lignotuber&lt;/a&gt;. It has linear leaves that are long and wide on a &lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt; up to long and with the edges turned under. The flowers are yellowish green and arranged in heads of between sixty-five and seventy-five with many leaf-like, &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23subulate\"&gt;subulate&lt;/a&gt; bracts long and lance-shaped &lt;a href=\"Bract%23Involucral%20bracts\"&gt;involucral bracts&lt;/a&gt; long at the base of the head. The &lt;a href=\"perianth\"&gt;perianth&lt;/a&gt; is long and the &lt;a href=\"Gynoecium%23Pistils\"&gt;pistil&lt;/a&gt; long. Flowering occurs from September to October and the fruit is an almost spherical &lt;a href=\"Follicle%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;follicle&lt;/a&gt; about wide.\nTaxonomy.\nThis species was first published as \"Dryandra subulata\" in 1964 by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gardner%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;Charles Gardner&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;\" from specimens he collected near the &lt;a href=\"Hill%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Hill River&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Alex%20George\"&gt;Alex George&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra\"&gt;1996 arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, this species was recognised as quite distinctive, being unusual in its long, unserrated leaves, its rigid awl-shaped floral leaves, and its round follicles. With no obvious relatives, the species was placed alone in a new series named \"Dryandra\" ser. \"Subulatae\".\nSince 1998, &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Mast\"&gt;Austin Mast&lt;/a&gt; has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of &lt;a href=\"DNA%20sequence\"&gt;DNA sequence&lt;/a&gt; data for the subtribe &lt;a href=\"Banksiinae\"&gt;Banksiinae&lt;/a&gt;. His analyses have provided evidence of the &lt;a href=\"paraphyly\"&gt;paraphyly&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia\"&gt;Banksia&lt;/a&gt;\" with respect to \"&lt;a href=\"Dryandra\"&gt;Dryandra&lt;/a&gt;\"; that is, it seems that \"Dryandra\" arose from within the ranks of \"Banksia\". Early in 2007, Mast and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Thiele\"&gt;Kevin Thiele&lt;/a&gt; initiated a rearrangement of \"Banksia\" by sinking \"Dryandra\" into it; \"Dryandra subulata\" thus became \"Banksia subulata\". Mast's analyses placed \"B.\u00a0subulata\" not with the other \"Dryandra\" species sampled, but rather within a small clade of \"Banksia\" species with independently reduced inflorescence axes. For this reason, \"B.\u00a0subulata\" was placed \"&lt;a href=\"incertae%20sedis\"&gt;incertae sedis&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia\"&gt;\"B.\"\u00a0subg. \"Banksia\"&lt;/a&gt;, rather than in &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra\"&gt;\"B.\"\u00a0ser. \"Dryandra\"&lt;/a&gt; with the other \"Dryandra\" species.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Banksia subulata\" grows in low &lt;a href=\"kwongan\"&gt;kwongan&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Eneabba%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Eneabba&lt;/a&gt; and the Hill River. \nConservation status.\nThis banksia is classified as \"&lt;a href=\"Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List\"&gt;Priority Three&lt;/a&gt;\" by the Government of Western Australia &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Department of Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat."
