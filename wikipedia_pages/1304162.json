    "text": "Eros Walter Luciano Ramazzotti (; born 28 October 1963) is an Italian musician, singer and songwriter. Ramazzotti is popular in Italy and most European countries, and throughout the Spanish-speaking world, as he has released most of his albums in both Italian and Spanish.\nSince 1984, Ramazzotti has released 11 studio albums, one &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, three compilation albums, three live albums, and 37 singles. He has sold over 60 million records in his 30-year career. His repertoire includes duets with artists such as &lt;a href=\"Cher\"&gt;Cher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Turner\"&gt;Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Bocelli\"&gt;Andrea Bocelli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patsy%20Kensit\"&gt;Patsy Kensit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anastacia\"&gt;Anastacia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Cocker\"&gt;Joe Cocker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Iglesias\"&gt;Julio Iglesias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lynn%20Davis%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Lynn Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Arjona\"&gt;Ricardo Arjona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luciano%20Pavarotti\"&gt;Luciano Pavarotti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Pausini\"&gt;Laura Pausini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Scherzinger\"&gt;Nicole Scherzinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Martin\"&gt;Ricky Martin&lt;/a&gt;.\nRamazzotti first gained international success in 1993, with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Tutte%20storie\"&gt;Tutte storie&lt;/a&gt;\", which amassed five million album sales and occupied the top five in every country where he had previously released albums. This success led to a &lt;a href=\"Bertelsmann%20Music%20Group\"&gt;BMG International&lt;/a&gt; record contract in 1994. His audience appeal comes from several factors, including his unique voice, which can be described as somewhat nasal but nevertheless forceful and resonant &lt;a href=\"baritone\"&gt;baritone&lt;/a&gt;, and his energetic delivery of catchy, melodic tunes which are often passionate mid-tempo autobiographical ballads, with instrumentation that is rich in soft-rock influence.\nBiography.\nChildhood and early beginnings (1963\u20131981).\nRamazzotti was born in Cinecitt\u00e0 Est, a suburb of Rome. He is the son of Rodolfo Ramazzotti, a construction worker and Raffaela Molina, a housewife. His father originated from the province of &lt;a href=\"Viterbo\"&gt;Viterbo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; and his mother from the province of &lt;a href=\"Vibo%20Valentia\"&gt;Vibo Valentia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Calabria\"&gt;Calabria&lt;/a&gt;. He was named after &lt;a href=\"Eros\"&gt;Eros&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek god of love. He began playing the guitar at age seven. As a teenager, he wrote songs with the help of his father who was a music lover and played piano. He wanted to attend a musical conservatory but failed the admission examination, and started training in bookkeeping, but dropped out. He occasionally appeared as an extra in films while dreaming of having a career as a pop-star.\nIn 1981, Ramazzotti took part in a music contest, \"&lt;a href=\"Castrocaro%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Voci Nuove di Castrocaro&lt;/a&gt;\" (New Voices of &lt;a href=\"Castrocaro%20Terme\"&gt;Castrocaro Terme&lt;/a&gt;) with the song \"Rock 80\", which he wrote, performing in front of various record label representatives. Although the contest was won by &lt;a href=\"Zucchero\"&gt;Zucchero&lt;/a&gt; and Fiordaliso, Ramazzotti reached the final and received two votes from Roberto Galanti and Baron Lando Lanni, who represented the recently launched Italian Label DDD (Drogueria di Drugolo). DDD gave Eros his first contract. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; with his brother Marco and his mother Raffaella, and they initially lived in the same building as the record label company.\nCareer breakthrough (1982\u20131986).\nRamazzotti's first single, \"Ad un amico\" (To a Friend), was released in 1982, and was not particularly well received. Soon after, Eros met Renato Brioschi, who mentored the young artist toward his first success in 1984 at the highly regarded &lt;a href=\"Festival%20della%20canzone%20italiana\"&gt;Sanremo Festival&lt;/a&gt;. His song, \"Terra promessa\" (Promised Land) won the Newcomers' category, and was subsequently released widely throughout Europe.\nIn 1985, Ramazzotti took part in the Sanremo Festival again with the song \"Una storia importante\" (An Important Story), taken from his debut album \"&lt;a href=\"Cuori%20agitati\"&gt;Cuori agitati&lt;/a&gt;\" (Troubled Hearts). While only placing sixth at the festival, \"Una storia importante\" was released as a single and became a huge hit in many European countries, including France where it sold a million units.\nHis second album \"&lt;a href=\"Nuovi%20eroi\"&gt;Nuovi eroi&lt;/a&gt;\" (New Heroes), released in 1986, earned two Platinum-awards in Switzerland with over 100,000 sales, and Gold status in Germany with over 250,000 sales. At his second Sanremo Festival appearance in 1986 his memorable single, \"&lt;a href=\"Adesso%20tu\"&gt;Adesso tu&lt;/a&gt;\" (Now You) from \"Nuovi eroi\" won the overall competition.\nPopularity established (1987\u20131994).\nIn 1987, Ramazzotti went on a nine-month-long tour after releasing his third album \"&lt;a href=\"In%20certi%20momenti\"&gt;In certi momenti&lt;/a&gt;\" (Sometimes), performing in front of more than a million people. \"In certi momenti\" went Gold in Germany with over 250,000 sales and Platinum in Switzerland with over 50,000 sales, and reached more than 3 million copies worldwide. As his career developed, he performed \"La Luce Buona Delle Stelle\" (The Good Light of the Stars) with &lt;a href=\"Patsy%20Kensit\"&gt;Patsy Kensit&lt;/a&gt; on 22 November 1987, and released a seven-track mini-album \"&lt;a href=\"Musica%20%C3%A8\"&gt;Musica \u00e8&lt;/a&gt;\" (Music Is) in May 1988.\nHis fifth album, \"&lt;a href=\"In%20ogni%20senso\"&gt;In ogni senso&lt;/a&gt;\" (In Every Sense), released in April 1990, attracted more than two hundred journalists from around the world to the album's press conference launch in &lt;a href=\"Venice%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn American record producer, &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Davis\"&gt;Clive Davis&lt;/a&gt;, advised Ramazzotti to hold a concert at the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall\"&gt;Radio City Music Hall&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, and he became the first Italian artist to perform at the renowned concert hall, performing before a sell-out crowd. However, he was later disappointed to learn that most of his audience was of Italian descent, having hoped for a more widespread breakthrough. During that visit to the US, Ramazzotti also performed on TV shows like &lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno\"&gt;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Good%20Morning%20America\"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;. \"In ogni senso\" earned multiple Gold and Platinum album awards around the world, including a Platinum in Germany for over 500,000 sales, a triple Platinum in Switzerland for over 150,000 sales, and Platinum in the Netherlands for sales of over 100,000 units.\nHis 1991 double-CD release \"Eros in Concert\" was followed by another long tour, including a concert in Barcelona, Spain before 20,000 fans on 4 December, the day of his live CD's release.\nIn 1993, he released \"&lt;a href=\"Tutte%20storie\"&gt;Tutte storie&lt;/a&gt;\" (All Stories), and he toured in Europe and 15 Latin American countries, where he has released his Spanish language albums. That November, Ramazzotti performed \"Cose della vita\" (Things of Life) at the &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;MTV Europe Music Awards&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. \"Tutte storie\" entered the Top-5 album list in many countries in Europe including Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. The album earned Ramazzotti four Platinums in Switzerland for sales of over 200,000 units, a Platinum in Germany for sales of over 500,000 units, and Platinum status in many other counties including the Netherlands, Sweden, Argentina and Austria. \"Tutte storie\" eventually sold five million copies worldwide which played a significant role in helping Ramazzotti get his contract with BMG International.\nWorldwide commercial success (1995\u20132002).\nIn the summer of 1995, Ramazzotti participated in the European summer festival along with &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Stewart\"&gt;Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elton%20John\"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Cocker\"&gt;Joe Cocker&lt;/a&gt;. His six-million-seller album, \"&lt;a href=\"Dove%20c%27%C3%A8%20musica\"&gt;Dove c'\u00e8 musica&lt;/a&gt;\" (Where There Is Music) was released on 13 May 1996, his first completely self-produced album. On 5 December of the same year, his companion of several years and future wife &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Hunziker\"&gt;Michelle Hunziker&lt;/a&gt; (Swiss model and television host) gave birth to their daughter, Aurora Sophie.\nIn October 1997, he released \"&lt;a href=\"Eros%20%28Eros%20Ramazzotti%20album%29\"&gt;Eros&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Greatest Hits\", which contained two new songs, \"Quanto amore sei\" (How Much Love Are You) and \"Ancora un minuto di sole\" (Just One More Minute of Sunshine), as well as reworked versions of previous hits including \"Musica \u00e8\" (duet with &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Bocelli\"&gt;Andrea Bocelli&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"Cose%20Della%20Vita%23Eros%20Ramazzotti%20and%20Tina%20Turner%20version\"&gt;Cose Delle Vita-Can't Stop Thinking of You&lt;/a&gt;\" as a duet with &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Turner\"&gt;Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt;. This collection entered the Top-5 in France, Belgium, Sweden and Finland, and reached No. 1 in several countries including Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Norway, selling 1.2 million units in its first week of release according to BMG International.\nThe album was certified five times Platinum by IFPI (Europe) for selling well over five million units in Europe alone. The album also attained two Latin-type Platinum certifications by RIAA for sales of over 400,000 units in USA. That year, Ramazzotti was awarded \"Best International Male Artist of the Year\" at Germany's &lt;a href=\"ECHO%20%28music%20award%29\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; Music Awards.\nIn 1998, he released the live CD \"Eros Live\", which included two duets recorded during the world tour, \"Cose della vita-Can\u2019t Stop Thinking of You\" featuring Tina Turner, and \"That's All I Need to Know-Difender\u00f2\" with &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Cocker\"&gt;Joe Cocker&lt;/a&gt;, performed in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, Ramazzotti again collaborated with Italian superstar &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Bocelli\"&gt;Andrea Bocelli&lt;/a&gt;, singing \"Nel Cuore Lei\" (In Your Heart) for Bocelli's album, \"&lt;a href=\"Sogno\"&gt;Sogno&lt;/a&gt;\" (Dream). The album sold over 10 million albums worldwide, gaining more recognition for Ramazzotti.
