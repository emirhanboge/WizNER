    "text": "A depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company's &lt;a href=\"Public%20company\"&gt;publicly traded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28finance%29\"&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt;. The depositary receipt trades on a local &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Depositary receipts facilitates buying shares in foreign companies, because the shares do not have to leave the home country.\nDepositary receipts that are listed and traded in the United States are &lt;a href=\"American%20depositary%20receipt\"&gt;American depositary receipt&lt;/a&gt;s (ADRs). European banks issue &lt;a href=\"European%20depositary%20receipt\"&gt;European depositary receipt&lt;/a&gt;s (EDRs), and other banks issue &lt;a href=\"global%20depository%20receipts\"&gt;global depository receipts&lt;/a&gt; (GDRs).\nHow it works.\nA depositary receipt typically requires a company to meet a stock exchange\u2019s specific rules before listing its stock for sale. For example, a company must transfer shares to a &lt;a href=\"brokerage\"&gt;brokerage&lt;/a&gt; house in its home country. Upon receipt, the brokerage uses a &lt;a href=\"custodian%20bank\"&gt;custodian&lt;/a&gt; connected to the international stock exchange for selling the depositary receipts. This connection ensures that the shares of stock actually exist and no manipulation occurs between the foreign company and the international brokerage house.\nA typical ADR goes through the following steps before it is issued:\nOther forms of multi-exchange trading.\nDRs should not be confused with other methods that allow a company's stock to be traded in multiple exchanges, such as:\nTypes of DR.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"CREST%20Depositary%20Interest\"&gt;CREST Depositary Interest&lt;/a&gt;s (CDIs) in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; function similarly, but not identically to depositary receipts."
