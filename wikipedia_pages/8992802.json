    "text": "Go After an Easy Prey (Chinese: \u74ee\u4e2d\u6349\u9cd6) is a &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20animation\"&gt;Chinese animated&lt;/a&gt; film in black and white from 1948. It is also referred to as \"Turtle Caught in a Jar\".\nTranslation.\nThe title of the film is a phrase describing something as easy to catch as a turtle. The off English translation may be \"&lt;a href=\"shooting%20fish%20in%20a%20barrel\"&gt;shooting fish in a barrel&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBackground.\nThe film was produced by the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Film%20Studio\"&gt;Northeast Film Studio&lt;/a&gt; during its transitional phase with the downfall of the puppet government &lt;a href=\"Manchukuo\"&gt;Manchukuo&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nThe film is believed to be more of a documentary view of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;China's civil war&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s when &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; was considered to be favored and aided by U.S &lt;a href=\"imperialism\"&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt;. He was metaphorically described as trapped like a turtle by the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army\"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;."
