    "text": "\"Riot dog\" is a term used by English-speaking media denoting any of the &lt;a href=\"Free-ranging%20dog\"&gt;stray dogs&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied &lt;a href=\"street%20protester\"&gt;street protester&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20financial%20crisis\"&gt;2008 financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;, when the country was plunged into a severe recession by the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20government-debt%20crisis\"&gt;Greek government-debt crisis&lt;/a&gt;. It has been observed that a number of these dogs remained among the protesters even when violent &lt;a href=\"rioting\"&gt;rioting&lt;/a&gt; breaks out. Greece's Riot Dogs acquired a large following of fans around the world via the media of the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of the protests of the &lt;a href=\"everyman\"&gt;everyman&lt;/a&gt; against an &lt;a href=\"oligarchy\"&gt;oligarchic&lt;/a&gt; government state.\nThe dogs.\nKanellos (: cinnamon), a distinct blonde, male, mixed-breed canine, was arguably the first incarnation of the Greek Riot Dog. His maiden appearance was in photographs taken at a general assembly of students in the occupied &lt;a href=\"National%20Technical%20University%20of%20Athens\"&gt;National Technical University of Athens&lt;/a&gt;. Kanellos became famous in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Greek%20riots\"&gt;2008 Greek riots&lt;/a&gt;, when Greek photographers and cameramen started to notice a dog that kept appearing in their footage. The stray seemed to always walk amongst and side with the protesters.\nAccording to reports by witnesses, Kanellos, in his final years, suffered from &lt;a href=\"arthritis\"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, which motivated a group of college students to collect money and purchase him a dog's &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed him to live indoors, among the students, until he died.\nThodoris () is a Kanellos look-alike, believed to be one of Kanellos' pups. Thodoris is a light golden-colored, mixed breed dog, who, despite being a stray, has seemingly been provided with all the necessary medical shots, as evidenced by his blue collar.\n&lt;a href=\"Loukanikos\"&gt;Loukanikos&lt;/a&gt; (: the sausage &lt;a href=\"loukaniko\"&gt;loukaniko&lt;/a&gt;) or more commonly Louk (), sometimes confused by the media for Kanellos, has been present at nearly every recent protest in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years. This stray has ostensibly become the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Greece%232010%E2%80%932018%20government%20debt%20crisis\"&gt;Greek protests&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=\"European%20Central%20Bank\"&gt;ECB&lt;/a&gt;-prompted &lt;a href=\"austerity\"&gt;austerity&lt;/a&gt; measures. There's uncertainty about the claim that Loukanikos and Thodoris may, in fact, be the same dog however this was later confirmed false after Loukanikos died due to ingestion of tear gas, due to constant protesting.\nIn September 2011, on the occasion of a striking policemen's union marching in the centre of Athens, Loukanikos, according to eyewitnesses, was \"initially confused\" between two opposite sides both of uniformed policemen but, when the riot police contingent attacked their striking colleagues, the dog sided with \"those who were being attacked.\"\nLoukanikos' health was \"severely burdened\" by the inhaling of &lt;a href=\"tear%20gas\"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; and other chemicals during the many riots in which he participated but lived until approximately ten years of age, dying peacefully on 9 October 2014 at the home of a person who cared for him.\nOther dogs.\nIn Chile, in the 2010s, a stray dog has been seen accompanying student protests. Protesters named him \"&lt;a href=\"Negro%20Matapacos\"&gt;Negro Matapacos&lt;/a&gt;\" (from Spanish \"matar\", to kill, and \"paco\", which is &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20police-related%20slang%20terms%23P\"&gt;Chilean slang for \"policeman\"&lt;/a&gt;; his full nickname therefore translates to \"Black Cop-killer\"), or refer to him simply as \"El Negro\". Matapacos died on 26 August 2017 of old age with a veterinarian and people by his side.\nDuring the Chilean protests of 2019\u20132020, other dogs have been seen along Chilean protesters. Such is the case of Pepe Matapacos (shortened as \"Pepe\") in Concepci\u00f3n and Vaquita (\"little cow\" because of his white and black-dotted fur) in Antofagasta.\nIn culture.\nIn 2011, American singer/songwriter &lt;a href=\"David%20Rovics\"&gt;David Rovics&lt;/a&gt; released a song entitled \"The Riot Dog\".\nLoukanikos appears as a &lt;a href=\"non-playable%20character\"&gt;non-playable character&lt;/a&gt; in the video game \"&lt;a href=\"Tonight%20We%20Riot\"&gt;Tonight We Riot&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he assists the player in a left-wing revolution."
