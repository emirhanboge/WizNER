    "text": "Eucalyptus incerata, commonly known as Mount Day mallee, is a species of &lt;a href=\"Mallee%20%28habit%29\"&gt;mallee&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to southern Western Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds with a long, horn-shaped &lt;a href=\"Operculum%20%28botany%29\"&gt;operculum&lt;/a&gt; and arranged in groups of seven, yellow flowers and barrel-shaped to cup-shaped fruit.\nDescription.\n\"Eucalyptus incerata\" is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a &lt;a href=\"lignotuber\"&gt;lignotuber&lt;/a&gt;. It has smooth, light greyish brown bark. Adult plants have lance-shaped leaves that are the same shade of green on both sides, long and wide on a &lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt; long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched &lt;a href=\"Peduncle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;peduncle&lt;/a&gt; long, the individual buds on &lt;a href=\"Pedicel%20%28botany%29\"&gt;pedicels&lt;/a&gt; long. Mature buds are shaped more or less like long, thin spindles, long and wide with an operculum at least twice as long as the &lt;a href=\"Hypanthium\"&gt;floral cup&lt;/a&gt;. Flowering has been seen in October and the flowers are creamy yellow. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to cup-shaped &lt;a href=\"Capsule%20%28botany%29\"&gt;capsule&lt;/a&gt; long and wide with the valves near rim level.\nTaxonomy and naming.\n\"Eucalyptus incerata\" was first described in 2002 by &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Brooker\"&gt;Ian Brooker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Hopper\"&gt;Stephen Hopper&lt;/a&gt; from a specimen collected in 1983 near Mount Day, between &lt;a href=\"Hyden%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Hyden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norseman%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Norseman&lt;/a&gt;. The description was published in the journal \"&lt;a href=\"Nuytsia%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Nuytsia&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Botanical%20name\"&gt;specific epithet&lt;/a&gt; (\"incerata\") is from the Latin \"inceratus\", meaning 'covered with wax', referring to the waxy deposit on the branchlets, buds and fruit of this species.\nDistribution and habitat.\nMount Day mallee is found in &lt;a href=\"Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands\"&gt;mallee scrub&lt;/a&gt; among sandplains and on ridges between Hyden, Norseman and &lt;a href=\"Coolgardie%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Coolgardie, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Wheatbelt\"&gt;Avon Wheatbelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coolgardie%20%28biogeographic%20region%29\"&gt;Coolgardie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mallee%20%28biogeographic%20region%29\"&gt;Mallee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"IBRA\"&gt;biogeographic regions&lt;/a&gt; where it grows in yellow sandy lateritic soils.\nConservation status.\nThis mallee is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Department of Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;."
