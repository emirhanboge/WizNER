    "text": "\"Anacani\" Mar\u00eda Consuelo Castillo-L\u00f3pez y Cantor-Montoya (born April 10, 1954) is a Mexican &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; best known as a featured performer on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lawrence%20Welk%20Show\"&gt;The Lawrence Welk Show&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"television\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; program.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Sinaloa\"&gt;Sinaloa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, as the sixth of seven children of &lt;a href=\"Spaniards\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; parents, she moved with her family to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; when she was a child. It was during that time she began to sing thanks in large part to her family's talented musical background. When she was in &lt;a href=\"middle%20school\"&gt;middle school&lt;/a&gt;, during a family trip back to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, her singing talents were discovered by a &lt;a href=\"television%20producer\"&gt;television producer&lt;/a&gt; which led to appearances on the &lt;a href=\"variety%20show\"&gt;variety show&lt;/a&gt; \"Las Estrellas y Usted\" (The Stars and You) followed by several more appearances on &lt;a href=\"Latin%20American\"&gt;Latin American&lt;/a&gt; television and live concert tours as well.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt;, Anacani's career took a new turn when she and her family went to the &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Welk%23Legacy\"&gt;Lawrence Welk Resort&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Escondido%2C%20California\"&gt;Escondido, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she was discovered by bandleader &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Welk\"&gt;Lawrence Welk&lt;/a&gt; himself. Soon enough, she was the resort's singing hostess and later made her first appearance on the \"&lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Welk%20Show\"&gt;Lawrence Welk Show&lt;/a&gt;\" in January 1973. After a few more guest appearances, she was soon hired as a regular performer on the show.\nDuring the course of the show's run, and afterward, she was popular as a soloist with songs like \"Vaya Con Dios\", \"Luna\", and \"It's Impossible\". She also did duets with fellow Welk star &lt;a href=\"Tanya%20Falan\"&gt;Tanya Falan&lt;/a&gt;, toured with rest of the music makers on the road and released an album called \"Lawrence Welk presents Anacani\" through &lt;a href=\"Ranwood%20Records\"&gt;Ranwood Records&lt;/a&gt; and she serves as the &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans\"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spokesman\"&gt;spokesman&lt;/a&gt; for Yuban Coffee. She also had a &lt;a href=\"bit%20part\"&gt;bit part&lt;/a&gt; in the 1981 feature film &lt;a href=\"Zoot%20Suit\"&gt;Zoot Suit&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, Anacani lives in Escondido with her husband Rudy Echeverria and her daughter Priscila. In addition to singing, she is also an accomplished &lt;a href=\"clothing%20designer\"&gt;clothing designer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"seamstress\"&gt;seamstress&lt;/a&gt;. She still sings with members of her Welk musical family across the country at &lt;a href=\"county%20fairs\"&gt;county fairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"resorts\"&gt;resorts&lt;/a&gt; plus many other venues. She is also a guest soloist with many &lt;a href=\"symphony%20orchestras\"&gt;symphony orchestras&lt;/a&gt;; and since the early 1980s has worked the &lt;a href=\"telethon\"&gt;telethon&lt;/a&gt; for the West Texas Rehabilitation Center in &lt;a href=\"Abilene%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Abilene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;."
