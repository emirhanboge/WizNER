    "text": "Meredith Creek (also known as Brookside Run) is a &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lackawanna%20River\"&gt;Lackawanna River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lackawanna%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. According to &lt;a href=\"The%20National%20Map\"&gt;The National Map&lt;/a&gt;, it is approximately long and flows through &lt;a href=\"Carbondale%20Township%2C%20Lackawanna%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Carbondale Township&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbondale%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Carbondale&lt;/a&gt;. The creek is highly impacted by mining and experiences some flow loss. It is a small, first-order stream. Historic sites such as the New York, Ontario and Western Rail Yard and the Brookside Cemetery are in the creek's watershed.\nCourse.\nMeredith Creek begins in Carbondale Township. It flows east for a short distance, almost immediately entering Carbondale and flowing along the border between in and Carbondale Township. Several hundred feet further downstream, it turns southeast for a short distance, reentering Carbondale Township and crossing a highway. The creek then reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.\nMeredith Creek joins the Lackawanna River approximately upriver of its mouth.\nHydrology, geography and geology.\nThe elevation near the &lt;a href=\"river%20mouth\"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt; of Meredith Creek is above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation of the creek's &lt;a href=\"river%20source\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; is between above sea level.\nMeredith Creek is highly impacted by &lt;a href=\"strip%20mining\"&gt;strip mining&lt;/a&gt; and experiences flow loss. However, it does retain its &lt;a href=\"stream%20channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"perennial%20stream\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt; flow could be restored to Meredith Creek by lining the creek and regrading strip mine pits along it.\nA portion of a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; known as West Mountain is in the watershed of Meredith Creek.\nWatershed.\nMeredith Creek is entirely within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Geological%20Survey\"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quadrangle%20%28geography%29\"&gt;quadrangle&lt;/a&gt; of Carbondale.\nMeredith Creek is a small &lt;a href=\"Strahler%20number\"&gt;first-order&lt;/a&gt; stream. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan stated that the &lt;a href=\"Lackawanna%20Valley%20Conservancy\"&gt;Lackawanna Valley Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; was available \"to help plan and manage a greenway project\" for the creek.\nHistory.\nMeredith Creek was entered into the &lt;a href=\"Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System\"&gt;Geographic Names Information System&lt;/a&gt; on May 4, 1998. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1793648. The creek is also known as Brookside Run.\nThe former New York, Ontario and Western Rail Yard is located at the mouth of Meredith Creek. A historic burial ground known as the Brookside Cemetery is also in the creek's watershed. During or shortly before the early 2000s, some improvements were made to the cemetery site. This cemetery is described as a \"signifcant cultural resource\" in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan\".\nIn the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Carbondale Township and Carbondale include protection of Meredith Creek in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision."
