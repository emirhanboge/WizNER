    "text": "The Party of Liberty, Unity and Solidarity (, PLUS) was a &lt;a href=\"pro-European\"&gt;pro-European&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"centrist\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; established on October 26, 2018, whose president was Dacian Ciolo\u0219, former prime minister of Romania, elected on January 26, 2019. The party had its origin in the Movement Romania Together, a project to which they gave up due to the setting up delay in court. The party merged in 2021 with the &lt;a href=\"Save%20Romania%20Union\"&gt;Save Romania Union&lt;/a&gt; with which it has been in a political alliance called \"2020 USR-PLUS Alliance\" from 2019 to 2021, then formally activating as a sole, unified party known as &lt;a href=\"USR%20PLUS\"&gt;USR PLUS&lt;/a&gt; (subsequently renamed back to Save Romania Union).\nHistory.\nOn 30 March 2018, former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Prime Minister of Romania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20Ciolo%C8%99\"&gt;Dacian Ciolo\u0219&lt;/a&gt; announced his plans to establish a new political party, the \"Romania Together Movement\" (\"Mi\u0219carea Rom\u00e2nia \u00cempreun\u0103\"), together with some of the former members of the &lt;a href=\"Ciolo%C8%99%20Cabinet\"&gt;Ciolo\u0219 Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Drago%C8%99%20P%C3%AEslaru\"&gt;Drago\u0219 P\u00eeslaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Voiculescu\"&gt;Vlad Voiculescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alin%20Mitu%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Alin Mitu\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, Drago\u0219 Tudorache, and &lt;a href=\"Anca%20Dragu\"&gt;Anca Dragu&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the party gaining notoriety in the subsequent months and appearing in various opinion polls, its official registration was never finalized due to various appeals and delays in the legal process, which &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20Ciolo%C8%99\"&gt;Ciolo\u0219&lt;/a&gt; claimed to be politically motivated.\nAfter almost 9 months, on 15 December, &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20Ciolo%C8%99\"&gt;Ciolo\u0219&lt;/a&gt; announced in &lt;a href=\"Cluj-Napoca\"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt; that the \"Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party\" (\"Partidul Libert\u0103\u021bii, Unit\u0103\u021bii \u0219i Solidarit\u0103\u021bii\", PLUS) was registered by three of his colleagues, \"who share the same values, the same principles, anonymous people, but who wanted to offer a helping hand\". He also claimed that the former effort, the \"Romania Together Movement\", will be abandoned and that he and his team will focus on the development of PLUS. After the announcement, more than 7,500 people requested to join the party in 24 hours.\nThe first National Convention of PLUS, which had the role of electing the president and the National Council of the organization, took place in Bucharest on 26 January 2019. &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20Ciolo%C8%99\"&gt;Dacian Ciolo\u0219&lt;/a&gt; was elected president with 99.17% of the votes. Having previously announced his intention to participate in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Romania\"&gt;European Parliament elections&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20Ciolo%C8%99\"&gt;Ciolo\u0219&lt;/a&gt; was also chosen to lead the PLUS list for the elections.\n&lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cristian%20Preda\"&gt;Cristian Preda&lt;/a&gt; announced on 29 January that he is joining PLUS, allowing the party to have delegates in all polling stations.\nOn the evening of 2 February 2019, it was announced on &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; that PLUS and the &lt;a href=\"Save%20Romania%20Union\"&gt;Save Romania Union&lt;/a&gt; (USR) established the &lt;a href=\"USR%20PLUS\"&gt;2020 USR-PLUS Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which will participate in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Romania\"&gt;2019 European Parliament elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the party was not a member of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party\"&gt;Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party&lt;/a&gt;, all its MEPs were individual members of this European political party.\nIdeology.\nPLUS has not defined its ideology clearly. However, it has published a manifesto on their website, in which it expressed its support for liberty, social justice, transparency in public administration, as well as its commitment to Romania's &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; membership. Ciolo\u0219, the party's president, claimed in an interview that PLUS is situated in \"the &lt;a href=\"Centrism\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Centre-right%20politics\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; area\".\nElectoral history.\nPresidential elections.\nNotes:\n1 \nEuropean elections.\nNotes:\n1 "
