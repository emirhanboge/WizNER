    "text": "Stephen Kinsey (born 2 January 1963) is an English former &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; who began his career in 1979 with &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; before moving to the United States in 1986. He then played professionally in the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Major Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Soccer%20League%20%281988-1989%29\"&gt;American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; and others before retiring in 1997.\nCareer.\nKinsey played for &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; between 1979 and 1986. He played 101 times for the team in &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; and scored 15 goals, including one at Wembley against &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; in the first &lt;a href=\"Full%20Members%20Cup\"&gt;Full Members Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final, before transferring to &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Strikers\"&gt;Minnesota Strikers&lt;/a&gt; in the United States to play indoor football.\nOn 30 October 1986, the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Strikers\"&gt;Minnesota Strikers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Major Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; signed Kinsey. He came into the league after &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Merrick\"&gt;Alan Merrick&lt;/a&gt;, coach of the Strikers saw Kinsey playing in England during the summer of 1986. He was named the 1986\u20131987 Newcomer of the Year. At the completion of the 1988 MISL playoffs in May, Kinsey signed with the outdoor &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lauderdale%20Strikers%20%281988-1994%29\"&gt;Fort Lauderdale Strikers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Soccer%20League%20%281988-1989%29\"&gt;American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. The Strikers went to the ASL championship game where they fell to the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Diplomats\"&gt;Washington Diplomats&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kinsey did not play as he had torn a groin muscle in the semi-finals. In late October 1988, Kinsey signed with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Lazers\"&gt;Los Angeles Lazers&lt;/a&gt; of MISL for the 1988\u201389 indoor season. The nagging groin injury limited Kinsey to nineteen games with the Lazers.\nIn March 1989, he signed with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers for the upcoming outdoor season. Leg injuries continued to hamper Kinsey, leading him to lose six regular season games. The Strikers would go on to win the league championship. When the Los Angeles Lazers folded during the summer, the &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Wings\"&gt;Wichita Wings&lt;/a&gt; of MISL claimed Kinsey in the 12 July dispersal draft. After the Wings failed to tender an offer to Kinsey, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Sidekicks%20%281984-2004%29\"&gt;Dallas Sidekicks&lt;/a&gt; as a free agent. After the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Sockers%20%28NASL%29\"&gt;San Diego Sockers&lt;/a&gt; eliminated the Sidekicks from the playoffs, Kinsey signed with the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Freedom\"&gt;Miami Freedom&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Professional%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;American Professional Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the fall of 1990, Kinsey again returned to the MISL, this time with the &lt;a href=\"Tacoma%20Stars%20%28MISL%29\"&gt;Tacoma Stars&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 June 1991, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Rowdies%20%281975%E2%80%931993%29\"&gt;Tampa Bay Rowdies&lt;/a&gt; of the APSL, but delayed joining the team as his wife was close to delivering a baby in Tacoma. In August 1991, the Rowdies released Kinsey after he failed to score in five games, then spent another seven on the bench. Kinsey then returned to the UK where he played for three teams in quick succession during the 1991\u201392 season: &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coleraine%20F.C.\"&gt;Coleraine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 1992, Kinsey returned to the United States where he signed with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. He rediscovered his scoring touch, bagging goal in his first game and totalling seven in eleven games.\nKinsey returned to Europe where he played for &lt;a href=\"Molde%20FK\"&gt;Molde FK&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Norwegian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1994, Kinsey signed with the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Wave\"&gt;Milwaukee Wave&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"NPSL%20II\"&gt;National Professional Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. Limits on foreign players prevented the Wave from fielding Kinsey, but he was available in the event of injuries to any other players. The team released him at the end of the season.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Neon\"&gt;Detroit Neon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Indoor%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;Continental Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; then drafted Kinsey in April 1994. He played two summer indoor seasons with the Neon. In January 1996, Kinsey signed with the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Terror\"&gt;Tampa Bay Terror&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"NPSL%20II\"&gt;National Professional Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. In March 1996, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Kickers\"&gt;Richmond Kickers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"USISL\"&gt;USISL&lt;/a&gt;. In the fall of 1997, Kinsey signed a series of 15-day contracts with the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Blizzard\"&gt;Buffalo Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; before signing for the remainder of the season in December 1997.\nKinsey has run a summer soccer camp for children in Florida. He splits his time between the US and the UK"
