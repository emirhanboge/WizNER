    "text": "Sacred tradition is a theological term used in major &lt;a href=\"Christian%20tradition\"&gt;Christian tradition&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodoxy\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20East\"&gt;Assyrian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; traditions.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20theology\"&gt;Christian theological&lt;/a&gt; understanding of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches, sacred tradition is the foundation of the doctrinal and spiritual authority of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;; scripture is the written part of this larger tradition, recording (albeit sometimes through the work of individual authors) the community's experience of &lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Christianity\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; or more specifically of Jesus. Thus, the Bible must be interpreted within the context of sacred tradition and within the community of the church. The Anglican and Methodist Churches regard tradition, along with reason, tradition and experience, as \"source of authority\" but subordinate to Scripture--a position known as \"&lt;a href=\"prima%20scriptura\"&gt;prima scriptura&lt;/a&gt;\". That is in contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reformed\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; traditions, which teach that the Bible alone is a sufficient basis for all Christian teaching (a position known as \"&lt;a href=\"sola%20scriptura\"&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/a&gt;\").\nUsage of term.\nThe word \"tradition\" is taken from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"trado, tradere\", meaning \"to hand over, to deliver, to bequeath\". According to Catholic theology, 2 Thessalonians 2:15, Paul exhorted the faithful to \"keep the traditions that we taught you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.\" Paul's letters form part of Sacred Scripture; what he passed on \"by word of mouth\" is part of Sacred Tradition, handed down from the apostles. Both are the inspired word of God; the latter helps to inform understanding of the former. Sacred Tradition can never be in conflict with Sacred Scripture. Protestants note that the verse says either by the word of mouth or by letter, but not that one interprets the other. They also emphasize the reference to \"we\" in the passage as coming directly from the mouth of the apostles. \nHistory.\nAmong the earliest examples of the theological appeal to tradition is the response of early &lt;a href=\"Orthodoxy\"&gt;orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Christianity to &lt;a href=\"Gnosticism\"&gt;Gnosticism&lt;/a&gt;, a movement that used some Christian &lt;a href=\"Religious%20text\"&gt;scripture&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for its teachings. &lt;a href=\"Irenaeus%20of%20Lyons\"&gt;Irenaeus of Lyons&lt;/a&gt; held that '&lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20faith\"&gt;rule of faith&lt;/a&gt;' ('\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2') is preserved by a church through its historical continuity (of interpretation and teaching) with the Apostles. &lt;a href=\"Tertullian\"&gt;Tertullian&lt;/a&gt; argued that although interpretations founded on a reading of all Holy Scripture are not prone to error, tradition is the proper guide. &lt;a href=\"Athanasius\"&gt;Athanasius&lt;/a&gt; held that &lt;a href=\"Arianism\"&gt;Arianism&lt;/a&gt; fell into error primarily by not adhering to tradition.\nIn the modern era, scholars such as &lt;a href=\"Craig%20A.%20Evans\"&gt;Craig A. Evans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Sanders\"&gt;James A. Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20E.%20Porter\"&gt;Stanley E. Porter&lt;/a&gt; have studied how sacred tradition in the Hebrew Bible was understood and used by New Testament writers to describe Jesus.\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20theology\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox theology&lt;/a&gt;, sacred tradition is the inspired revelation of God and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20%28term%29\"&gt;catholic&lt;/a&gt; teaching (Greek \"katholikos\", \"according to the whole\") of the Church, not an independent source of dogmatic authority to be regarded as a supplement to biblical revelation. Tradition is rather understood as the fullness of divine truth proclaimed in the scriptures, preserved by the apostolic bishops and expressed in the life of the Church through such things as the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Liturgy\"&gt;Divine Liturgy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20mysteries\"&gt;Holy Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; (Eucharist, baptism, marriage, etc.), the &lt;a href=\"Nicene-Constantinopolitan%20Creed\"&gt;Creed&lt;/a&gt; and other doctrinal definitions of the &lt;a href=\"First%20seven%20ecumenical%20councils\"&gt;First seven ecumenical councils&lt;/a&gt;, canonical &lt;a href=\"Christian%20iconography\"&gt;Christian iconography&lt;/a&gt;, and the sanctified lives of godly men and women.\nFor the Orthodox Christian, there is one Tradition, the Tradition of the Church, incorporating the Scriptures and the teaching of the Fathers. As explained by &lt;a href=\"Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Athanasius of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, \"Let us look at the very tradition, teaching, and faith of the catholic Church from the very beginning, which the Logos gave (edoken), the Apostles preached (ekeryxan), and the Fathers preserved (ephylaxan). Upon this the Church is founded (tethemeliotai)\"(St. Athanasius, \"First Letter to Serapion\", 28) \nSacred tradition for the Eastern Orthodox is the deposit of faith given by &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20Apostles\"&gt;apostles&lt;/a&gt; and passed on in the Church from one generation to the next without addition, alteration, or subtraction. &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lossky\"&gt;Vladimir Lossky&lt;/a&gt; described tradition as \"the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church.\" It is dynamic in application yet unchanging in &lt;a href=\"dogma\"&gt;dogma&lt;/a&gt;. It is growing in expression yet is always the same in essence. Rather, Orthodox believe tradition is that faith once delivered as understood within the context of lived history. Tradition is a gift of the Holy Spirit, a living experience, which is relived and renewed through time. Fr. &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Florovsky\"&gt;Georges Florovsky&lt;/a&gt; wrote\"Tradition is not a principle striving to restore the past, using the past as a criterion for the present. Such a conception of tradition is rejected by history itself and by the consciousness of the Orthodox Church. Tradition is the constant abiding of the Spirit and not only the memory of words. Tradition is a charismatic, not a historical event\". (Florovsky, Georges. \"The Catholicity of the Church\" in \"Bible, Church, Tradition\", p. 47)\nCatholic Church.\nThose in the Catholic faith believe that the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20in%20Christianity\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;Apostles&lt;/a&gt; were preserved in the &lt;a href=\"scriptures\"&gt;scriptures&lt;/a&gt; as well as by &lt;a href=\"word%20of%20mouth\"&gt;word of mouth&lt;/a&gt;. This perpetual handing on of the &lt;a href=\"tradition\"&gt;tradition&lt;/a&gt; is called the \"Living Tradition\"; it is believed to be the faithful and constant transmission of the teachings of the Apostles from one generation to the next. That \"includes everything which contributes towards the sanctity of life and increase in faith of the People of God; and so the Church, in her teaching, life and worship [the Creeds, the Sacraments, the Magisterium, and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass], perpetuates and hands on to all generations all that she herself is, all that she believes.\" The &lt;a href=\"Deposit%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Deposit of Faith&lt;/a&gt; () refers to the entirety of &lt;a href=\"revelation\"&gt;divine revelation&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20theology\"&gt;Roman Catholic theology&lt;/a&gt;, two sources of revelation constitute a single \"Deposit of Faith\", meaning that the entirety of divine revelation and the Deposit of Faith is transmitted to successive generations in scripture and sacred tradition (through the teaching authority and interpretation of the Church's &lt;a href=\"Magisterium\"&gt;Magisterium&lt;/a&gt; (which consists of the Church's bishops, in union with the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt;, typically proceeding synods and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20ecumenical%20councils\"&gt;ecumenical councils&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Catholic Church views tradition in much the same terms, as a passing down of that same apostolic faith, but, in a critical difference from the Eastern Orthodox position, Catholicism holds that the faith once delivered, the understanding of it continues to deepen and mature over time through the action of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Spirit\"&gt;Holy Spirit&lt;/a&gt; in the history of the Church and in the understanding of that faith by Christians, all the while staying identical in essence and substance.\nIn the area of moral theology, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20D.%20Jordan\"&gt;Mark D. Jordan&lt;/a&gt; said that medieval texts appeared to be inconsistent. According to &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Cappelli\"&gt;Giovanni Cappelli&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the sixth century, the Church's teachings on morality were incoherent. According to John T. Noonan, \"history cannot leave a principle or a teaching untouched; every application to a situation affects our understanding of the principle itself.\"\n\"Dei Verbum\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;Second Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt; taught on tradition, scripture, and magisterium in \"&lt;a href=\"Dei%20verbum\"&gt;Dei verbum&lt;/a&gt;\", n. 10:\nThus, all of the teachings of the Catholic Church come from either Tradition or Scripture, or from the magisterium interpreting Tradition and Scripture. These two sources, Tradition and Scripture, are viewed and treated as one source of Divine Revelation, which includes both the deeds of God and the words of God:\nThe &lt;a href=\"magisterium\"&gt;magisterium&lt;/a&gt; has a role in deciding authoritatively which truths are a part of sacred tradition.\nLutheranism and Reformed Christianity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reformed\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; traditions of Christianity claim that the Bible alone is the source for Christian doctrine. This position does not deny that Jesus or the apostles preached in person, that their stories and teachings were transmitted orally during the early Christian era, or that truth exists outside of the Bible. For \"&lt;a href=\"sola%20scriptura\"&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/a&gt;\" Christians today, however, these teachings are preserved in the Bible as the only inspired medium. Since in the opinion of \"sola scriptura\" Christians, other forms of tradition do not exist in a fixed form that remains constant in its transmission from one generation to the next and cannot be referenced or cited in its pure form, there is no way to verify which parts of the \"tradition\" are authentic and which are not.\nAnglicanism and Methodism.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Prima%20scriptura\"&gt;Prima scriptura&lt;/a&gt;\" is upheld by the &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; traditions of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, which suggest that Scripture is the primary source for Christian doctrine, but that \"tradition, experience, and reason\" can nurture the Christian religion as long as they are in harmony with the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Anglican Church does accept apostolic tradition, which can be found in the writings of the early Church Fathers, the decrees of the seven Ecumenical Councils, the Creeds, and the liturgical worship of the Church."
