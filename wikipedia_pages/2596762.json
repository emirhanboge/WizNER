Owned by Carolina Christian Broadcasting (also known as Dove Broadcasting), it is a &lt;a href=\"sister%20station\"&gt;sister station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hendersonville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Hendersonville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;-licensed &lt;a href=\"low-power%20broadcasting%23Television\"&gt;low-powered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"GEB%20America\"&gt;GEB America&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"network%20affiliate\"&gt;affiliate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WDKT-LD\"&gt;WDKT-LD&lt;/a&gt; (channel 31). Both stations share studios on Rutherford Road in &lt;a href=\"Taylors%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Taylors, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, while WGGS-TV's transmitter is located at &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Mountain%20State%20Park\"&gt;Paris Mountain State Park&lt;/a&gt; (just outside Greenville).\nHistory.\nThe station first signed on the air on October 29, 1972. It is the oldest independent station in the state of South Carolina, and was also the first new commercial station to sign on in the Greenville\u2013&lt;a href=\"Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Spartanburg&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Asheville&lt;/a&gt; market since &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WSPA-TV\"&gt;WSPA-TV&lt;/a&gt; (channel 7) signed on in April 1956. Carolina Christian Broadcasting has owned the station for its entire existence.\nThe station initially ran a mixture of &lt;a href=\"secularity\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; general entertainment programming for half the broadcast day (which over the years had mainly featured classic series such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lone%20Ranger%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Ozzie%20and%20Harriet\"&gt;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Brady%20Bunch\"&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dennis%20the%20Menace%20%281959%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Dennis the Menace&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Donna%20Reed%20Show\"&gt;The Donna Reed Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Leave%20It%20to%20Beaver\"&gt;Leave It to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20Knows%20Best\"&gt;Father Knows Best&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Rawhide%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Rawhide&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Little%20Rascals\"&gt;Little Rascals&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Looney%20Tunes\"&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Merrie%20Melodies\"&gt;Merrie Melodies&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Popeye\"&gt;Popeye&lt;/a&gt;\" shorts) and Christian-related religious programming for the other half. It aired a larger amount of secular programming on Saturdays, and exclusively carried religious programs on Sundays. The station's programming policy, then as now, was very &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; in regards to content so as not to offend the sensibilities of its mostly &lt;a href=\"Christian%20fundamentalism\"&gt;fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pentecostal\"&gt;Pentecostal&lt;/a&gt; viewership.\nWGGS came under fire for allegedly using a copyrighted name for one of its locally produced programs after &lt;a href=\"ABC%20News\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; premiered the newsmagazine \"&lt;a href=\"Nightline\"&gt;Nightline&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1980; this was despite the fact that the program used the title \"Niteline\" long before \"Nightline\"s existence. Some of WGGS' other local productions at the time included the exercise program \"Beverly Exercise\"; a talk show hosted by Peggy Denny and the &lt;a href=\"children%27s%20television%20series\"&gt;children's program&lt;/a&gt; \"Drick's Follies\" (running during the 1980s and 1990s), which featured &lt;a href=\"public%20domain\"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"animated%20cartoon\"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; shorts from the 1930s to the 1950s.\nIn the early 1980s, Carolina Christian Broadcasting signed on two more stations: WCCT (now &lt;a href=\"WACH\"&gt;WACH&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and WGSE (now &lt;a href=\"WFXB\"&gt;WFXB&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Myrtle%20Beach%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Myrtle Beach&lt;/a&gt;. WCCT produced its own version of \"Niteline\" once a week, and aired WGGS' version during the rest of the week. WCCT and WGSE aired far more cartoons, barter &lt;a href=\"talk%20show\"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"game%20show\"&gt;game show&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"sitcom\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt;s than WGGS did, with Christian programming comprising only about a third of the schedules of both. Both stations were later sold off to secular interests (both WACH and WFXB are now affiliates of &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;; WACH is now owned by the &lt;a href=\"Sinclair%20Broadcast%20Group\"&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt; and WFXB is now owned by &lt;a href=\"Bahakel%20Communications\"&gt;Bahakel Communications&lt;/a&gt;).\nWGGS was the only independent station in the western Carolinas until the winter of 1979, when WAIM-TV (channel 40, now &lt;a href=\"MyNetworkTV\"&gt;MyNetworkTV&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WMYA-TV\"&gt;WMYA-TV&lt;/a&gt;) lost its secondary ABC affiliation and reformatted itself as independent station WAXA. WGGS began to phase out secular programs from its lineup in 1982, a process that sped up when &lt;a href=\"WHNS\"&gt;WHNS&lt;/a&gt; (channel 21, now a Fox affiliate) signed on in April 1984. By 1986, the station almost entirely ran Christian-oriented religious programs. WGGS did acquire some additional secular cartoons and barter sitcoms to air during the late afternoons from 3:00 to 6:00\u00a0p.m. in the early 1990s, but by 1999, the station was back to airing a schedule almost entirely made up of religious programming. The station also turned down an offer by &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Media\"&gt;Paxson Communications&lt;/a&gt; to affiliate with &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Television\"&gt;Pax TV&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. The station originally signed off on a nightly basis until the early 1990s, when it reduced its off-hours to late Sunday night/early Monday mornings; channel 16 began broadcasting on a 24-hour schedule in late 1999.\nEven after the digital television transition, WGGS' transmitter only provides &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20range\"&gt;grade B&lt;/a&gt; signal coverage to the North Carolina portion of the market. From the late 1970s until 1984, WGGS operated a &lt;a href=\"low-power%20broadcasting%23Television\"&gt;low-power&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20relay%20station%23translator%20station\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt; in Asheville on UHF channel 21. This was necessary in the days before there was significant &lt;a href=\"cable%20television\"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt; penetration in the Greenville\u2013Spartanburg\u2013Asheville market. When this translator was displaced by WHNS when it signed on in 1984, WGGS reached a deal with the owners of WASV-TV (channel 62, now &lt;a href=\"WYCW\"&gt;WYCW&lt;/a&gt;) in Asheville, to operate it as a full-power &lt;a href=\"Broadcast%20relay%20station%23Satellite%20stations\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; until it was sold in 1995 to former WHNS owner &lt;a href=\"Pappas%20Telecasting%20Companies\"&gt;Pappas Telecasting Companies&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 13, 2017, the FCC announced that WGGS participated in the 2016\u201317 &lt;a href=\"spectrum%20reallocation\"&gt;spectrum reallocation&lt;/a&gt; auction and will be compensated $44.3 million to move its signal to the Low-VHF band. On September 6, 2019, WGGS transitioned from channel 16 to channel 2.\nProgramming.\nThe station's schedule almost entirely consists of Christian programming. WGGS airs many shows hosted by &lt;a href=\"televangelism\"&gt;televangelists&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bakker\"&gt;Jim Bakker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Hinn\"&gt;Benny Hinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Copeland\"&gt;Kenneth Copeland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Robison%20%28televangelist%29\"&gt;James Robison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joyce%20Meyer\"&gt;Joyce Meyer&lt;/a&gt; as well as shows such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20700%20Club\"&gt;The 700 Club&lt;/a&gt;\", \"In Touch with &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Charles%20Stanley\"&gt;Dr. Charles Stanley&lt;/a&gt;\" and some locally produced programming such as the local Christian talk/variety show \"Niteline\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tammy%20Faye%20Messner\"&gt;Tammy Faye Messner&lt;/a&gt;, the ex-wife of former &lt;a href=\"The%20PTL%20Club\"&gt;PTL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20USA\"&gt;Heritage USA&lt;/a&gt; founder Jim Bakker, announced plans for a cooking show called \"You Can Make It!\" which began airing in May 2006 (Messner died of &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in July 2007, but the show remains in production with a different host). The few secular programs on the station include &lt;a href=\"infomercial\"&gt;infomercial&lt;/a&gt;s, wildlife sporting programs, family-oriented public domain television series (such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cisco%20Kid%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Cisco Kid&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Scaly Adventures\", and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\"), and home improvement, health and fitness programs (such as \"&lt;a href=\"P.%20Allen%20Smith\"&gt;P. Allen Smith&lt;/a&gt; Garden Style\"). The station also airs some Christian-oriented children's programming as well as a few programs (such as \"Praise the Lord\") sourced from the &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Broadcasting%20Network\"&gt;Trinity Broadcasting Network&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which does not have a full-time affiliate nor an &lt;a href=\"owned-and-operated%20station\"&gt;owned-and-operated station&lt;/a&gt; in the Greenville\u2013Spartanburg\u2013Asheville market (however, the network's national feed is carried on &lt;a href=\"Charter%20Spectrum\"&gt;Charter Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; and select other cable providers). Like many religious independents of its format, WGGS does not carry secular programming on Sundays, opting to air bible instruction programs, church services and televangelist programs.\nTechnical information.\nSubchannels.\nThe station's digital signal is &lt;a href=\"multiplex%20%28TV%29\"&gt;multiplexed&lt;/a&gt;:\nAnalog-to-digital conversion.\nWGGS-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20high%20frequency\"&gt;UHF&lt;/a&gt; channel 16, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States &lt;a href=\"Digital%20television%20transition%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 35 to channel 16.\nOut-of-market cable carriage.\nIn recent years, WGGS has been carried on cable in areas outside of the Upstate &lt;a href=\"media%20market\"&gt;media market&lt;/a&gt;, including within the Columbia market in South Carolina, the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; market in North Carolina and the &lt;a href=\"Augusta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Augusta&lt;/a&gt; market in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;."
