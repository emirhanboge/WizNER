    "text": "The Thames Torso Murders, often called the Thames Mysteries or the Embankment Murders, was a series of unsolved murders which occurred in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England from 1887 to 1889. The series included four incidents which were filed as belonging to the same series. None of the cases were solved, and only one of the four victims was identified. In addition, other murders of a similar kind, taking place between 1873 and 1902, have also been associated with the same murder series. \nSpeculations have linked the Thames murder series to that of the contemporary &lt;a href=\"Whitechapel%20murders\"&gt;Whitechapel murders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20the%20Ripper\"&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. However, the \"&lt;a href=\"modus%20operandi\"&gt;modus operandi&lt;/a&gt;\" of the perpetrator of the Thames Torso Murders differs from the Ripper in that the victims of Jack the Ripper suffered progressive abdominal- and genital-area &lt;a href=\"mutilation\"&gt;mutilation&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Thames Torso Murderer &lt;a href=\"Dismemberment\"&gt;dismembered&lt;/a&gt; the bodies of his victims.\nThe canonical four.\nThe series included four incidents which were filed as belonging to the same series. These cases were the Rainham Mystery, the Whitehall Mystery, the murder of Elizabeth Jackson, and the Pinchin Street Torso Murder. \nRainham Mystery.\nBetween May and June 1887, the remains of a woman's body were found in the River Thames near &lt;a href=\"Rainham%2C%20London\"&gt;Rainham&lt;/a&gt;. Workers first encountered a bundle with the torso of a female. Throughout May and June, various parts of the same body were found, with the exception of the head and upper chest.\nThe investigation concluded that the body had not been dissected for medical purpose, but that a degree of medical knowledge had been necessary to perform the dissection. Because the doctors could not state a cause of death, the jury was forced to return a verdict of \"Found Dead\".\nWhitehall Mystery.\nBetween 11 September and 17 October 1888, the dismembered remains of a woman were discovered at three different sites in the centre of the city, including the future site of &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20Yard\"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt;, the police's headquarters. The torso was matched by police surgeon &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29\"&gt;Thomas Bond&lt;/a&gt; to a right arm and shoulder that had previously been discovered on the muddy shore of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pimlico\"&gt;Pimlico&lt;/a&gt; on 11 September. \"The Times\" newspaper had initially suspected that the arm was placed in the water as a medical students' prank. On 17 October 1888, reporter Jasper Waring used a &lt;a href=\"Spitsbergen\"&gt;Spitsbergen&lt;/a&gt; dog, with the permission of the police and the help of a labourer, to find a left leg cut above the knee that was buried near the construction site.\nElizabeth Jackson.\nOn 4 June 1889 a female torso was found in the Thames, and more body parts were soon found in the Thames the next week.\nThe London \"Times\" reported on 11 June that the remains found so far \"are as follows: Tuesday, left leg and thigh off &lt;a href=\"Battersea\"&gt;Battersea&lt;/a&gt;, lower part of the abdomen at &lt;a href=\"Horsleydown\"&gt;Horsleydown&lt;/a&gt;; Thursday, the liver near &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Elms\"&gt;Nine Elms&lt;/a&gt;, upper part of the body in &lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Park\"&gt;Battersea Park&lt;/a&gt;, neck and shoulders off Battersea; Friday, right foot and part of leg at &lt;a href=\"Wandsworth\"&gt;Wandsworth&lt;/a&gt;, left leg and foot at &lt;a href=\"Limehouse\"&gt;Limehouse&lt;/a&gt;; Saturday, left arm and hand at &lt;a href=\"Bankside\"&gt;Bankside&lt;/a&gt;, buttocks and pelvis off Battersea, right thigh at &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20Embankment\"&gt;Chelsea Embankment&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday, right arm and hand at Bankside.\"\nThe investigation concluded that medical knowledge had been necessary to perform the dismemberment. At the inquest held by &lt;a href=\"Athelstan%20Braxton%20Hicks\"&gt;Mr Braxton Hicks&lt;/a&gt; on 17 June it was stated that: \"the division of the parts showed skill and design: not, however, the anatomical skill of a surgeon, but the practical knowledge of a butcher or a &lt;a href=\"knacker\"&gt;knacker&lt;/a&gt;. There was a great similarity between the condition, as regarded cutting up, of the remains and that of those found at Rainham, and at the new police building on the Thames Embankment.\" The London \"Times\" of 5 June reported that \"in the opinion of the doctors the women had been dead only 48 hours, and the body had been dissected somewhat roughly by a person who must have had some knowledge of the joints of the human body.\"\nShe was about eight months pregnant. The doctors were also this time unable to establish a cause of death. The jury, however, reached the decision of \"Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\".\nThough the head was never found, the victim was identified as Elizabeth Jackson, a homeless prostitute from Chelsea.\nPinchin Street Torso Murder.\nOn 10 September 1889 Police Constable William Pennett found the headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman under a railway arch at &lt;a href=\"Whitechapel%20murders%23Pinchin%20Street%20torso\"&gt;Pinchin Street&lt;/a&gt;, Whitechapel. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dispersed for disposal.\nA woman's torso was found at 5:15\u00a0a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel. Extensive bruising about the victim's back, hip, and arm indicated that she had been severely beaten shortly before her death, which had occurred approximately one day prior to the discovery of her torso. The victim's abdomen was also extensively mutilated in a manner reminiscent of the Ripper, although her genitals had not been wounded. The dismembered sections of the body are believed to have been transported to the railway arch, hidden under an old chemise. The age of the victim was estimated at 30\u201340 years. Despite a search of the area, no other sections of her body were ever found, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified.\n&lt;a href=\"Donald%20Swanson\"&gt;Chief Inspector Swanson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Monro\"&gt;Commissioner Monro&lt;/a&gt; noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat. The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death. Newspaper speculation that the body belonged to Lydia Hart, who had disappeared, was refuted after she was found recovering in hospital after \"a bit of a spree\". Another claim that the victim was a missing girl called Emily Barker was also refuted, as the torso was from an older and taller woman.\nSwanson did not consider this a Ripper case, and instead suggested a link to the Thames Torso Murders in &lt;a href=\"Rainham%2C%20London\"&gt;Rainham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%2C%20London\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the \"&lt;a href=\"Whitehall%20Mystery\"&gt;Whitehall Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\". Monro agreed with Swanson's assessment. These three murders and the Pinchin Street case are suggested to be the work of a serial killer, nicknamed the \"Torso killer\", who could either be the same person as \"Jack the Ripper\" or a separate killer of uncertain connection. Links between these and three further murders\u2014the \"&lt;a href=\"Battersea%20Mystery\"&gt;Battersea Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1873 and 1874, in which two women were found dismembered, and the 1884 \"&lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Court%20Road%20Mystery\"&gt;Tottenham Court Road Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014have also been postulated. Experts on the murders\u2014colloquially known as \"Ripperologists\"\u2014such as Stewart Evans, &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Skinner\"&gt;Keith Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Fido\"&gt;Martin Fido&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Rumbelow\"&gt;Donald Rumbelow&lt;/a&gt;, discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings on the basis of their different \"&lt;a href=\"modi%20operandi\"&gt;modi operandi&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMonro was replaced as Commissioner by Sir &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edward%20Bradford%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;Edward Bradford&lt;/a&gt; on 21 June 1890, after a disagreement with the Home Secretary &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Matthews%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Llandaff\"&gt;Henry Matthews&lt;/a&gt; over police pensions.\nAssociated cases.\nOutside the four canonical cases which were filed by the police as belonging to the same series, there were additional cases which have been linked to the Thames Torso Murders. \nBattersea Mystery.\nThe Battersea Mystery is the name given to two &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20unsolved%20deaths\"&gt;unsolved murders&lt;/a&gt; that took place in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 1873\u201374.\nOn 5 September 1873, the left quarter of a woman's trunk was discovered by a Thames Police patrol near &lt;a href=\"Battersea\"&gt;Battersea&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, a right breast was found at &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Elms\"&gt;Nine Elms&lt;/a&gt;, a head at &lt;a href=\"Limehouse\"&gt;Limehouse&lt;/a&gt;, a left forearm at Battersea, a pelvis at &lt;a href=\"Woolwich\"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/a&gt;, until an almost complete body of a dismembered woman had been found. The nose and the chin had been cut from the face, and the head had been scalped.\nUnder the leadership of the Acting Chief Surgeon, Metropolitan Police, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29\"&gt;Thomas Bond&lt;/a&gt;, the corpse was reconstructed. The attempts to identify the remains were disturbed by the curiosity of the public, and the police first showed a photograph to any potential witness.\nThe Lancet reported: \nThe jury passed a verdict of \"Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\". The case remained unsolved, in spite of a \u00a3200 reward being offered for information.\nIn June 1874, the dismembered body of a female was discovered in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Putney\"&gt;Putney&lt;/a&gt;. The corpse lacked head, both arms and one leg, and had been treated with lime before being thrown in the river. The jury returned an open verdict. The case remained unsolved.\nTottenham Court Road and Bedford Square Mystery.\nThe Tottenham Court Road Mystery was reported by the Times on 24 October 1884, relating to the discovery of parts of a woman's body:\nNear Tottenham Court Road, in Bedford Square, a woman's arm was found in a parcel. This arm had been tattooed, showing that it might have belonged to a prostitute.\nA human torso was found in a parcel by a police constable as he passed &lt;a href=\"33%20Fitzroy%20Square\"&gt;33 Fitzroy Square&lt;/a&gt; five days later. The parcel was believed to have been placed at the location between the hours of 10:00 and 10:15.\nEvidence was presented in an inquest on 11 November, held at St Giles Coroner's Court. This concluded that the body parts came from a woman and that they might have been divided by someone who was skilled, but not for the purpose of anatomy.\nThe inquest resumed on 9 December. More evidence was presented and showed how it was skilfully dissected and came from a woman, as stated by Dr Jenkins. This evidence was the right arm and the right and left foot, along with the right forearm of a single individual.\nThese two mysteries still remain unsolved.\nLe mystere de Montrouge and Lambeth Mystery.\nIn his 2002 book \"The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London\", R. Michael Gordon suggests there may be a link to a murder in Paris in 1886, as well as to another murder in London in 1902. \nIn November 1886, a woman's torso was found on the steps of the Montrouge church in Paris, missing the head, legs, right arm, left breast and uterus. \nIn June 1902 a woman's torso was found in Salamanca Alley in &lt;a href=\"Lambeth\"&gt;Lambeth&lt;/a&gt; in London. \nNo suspect was identified in either case.\nSpeculation.\nNewspapers suggested a tie to &lt;a href=\"Jack%20the%20Ripper\"&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;'s killings of prostitutes that were occurring simultaneously, but the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police\"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; said there was no connection. It is debatable whether Jack the Ripper and the \"Torso killer\" were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area. The \"modus operandi\" of the Torso killer differed from that of the Ripper, and police at the time discounted any connection between the two. "
