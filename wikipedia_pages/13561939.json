The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.

For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $18,529 for the program. Courses are offered in cooperation with &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Beaver\"&gt;Pennsylvania State University Beaver Campus&lt;/a&gt;.\nGraduation requirements.\nThe Rochester Area School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 27.5 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in math 4 credits, English 4 credits, social studies 3 credits, science 4 credits, Physical Education 1 credit, Health 0.5 credit, Arts and Humanities 2 credits, Computers/Business 3 credits, Senior project 1 credit and electives 5 credits.\nBy law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school.

The courses are weighted in regards to GPA and school ranking. The fee for each AP Exam is $91 (2014). The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students have the option of taking &lt;a href=\"College%20Board\"&gt;College Board&lt;/a&gt; approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges.

Since both schools use the ram as a mascot, the annual football game is known as the \"Battle of the Rams\".\nThe school is known as the home to &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; track star &lt;a href=\"Lauryn%20Williams\"&gt;Lauryn Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who set many school and state records in track.\nThe school also won the 1983 PIAA Class AA Men's Basketball Championship.\nBattle of the Bridge.\nThe football team played in one of the most notable rivalries in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Western Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; high school football with rival &lt;a href=\"Monaca%20High%20School\"&gt;Monaca High School&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Monaca%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Monaca&lt;/a&gt; just across the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt;. The two schools played in the annual Battle of the Bridge, in which the winner had their name listed first on the &lt;a href=\"Rochester-Monaca%20Bridge\"&gt;Rochester-Monaca Bridge&lt;/a&gt; for a year. The rivalry was so well known that it was featured at the &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20History%20Center%23Western%20Pennsylvania%20Sports%20Museum%20at%20the%20History%20Center\"&gt;Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rivalry also led to the two schools meeting in the playoffs on several occasions. In 1998 and 2000, both schools met at &lt;a href=\"Three%20Rivers%20Stadium\"&gt;Three Rivers Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to determine the WPIAL champion, with Rochester winning both times. When the two teams did meet in the postseason, the Rochester-Monaca Bridge was not on the line, as that year's results were already determined.\nOn occasion, the football rivalry would spill into other sports. In 2001, the two schools met in Rochester for the first of two men's &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; matchups for the season between the two schools. Near the end of the game, a fight erupted in the stands, with several people arrested. To prevent another incident for the second game at Monaca, only school administrators were allowed at that game, as fans, cheerleaders, and even parents of the athletes were not allowed at the game. Fans were allowed at future games after that season.\nWith the merger of the Monaca School District and &lt;a href=\"Center%20Area%20School%20District\"&gt;Center Area School District&lt;/a&gt;s into the new &lt;a href=\"Central%20Valley%20School%20District\"&gt;Central Valley School District&lt;/a&gt;, the year 2009 marked the final season that &lt;a href=\"Monaca%20High%20School\"&gt;Monaca High School&lt;/a&gt; existed. Consequently, 2009 was the last season in with a \"Battle of the Bridge\" game. This contest took place on Saturday, October 31, 2009 and the Rams won 28-0. The game was given national attention by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20American%20Rivalry%20Series\"&gt;Great American Rivalry Series&lt;/a&gt;, with Rochester Stadium reportedly having a &lt;a href=\"standing-room%20only\"&gt;standing-room only&lt;/a&gt; attendance of 11,000 fans witnessing the final game of a great rivalry. Since the end of the 2009-2010 school year, the permanent name of the bridge is \"Rochester-Monaca\" on the Rochester side and \"Monaca-Rochester\" on the Monaca side."
