    "text": "Pascal was a &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; built in the 1890s, the second and final member of the . The \"Descartes\"-class cruisers were ordered as part of a construction program directed at strengthening the fleet's cruiser force. At the time, France was concerned with the growing naval threat of the Italian and German fleets, and the new cruisers were intended to serve with the main fleet, and overseas in the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. \"Pascal\" was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20164%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;, was protected by an armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, and was capable of steaming at a top speed of .\n\"Pascal\" had a fairly short and uneventful career; after entering service in 1897, she was sent to &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt;, where she served for the next seven years. During this period, she was part of the French squadron that responded to the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Uprising\"&gt;Boxer Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Qing%20China\"&gt;Qing China&lt;/a&gt;. In poor condition by 1904, she saw little further use and was struck from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; in 1911, thereafter being &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nIn response to a war scare with Italy in the late 1880s, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; embarked on a major construction program in 1890 to counter the threat of the Italian fleet and that of Italy's ally Germany. The plan called for a total of seventy cruisers for use in home waters and overseas in the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Descartes\" &lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised and \"Pascal\", was ordered to as part of the program.\n\"Pascal\" was &lt;a href=\"long%20between%20perpendiculars\"&gt;long between perpendiculars&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; . Her crew varied over the course of her career, and consisted of 383\u2013401\u00a0officers and enlisted men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of &lt;a href=\"triple-expansion%20steam%20engine\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s driving two &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. Steam was provided by sixteen coal-burning &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20boiler\"&gt;Belleville-type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s that were ducted into two &lt;a href=\"funnel%20%28ship%29\"&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt;. Her machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at and at 19.5\u00a0knots.\nThe ship was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20164%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201893\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;. They were placed in individual &lt;a href=\"sponson\"&gt;sponson&lt;/a&gt;s clustered &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;, two guns per &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;. These were supported by a &lt;a href=\"battleship%20secondary%20armament\"&gt;secondary battery&lt;/a&gt; of ten &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%20100%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201891\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;, which were carried in sponsons, &lt;a href=\"casemate\"&gt;casemate&lt;/a&gt;s, and individual &lt;a href=\"pivot%20mount\"&gt;pivot mount&lt;/a&gt;s. For close-range defense against &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, she carried fourteen &lt;a href=\"QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;3-pounder Hotchkiss guns&lt;/a&gt; and eight &lt;a href=\"QF%201-pounder%20pom-pom\"&gt;1-pounder guns&lt;/a&gt;. She was also armed with two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in her &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;. Armor protection consisted of a curved &lt;a href=\"armor%20deck\"&gt;armor deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, along with plating on the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nService history.\nWork on \"Pascal\" began with her &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;keel laying&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Toulon\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt; in December 1893. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 1895 and was &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; to begin &lt;a href=\"sea%20trials\"&gt;sea trials&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. During her initial testing, she was found to suffer from stability problems and had to receive additional &lt;a href=\"ballast\"&gt;ballast&lt;/a&gt; to correct the problem. Work on the ship was completed in 1897. With the beginning of the unrest that led to the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Uprising\"&gt;Boxer Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Qing%20China\"&gt;Qing China&lt;/a&gt; in 1898, many European colonial powers began to reinforce their naval forces in East Asia. \"Pascal\" was sent to the region in January 1898 to reinforce the French squadron there, which at that time also included the old &lt;a href=\"ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclad&lt;/a&gt; , the protected cruisers \"Descartes\" and , and the &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; .\n\"Pascal\" remained in East Asian waters in 1899, along with \"Descartes\" and \"Duguay-Trouin\", though \"Jean Bart\" was recalled home. After the uprising broke out in China late that year, the French considerably strengthened the squadron in the Far East; by January 1901, they had assembled a force of nine cruisers, including \"Pascal\". She remained in East Asian waters in 1902, but with fighting over in China, the unit began to be reduced in size. By 1903, the unit consisted of the &lt;a href=\"armored%20cruiser\"&gt;armored cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the protected cruisers and , in addition to \"Pascal\". \"Pascal\" continued to operate in &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; in 1904, but she was in poor condition by that time and was unable to steam faster than . She saw little further service, in part because of her deteriorated state, but also because by this time, the French Navy had settled on building a fleet of armored cruisers to fulfill the roles that the \"Descartes\" class had been intended to fill. \"Pascal\" was struck from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; in 1911 and &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; for scrap."
