    "text": "Duty is the third studio album by Japanese recording artist &lt;a href=\"Ayumi%20Hamasaki\"&gt;Ayumi Hamasaki&lt;/a&gt;. It was released on September 27, 2000 by &lt;a href=\"Avex%20Trax\"&gt;Avex Trax&lt;/a&gt;. \"Duty\" is Hamasaki's first studio album inside the &lt;a href=\"2000s%20in%20music\"&gt;2000 decade&lt;/a&gt;, and her third consecutive studio album to be fully produced by Japanese musician and businessman &lt;a href=\"Max%20Matsuura\"&gt;Max Matsuura&lt;/a&gt;. The album's composing and arrangement was handled by several music collaborators, such as Ken Harada, &lt;a href=\"Kazuhito%20Kikuchi\"&gt;Kazuhito Kikuchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dai%20Nagao\"&gt;Dai Nagao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hal%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;H\u039bL&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Hamasaki contributed to the album as the primary and background vocalist, and songwriter to every song. Three different formats were released to promote the album: a standalone CD, a limited edition Playbutton, and a digital download. The cover sleeve has Hamasaki wearing a leopard-print &lt;a href=\"cat%20suit\"&gt;cat suit&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the album's release, it was met with favorable reviews from music critics. Critics highlight individual songs as stand out tracks, and found the album a memorable effort within the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20pop%20music\"&gt;Japanese pop&lt;/a&gt; genre. \"Duty\" became Hamasaki's third studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's &lt;a href=\"Oricon%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;Oricon Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt;. The album has sold over three million units in Japan, making it her best selling studio album as well as the sixth highest selling Japanese album of the 2000 decade. Five singles were released from the album. Two of the singles, \"&lt;a href=\"Seasons%20%28Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20song%29\"&gt;Seasons&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Surreal%20%28song%29\"&gt;Surreal&lt;/a&gt;\", topped Japan's &lt;a href=\"Oricon%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Oricon Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;, while the former sold over 1.3 million units in Japan. Hamasaki promoted the album through her 2000 &lt;a href=\"Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20Concert%20Tour%202000%20Vol.%202\"&gt;self-titled concert tour&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground and composition.\n\"Duty\" is Hamasaki's first studio album inside the &lt;a href=\"2000s%20in%20music\"&gt;2000 decade&lt;/a&gt;, and her third consecutive studio album to be fully produced by Japanese musician and businessman &lt;a href=\"Max%20Matsuura\"&gt;Max Matsuura&lt;/a&gt;. For the album, Hamasaki's record label &lt;a href=\"Avex%20Trax\"&gt;Avex Trax&lt;/a&gt; hired several Japanese musicians, Ken Harada, &lt;a href=\"Kazuhito%20Kikuchi\"&gt;Kazuhito Kikuchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dai%20Nagao\"&gt;Dai Nagao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hal%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;H\u039bL&lt;/a&gt;, among many others to work on the album. Those producers are just some of whom worked with Hamasaki on her second studio album, the predecessor \"&lt;a href=\"Loveppears\"&gt;Loveppears&lt;/a&gt;\" (1999). \"Duty\" is also Hamasaki's third consecutive album to be composed, arranged, and produced by Japanese producers and composers. For the album, she contributed as the main and background vocalist, and became her third studio album to feature songs written by her. Three songs on the album; the trilogy set \"&lt;a href=\"Vogue%20%28Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20song%29\"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Far%20Away%20%28Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20song%29\"&gt;Far Away&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Seasons%20%28Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20song%29\"&gt;Seasons&lt;/a&gt;\", focus on the theme of hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image. Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for the album involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the song writing was done as \"unnatural\" and was constantly \"nervous\" for the finished result.\nThe album is a &lt;a href=\"J-pop\"&gt;J-pop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; album with numerous musical elements of &lt;a href=\"Latin%20pop\"&gt;Latin pop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;. According to Takako Tsuriya from \"Cawaii\" magazine, much of the musical style was \"darker\" than \"Loveppears\". Likewise, the magazine labelled it a \"rock\"-influenced album with only one dance song, \"&lt;a href=\"Audience%20%28Ayumi%20Hamasaki%20song%29\"&gt;Audience&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Audience\" is also Hamasaki's second self-written song to incorporate an English word. The album opens with the &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;-influenced \"Starting Over\", which is an instrumental track. \"Vogue\" was influenced by the musical element of Latin pop.\n\"Vogue\", alongside \"Far Away\", and \"Seasons\" are all written about three different time frames; \"Vogue\" discusses Hamasaki's presence, \"Far Away\" details her past, and \"Seasons\" talks about her future. The title track, \"Scar\", \"End of the World\", and \"Surreal\" were referenced as \"dark\" rock songs with \"mad[ness]\" lyrics. \"Teddy Bear\" is a &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;-only ballad track that discusses Hamasaki's &lt;a href=\"nostalgia\"&gt;nostalgia&lt;/a&gt;. \"Key (Eternal Key)\" is a midtempo pop rock song with several guitar riffs. The album's closer is \"Girlish\", a \"warm\" pop rock song.\nRelease and packaging.\n\"Duty\" was released on September 27, 2000 by &lt;a href=\"Avex%20Trax\"&gt;Avex Trax&lt;/a&gt; in three different formats. It was also released on the same day as her single \"Surreal\". The stand-alone &lt;a href=\"CD\"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; featured the twelve tracks in a &lt;a href=\"jewel%20case\"&gt;jewel case&lt;/a&gt;, with first press editions including an &lt;a href=\"Obi%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;obi&lt;/a&gt;. A limited edition Playbutton, which is a headphone-insert device, featured the twelve tracks. The final format is the &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital release&lt;/a&gt;, which was released in Japan at the time. In September 2008, the album, alongside several other albums and singles released by her, were released digitally on &lt;a href=\"iTunes%20Store\"&gt;iTunes Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amazon.com\"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;. The album artwork was photographed by Toru Kumazawa, and features Hamasaki in a leopard-print cat-suit. She is standing in between two elastic poles, similar to a &lt;a href=\"cage%20%28enclosure%29\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt; or jail cell. The art direction and designing was handled by Shinichi Hara and Shigeru Kasai from RICE, and leopard print was printed throughout the booklet. An out take of the album cover was used as the cover sleeve for the &lt;a href=\"CD%20single\"&gt;CD single&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"VHS\"&gt;VHS&lt;/a&gt; release of \"Surreal\".\nCritical response.\n\"Duty\" received positive reviews from most music critics. A staff reviewer from \"CD Journal\" was positive in their review. In comparison to Hamasaki's second album, \"Loveppears\", the reviewer praised her application of \"poetic\" lyrics and clearer vocals. At the Annual 2001 &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Gold%20Disc%20Awards\"&gt;Japan Gold Disc Awards&lt;/a&gt;, Hamasaki won Domestic Artist of the Year, \"Duty\" was awarded Pop Album of the Year and the single \"Seasons\" was awarded Song of the Year.\nIn 2020, Jonathan McNamara of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Japan%20Times\"&gt;The Japan Times&lt;/a&gt;\" listed \"Duty\" as one of the 10 Japanese albums worthy of inclusion on \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\"'s 2020 list of the &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;500 greatest albums of all time&lt;/a&gt;, describing it as \"an essential album for anyone seeking to comprehend the ever-evolving landscape of Japanese pop music.\"\nCommercial performance.\nIn Japan, \"Duty\" debuted at number the top spot on the &lt;a href=\"Oricon%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;Oricon Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; with over 1.6 million units sold in its first week of sales. This became Hamasaki's highest first week sales for an album, until it was surpassed by her 2001 &lt;a href=\"greatest%20hits\"&gt;greatest hits&lt;/a&gt; compilation \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Best\"&gt;A Best&lt;/a&gt;\" with 2.874 million units in its first week of sales. \"Duty\" stayed at number one for a second week, with 339,810 units sold in its second week of sales.
