    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Robichon de La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re (1688\u20131751) was a French riding master who had a profound effect on accepted methods for &lt;a href=\"horse%20training\"&gt;horse training&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the most influential writers on the art of &lt;a href=\"dressage\"&gt;dressage&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDe La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re was born on 8 May 1688 at &lt;a href=\"Essay%2C%20Orne\"&gt;Essay&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Alen%C3%A7on\"&gt;Alen\u00e7on&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, France. He spent most of his early years in Normandy. Although his brother Pierre des Brosses de La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re directed the Acad\u00e9mie d'\u00e9quitation in &lt;a href=\"Caen\"&gt;Caen&lt;/a&gt;, originally established in 1594 by another French master, &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20de%20Pluvinel\"&gt;Antoine de Pluvinel&lt;/a&gt;, de La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re's most influential instructor was de Vendeuil.\nIn 1715, de La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re received his diploma as an , and he began as a director of an equestrian academy in Paris, a position which he held for 15 years and which earned him a reputation as an instructor and rider. This led to an appointment by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20%C3%A9cuyer%20de%20France\"&gt;Grand \u00e9cuyer de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Charles%20of%20Lorraine\"&gt;Prince Charles of Lorraine&lt;/a&gt;, as Directeur du Man\u00e8ge des Tuileries in 1730. He held the position of Equerry to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; until his death in 1751.\nRiding theories.\nDe La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re is credited for the invention of the &lt;a href=\"shoulder-in\"&gt;shoulder-in&lt;/a&gt;, which he called the \"alpha and omega of all exercises\"; he was the first to describe it. His treatise \"L'\u00c9cole de Cavalerie\", \"The School of Horsemanship\", which was published in parts between 1729 and 1731, and as a complete work in 1733, is an important book on the training of the horse, detailing equitation, veterinary treatment, and general horsemanship. This book has become an important text for the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Riding%20School\"&gt;Spanish Riding School&lt;/a&gt; of Vienna.\nDe La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re gave exercises to increase suppleness and balance of the horse, and a progressive schooling system to reach an overall goal: a light, obedient, calm horse that was a pleasure to ride. De La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re is also credited with the invention of the &lt;a href=\"flying%20change\"&gt;flying change&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"counter-canter\"&gt;counter-canter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his book, \"Ecole de Cavallerie\" (Paris, 1733), de La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re stresses the use of few &lt;a href=\"riding%20aids\"&gt;aids&lt;/a&gt; and punishments while riding. He advises the use of the shoulder-in at all &lt;a href=\"horse%20gait\"&gt;gaits&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"gallop\"&gt;gallop&lt;/a&gt;. De La Gu\u00e9rini\u00e8re states the rider must also have a good seat in order to have a soft, light hand, and makes several references to &lt;a href=\"William%20Cavendish%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle\"&gt;William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;."
