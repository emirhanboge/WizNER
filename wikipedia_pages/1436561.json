    "text": "\"I Will Survive\" is a song by American singer &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Gaynor\"&gt;Gloria Gaynor&lt;/a&gt;, released in October 1978 as the second single from her sixth album, \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Tracks%20%28Gloria%20Gaynor%20album%29\"&gt;Love Tracks&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978). It was written by &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Perren\"&gt;Freddie Perren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Fekaris\"&gt;Dino Fekaris&lt;/a&gt;. A top-selling song, it is a popular &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; anthem, as well as being certified &lt;a href=\"RIAA%20certification\"&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (RIAA).\nThe song's lyrics describe the narrator's discovery of personal strength following an initially devastating breakup. It received heavy airplay in 1979, spending three non-consecutive weeks at number one on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; as well as topping the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Irish Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. The song is also frequently recalled as a symbol of female empowerment. In 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; deemed Gaynor's original recording to be \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Recording%20Registry\"&gt;National Recording Registry&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposition and recording.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Fekaris\"&gt;Dino Fekaris&lt;/a&gt;, the principal writer of the song, \"I Will Survive\" has its genesis in his experience getting fired by &lt;a href=\"Motown%20Records\"&gt;Motown Records&lt;/a&gt; in mid-1970s after seven years working there as a staff writer. Jobless, he turned on the TV in his room, and a theme song he had written for the film \"&lt;a href=\"Generation%20%28film%29\"&gt;Generation&lt;/a&gt;\" (performed by &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Earth%20%28band%29\"&gt;Rare Earth&lt;/a&gt;) happened to be playing. He took it as a good omen, and jumped up and down on the bed saying, \"I'm going to make it. I'm going to be a songwriter. I will survive!\". Fekaris teamed up with with his collaborator &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Perren\"&gt;Freddie Perren&lt;/a&gt;, another former member of the Motown production team, to write the song; however, the song remained unrecorded for two years as no suitable singer was available.\nIn 1978, Perrin was asked by Polydor to produce \"&lt;a href=\"Substitute%20%28The%20Righteous%20Brothers%20song%29\"&gt;Subsitute&lt;/a&gt;\" for Gloria Gaynor, which he agreed on the understanding that he could also produce the B side. When Gaynor was asked what kind of songs she liked, she said she liked \"songs that are meaningful, have good lyrics, and touch people's hearts.\" The producers then handed her the song lyrics of \"I Will Survive\" scribbled on a piece of brown paper. Gaynor recognised the song as a hit immediately.\nAccording to Robert \"Boogie\" Bowles who played guitar on the song, in the three-hour recording session, the session musicians spent most of their time recording the A side, \"Substitute\". As a result, they only had 35 minutes to record the B side. They also did not even know the song title or the melody of the song, but they were fairly relaxed recording it in the belief that the B side would likely not be played. Based only on the chord changes and a few notes, they improvised freely much of the backing track, and Bowles filled in the bare bone of the tune with jazzy blues licks. Due to the difference in the intro from the main body of the tune which made a smooth transition difficult, it was recorded in two parts and then spliced together. Gaynor then recorded the vocals, doing it while wearing a back brace after having to undergo surgery due to fall at a concert. The injury and a recent bereavement made Gaynor identified with the sentiment of \"I Will Survive\"; she said: \"That's why I was able to sing the song with so much conviction\".\nReleases.\nAlthough Gaynor was convinced that \"I Will Survive\" would be a hit and tried to persuade the label to release it as the A side, the label refused to entertain the idea and it was released as the B-side to \"Substitute\". Gaynor's husband took the song to the &lt;a href=\"Studio%2054\"&gt;Studio 54&lt;/a&gt; DJ &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Kaczor\"&gt;Richie Kaczor&lt;/a&gt;, who loved the song and played the song. She also gave the DJ a stack of the records to give to his friends. Other &lt;a href=\"disc%20jockey\"&gt;disc jockey&lt;/a&gt;s in discos and radio stations soon followed and played that side of the record instead. The popularity of \"I Will Survive\" with the DJs led to the label releasing the song as an A side. To support the single, a video shot at &lt;a href=\"Xenon%20%28nightclub%29\"&gt;Xenon Discotheque&lt;/a&gt; in New York was released. It featured a &lt;a href=\"roller%20skater\"&gt;roller skater&lt;/a&gt; Sheila Reid-Pender from a local group called The Village Wizards &lt;a href=\"Artistic%20roller%20skating\"&gt;skate dancing&lt;/a&gt; on the dance floor. \nThe original A side \"Substitute\" appeared on the \"Billboard\" &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Soul%20Singles\"&gt;Hot Soul Singles&lt;/a&gt; chart for four weeks starting October 14, 1978, peaking at No. 78. It also appeared on the \"Billboard\" &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Under%20the%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Bubbling Under the Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart for four weeks in October\u2013November 1978, peaking at No. 107. \"I Will Survive\" on the other hand performed significantly better; it entered the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; in December that year and reached No. 1 on the chart in March 1979. The song received the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Disco%20Recording\"&gt;Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, the only year the award was given.\nRemixes.\nFollowing the success of fellow 1970s disco stars &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Sledge\"&gt;Sister Sledge&lt;/a&gt; with remixed singles in the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, \"I Will Survive\" was also remixed and released that summer. This remix reached number five on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; and number three on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Dance Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. It also peaked at number six in Ireland and number nine in Portugal. In 1999, a remix of the song charted in France, peaking at number 23. And in 2000, another remix reached number six in Spain. In November 2013, Gaynor released a gospel album entitled \"We Will Survive\", which includes a new, updated remix of \"I Will Survive\" by DJ Shpank in both extended and &lt;a href=\"radio%20edit\"&gt;radio edit&lt;/a&gt; formats. In 2018, a remix again charted in France, peaking at number 12.\nMusic video.\nA promotional video was filmed in 1979 at the New York discoth\u00e8que called Xenon. Sheila Reid-Pender of Harlem is the featured skater in the video from the skating group, The Village Wizards. Although three videos were filmed that day, the \"I Will Survive\" video was the only one to survive. Gaynor was not present during the taping of the rollerskating segment of the video. Gaynor and Pender met for the first time on July 7, 2014 in New York at the 92nd St. YMCA after Gaynor's lecture and promotional signing of her book 'We Will Survive'. In this book, Gaynor said, \"I wanted everybody\u2014including myself\u2014to believe that we could survive\".\nImpact and legacy.\n&lt;a href=\"VH1\"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt; ranked \"I Will Survive\" number one in their list of \"100 Greatest Dance Songs\" in 2000.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked it number 492 in their \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2004.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" placed it at number 97 in their ranking of \"The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs\" in 2008.\nIn 2012, \"I Will Survive\" was ranked number two in \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" poll of \"The Best Disco Songs of All Time\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked it number 48 in their \"The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list in November 2016.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the song number seven in their \"The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics\" list in 2017.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" featured it in their list of \"50 Songs That Define the Last 50 Years of LGBTQ+ Pride\" in 2018. They added,\n\"'I Will Survive' probably would've become a gay anthem even without the specter of AIDS. It has an undeniable flair for the dramatic: After moving through that filigreed piano intro, you can imagine a lone spotlight shining on Gloria Gaynor as she drags the man dumb enough to break her heart and crawl back for more. It was released as disco's wave was beginning to break, topping the Billboard charts a few months before the infamous &lt;a href=\"Disco%20Demolition%20Night\"&gt;Disco Demolition Night&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Comiskey%20Park\"&gt;Comiskey Park&lt;/a&gt;. Had the story ended there, it'd represent the last, best gasp of a culture beaten into temporary irrelevance by thinly-veiled racism and homophobia.\"\nIn 1998, the French football (soccer) team made \"I Will Survive\" their unofficial anthem, particularly focusing on the instrumental sub-theme. The team ended up winning the World Cup and the song enjoyed immense popular enthusiasm amongst younger generations in the country 20 years after its original release.\nOfficial versions.\nRecorded by Gloria Gaynor\nCake version.\nAmerican rock band &lt;a href=\"Cake%20%28band%29\"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; covered \"I Will Survive\" in a &lt;a href=\"soft%20rock\"&gt;soft rock&lt;/a&gt;-style in 1996, on their second album, \"&lt;a href=\"Fashion%20Nugget\"&gt;Fashion Nugget&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996). In addition to many subtle changes, lead singer &lt;a href=\"John%20McCrea%20%28musician%29\"&gt;John McCrea&lt;/a&gt; altered the lyrics. In an interview, Gaynor stated she did not like Cake's version of the song because it used \"profanity\" (McCrea changed the phrase \"I should've changed that stupid lock\" to \"...that fucking lock\").\nThe &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; of Cake's version features McCrea as a city &lt;a href=\"parking%20enforcement%20officer\"&gt;parking enforcement officer&lt;/a&gt; driving around in a &lt;a href=\"Cushman%20%28company%29\"&gt;Cushman&lt;/a&gt; three-wheeled scooter as he leaves tickets on various cars. Their version peaked at number 28 on the US \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Rock%20Tracks\"&gt;Modern Rock Tracks&lt;/a&gt; chart in March 1997.\nChantay Savage version.\nAmerican singer &lt;a href=\"Chantay%20Savage\"&gt;Chantay Savage&lt;/a&gt; covered \"I Will Survive\" in 1996 as a &lt;a href=\"ballad\"&gt;ballad&lt;/a&gt;. It was released as the first single from her second album, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Will%20Survive%20%28Doin%27%20It%20My%20Way%29\"&gt;I Will Survive (Doin' It My Way)&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996). This version peaked at number 24 on the US &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;, and was certified Gold by the &lt;a href=\"Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (RIAA).\nCritical reception.\nGerald Martinez from \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Sunday%20Times\"&gt;New Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"Chantay has a fabulous voice, with a great range and rich, chocolatey tone, in the &lt;a href=\"Anita%20Baker\"&gt;Anita Baker&lt;/a&gt; mould. She performs the old hit, I Will Survive, at a slower sexier pace than the original, making it a very different statement than the rousing anthemic style of the original. This is a more personal, more vulnerable version. Nice track indeed.\"\nDiana Ross version.\nAmerican singer &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Ross\"&gt;Diana Ross&lt;/a&gt; released a cover of \"I Will Survive\" in 1996. It was released on April 14, as the fourth and final single from her twenty-first album, \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Me%20Higher\"&gt;Take Me Higher&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995). The song is produced by &lt;a href=\"Narada%20Michael%20Walden\"&gt;Narada Michael Walden&lt;/a&gt; and peaked at number 14 in the United Kingdom. It also reached number three in Iceland and number 16 in Scotland. In the United States, it peaked at number 37 on the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Play\"&gt;Hot Dance Club Play&lt;/a&gt; chart.\nCritical reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"The kicker is a delicious cover of &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Gaynor\"&gt;Gloria Gaynor&lt;/a&gt;'s \"I Will Survive\", produced by &lt;a href=\"Narada%20Michael%20Walden\"&gt;Narada Michael Walden&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, that is the number that stands out in the legendary artist's current (and oh-so-festive) -hour show.\" The Daily Vault's Mark Millan commented that it is \"dealt with superbly, as the team managed to breathe new life into an old relic from the distant, dark days when &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; ruled.\" Alan Jones from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that \"the combination of two old favourites is bound to win favour with many people, and new dance mixes by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Sanchez\"&gt;Roger Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; will ease the track's path to success now it is a single.\" James Hamilton from the magazine's \"RM\" Dance Update noted the \"galloping good &lt;a href=\"Hi-NRG\"&gt;Hi-NRG&lt;/a&gt; 0-134bpm &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Rodway\"&gt;Motiv 8&lt;/a&gt; Club Vocal and Hell Razor Dub\".

In 1998 and 2018, their version reached number one on the French hitlist after the win from the &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;French Team&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeah McFall version.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Voice%20UK\"&gt;The Voice UK&lt;/a&gt; contestant, &lt;a href=\"Leah%20McFall\"&gt;Leah McFall&lt;/a&gt;, performed the song on the first live show in the style of &lt;a href=\"Chantay%20Savage\"&gt;Chantay Savage&lt;/a&gt;. Following the programme, the studio recording of the performance was released and reached number three on UK &lt;a href=\"iTunes\"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.
