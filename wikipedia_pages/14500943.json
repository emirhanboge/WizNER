    "text": "The Fayetteville Force was a professional &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team. based in &lt;a href=\"Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Fayetteville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. The franchise was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;Central Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (1997\u20132001). They played their home games at the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crown Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn 1996 the Central Hockey League (CHL) decided to expand eastward, adding privately owned teams for the first time. &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Coffey\"&gt;Bill Coffey&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;East Coast Hockey League&lt;/a&gt;, applied for a franchise in &lt;a href=\"Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Fayetteville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Fear%20%28region%29\"&gt;Cape Fear region&lt;/a&gt; had a population of close to a quarter of a million people and was the home of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Bragg%20%28North%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest military posts in the world.\nOn June 17, 1997 it was announced that Fayetteville would become a member of the CHL. The team was named the \"Force\" in honor of the military base and would play its home games at the new &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20County%20Crown%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crown Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn its first season the team was a financial success, drawing an average of almost 4,000 spectators a game during the 1997-98 season. The triumph of the first year relied upon more than just the northern-raised servicemen and other such transplants who were hockey fans. The novelty of the new Crown Coliseum was a draw in the first year, as were &lt;a href=\"Fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;hockey fights&lt;/a&gt; and \u201czany\u201d promotions such as a between-periods contest of shooting the puck at empty beer cartons placed along the goal line - hitting a carton meant that the shooter would take home a full case of &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two years, Coffey sold the club. The new ownership group lacked knowledge of the business of &lt;a href=\"minor%20league\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; sports, and the travel to places as distant as &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, became increasingly more expensive. Additionally, the honeymoon between the local residents and the new sport and its arena was over.\nThe brightest moment of the Force\u2019s last two seasons occurred on January 25, 2000, when the Coliseum hosted the CHL &lt;a href=\"all-star%20game\"&gt;all-star game&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that eight inches of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; had fallen during the day, 6,128 people showed to watch the game.\nIn the spring of 2001 it was announced that the CHL would &lt;a href=\"Consolidation%20%28business%29\"&gt;consolidate&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Professional%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;Western Professional Hockey League&lt;/a&gt;. With the departures of teams in Columbus, Huntsville and Macon, the Force became isolated and it was determined to be financially impossible to continue in the CHL, so they folded.\nThere would be no more professional hockey in Fayetteville until the 2002-03 season when the ACHL and the &lt;a href=\"Fayetteville%20FireAntz\"&gt;Fayetteville FireAntz&lt;/a&gt; would come to town."
