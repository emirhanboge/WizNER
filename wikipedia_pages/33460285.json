    "text": "Natamata (a &lt;a href=\"Bislama\"&gt;Bislama&lt;/a&gt; name derived from vernacular words such as &lt;a href=\"Raga%20language\"&gt;Raga&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"East%20Ambae%20language\"&gt;East Ambae&lt;/a&gt; \"tamata\" and &lt;a href=\"Apma%20language\"&gt;Apma&lt;/a&gt; \"temwat\") is a concept underlying the social fabric of traditional communities in north-eastern &lt;a href=\"Vanuatu\"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt;. The concept has no exact equivalent in Western culture and law. It is sometimes translated as \"peace\", though \"harmony\" is probably a closer translation. The concept encompasses social and spiritual harmony, and the set of unwritten customary laws by which this harmony is maintained.\nMaintaining \"natamata\" is the responsibility of customary chiefs. It is believed that when a transgression is committed by a member of the community, \"natamata\" is broken, and must be restored, usually by the paying of fines to the chief and to the person who was wronged.\nReferences to \"natamata\" are common in personal names and place names, such as the &lt;a href=\"Penama\"&gt;Penama&lt;/a&gt; Provincial Centre of \"Saratamata\" on Ambae, whose name translates roughly as \"Field of Harmony\"."
