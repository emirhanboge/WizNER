    "text": "Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) is an &lt;a href=\"acute%20%28medical%29\"&gt;acute&lt;/a&gt; liver infection in dogs caused by Canine mastadenovirus A, formerly called \"Canine adenovirus 1\" (CAV-1). CAV-1 also causes disease in &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coyote\"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"encephalitis\"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es. The &lt;a href=\"virus\"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; is spread in the feces, urine, blood, saliva, and nasal discharge of infected dogs. It is contracted through the mouth or nose, where it replicates in the &lt;a href=\"tonsil\"&gt;tonsil&lt;/a&gt;s. The virus then infects the &lt;a href=\"liver\"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kidney\"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"incubation%20period\"&gt;incubation period&lt;/a&gt; is 4 to 7 days.\nSymptoms include &lt;a href=\"fever\"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, depression, loss of appetite, coughing, and a tender abdomen. &lt;a href=\"Cornea\"&gt;Cornea&lt;/a&gt;l &lt;a href=\"edema\"&gt;edema&lt;/a&gt; and signs of liver disease, such as &lt;a href=\"jaundice\"&gt;jaundice&lt;/a&gt;, vomiting, and &lt;a href=\"hepatic%20encephalopathy\"&gt;hepatic encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, may also occur. Severe cases will develop &lt;a href=\"coagulation\"&gt;bleeding&lt;/a&gt; disorders, which can cause &lt;a href=\"hematoma\"&gt;hematoma&lt;/a&gt;s to form in the mouth. Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease. However, most dogs recover after a brief illness, although chronic corneal edema and kidney lesions may persist.\nDiagnosis is made by recognizing the combination of symptoms and abnormal blood tests that occur in infectious canine hepatitis. A rising &lt;a href=\"serology\"&gt;antibody titer&lt;/a&gt; to CAV-1 is also seen. The disease can be confused with &lt;a href=\"canine%20parvovirus\"&gt;canine parvovirus&lt;/a&gt; because both will cause a low &lt;a href=\"white%20blood%20cell\"&gt;white blood cell&lt;/a&gt; count and bloody diarrhea in young, unvaccinated dogs.\nTreatment is symptomatic. Most dogs recover spontaneously without treatment. Prevention is through &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"ATCvet\"&gt;ATCvet&lt;/a&gt; code and various combination vaccines). Most combination &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;s for dogs contain a modified canine adenovirus type-2. CAV-2 is one of the causes of respiratory infections in dogs, but it is similar enough to CAV-1 that vaccine for one creates &lt;a href=\"immunity%20%28medical%29\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; for both. CAV-2 vaccine is much less likely to cause side effects than CAV-1 vaccine. One study has shown the vaccine to have a duration of immunity of at least four years.\nCAV-1 is destroyed in the environment by steam cleaning and &lt;a href=\"quaternary%20ammonium%20cation\"&gt;quaternary ammonium compound&lt;/a&gt;s. Otherwise, the virus can survive in the environment for months in the right conditions. It can also be released in the urine of a recovered dog for up to a year."
