    "text": "The 2021 UEFA Europa League Final was the final match of the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, the 50th season of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s secondary club &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tournament organised by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;, and the 12th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. It was played on 26 May 2021 at the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stadion Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, Poland, between Spanish club &lt;a href=\"Villarreal%20CF\"&gt;Villarreal&lt;/a&gt; and English club &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final was originally scheduled to be played at the &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n%20Stadium\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;, Spain. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2020 final&lt;/a&gt; to Cologne, the final hosts were shifted back a year, with Gda\u0144sk instead hosting the 2021 final, as a result of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Europe\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nVillarreal won the match 11\u201310 on penalties following a 1\u20131 draw after &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;, thus winning its first trophy in the competition. As winners, Villarreal earned the right to play against the winners of the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;2021 UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They also qualified for the group stage of the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2021\u201322 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 2009 were in the UEFA Cup era, since 2010 were in the UEFA Europa League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe match was played at the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stadion Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, Poland. At the meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Kyiv in May 2018, the stadium was initially selected to host the &lt;a href=\"2020%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2020 UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt;, but when the COVID-19 pandemic forced UEFA to move the latter stages of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2019\u201320 competition&lt;/a&gt; to Germany, the UEFA Executive Committee delayed Stadion Gda\u0144sk's hosting of the Europa League final to 2021. The original venues for the 2021 and &lt;a href=\"2022%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2022 finals&lt;/a&gt; were also delayed by a year. \nThis was the first UEFA club match hosted at the stadium, which was one of the venues for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It was the second UEFA club competition final to be played in Poland, as the &lt;a href=\"2015%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2015 UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt; was played at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Stadium%2C%20Warsaw\"&gt;National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. When the stadium was selected to host the 2020 final, it was known as Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk, so due to UEFA sponsorship regulations, marketing materials for the match referred to the venue as Gda\u0144sk Stadium. Although the sponsorship deal with Energa was ended in November 2020, the stadium continued to be known as Gda\u0144sk Stadium for the final.\nHost selection.\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 September 2017 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2020. Associations had until 31 October 2017 to express interest, and bid dossiers had to be submitted by 1 March 2018. Associations hosting matches at &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020&lt;/a&gt; were not allowed to bid for the 2020 UEFA Europa League final.\nUEFA announced on 3 November 2017 that two associations had expressed interest in hosting the 2020 UEFA Europa League final.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stadion Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; in Gda\u0144sk was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; on 24 May 2018.\nOn 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2020 final&lt;/a&gt;, Gda\u0144sk would instead host the 2021 final.\nBackground.\nThis was Villarreal's fourth ever final in an official &lt;a href=\"Tournament%23Knockout%20tournaments\"&gt;knockout tournament&lt;/a&gt;, having played previously three in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20competitions\"&gt;UEFA competitions&lt;/a&gt;, all in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;, winning it in &lt;a href=\"2003%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2004%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, this was head coach &lt;a href=\"Unai%20Emery\"&gt;Unai Emery&lt;/a&gt;'s fifth European final, all in the UEFA Europa League; he won three successive titles with &lt;a href=\"Sevilla%20FC\"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2014%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2015%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2016%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, before losing in &lt;a href=\"2019%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis was Manchester United's second UEFA Cup/Europa League final, having won the only previous occasion in &lt;a href=\"2017%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, it was their eighth European major final between the European Cup/Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and the UEFA Cup/Europa League. &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r\"&gt;Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; reached his first final as the club's manager, having scored the winning goal in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;1999 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; playing for them, exactly 22 years prior.\nThe clubs previously met four times, in the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20D\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20E\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; UEFA Champions League group stages.
