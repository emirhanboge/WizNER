Kirkpatrick, and commissioned on 20 May 1944, &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; A. H. Holtz in command.\nWorld War II.\n\"Baya\" arrived at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in August 1944. During 23 August 1944 \u2013 25 July 1945 she completed five war patrols in the &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20Sea\"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Siam\"&gt;Gulf of Siam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Sea\"&gt;Java Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Sea\"&gt;Philippine Sea&lt;/a&gt;. \"Baya\" sank four Japanese vessels totaling 8855\u00a0tons and an 8407-ton passenger-cargo ship in conjunction with .\n\"Baya\" departed &lt;a href=\"Subic%20Bay\"&gt;Subic Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Islands\"&gt;Philippine Islands&lt;/a&gt;, in September 1945 and arrived at &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on 24 September. Shortly thereafter she began inactivation and on 14 May 1946 went out of commission in reserve at &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Naval%20Shipyard\"&gt;Mare Island Naval Shipyard&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Baya\" received four &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt;s for her &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; service.\nResearch submarine.\n\"Baya\" was recommissioned 10 February 1948 and converted to an electronics experimental submarine. Reclassified Auxiliary Research Submarine, AGSS-318, 12 August 1949, \"Baya\" conducted experiments for the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Electronics%20Laboratory\"&gt;Naval Electronics Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%2C%20California\"&gt;San Diego, Calif.&lt;/a&gt;, participated in local operations near San Diego and served with the joint American-Canadian Task Force gathering scientific data off western &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in November and December 1948. During July\u2013September 1949 she made a cruise to the &lt;a href=\"Arctic\"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt; to gather valuable scientific data in the &lt;a href=\"Bering%20Sea\"&gt;Bering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chukchi%20Sea\"&gt;Chukchi Sea&lt;/a&gt;s. Between July and October 1955 she was deployed to Pearl Harbor on further experimental research.\n\"Baya\" was used as a &lt;a href=\"testbed\"&gt;testbed&lt;/a&gt; for two early &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"transducer\"&gt;transducer&lt;/a&gt; arrays which markedly changed her appearance. The first arrangement of 196 transducers in a 14\u00d714 array was attached to the former gun mount abaft the conning tower, facing starboard and surrounded by a fairwater resembling a second conning tower.\nAfter the first array and fairwater were removed, \"Baya\" was completely reworked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard during 1958 and 1959 to test the second array, called &lt;a href=\"LORAD\"&gt;LORAD&lt;/a&gt; (for LOng RAnge Detection). The forward &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s were removed and replaced by a blunt bow containing the forward-facing transducer array. A &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20anchor\"&gt;mushroom anchor&lt;/a&gt; was installed in the bottom of the hull; and a section was added between the former forward torpedo room and the forward battery compartment, with quarters for twelve scientists. These modifications increased her overall length to , and her submerged displacement to approximately 2,600\u00a0tons. Her maximum speed was reduced to .&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.subnet.com/FLEET/ss318.htm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Baya\" was decommissioned and struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Register\"&gt;Naval Register&lt;/a&gt;, 30 October 1972, and sold for scrapping, 12 October 1973."
