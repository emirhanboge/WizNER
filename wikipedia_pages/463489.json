They kept the same name until they joined the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Superliga\"&gt;Albania National Championship&lt;/a&gt; as one of the original six members alongside &lt;a href=\"KF%20Tirana\"&gt;SK Tiran\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%ABnderbeu%20Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB\"&gt;Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bashkimi%20Shkodran\"&gt;Bashkimi Shkodran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KF%20Elbasani\"&gt;Urani Elbasan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flamurtari%20Vlor%C3%AB\"&gt;Sportklub Vlor\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. In 1930, before entering the National Championship, the club changes its name to the \"Klubi Sportiv Teuta Durr\u00ebs\", in reference to Queen &lt;a href=\"Teuta%20of%20Illyria\"&gt;Teuta of Illyria&lt;/a&gt;. In the first National Championship they finished fifth out of six teams, collecting three wins and two draws out of ten games. The following season they finished as runners-up in the league, as they lost 4\u20131 in the championship final against SK Tiran\u00eb, where the club's goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Dovana\"&gt;Niko Dovana&lt;/a&gt; famously scored the equaliser in the first leg which ended in a 1\u20131 draw.\nAfter Communism took control of Albania the club was forced to change its name to \"KS Ylli i Kuq Durr\u00ebs\", literally meaning &lt;a href=\"KS%20Teuta%20Durr%C3%ABs\"&gt;KS Red Star Durr\u00ebs&lt;/a&gt;. Just 3 years later in 1950 the club dropped KS Red Star Durr\u00ebs from its name and was simply called SK Durr\u00ebs once again, before renaming to \"&lt;a href=\"KS%20Teuta%20Durr%C3%ABs\"&gt;SK Puna Durr\u00ebs&lt;/a&gt;\" a 1-year later in 1951. The club changed its name again in 1958 to \"KS Lokomotiva Durr\u00ebs\" which they kept until the fall of Communism in Albania in 1991. Since 1991 the club has renamed KS Teuta Durr\u00ebs, with the football team being called KF Teuta.\nHasanbelliu era.\nIn 1999 local businessman and owner of Eurotech Cement Edmond Hasanbelliu he was named as the new president of the club, he brought in &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20Lika\"&gt;Hasan Lika&lt;/a&gt; as manager immediately. He began investing in the club and introduced Albanian internationals &lt;a href=\"Sokol%20Prenga\"&gt;Sokol Prenga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suad%20Li%C3%A7i\"&gt;Suad Li\u00e7i&lt;/a&gt; in the club, alongside a host of other players including &lt;a href=\"Orges%20Shehi\"&gt;Orges Shehi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arjan%20Sheta\"&gt;Arjan Sheta&lt;/a&gt;. In the club's first season under Hasan Lika and Edmond Hasanbelliu they finished in third place, behind &lt;a href=\"Tomori%20Berat\"&gt;Tomori Berat&lt;/a&gt; and eventual winners &lt;a href=\"KF%20Tirana\"&gt;KF Tirana&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a successful &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Cup\"&gt;Albanian Cup&lt;/a&gt; run as they eliminated &lt;a href=\"Flamurtari%20Vlor%C3%AB\"&gt;Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KF%20Tirana\"&gt;KF Tirana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dinamo%20Tirana\"&gt;Dinamo Tirana&lt;/a&gt; to reach the final against &lt;a href=\"KS%20Lushnja\"&gt;KS Lushnja&lt;/a&gt;, which ended 0\u20130 after extra time and Teuta won the game 5\u20134 on penalties. They qualified for the second qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the following season, where they faced Austrian side &lt;a href=\"SK%20Rapid%20Wien\"&gt;SK Rapid Wien&lt;/a&gt;. They were eliminated following a 6\u20130 aggregate loss, after 4\u20130 and 2\u20130 losses.\nRecent years.\nIn November 2013 the president Hasanbelliu announced that the club had sold a 50% stake to &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; company Gea Sport, who promised investment in the club in order to achieve domestic success as well as have good runs in Europe. The firm's first action as shareholders was to replace the Albanian coach &lt;a href=\"Gugash%20Magani\"&gt;Gugash Magani&lt;/a&gt; with the Italian &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Sorrentino\"&gt;Roberto Sorrentino&lt;/a&gt;, who became the club's first ever foreign coach. Following less than 2 months as shareholders Gea Sport were instrumental in bringing in 11 players during the January transfer window, most of which were foreigners, in an attempt to push for the title. on 24 February 2014, Sorrentino was fired as the first team coach following a string of poor results. The club announced the appointment of Ilir Daja the day after Sorrentino's departure.\nStadium.\nThe club play their home games at the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Dovana%20Stadium\"&gt;Niko Dovana Stadium&lt;/a&gt; which was built in 1965 and currently has a capacity of around 13,000.
