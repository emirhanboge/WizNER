    "text": "Trond Erik Bertelsen (born 5 June 1984 in &lt;a href=\"Sandnes\"&gt;Sandnes&lt;/a&gt;) is a retired &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who currently works for &lt;a href=\"Sandnes%20Ulf\"&gt;Sandnes Ulf&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is originally from &lt;a href=\"Sandnes\"&gt;Sandnes&lt;/a&gt; where he played for &lt;a href=\"Lura%20IL\"&gt;Lura IL&lt;/a&gt;. The fast paced left back has 32 &lt;a href=\"Norway%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;U21&lt;/a&gt;-international caps and 30 caps as a younger national team player. Bertelsen came to &lt;a href=\"Fredrikstad%20FK\"&gt;Fredrikstad FK&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"FK%20Haugesund\"&gt;FK Haugesund&lt;/a&gt; during the winter of 2004, and was one of the first signings of coach &lt;a href=\"Egil%20Olsen\"&gt;Egil \u00abDrillo\u00bb Olsen&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2006 he made his full international debut for the &lt;a href=\"Norway%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway national football team&lt;/a&gt;, and has received a total of three caps (23 September 2007). In 2006 he made four appearances in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;Norwegian Football Cup&lt;/a&gt;, including an assist in the 3-0 quarter-final win against &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A5lerenga%20Fotball\"&gt;V\u00e5lerenga Fotball&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Fredrikstad%20FK\"&gt;Fredrikstad FK&lt;/a&gt; won the cup for the 11th time in the clubs history. Bertelsen also had a trial with &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; back in 2001, as a 17-year-old.\nBertelsen was linked to &lt;a href=\"Viking%20FK\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; during the summer of 2007, as he was meant to replace the position as left back for the ageing &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Pereira%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Thomas Pereira&lt;/a&gt;. Bertelsen expressed happiness over the possibility of returning to &lt;a href=\"Rogaland\"&gt;Rogaland&lt;/a&gt; to play for Viking. Viking though cancelled the transfer as a result of the knee injury that had plagued him, and worries over his possibilities of returning to top level football. Eventually Bertelsen and the two clubs came to an agreement and a contract was signed with the &lt;a href=\"Stavanger\"&gt;Stavanger&lt;/a&gt; club."
