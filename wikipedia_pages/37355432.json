    "text": "Fagan (; ), also known by &lt;a href=\"%23Name\"&gt;other names&lt;/a&gt; including Fugatius, was a legendary 2nd-century Welsh &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Welsh%20saints\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;, said to have been sent by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Rome\"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; to answer &lt;a href=\"King%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLucius\"&gt;King\u00a0Lucius&lt;/a&gt;'s request for baptism and conversion to &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. Together with his companion &lt;a href=\"St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDeruvian\"&gt;St\u00a0Deruvian&lt;/a&gt;, he was sometimes reckoned as the &lt;a href=\"apostle\"&gt;apostle&lt;/a&gt; of Britain.\nKing\u00a0Lucius's letter (in most accounts, to &lt;a href=\"Pope%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BEleutherius\"&gt;Pope\u00a0Eleutherius&lt;/a&gt;) may represent earlier traditions but does not appear in surviving sources before the 6th century; the names of the bishops sent to him does not appear in sources older than the early 12th century, when their story was used to support the independence of the &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20St%20Davids\"&gt;bishops&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"St%20Davids%20Cathedral\"&gt;St\u00a0Davids&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and the antiquity of the &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury\"&gt;Glastonbury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The story became widely known following its appearance in &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Geoffrey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Monmouth\"&gt;Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"pseudohistory\"&gt;pseudohistorical&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Britain\"&gt;History of the Kings of Britain&lt;/a&gt;\". This was influential for centuries and its account of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20saint\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Fagan and Deruvian were used during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt; to support the claims of both the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt;. Geoffrey's account is now considered wholly implausible, but Christianity was well-established in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman Britain&lt;/a&gt; by the third century. Some scholars therefore argue the stories preserve a more modest account of the conversion of a &lt;a href=\"Romano-British%20culture\"&gt;Romano-British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20tribes%20of%20Britain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly by Roman emissaries by these names.\nFagan is the patron saint of a number of churches, and gives his name to the village &lt;a href=\"St%20Fagans\"&gt;St Fagans&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, now the home of a &lt;a href=\"St%20Fagans%20National%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Welsh National History Museum&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"G%C5%B5yl%20Mabsant\"&gt;feast day&lt;/a&gt; does not appear in any medieval Welsh &lt;a href=\"calendar%20of%20the%20saints\"&gt;calendar of the saints&lt;/a&gt; and is not observed by the &lt;a href=\"Church%20in%20Wales\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Thyateira%20and%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; churches in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nSt Fagan's name appears as \"Phagan\" () in &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Malmesbury\"&gt;William of Malmesbury&lt;/a&gt;'s work \"On the Antiquity of the Glastonbury Church\", written between 1129 and 1139. It is given as \"Fagan\" (') in &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"pseudo-history\"&gt;pseudo-historical&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae\"&gt;History of the Kings of Britain&lt;/a&gt;\", written around 1136 and sometimes supposed to have been the source of the name's later insertion into William's account. The name has been variously connected with &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"paganus\" (\"rural, &lt;a href=\"paganism\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; \"faguin\" (\"&lt;a href=\"faggot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;faggoter&lt;/a&gt;, wood gatherer\"), and &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"fagin\" (\"joyful\"). &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wade%20Wade-Evans\"&gt;Wade-Evans&lt;/a&gt; proposed that the name was a confusion with the Italo-British &lt;a href=\"rhetorician\"&gt;rhetorician&lt;/a&gt; Bachan or Pachan\"' who appears in the &lt;a href=\"hagiography\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Cadoc\"&gt;Saint Cadoc&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entry on &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eleutherius\"&gt;Pope Eleutherius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20de%20Natalibus\"&gt;Petrus de Natalibus&lt;/a&gt;'s late 14th-century collection of &lt;a href=\"hagiography\"&gt;saints' lives&lt;/a&gt; gives Fagan's name as \"Fugatius\", an emendation subsequently copied by &lt;a href=\"Bartolomeo%20Platina\"&gt;Platina&lt;/a&gt; and many others. These names were further misspelled in later sources in a variety of ways.\nSources.\nThe story of &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eleutherius\"&gt;Eleutherius&lt;/a&gt;'s late-2nd-century &lt;a href=\"mission%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"apocrypha%23Spurious%20writings\"&gt;apocryphal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Britons\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lucius%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Lucius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; (Welsh: &lt;a href=\"Lles%20ap%20Coel\"&gt;Lles ap Coel&lt;/a&gt;) dates to at least the 6th-century &lt;a href=\"recension\"&gt;recension&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Liber%20Pontificalis\"&gt;The Book of Popes&lt;/a&gt;\" known as the \"Felician Catalog\" but the names of the missionaries themselves don't seem to have appeared before the 12th century. They aren't given by &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt;'s 8th-century \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Ecclesiastica%20Gentis%20Anglorum\"&gt;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&lt;/a&gt;\" or by the 9th-century \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Brittonum\"&gt;History of the Britons&lt;/a&gt;\" traditionally credited to &lt;a href=\"Nennius\"&gt;Nennius&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Malmesbury\"&gt;William of Malmesbury&lt;/a&gt;'s 'third edition' of the \"&lt;a href=\"Gesta%20Regum%20Anglorum\"&gt;Deeds of the Kings of the English&lt;/a&gt;\" () records of the priests sent to Lucius that \"the rust of antiquity may have obliterated their names\".\nHowever, the work \"On the Antiquity of the Glastonbury Church\", initially written by &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Malmesbury\"&gt;William&lt;/a&gt; between 1129 and 1139, and &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae\"&gt;History of the Kings of Britain&lt;/a&gt;\" both include the names of Fagan and his companion. A contemporaneous or even earlier source is the letter of the convent of &lt;a href=\"St%20David%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;St David's&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Honorius%20II\"&gt;Pope Honorius\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt; preserved in &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Gerald of Wales&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Invectionibus\"&gt;Book of Invectives&lt;/a&gt;\" which appears to date from the 1120s. Geoffrey claimed to have derived his own account from a 6th-century treatise by &lt;a href=\"Gildas\"&gt;St\u00a0Gildas&lt;/a&gt; on \"the victory of &lt;a href=\"Aurelius%20Ambrosius\"&gt;Aurelius Ambrosius&lt;/a&gt;\"; given the content of his story, the claim is generally discounted. After these, the story began to be broadly repeated. Further details appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Iolo%20Manuscripts\"&gt;Iolo Manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; collected by &lt;a href=\"Iolo%20Morganwg\"&gt;Edward Williams&lt;/a&gt;, although his many alterations and forgeries render their historicity suspect.\nThe discrepancy in William's accounts led &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Armitage%20Robinson\"&gt;Robinson&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the appearance of the missionaries' names in the earlier book was a spurious addition by the abbey's scribes, of a piece with the passages in the present text that include a patently fraudulent \"Charter of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Patrick\"&gt;St\u00a0Patrick&lt;/a&gt;\", that describe Abbot &lt;a href=\"Henry%20of%20Blois\"&gt;Henry of Blois&lt;/a&gt; (\u00a01171) as \"of blessed memory\", and that mention a fire which occurred at the abbey in 1184. Robinson and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Bartrum\"&gt;Bartrum&lt;/a&gt; proceed to treat Fagan as an invention of Geoffrey subsequently taken up by others. &lt;a href=\"Sabine%20Baring-Gould\"&gt;Baring-Gould&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rice%20Rees\"&gt;Rees&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20J.%20Mullins\"&gt;Mullins&lt;/a&gt; modify this somewhat: while admitting the general falsehood of the account in Geoffrey, they suggest that the \"names\" of Fagan and his companions were probably genuine but that\u2014in the absence of more detailed surviving records\u2014they had been taken up and added to the legendary accounts of King Lucius.\nLegend.\nAccounts of St\u00a0Fagan and his companion &lt;a href=\"Deruvian\"&gt;Deruvian&lt;/a&gt; joined a long-standing narrative concerning &lt;a href=\"Kings%20of%20Britain\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lucius%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Lucius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and his conversion to &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Antoninus%20Pius\"&gt;Antoninus Pius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;, a time of &lt;a href=\"Anti-Christian%20policies%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;general tolerance towards the religion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gildas\"&gt;St\u00a0Gildas&lt;/a&gt; had described the first &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;apostles&lt;/a&gt; as arriving during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tiberius\"&gt;Tiberius&lt;/a&gt;. William of Malmesbury's cautious account in the \"Deeds of the Kings of the English\" allows that &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;St\u00a0Philip&lt;/a&gt; may have reached the island but quickly leaves such \"vain imaginations\" in favor of praising the ancient &lt;a href=\"wattle%20%28construction%29\"&gt;wattle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Chapel%20%28Glastonbury%29\"&gt;chapel of St\u00a0Mary&lt;/a&gt; erected by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eleutherius\"&gt;Pope Eleutherius&lt;/a&gt;'s nameless missionaries, which he called \"the oldest I am acquainted with in England\". (The precise antiquity of the church was part of a bitter dispute over seniority between the abbey and &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; over the primacy of their foundations.)\nThe current text of \"On the Antiquity of the Glastonbury Church\" is rather more florid: Philip is not said to have come himself but to have sent &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20of%20Arimathea\"&gt;Joseph of Arimathea&lt;/a&gt; in precisely AD\u00a063. His initial community died out and the area left to \"wild beasts\" but \"Phagan\" and &lt;a href=\"Deruvian\"&gt;Deruvian&lt;/a&gt; found it miraculously preserved, merely reviving its community in AD\u00a0166, directed by the &lt;a href=\"Archangel%20Gabriel\"&gt;Archangel Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; and joining their names to the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles%20%28genre%29\"&gt;Acts of the Apostles&lt;/a&gt;. They were said to have provided &lt;a href=\"Christian%20pilgrimage\"&gt;pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; with 40 years of &lt;a href=\"indulgence\"&gt;indulgence&lt;/a&gt;s, a wildly anachronistic detail, but one quite profitable for the abbey.\nThe accounts in Geoffrey and Gerald make no special mention of Glastonbury. Instead, Gerald's letter from the clerics at St\u00a0David's says that Fagan and \"Duvian\" were the first apostles of all Britain, baptising its king Lucius and then converting all his subjects after their arrival in 140. It says 27 pagan leaders were replaced by the same number of bishops and 3 archbishops placed over them, including one at &lt;a href=\"St%20Davids\"&gt;St Davids&lt;/a&gt;. It advances these points in favor of its independence from &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, a particular project of &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20%28bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s%29\"&gt;Bishop Bernard&lt;/a&gt; (\u00a01115\u2013). Geoffrey also treats Fagan and \"Duvian\" as the first apostles to Britain, noting their conversion of Lucius's petty kings and success at \"almost\" removing paganism from the whole island until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Persecution\"&gt;Great Persecution&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Diocletian\"&gt;Diocletian&lt;/a&gt;. He states that the pagan temples were remade into churches and 28 \"&lt;a href=\"flamen\"&gt;flamen&lt;/a&gt;s\" and 3 \"&lt;a href=\"flamen%23Flamines%20maiores\"&gt;archflamen&lt;/a&gt;s\" were replaced by 28 bishops under the 3 archbishops of &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; (over &lt;a href=\"Loegria\"&gt;Loegria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; (over &lt;a href=\"Deira\"&gt;Deira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Llandaff\"&gt;Caerleon&lt;/a&gt; (over &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;). Fagan and \"Duvian\" were then said to have personally returned to Rome for confirmation of their work, returning again with still more clerics. This all supposedly occurred before the death of Lucius in 156. Gerald elsewhere concedes that the archbishop was initially at Caerleon but claims it was eventually moved to &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; (St Davids). He states the early archbishops administered twelve &lt;a href=\"suffragan%20bishop\"&gt;suffragan&lt;/a&gt;s each and each oversaw one of the five Roman provinces of Britain: &lt;a href=\"Britannia%20Prima\"&gt;Britannia Prima&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Britannia%20Secunda\"&gt;Britannia Secunda&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Valentia%20%28Roman%20Britain%29\"&gt;Valentia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;), Flavia (&lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt;), and Maxima (&lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;). He further concedes, however, his knowledge of the time was mostly based on \"common report\" and not certain history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Liber%20Landavensis\"&gt;Book of Llandaff&lt;/a&gt; composed around 1125 names neither emissary \"from\" Rome but gives \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Elvan\"&gt;Elvan&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Elvanus\") and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Medwin\"&gt;Medwin&lt;/a&gt; (\"Medwinus\") as the names of Lucius's messengers bearing his letter \"to\" the pope. The two accounts were later combined, so that &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Elfan\"&gt;Elfan&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Medwy\"&gt;Medwy&lt;/a&gt;\" are sent off and honored in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and then return with Fagan and Deruvian. Fagan and Dyfan were also sometimes credited with the initial establishment at &lt;a href=\"Congresbury\"&gt;Congresbury&lt;/a&gt;, which was removed in 721 to &lt;a href=\"Tydenton\"&gt;Tydenton&lt;/a&gt; (present-day Wells).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Iolo%20Manuscripts\"&gt;Iolo Manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;, Fagan was called an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20people\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; who came to Britain as a &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; and enthroned himself at \"Llansantffagan\". A separate manuscript credits him with the foundation of the churches at \"Llanffagan Fawr\" (present-day &lt;a href=\"St%20Fagans\"&gt;St Fagans&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;) and at \"Llanffagan Fach\" (present-day &lt;a href=\"Llanmaes\"&gt;Llanmaes&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Llantwit%20Major\"&gt;Llantwit Major&lt;/a&gt;). Their &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt;es are now dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20Mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Saint Mary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Cadoc\"&gt;Saint Cadoc&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. A third manuscript conflates Deruvian with &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Dyfan\"&gt;Dyfan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014wrongly, in &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Bartrum\"&gt;Bartrum&lt;/a&gt;'s estimation. \"Dyfan\" is then made the first &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Llandaff\"&gt;bishop of Llandaff&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Martyr%20of%20the%20Faith\"&gt;martyr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Merthyr%20Dyfan\"&gt;Merthyr Dyfan&lt;/a&gt;. Fagan is then made his successor at Llandaff. (&lt;a href=\"Sabine%20Baring-Gould\"&gt;Baring-Gould&lt;/a&gt; refers to the pair as &lt;a href=\"chorepiscopi\"&gt;chorepiscopi&lt;/a&gt;.) A fourth lists the following triplet among the \"Sayings of the Wise\":\nLife.\nArguing in favor of a partial historicity to these figures, &lt;a href=\"Rice%20Rees\"&gt;Rees&lt;/a&gt; noted that all but Elfan had long-standing associations with &lt;a href=\"llan%20%28placename%29\"&gt;parish churches&lt;/a&gt; in the area around &lt;a href=\"Llandaff\"&gt;Llandaff&lt;/a&gt;, though he admitted none seemed as grand or pre\u00ebminent as one might expect were they actually the &lt;a href=\"apostle\"&gt;apostles&lt;/a&gt; of Britain. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Bartrum\"&gt;Bartrum&lt;/a&gt; replied such dedications must be assumed to post-date Geoffrey's popularity.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"St%20Fagans\"&gt;St Fagans&lt;/a&gt;, a village near &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, continues to bear his name, although following the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20invasion%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Norman invasion of Wales&lt;/a&gt; a new parish church was erected east of the old chapel and dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20Mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;St\u00a0Mary the Blessed Virgin&lt;/a&gt; in 1180. (This is now a &lt;a href=\"Listed%20buildings%20in%20Cardiff%23Grade%20II.2A%20listed%20buildings\"&gt;Grade II*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;.) The 16th-century antiquarian &lt;a href=\"John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29\"&gt;John Leland&lt;/a&gt; recorded in his travel notebooks that a nearby chapel remained dedicated to Fagan and was sometimes also used as the parish church, but this was in ruins by the time of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; a century later. St Fagan's &lt;a href=\"holy%20well\"&gt;Well&lt;/a&gt; was nearby and considered particularly restorative for \"&lt;a href=\"epilepsy\"&gt;the falling sickness&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"St%20Fagan%27s%20Church\"&gt;St Fagan's Church&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href=\"Trecynon\"&gt;Trecynon&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Aberdare\"&gt;Aberdare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt; was a new foundation erected from 1851 to 1853. It was destroyed by fire in 1856. Rebuilt by 1856, &lt;a href=\"John%20Griffith%20%28Anglican%20priest%29\"&gt;John Griffith&lt;/a&gt; established it as a separate parish from Aberdare's ancient one, which had been dedicated to &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Baptist\"&gt;St\u00a0John the Baptist&lt;/a&gt; prior to the completion of &lt;a href=\"St%20Elvan%27s%20Church\"&gt;St\u00a0Elvan's&lt;/a&gt; in 1852.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gwyl%20mabsant\"&gt;festival&lt;/a&gt; of St\u00a0Fagan does not appear in any surviving medieval Welsh &lt;a href=\"calendar%20of%20the%20saints\"&gt;calendar of the saints&lt;/a&gt;, but he had some importance following his description as an apostle: the Blessed &lt;a href=\"John%20Sugar\"&gt;John Sugar&lt;/a&gt;, martyred in 1604, invoked \"Fugatius\" and \"Damianus\" from the gallows as authorities for the antiquity of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20England\"&gt;British Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;. Late sources place it on 3 January (with St\u00a0Dyfan) at &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury\"&gt;Glastonbury&lt;/a&gt;; on 10 February at &lt;a href=\"Llandaff\"&gt;Llandaff&lt;/a&gt;; on 8 August; and (with St\u00a0Dyfan) on 24 or 26 May. &lt;a href=\"May%2026%20%28Eastern%20Orthodox%20liturgics%29\"&gt;This last date&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the traditional day of the baptism of King\u00a0Lucius by the missionaries\u2014is sometimes given as an observance of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; diocese of &lt;a href=\"Thyateira%20and%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Thyateira and Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, although in fact St\u00a0Fagan's Day is currently unobserved by any of the major &lt;a href=\"Christian%20denominations\"&gt;denominations&lt;/a&gt; of Wales."
