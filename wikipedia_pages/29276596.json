    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; is part of the &lt;a href=\"Tigris%E2%80%93Euphrates%20river%20system\"&gt;Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system&lt;/a&gt; basin. Several Tigris\u2013Euphrates &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt;s form parts of the Kuwait\u2013Iraq border. Kuwait does not currently have any permanent rivers, but does have several &lt;a href=\"wadi\"&gt;wadi&lt;/a&gt;s, the most notable of which is &lt;a href=\"Wadi%20al%20Batin\"&gt;Wadi al Batin&lt;/a&gt;, which forms the border between Kuwait and Iraq. Kuwait also has several river-like marine channels around &lt;a href=\"Bubiyan%20Island\"&gt;Bubiyan Island&lt;/a&gt;, most notably &lt;a href=\"Khawr%20Abd%20Allah\"&gt;Khawr Abd Allah&lt;/a&gt; which is now an estuary, but once was the point where the &lt;a href=\"Shatt%20al-Arab\"&gt;Shatt al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; emptied into the Persian Gulf. Khawr Abd Allah is located in southern Iraq and northern Kuwait, the &lt;a href=\"Iraq-Kuwait%20border\"&gt;Iraq-Kuwait border&lt;/a&gt; divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of &lt;a href=\"Umm%20Qasr\"&gt;Umm Qasr&lt;/a&gt; the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi. It forms the northeast coastline of Bubiyan Island and the north coastline of &lt;a href=\"Warbah%20Island\"&gt;Warbah Island&lt;/a&gt;."
