Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, following a ten-year motion picture production agreement.\nCompany.\nAlcon Entertainment was established in January 23, 1997, and founded by film producers &lt;a href=\"Broderick%20Johnson\"&gt;Broderick Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Kosove\"&gt;Andrew Kosove&lt;/a&gt;, who are the co-CEOs of the company.

Both Johnson and Kosove presented FedEx founder and chairman &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20W.%20Smith\"&gt;Frederick W. Smith&lt;/a&gt; with a proposal suggesting that an independent film company, backed by a capitalized individual or company, and aligned with a major studio for an exclusive distribution arrangement would reap profits on copyrighted assets over a set period of time. On February 18, 1998, Alcon Entertainment has set up two greenlight projects, with &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; distributing a single project.

The agreement also allowed Warner Bros. to co-finance certain pictures with Alcon. Alcon and Warner Bros. signed a new agreement in February 2006, continuing their eight-year relationship, under which Warner Bros. would continue to distribute feature films developed and financed by Alcon. WB and Alcon extended the deal in 2015 which ended in 2019.
