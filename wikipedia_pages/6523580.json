    "text": "Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo (born January 8, 1946), commonly referred to by his aliases El Jefe de Jefes (\"The Boss of Bosses\") and El Padrino (\"The Godfather\"), is a &lt;a href=\"convicted\"&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; Mexican &lt;a href=\"drug%20lord\"&gt;drug lord&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara%20Cartel\"&gt;Guadalajara Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. \nThroughout the 1980s, the cartel controlled much of the drug trafficking in Mexico and the corridors along the &lt;a href=\"Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border\"&gt;Mexico\u2013United States border&lt;/a&gt;.\nFelix Gallardo was arrested in 1989 for the murder of &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;Drug Enforcement Administration&lt;/a&gt; (DEA) agent &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Camarena%20%28DEA%20agent%29\"&gt;Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena&lt;/a&gt;. F\u00e9lix Gallardo was serving his 40-year sentence at the &lt;a href=\"Altiplano%20prison\"&gt;Altiplano&lt;/a&gt; maximum-security prison but was transferred to a medium-security facility in 2014 due to his declining health.\nEarly life.\nBorn on a ranch in Bellavista, on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Culiac%C3%A1n%2C%20Sinaloa\"&gt;Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa&lt;/a&gt;, F\u00e9lix Gallardo graduated from high school and studied business in college. He took a job as a Mexican &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Judicial%20Police\"&gt;Federal Judicial Police&lt;/a&gt; agent. He worked as a family bodyguard for the governor of Sinaloa state &lt;a href=\"Leopoldo%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Celis\"&gt;Leopoldo S\u00e1nchez Celis&lt;/a&gt;, whose political connections helped F\u00e9lix Gallardo to build his drug trafficking organization. F\u00e9lix Gallardo was also the godfather of Celis' son Rodolfo.\nF\u00e9lix Gallardo started working for drug traffickers brokering corruption of state officials, and together with &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Caro%20Quintero\"&gt;Rafael Caro Quintero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ernesto%20Fonseca%20Carrillo\"&gt;Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;, who previously worked in the &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Avil%C3%A9s%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Avil\u00e9s criminal organization&lt;/a&gt;, took control of the trafficking routes after &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Avil%C3%A9s%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Avil\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt; was killed in a police shootout.\nConnections to Colombian cartels.\nIn the early 1980s, &lt;a href=\"Organized%20Crime%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Task%20Force\"&gt;drug interdiction efforts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blanco%23Miami%20drug%20war\"&gt;increased throughout Florida&lt;/a&gt;, which was then the major shipping destination for illegal drug traffickers. As a result, the Colombian cartels began to utilize Mexico as their primary trans-shipment point.\n&lt;a href=\"Juan%20Matta-Ballesteros\"&gt;Juan Matta-Ballesteros&lt;/a&gt; was the Guadalajara Cartel's primary connection to the Colombian cartels, as he had originally introduced Felix Gallardo's predecessor, Alberto Sicilia-Falcon, to Santiago Ocampo of the &lt;a href=\"Cali%20Cartel\"&gt;Cali Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest Colombian drug cartels. Rather than taking cash payments for their services, the smugglers in the Guadalajara Cartel took a 50% cut of the cocaine they transported from Colombia. This proved to be extremely profitable for them, with some estimating that the trafficking network, then operated by Felix Gallardo, Ernesto Carrillo and Rafael Quintero, was pulling in approximately $5 billion annually.\nUntil the end of the 1980s, the &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara%20Cartel\"&gt;Guadalajara Cartel&lt;/a&gt; headed by Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo (comprising what is now known today as the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juarez and Pacifico Sur cartels) had nearly monopolized the illegal drug trade in Mexico.\nMurder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena.\nIn 1980 DEA special agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena was assigned to the Administration's resident agency in Guadalajara. Working through informants, Camarena discovered cartel marijuana plantations in Zacatecas state. The plantations were raided and destroyed. In 1984, Mexican soldiers, backed by helicopters, destroyed an even larger 1,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt; (\u22482,500\u00a0&lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;) marijuana plantation known as \"Rancho B\u00fafalo\" in &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, known to be protected by &lt;a href=\"Direcci%C3%B3n%20Federal%20de%20Seguridad\"&gt;Mexican DFS&lt;/a&gt; intelligence agents, as part of \"Operation Godfather\". Thousands of farmers worked the fields at Rancho Buffalo, and the annual production was later valued at 8 billion. All of this took place with the knowledge of local police, politicians, and the military. Camarena was beginning to expose the connections among drug traffickers, Mexican law enforcement, and high-ranking government officials within the &lt;a href=\"Partido%20Revolucionario%20Institucional\"&gt;Partido Revolucionario Institucional&lt;/a&gt; (PRI), which F\u00e9lix Gallardo considered to be a major threat to the Guadalajara cartel's operations throughout Mexico.\nIn response, F\u00e9lix Gallardo reportedly ordered the kidnapping of Camarena. On February 7, 1985, &lt;a href=\"Jalisco\"&gt;Jalisco&lt;/a&gt; police officers on the cartel's payroll kidnapped Camarena as he left the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara. His helicopter pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, was kidnapped shortly afterward. They were brought to a residence located at 881 Lope de Vega in the colonia of Jardines del Bosque, in the western section of the city of Guadalajara, owned by Rafael Caro Quintero, where they were tortured and interrogated over a period of 30 hours. On February 9, Camarena was killed when a hole was made in his head with a power drill. They drilled a hole into his brain to cause debilitating pain before his death. He was also shot up with adrenaline and other drugs to be kept awake during his torture and interrogation. His body, wrapped in plastic, was found with Zavala Avelar's in a shallow hole on a ranch in Michoacan state.\nCamarena's murder prompted one of the largest DEA homicide investigations ever undertaken, Operation Leyenda. A special unit was dispatched to coordinate the investigation in Mexico, where corrupt officials were being implicated.\nInvestigators identified F\u00e9lix Gallardo and his two close associates, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero, as the primary suspects in the kidnapping. Under pressure from the US, Fonseca and Quintero were apprehended, but F\u00e9lix Gallardo still enjoyed political protection.\nArrest.\nF\u00e9lix Gallardo kept a low profile and, in 1987, moved with his family to &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara\"&gt;Guadalajara&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested in Mexico on April 8, 1989, and was charged by the authorities in Mexico and the United States with the kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, as well as &lt;a href=\"racketeering\"&gt;racketeering&lt;/a&gt;, drug smuggling, and multiple violent crimes.\nAccording to US officials, F\u00e9lix Gallardo also spent time at the Sinaloa governor's house as a guest, which governor &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Toledo%20Corro\"&gt;Antonio Toledo Corro&lt;/a&gt; has denied. When asked about his association with F\u00e9lix Gallardo, governor Toledo said he was \"unaware of any outstanding arrest warrants\" against F\u00e9lix Gallardo.\nThe arrest of F\u00e9lix Gallardo was the catalyst for exposing the widespread corruption at political and law enforcement levels in Mexico. Within days of F\u00e9lix Gallardo's arrest, and under pressure from the media, several police commanders were arrested with as many as 90 officers deserting.\nFelix Gallardo's arrest also led to the dismantling of the Guadalajara Cartel, as key members of the federation chose to withdraw and form their own cartels, relying on violence to claim various territories and trafficking routes. The continuous disputes and conflict among the leaders would breed political, social, and military chaos, and eventually lead to the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Drug%20War\"&gt;Mexican Drug War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncarceration.\nFelix Gallardo was initially sentenced to 40 years of prison. After serving 28 years, a 2017 retrial sentenced him to an additional 37 years. While incarcerated, F\u00e9lix Gallardo remained one of Mexico's major traffickers, maintaining his organization via mobile phone.\nAfter his arrest, F\u00e9lix Gallardo decided to divide up the trade he controlled as it would be more efficient and less likely to be brought down by law enforcement. F\u00e9lix Gallardo instructed his lawyer to convene the nation's top drug narcos in 1989 at a house in the resort of Acapulco where he designated the \"plazas\" or territories. The Tijuana route would go to his nephews, the &lt;a href=\"Tijuana%20Cartel\"&gt;Arellano Felix brothers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ju%C3%A1rez%20Cartel\"&gt;Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez route&lt;/a&gt; would go to the &lt;a href=\"Amado%20Carrillo%20Fuentes\"&gt;Carrillo Fuentes family&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Caro%20Quintero\"&gt;Miguel Caro Quintero&lt;/a&gt; would run the &lt;a href=\"Sonora%20Cartel\"&gt;Sonora corridor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Guzm%C3%A1n%20Loera\"&gt;Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9ctor%20Luis%20Palma%20Salazar\"&gt;H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar&lt;/a&gt; were left the Pacific coast operations, with &lt;a href=\"Ismael%20Zambada%20Garc%C3%ADa\"&gt;Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; joining them soon after and thus becoming the &lt;a href=\"Sinaloa%20Cartel\"&gt;Sinaloa Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, which was not a party to the 1989 pact.\nF\u00e9lix Gallardo was transferred to a high-security prison in 1993, he lost any remaining control over the other drug lords.\nAs he aged, F\u00e9lix Gallardo complained that he lived in poor conditions while in jail. He says that he suffers from &lt;a href=\"vertigo\"&gt;vertigo&lt;/a&gt;, deafness, loss of an eye, and blood circulation problems. He lives in a 240 \u00d7 440\u00a0cm (8x14ft) cell, which he is not allowed to leave, even to use the recreational area. In March 2013, F\u00e9lix Gallardo started a legal process to continue his prison sentence at home when he reached his 70th birthday (8 January 2016). On 29 April 2014, a Mexican federal court denied F\u00e9lix Gallardo's petition to be transferred from the maximum-security prison to a medium-security one. On 18 December 2014, federal authorities approved his request to transfer to a medium-security prison in Guadalajara (State of Jalisco), due to his declining health.\nOn 20 February 2019, a court in Mexico City denied his request to complete the remainder of his sentence at his home. The court stated that F\u00e9lix Gallardo's defense did not provide them with sufficient evidence to prove that his health issues were putting his life at risk.\nMemoirs.\nIn 2008, the investigative journalist was able to contact F\u00e9lix Gallardo through the latter's 13-year-old son. Through this connection, the first memoirs of a Mexican drug lord were written from prison, in secret and hurriedly, by hand, by an author with ailing vision. The memoirs include narrative about his arrest and presentation before police, and explains a bit of his family tree, jumping from one topic to another. Selections of the 35 pages were published in the Mexican magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Gatopardo%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Gatopardo&lt;/a&gt;,\" with background by the journalist.\nFamily.\nUpon his arrest at least nine of Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo's nieces and nephews took over different roles within the organization to form the Arellano F\u00e9lix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel. Another niece, Sandra \u00c1vila Beltr\u00e1n, is a former member of the Sinaloa Cartel.\nMembers of the Arellano F\u00e9lix Organization (Tijuana Cartel)\nSinaloa Cartel"
