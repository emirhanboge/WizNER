    "text": "The Munich derby () is the name given to &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches between &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;FC Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TSV%201860%20Munich\"&gt;TSV 1860 Munich&lt;/a&gt;, both of them from &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1902\u20131933).\nAlthough the TSV has existed since 1860, a football section was founded in 1899. In contrast, Bayern was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club. The first ever Munich derby was contested in September 1902. In the first years, Bayern mainly won the derbies. However, since &lt;a href=\"football%20in%20Germany\"&gt;football in Germany&lt;/a&gt; was organised on a very regional level in this time, the rivalry was not very pronounced since both team played against many other &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;-based teams such as &lt;a href=\"FC%20Wacker%20M%C3%BCnchen\"&gt;FC Wacker M\u00fcnchen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"1.%20M%C3%BCnchner%20FC%201896\"&gt;1. M\u00fcnchner FC 1896&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of this period, both clubs became more and more successful: 1860 entered the final of the German football championship in &lt;a href=\"1931%20German%20football%20championship%23Final\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt; (but lost against &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20BSC\"&gt;Hertha BSC&lt;/a&gt;) and Bayern won against &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1932%20German%20football%20championship%23Final\"&gt;one year later&lt;/a&gt;. In 1933, 1860 reached the final of the .\nThe Nazi period (1933\u20131945).\nWith beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi era in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, both clubs were put in the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Bayern\"&gt;Gauliga Bayern&lt;/a&gt;. In this period, Bayern suffered because many &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; members, such as &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Landauer\"&gt;Kurt Landauer&lt;/a&gt; were forced to leave the club. In contrast, 1860 was less affected by the enforcement of the &lt;a href=\"Aryan%20paragraph\"&gt;Aryan paragraph&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;war time&lt;/a&gt;, 1860 became successful: They won their first national trophy the \"Tschammerpokal\" (today known as the &lt;a href=\"German%20Cup\"&gt;German Cup&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"1942%20Tschammerpokal%23Final\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;. 1860 returned to the national playoffs in &lt;a href=\"1943%20German%20football%20championship\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the quarter-finals.\nIncreasing rivalry (1945\u20131963).\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe\"&gt;end of the second World War&lt;/a&gt;, football quickly became popular again in the population. Already in 1945, the &lt;a href=\"American%20Occupation%20of%20Germany%23American%20Zone%20of%20Occupation\"&gt;American allied administration&lt;/a&gt; allowed the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29\"&gt;Oberliga S\u00fcd&lt;/a&gt;. As this league, in contrast to the previous &lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Bayern\"&gt;Gauliga Bayern&lt;/a&gt;, also included teams from &lt;a href=\"Hesse\"&gt;Hesse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt;, Bayern and 1860 became the only two clubs from Munich which resulted in an increased rivalry. Other Munich-based teams declined in importance. In this period, both teams could hardly point to successes with the exception of Bayern's victory in the &lt;a href=\"1956%E2%80%9357%20DFB-Pokal\"&gt;1957 German Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nStruggle for domination (1963\u20131970).\nThe regulations by the &lt;a href=\"German%20Football%20Association\"&gt;German football federation&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1963-64%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;inaugural&lt;/a&gt; Bundesliga season stipulated that only one team from one city should be promoted. Due to opaque rules, Bayern instead of 1860 was forced to play in the second tier. 1860 won the &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20DFB-Pokal\"&gt;German Cup&lt;/a&gt; in this season, followed by a successful European campaign leading to &lt;a href=\"1965%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup final&lt;/a&gt; which was lost to &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20FC\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;. In Bayern's &lt;a href=\"1965-66%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;season of promotion&lt;/a&gt; Munich became the football capital of Germany: 1860 clinched their first Bundesliga title whereas Bayern won the &lt;a href=\"1965%E2%80%9366%20DFB-Pokal%23Final\"&gt;German Cup final&lt;/a&gt;. After that, the conditions began to turn: While 1860 gained the second place in the &lt;a href=\"1966-67%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;, Bayern &lt;a href=\"1966%E2%80%9367%20DFB-Pokal%23Final\"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the German Cup and won the &lt;a href=\"1967%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Nuremberg. In 1969, Bayern captured their first German &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; whereas 1860 slipped to the 10th position. One year later, 1860 relegated from the Bundesliga.\nBayern's golden years, 1860's decline (1970\u20131994).\nWith 1860's relegation, the relative strengths now completely turned to Bayern. After moving from &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%BCnwalder%20Stadion\"&gt;Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion&lt;/a&gt; to the much larger &lt;a href=\"Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29\"&gt;Olympiastadion&lt;/a&gt;, Bayern's golden years began. Three German championships (&lt;a href=\"1971-72%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1973-74%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;) followed by three victorious European campaigns (&lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;) marked the most successful period in Bayern's history. While Bayern became established in the Bundesliga, 1860 became a &lt;a href=\"yo-yo%20club\"&gt;yo-yo club&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1999, the last derby won by 1860 was in &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;. Even in the frequently played friendlies, Bayern mostly kept the upper hand.\nBundesliga return of 1860 (1994\u20132004).\nAfter 13 years mainly spent in the &lt;a href=\"Bayernliga\"&gt;Bayernliga&lt;/a&gt;, 1860 promoted again to the top flight in 1994. In the &lt;a href=\"1993-94%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;previous season&lt;/a&gt;, Bayern clinched their 13th Bundesliga title. In &lt;a href=\"1999-2000%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, 1860 won their first derby since 22 years. After also the return match was won, Bayern regained its leadership role again with some very high wins (5\u20131 in &lt;a href=\"2001-02%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; and 5\u20130 in &lt;a href=\"2002-03%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;). Due to the successful application of the &lt;a href=\"German%20football%20federation\"&gt;German football federation&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in June 2000, both club's forced the idea of ground-share in a &lt;a href=\"Allianz%20Arena\"&gt;new stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nGround-sharing in the Allianz Arena (2005\u20132017).\nOne year before the clubs moved to the Allianz Arena, 1860 relegated to the &lt;a href=\"2.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Fu\u00dfball-Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; again. Since then, in addition to three friendly matches, only one competitive game was held. Just one day before the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20DFB-Pokal%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; was held, unknown Bayern fans painted parts of the Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion, 1860 traditional home stadium, in the club colors of Bayern, red and white.\nMunich 1860 were relegated to &lt;a href=\"3.%20Liga\"&gt;3. Liga&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the 2016-17 season.\n1860's Return to Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion (2017\u2013).\nOn 2 June 2017, it was announced that 1860 were unable to obtain a 3. Liga license for the 2017\u201318 season as a result of investor Hassan Ismaik's unwillingness to pay the necessary fees. As a result, the club was relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20Bayern\"&gt;Regionalliga Bayern&lt;/a&gt; for the 2017\u201318 season. Following these events, which meant that Bayern Munich would be ground sharing with the now amateur status 1860, on July 12, 2017 Bayern Munich announced that the ground sharing arrangement with 1860 had come to an end. Shortly thereafter, Munich 1860 announced that the club would return to its traditional grounds at Stadion an der Gr\u00fcnwalder Stra\u00dfe for the 2017-18 season. Following relegation to the Regionalliga, 1860 will play matches with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20II\"&gt;FC Bayern Munich II&lt;/a&gt;.\nResults involving reserve teams.\nWith the two senior teams playing in different leagues the meetings between the two reserve sides of the clubs, nowadays in the tier four &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20Bayern\"&gt;Regionalliga Bayern&lt;/a&gt;, have received increased attention. The most recent derbies have attracted almost capacity crowds of 12,500 in the Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadium, but also made heavy police presence necessary to deal with the rival fan fractions. The games have also, on occasion, been broadcast live on television.\nThe games of the reserve sides of the two clubs since the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994:\nThe games between first team of 1860 Munich and reserve side of Bayern Munich:"
