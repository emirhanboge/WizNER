    "text": "Nannodastiidae are a small family of &lt;a href=\"Acalyptratae\"&gt;acalyptrate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; placed in two genera. They were formerly included within the &lt;a href=\"Ephydridae\"&gt;Ephydridae&lt;/a&gt; or shore flies. These are small to minute flies which are dull coloured with clear wings. They are identified by a combination of &lt;a href=\"seta\"&gt;seta&lt;/a&gt;l characters visible only under a microscope and genital features which require specimen dissection. They are found along coasts and in bat caves rich in guano."
