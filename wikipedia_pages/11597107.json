    "text": "Charles Martin (May 20, 1856\u00a0\u2013 October 28, 1917) was a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. Representative&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn near Ogdensburg, St. Lawrence County, New York, Martin moved with his parents to &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, in 1860. He attended the public schools, and engaged in business as a sewer contractor and later as a coal dealer. Martin served as alderman in the city council from 1894 to 1902, 1905 to 1907, 1910 to 1914, and was again elected in 1915.\nMartin was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"65th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Sixty-fifth&lt;/a&gt; Congress and served from March 4, 1917, until his death in &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, October 28, 1917. He was interred in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olivet%20Cemetery%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Mount Olivet Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. \nControversy Over Birth Certificate Legality.\nNew York authorities found that his birth certificate may have been lost in an incident three years prior to his death. Investigations into the loss of the birth certificate were able to locate the missing birth certificate underneath a filing cabinet in the old New York records building. Group members of the opposing political party questioned Martin's lack of birth certificate publicly, causing Martin to lose an amount of respect in the public's eye. GOP candidates in Illinois never acknowledged the missing birth certificate until after Martin's death. Eventually, they seceded on the argument and acknowledged the legitimacy of the document. Recent studies into the incident have been inconclusive."
