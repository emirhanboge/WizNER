    "text": "Palmyra Delran is an American rock and roll musician, songwriter, guitarist and producer who was born in &lt;a href=\"Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and later moved to &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. She played in seminal 1990s Philadelphia-area rock bands &lt;a href=\"The%20Friggs\"&gt;The Friggs&lt;/a&gt; and Pink Slip Daddy, as well as several of her own solo releases and recordings.\nIn 2008, Delran released \"She Digs the Ride\", a six-track EP, featuring the song \"Baby Should Have Known Better\", which was selected by &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;Little Steven's Underground Garage&lt;/a&gt; as The Coolest Song in the World in 2008, and which gained Delran considerable attention for her efforts.\n&lt;a href=\"Steven%20Van%20Zandt\"&gt;Little Steven Van Zandt&lt;/a&gt; was a reported fan of Delran's previous band, the Friggs, and attended their 2008 NYC reunion show. After striking up a conversation with Palmyra, he learned of her new solo EP \"She Digs the Ride\". He added it to the Underground Garage playlist, picking \"Baby Should Have Known Better\" as a \"Coolest Song in the World This Week\", followed by radio listeners voting it \"Coolest Song in the World\" for 2008.\nThe EP was followed up in 2013 with \"You Are What You Absorb\", Delran's first full-length solo effort. The album included the single \"You\u2019re My Brian Jones\", featuring a music video directed by Daniel Henry, and shot on location in &lt;a href=\"Nashville\"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt;. Little Steven continued his support of Delran's work, voting \"You're My Brian Jones\" his No. 1 song of the year. In 2013, the songs \"Shy Boy\" and \"Some Day Soon\" ranked among favorites on Steven's and many Underground Garage DJ lists. Steven also voted the full album \"You Are What You Absorb\" as the No. 3 best record of 2013.\nDelran tours the East Coast, Scandinavia, and the West Coast each year, and released a new single in spring/summer of 2014, \"Run Now Baby\" b/w \"Yeah Yeah Yeah.\" The single was recorded in LA with Dave Klein &amp; Bubble Gun, and features special guest Kim Shattuck from &lt;a href=\"The%20Muffs\"&gt;The Muffs&lt;/a&gt;. She is also currently writing songs with &lt;a href=\"Handsome%20Dick%20Manitoba\"&gt;Handsome Dick Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; &amp; Ross the Boss for the new &lt;a href=\"The%20Dictators\"&gt;Dictators NYC&lt;/a&gt; recordings.\nPrevious Acts.\nPink Slip Daddy.\nDelran was born in &lt;a href=\"Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and later moved to &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, where she met musician and rock critic Mike Ferguson, formerly of the group Sickidz!. The two began playing together under the name Das Yahoos, with Delran on drums, as well as members Robbie Rip-Rock (Rob Windfelder of the group Live Not On Evil) on guitar, and Clams Casino (Mark Fletcher) on bass. The band would break up in 1988, but Ferguson and Delran quickly formed a new band, called Pink Slip Daddy, adding Barb Dwyer on bass and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Vaughn\"&gt;Ben Vaughn&lt;/a&gt; (performing as Sal Mineo's Only Son) on guitar.\nPink Slip Daddy toured for several years, releasing a number of records on Apex East, &lt;a href=\"Get%20Hip%20Records\"&gt;Get Hip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sympathy%20for%20the%20Record%20Industry\"&gt;Sympathy for the Record Industry&lt;/a&gt; to critical praise before going on hiatus in 1993. The band reunited in 2013 for one show, and have indicated potential reunion dates in the future.\nThe Friggs.\nIn 1991, Delran formed The Friggs, a project featuring Barb Dwyer, as well as guitarist, vocalist, and co-songwriter Jezebel. Playing a blend of sleaze-pop, rock, surf and punk, the band was critically and commercially embraced, touring almost non-stop for 10\u00a0years. The band has shared the bill with rock legends &lt;a href=\"the%20Ramones\"&gt;the Ramones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Trick\"&gt;Cheap Trick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Selecter\"&gt;The Selecter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Dale\"&gt;Dick Dale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleshtones\"&gt;The Fleshtones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Culture%20on%20the%20Skids\"&gt;Southern Culture on the Skids&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. Other members have included Petula Wilde, J. Whitey Smythe, Ginga Moon, Janey West, Suki Von Trapp, Kami, Lexi Plumm, Kitten LaChaCha, and Mitzi Dodge.\nThe Friggs\u2019 music has appeared in a number of films, including \"&lt;a href=\"Superbad%20%28film%29\"&gt;Superbad&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Jawbreaker%20%28film%29\"&gt;Jawbreaker&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Prey%20for%20Rock%20and%20Roll\"&gt;Prey for Rock and Roll&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Lipstick%20and%20Dynamite\"&gt;Lipstick and Dynamite&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Todd%20Schorr%23The%20Treasures%20of%20Long%20Gone%20John\"&gt;The Treasures of Long Gone John&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter a number of EP's, 7\u00a0inch singles and compilations, the band released the album \"Rock Candy\" in 1997, and continued touring through 2001, when the band went on an indefinite break. In 2007, the band released \"Today is Tomorrow's Yesterday\", a compilation of unreleased songs and past singles from the band.\nVarious Projects.\nKinderAngst.\nWritten in collaboration with friend and fellow songwriter Rachelle Garniez, \"KinderAngst\", an album of punk and rock 'n' roll songs for kids was released in 2012. The album, produced by Delran and Garniez, featured 14 songs dedicated to the stresses and challenges of being a child, and using music to express their feelings. \"KinderAngst\" also features an appearance by &lt;a href=\"Debbie%20Harry\"&gt;Debbie Harry&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blondie%20%28band%29\"&gt;Blondie&lt;/a&gt;.\nBooty Olympics/Santa Marias.\nDelran played drums in the Booty Olympics in the early 2000s, who released \"Boystyle\" in 2003. The band later changed their name to Santa Marias, and released a self-titled CD in 2007.\nReleases.\nPalmyra Delran Solo Releases.\nCD's\nYou Are What You Absorb Produced by Palmyra Delran\nApex East Recordings \u2013 12 track CD (2013)\nShe Digs the Ride Produced by Palmyra Delran\nApex East Recordings \u2013 6 Song EP (2008)\nCOMPILATIONS\nLittle Steven's Underground Garage Coolest Songs in the World, Vol 8\nWicked Cool \u2013 1 song (2009)\nWith The Friggs.\nCD's\nToday Is Tomorrow's Yesterday Produced by Ben Vaughn\nApex East Recording \u2013 15 song CD (2007)\nRock Candy Produced by Dave O'Donnell\ne-vil records \u2013 10 song CD (1997)\nVINYL SINGLES &amp; EP's\nJuiced Up b/w Mama Blew a Hoody Produced by Dave O'Donnell\nFeralette Records \u2013 7\" single (1995)\nAmerica's Only Rock &amp; Roll Magazine Parody 10\" EP Produced by Ben Vaughn\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 4 songs (1994)\nShake b/w Wild Love Produced by Ben Vaughn\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 7\" single (1992)\nBad Word for a Good Thing b/w Friggs Theme Produced by Ben Vaughn\nTelstar Records \u2013 7\" single (1992)\nCome Now b/w Dance of Love Produced by Ben Vaughn\nApex Recording Service \u2013 7\" single (1991)\nCOMPILATIONS\nMusic to Read Carbon 14 By vol. 1 compilation\nC14 Records \u2013 1 song (2005)\nHow Many Bands Does It Take to Screw Up a Blondie Tribute\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 1 song (2004)\nAlright, This Time Just the Girls compilation\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 1 song (2004)\nTheir Sympathetic Majesties Request vol. 2 compilation\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 1 song (2003)\nJawbreaker Movie soundtrack CD\nLondon Records \u2013 1 song (1998)\nTheir Sympathetic Majesties Request vol. 1 compilation\nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 1 song (1998)\nToday's Top Girl Groups, Vol.1 Produced by Ben Vaughn\nSpinout Records \u2013 1 song (1998)\nSeason's Greetings Philadelphia Christmas compilation\nRecord Cellar Records \u2013 1 song (1997)\nTurban Renewal \u2013 Sam the Sham tribute LP/CD Produced by Bruce Bennett\nNorton Records \u2013 1 song (1994)\nCarbon 14 Magazine Give Away EP Produced by Ben Vaughn\nC14 Records \u2013 1 song (1994)\nWith Pink Slip Daddy.\nLP's &amp; CD's\nRock Damage and Other Love Songs Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 13 song LP/CD (1993)\nAntidisestablishmentarianism Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nApex Recording Service \u2013 13 song LP /CD (1990)\nPink Slip Daddy Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nApex Recording Service \u2013 10 song LP (1988)\nVINYL SINGLES &amp; EP's&lt;br&gt; \nL.S.D. 10\" EP Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nApex Recording Service \u2013 4 song 10\" EP (1989)\nJunkyard b/w Live Sex &amp; Violence Produced by Ben Vaughn &lt;br&gt; \nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 7\" single (1991)\nRock Old Sputnik to the Moon b/w Shaggy Dog Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nGet Hip Records \u2013 7\" single (1991)\nWith Bubble Gun.\n CD single\nRun Now Baby b/w Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Produced by Palmyra Delran &amp; Dave Klein&lt;br&gt; \n9 Volt Jolt Records \u2013 2 song CD (2014)\nCOMPILATIONS&lt;br&gt; \nTheir Sympathetic Majesties Request vol.1 compilation Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nSympathy for the Record Industry \u2013 1 song (1998)\nthe Singer Not the Song Alex Chilton Tribute CD Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nMunster Records \u2013 1 song (1992)\nBonograph Sonny Bono Tribute CD Produced by Ben Vaughn&lt;br&gt; \nBogus Records \u2013 1 song (1991)\nMusic videos.\nLies For You \u2013 Created by John Valentine &amp; eM*L*E &lt;br&gt;\nShut Out \u2013 Created by John Valentine &amp; eM*L*E&lt;br&gt;\nYou\u2019re My Brian Jones \u2013 Directed by Daniel Henry, Produced by Price Harrison, Cinematography by Dustin Lane&lt;br&gt;\nThe Making Of You\u2019re My Brian Jones \u2013 Created by Price Harrison&lt;br&gt;\nThe Turtle \u2013 Created by Palmyra Delran\nPalmyra Delran Touring Bands.\nEast Coast.\nPalmyra: Vocals, Guitar\nMichael Lynch: Bass, Vocals\nRichard DevGreene: Guitar, Vocals\nMark Brotter: Drums\nWest Coast.\nBUBBLE GUN\nPalmyra: Vocals, Guitar\nJohn Carlucci: Bass\nLaura Carlucci: Keyboards, Vocals\nMichelle Balderrama: Guitar, Vocals\nRikki Styxx: Drums, Vocals\nScandinavia.\nSTUPIDITY\nPalmyra: Vocals, Guitar\nErniz: Backing Vocals, Percussion\nPA: Guitar, Vocals\nMiss Anna: Bass\nTommy Boy: Drums"
