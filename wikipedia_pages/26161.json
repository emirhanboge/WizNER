    "text": "Robert Fulton (November 14, 1765 \u2013 February 24, 1815) was an American &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inventor\"&gt;inventor&lt;/a&gt; who is widely credited with developing the world's first commercially successful &lt;a href=\"steamboat\"&gt;steamboat&lt;/a&gt;, the (also known as \"Clermont\"). In 1807, that steamboat traveled on the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; with passengers from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; and back again, a round trip of , in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traffic and trade on major American rivers.\nIn 1800, Fulton had been commissioned by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt;, leader of France, to attempt to design a submarine; he produced , the first practical &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; in history. Fulton is also credited with inventing some of the world's earliest naval &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es for use by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFulton became interested in &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s and the idea of steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20%28delegate%29\"&gt;William Henry&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lancaster, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, who was interested in this topic. Henry had learned about inventor &lt;a href=\"James%20Watt\"&gt;James Watt&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Watt%20steam%20engine\"&gt;Watt steam engine&lt;/a&gt; on an earlier visit to &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nRobert Fulton was born on a farm in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Britain%20Township%2C%20Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Little Britain, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, on November 14, 1765. His father, Robert Fulton, married Mary Smith, daughter of Captain Joseph Smith and sister of Col. Lester Smith, a comparatively well off family. He had three sisters \u2013 Isabella, Elizabeth, and Mary, and a younger brother, Abraham.\nFor six years, he lived in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, where he painted portraits and landscapes, drew houses and machinery, and was able to send money home to help support his mother. In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20Township%2C%20Washington%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Hopewell Township&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Washington County&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a380 (equivalent to $ in 2018), and moved his mother and family into it.\nJobs.\nCareer in Europe (1786\u20131806).\nAt the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20West\"&gt;Benjamin West&lt;/a&gt;; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for &lt;a href=\"tugboat\"&gt;tugboat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794, and also began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a &lt;a href=\"Dredging\"&gt;dredging machine&lt;/a&gt; and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Owen\"&gt;Robert Owen&lt;/a&gt;, a cotton manufacturer and early &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt;. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.\nAs early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt;s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by &lt;a href=\"Claude%20de%20Jouffroy\"&gt;Claude de Jouffroy&lt;/a&gt; in France. Called \"Palmip\u00e8de\", it was tested on the &lt;a href=\"Doubs%20%28river%29\"&gt;Doubs&lt;/a&gt; in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built , the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor &lt;a href=\"John%20Fitch%20%28inventor%29\"&gt;John Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20River\"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt; on August 22, 1787. &lt;a href=\"William%20Symington\"&gt;William Symington&lt;/a&gt; had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\nIn Britain, Fulton met the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Egerton%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Bridgewater\"&gt;Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton&lt;/a&gt;, whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of Benjamin Powell. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened \"Bonaparte\" in honour of Fulton having served under &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on , constructed by Symington.\nIn 1797, Fulton went to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where he was well known as an inventor. He studied &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met &lt;a href=\"James%20Rumsey\"&gt;James Rumsey&lt;/a&gt;, an inventor from &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786, ran his own first steamboat up the &lt;a href=\"Potomac%20River\"&gt;Potomac River&lt;/a&gt;. Fulton also exhibited the first &lt;a href=\"panorama\"&gt;panorama&lt;/a&gt; painting to be shown in Paris, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Pr%C3%A9vost%20%28painter%29\"&gt;Pierre Pr\u00e9vost&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries\" (1800), on what is still called \"Rue des Panoramas\" (Panorama Street) today. While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, , between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually, he approached the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Marine%20%28France%29\"&gt;Minister of Marine&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1800, was granted permission to build. The shipyard Perrier in &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt; built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the &lt;a href=\"Seine%20River\"&gt;Seine River&lt;/a&gt; in the same city.\nIn France, Fulton met &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Livingston%20%281746%E2%80%931813%29\"&gt;Robert R. Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, who was appointed &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Ambassador%20to%20France\"&gt;U.S. Ambassador to France&lt;/a&gt; in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was long, with an beam, and made between against the current.\nIn 1804, Fulton &lt;a href=\"allegiance\"&gt;switched allegiance&lt;/a&gt; and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger\"&gt;William Pitt the Younger&lt;/a&gt; to build a range of weapons for use by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon's&lt;/a&gt; invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20Boulogne\"&gt;Raid on Boulogne&lt;/a&gt;, but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the crushing naval victory by Admiral &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Horatio Nelson&lt;/a&gt; at the 1805 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt; greatly reduced the &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%27s%20planned%20invasion%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;risk of French invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Fulton was increasingly sidelined as a result.\nCareer in the United States (1806\u20131815).\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, (later known as \"Clermont\"). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and up the Hudson River to the state capital &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;. \"Clermont\" made the trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the maiden voyage included a lawyer Jones and his family from &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; nurse on a steamboat hospital in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Canal%20Commission\"&gt;Erie Canal Commission&lt;/a&gt;, appointed by the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Governor of New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nFulton's final design was the &lt;a href=\"floating%20battery\"&gt;floating battery&lt;/a&gt; . This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Roosevelt%20%28inventor%29\"&gt;Nicholas Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, , sturdy enough to take down the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; rivers to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana. It traveled from industrial &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, where it was built, with stops at &lt;a href=\"Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Wheeling, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cincinnati, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;; past the \"&lt;a href=\"Falls%20of%20the%20Ohio\"&gt;Falls of the Ohio&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;; to near &lt;a href=\"Cairo%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Cairo, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Natchez%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Natchez, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, to New Orleans some by river from the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20Territory\"&gt;Louisiana Territory&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\nFulton was elected a member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Antiquarian%20Society\"&gt;American Antiquarian Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1814.\nPersonal life.\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Livingston\"&gt;Walter Livingston&lt;/a&gt; and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era. Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician. Together, they had four children:\nFulton died in 1815 in New York City from &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; (then known as \"consumption\"). He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Addis%20Emmet\"&gt;Thomas Addis Emmet&lt;/a&gt;, fell through the ice. In rescuing his friend, Fulton got soaked with icy water. He is believed to have contracted &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. When he got home, his sickness worsened. He was diagnosed with consumption and died at 49 years old. After his death, his widow remarried to Charles Augustus Dale on November 26, 1816.\nHe is buried in the &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Church%20Cemetery\"&gt;Trinity Church Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Trinity Church (Episcopal)&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, near other notable Americans such as former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury\"&gt;U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Hamilton\"&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Gallatin\"&gt;Albert Gallatin&lt;/a&gt;. His descendants include &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Lidle\"&gt;Cory Lidle&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; pitcher.\nLegacy.\nPosthumous honors.\nThe Commonwealth of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; donated a &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Fulton%20%28Roberts%29\"&gt;marble statue of Fulton&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Statuary%20Hall%20Collection\"&gt;National Statuary Hall Collection&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Capitol\"&gt;United States Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. Fulton was also honored for his development of &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt; technology in New York City's &lt;a href=\"Hudson-Fulton%20Celebration\"&gt;Hudson-Fulton Celebration&lt;/a&gt; of the Centennial in 1909. A replica of his first steam-powered steam vessel, \"Clermont\", was built for the occasion.\nFive ships of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; have borne the name in honor of Robert Fulton.\nFulton Hall at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine%20Academy\"&gt;United States Merchant Marine Academy&lt;/a&gt; houses the Department of Marine Engineering and included laboratories for diesel and steam engineering, refrigeration, marine engineering, thermodynamics, materials testing, machine shop, mechanical engineering, welding, electrical machinery, control systems, electric circuits, engine room simulators and graphics.\nBronze statues of Fulton and &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; represent commerce on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson%20Building\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson Building&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Capitol%20Hill\"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; They are two of 16 historical figures, each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization.\nThe Guatemalan government in 1910 erected a bust of Fulton in one of the parks of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala%20City\"&gt;Guatemala City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2006, Fulton was inducted into the \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Inventors%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;National Inventors Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Alexandria%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Alexandria, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaces named for Fulton.\nMany places in the U.S. are named for Robert Fulton, including:\nIn popular culture.\n&lt;a href=\"20th%20Century-Fox\"&gt;20th Century-Fox&lt;/a&gt;'s 1940 film, \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Old%20New%20York\"&gt;Little Old New York&lt;/a&gt;\", based on a 1920 play by &lt;a href=\"Rida%20Johnson%20Young\"&gt;Rida Johnson Young&lt;/a&gt;, is a fictionalized version of Fulton's life from his arrival in New York to the first sailing of \"Clermont\". British actor &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Greene\"&gt;Richard Greene&lt;/a&gt; starred as Fulton with Brenda Joyce as Harriet Livingston. &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Faye\"&gt;Alice Faye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fred%20MacMurray\"&gt;Fred MacMurray&lt;/a&gt; played wharf friends who help Fulton overcome problems to realize his dream.\nA fictionalized account of Fulton's role was produced by &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; television during the 1960s. In the first serial, \"Triton\" (1961, re-made in 1968), two British naval officers, Captain Belwether and Lieutenant Lamb, are involved in spying on Fulton while he is working for the French. In the sequel, \"Pegasus\" (1969), they are surprised to find themselves working with Fulton, played by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Cawdron\"&gt;Robert Cawdron&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1961 version, Fulton was played by &lt;a href=\"Reed%20De%20Rouen\"&gt;Reed De Rouen&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Robert Fulton cartoon character appears in the 1955 &lt;a href=\"Casper%20the%20Friendly%20Ghost\"&gt;Casper the Friendly Ghost&lt;/a&gt; short film \"Red, White, and Boo\".\nAuthor &lt;a href=\"James%20McGee%20%28author%29\"&gt;James McGee&lt;/a&gt; used Fulton's experiments in early submarine warfare (against wooden warships) as a major plot element in his 2006 novel \"Ratcatcher\"\n\"Invasion\" (2009), the tenth novel in the \"Kydd\" naval warfare series by &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Stockwin\"&gt;Julian Stockwin&lt;/a&gt;, uses Fulton and his submarine as an important plot element.\nUntil 2016, &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Springs\"&gt;Disney Springs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20World\"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt; had a restaurant named Fulton's Crab House with a building in the shape of a steamboat."
