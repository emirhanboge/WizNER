    "text": "Thomas Fowler (16 December 1924 \u2013 3 May 2009) was an English &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played 17 seasons for &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt; as a left-winger, and is the club's all-time appearance record holder, having played 521 &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; games for the club, and 585 first-team games in all competitions.\nA native of &lt;a href=\"Prescot\"&gt;Prescot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, Fowler began his football career as an amateur on the books of &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;, and had played a few wartime games for Everton before he was called up to serve in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. He was wounded in France, and it was while recovering at a hospital in &lt;a href=\"Bedford\"&gt;Bedford&lt;/a&gt; that he met Northampton coach Jack Jennings, who invited him to join the Cobblers.\nFowler signed for Northampton in March 1945, and held on to the number 11 shirt for the next 15 years, playing more than 500 games for the club. In 1960, he began losing his place in the team to youngster &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Lines\"&gt;Barry Lines&lt;/a&gt;, and in December 1961 he was allowed to move to &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt;. Fowler spent two partial seasons at Aldershot, before retiring from the game in late 1962. He settled in Northampton after his retirement from football, and died in May 2009, aged 84."
