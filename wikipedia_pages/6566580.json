    "text": "UniMatch refers to a design patented by &lt;a href=\"Sony\"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; for stereo &lt;a href=\"headphones\"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the cord to end in either a 1/8\" or a 1/4\" &lt;a href=\"Phone%20connector%20%28audio%29\"&gt;jack&lt;/a&gt;. This is accomplished by using a 1/8\" connector with threading around the base hardwired to the cable, upon which the 1/4\" connector can be affixed."
