    "text": "The Reverend Walter Whiter (30 October 1758 in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20England\"&gt;Birmingham, England&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 23 July 1832 in &lt;a href=\"Hardingham\"&gt;Hardingham&lt;/a&gt;) was an English &lt;a href=\"philologist\"&gt;philologist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"literary%20critic\"&gt;literary critic&lt;/a&gt;. He is known for his 1794 work \"A Specimen of a Commentary on &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakspeare&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Specimen\", which explored \"&lt;a href=\"As%20You%20Like%20It\"&gt;As You Like It&lt;/a&gt;\" in terms of &lt;a href=\"John%20Locke\"&gt;John Locke&lt;/a&gt;'s philosophy of &lt;a href=\"associationism\"&gt;associationism&lt;/a&gt;, has been described as the first work of literary criticism to use scientific &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to his literary criticism, Whiter published his &lt;a href=\"etymology\"&gt;etymological&lt;/a&gt; research, first as \"Etymologicon Magnum\" in 1800, then as \"Etymologicon Universale\" in 1822 (vol. 1 and 2) and 1825 (vol. 3); August Baron Merian, a correspondent of &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Butler%20%28schoolmaster%29\"&gt;Samuel Butler&lt;/a&gt;, stated that he \"pit(ied)\" Whiter, and described him as \"(a) great etymologist\u2014perhaps the greatest that ever lived. A genius certainly; but it seems, like most eminent\nartists, &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Adissolute\"&gt;dissolute&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWhiter's linguistic studies\u2014in particular, his research into the language used by &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people\"&gt;Gypsies&lt;/a&gt;\u2014led him to be cited as a role model by &lt;a href=\"George%20Borrow\"&gt;George Borrow&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that Whiter appears in Borrow's \"&lt;a href=\"Lavengro\"&gt;Lavengro&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"Reverend Whiter the philologist\". The book includes a song about his character, which goes as follows:\nFor several decades, Whiter's notes on the vocabulary of &lt;a href=\"Romani%20language\"&gt;Romani&lt;/a&gt; were thought to have been lost, but were rediscovered and published in 1909 as \"Whiter's 'Lingua Cingariana'\".\nPersonal life.\nWhiter was a friend of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Porson\"&gt;Richard Porson&lt;/a&gt;, who had a habit of adding &lt;a href=\"marginalia\"&gt;marginalia&lt;/a&gt; to books which Whiter owned; many of these annotations were subsequently collected and published independently."
