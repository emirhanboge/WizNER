    "text": "Charles Owen Dexter (1862\u20131943) was an American &lt;a href=\"rhododendron\"&gt;rhododendron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybridizer&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; \"Rhododendron fortunei\", he produced hybrids characterized by dense &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;foliage&lt;/a&gt;, large stature and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s of superior size and color, many of which were also fragrant. Notable examples of his work include Scintillation, Betty Hume, Parker's Pink, GiGi, Mrs. W.R. Coe, Wheatley and Westbury.\nBetween 1921 and 1943 Dexter carried on a massive breeding program at his estate in &lt;a href=\"Sandwich%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. There he produced between 5,000 and 10,000 seedlings annually and gave thousands of plantings away to private gardens, nurseries and public botanical collections.\nHis estate is now operated as the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20Museums%20and%20Gardens\"&gt;Heritage Museums and Gardens&lt;/a&gt; which contains plantings of 125 of the known 145 Dexter cultivars."
