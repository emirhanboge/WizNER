    "text": "Iris albomarginata is a species in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Iris%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Iris&lt;/a&gt;\", in the subgenus &lt;a href=\"Iris%20subg.%20Scorpiris\"&gt;\"Scorpiris\"&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"bulbous\"&gt;bulbous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt;, from the mountains in the former &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; states of &lt;a href=\"Kyrgyzstan\"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tajikistan\"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIt has bright blue flowers with a white crest. It sometimes has yellow marks on the crest. The falls area white with a yellow centre.\nIt has 2-5 flowers on a short stem.\nIt flowers in March\u2013April.\nIt has smooth dark green leaves between 1 and 2\u00a0cm wide and the plant reaches 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft) in height. It also has a bright white edging to all the leaves. The stem is just visible behind the leaves.\nTaxonomy.\nIt was first described by (Russian botanist &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Fedtschenko\"&gt;Boris Fedtschenko&lt;/a&gt;) in Bulletin de &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Edmond%20Boissier\"&gt;l'Herbier Boissier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33641879\"&gt;page 917&lt;/a&gt; in 1904. But it was called \"Iris coerulea\". When &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Foster%20%28physiologist%29\"&gt;Foster&lt;/a&gt; was working on irises, he found that \"Iris coerulea\" was used to name an \"&lt;a href=\"Iris%20pumila\"&gt;Iris pumila&lt;/a&gt;\" hybrid. He then renamed the iris as \"Iris albomarginata\" because the leaves of the iris had a white edging. This edging was a characteristic of several of the species in the \"Scorpiris\" subgenus section of irises.\nIt was then re-published as \"Iris albomarginata\" in 'Contributions from the &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University%20Herbaria\"&gt;Gray Herbarium&lt;/a&gt;' of &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1936.\n\"Iris albomarginata\" is an accepted name by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horticultural%20Society\"&gt;RHS&lt;/a&gt;.\nNative.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; (within the &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Shan\"&gt;Tien Shan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fergana%20Range\"&gt;Fergana mountains&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Alay%20Mountains\"&gt;Alayskiy&lt;/a&gt; in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It is found on the clay and stone foothills at 2000m above sea level.\nCultivation.\nIt is &lt;a href=\"Hardiness%20%28plants%29\"&gt;hardy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"USDA\"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt; Zone: 4.\nIn the UK, it is better grown in an &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20house\"&gt;Alpine house&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bulb%20frame\"&gt;bulb frame&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral specimens can be found in &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Garden%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPropagation.\nIrises can generally be propagated by &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28horticulture%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;, or by seed growing.\nToxicity.\nLike many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction."
