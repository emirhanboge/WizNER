    "text": "Kevin Roantree O'Shiel (1891 \u2013 1970) was an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20people\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; politician and civil servant.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Omagh\"&gt;Omagh&lt;/a&gt;, O'Shiel studied at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20St%20Mary%27s%20College\"&gt;Mount St Mary's College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, then at &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%20Dublin\"&gt;Trinity College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Inns\"&gt;King's Inns&lt;/a&gt;. He qualified as a barrister in 1913, but devoted much of his time to championing &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Home%20Rule\"&gt;Irish Home Rule&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Volunteers\"&gt;Irish Volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, but did not take part in the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Rising\"&gt;Easter Rising&lt;/a&gt;, as he believed that Catholicism was incompatible with taking secret oaths, which would have been necessary to join any of the participating groups. Instead, in 1916, O'Shiel joined the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Anti-Partition%20League\"&gt;Irish Anti-Partition League&lt;/a&gt;, and the following year became a member of &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt;.\nO'Shiel was the &lt;a href=\"election%20agent\"&gt;election agent&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Griffith\"&gt;Arthur Griffith&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1918%20East%20Cavan%20by-election\"&gt;1918 East Cavan by-election&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"1918%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1918 Irish general election&lt;/a&gt;, he himself stood in &lt;a href=\"South%20Antrim%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;South Antrim&lt;/a&gt;. One of the least promising constituencies in the country for Sinn F\u00e9in, he took 14.9% of the votes cast. He was also drafted at the last minute to stand in &lt;a href=\"North%20Fermanagh%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;North Fermanagh&lt;/a&gt;; original Sinn F\u00e9in nominee George Irvine lost a pan-nationalist nominating convention to an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party\"&gt;Irish Parliamentary Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate and decided that he would therefore withdraw. In the event, his only opponent in North Fermanagh was from the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Unionist%20Party\"&gt;Irish Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;; O'Shiel took 47.9% of the vote, narrowly missing out on election.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Irish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, O'Shiel was involved in drawing up the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Constitution of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and liaised with the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;League of Nations&lt;/a&gt; to successfully negotiating the admission of Ireland. In 1920, he was appointed as a &lt;a href=\"judge\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt; in the D\u00e1il land courts; through this, he served on the Land Settlement Commission, and occasionally acted as a circuit judge. He and &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Maguire\"&gt;Conor Maguire&lt;/a&gt; were the first two judges to be appointed by the D\u00e1il.\nO'Shiel stood unsuccessfully for Sinn F\u00e9in in &lt;a href=\"Fermanagh%20and%20Tyrone%20%28Northern%20Ireland%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Fermanagh and Tyrone&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1921%20Northern%20Ireland%20general%20election\"&gt;1921 Northern Ireland general election&lt;/a&gt;, then afterwards devoted his time to activities in the South. He served as assistant legal advisor to the Irish government in 1922\u201323, and as director of the North Eastern Boundary Bureau from 1922 to 1925. From 1923, he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Land%20Commission\"&gt;Irish Land Commission&lt;/a&gt;, on which he served for forty years.\nO'Shiel wrote a number of books, including \"The Rise of the Irish Nation League\" in 1916, \"The Making of a Republic\" in 1920, \"The Land Problem in Ireland and its Settlement\" in 1954, and several \"&lt;a href=\"Irish%20Times\"&gt;Irish Times&lt;/a&gt;\" articles on his experiences in 1966.\nHis daughter, &lt;a href=\"Eda%20Sagarra\"&gt;Eda Sagarra&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a biography of her father: \"Kevin O'Shiel: Northern Nationalist and Irish-State Builder\" (issued 2013)."
