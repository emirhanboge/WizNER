    "text": "The Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet () was an operation which transferred the ships of the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Fleet\"&gt;Baltic Fleet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Russian Navy&lt;/a&gt; from their bases at &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;, at the time known as Reval (), and &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kronstadt\"&gt;Kronstadt&lt;/a&gt; in 1918.\nOperation.\nOn 17 February 1918 &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt; ordered the ships of the Baltic Fleet to leave their bases at &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; and sail to &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. On 19 February, due to a new German offensive, the Baltic Fleet ordered the further transfer of ships located in Helsinki to &lt;a href=\"Kronstadt\"&gt;Kronstadt&lt;/a&gt;. On the same day ships started leaving Tallinn. A general evacuation began on 22 February, with a group of four ships, led by the icebreaker &lt;a href=\"Yermak%20%281898%20icebreaker%29\"&gt;\"Yermak\"&lt;/a&gt;, departing for Helsinki. They were followed on 24 February by a convoy of transport ships, accompanied by two submarines, three &lt;a href=\"minesweeper\"&gt;minesweeper&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time German troops entered Reval on 25 February, most of the Russian ships had already left, escorted by the &lt;a href=\"icebreaker\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;s \"Yermak\", \"&lt;a href=\"Tarmo%20%281907%20icebreaker%29\"&gt;Tarmo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Suur%20T%C3%B5ll%20%28icebreaker%29\"&gt;Volynets&lt;/a&gt;\". The operation, superintended by &lt;a href=\"Alexey%20Schastny\"&gt;Alexey Schastny&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in evacuating the bulk of the Baltic Fleet to Helsinki, where all of the ships had arrived by 5 March, with the exception of the submarine \"&lt;a href=\"Edinorog\"&gt;Edinorog&lt;/a&gt;\", which had been crushed by ice.\nOn 12\u201313 April, German forces captured Helsinki. Russian sailors scuttled four submarines in &lt;a href=\"Hanko%2C%20Finland\"&gt;Hanko&lt;/a&gt; harbour on 3 April, just before the 10,000-strong German &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea%20Division\"&gt;Baltic Sea Division&lt;/a&gt; landed in support of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;White Guard&lt;/a&gt;. The submarines\u2014&lt;a href=\"Russian%20submarine%20AG-11\"&gt;\"AG 11\"&lt;/a&gt;, , \"AG 15\" and \u2014were made by &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20Electric%20Boat\"&gt;Electric Boat Co.&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The German Army later returned all of the ships captured in Helsinki under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk\"&gt;treaty of Brest-Litovsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of the evacuated ships had reached Kronstadt or &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Petrograd&lt;/a&gt; by 22 April.\nImportance.\nThe ships transferred included:\nTwo &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt;s and large amounts of military equipment were also transferred. The transferred ships went on to play an important role in the defence of Petrograd."
