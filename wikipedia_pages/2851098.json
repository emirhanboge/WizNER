    "text": "The Subalpine Republic was a short-lived &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; that existed between 1800 and 1802 on the territory of &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; during its military rule by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPiedmont was the main part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia\"&gt;Kingdom of Sardinia&lt;/a&gt; which, despite its name, had its core on the mainland. The kingdom suffered a first French invasion in 1796, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281796%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Savoy\"&gt;Savoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nice\"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt;. After a second invasion in 1798, King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Emmanuel%20IV%20of%20Sardinia\"&gt;Charles Emmanuel IV&lt;/a&gt; escaped to Rome, but he never agreed to sign a new peace treaty, approving a final arrangement of its continental territories according to international law.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Piedmontese%20Republic\"&gt;Piedmontese Republic&lt;/a&gt; was declared on 10 September 1798 and it existed until 20 June 1799, when it was conquered by Austro-Russian troops. Although the Kingdom of Sardinia's authority was briefly restored in Piedmont, in 1800 Napoleon returned to Italy, taking back much of the new republics. The Piedmontese Republic was re-established as the Subalpine Republic on 20 June 1800.\nThe republic had its capital at &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;. On 9 July 1800, it adopted a new flag, which consisted of a red-blue-gold triband (based on the flag of the earlier &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Alba\"&gt;Republic of Alba&lt;/a&gt;). Its motto was \"Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9\", which was taken from the French motto \"&lt;a href=\"Libert%C3%A9%2C%20%C3%A9galit%C3%A9%2C%20fraternit%C3%A9\"&gt;Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Subalpine Republic was heavily dependent on France and was never really independent as it was under French &lt;a href=\"military%20occupation\"&gt;military occupation&lt;/a&gt;. The state was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20states%20with%20limited%20recognition\"&gt;not recognized&lt;/a&gt; by the international community. Its government changed a number of times during its brief existence, and was made up of the following people:\nParis introduced French-style reforms within the Subalpine Republic. It used the &lt;a href=\"French%20franc\"&gt;French franc&lt;/a&gt;, and also minted its own coins.\nIn March 1801, the Piedmontese Army was incorporated into the French Army, and a few months later the administrative management of the region ended up completely in French hands. On 4 June 1802, Charles Emmanuel abdicated in favour of his brother &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Emmanuel%20I%20of%20Sardinia\"&gt;Victor Emmanuel I&lt;/a&gt;, who was in &lt;a href=\"Cagliari\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; naval protection. Napoleon took this opportunity to declare the forfeiture of the old sovereignty over Piedmont, and plans were made to annex it to France.\nThe Subalpine Republic ceased to exist on 11 September 1802, when it was divided between the &lt;a href=\"French%20First%20Republic\"&gt;French Republic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republic%20%28Napoleonic%29\"&gt;Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt;. The French Republic annexed the &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9partements\"&gt;d\u00e9partements&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Doire%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Doire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marengo%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Marengo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"P%C3%B4%20%28department%29\"&gt;P\u00f4&lt;/a&gt; (briefly named \"\u00c9ridan\", after &lt;a href=\"Eridanos%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Eridanos&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Sesia%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Sesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stura\"&gt;Stura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tanaro%20%28department%29\"&gt;Tanaro&lt;/a&gt;, while the Italian Republic annexed &lt;a href=\"Novara\"&gt;Novara&lt;/a&gt; (as the department of &lt;a href=\"Agogna\"&gt;Agogna&lt;/a&gt;). In 1805, the Italian Republic became the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt;."
