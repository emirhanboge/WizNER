    "text": "North Carolina State University (NC State) is a &lt;a href=\"public%20university\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Land-grant%20university\"&gt;land-grant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research%20university\"&gt;research university&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1887 and part of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; system, it is the largest university in the &lt;a href=\"Carolinas\"&gt;Carolinas&lt;/a&gt;. The university forms one of the corners of the &lt;a href=\"Research%20Triangle\"&gt;Research Triangle&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Classification%20of%20Institutions%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;North Carolina General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; established the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now NC State, on March 7, 1887, originally as a &lt;a href=\"land-grant%20university\"&gt;land-grant college&lt;/a&gt;. The college underwent several name changes and officially became North Carolina State University at Raleigh in 1965, and by longstanding convention, the \"at Raleigh\" portion was omitted. Today, NC State has an enrollment of more than 35,000 students, making it among the largest in the country. NC State has historical strengths in &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"life%20sciences\"&gt;life sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"textiles\"&gt;textiles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"design\"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; and offers &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;s in 106 fields of study. The graduate school offers &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degrees\"&gt;master's degrees&lt;/a&gt; in 104 fields, &lt;a href=\"PhDs\"&gt;doctoral&lt;/a&gt; degrees in 61 fields, and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.\nNC State athletic teams are known as the &lt;a href=\"NC%20State%20Wolfpack\"&gt;Wolfpack&lt;/a&gt;. The name was adopted in 1922 when a disgruntled fan described the behavior of the student body at athletic events as being \"like a wolf pack.\" They compete in &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;NCAA Division I&lt;/a&gt; and have won eight national championships: two &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; championships, two &lt;a href=\"AIAW\"&gt;AIAW&lt;/a&gt; championships, and four titles under other sanctioning bodies.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;North Carolina General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; founded NC State on March 7, 1887 as a &lt;a href=\"land-grant%20university\"&gt;land-grant college&lt;/a&gt; under the name \"North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts,\" or \"North Carolina A&amp;M\" for short. In the segregated system, it was open only to white students. As a land-grant college, North Carolina A&amp;M would provide a liberal and practical education while focusing on military tactics, agriculture, and the mechanical arts without excluding &lt;a href=\"classical%20education%20movement\"&gt;classical studies&lt;/a&gt;. Since its founding, the university has maintained these objectives while building on them. After opening in 1889, North Carolina A&amp;M saw its enrollment fluctuate and its mandate expand. In 1917, it changed its name to \"North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering\"\u2014or \"North Carolina State\" for short. During the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, the North Carolina state government, under &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O.%20Max%20Gardner\"&gt;O. Max Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, administratively combined the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, the Woman's College (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Greensboro\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Greensboro&lt;/a&gt;), and NC State. This conglomeration became the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. In 1937 &lt;a href=\"Blake%20R%20Van%20Leer\"&gt;Blake R Van Leer&lt;/a&gt; joined as Dean and started the graduate program for engineering. Following World War II, the university grew and developed. The &lt;a href=\"G.I.%20Bill\"&gt;G.I. Bill&lt;/a&gt; enabled thousands of veterans to attend college, and enrollment shot past the 5,000 mark in 1947.\nState College created new academic programs, including the School of Architecture and Landscape Design in 1947 (renamed as the School of Design in 1948), the School of Education in 1948, and the School of Forestry in 1950. In the summer of 1956, following the US Supreme Court ruling in \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954) that segregated public education was unconstitutional, North Carolina State College enrolled its first African-American undergraduates, Ed Carson, Manuel Crockett, Irwin Holmes, and Walter Holmes. In 1962, State College officials desired to change the institution's name to North Carolina State University. Consolidated university administrators approved a change to the University of North Carolina at Raleigh, frustrating many students and &lt;a href=\"Alumnus\"&gt;alumni&lt;/a&gt; who protested the change with letter writing campaigns. In 1963, State College officially became North Carolina State of the University of North Carolina. Students, faculty, and alumni continued to express dissatisfaction with this name, however, and after two additional years of protest, the name was changed to the current North Carolina State University at Raleigh. However, by longstanding convention, the \"at Raleigh\" portion is omitted, and the shorter names \"North Carolina State University\" and \"NC State University\" are accepted on first reference in news stories. Indeed, school officials discourage using \"at Raleigh\" except when absolutely necessary, as the full name implies that there is another branch of the university elsewhere in the state.\nIn 1966, single-year enrollment reached 10,000. In the 1970s enrollment surpassed 19,000 and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences was added.\nCelebrating its centennial in 1987, NC State reorganized its internal structure, renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20College%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;College of Engineering&lt;/a&gt;). Also in this year, it gained of land that was developed as &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Campus%20of%20North%20Carolina%20State%20University\"&gt;Centennial Campus&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus. It has invested more than $620 million in facilities and infrastructure at the new campus, with of space being constructed. Sixty-one private and government agency partners are located on Centennial Campus.\nNC State has almost 8,000 employees, nearly 35,000 students, a $1.495\u00a0billion annual budget, and a $1.4\u00a0billion endowment. It is the largest university in the state and one of the anchors of North Carolina's &lt;a href=\"Research%20Triangle\"&gt;Research Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2009, NCSU canceled a planned appearance by the &lt;a href=\"14th%20Dalai%20Lama\"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt; to speak on its Raleigh campus, citing concerns about a &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; backlash and a shortage of time and resources.\nNCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center, located in &lt;a href=\"D.H.%20Hill%20Library\"&gt;D.H. Hill Library&lt;/a&gt;, maintains a website devoted to NC State history entitled \"Historical State\".\nCampuses.\nMain campus.\nNC State's Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Railroad\"&gt;North Carolina Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and &lt;a href=\"Reynolds%20Coliseum\"&gt;Reynolds Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red brick buildings. Brick statues dot the landscape and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Brickyard%20%28NC%20State%29\"&gt;University Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, colloquially named \"The Brickyard\", in North Campus is nicknamed for its paving material, most sidewalks are also made from brick. The Brickyard and sidewalks also contain white brick mosaics of the athletics logo and other patterns.\nThe &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20Memorial%20Bell%20Tower\"&gt;Memorial Bell Tower&lt;/a&gt;, located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Chancellor's Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in World War I. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115\u00a0feet (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Belltower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Court of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, just west of the Memorial Bell Tower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every &lt;a href=\"County%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;), but damage caused by &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Fran\"&gt;Hurricane Fran&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court's former appearance is far from being restored.\nSouthwest of the Court of North Carolina is another landmark, the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20Free%20Expression%20Tunnel\"&gt;Free Expression Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. The Tunnel functions as one of three pedestrian tunnels underneath the railroad tracks separating North Campus and Central Campus. This particular tunnel is the site of sanctioned &lt;a href=\"graffiti\"&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt;; anyone may paint there, and it is often the place for political statements, personal messages, and art. This tunnel also serves as a way to advertise events going on around campus. In 2008 racist and threatening graffiti directed at (then) President-elect &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; prompted an investigation from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secret%20Service\"&gt;United States Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;. Students held a \"Unity Rally\" in response to denounce the acts of racism.\nCentennial.\nNC State's main campus is augmented by the mixed-use Centennial Campus. Located south of the Memorial Tower, this campus houses university, corporate, and government research, in addition to classrooms and non-student residences. The Wilson College of Textiles has been based on this campus since 1991. Beginning in 2002, the College of Engineering began to relocate to Centennial Campus. Six of the nine College of Engineering departments are housed in three Engineering Buildings in an area known as the Engineering Oval. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20LEAF%20Biomanufacturing%20Training%20and%20Education%20Center\"&gt;Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center&lt;/a&gt; (BTEC), part of the College of Engineering, is located adjacent to the Engineering Oval. The offices of &lt;a href=\"ABB%20Group\"&gt;ABB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LexisNexis\"&gt;LexisNexis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Weather%20Service\"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; are also on the Centennial Campus, as well as &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Campus%20Magnet%20Middle%20School%20%28Raleigh%2C%20NC%29\"&gt;Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentennial Biomedical Campus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20Centennial%20Biomedical%20Campus\"&gt;North Carolina State University Centennial Biomedical Campus&lt;/a&gt; is located west of the NCSU Memorial Tower. &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20College%20of%20Veterinary%20Medicine\"&gt;North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, NC State's professional college and North Carolina's only &lt;a href=\"veterinary%20medicine\"&gt;veterinary medicine&lt;/a&gt; program, serves as the anchor of the Biomedical Campus. The campus consists of 20 buildings including the CVM Research Building where biomedical investigations in genomic sciences; vaccine development; cancer immuno-therapy; emerging and infectious zoonotic diseases; and diseases of the lung, &lt;a href=\"respiratory%20tract\"&gt;respiratory tract&lt;/a&gt;, skin, and digestive system are undertaken. The Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with its clinical research and clinical trials, and the Teaching Animal Unit (TAU), which is a working farm, are also campus elements. The 110,000-square-foot Randall B. Terry, Jr. Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center, completed in 2011, doubled the size of the veterinary hospital.\n&lt;a href=\"J.%20C.%20Raulston%20Arboretum\"&gt;J. C. Raulston Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"arboretum\"&gt;arboretum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt; operated by NC State, and located just south of West Campus. It is open daily without charge.\nN.C. Research Campus.\nNC State is one of eight universities with a presence at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Research%20Campus\"&gt;North Carolina Research Campus&lt;/a&gt;, a 340-acre biotechnology hub in &lt;a href=\"Kannapolis\"&gt;Kannapolis&lt;/a&gt;, N.C. The university operates the &lt;a href=\"Plants%20for%20Human%20Health%20Institute\"&gt;Plants for Human Health Institute&lt;/a&gt; (PHHI), a research and education organization devoted to research involving food crops, like fruits and vegetables, and the potential health-promoting properties they convey when consumed. NC State's &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20College%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Life%20Sciences\"&gt;College of Agriculture and Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt; staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.\nPHHI has both research and &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20Extension\"&gt;Cooperative Extension&lt;/a&gt; components. &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Ann%20Lila\"&gt;Dr. Mary Ann Lila&lt;/a&gt; is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute. As of May 2014, PHHI is home to around 50 faculty and staff at the N.C. Research Campus.\nN.C. State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the fledgling biotech hub that would become the N.C. Research Campus. The university's program was renamed the Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was officially dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order \"to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease.\"\nSustainability.\nIn March 2008, NC State launched the University Sustainability Office in order to address environmental concerns on campus. The university has established a commitment to reduce its annual energy consumption per square foot by at least 4% over a 10-year period. In addition, the university has surpassed the Executive Order 156 goal of diverting 40 percent of their solid waste stream from the landfill through a variety of campus reuse and recycling programs. NC State incorporates locally grown, organic, and free range foods into dining service meals at several events such as Earth Week's EarthFest and the annual All Carolinas Meal with foods local to the Carolinas. Examinations of the campus' sustainability practices by the Sustainable Endowments Institute resulted in a \"B+\" grade for NC State on the College Sustainability Report Card 2011. In 2013 the University Housing department agreed to incorporate a new living and learning community known as \"EcoVillage.\" Members of EcoVillage are housed in Bragaw Dormitory located on West Campus. Members of EcoVillage complete numerous volunteer based sustainability trips every semester and attend various discussions about how to improve and further the university's reach into sustainability.\nAcademics.\nStructure.\nNC State is one of 17 institutions that constitute the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; system. Each campus has a high degree of independence, but each submits to the policies of the UNC system Board of Governors. The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four-year terms. President &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20W.%20Ross\"&gt;Thomas W. Ross&lt;/a&gt; heads the system.\nThe Board of Trustees of NC State has thirteen members and sets all policies for the university. The UNC system Board of Governors elects eight of the trustees and the Governor of North Carolina appoints four. The student body president serves on the Board of Trustees as a voting member. The UNC system also elects the Chancellor of NC State, currently Randy Woodson.\nThe Board of Trustees administers NC State's eleven academic &lt;a href=\"colleges\"&gt;colleges&lt;/a&gt;. Each college grants its own degrees with the exception of the First Year College which provides incoming freshmen the opportunity to experience several disciplines before selecting a major. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20College%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Life%20Sciences\"&gt;College of Agriculture and Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt; is the only college to offer &lt;a href=\"associate%27s%20degrees\"&gt;associate's degrees&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20College%20of%20Veterinary%20Medicine\"&gt;College of Veterinary Medicine&lt;/a&gt; does not grant undergraduate degrees. Each college is composed of numerous &lt;a href=\"Academic%20department\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt; that focus on a particular discipline or degree program, for example &lt;a href=\"Food%20science\"&gt;Food Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Civil%20engineering\"&gt;Civil Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genetics\"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Accounting\"&gt;Accounting&lt;/a&gt;. There are a total of 66 departments administered by all eleven NC State colleges.\nIn total, NC State offers nine &lt;a href=\"associate%27s%20degree\"&gt;associate's degree&lt;/a&gt;s in agriculture, &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;s in 102 areas of study, master's degrees in 108 areas and &lt;a href=\"doctorate%20degree\"&gt;doctorate degree&lt;/a&gt;s in 60 areas. NC State is known for its programs in agriculture, engineering, textiles, and design. The textile and &lt;a href=\"paper%20engineering\"&gt;paper engineering&lt;/a&gt; programs are notable, given the uniqueness of the subject area.\nAcademic divisions.\n, NC State have the following colleges and academic departments:\nAdmission.\nConsidered a \"more selective\" university, NC State accepts about half of those who apply for undergraduate admission. For the class of 2019, 21,104 applied and 10,584, or 50%, were accepted, of whom 4,210 enrolled.\nMembers of the class of 2019 had average SAT verbal, math and writing scores of 610, 640 and 587, respectively, for a two-part total (verbal and math) of 1250 (1600-point scale) or a three-part total of 1836 (2400-point scale). The 4,210 students who enrolled had an average high school GPA of 3.44; 40%, or 1,677, ranked in the top 10% of their graduating classes. There were 130 valedictorians and 102 salutatorians in the class.\nTransfer admission is also very competitive. In the fall of 2015, 4,165 students applied to the transfer class; 1,470, or 35%, were admitted.\nNC State requires undergraduate admission candidates to choose a preferred college of study. After determining that an applicant meets the overall university requirements, the individual college must also agree to accept the student. Because of this process, some colleges have significantly higher admission requirements than others.\nThe Graduate School reviews all postgraduate education applications. For fall 2015, 14,394 prospective students applied to the Graduate School; 3,460 (24%) were admitted. Of these, 2,982 (80.3%) enrolled.\nThe Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) degree awarded by the Institute for Advanced Analytics is the university's most selective graduate program accepting around one-in-eight applicants.\nLibraries.\nNCSU Libraries, ranked 38th out of 115 North American research libraries, includes 4.4 million volumes, over 50,000 print and electronic serial subscriptions, more than 20,000 videos and film holdings, and more than 40,000 digital images (as of 2011). The library system has an annual budget of over $29 million and consists of five libraries, two main libraries and three branch libraries. The &lt;a href=\"D.%20H.%20Hill%20Library\"&gt;D. H. Hill Library&lt;/a&gt;, located on &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20State%20University%20Main%20Campus\"&gt;Main Campus&lt;/a&gt;, is over nine stories tall and covers over 119,000 square feet. This library is located on North Main Campus in the center of University Plaza, or often called \"The Brickyard\" and is 11,000 square meters. The &lt;a href=\"James%20B.%20Hunt%20Jr.%20Library\"&gt;James B. Hunt Jr. Library&lt;/a&gt;, located on the university's &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Campus%20of%20North%20Carolina%20State%20University\"&gt;Centennial Campus&lt;/a&gt;, opened in January 2013 and covers over 221,000 square feet. NC State, as a member of the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN), has interlibrary loan services with &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Central%20University\"&gt;North Carolina Central University&lt;/a&gt;.\nRankings and reputation.\nIn 2014 - 2015 NC State became part of only fifty-four institutions in the U.S. to have earned the \"Innovation and Economic Prosperity University\" designation by the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Public%20and%20Land-grant%20Universities\"&gt;Association of Public and Land-grant Universities&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor 2020, \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\" ranks NC State tied for 84th out of all national universities and tied for 34th out of public universities in the U.S., tied at 31st for \"most innovative\" and 69th for \"best value\" schools.\nNC State's College of Engineering was tied for 24th by \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\", with many of its programs ranking in the top 30 nationally. NC State's Nuclear Engineering program is considered to be one of the best in the world and in 2020, was ranked 3rd in the country (behind MIT and the University of Michigan Ann Arbor)\".\" The biological and &lt;a href=\"agricultural%20engineering\"&gt;agricultural engineering&lt;/a&gt; programs are also widely recognized and were ranked 4th nationally. In 2019 NC State's manufacturing and industrial engineering program was ranking 13th in the nation, and &lt;a href=\"Materials%20science\"&gt;material science&lt;/a&gt; at 15th. Other notable programs included civil engineering at 20th, environmental engineering tied at 21st, chemical engineering tied for 22nd, computer engineering at 28th, and biomedical engineering ranking 28th nationally in 2019.

In 2018, \"Fashion Schools\" ranked the college's &lt;a href=\"Fashion%20merchandising\"&gt;fashion and textile management&lt;/a&gt; program 11th in the nation.\nNC State's Masters program in &lt;a href=\"Analytics\"&gt;Data Analytics&lt;/a&gt; was the first in the United States. Launched in 2007, it is part of the Institute for Advanced Analytics and was created as a university-wide multidisciplinary initiative to meet the rapidly growing demand in the labor market for analytics professionals. In 2012, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20H.%20Davenport\"&gt;Thomas H. Davenport&lt;/a&gt; and D.J. Patil highlighted the MSA program in &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Business%20Review\"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; as one of only a few sources of talent with proven strengths in data science.\nNC State is known for its College of Veterinary Medicine and in 2020 it was ranked 4th nationally, by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", 25th internationally by NTU Ranking and 36th internationally by the Academic Ranking of World Universities.\nIn 2020, NC State's College of Design was ranked 25th by College Factual.
