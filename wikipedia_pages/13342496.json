    "text": "Arifur Rahman (born August 8, 1984) is a &lt;a href=\"Bangladeshis\"&gt;Bangladeshi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Norwegians\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; political &lt;a href=\"cartoonist\"&gt;cartoonist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"illustrator\"&gt;illustrator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"animator\"&gt;animator&lt;/a&gt;. He is a self-taught cartoonist who is renowned for his contribution to &lt;a href=\"cartoon\"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt;s both on the internet and in print media. In &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, he is best known as \"Cartoonist Arif\" for &lt;a href=\"anti-corruption\"&gt;anti-corruption&lt;/a&gt; cartoons. He's won multiple awards for Anti-Corruption cartoons from &lt;a href=\"Transparency%20International%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Transparency International Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Star%20%28Bangladesh%29\"&gt;Daily Star.&lt;/a&gt; He was the first and former guest cartoonist of &lt;a href=\"International%20Cities%20of%20Refuge%20Network\"&gt;International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN)&lt;/a&gt;. He is a publisher of cartoon magazine &lt;a href=\"Toons%20Mag\"&gt;Toons Mag&lt;/a&gt; and the organizer of international cartoon contests and exhibitions.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nArifur Rahman was born in a small village called Tetiar Kanda in &lt;a href=\"Shahjadpur%20Upazila\"&gt;Shahjadpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sirajganj%20District\"&gt;Sirajganj&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh. When Arifur Rahman was in the &lt;a href=\"Preschool\"&gt;Preschool&lt;/a&gt;, Arif's father left his wife and children and remarried. Arif's parents got divorced afterward and his &lt;a href=\"mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; went back to her family's village, taking Arif and his sister along. They were broke and his mother was &lt;a href=\"Depressed%20Mode\"&gt;depressed&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever she was to inherit from her father had already been given to her &lt;a href=\"husband\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt; in dowry, so she had nothing to get by. Arif, with his mother and sister, lived in a room with their &lt;a href=\"Grandparent\"&gt;grandmother&lt;/a&gt;. Arif's maternal grandfather was a pious man and had two &lt;a href=\"Wife\"&gt;wives&lt;/a&gt;. Arif's mother was among the children from his first &lt;a href=\"marriage\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;, but he had come to live with his second wife during those years. It meant he barely saw his first wife. Arif was enrolled in the a nearby school there.\nArif and his &lt;a href=\"family\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; struggled for &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. His mother started farming chickens for some pocket money. His &lt;a href=\"uncle\"&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"aunt\"&gt;aunt&lt;/a&gt;s helped out by &lt;a href=\"gift\"&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt;ing Arif's mother goat and sheep cubs and he used to take care of the &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; when he returned from school. Arif went to a village school back then, which was far away from his grandfather's house. Arif had to walk a very long way to go to school every day. Their village did not yet have access to electricity so, in the evening, he had to study by the tame flame of a kerosene lamp. He was a &lt;a href=\"Self-Taught\"&gt;self-taught&lt;/a&gt; cartoonist and started &lt;a href=\"drawing\"&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; at an early age. His first cartoon was published in 2004 in a satire magazine called Bichhu by the \"&lt;a href=\"Jugantor\"&gt;Daily Jugantor&lt;/a&gt;\". Every day, he drew cartoons and sent them to the newspapers for publishing. That is how he created a name for himself as a cartoonist.\nEducation.\nHe studied both in Bangladesh and in Norway.\nCareer.\nCartooning in Bangladesh.\nIn Bangladesh, he was famously known as \u201c\"Cartoonist Arif\".\u201d In April 2004, Arif's cartoon was published in the satire magazine, \u201c\"Bicchu\"\u201d under the\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Jugantor\"&gt;Daily Jugantor&lt;/a&gt;\". Since then, he has been drawing political satire cartoons and &lt;a href=\"comic%20strip\"&gt;comic strip&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s. He drew every day and sent his work off to newspapers. Almost all the daily newspapers in Bangladesh regularly published his cartoons back in the day. During 2004\u20132007, he drew a large number of cartoons for various Bangladeshi newspapers, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Jugantor\"&gt;The Daily Jugantar&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bhorer%20Kagoj\"&gt;Bhorer Kagoj&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Samakal\"&gt;Samakal&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Jaijaidin\"&gt;Jaijaidin&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Amar%20Desh\"&gt;Amar Desh&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Ittefaq\"&gt;Ittefaq&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Prothom%20Alo\"&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/a&gt;\". He was noticed by people and known as \"Cartoonist Arif\" around Bangladesh. He was recognized by fellow and legendary Bangladeshi cartoonists like &lt;a href=\"Rafiqun%20Nabi\"&gt;Rafiqun Nabi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shishir%20Bhattacharjee\"&gt;Shishir Bhattacharjee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ahsan%20Habib%20%28cartoonist%29\"&gt;Ahsan Habib&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, Rahman won the third prize in a contest titled Pin Hunt that was put on by \"The Daily Prothom Alo\"s periodical, \"Alpin (\u0986\u09b2\u09aa\u09bf\u09a8)\", and won third prize in the Anti-Corruption Cartoon Competition arranged by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) in 2006, as well as first prize in the Anti-Corruption Cartoon Competition arranged by &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Star%20%28Bangladesh%29\"&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 and in the same year, The Daily Prothom Alo appointed him to draw cartoons as a contributing cartoonist.\nCartoon controversy in Bangladesh.\nArifur Rahman's cartoons were regularly published in the satirical weekly supplement of &lt;a href=\"Prothom%20Alo\"&gt;The Daily Prothom Alo&lt;/a&gt;, Alpin, but the one published in the 17 September 17, 2007 edition stirred quite a bit of controversy. The cartoon features a conversation between a little boy and an older man. The apparently funny and harmless cartoon hurt a group of people's Islamic religious sentiments and Arif was sued for his cartoon. Some people led by acclaimed religious influencers chose to call for a nationwide strike in Bangladesh on the back of the incident. Alpin was discontinued and the editor, Sumanta Alam, was fired, effective immediately. The editor of The Daily Prothom Alo, &lt;a href=\"Matiur%20Rahman%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Matiur Rahman&lt;/a&gt; promised never to publish Arifur Rahman's cartoon in his newspaper again. And last, but not least, Arif was arrested at his Dhaka residence on September 18, 2007. He was arrested for being a \u201c&lt;a href=\"traitor\"&gt;traitor&lt;/a&gt;\u201d and for \u201c&lt;a href=\"Blasphemy%20law\"&gt;hurting the religious sentiments&lt;/a&gt;\u201d under the &lt;a href=\"blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; and emergency &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;law of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trial under Blasphemy Law.\nImprisoned on the &lt;a href=\"September%2018\"&gt;18th of September&lt;/a&gt;, 2007, Arifur Rahman stayed in prison for six months and 2 days. While in prison, Arif was heartbroken and felt very helpless. He felt wronged by his people and the country. He decided while sitting behind the bars that he would create a platform for the artists and art enthusiasts where they could express their talent and enjoy mindful art without any limitations or without the fear of being misunderstood, wrongfully judged or censored.\nOn 4 February 2008, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled Arif's detention illegal, dropped all charges brought against him and ordered his immediate release. But he was not released right away. He was finally freed on 20 March 2008, but the struggle continued for Arif as he found it hard to pursue his cartooning dreams like he used to. He could not continue his studies due to the scandal as universities would not admit him because of his &lt;a href=\"Controversy\"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; background. In 2009, another case was filed against him in a court in &lt;a href=\"Jessore%20District\"&gt;Jessore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt; for the very same cartoon published in 2007. The court in Jessore sentenced him to two months of rigorous imprisonment and fined him 500 Bangladeshi Taka, or another seven days in prison for impiety.\nMany Bangladeshi newspapers refused to publish any more of Arif's cartoons but some of them, the likes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Ittefaq\"&gt;The Daily Ittefaq&lt;/a&gt; and The Daily Prothom Alo, however, agreed to publish them under a &lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;pseudonym&lt;/a&gt;. Arif was disheartened with that turn of events. His desire to create an uncensorable cartooning platform only got stronger with these unpleasant incidents fanning the fire.\nIn 2010, the Government of Norway willingly granted Arif &lt;a href=\"Right%20of%20asylum\"&gt;political asylum&lt;/a&gt; as his life came to a standstill in Bangladesh and his life was under constant threat. Arif wanted to stay back in his beloved motherland but he was not able to because of his controversy, as he was labeled by his &lt;a href=\"2007%20Bangladesh%20cartoon%20controversy\"&gt;2007 scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Arif also came to fear for his life as one &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; after another kept on coming in all shapes and forms. He had no option but to &lt;a href=\"emigrate\"&gt;emigrate&lt;/a&gt; to Norway on 30 November 2010, and start a new life there for himself and his ambitions. He cannot enter his beloved Bangladesh ever again without being &lt;a href=\"Prosecutor\"&gt;prosecuted&lt;/a&gt;.\nCartooning in Norway.\nIn Norway, his cartoons were published in various newspapers and magazines, such as &lt;a href=\"Akershus%20Amtstidende\"&gt;Akershus Amtstidende&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ny%20Tid\"&gt;Ny Tid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syn%20og%20Segn\"&gt;Syn og Segn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samtiden\"&gt;Samtiden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aftenposten\"&gt;Aftenposten&lt;/a&gt;, \u00d8stlandposten, &lt;a href=\"%C3%98stlands-Posten\"&gt;\u00d8stlands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bladet%20Vester%C3%A5len\"&gt;Bladet Vester\u00e5len&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avisa%20Nordland\"&gt;Avisa Nordland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%A5mdalen%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Gl\u00e5mdalen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stavanger%20Aftenblad\"&gt;Stavanger Aftenblad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20paper\"&gt;Melding til Stortinget&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Norway%29\"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (Norway).\nAttack on cartoon exhibition.\nOn March 1, 2017, Arifur Rahman had an exhibition in Dr\u00f8bak, where some new &lt;a href=\"Syrians\"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s appeared in the exhibition place before opening and took two of his drawings. One of the drawings was from &lt;a href=\"2007%20Bangladesh%20cartoon%20controversy\"&gt;2007 from Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and another one was a criticism of the education system, \u201c&lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Madrasah%20Education%20Board\"&gt;Madrasa Education System&lt;/a&gt;\u201d in Bangladesh.\nOnline media and publishing platform.\nArifur Rahman founded &lt;a href=\"Toons%20Mag\"&gt;Toons Mag&lt;/a&gt; on November 1, 2009. With it, Arifur Rahman's ambition was to create a platform for artists around the world to express themselves without ever being concerned about being shut up by others. Toons Mag was everything Arif had dreamed of and more. To this day, Toons Mag promotes &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20speech\"&gt;freedom of expression&lt;/a&gt; and encourages cartoonists around the world to contribute to it to enrich their cartooning expertise. It has also been holding the International Cartoon Contest and Exhibition every year since 2015 and its venues are scattered around Europe and Asia. Hundreds of cartoonists from around the globe participate in the contest and the selected artworks are exhibited in selected venues each year. So far, it has held exhibitions in over forty venues around the world. Toons Mag is exclusively edited by Arifur Rahman and it continues to be an untameable advocate of free speech. Cartoonists and writers from around the world willingly contribute to Toons Mag to showcase their talent and fulfill their potential.\nIn 2015, Toons Mag was nominated for the Best of Online Activism by &lt;a href=\"The%20BOBs%20%28weblog%20award%29\"&gt;The BOBs&lt;/a&gt; (Best of the Blogs), sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Welle\"&gt;Deutsche Welle&lt;/a&gt; and won it with an outstanding number of votes to its credit. Toons Mag also awards The Cartoonist of the Year Medal every year for outstanding contributions to cartoons since 2016. Arifur Rahman is the one behind Toons Mag's excellence and it has become a mirror of who its founder is at heart.\nExhibitions.\nSince 2000 to present, his artwork and cartoons have been exhibited in more than 40 places, including Bangladesh, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; and the United States.\nInternational initiatives.\nArifur Rahman organized multiple International Cartoon Contest and Exhibitions through the cartoon Magazine &lt;a href=\"Toons%20Mag\"&gt;Toons Mag&lt;/a&gt; to support &lt;a href=\"children%27s%20rights\"&gt;children's rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rights\"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt;, freedom of expression, and &lt;a href=\"gender%20equality\"&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren in War.\nIn 2015, organized the International Cartoon Exhibition \"\" to focus on the suffering of children in war and conflict areas, such as in &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.
