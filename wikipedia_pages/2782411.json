    "text": "Kenneth Louis Korach (born January 30, 1952) is an American &lt;a href=\"sports%20commentator\"&gt;sports commentator&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt; and published author.\nEarly life and education.\nKorach was born in Los Angeles in 1952. He went on to attend &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20State%20University\"&gt;San Diego State University&lt;/a&gt; for college, where he worked on the school's newspaper, before he transferred to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara\"&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1975 with a B.A. in Social Sciences.\nBroadcasting career.\nKorach started his broadcasting career in 1980 for &lt;a href=\"KZNB\"&gt;KTOB&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Petaluma%2C%20California\"&gt;Petaluma, California&lt;/a&gt;, where he was involved with high school sports. In 1981, he joined &lt;a href=\"California%20League\"&gt;California League&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Pioneers\"&gt;Redwood Pioneers&lt;/a&gt; and broadcast on &lt;a href=\"KSRO\"&gt;KSRO&lt;/a&gt; on a part-time basis, eventually becoming full-time with them in 1984. While with the Pioneers, he joined &lt;a href=\"Sonoma%20State%20University\"&gt;Sonoma State University&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 where he broadcast &lt;a href=\"Sonoma%20State%20Seawolves\"&gt;Seawolves&lt;/a&gt;' football and basketball games.\nKorach joined &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20State%20University\"&gt;San Jose State University&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, and broadcast for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20State%20Spartans\"&gt;San Jose State Spartans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20State%20Spartans%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; teams. For a brief period, Korach also served on the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Firebirds\"&gt;Phoenix Firebirds&lt;/a&gt; broadcast crew from 1986 to 1987. From 1989 to 1991, he was with another PCL team, the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Stars%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Las Vegas Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1992, Korach made a number of professional leaps. He joined the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Las%20Vegas\"&gt;University of Nevada, Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; to broadcast &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Rebels%20football\"&gt;UNLV Rebels football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Runnin%27%20Rebels%20basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; games. He remained with the football team through 1995 and continued with the basketball team until 2004. 1992 also saw Korach make his debut in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, when he joined the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; broadcasting team. He worked mainly weekend games for the White Sox when &lt;a href=\"John%20Rooney%20%28sportscaster%29\"&gt;John Rooney&lt;/a&gt; traveled to call the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20CBS%20Radio\"&gt;CBS Radio \"Game of the Week\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nKorach joined the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, replacing long-time sportscaster &lt;a href=\"Lon%20Simmons\"&gt;Lon Simmons&lt;/a&gt;. Working alongside &lt;a href=\"Bill%20King\"&gt;Bill King&lt;/a&gt;, whom Korach regarded as a childhood hero, and former MLB catcher and color commentator &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Fosse\"&gt;Ray Fosse&lt;/a&gt;, the Oakland Athletics radio team was ranked as the second-best crew in the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; by \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\". Korach was promoted to lead announcer for the Athletics after the 2005 season to replace King, who died in October 2005.\nKorach is the author of \"Holy Toledo \u2013 Lessons from Bill King: Renaissance Man of the Mic\" (), a biography of his former broadcasting partner Bill King. It was released in September 2013 by Wellstone Books, and features contributions from longtime San Francisco Giants lead broadcaster &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Miller\"&gt;Jon Miller&lt;/a&gt;. \nKorach co-authored his second book with Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle, If These Walls Could Talk, Oakland A\u2019s, published by Triumph Books in March of 2019.\nPerfect game call.\nOn May 9, 2010, Korach was the commentator for the conclusion of A's pitcher &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Braden\"&gt;Dallas Braden&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Braden%27s%20perfect%20game\"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt;. Korach told \"&lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Review-Journal\"&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" columnist Ron Kantowski that although everyone in the ballpark was aware of what was going on, the words \"perfect game\" weren't used in the broadcast until the eighth inning. At the game's conclusion, Korach said, \"A PERFECT GAME! Dallas Braden has thrown a perfect game! The A's have beaten Tampa Bay, four to nothing! The kid from Stockton has done it for the A's!\"\nA's Winning for the Community.\nKorach is the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Athletics\"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt;' \"A's Winning for the Community\" program. He had previously heard of trouble at &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Technical%20High%20School\"&gt;Oakland Technical High School&lt;/a&gt;, the alma mater of former A's outfielder and &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Rickey%20Henderson\"&gt;Rickey Henderson&lt;/a&gt;. He personally donated $5,000 to the Field of Dreams project, which ultimately succeeded, and Korach gave the dedication speech on April 4, 2008.\nFeeling he could do more for the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%2C%20California\"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt; community, Korach met with Athletics executives and created the \"A's Winning for the Community\" program. Korach and the Athletics donate money to members of the Oakland Athletic League's baseball programs, which involve schools from the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Unified%20School%20District\"&gt;Oakland Unified School District&lt;/a&gt;, after each Athletics victory.\nHonors and awards.\nKorach has been honored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Sportscasters%20and%20Sportswriters%20Association\"&gt;National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association&lt;/a&gt; twice in his career. He was named the 2001 Nevada Sportscaster of the Year when he was based in Las Vegas for his work with the &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Runnin%27%20Rebels%20basketball\"&gt;UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball&lt;/a&gt; season. In 2013, he was named the California Sportscaster of the Year for his work with the Oakland Athletics radio network and &lt;a href=\"KGMZ-FM\"&gt;95.7 The Game&lt;/a&gt;, beating out &lt;a href=\"John%20Ireland%20%28sportscaster%29\"&gt;John Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2003, Korach was elected by the &lt;a href=\"Nevada%20Broadcasters%20Association\"&gt;Nevada Broadcasters Association&lt;/a&gt; to the Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\nIn 2017, Korach was inducted into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California and in 2019, the iconic Bay Area voice was inducted into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame. \nPersonal life.\nIn March 2012, it was reported that Korach underwent left knee replacement surgery. As a result, he missed several weeks on the broadcast. After the 2014 season, Korach suffered another injury to his left knee and had been rehabbing it, but was forced to miss the start of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;2015 Oakland Athletics season&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to the booth on May 23, 2015 after missing the first 46 games to the season.\nKorach is married to Denise Korach (n\u00e9e Moran), and has a daughter, Emilee. He resides in &lt;a href=\"Henderson%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Henderson, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;."
