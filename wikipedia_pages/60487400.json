    "text": "Flagstaff Lake is one of a group of interconnected, &lt;a href=\"alkali\"&gt;alkali&lt;/a&gt;ne, high-desert lakes known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Warner%20Lakes\"&gt;Warner Lakes&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Valley\"&gt;Warner Valley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Lake County&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. Flagstaff Lake lies between Upper Campbell Lake to the north and Swamp Lake to the south, about northeast of &lt;a href=\"Lakeview%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Lakeview&lt;/a&gt;. It has a surface area of about and a shoreline of about .\nThe Warner Lakes vary in depth and volume depending on the weather and have completely dried up at times. Fish populations also vary. During a drought from 1988 to 1992, when all of the lakes went dry, some fish survived by retreating into a &lt;a href=\"slough%20%28hydrology%29\"&gt;slough&lt;/a&gt; connected to the lakes. Historically, fish species in the lakes have included &lt;a href=\"crappie\"&gt;crappie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brown%20bullhead\"&gt;brown bullhead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"largemouth%20bass\"&gt;largemouth bass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"redband%20trout\"&gt;redband trout&lt;/a&gt;."
