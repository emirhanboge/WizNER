Growing up, he revealed that he initially hated football, but thanks to his stubborn father, he grew to like football as a sport.\nClub career.\nGenk.\nPocognoli began his career with the youth team of &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Standard Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;, but he left at the age of 15 to join &lt;a href=\"K.R.C.%20Genk\"&gt;Genk&lt;/a&gt;, where the club offered him a professional contract and felt Standard Liege would not gave him a first team opportunities if he had stayed.\nPocognoli made his Genk debut, where he came on as a substitute for &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Ingrao\"&gt;Marco Ingrao&lt;/a&gt; in the second half, in a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"K.A.A.%20Gent\"&gt;Gent&lt;/a&gt; on 9 April 2004, which turns out to be his own appearance this season. However, newly\u2013Manager &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Vandereycken\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Vandereycken&lt;/a&gt; sent him to the reserve team the following season. In 2006 he made a first team breakthrough at the club and played his first game for the past two years on 22 January 2006, where he made his first start and played 69 minutes before being substituted in a 2\u20131 loss against &lt;a href=\"R.%20Charleroi%20S.C.\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;. In the next game against &lt;a href=\"K.V.C.%20Westerlo\"&gt;Westerlo&lt;/a&gt; on 28 January 2006, Pocognoli scored his first Genk goal (and his first professional goal), in a 2\u20130 win. He finished the 2005\u201306 season with fifteen appearances and one goal.\nDespite interest from clubs like &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;, Pocognoli ended up staying at the club and did well when he set up a goal for &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bo%C5%A1njak\"&gt;Ivan Bo\u0161njak&lt;/a&gt;, in a 1\u20131 draw against Standard Li\u00e8ge on 19 August 2006. Three days later, Pocognoli signed a new contract with Genk, keeping him until 2008 and two months later, he signed another contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2011 Despite being sent\u2013off for a second bookable offence against &lt;a href=\"Sint-Truidense%20V.V.\"&gt;Sint-Truidense&lt;/a&gt; on 29 October 2006, Pocognoli became a regular for the club during the 2006\u201307 season, making thirty\u2013four appearances in all competition. At the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Pocognoli was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20professional%20football%20awards%23Young%20Professional%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Young Player Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award, but lost out to &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Biglia\"&gt;Lucas Biglia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAZ.\nOn 20 June 2007, Pocognoli left Genk to join &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"AZ%20Alkmaar\"&gt;AZ Alkmaar&lt;/a&gt;, signing a five\u2013year contract with them. The fee was worth about \u20ac2.75 million. Upon joining the club, Pocognoli revealed that he had an offer to join &lt;a href=\"Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;, but opted for AZ instead.\nPocognoli made his AZ Alkmaar debut, where he came on as a substitute in the second half, in a 4\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"VVV-Venlo\"&gt;VVV-Venlo&lt;/a&gt; in the opening game of the season. Pocognoli then scored his first goal for the club, in the UEFA Cup match, in a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Pa%C3%A7os%20de%20Ferreira\"&gt;Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira&lt;/a&gt; on 20 September 2007. Pocognoli scored his first league goal for the club on 9 December 2007, in a 2\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"FC%20Utrecht\"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt; and his second later came on 22 January 2008, in a 2\u20131 loss against &lt;a href=\"NAC%20Breda\"&gt;NAC Breda&lt;/a&gt;.

His second goal for the club later came on 21 January 2009, in a 3\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Achilles%20%2729\"&gt;Achilles '29&lt;/a&gt; and three days later on 24 January 2009, he scored again in a 2\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"De%20Graafschap\"&gt;De Graafschap&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite this, he helped the club win the league for the first time since 1981 after title contender &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; lost 6\u20132 to &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; on 18 April 2009. Pocognoli went on to make twenty\u2013seven appearances and scoring three times in all competition in the 2008\u201309 season.\nAhead of the 2009\u201310 season, Pocognoli surprisingly attracted interest from &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. He ended the transfer speculation when he signed a contract with the club on 14 June 2009, keeping him until 2014. Pocognoli helped the club win the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Johan%20Cruyff%20Shield\"&gt;Johan Cruyff Shield&lt;/a&gt;, where he set up one of the goals, in a 5\u20131 win over Heereveen. However, his first team opportunities was limited under the new management of &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Koeman\"&gt;Ronald Koeman&lt;/a&gt;, due to injury and spent most of the first half of the season on the substitute bench.

However, as the 2014\u201315 season progressed, Pocognoli lost his first team place following the arrival of new manager &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Pulis\"&gt;Tony Pulis&lt;/a&gt;, who preferred &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Brunt\"&gt;Chris Brunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Baird\"&gt;Chris Baird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joleon%20Lescott\"&gt;Joleon Lescott&lt;/a&gt; in the left back role, as well as being hampered by injury concerns. Pocognoli ended his first season at West Brom with 16 appearances to his name.\nAhead of the 2015\u201316 season, Pocognoli considered leaving the club, citing a lack of first team opportunities. Though Pulis openly admitted Pocognoli could leave if the club's valuation was met, Pocognoli stayed at the club throughout pre-season and made his first appearance of the season in a 3\u20130 loss against &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt; in the second round of League Cup.

Following this, Pocognoli said he was still determined to fight for a first team place, having only made 4 appearances in the 2015\u201316 season. Pocognoli finally made his first league appearance of the season, and set up &lt;a href=\"Salom%C3%B3n%20Rond%C3%B3n\"&gt;Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; to score the only goal, in a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; on 6 March 2016.
