    "text": "The Essex and Suffolk Border Football League is a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition based in England. The league has a total of four divisions headed by the Premier Division which sits at step 7 (or level 11) of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20System\"&gt;National League System&lt;/a&gt;. The top club may apply for promotion to Division One of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;Eastern Counties League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll member clubs compete in the Border League Knock-Out Cup. The league is affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%20FA\"&gt;Essex County FA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20County%20FA\"&gt;Suffolk County FA&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe league was officially founded in 1911, although the league includes records of the Colchester Borough League (founded 1893) and Colchester &amp; District League (founded 1903) in its history. Founder members of the Border League in the inaugural 1911\u201312 season included &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Clacton\"&gt;Clacton Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Colchester Town&lt;/a&gt;, West Bergholt and West Mersea. \nOver the last 100 years the league has seen many changes in its status with many clubs progressing to a higher level. The overlying trend has been the migration of the larger clubs and their replacement by smaller clubs with more basic facilities. For much of the last 20 years the Border League has run 4 divisions which included a significant proportion of reserve teams. The league lost several members in 2005\u201306 when the reserve teams of the Eastern Counties League clubs left for their own competition. There is a high representation of village teams but a new trend has emerged with the acceptance of Barnston from Division Three of the &lt;a href=\"Essex%20Olympian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Essex Olympian League&lt;/a&gt; and Newbury Forest from the Romford and District Football League in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Redbridge\"&gt;London Borough of Redbridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nMember clubs 2021\u201322.\nThe league has 87 teams spread over six divisions for the 2021\u201322 season:\nFormer clubs.\nAmong the clubs that have left the Essex &amp; Suffolk Border Football League to compete at a higher level are:"
