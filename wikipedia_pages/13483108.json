    "text": "Ensaculin (KA-672) is a drug from the &lt;a href=\"coumarin\"&gt;coumarin&lt;/a&gt; family, which has been researched as a potential treatment for &lt;a href=\"dementia\"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. It acts on a number of receptor systems, being both a weak &lt;a href=\"NMDA%20antagonist\"&gt;NMDA antagonist&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"5HT1A%20receptor\"&gt;5HT1A&lt;/a&gt; agonist. Animal studies have shown promising &lt;a href=\"nootropic\"&gt;nootropic&lt;/a&gt; effects, although efficacy in humans has yet to be proven. It was well tolerated in human trials, with the main side effect being orthostatic &lt;a href=\"hypotension\"&gt;hypotension&lt;/a&gt; (low blood pressure)."
