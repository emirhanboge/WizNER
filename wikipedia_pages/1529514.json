    "text": "Academic writing or scholarly writing is &lt;a href=\"nonfiction\"&gt;non fiction&lt;/a&gt; produced as part of academic work, including reports on empirical &lt;a href=\"Field%20research\"&gt;fieldwork&lt;/a&gt; or research in facilities for the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20science\"&gt;natural sciences&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Social%20science\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;, monographs in which scholars analyze culture, propose new theories, or develop interpretations from &lt;a href=\"Archive\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;, as well as undergraduate versions of all of these. \nThough the tone, style, content, and organization of academic writing vary across genres and across publication methods, nearly all academic writing shares a relatively formal prose &lt;a href=\"Register%20%28sociolinguistics%29\"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citation\"&gt;frequent reference&lt;/a&gt; to other academic work, and the use of fairly stable rhetorical moves to define the scope of the project, situate it in the relevant research, and to advance a new contribution. \nAcademic style.\nAcademic writing often features a prose &lt;a href=\"Register%20%28sociolinguistics%29\"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; that is conventionally characterized by \"evidence...that the writer(s) have been persistent, open-minded, and disciplined in study\"; that prioritizes \"reason over emotion or sensual perception\"; and that imagines a reader who is \"coolly rational, reading for information, and intending to formulate a reasoned response.\" The particular stylistic means of achieving these conventions can differ considerably by academic discipline. These differences help explain the distinctive sounds of, for example, writing in history versus engineering or physics versus philosophy. One attempt to account for these differences in writing is known as the theory of \"discourse communities\".\nBiber and Gray suggested that there are significant differences with regards to complexity in academic writing in &lt;a href=\"humanities\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, with humanities writing often focused on structural elaboration, and sciences, on structural compression.\nCriticism.\nAcademic style, particularly in humanities, has been often criticized for being too full of jargon and hard to understand by the general public.\nDiscourse community.\nA &lt;a href=\"discourse%20community\"&gt;discourse community&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a group of people that shares mutual interests and beliefs. \"It establishes limits and regularities...who may speak, what may be spoken, and how it is to be said; in addition [rules] prescribe what is true and false, what is reasonable and what foolish, and what is meant and what not.\"\nThe concept of a discourse community is vital to academic writers across nearly all disciplines, for the academic writer's purpose is to influence how their community understands its field of study: whether by maintaining, adding to, revising, or contesting what that community regards as \"known\" or \"true.\" Academic writers have strong incentives to follow conventions established by their community in order for their attempts to influence this community to be legible.\nDiscourse community constraints.\nConstraints are the discourse community's written and unwritten conventions about what a writer can say and how he or she can say it. They define what is an acceptable argument. Each discourse community expects to see a writer construct his or her argument using their conventional style of language and vocabulary, and they expect a writer to use the established &lt;a href=\"intertext\"&gt;intertext&lt;/a&gt; within the discourse community as the building blocks for his or her argument.\nWriting for a discourse community.\nIn order for a writer to become familiar with some of the constraints of the discourse community they are writing for. Across most discourses communities, writers will:\nEach of theses above are constructed differently depending on the discourse community the writer is in. For example, the way a claim is made in a high school paper would look very different from the way a claim is made in a college composition class. It is important for the academic writer to familiarize himself or herself with the conventions of the discourse community by reading and analyzing other works, so that the writer is best able to communicate his or her ideas.\nNovel argument.\nWithin discourse communities, academic writers build on top of the ideas established by previous writers. \nGood academic writers know the importance of researching previous work from within the discourse community and using this work to build their own claims. By taking these ideas and expanding upon them or applying them in a new way, a writer is able to make their novel argument.\nIntertextuality.\n&lt;a href=\"Intertextuality\"&gt;Intertextuality&lt;/a&gt; is the combining of past writings into original, new pieces of text. Usually attributed to &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Kristeva\"&gt;Julia Kristeva&lt;/a&gt;, the concept of intertextuality is helpful for understanding that all texts are necessarily related to prior texts through a network of explicit or implicit links, allusions, repetitions, acknowledged or unacknowledged inspiration, and direct quotations. Writers (often unwittingly) make use of what has previously been written and thus some degree of borrowing is inevitable. One of the most &lt;a href=\"Salience%20%28language%29\"&gt;salient&lt;/a&gt; features of academic writing irrespective of discipline is its unusually explicit conventions for marking intertextuality through &lt;a href=\"citation\"&gt;citation&lt;/a&gt; and bibliography. Conventions for these markings (e.g., MLA, APA, IEEE, Chicago, etc.) vary by discourse community.\nSummarizing and integrating other texts in academic writing is often metaphorically described as \"entering the conversation,\" as described by Kenneth Burke:\nKey elements.\nThere are a number of areas of importance in all academic and scholarly writing. While some areas, such as the use of appropriate references and the avoidance of plagiarism, are not open to challenge, other elements, such as the appropriate style, are contested.\nAcademic genres.\nPersonal forms.\n\"These are acceptable to some academic disciplines, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20studies\"&gt;Cultural studies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fine%20art\"&gt;Fine art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feminist%20studies\"&gt;Feminist studies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queer\"&gt;Queer theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Literary%20studies\"&gt;Literary studies&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFormat.\nA commonly recognized format for presenting original research in the social and applied sciences is known as &lt;a href=\"IMRAD\"&gt;IMRD&lt;/a&gt;, an initialism that refers to the usual ordering of subsections:\nand\nStandalone methods sections are atypical in presenting research in the humanities; other common formats in the applied and social sciences are IMRAD (which offers an \"Analysis\" section separate from the implications presented in the \"Discussion\" section) and IRDM (found in some engineering subdisciplines, which features Methods at the end of the document). \nOther common sections in academic documents are:"
