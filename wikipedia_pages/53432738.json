He played mostly for amateur teams such as &lt;a href=\"Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;MCC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incogniti\"&gt;Incogniti&lt;/a&gt; and Blue Mantles, but made his first-class debut for &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kent County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1874, playing against &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;. Parke's other first-class appearances came between 1879 and 1884, six for MCC and one for the South.\nParke was described in his \"&lt;a href=\"Wisden\"&gt;Wisden&lt;/a&gt;\" obituary as being a \"good batsman\" and a \"fast, round-arm bowler\". He scored 110 runs and took one wicket in his eight first-class appearances. He died at his house at Cromwell Park, &lt;a href=\"South%20Kensington\"&gt;South Kensington&lt;/a&gt; in London in 1923 aged 72."
