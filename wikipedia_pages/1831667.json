    "text": "The National Hockey Stadium was a sports stadium in &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Keynes\"&gt;Milton Keynes&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom, with a nominal capacity of around 4,000 seats: this was temporarily increased to 9,000 between 2003 and 2007. The stadium no longer exists, having been demolished and replaced by a new headquarters building for &lt;a href=\"Network%20Rail\"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stadium was used by &lt;a href=\"England%20Hockey\"&gt;England Hockey&lt;/a&gt; as their national stadium from 1995 to 2003 and then as a professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20Football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; stadium, first for &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20F.C.\"&gt;Wimbledon F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, then its successor club &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.\"&gt;Milton Keynes Dons F.C.&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn summer 2007, the Dons relocated to the \"&lt;a href=\"Stadium%20mk\"&gt;Stadium mk&lt;/a&gt;\", their new stadium near &lt;a href=\"Bletchley\"&gt;Bletchley&lt;/a&gt; leaving the hockey stadium without a tenant. From then until late 2009 (when demolition began in preparation for the site to be redeveloped), the ground remained unused. In July 2012, on the site became operational.\nHockey.\nThe stadium was built in 1995 as a new national &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt; stadium, with a &lt;a href=\"synthetic%20turf\"&gt;synthetic pitch&lt;/a&gt;. The ground was used for national and international (field) hockey until 2003. It had a covered main stand running the full length of one side of the pitch, opposite which was an unroofed stand running about one third of the length of the pitch, straddling the halfway line.\nIn 1997, the stadium was used as the venue for the sixth edition of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Hockey%20Federation\"&gt;FIH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hockey%20Junior%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Men's Junior World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the venue, in 2000, for the FIH Women's Qualifying Tournament for the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%202000%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Sydney 2000 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2003, when the ground was leased to &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20F.C.\"&gt;Wimbledon F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a grass pitch was laid, meaning that the stadium was out of commission for hockey. Temporary stands were added at either end of the pitch. Hockey internationals and playoff matches were reallocated to various leading club grounds around the country. In May 2007, at the end of the lease, the temporary stands were removed.\nOn 2 April 2007 the trustees of the National Hockey Foundation, which owned the lease of the stadium, announced that they had arranged to hand the lease back to &lt;a href=\"English%20Partnerships\"&gt;English Partnerships&lt;/a&gt; since a detailed study had shown that the stadium would no longer be viable as a hockey venue particularly in light of the building of &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Hockey%20Centre%20%28London%29\"&gt;another hockey facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratford%2C%20London\"&gt;Stratford, London&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the 2012 Olympics facilities.\nFootball.\nThe stadium was the home of &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20F.C.\"&gt;Wimbledon Football Club&lt;/a&gt; from September 2003 until June 2004 and, after the club's rebranding, of &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.\"&gt;Milton Keynes Dons&lt;/a&gt; until May 2007. The club moved in during 2003, converted the synthetic pitch to grass and added additional stands and seating (with up to 9,000 seats). In July 2007 the club moved to its new \"Stadium mk\" at &lt;a href=\"Denbigh%2C%20Milton%20Keynes%23Denbigh%20North\"&gt;Denbigh North&lt;/a&gt;, near Bletchley, prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"2007-08%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season. \nRecord attendance at the National Hockey Stadium:\n8,306 v &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;\nLeague Cup 3rd Round, 25 October 2006.\nAverage Attendance\nAt the National Hockey Stadium:\n2006\u20132007: 6,034 (League Two)\n2005\u20132006: 5,776 (League One)\n2004\u20132005: 4,896 (League One)\nDemolition.\nAfter the Dons left for Denbigh, the supplementary seating was disassembled, returning the capacity to 4,000. However, the venue was not used notably thereafter.\nAt end of October 2008, &lt;a href=\"English%20Partnerships\"&gt;English Partnerships&lt;/a&gt; (owners of the site) announced agreement with &lt;a href=\"Network%20Rail\"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; to make the site available for a new headquarters building, which meant that the stadium would be demolished.\nOn 17 December 2009, demolition of the stadium began and the site was cleared by March 2010. opened in June 2012."
