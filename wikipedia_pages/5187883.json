As of 2015, maritime law enforcement in Indonesia is conducted by 12 different agencies from different ministries of the government. The &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; is also authorized to conduct maritime law enforcement in certain cases as it is stated in the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; of the country.\nThere has been plans to amalgamate these different maritime law enforcement agencies to become a singular national \"Indonesian Coast Guard\" such as the &lt;a href=\"US%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard of India&lt;/a&gt; since 2011. In February 2020, President &lt;a href=\"Joko%20Widodo\"&gt;Joko Widodo&lt;/a&gt; announced that he intended to have &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Maritime%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;Maritime Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; as Indonesian &lt;a href=\"coast%20guard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt;. However, as of 2021, new maritime security law to fix overlapping authority in maritime law enforcement is still being drafted.\nOther law enforcement agencies.\nOther types of government agencies which is involved in law enforcement of the state:"
