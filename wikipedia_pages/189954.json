    "text": "Konya (), historically known as Iconium (), is a major city in south-central &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, on the south-western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Anatolia%20Region\"&gt;Central Anatolian Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs of the last 31/12/2019 estimation, the Metropolitan Province population was 2,232,274 inhabitants whom 1,346,330 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 3 urban districts making it the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;seventh-most-populous&lt;/a&gt; city in Turkey. Konya is a large and industrially developed city and the capital of &lt;a href=\"Konya%20Province\"&gt;Konya Province&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Konya region has been inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC and was ruled by various civilizations such as &lt;a href=\"Hittites\"&gt;Hittite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phrygia\"&gt;Phrygia&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20period\"&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; ones. Konya was known as \"Iconium\" during &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical antiquity&lt;/a&gt;. In the 11th century the &lt;a href=\"Seljuq%20dynasty\"&gt;Seljuk Turks&lt;/a&gt; conquered the area and began ruling over its &lt;a href=\"R%C3%BBm\"&gt;R\u00fbm&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Byzantine\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt;) inhabitants making Konya the capital of their new &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Rum\"&gt;Sultanate of Rum&lt;/a&gt;. Under the Seljuks, the city reached the height of its wealth and influence. Following the demise of Rum, Konya came under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Karamanids\"&gt;Karamanids&lt;/a&gt;, before being taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the 15th century. After the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Turkish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; the city became part of the modern Republic of Turkey.\nName.\nKonya was known in &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical antiquity&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval period&lt;/a&gt; as (\"Ik\u00f3nion\") in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20traditional%20Greek%20place%20names\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; (with regular &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20Greek\"&gt;Medieval Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Apheresis%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;apheresis&lt;/a&gt; \"K\u00f3nio(n)\") and as in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ik\u00f3nion\" is the Hellenization of an older &lt;a href=\"Luwian%20language\"&gt;Luwian&lt;/a&gt; name \"Ikkuwaniya\".\nBy some the name \"Ik\u00f3nion\" is commonly explained as a derivation from (\"&lt;a href=\"icon\"&gt;icon&lt;/a&gt;\"), as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;legend&lt;/a&gt; ascribed its name to the \"\"eikon\" (image), or the \"&lt;a href=\"gorgon\"&gt;gorgon&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Medusa\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt;'s) head\"\", with which &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt; vanquished the native population before founding the city.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Suda\"&gt;Suda&lt;/a&gt;, Perseus after he married &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; founded the city and called it Amandra (\u1f0c\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd) and the city had a &lt;a href=\"stele\"&gt;stele&lt;/a&gt; depicting the Gorgon. The city later changed the name to Ikonion because it had the depiction (\u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1) of the Gorgon.\nIn some historic English texts, the city's name appears as \"Konia\" or \"Koniah\".\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nExcavations have shown that the region was inhabited during the Late &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Age\"&gt;Copper Age&lt;/a&gt;, around 3000 BC. The city came under the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Hittites\"&gt;Hittites&lt;/a&gt; around 1500 BC. Later it was overtaken by the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Peoples\"&gt;Sea Peoples&lt;/a&gt; in around 1200 BC.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Phrygia\"&gt;Phrygia&lt;/a&gt;ns established their kingdom in central &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; in the 8th century BC. &lt;a href=\"Xenophon\"&gt;Xenophon&lt;/a&gt; describes Iconium, as the city was called, as the last city of Phrygia. The region was overwhelmed by &lt;a href=\"Cimmerians\"&gt;Cimmerian&lt;/a&gt; invaders c. 690 BC. It was later part of the &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Persian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, until &lt;a href=\"Darius%20III\"&gt;Darius III&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt; in 333 BC. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death and the town came under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Seleucus%20I%20Nicator\"&gt;Seleucus I Nicator&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20period\"&gt;Hellenistic period&lt;/a&gt; the town was ruled by the kings of &lt;a href=\"Pergamon\"&gt;Pergamon&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Attalus%20III\"&gt;Attalus III&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir, he bequeathed his kingdom to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Once incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, under the rule of emperor &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt;, the city's name was changed to Claudioconium, and during the rule of emperor &lt;a href=\"Hadrian\"&gt;Hadrian&lt;/a&gt;us to Colonia Aelia Hadriana.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles\"&gt;Acts of the Apostles&lt;/a&gt;, the apostles &lt;a href=\"Paul%20of%20Tarsus\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barnabas\"&gt;Barnabas&lt;/a&gt; preached in Iconium during their first &lt;a href=\"Missionary%20journeys%20of%20Paul\"&gt;Missionary Journey&lt;/a&gt; in about 47\u201348 AD, having been persecuted in &lt;a href=\"Antioch%20of%20Pisidia\"&gt;Antioch&lt;/a&gt;. Their visit to the &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; of the Jews in Iconium divided the Jewish and &lt;a href=\"Gentile\"&gt;non-Jewish&lt;/a&gt; communities between those who believed Paul and Barnabas' message and those who did not believe, provoking a disturbance during which attempts were made to &lt;a href=\"stoning\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; the apostles. They fled to &lt;a href=\"Lystra\"&gt;Lystra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derbe\"&gt;Derbe&lt;/a&gt;, cities of &lt;a href=\"Lycaonia\"&gt;Lycaonia&lt;/a&gt;. (This experience is also mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Letter%20to%20Timothy\"&gt;Second Letter to Timothy&lt;/a&gt;. 19th century American theologian &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Barnes%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;Albert Barnes&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Timothy had been present with Paul in Iconium, Antioch and Lystra). Paul and &lt;a href=\"Silas\"&gt;Silas&lt;/a&gt; probably visited it again during Paul's Second Missionary Journey in about 50, as well as near the beginning of his Third Missionary Journey several years later. The city became the seat of a bishop, which in ca. 370 was raised to the status of a &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20of%20Iconium\"&gt;metropolitan see&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Lycaonia\"&gt;Lycaonia&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Amphilochius\"&gt;Saint Amphilochius&lt;/a&gt; as the first metropolitan bishop.\nIn Christian legend, based on the &lt;a href=\"apocryphal\"&gt;apocryphal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Paul%20and%20Thecla\"&gt;Acts of Paul and Thecla&lt;/a&gt;, Iconium was also the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Thecla\"&gt;Saint Thecla&lt;/a&gt;, who saved the city from attack by the &lt;a href=\"Isaurians\"&gt;Isaurians&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the city was part of the &lt;a href=\"Anatolic%20Theme\"&gt;Anatolic Theme&lt;/a&gt;. During the 8th to 10th centuries, the town and the nearby (Caballa) &lt;a href=\"Kaballah%20Fortress\"&gt;Kaballah Fortress&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Gevale Kalesi\") (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.google.com/maps/place/37%25C2%25B054%2706.4%2522N%2B32%25C2%25B023%2713.3%2522E/%4037.9017802%2C32.3848373%2C843m/data%3D%213m2%211e3%214b1%214m6%213m5%211s0x0%3A0x0%217e2%218m2%213d37.9017757%214d32.3870263\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;) were a frequent target of &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; attacks as part of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars\"&gt;Arab\u2013Byzantine wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeljuk and Karamanid eras.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Seljuk%20Turks\"&gt;Seljuk Turks&lt;/a&gt; first raided the area &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Iconium%20%281069%29\"&gt;in 1069&lt;/a&gt;, but a period of chaos overwhelmed Anatolia after the Seljuk victory in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Manzikert\"&gt;Battle of Manzikert&lt;/a&gt; in 1071, and the &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; mercenary leader &lt;a href=\"Roussel%20de%20Bailleul\"&gt;Roussel de Bailleul&lt;/a&gt; rose in revolt at Iconium. The city was finally conquered by the Seljuks in 1084. From 1097 to 1243 it was the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Seljuq%20dynasty\"&gt;Seljuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Rum\"&gt;Sultanate of Rum&lt;/a&gt;. It was briefly occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%20of%20Bouillon\"&gt;Godfrey of Bouillon&lt;/a&gt; (August 1097), and &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Frederick Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt; (May 18, 1190) after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Iconium%20%281190%29\"&gt;Battle of Iconium (1190)&lt;/a&gt;. The area was reoccupied by the Turks after the crusaders left.\nKonya reached the height of its wealth and influence in the second half of the 12th century when the Seljuk sultans of Rum also subdued the &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20beyliks\"&gt;Anatolian beyliks&lt;/a&gt; to their east, especially that of the &lt;a href=\"Danishmends\"&gt;Danishmends&lt;/a&gt;, thus establishing their rule over virtually all of eastern &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as acquiring several port towns along the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Alanya\"&gt;Alanya&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Sinop%2C%20Turkey\"&gt;Sinop&lt;/a&gt;) and even gaining a momentary foothold in &lt;a href=\"Sudak\"&gt;Sudak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimea\"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt;. This golden age lasted until the first decades of the 13th century.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Persian%20people\"&gt;Persians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Persianized%20Turks\"&gt;Persianized Turks&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Persia\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; migrated to Anatolian cities either to flee the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Khwarezmia%20and%20Eastern%20Iran\"&gt;invading Mongols&lt;/a&gt; or to benefit from the opportunities for educated Muslims in a newly established kingdom.\nFollowing the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20Seljuk%20Sultanate\"&gt;Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; in 1307, Konya became the capital of &lt;a href=\"Karamanids\"&gt;Karamanids&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20beyliks\"&gt;Turkish beylik&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted until 1322 when the city was captured by the neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Karamanids\"&gt;Beylik of Karamano\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;. In 1420, the Beylik of Karamano\u011flu fell to the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1453, Konya was made the provincial capital of &lt;a href=\"Karaman%20Eyalet\"&gt;Karaman Eyalet&lt;/a&gt;.\nOttoman Empire and Turkish Republic eras.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; rule, Konya was administered by the &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eehzade\"&gt;Sultan's sons (\"\u015eehzade\")&lt;/a&gt;, starting with \u015eehzade Mustafa and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Cem\"&gt;\u015eehzade Cem&lt;/a&gt; (the sons of Sultan &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20II\"&gt;Mehmed II&lt;/a&gt;), and later the future Sultan &lt;a href=\"Selim%20II\"&gt;Selim II&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1483 and 1864, Konya was the administrative capital of &lt;a href=\"Karaman%20Eyalet\"&gt;Karaman Eyalet&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Tanzimat\"&gt;Tanzimat&lt;/a&gt; period, as part of the &lt;a href=\"vilayet\"&gt;vilayet&lt;/a&gt; system introduced in 1864, Konya became the seat of the larger &lt;a href=\"Vilayet%20of%20Konya\"&gt;Vilayet of Konya&lt;/a&gt; which replaced Karaman Eyalet.\nKonya had a major &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Air%20Force%23Initial%20stages\"&gt;air base&lt;/a&gt; during the Turkish War of Independence. In 1922, the Air Force was renamed as the Inspectorate of Air Forces and was headquartered in Konya. In 1923 in the frame of the &lt;a href=\"population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey\"&gt;population exchange between Greece and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, the Greeks that inhabited Sille, a nearby village, left as refugees and settled in Greece.\nGovernment.\nThe first local administration in Konya was founded in 1830. This administration was converted into a municipality in 1876. In March 1989, the municipality became a Metropolitan Municipality. As of that date, Konya had three central district municipalities (Meram, Sel\u00e7uklu, Karatay) and a Metropolitan Municipality.\nEconomy.\nThe city ranks among the &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20Tigers\"&gt;Anatolian Tigers&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of &lt;a href=\"industrial%20parks\"&gt;industrial parks&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012 Konya's exports reached 130 countries. A number of Turkish industrial conglomerates, such as Kombassan Holding, have their headquarters in Konya.\nWhile agriculture-based industries play a role, the city's economy has evolved into a center for the manufacturing of components for the automotive industry; machinery manufacturing; agricultural tools; casting industry; plastic paint and chemical industry; construction materials; paper and packing industry; processed foods; textiles; and leather industry.\nGeography.\nKonya is the center of the largest province, the largest plain (&lt;a href=\"Konya%20Plain\"&gt;Konya Plain&lt;/a&gt;) and is among the largest cities in the country.

The largest solar farm of Turkey is located 20 miles west of the city.\nLakes.\n&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Tuz\"&gt;Lake Tuz&lt;/a&gt;, known in Turkish as \"Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc\", is the second-largest lake in all of Turkey. This lake supplies Turkey with a large amount of Turkey's salt demand.\n&lt;a href=\"Beysehir%20Lake\"&gt;Beysehir Lake&lt;/a&gt; is on the western part of Konya and is near the border. It is the largest fresh water lake in Turkey and one of the most important national parks. Beysehir Lake is important for tourism in Konya and attracts thousands of people each year to its 2 beaches and 22 islands for water and mountain sports.\n&lt;a href=\"Meke%20Lake\"&gt;Meke Lake&lt;/a&gt; is on the border of the Karapinar province and is considered to be a heavily protected natural area.\n&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Aksehir\"&gt;Lake Aksehir&lt;/a&gt; is on the border of the Afyon Karahisar province.

In 1273, his followers in Konya established the &lt;a href=\"Mevlevi%20Order\"&gt;Mevlevi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sufi\"&gt;Sufi&lt;/a&gt; order of &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Sufi%20whirling\"&gt;Whirling Dervishes&lt;/a&gt;. Konya has the reputation of being one of the more religiously conservative metropolitan centers in Turkey. It was once known as the \"citadel of Islam\" and its inhabitants are still comparatively more devout than those from other cities.\nEvery Thursday and Saturday, one can see a performance (&lt;a href=\"Sama%20%28Sufism%29\"&gt;Sama&lt;/a&gt;) by the Whirling Dervishes at the Mevlana Museum.
