    "text": "We () is a &lt;a href=\"dystopia\"&gt;dystopia&lt;/a&gt;n novel by Russian writer &lt;a href=\"Yevgeny%20Zamyatin\"&gt;Yevgeny Zamyatin&lt;/a&gt;, written 1920\u20131921. It was first published as an English translation by &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Zilboorg\"&gt;Gregory Zilboorg&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 by &lt;a href=\"E.%20P.%20Dutton\"&gt;E. P. Dutton&lt;/a&gt; in New York, with the original Russian text first published in 1952. The novel describes a world of harmony and conformity within a united &lt;a href=\"totalitarianism\"&gt;totalitarian state&lt;/a&gt;. It influenced the emergence of dystopia as a &lt;a href=\"literary%20genre\"&gt;literary genre&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt; claimed that &lt;a href=\"Aldous%20Huxley\"&gt;Aldous Huxley&lt;/a&gt;'s 1931 \"&lt;a href=\"Brave%20New%20World\"&gt;Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;\" must be partly derived from \"We\", but Huxley denied this.\nSetting.\n\"We\" is set in the future. D-503, a spacecraft engineer, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass, which assists &lt;a href=\"mass%20surveillance\"&gt;mass surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. The structure of the state is &lt;a href=\"Panopticon\"&gt;Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;-like, and life is scientifically managed &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor\"&gt;F. W. Taylor&lt;/a&gt;-like. People march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by their given numbers. The society is run strictly by logic or reason as the primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulae and equations outlined by the One State.\nPlot.\nA few hundred years after the One State's conquest of the entire world, the spaceship \"Integral\" is being built in order to invade and conquer extraterrestrial planets. Meanwhile, the project's chief engineer, D-503, begins a &lt;a href=\"Diary\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship.\nLike all other citizens of One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the &lt;a href=\"secret%20police\"&gt;secret police&lt;/a&gt;, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by her state in life. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.\nWhile on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol, and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are highly illegal according to the laws of One State.\nBoth repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in One State, except for windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians, but finds that he cannot.\nHe begins to have dreams, which disturbs him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom of &lt;a href=\"Mental%20disorder\"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organization plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of One State with the outside world.\nDespite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. However, as her pregnancy progresses, O-90 realizes that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby under any circumstances. At D-503's request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall.\nIn his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the \"Great Operation\", which has recently been mandated for all citizens of One State in order to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical \"reliability\", they would now function as \"tractors in human form\". This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor about the inner workings of the Mephi. However, D-503 expresses surprise that even torture could not induce I-330 to denounce her comrades. Despite her refusal, I-330 and those arrested with her have been sentenced to death, \"under the Benefactor's Machine\".\nMeanwhile, the Mephi uprising gathers strength; parts of the Green Wall have been destroyed, birds are repopulating the city, and people start committing acts of social rebellion. Although D-503 expresses hope that the Benefactor shall restore \"reason\", the novel ends with One State's survival in doubt. I-330's mantra is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be no \"final\" revolution.\nMajor themes.\nDystopian society.\nThe dystopian society depicted in \"We\" is presided over by the Benefactor and is surrounded by a giant Green Wall to separate the citizens from primitive untamed nature. All citizens are known as \"numbers\". Every hour in one's life is directed by \"The Table\".\nThe action of \"We\" is set at some time after the Two Hundred Years' War, which has wiped out all but \"0.2 percent of the earth's population\". The war was over a rare substance only mentioned in the book through a biblical metaphor; the substance was called \"bread\" as the \"Christians gladiated over it\"\u2014as in countries fighting conventional wars. The war only ended after the use of &lt;a href=\"weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction\"&gt;weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt;, so that the One State is surrounded with a post-apocalyptic landscape.\nAllusions and references.\nMany of the names and numbers in \"We\" are allusions to personal experiences of Zamyatin or to culture and literature.\nFor example, \"Auditorium 112\" refers to cell number 112, where Zamyatin was twice imprisoned, and the name of S-4711 is a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Eau%20de%20Cologne\"&gt;Eau de Cologne&lt;/a&gt; number &lt;a href=\"4711%20%28brand%29\"&gt;4711&lt;/a&gt;.\nZamyatin, who worked as a &lt;a href=\"naval%20architect\"&gt;naval architect&lt;/a&gt;, refers to the specifications of the &lt;a href=\"icebreaker\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Lenin%20%281916%20icebreaker%29\"&gt;St. Alexander Nevsky&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe numbers [. . .] of the chief characters in WE are taken directly from the specifications of Zamyatin's favourite icebreaker, the Saint Alexander Nevsky, yard no. A/W 905, round tonnage 3300, where O\u201390 and I-330 appropriately divide the hapless D-503 [. . .] Yu-10 could easily derive from the Swan Hunter yard numbers of no fewer than three of Zamyatin's major icebreakers \u2013 1012, 1020, 1021 [. . .]. R-13 can be found here too, as well as in the yard number of \"&lt;a href=\"Svyatogor%20%28icebreaker%29\"&gt;Sviatogor&lt;/a&gt;\" A/W 904.\nMany comparisons to The Bible exist in \"We\". There are similarities between &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Genesis\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; Chapters 1\u20134 and \"We\", where the One State is considered &lt;a href=\"Paradise\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, D-503 is &lt;a href=\"Adam\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;, and I-330 is &lt;a href=\"Eve\"&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;. The snake in this piece is S-4711, who is described as having a bent and twisted form, with a \"double-curved body\" (he is a double agent). References to Mephistopheles (in the Mephi) are seen as allusions to &lt;a href=\"Satan\"&gt;Satan&lt;/a&gt; and his rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; in the Bible (Ezekiel 28:11\u201319; Isaiah 14:12\u201315). The novel itself could be considered a criticism of organised religion given this interpretation. However, Zamyatin, influenced by &lt;a href=\"Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky\"&gt;Fyodor Dostoyevsky&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Notes%20from%20Underground\"&gt;Notes from Underground&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20Karamazov\"&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/a&gt;\", made the novel a criticism of the excesses of a militantly atheistic society. The novel displayed an indebtedness to &lt;a href=\"H.%20G.%20Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt;'s dystopia \"&lt;a href=\"When%20the%20Sleeper%20Wakes\"&gt;When the Sleeper Wakes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1899).\nThe novel uses mathematical concepts symbolically. The spaceship that D-503 is supervising the construction of is called the \"&lt;a href=\"Integral\"&gt;Integral&lt;/a&gt;\", which he hopes will \"integrate the grandiose cosmic equation\". D-503 also mentions that he is profoundly disturbed by the concept of &lt;a href=\"Imaginary%20unit\"&gt;the square root of \u22121&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which is the basis for imaginary numbers (imagination being deprecated by the One State). Zamyatin's point, probably in light of the increasingly dogmatic Soviet government of the time, would seem to be that it is impossible to remove all the rebels against a system. Zamyatin even says this through I-330: \"There is no final revolution. Revolutions are infinite.\"\nLiterary significance and influences.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Jack%20London\"&gt;Jack London&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Iron%20Heel\"&gt;The Iron Heel&lt;/a&gt;\", \"We\" is generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristic &lt;a href=\"dystopia\"&gt;dystopia&lt;/a&gt; genre. It takes the modern industrial society to an extreme conclusion, depicting a state that believes that &lt;a href=\"free%20will\"&gt;free will&lt;/a&gt; is the cause of unhappiness, and that citizens' lives should be controlled with mathematical precision based on the system of industrial efficiency created by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor\"&gt;Frederick Winslow Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. The Soviet attempt at implementing Taylorism, led by &lt;a href=\"Aleksei%20Gastev\"&gt;Aleksei Gastev&lt;/a&gt;, may have immediately influenced Zamyatin's portrayal of the One State.\nChristopher Collins in \"Evgenij Zamjatin: An Interpretive Study\" finds the many intriguing literary aspects of \"We\" more interesting and relevant today than the political aspects:\nThe little-known Russian dystopian novel \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20in%20the%20Fog%20of%20the%20Future\"&gt;Love in the Fog of the Future&lt;/a&gt;\", published in 1924 by Andrei Marsov, has also been compared to \"We\".\n&lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt; claimed that &lt;a href=\"Aldous%20Huxley\"&gt;Aldous Huxley&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Brave%20New%20World\"&gt;Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;\" (1932) must be partly derived from \"We\". However, in a letter to Christopher Collins in 1962, Huxley says that he wrote \"Brave New World\" as a reaction to H. G. Wells's utopias long before he had heard of \"We\".\n&lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Vonnegut\"&gt;Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt; said that in writing \"&lt;a href=\"Player%20Piano%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Player Piano&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952), he \"cheerfully ripped off the plot of \"&lt;a href=\"Brave%20New%20World\"&gt;Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;\", whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's \"We\"\". &lt;a href=\"Ayn%20Rand\"&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Anthem%20%28novella%29\"&gt;Anthem&lt;/a&gt;\" (1938) has many significant similarities to \"We\" (&lt;a href=\"Anthem%20%28novella%29%23History\"&gt;detailed here&lt;/a&gt;), although it is stylistically and thematically different. &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Nabokov\"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Invitation%20to%20a%20Beheading\"&gt;Invitation to a Beheading&lt;/a&gt;\" may suggest a dystopian society with some similarities to Zamyatin's; Nabokov read \"We\" while writing \"Invitation to a Beheading\".\nOrwell began \"&lt;a href=\"Nineteen%20Eighty-Four\"&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/a&gt;\" (1949) some eight months after he read \"We\" in a French translation and wrote a review of it. Orwell is reported as \"saying that he was taking it as the model for his next novel\". Brown writes that for Orwell and certain others, \"We\" \"appears to have been \"the\" crucial literary experience\". Shane states that \"Zamyatin's influence on Orwell is beyond dispute\". Robert Russell, in an overview of the criticism of \"We\", concludes that \"\"1984\" shares so many features with \"We\" that there can be no doubt about its general debt to it\", however, there is a minority of critics who view the similarities between \"We\" and \"1984\" as \"entirely superficial\". Further, Russell finds that \"Orwell's novel is both bleaker and more topical than Zamyatin's, lacking entirely that ironic humour that pervades the Russian work\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Right%20Stuff%20%28book%29\"&gt;The Right Stuff&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979), &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Wolfe\"&gt;Tom Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; describes \"We\" as a \"marvelously morose novel of the future\" featuring an \"omnipotent spaceship\" called the \"Integral\" whose \"designer is known only as 'D-503, Builder of the Integral'\". Wolfe goes on to use the \"Integral\" as a metaphor for the Soviet &lt;a href=\"launch%20vehicle\"&gt;launch vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, the Soviet space programme, or the Soviet Union.\n&lt;a href=\"Jerome%20K.%20Jerome\"&gt;Jerome K. Jerome&lt;/a&gt; has been cited as an influence on Zamyatin's novel. Jerome's short story \"The New Utopia\" (1891) describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarish &lt;a href=\"egalitarianism\"&gt;egalitarianism&lt;/a&gt;, where men and women are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin's \"unifs\") and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has a name: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as in \"We\". Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome has anyone with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation\u2014something of central importance in \"We\". There is a shared depiction by both Jerome and Zamyatin that individual and, by extension, familial love is a disruptive and humanizing force. Jerome's works were translated in Russia three times before 1917. Jerome's \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Men%20in%20a%20Boat\"&gt;Three Men in a Boat&lt;/a&gt;\" is a set book in Russian schools.\nIn 1998, the first English translation of \"&lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Days\"&gt;Cursed Days&lt;/a&gt;\", a diary kept in secret by &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; Russian author &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bunin\"&gt;Ivan Bunin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. In a foreword, the diary's English translator, Thomas Gaiton Marullo, described \"Cursed Days\" as a rare example of &lt;a href=\"dystopia\"&gt;dystopia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"nonfiction\"&gt;nonfiction&lt;/a&gt; and pointed out multiple parallels between the secret diary kept by Bunin and the diary kept by D-503.\nPublication history.\nZamyatin's literary position deteriorated throughout the 1920s, and he was eventually allowed to emigrate to Paris in 1931, probably after the intercession of &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Gorky\"&gt;Maxim Gorky&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe novel was first published in English in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York in a translation by &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Zilboorg\"&gt;Gregory Zilboorg&lt;/a&gt;, but its first publication in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; had to wait until 1988, when &lt;a href=\"glasnost\"&gt;glasnost&lt;/a&gt; resulted in it appearing alongside &lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Nineteen%20Eighty-Four\"&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/a&gt;\". A year later, \"We\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Brave%20New%20World\"&gt;Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;\" were published together in a combined edition.\nIn 1994, the novel received a &lt;a href=\"Prometheus%20Award\"&gt;Prometheus Award&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Hall of Fame\" category.\nAdaptations.\nFilms.\nThe German TV network &lt;a href=\"ZDF\"&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; adapted the novel for a TV movie in 1982, under the German title \"&lt;a href=\"Wir%20%28film%29\"&gt;Wir&lt;/a&gt;\" (English: We).\nThe novel has also been adapted, by Alain Bourret, a French director, into a short film called \"The Glass Fortress\" (2016). \"The Glass Fortress\" is an experimental film that employs a technique known as &lt;a href=\"Freeze%20frame%20shot\"&gt;freeze frame&lt;/a&gt;, and is shot in &lt;a href=\"black-and-white\"&gt;black-and-white&lt;/a&gt;, which help support the grim atmosphere of the story's &lt;a href=\"Dystopia\"&gt;dystopian society&lt;/a&gt;. The film is technically similar to \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Jet%C3%A9e\"&gt;La Jet\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962), directed by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Marker\"&gt;Chris Marker&lt;/a&gt;, and refers somewhat to \"&lt;a href=\"THX%201138\"&gt;THX 1138&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971), by &lt;a href=\"George%20Lucas\"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, in the \"religious appearance of the Well Doer\". According to film critic &lt;a href=\"Sivakumar%20Vijayan%23Career\"&gt;Isabelle Arnaud&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Glass Fortress\" has a special atmosphere underlining a story of thwarted love that will be long remembered.\nA Russian film adaptation, directed by Hamlet Dulyan and starring &lt;a href=\"Egor%20Koreshkov\"&gt;Egor Koreshkov&lt;/a&gt;, is in post-production as of May 2021, with a projected release sometime in the fall.\nTheatre.\nMontreal company Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Deuxi\u00e8me R\u00e9alit\u00e9 produced an adaptation of the novel in 1996, adapted and directed by &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Marine\"&gt;Alexandre Marine&lt;/a&gt;, under the title \"Nous Autres\".\nMusic.\nReleased in 2015, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Glass%20Fortress%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Glass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;\" is a musical and narrative adaptation of the novel by R\u00e9mi Orts Project and Alan B.\nLegacy.\n\"We\", the 1921 &lt;a href=\"Russian%20novel\"&gt;Russian novel&lt;/a&gt;, directly inspired:"
