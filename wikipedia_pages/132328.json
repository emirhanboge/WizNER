    "text": "North Middleton Township is a &lt;a href=\"township%20%28Pennsylvania%29\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 11,143 at the 2010 census.\nGeography.\nThe township is in north-central Cumberland County, bordered by &lt;a href=\"Perry%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Perry County&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the borough of &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt;, the Cumberland County seat, to the south. The Perry County line follows the crest of &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Mountain%20%28Pennsylvania%29\"&gt;Blue Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Conodoguinet%20Creek\"&gt;Conodoguinet Creek&lt;/a&gt;, a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Susquehanna%20River\"&gt;Susquehanna River&lt;/a&gt;, crosses the southern part of the township just north of Carlisle, making several large bends. The &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Interstate%2076%20%28east%29\"&gt;Interstate 76&lt;/a&gt;) crosses the township between the creek and Carlisle, with the closest access being in &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20Township%2C%20Cumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Middlesex Township&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nHalf of the &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%20Fairgrounds\"&gt;Carlisle Fairgrounds&lt;/a&gt; and most of the &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%20Barracks\"&gt;Carlisle Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, containing the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army%20War%20College\"&gt;U.S. Army War College&lt;/a&gt;, are located in the township adjacent to Carlisle borough.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.43%, is water.\n&lt;a href=\"unincorporated%20community\"&gt;Unincorporated communities&lt;/a&gt; in North Middleton Township:\nHistory.\nWhen Cumberland County was founded in 1750, it originally consisted of three townships: East and West Pennsborough Townships, and Middleton Township. In 1810, due to population increase, Middleton Township was divided into North Middleton Township to the north of Carlisle, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Middleton%20Township%2C%20Cumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;South Middleton Township&lt;/a&gt; to the south. In the mid 18th century, the area that is now the township was inhabited primarily by &lt;a href=\"Scotch-Irish%20American\"&gt;Scotch Irish&lt;/a&gt; settlers who were granted &lt;a href=\"land%20patent\"&gt;land patent&lt;/a&gt;s in that region by the family of &lt;a href=\"William%20Penn\"&gt;William Penn&lt;/a&gt;, the proprietors of Pennsylvania at the time. The rapid settlement of this area at that time was the result of the Penns' plan to keep the Scotch Irish who were viewed as rowdy and unsophisticated out of the more refined &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; counties to the southeast. Thus, by the late 1700s, the population west of the Susquehanna River was composed almost exclusively of Scotch Irish settlers.\nAs was common of most areas in the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Valley\"&gt;Cumberland Valley&lt;/a&gt; at that time, most early settlers of North Middleton Township were farmers by trade, and perhaps the area's most lasting legacy was the great quantity and quality of barns built there. The majority of these barns exhibited a style that came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20barn\"&gt;Pennsylvania barn&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these barns were built during the late 1800s, but a fair number still exist in the township today. According to a township publication from 1976, there were 78 barns still standing in the area, and although this number has dwindled since that time, there are still several dozen barns in the township today, and agriculture still remains a substantial sector in the region's economy.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 10,197 people, 4,039 households, and 2,948 families residing in the township. The &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; was 433.3 people per square mile (167.3/km). There were 4,213 housing units at an average density of 179.0/sq\u00a0mi (69.1/km). The racial makeup of the township was 93.05% &lt;a href=\"White%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, 3.41% &lt;a href=\"African%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;, 0.20% &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, 1.55% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, 0.11% &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islander%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, 0.63% from &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, and 1.06% from two or more races. &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Latino%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; of any race were 1.48% of the population.\nThere were 4,039 households, out of which 31.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.6% were &lt;a href=\"Marriage\"&gt;married couples&lt;/a&gt; living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.0% were non-families. 22.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 2.89.\nIn the township the population was spread out, with 23.3% under the age of 18, 6.8% from 18 to 24, 29.0% from 25 to 44, 27.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.1 males.\nThe median income for a household in the township was $50,010, and the median income for a family was $56,846. Males had a median income of $37,880 versus $25,791 for females. The &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the township was $22,947. About 1.4% of families and 2.5% of the population were below the &lt;a href=\"poverty%20line\"&gt;poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, including 1.9% of those under age 18 and 4.0% of those age 65 or over."
