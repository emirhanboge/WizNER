    "text": "Wanderers Football Club is a senior &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, playing in Division 2B of the &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20League%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;All-Ireland League&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the oldest rugby clubs in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, however its exact date of foundation is open to question. In 1860 a team by the name of Wanderers played against &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20University%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Dublin University&lt;/a&gt;. However the current team gives its foundation date as 1870. While the link between the two teams is unclear, they both seem to have been founded by former Dublin University players. In 1879 Wanderers were among the founding members of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Irish Rugby Football Union&lt;/a&gt;. They have also regularly provided international players for &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, including five captains. In &lt;a href=\"1959%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ronnie%20Dawson%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ronnie Dawson&lt;/a&gt; also went on to captain the &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt;. They have also provided one captain each for both &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1880 Wanderers have shared &lt;a href=\"Lansdowne%20Road\"&gt;Lansdowne Road&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lansdowne%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Lansdowne Football Club&lt;/a&gt;, with each club having their own clubhouse at opposite ends of the ground. However, since 1974 the ground itself has been owned by the IRFU.\nNotable players.\nIreland.\nAt least 87 Wanderers players have represented &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. These include the following:\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nAs well as representing &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, several Wanderers players have also represented the &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt;. These include:\nVictoria Cross.\nThree former Wanderers players and &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; internationals have also been awarded the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt;. Crean and Johnston served with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; while Harvey served with the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Army\"&gt;Canadian Army&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;."
