    "text": "Jos\u00e9 \u00d3scar S\u00e1nchez Madan, born in &lt;a href=\"Marianao\"&gt;Marianao&lt;/a&gt; on 10 December 1961\nis a &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n journalist and author in several Cuban newspapers, and a regular contributor of the Miami-based independent news agency &lt;a href=\"CUBANET\"&gt;CUBANET&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs spokesman &lt;a href=\"Elizardo%20Sanchez\"&gt;Elizardo S\u00e1nchez Santa-Cruz&lt;/a&gt; of the Cuba human rights group &lt;a href=\"CCDHRN\"&gt;CCDHRN&lt;/a&gt; said, \u00d3scar S\u00e1nchez Madan was arrested on Friday April 13, 2007 and was convicted to four years of prison a few hours after his arrest by a secret court in an accelerated process in &lt;a href=\"Union%20de%20Reyes\"&gt;Union de Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, a village east of &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. He got no defence lawyer and no relatives were allowed to attend the lawsuit. He was convicted under the charges of \"&lt;a href=\"social%20dangerousness\"&gt;pre-criminal social danger&lt;/a&gt;\", a legal subterfuge that allows the Cuban authorities to imprison any citizen as a potential danger to society, even if they have not committed a crime. His arrest put the toll of imprisoned journalists up to 26 as of June 2007."
