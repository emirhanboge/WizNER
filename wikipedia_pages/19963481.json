    "text": "Jim Lang (1 October 1909 \u2013 22 December 1991) was a &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; number 8 who played club rugby for &lt;a href=\"Llanelli%20RFC\"&gt;Llanelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swansea%20RFC\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst with Llanelli he faced two touring Southern Hemisphere teams, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africans&lt;/a&gt; in 1931 and New Zealand in 1935.\nRugby career.\nLang was first capped for &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1931%20Five%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1931 Five Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; in a game against France. Under the captaincy of &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Bassett\"&gt;Jack Bassett&lt;/a&gt;, Wales won the game with ease, running in seven &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;. Lang was reselected two weeks later to face the Irish at &lt;a href=\"Ravenhill%20Stadium\"&gt;Ravenhill&lt;/a&gt;, and when Wales won the game they also won the tournament. Lang would remain unselected for his country for another four years, but in 1931 he played for Llanelli when they hosted the &lt;a href=\"1931-32%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour\"&gt;touring South Africans&lt;/a&gt;. Lang ran out against the Springboks with his brother, Will, but ended the game on the losing side.\nIn 1934 Lang was back in the Welsh team, adding some experience to a team which the game earlier with 13 new caps, had lost at home to England. Led by &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Davey\"&gt;Claude Davey&lt;/a&gt; and with the flair supplied by &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Cliff Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Wales beat Scotland at Murrayfield. This game was the first of ten sequential games that Lang would play for Wales stretching to 1937. His most memorable game during this period was Wales's win against the touring New Zealand team in 1935. Having already faced, and lost, to the All Blacks with Llanelli, Lang found himself selected to face the tourists for his country. It was a memorable win for Wales in a match filled with drama, that saw Wales losing with ten minutes remaining and their hooker stretchered off with a broken neck, only for the Welsh team to rally for a narrow win. Lang played his part with strong line-out play that allowed Wales to gain from good possession.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"
