    "text": "Lugarno is a &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"St%20George%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;St George&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Sydney\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, in the state of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Local%20government%20in%20Australia\"&gt;local government area&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Georges%20River%20Council\"&gt;Georges River Council&lt;/a&gt;, 23 kilometres south of the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20central%20business%20district\"&gt;Sydney central business district&lt;/a&gt;.\nSituated on the northern bank of the &lt;a href=\"Georges%20River\"&gt;Georges River&lt;/a&gt;, Lugarno is known for its large areas of bushland. &lt;a href=\"Peakhurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Peakhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peakhurst%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Peakhurst Heights&lt;/a&gt;, to the north, are the only adjoining suburbs. Nearby suburbs include &lt;a href=\"Alfords%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Alfords Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illawong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Illawong&lt;/a&gt; (on the other side of the Georges River), &lt;a href=\"Padstow%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Padstow Heights&lt;/a&gt; (on the other side of Salt Pan Creek) and &lt;a href=\"Oatley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Oatley&lt;/a&gt; (on the other side of Lime Kiln Bay).\nHistory.\nThe area now known as Lugarno lies either on the traditional lands of the &lt;a href=\"Dharug\"&gt;Dharug&lt;/a&gt; people or the coastal &lt;a href=\"Eora\"&gt;Eora&lt;/a&gt; people, both of whom spoke a common language. It lies close to the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Tharawal\"&gt;Tharawal&lt;/a&gt; on the south bank of the river. There was an unofficial Aboriginal settlement at nearby &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Pan%20Creek\"&gt;Salt Pan Creek&lt;/a&gt; for many years. &lt;a href=\"Georges%20River%20Council\"&gt;Georges River Council&lt;/a&gt; acknowledges that the Biddegal/Bidjigal/Bedegal clan of the Eora are the original inhabitants and custodians of all land and water in the Georges River region.\nLime Kiln Bay once had more extensive shell &lt;a href=\"midden\"&gt;midden&lt;/a&gt;s, made over centuries by local people, the bay gets its name from early settlers burning the shells to create &lt;a href=\"Calcium%20oxide\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;.There was an unofficial Aboriginal settlement at nearby &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Pan%20Creek\"&gt;Salt Pan Creek&lt;/a&gt; for many years.\nOne of the earliest contacts between British settlers and Aboriginal people occurred on 20 January 1788. &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Phillip\"&gt;Arthur Philip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Gidley%20King\"&gt;Philip Gidley King&lt;/a&gt;, leading a party of seamen from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt; rowing two open boats, explored the 'South-West Arm of Botany Bay' (now Georges River). They are now thought to have gone as far as Lime Kiln Bay, where they landed at two locations there, the first of which they called 'Lance Point'\u2014thought to be modern-day Gertrude Point, Lugarno\u2014where an altercation with local people occurred. Later the same day, there was a peaceful meeting at the head of Lime Kiln Bay. Not finding enough freshwater, around Botany Bay and its two 'arms', the colonists moved on to Port Jackson, where the settlement of Sydney began six days later.\nLugarno was named after &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Lugano\"&gt;Lake Lugano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; by surveyors &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Major Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (1792-1855) and &lt;a href=\"William%20Romaine%20Govett\"&gt;William Govett&lt;/a&gt; (1807-1848) in 1843. An extra 'r' was added for the suburb name. Thomas Lawrence was granted of land in 1831, on the western side of the peninsula near Salt Pan Creek. Land grants to the east and north were made in 1856 to T.G.Lee with , Frewin Sleath with , John Lushy with and J.P. Henning with .\nThe whole area between &lt;a href=\"Arncliffe%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Arncliffe&lt;/a&gt; and Lugarno was originally heavily timbered. Illawarra Road was built by convicts in 1841 and it ran through Gannon's Forest, down to the Georges River. The road from Arncliffe was later known as Gannon's Forest Road and today is known as Forest Road. The name has been retained in Old Illawarra Road, over the river in &lt;a href=\"Menai%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Menai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;. \nA &lt;a href=\"Cable%20ferry\"&gt;punt&lt;/a&gt; operated from Lugarno across the river from 1843. An established ferry serviced the area from 1887 to 1974, closing with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Alfords%20Point%20Bridge\"&gt;Alfords Point Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first captains of the ferry, Mike Hunt, resided in Koorabel St and was said to have walked his labrador down to the wharf every day. The suburb was developed into mainly residential in the 1960s when land was released for home sites.\nThe area now known as &lt;a href=\"H.%20V.%20Evatt\"&gt;H. V. Evatt&lt;/a&gt; Memorial Park lies on volcanic soil, a rarity in Sydney. It is the weathered remains of a &lt;a href=\"diatreme\"&gt;diatreme&lt;/a&gt;, a type of volcanic pipe. The area was a market garden until c.1961. The pond at the north end of the park was created as an irrigation dam. After the market garden became disused, the area was threatened by housing development, until it was saved as open space and sporting fields. The natural slope of the hill was altered by excavation and levelling to create level playing fields.\nAccording to a 2012 survey conducted by the governments of Australia and New Zealand, Lugarno has the most roundabouts per capita in the Southern Hemisphere. With a population of around 5500 and 7 roundabouts the ratio is 1:785, slightly beating out the Victorian town of Sausage Gully.\nChurches.\nSt Stephens Anglican Church, Lugarno-Peakhurst Uniting Church and Church of Samoa Parish of Sydney.\nCommercial area.\nLugarno has two small sets of shops.

The 943 service runs between Lugarno and &lt;a href=\"Hurstville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Hurstville&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Penshurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Penshurst&lt;/a&gt;, while the 942 service operates between Lugarno and &lt;a href=\"Campsie%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Campsie&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roselands%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Roselands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Wiley Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakemba%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Lakemba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belmore%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Belmore&lt;/a&gt;.\nSport and recreation.\nGannons Park is the home ground of 2 soccer clubs, Lugarno F.C. and Forest Rangers F.C. Evatt Park is the home ground of the St George Junior Baseball Club, Penshurst RSL Rugby League Club, and the Oatley Rugby Union Club. The Lugarno-Peakhurst Uniting Church organises a netball competition which takes place at Olds Park, &lt;a href=\"Penshurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Penshurst&lt;/a&gt;.\nLugarno is home to the Lugarno Football Club, one of the most prominent and respected clubs in the St George Football Association. In the most recent football season the club fielded some 42 teams (20 competition and 22 non-competition teams) and had more than 500 registered players and 102 team officials covering the age groups from the under 6's to the over 45's. The Club fields teams across both genders.\nPopulation.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232006\"&gt;2006 census&lt;/a&gt;, the population of Lugarno stood at 5,707. 19.1% of census respondents stated they were born overseas with the top countries of birth being United Kingdom 3.1%, China 1.9% and Greece 1.5%.
