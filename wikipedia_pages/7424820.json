    "text": "John Franklin Crowell (November 1, 1857 \u2013 August 6, 1931) served as president of Trinity College, the predecessor of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;, from 1887 to 1894. Crowell studied &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. Crowell is primarily known for overseeing Trinity's movement to &lt;a href=\"Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Durham, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and for reforming Trinity's curriculum, along with &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20L.%20Armstrong\"&gt;Joseph L. Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, to be more in line with the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; research university model. Toward that end Crowell persuaded the competing student literary societies to combine their libraries into a single college collection, where he personally catalogued the books and kept hours at a reference desk to encourage proper research methods. He also corrected the Latin in the college motto. Crowell increased the number of visiting lecturers at Trinity, and helped establish several academic student publications, one of which, the literary magazine \"The Archive\" is the second oldest such publication in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Crowell also served as the &lt;a href=\"head%20coach\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; program from 1888\u20131889, compiling a 3\u20132 record. After resigning from Duke, Crowell became head of the Department of &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sociology\"&gt;Sociology&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Smith%20College\"&gt;Smith College&lt;/a&gt;. He received an honorary &lt;a href=\"LL.D.\"&gt;LL.D.&lt;/a&gt; degree from Trinity in 1917."
