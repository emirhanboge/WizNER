    "title": "Realpolitik",
    "text": "Realpolitik (; ) is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of &lt;a href=\"Realism%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;realism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pragmatism\"&gt;pragmatism&lt;/a&gt;. It is often simply referred to as \"pragmatism\" in politics, e.g. \"pursuing pragmatic policies\". The term \"Realpolitik\" is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as &lt;a href=\"Coercion\"&gt;coercive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amorality\"&gt;amoral&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Machiavellianism%20%28politics%29\"&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Realpolitik\" was coined by &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Rochau\"&gt;Ludwig von Rochau&lt;/a&gt;, a German writer and politician in the 19th century. His 1853 book \"Grunds\u00e4tze der Realpolitik angewendet auf die staatlichen Zust\u00e4nde Deutschlands\" (\u201cPrinciples of \"realpolitik\" applied to the national state of affairs of Germany\u201d) describes the meaning of the term: \nHistorian John Bew suggests that much of what stands for modern \"Realpolitik\" today deviates from the original meaning of the term. \"Realpolitik\" emerged in mid-19th century Europe from the collision of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; with state formation and power politics. The concept, Bew argues, was an early attempt at answering the conundrum of how to achieve &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; enlightened goals in a world that does not follow liberal enlightened rules.\nPublicist, journalist and liberal political reformer Von Rochau coined the term in 1853 and added a second volume in 1869 that further refined his earlier arguments. Rochau, exiled in Paris until the 1848 uprising, returned during the revolution and became a well-known figure in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;National Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;. As the liberal gains of the 1848 revolutions fell victim to coercive governments or were swallowed by powerful social forces such as class, religion and nationalism, Rochau\u2014according to Bew\u2014began to think hard about how the work that had begun with such enthusiasm had failed to yield any lasting results.\nHe said that the great achievement of the Enlightenment had been to show that might is not necessarily right. The mistake liberals made was to assume that the law of the strong had suddenly evaporated simply because it had been shown to be unjust. Rochau wrote that \"to bring down the walls of Jericho, the Realpolitiker knows the simple pickaxe is more useful than the mightiest trumpet\". Rochau's concept was seized upon by German thinkers in the mid and late 19th century and became associated with &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;'s statecraft in &lt;a href=\"unification%20of%20Germany\"&gt;unifying Germany&lt;/a&gt; in the mid 19th century. By 1890, usage of the word \"Realpolitik\" was widespread, yet increasingly detached from its original meaning.\nPolitical realism in international relations.\nWhereas \"Realpolitik\" refers to political practice, the concept of &lt;a href=\"Realism%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;political realism in international relations&lt;/a&gt; refers to a theoretical framework aimed at offering explanations for events in the &lt;a href=\"international%20relations\"&gt;international relations&lt;/a&gt; domain. The theory of political realism proceeds from the assumption that states\u2014as actors in the international arena\u2014pursue their interests by practicing \"Realpolitik\". Conversely, \"Realpolitik\" can be described as the exercise of policies that are in line with accepted theories of political realism. In either case, the working hypothesis is generally that policy is chiefly based on the pursuit, possession and application of power (see also &lt;a href=\"power%20politics\"&gt;power politics&lt;/a&gt;). However, some international relations realists, such as &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Waltz\"&gt;Kenneth Waltz&lt;/a&gt;, have viewed state policy in terms of the pursuit of survival or security, rather than the pursuit of power for its own sake.\nHistory and branches.\nSee &lt;a href=\"political%20realism\"&gt;political realism&lt;/a&gt; for branches and antecedents more relevant to contemporary diplomacy and the particular modern, international relations paradigm.\nEurope.\nIn the United States, the term is often analogous to &lt;a href=\"power%20politics\"&gt;power politics&lt;/a&gt; while in Germany \"Realpolitik\" has a somewhat less negative connotation, referring to realistic politics in opposition to idealistic (or unrealistic) politics. It is particularly associated with the era of 19th century &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. \"Realpolitik\" policies were employed in response to the failed &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;revolutions of 1848&lt;/a&gt; as means to strengthen states and tighten social order.\nThe most famous German advocate of \"Realpolitik\", what was uniquely possible and the applied means to achieve it, was &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;, the first Chancellor (1862\u20131890) to &lt;a href=\"William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;Wilhelm I&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Kingdom of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. Bismarck used \"Realpolitik\" in his quest to achieve Prussian dominance in Germany. He manipulated political issues such as the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Question\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt; and the Hohenzollern candidature to antagonize other countries and cause wars if necessary to attain his goals. Such policies are characteristic of Bismarck, demonstrating a pragmatic view of the \"real\" political world. Another example was his willingness to adopt some social policies of the socialists such as employee insurance and pensions; in doing so, he used small changes from the top down to avoid the possibility of major change from the bottom up. Likewise, Prussia's seemingly illogical move of not demanding territory from a defeated Austria, a move that later led to the &lt;a href=\"unification%20of%20Germany\"&gt;unification of Germany&lt;/a&gt;, is an oft-cited example of \"Realpolitik\".\n&lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to annex the predominantly-German region of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Sudetenland\"&gt;Sudetenland&lt;/a&gt; in 1938 may also be described as \"Realpolitik\". At first, Hitler unsuccessfully demanded for Czechoslovak President &lt;a href=\"Edvard%20Bene%C5%A1\"&gt;Edvard Bene\u0161&lt;/a&gt; to hand over that region of the country. However, &lt;a href=\"British%20Prime%20Minister\"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neville%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Neville Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; subsequently gave the Sudetenland to Hitler in the ultimately-unsuccessful hope of preventing a war as codified in the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Agreement\"&gt;Munich Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. With Britain a guarantor of Czechoslovak independence, Hitler knew that Bene\u0161's opinion on the matter was immaterial if Chamberlain was prepared to give what Hitler desired.\n&lt;a href=\"E.%20H.%20Carr\"&gt;E. H. Carr&lt;/a&gt; was a liberal realist and &lt;a href=\"left-wing\"&gt;left-wing&lt;/a&gt; British historian and &lt;a href=\"international%20relations\"&gt;international relations&lt;/a&gt; theorist who argued for realistic international over utopian policies. Carr described realism as the acceptance that what exists is right; he thus argued that in politics, realism meant that there is no moral dimension and that what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong. Carr was convinced that the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt; were destined to win the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and, under the grounds of \"Realpolitik\", approved of British Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"David%20Lloyd%20George\"&gt;David Lloyd George&lt;/a&gt;'s opposition to War Secretary &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt;'s support for military help to the anti-Bolshevik &lt;a href=\"White%20movement\"&gt;White movement&lt;/a&gt;. In Carr's opinion, Churchill's support of the anti-Bolsheviks was folly, as Russia was likely to be a great power once more under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.\nUnited States.\nAmerican \"Realpolitik\" began in the 1960s with the influence of Polish-American &lt;a href=\"Zbigniew%20Brzezinski\"&gt;Zbigniew Brzezinski&lt;/a&gt;, later National Security Adviser to &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Carter\"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to &lt;a href=\"McCarthyism\"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;-era hostility and &lt;a href=\"John%20Foster%20Dulles\"&gt;John Foster Dulles&lt;/a&gt;'s talk of the military \"liberation\" of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt;, Brzezinski proposed \"peaceful engagement\" with the Soviet Union while he advised Presidents &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Brzezinski, uninterested in promoting anti-Soviet propaganda for the benefit of the United States, felt the United States would be more successful through frequent interactions with regimes and people under communist rule. Brzezinski knew the tough economic realities of those living in the Eastern Bloc, particularly the permanent shortage of goods, and that their attachment to the Soviet Union was born of historic necessity, rather than common ideology. Brzezinski suggested enticing these countries economically and through educational and cultural exchanges, which would appeal to intellectuals, followed by favoritism for regimes showing signs of liberalization or less reliance on Moscow. Through that approach, Brzezinski \"offered a realistic, evolutionary alternative to empty political rhetoric.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Henry%20Kissinger\"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt; has been credited with formally introducing the policy of \"Realpolitik\" to the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; as Secretary of State to &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;. In that context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner, rather than on the basis of political doctrine or ethics such as Nixon's diplomacy with the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; despite American opposition to &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; and the previous doctrine of &lt;a href=\"containment\"&gt;containment&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is Kissinger's use of &lt;a href=\"shuttle%20diplomacy\"&gt;shuttle diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"1973%20Arab-Israeli%20war\"&gt;1973 Arab-Israeli war&lt;/a&gt;, when he persuaded the Israelis to withdraw partially from the Sinai in deference to the political realities created by the oil crisis.\nKissinger himself said that he had never used the term \"Realpolitik\" and stated that it is used by both liberal and realist foreign policy thinkers to label, criticize and facilitate a choosing of sides. Kissinger had looked at what he implemented while he served as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor not in the confines of making \"Realpolitik\" a standard policy, but within the terms of being a statesman. That political mindset can be seen in Kissinger's book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20World%20Restored\"&gt;A World Restored&lt;/a&gt;\" and was pointed out by historian &lt;a href=\"John%20Bew%20%28historian%29\"&gt;John Bew&lt;/a&gt; in his book \"Realpolitik\". Kissinger went on to say that the role of the statesman is \"the ability to recognize the real relationship of forces and to make this knowledge serve his ends.\"\nIn that context, one can see how \"Realpolitik\" principles can influence American policy but not as standard policy. The reach and influence of \"Realpolitik\" is found instead in pragmatic and flexible policy that changes to the needs of the situation. That type of policymaking could be seen as recently as in the administration of &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. Bew made note of that direction in the &lt;a href=\"Obama%20administration\"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;, when Obama's chief of staff, &lt;a href=\"Rahm%20Emanuel\"&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt;, remarked in an article in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" that everyone wanted to break it down into contrasts of idealist and realist, but \"if you had to put him in a category, he's probably more realpolitik, like &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;Bush 41&lt;/a&gt; [...] You\u2019ve got to be cold-blooded about the self-interests of your nation.\"\n\"Realpolitik\" is distinct from ideological politics in that it is not dictated by a fixed set of rules but instead tends to be goal-oriented, limited only by practical exigencies. Since \"Realpolitik\" is ordered toward the most practical means of securing national interests, it can often entail compromising on ideological principles. For example, during the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, the United States often supported authoritarian regimes that were &lt;a href=\"human%20rights%20violations\"&gt;human rights violators&lt;/a&gt; to secure theoretically the greater national interest of regional stability. After the end of the Cold War, this practice continued.\nMost recently, former Ambassador &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Ross\"&gt;Dennis Ross&lt;/a&gt; advocated that approach to foreign policy in his 2007 book \"Statecraft: And How to Restore America's Standing in the World\". For the purposes of contrast and speaking in &lt;a href=\"ideal%20type\"&gt;ideal type&lt;/a&gt;s, political &lt;a href=\"ideologue\"&gt;ideologue&lt;/a&gt;s would tend to favor principle over other considerations. Such individuals or groups can reject compromises that they see as the abandonment of their ideals and so may sacrifice political gain, in favor of adhering to principles that they believe to be constitutive of long-term goals.\nChina.\nChina has a \"realistic\" tradition dating back thousands of years. Often referred to as &lt;a href=\"Legalism%20%28Chinese%20philosophy%29\"&gt;Chinese Legalism&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of its content may be most readily recognized by Western viewers through one of its kindred, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20War\"&gt;The Art of War&lt;/a&gt;\". Chinese administrative organization influenced Western administrative practices not later than the 12th century, playing a significant role in the development of the modern state, including use of the examination.\nStarting in the &lt;a href=\"Spring%20and%20Autumn%20period\"&gt;Spring and Autumn period&lt;/a&gt; (771\u2013476/403 BC), a trend of \"realistic\" reformers were taken on to advance the material interest of their respective &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Warring%20States\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Qin%20state\"&gt;Qin state&lt;/a&gt; founding the first Chinese Empire, &lt;a href=\"Qin%20dynasty\"&gt;Qin dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in 221 BCE, ending China's &lt;a href=\"Warring%20States%20period\"&gt;Warring States period&lt;/a&gt;. The political theory developed during the era, including that of &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucianism&lt;/a&gt; would influence every dynasty thereafter.\nThose termed Legalist are more purely \"Realpolitikal\" in contrast to Confucianism and include non-legal &lt;a href=\"Shen%20Pu-hai\"&gt;Shen Pu-hai&lt;/a&gt; derived political technique, which charges the ruler engage in &lt;a href=\"Wu%20wei\"&gt;passive observation&lt;/a&gt; to determine facts rather than take on too much himself. &lt;a href=\"Sinologist\"&gt;Sinologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herrlee%20G.%20Creel\"&gt;Herrlee G. Creel&lt;/a&gt; writes: \"If one wishes to exaggerate, it would no doubt be possible to translate (foundational Realist) Shen Buhai's term Shu, or &lt;a href=\"Scientific%20technique\"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt;, as '&lt;a href=\"Scientific%20method\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;', and argue that Pu-hai was the first political scientist,\" though Creel does \"not care to go this far\".\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, the prevalent philosophy had dictated war as a gentleman's activity; military commanders were instructed to respect what they perceived to be Heaven's laws in battle. For example, when &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Xiang%20of%20Song\"&gt;Duke Xiang of Song&lt;/a&gt; was at war with the state of Chu during the Warring States period, he declined an opportunity to attack the enemy force (commanded by Zhu) while they were crossing a river.\nThe Qin disregarded this military tradition, taking advantage of their enemy's weaknesses.\nSingapore.\nAccording to Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, \"Chua Beng Huat (1997) argued that the rhetoric of pragmatism in Singapore is ideological and hegemonic in nature, adopted and disseminated in the public sphere by the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Action%20Party\"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP) government and institutionalized throughout the state in all its administrative, planning and policy-making functions. It is suggested that by doggedly describing itself as pragmatic, the Singapore state is actually disguising its ideological work and political nature through an assertion of the absence of ideology and politics. Chan Heng Chee (1975) earlier described Singapore as a depoliticized \"administrative state\", where ideology and politics had triumphantly been replaced by rational and scientific modes of public administration\"."
