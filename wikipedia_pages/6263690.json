    "text": "Meisterschwanden is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in the district of &lt;a href=\"Lenzburg%20%28district%29\"&gt;Lenzburg&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;canton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThere were two &lt;a href=\"neolithic\"&gt;neolithic&lt;/a&gt; lake side settlements, at \"Seerose\" and \"Erlenh\u00f6lzli\", near the modern Meisterschwanden. Both sites were discovered from archeological digs on the lake shore. Additionally, at the \"Erlenh\u00f6lzli\" site, divers discovered traces of &lt;a href=\"Pfyn%20culture\"&gt;Pfyn culture&lt;/a&gt; ceramics, stone tools and several artifacts made of wood, including a bow and arrow fragment all from about 3,600 BC.\nMeisterschwanden is first mentioned in 1173 as \"Meistersvanc\" though this comes from a 14th Century copy of the original. In 1179 it was mentioned as \"Maestirwanch\". In 1363 the &lt;a href=\"Zwing%20und%20Bann\"&gt;Twingherrschaft&lt;/a&gt; transferred from the lords of Meisterschwanden to the Lords of &lt;a href=\"Hallwyl%20Castle\"&gt;Hallwyl&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"High%2C%20middle%20and%20low%20justice\"&gt;high court&lt;/a&gt; rights came to &lt;a href=\"Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; in 1415. During the second &lt;a href=\"Toggenburg%20War\"&gt;Villmergen war&lt;/a&gt; in 1712, &lt;a href=\"Fahrwangen\"&gt;Fahrwangen&lt;/a&gt; was used as a camp by the &lt;a href=\"Reformation%20in%20Switzerland\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; troops. As the Catholic troops attacked, according to legend, the women of Fahrwangen and Meisterschwanden marched out to join the soldiers. The &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; Bernese troops were so impressed with the valor of the women, that they granted them a day when the women could command. Since then, on the second Sunday in January they have celebrated the \"Meitlisunntig\" (Girls' Sunday). On this day, women from both villages run through the streets carrying nets. Any man who is captured in a net must pay his \"L\u00f6segelds\" or ransom (often in the form of alcoholic drinks) to get free.\nA chapel was already in the village before 1300. Until 1817 it was part of the &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Seengen\"&gt;Seengen&lt;/a&gt;, but then formed its own parish. The &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Reformed%20Church\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1820-22 and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; church was built in 1977.\nEconomically, the village was dependent on agriculture, which was supplemented by fishing and some &lt;a href=\"viticulture\"&gt;viticulture&lt;/a&gt;. In the 18th Century, small scale cotton processing businesses appeared in the village. This was replaced in 1850 by &lt;a href=\"straw%20plaiting\"&gt;straw goods manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of the 21st Century, there are some small and medium enterprises as well as day tourism (2 hotels on the lake) in the village.\nThe steam boat navigation on the Lake Hallwyl began in 1888.
