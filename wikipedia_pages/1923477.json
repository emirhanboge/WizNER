    "text": "Toms River Regional Schools is a comprehensive regional public &lt;a href=\"school%20district\"&gt;school district&lt;/a&gt; primarily located in the quickly growing coastal community of &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Toms River&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Ocean County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, United States, along the state's &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20Shore\"&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The district includes &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Toms River&lt;/a&gt; and the adjoining boroughs of &lt;a href=\"Beachwood%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Beachwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Beach%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Toms%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;South Toms River&lt;/a&gt;. It is the largest suburban school district in the state, and the fourth largest school district in New Jersey (after &lt;a href=\"Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Newark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Jersey City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Paterson&lt;/a&gt;). It is also the largest school district in the state that is not an &lt;a href=\"Abbott%20District\"&gt;Abbott District&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the 2018\u201319 school year, the district, comprising 18 schools, had an enrollment of 15,472 students and 1,171.6 classroom teachers (on an &lt;a href=\"full-time%20equivalent\"&gt;FTE&lt;/a&gt; basis), for a &lt;a href=\"student%E2%80%93teacher%20ratio\"&gt;student\u2013teacher ratio&lt;/a&gt; of 13.2:1.\nThe district has three high schools -- &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%20High%20School%20South\"&gt;Toms River High School South&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%20High%20School%20North\"&gt;Toms River High School North&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%20High%20School%20East\"&gt;Toms River High School East&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as three middle schools\u2014Toms River Intermediate School East, Toms River Intermediate School North (formerly Intermediate West), and Toms River Intermediate School South. With the opening of Intermediate South in 2005, all sixth grade classes were shifted from the district's 12 elementary schools to the three middle schools in order to alleviate overcrowding. Also at that time, Intermediate West was renamed Intermediate North. Intermediate East and Intermediate North are currently the two most populous middle schools in New Jersey.\nTo raise money for the schools, the district created &lt;a href=\"Toms%20River%20Fest\"&gt;Toms River Fest&lt;/a&gt;, a major festival held during the summer in 2005, 2006 and 2008.\nThe district is classified by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20Education\"&gt;New Jersey Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; as being in &lt;a href=\"District%20Factor%20Group\"&gt;District Factor Group&lt;/a&gt; \"DE\", the fifth-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common &lt;a href=\"socioeconomic\"&gt;socioeconomic&lt;/a&gt; characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Seaside%20Park%20School%20District\"&gt;Seaside Park School District&lt;/a&gt; closed in 2010, a sending / receiving relationship was established to allow students in grades K-6 from &lt;a href=\"Seaside%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Seaside Park&lt;/a&gt; to attend the Toms River Schools. In 2017, the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Superior%20Court%2C%20Appellate%20Division\"&gt;Appellate Division&lt;/a&gt; affirmed a decision by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20Education\"&gt;New Jersey Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; allowing students from Seaside Park the option of attending school for grades K-6 in either Toms River or in the &lt;a href=\"Lavallette%20School%20District\"&gt;Lavallette School District&lt;/a&gt;, under the terms of a dual sending/receiving relationship. The Lavallette district had actively supported the proposal when the original petition was submitted in 2015 and the Appellate Division rejected the objections raised by the Toms River district, noting that no protest had been made when Seaside Park had submitted its original petition.\nToms River Regional Schools has denied continued outside requests for racially insensitive mascots depicting Native Americans to be retired, including the Toms River High School South Indians, Toms River Intermediate South Seminoles, and Washington Street Elementary School Warriors.\nSchools.\nSchools in the district (with 2019-20 enrollment data from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Center%20for%20Education%20Statistics\"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;) are:\nAdministration.\nFrank J. Roselli assumed the role of interim superintendent of schools on October 21, 2010, following the sudden retirement of longtime superintendent Michael J. Ritacco, who earlier that day surrendered to the FBI and was charged in an 18-count fraud indictment. Ritacco was accused and ultimately convicted of accepting between one and two million dollars in bribes from the school district's insurance broker. Roselli was appointed superintendent on January 18, 2011.\nIn the spring of 2013, after suffering a heart attack, Roselli announced his retirement. Thomas Gialanella was appointed interim superintendent, effective July 1, 2013, and Dr. Marianne Gaffney was appointed interim assistant superintendent, replacing Joseph Pizza as of August 1, 2013. Subsequently, due to Gialanella's inability to start on July 1, James Hauenstein was named Interim Superintendent for the month of July 2013.\nDavid Healy took over as permanent superintendent on July 1, 2014, after being named by the board on March 11, 2014. Healy had been superintendent in the &lt;a href=\"Matawan-Aberdeen%20Regional%20School%20District\"&gt;Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District&lt;/a&gt;.\nCore members of the district's administration are:\nBoard of education.\nThe district's &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20education\"&gt;board of education&lt;/a&gt;, with nine members, sets policy and oversees the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the day-to-day operation of the district. Seats on the district's board of education are allocated based on the population of the constituent municipalities, with six seats assigned to Toms River and the other three municipalities\u2014Beachwood, Pine Beach and South Toms River\u2014each assigned one seat.\nBennett Indoor Athletic Complex.\nThe Bennett Indoor Athletic Complex is an &lt;a href=\"air-supported%20structure\"&gt;air-supported structure&lt;/a&gt; that provides an indoor venue for &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; to the Toms River Regional Schools.
