    "text": "Silent Witness is a British &lt;a href=\"crime%20drama\"&gt;crime drama&lt;/a&gt; television series produced by the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on a team of &lt;a href=\"forensic%20pathology\"&gt;forensic pathology&lt;/a&gt; experts and their investigations into various crimes. First broadcast in 1996, the series was created by &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20McCrery\"&gt;Nigel McCrery&lt;/a&gt;, a former murder squad detective based in &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. (He later went on to create the series \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Tricks\"&gt;New Tricks&lt;/a&gt;\", with writer Roy Mitchell.) Twenty-four series of \"Silent Witness\" have been broadcast since 1996. &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Burton\"&gt;Amanda Burton&lt;/a&gt; starred as primary character Dr. Sam Ryan before leaving the show during the eighth series. Since her departure the series has featured an &lt;a href=\"ensemble%20cast\"&gt;ensemble cast&lt;/a&gt;, which initially consisted of &lt;a href=\"William%20Gaminara\"&gt;William Gaminara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Ward\"&gt;Tom Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emilia%20Fox\"&gt;Emilia Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and later on &lt;a href=\"David%20Caves\"&gt;David Caves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liz%20Carr\"&gt;Liz Carr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lintern\"&gt;Richard Lintern&lt;/a&gt; alongside Emilia Fox. At the end of series 23 Carr and Lintern both departed. The programme is broadcast in more than 235 territories, including &lt;a href=\"ABC%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, &lt;a href=\"Showcase%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Showcase&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knowledge%20Network\"&gt;Knowledge Network&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, &lt;a href=\"KRO\"&gt;KRO&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands, &lt;a href=\"TV%20One%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;TV One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prime%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Prime&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand, BBC First in South Africa and &lt;a href=\"BBC%20America\"&gt;BBC America&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. \"Silent Witness\" continues to achieve good audience ratings in the UK. In 2011, for example, Series 14 attracted an average audience of nine million viewers.\nBackground.\nThe main character in the original series was based on Professor Helen Whitwell, a forensic pathologist based in &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, who McCrery had known while serving as a police officer. The programme followed the activities of &lt;a href=\"forensic%20pathology\"&gt;pathologist&lt;/a&gt; Sam Ryan, played by &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Burton\"&gt;Amanda Burton&lt;/a&gt;, until she departed early in the eighth series.\nThere was a succession of regular supporting characters, changing almost every series, but Dr Leo Dalton (&lt;a href=\"William%20Gaminara\"&gt;William Gaminara&lt;/a&gt;) and Dr Harry Cunningham (&lt;a href=\"Tom%20Ward\"&gt;Tom Ward&lt;/a&gt;), who were introduced in the sixth series, continued as lead characters following Ryan's departure, with Dalton replacing her as professor.\nA new character, Dr Nikki Alexander (&lt;a href=\"Emilia%20Fox\"&gt;Emilia Fox&lt;/a&gt;), was introduced in mid-series eight. While working as a forensic anthropologist, she appropriates facilities and software in the pathology department to analyse an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; find, with the belated, bemused and begrudging approval of Dalton. Dr Alexander is able to assist in a set of cases being investigated by the team, as it turns out she has \"worked in forensic pathology in &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; for six months\" and is certified by the Home Office to practise. She eventually overcomes Leo's reluctance and, with Harry's support, is offered and accepts a position on the team.\nBefore the sixteenth series begins Harry has left to accept a position in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. He is succeeded by forensics expert Jack Hodgson (&lt;a href=\"David%20Caves\"&gt;David Caves&lt;/a&gt;) and his assistant Clarissa Mullery (&lt;a href=\"Liz%20Carr\"&gt;Liz Carr&lt;/a&gt;). At the climax of the sixteenth series Leo is killed in an explosion. His replacement, Dr Thomas Chamberlain (&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lintern\"&gt;Richard Lintern&lt;/a&gt;), is introduced at the start of the seventeenth series.\nAlthough the show focuses heavily on areas of pathology, the police also have a presence in each case. During later series of the show detectives and investigators tend to differ from episode to episode, with guest artists appearing in these roles. However, during the early years of the show several characters appeared regularly to investigate each case.\nThe first three series were set in &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. This changed to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; from the start of the fourth series, following Sam as she took up an academic position in the Lyell Centre, the Pathology Department of UCL. The programme remained in an academic setting until the end of series 16 when the Lyell appeared to have become separated from the University and operated as a stand alone institution.\nEach series is typically made up of a series of two-part stories. The first nine series typically featured eight episodes (four two-part stories), increased to ten episodes (five two-part stories) from the tenth series onwards.\nIn 1998 the writer John Milne received an &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Award\"&gt;Edgar Award&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Writers%20of%20America\"&gt;Mystery Writers of America&lt;/a&gt; for the second series episode \"Blood, Sweat and Tears\". In the United States the series airs during 'Mystery Monday' on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20America\"&gt;BBC America&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic.\nThe theme music from series 2 onwards is entitled \"Silencium\" and is performed by &lt;a href=\"John%20Harle\"&gt;John Harle&lt;/a&gt;. The arrangement, for chamber orchestra and &lt;a href=\"soprano%20saxophone\"&gt;soprano saxophone&lt;/a&gt; solo, was first performed as part of the &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20Festival\"&gt;Canterbury Festival&lt;/a&gt; on 22 October 2011. The vocal section is performed by &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Leonard%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Sarah Leonard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe incidental music used in the series is written by the BAFTA-nominated composer &lt;a href=\"Sheridan%20Tongue\"&gt;Sheridan Tongue&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical review.\nAn episode first broadcast in April 2012 attracted criticism for its violent and sadistic content. There were 632 complaints made about the fifteenth-series episode \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Silent%20Witness%20episodes%23ep127\"&gt;Redhill&lt;/a&gt;\", written by &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Whitmore\"&gt;Ed Whitmore&lt;/a&gt;, which included a scene depicting a sadistic sexual and murderous attack. The BBC was censured by the editorial committee of the &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Trust\"&gt;BBC Trust&lt;/a&gt;, who said in their report:\nThe BBC had responded to the initial criticism of the episode by saying that it took its responsibility to its audience \"extremely seriously\" and always tried to \"strike the right balance between compelling drama without being unnecessarily graphic\". It said that \"The final scene was not an attempt to gratuitously shock the audience;... We acknowledge that certain scenes may have been challenging, but we filmed and presented them in such a way as to make sure that although as a viewer the implication was there, it was never actually shown.\"\nThe show has also been criticised by reviewer Michael Hogan. Reviewing the first episode of series 21, he asked in the UK's \"Daily Telegraph\" how it had become the world\u2019s longest running crime drama, writing: \"In place of convincing dialogue or emotion, they instead exchanged meaningful stares\" and \"The leading pair were so wooden, they made the bodies on the autopsy slab look lively.\"\nHome media.\nIn Australia (Region 4), Series 1 through 23 have been released on DVD through Roadshow Entertainment, starting with Series 1 on 7 September 2006 through to Series 21 on 28 May 2018. Universal then took over the releases beginning with Series 22 on 20 November 2019, and have re-released some earlier seasons this time as individual seasons rather than 2 season editions. \nNovels.\nDuring the early years of the show, series creator McCrery wrote and published a number of tie-in novels relating to the series, following Sam Ryan (&lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Burton\"&gt;Amanda Burton&lt;/a&gt;) and Trevor Stewart (William Armstrong), as well as former main character Superintendent Tom Adams (&lt;a href=\"John%20McGlynn%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John McGlynn&lt;/a&gt;), and brand new character DS Stanley Sharman, with Burton generally appearing on the front cover of each novel. The fifth novel, due to be published in 2003, was placed on indefinite hold, and has never been released."
