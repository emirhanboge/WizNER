    "text": "Carlos Dawon Hyde (born September 20, 1990) is an &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%20Jaguars\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL). He played college football at &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20University\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; and was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; in the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2014 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh school career.\nHyde grew up in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cincinnati, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20High%20School%20%28Sharonville%2C%20Ohio%29\"&gt;Princeton High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sharonville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Sharonville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, for his freshman year. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"Naples%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Naples, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and attended &lt;a href=\"Naples%20High%20School\"&gt;Naples High School&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of high school. He rushed for 1,653 yards and 16 touchdowns for the &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team as a senior, and was named Player of the Year after his senior season by both the \"&lt;a href=\"Naples%20Daily%20News\"&gt;Naples Daily News&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20News-Press\"&gt;Ft. Myers News-Press&lt;/a&gt;\". He played on the 2007 Naples state championship winning team and 2008 regional finalist. He also played &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, ran track, and mentored elementary school children.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by &lt;a href=\"Rivals.com\"&gt;Rivals.com&lt;/a&gt;, he was rated as the second best &lt;a href=\"Fullback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt; in the nation. He committed to &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; over scholarship offers from the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20football\"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Hurricanes%20football\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nHyde enrolled at Ohio State in January 2010. Hyde played primarily as a backup running back in his first two seasons before breaking out in his junior season with 970 yards and 16 rushing touchdowns in less than 10 games after missing two because of an ankle issue. He was named second-team All-Big Ten that year.\nGoing into his senior season with high expectations, Hyde was suspended for the first three games of the season after being implicated in an incident at a local bar, though he was not criminally charged in the matter. Hyde returned from his suspension to finish the season strong with 1,282 yards and 14 touchdowns over his last eight games. On October 5, Hyde ran for his first 100-yard and multi-touchdown game of the season when he ran for 168 yards and three &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s when the Buckeyes played &lt;a href=\"2013%20Northwestern%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;Northwestern&lt;/a&gt;. Hyde ran for a season-high of 246 yards and four touchdowns against &lt;a href=\"2013%20Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20football%20team\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; on November 16. He followed that up with 226 rushing yards and a touchdown in the annual rivalry game against Michigan. He was a first-team All-&lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt; selection, and a third-team &lt;a href=\"All-America\"&gt;All-America&lt;/a&gt;n by the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional career.\n2014 NFL Draft.\nHyde was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; in the second round (57th overall) of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2014 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. He was the third running back to be selected in the 2014 NFL Draft after &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Sankey\"&gt;Bishop Sankey&lt;/a&gt;, who was selected by the Tennessee Titans, and &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Hill%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Jeremy Hill&lt;/a&gt;, who was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\n2014 season: Rookie year.\nThere were large expectations for Hyde coming into an already crowded backfield. With a large amount of depth at the position, Hyde had to compete against &lt;a href=\"Kendall%20Hunter\"&gt;Kendall Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LaMichael%20James\"&gt;LaMichael James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Lattimore\"&gt;Marcus Lattimore&lt;/a&gt;, and 49ers all-time leading rusher, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gore\"&gt;Frank Gore&lt;/a&gt;. A series of injuries would move Hyde up the depth chart to the back up running back behind Gore. Last season's backup running back Kendall Hunter tore his &lt;a href=\"anterior%20cruciate%20ligament\"&gt;ACL&lt;/a&gt; during training camp, Marcus Lattimore retired due to a previously suffered ACL and MCL tear in college, and LaMichael James sprained his elbow. James was later released by the team. In the season opener against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde rushed for 50 yards on seven carries and one touchdown. Over the next couple weeks, the team would not feature Hyde very much giving him a total of just seven carries. In Week 10 against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt; during a close game, the team turned to Frank Gore leaning on him, leaving Hyde on the bench for most of the game but Hyde showed a lot of promise rushing for 36 yards on four carries and a touchdown. After two consecutive losses, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;49ers&lt;/a&gt; were eliminated from playoffs so the team would look to get the young guys more reps. In Week 15 against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde was playing well until he was benched in the fourth quarter as a result of a sprained ankle and back injury he suffered during the game. Hyde missed the final two games of the season. He finished the season with 83 carries for 333 yards and four touchdowns.\n2015 season.\nAfter the 49ers chose not to re-sign &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gore\"&gt;Frank Gore&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde entered the season as the front runner to become the feature back, but he was in competition for the starting job against &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Davis%20%28running%20back%29\"&gt;Mike Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Bush\"&gt;Reggie Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href=\"Jarryd%20Hayne\"&gt;Jarryd Hayne&lt;/a&gt;. He was named starter for the 2015 season. In the season opener, Hyde had the best game of his career, rushing for a career-high 168 yards on 26 carries and two touchdowns, one touchdown coming on an amazing spin move, against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next few weeks, the team suffered two blowout losses on the road against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2015%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and a home loss to the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; as a result to the team focused on the passing game to score points, abandoning the running game. In Week 5 against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; the team was more balanced, Hyde rushed for 93 yards on 21 carries and one touchdown. Despite his successful game, the 49ers lost on a last minute touchdown pass from &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Manning\"&gt;Eli Manning&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Donnell\"&gt;Larry Donnell&lt;/a&gt; with 21 seconds on the clock. More bad news came after the loss Hyde fractured his foot during the game. He played the next two games dealing with the injury but was shut down in Week 8 and did not return for the rest of the season. He needed surgery to repair the stress fracture. On December 12, Hyde was placed on Injured Reserve. Hyde finished with 115 carries for 470 yards and three touchdowns.\n2016 season.\nHyde entered the 2016 season as one of the few bright spots on the 49ers offense. Hyde was expected to have a large volume of work as the 49ers starting running back, the team's new head coach &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Kelly\"&gt;Chip Kelly&lt;/a&gt;'s offense relies on a good rushing attack. In the season opener, the team shutout the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt; in a 28\u20130 victory, Hyde had a great game rushing for 88 yards and two touchdowns on \"Monday Night Football\". In Week 2, the 49ers faced the defending &lt;a href=\"NFC%20Champion\"&gt;NFC Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2016%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt; and their Top 10 defense. Hyde had a slow start to the game when he fumbled the ball and the defense returned it for a touchdown. He would then split playing time with &lt;a href=\"Shaun%20Draughn\"&gt;Shaun Draughn&lt;/a&gt; due to his fumble. The offense could not run the ball consistently in the first half. After halftime, the Panthers offense took off and the 49ers stopped running the ball in an attempt to make a comeback. Hyde didn't get many carries after that. He finished the game with 14 carries for 34 yards. In Week 3 against the divisional rival &lt;a href=\"2016%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde had a good game although the offense had a slow start to the game including Hyde, who only rushed for 23 yards in the first half. In the second half, the passing attack was ineffective against the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Seahawks\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Boom%20%28Seattle%20Seahawks%29\"&gt;Legion of Boom&lt;/a&gt;\", but Hyde and the rushing attack were more effective as the game got later, Hyde rushed for two eight-yard touchdowns in the fourth quarter. He finished with 21 carries for 103 yards and two touchdowns. Over the next two weeks, Hyde would keep his momentum rushing for 74 yards and one touchdown and 78 yards and one touchdown in Weeks 4 and 5 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; and Arizona Cardinals. The next week, Hyde rushed for 52 yards on 14 carries against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season\"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt;. In the game, Hyde suffered a sprained right shoulder and was sidelined the next two games. In Week 11 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, the team played well keeping the game close until the fourth quarter when the Patriots outscored the 49ers 17 to 7. Hyde finished the game with 19 carries for 86 yards. In Week 13 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, due to bad weather, both teams passing attack struggled and would rely on the run game, Hyde finished the game with 20 carries for 92 yards. The next week, Hyde rushed for 193 yards and one receiving touchdown in an overtime loss against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20York%20Jets%20season\"&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt;. Hyde started 13 games in 2016 finishing the season with 217 carries for 988 yards and six touchdowns along with 27 receptions for 163 yards and three touchdowns and was named an alternate for the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Hyde was placed on injured reserve on December 27, 2016 after suffering an MCL injury.\n2017 season.\nDuring the offseason, the 49ers new head coach &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Shanahan\"&gt;Kyle Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; and general manager &lt;a href=\"John%20Lynch%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;John Lynch&lt;/a&gt; brought in a lot of competition at the running back position. Hyde welcomed the challenge, saying \"that just pushes me to take my game to the next level, I want to be the starter.\" Hyde entered in the 2017 season having lost weight; he arrived to training camp in great shape weighing 228 pounds. In an interview Hyde was quoted saying \u201cThis is the lightest I\u2019ve been since high school, I\u2019m in the best shape of my life right now.\" Carlos Hyde's new body transformation led to results on the field, he showed off a quicker burst on rushing attempts than ever before. Hyde averaged five yards per carry in the season opener but after the first half, the team was playing from behind so to make a comeback the offense focused heavily on the pass abandoning the rushing attack. Hyde finished the game with nine rushing attempts for 45 yards against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt;. In Week 2, Hyde carried the offense against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;. He rushed for 102 yards on seven carries in the first half, most of his yardage came on the longest run of his career breaking a 61-yard run. Hyde finished the game with 15 carries for 124 yards, becoming the first running back to rush for 100 yards in back to back games on the road in Seattle since &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Carroll\"&gt;Pete Carroll&lt;/a&gt; became the head coach in 2010. Hyde's 124 rushing yards led all rushers for Week 2. In Weeks 3\u20138, Hyde had two games with two rushing touchdowns. In Week 9 against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, Hyde was involved in a fight with Frostee Rucker and Haasan Reddick, with all three combatants being ejected for throwing punches in a fighting pile. On November 9, Hyde was fined $9,115 for his role in the brawl. In the last four games of the regular season, he had at least one rushing touchdown in three of the four games, with the regular-season finale having him record 88 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.\nPlaying in all 16 games in 2017, Hyde finished the season with 940 rushing yards, a career-high 350 receiving yards, and a career-high eight rushing touchdowns.

Hyde made his Browns' debut in the season opener against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;.
