    "text": "Frank Klees (born March 6, 1951) is a former politician in &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He was a &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; from 1995 to 2014. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Harris\"&gt;Mike Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Eves\"&gt;Ernie Eves&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nKlees was born in &lt;a href=\"Landau\"&gt;Landau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;. His parents were &lt;a href=\"Danube%20Swabians\"&gt;Danube Swabians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; pioneers whose ancestors settled in parts of eastern Europe that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of five, Klees came with his family to Canada and settled in &lt;a href=\"Leamington%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Leamington, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. He worked as a businessman in the financial services sector with &lt;a href=\"Canada%20Life%20Financial\"&gt;Canada Life Assurance&lt;/a&gt;. He then became an entrepreneur, and started a sports agency which represented professional athletes. Klees also co-founded the Municipal Gas Corporation in 1990, and served as its executive vice-president until 1997.\nKlees sat on the board of the controversial &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Energy%20Corporation\"&gt;Universal Energy Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a natural gas and electricity retailer which has been fined by the &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Energy%20Board\"&gt;Ontario Energy Board&lt;/a&gt; on several occasions and frequently criticised by its own customers as being a scam. When Universal was bought out by &lt;a href=\"Just%20Energy\"&gt;Just Energy&lt;/a&gt; he was presented a seat on the board of their Exchange corporation.\nFrom 1992 to 1994, he was third vice-president and policy chair of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Klees lives in &lt;a href=\"Aurora%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Aurora, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlees is currently a registered lobbyist working on behalf of the development industry.\nPolitics.\nKlees ran for the Ontario legislature in the &lt;a href=\"1975%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;1975 provincial election&lt;/a&gt;, losing to Liberal &lt;a href=\"Remo%20Mancini\"&gt;Remo Mancini&lt;/a&gt; in the southwestern riding of &lt;a href=\"Essex%20South%20%28electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Essex South&lt;/a&gt;. He lost to Mancini a second time in the &lt;a href=\"1977%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;1977 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlees was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;election of 1995&lt;/a&gt;, defeating former &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; leadership candidate &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Beer\"&gt;Charles Beer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"York%20North%20%28Ontario%20provincial%20electoral%20district%29\"&gt;York\u2014Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt;. He was easily re-elected in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;1999 provincial election&lt;/a&gt; running in the new riding of &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Ridges%20%28electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Oak Ridges&lt;/a&gt;. On June 17, 1999 he was appointed to the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Harris\"&gt;Mike Harris&lt;/a&gt; as Chief Government Whip, Deputy House Leader and &lt;a href=\"Minister%20without%20Portfolio\"&gt;Minister without Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000, Klees was preparing to run as a candidate for the leadership of the new &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Alliance\"&gt;Canadian Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but withdrew because one of his key financial backers insisted on a last-minute deal to make a significant funding commitment conditional on Klees throwing his support to one of the other candidates on the second ballot.\nKlees stepped down from his ministerial position on July 30, 2001 for what he described as personal reasons. After returning to the &lt;a href=\"backbencher\"&gt;backbenches&lt;/a&gt; for a year, he was reappointed to cabinet on October 3, 2002 as &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Tourism%20and%20Culture%20%28Ontario%29\"&gt;Minister of Tourism&lt;/a&gt; under Harris' successor, &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Eves\"&gt;Ernie Eves&lt;/a&gt;. On February 25, 2003, he became &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Minister of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, and served in that position until the defeat of the Eves government in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;October 2003 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlees was re-elected in 2003, and was a candidate in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario%20leadership%20election\"&gt;2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election&lt;/a&gt; which took place on September 18, 2004. He was endorsed by Tory &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament%20%28Ontario%29\"&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Ouellette\"&gt;Jerry Ouellette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Chudleigh\"&gt;Ted Chudleigh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Murdoch\"&gt;Bill Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, and groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Youth%20Coalition\"&gt;Conservative Youth Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. The other candidates in the race were Whitby-Ajax MPP &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Flaherty\"&gt;Jim Flaherty&lt;/a&gt; and former Rogers Communications CEO &lt;a href=\"John%20Tory\"&gt;John Tory&lt;/a&gt;. Klees made healthcare his biggest priority in the campaign. He was the only candidate to openly endorse a semi-privatized &lt;a href=\"health%20care%20system\"&gt;health care system&lt;/a&gt;. Other key issues of his campaign were school choice, &lt;a href=\"physical%20education\"&gt;physical education&lt;/a&gt; in the school system, &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Health%20Insurance%20Plan\"&gt;OHIP&lt;/a&gt; statements, and foreign-trained doctors applying for employment. Klees was eliminated from the contest after placing third on the first ballot; Tory subsequently won on the second ballot. Klees increased his profile during the campaign, and became the Critic for Education and Citizenship &amp; Immigration in the Legislature as well as a member of the Justice Committee.\nKlees was elected in the newly created provincial riding of &lt;a href=\"Newmarket%E2%80%94Aurora%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29\"&gt;Newmarket-Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;2007 Ontario general election&lt;/a&gt;. He was re-elected in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 Ontario election&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlees contested the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario%20leadership%20election\"&gt;2009 leadership race&lt;/a&gt;, placing second behind the winner, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Hudak\"&gt;Tim Hudak&lt;/a&gt;. The single biggest campaign contribution of $32,000 was made by &lt;a href=\"OPTUS%20Capital%20Corporation\"&gt;OPTUS Capital Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Energy%20Corporation\"&gt;Universal Energy Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s founder and &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Silver\"&gt;Mark Silver&lt;/a&gt;. It accounted for 20% of the total contributions. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/andrew-steele/watching-the-detectives/article1163346/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Klees made a \"surprisingly impolitic concession speech\", and it was reported that he had a cool relationship with Hudak, in part because Klees supported Tory as party leader while Hudak refused.\nAfter the 2011 general election Klees requested the post of deputy party leader, presently held by Whitby-Oshawa MPP Christine Elliott, but Tim Hudak instead offered the shadow cabinet role of transportation critic along with ethnic outreach in the PC party's &lt;a href=\"shadow%20cabinet\"&gt;shadow cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, which Klees turned down. On October 25, 2011, Klees announced that he would run for &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, in defiance of the opposition party leaders who had earlier ordered their members not to contest the Speakership. The &lt;a href=\"minority%20government\"&gt;minority&lt;/a&gt; Liberal government was one seat short of forming a majority and if Klees had been elected Speaker, he would have given the government a &lt;a href=\"working%20majority\"&gt;working majority&lt;/a&gt; as the speaker usually votes with the government in &lt;a href=\"motion%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;motions of non-confidence&lt;/a&gt;. The move was met with derision from other Conservatives with one MPP saying, \"This is the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"crossing%20the%20floor\"&gt;crossing the floor&lt;/a&gt;... The Liberals better support him, because Frank doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends in our caucus today.\" Klees withdrew his candidacy on October 29, 2011 due to lack of support.\nHe did not run in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Ontario%20general%20election\"&gt;2014 election&lt;/a&gt;."
