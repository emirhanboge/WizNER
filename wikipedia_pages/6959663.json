In the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Spanish%20general%20election\"&gt;Spanish general election&lt;/a&gt; in March 2004, she was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Congress%20of%20Deputies\"&gt;Congress of Deputies&lt;/a&gt;, representing &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Congress%20of%20Deputies%20constituency%29\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;.

However, she was criticised by music industry officials for her statement that intellectual property is \"not an absolute right\". Her decision to transfer documents from the &lt;a href=\"General%20Archive%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;General Archive of the Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20community%20of%20Catalonia\"&gt;Autonomous community of Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; was controversial.\nBecause of the bad results of the previous year in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20cinema\"&gt;Spanish cinema&lt;/a&gt;, in 2007 Calvo presented a draft law that forces the movie theaters to shown European films (at least a 25%). This was rejected by most of the film industry and they went to strike on June 18, 2007, a strike followed by a 93% of the industry. Minister Calvo was replaced in July 2007 and her successor approved this law with big modifications in late 2007.\nShe was one of the ministers with worst approval ratings and was replaced in July 2007 by C\u00e9sar Antonio Molina.\nFirst Vice President of the Congress.\nAfter leaving the Ministry, Calvo was elected &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Deputies\"&gt;First Vice President of the Congress of Deputies&lt;/a&gt;, a position she held until the end of the congressional session.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Spanish%20general%20election\"&gt;2008 general election&lt;/a&gt;, Calvo was re-elected MP for C\u00f3rdoba and was appointed Chair of the Congress Committee on Equality, as well as becoming a member of the Congress Committee on Defence and Committee on Comprehensive Disability Policies. She also presided over two subcommittees, one on abortion and other about gender violence.\nCalvo did not run for re-election in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Spanish%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 general election&lt;/a&gt; due to her disagreement with the choice to put &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20Aguilar\"&gt;Rosa Aguilar&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the electoral list in &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Congress%20of%20Deputies%20constituency%29\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;. She returned to her post as professor of constitutional law in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;University of C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;. She later gained the confidence of Secretary-General of the Socialist Party &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Pedro S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt; and in 2017 he appointed her Secretary for Equality of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeputy Prime Minister.\nOn June 5, 2018, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Pedro S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt; would appoint Calvo as &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Presidency%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Minister of the Presidency, Relations with the Cortes and Equality&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time that the Ministry of the Presidency also took the equality portfolio. She was sworn in before the King at &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Zarzuela\"&gt;Palace of Zarzuela&lt;/a&gt; on 7 June 2018.\nDuring her term, Calvo focused on &lt;a href=\"gender-based%20violence\"&gt;gender-based violence&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"La%20Manada%20rape%20case\"&gt;La Manada rape case&lt;/a&gt;. In this so-called \"wolf pack\" case in which a group of men attacked an 18 year old woman, the Provincial Court of Navarre convicted the men of sexual abuse \u2014nine years in prison\u2014 and not for sexual assault or rape \u2014that would mean at least 20 years. The Court's decision provoked widespread social unrest. Calvo proposed a reform of the Criminal Code to include explicit &lt;a href=\"sexual%20consent\"&gt;sexual consent&lt;/a&gt;. After appealing the sentence, the High Court of Justice of Navarre confirmed the sentence of the provincial court.\nIn November 2018, Calvo also proposed to amend to the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; to exclude some words that can be considered offensive for disabled people and to create a constitutional mandate that especifically protects disabled women. In October 2019, she was an outspoken proponent of exhuming the remains of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Valle%20de%20los%20Ca%C3%ADdos\"&gt;Valle de los Ca\u00eddos&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 January 2020 she was sworn in again as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency in the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1nchez%20II%20Government\"&gt;S\u00e1nchez Second Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, losing the Ministry of Equality in favor of &lt;a href=\"Irene%20Montero\"&gt;Irene Montero&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2021, Calvo reaffirmed during an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Vanguardia\"&gt;La Vanguardia&lt;/a&gt;\" that the pardons of &lt;a href=\"Catalonian%20independence\"&gt;Catalonian independence&lt;/a&gt; politicians were near and asked the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt; not to \"confront Catalonia (because) the only alternative was normalizing relations and stop the tremendous confrontation provoked by independentism, the Spanish right and stabilize the situation\".\nPersonal life.\nCalvo is the sister of the politician and writer &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Calvo%20Poyato\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Calvo Poyato&lt;/a&gt;, former MP of the Parliament of Andalusia and former Mayor of Cabra.\nAt the age of 19, she married her childhood sweetheart, with whom she had a daughter at the age of 22. She and her daughter share a love for &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, she married &lt;a href=\"sociologist\"&gt;sociologist&lt;/a&gt; Manuel P\u00e9rez Yruela, former spokesperson of the &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Government%20of%20Andalusia\"&gt;Regional Government of Andalusia&lt;/a&gt; and researcher professor of the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Social%20Studies%20of%20Andalusia\"&gt;Institute of Social Studies of Andalusia&lt;/a&gt;.

She has two granddaughters.\nOn 25 March 2020, she tested positive for &lt;a href=\"Coronavirus%20disease%202019\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; during the first wave of &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain\"&gt;the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"P%C3%BAblico%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;P\u00fablico&lt;/a&gt;\" announced that Calvo had recovered from the illness in May 2020.\nShe is a fan of &lt;a href=\"Bullfighting%20in%20Spain\"&gt;bullfighting&lt;/a&gt;."
