    "text": "The politics of North Korea (officially the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic People's Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt; or DPRK) takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, \"&lt;a href=\"Juche\"&gt;Juche&lt;/a&gt;\", a concept created by &lt;a href=\"Hwang%20Jang-yop\"&gt;Hwang Jang-yop&lt;/a&gt; and later attributed to &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Juche\" theory is the belief that only through &lt;a href=\"Self-sustainability\"&gt;self-reliance&lt;/a&gt; and a strong independent state, can true socialism be achieved.\nNorth Korea's political system is built upon the principle of &lt;a href=\"centralization\"&gt;centralization&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"North%20Korean%20constitution\"&gt;North Korean constitution&lt;/a&gt; formally guarantees protection of &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20in%20North%20Korea\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;, in practice there are severe limits on &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20expression\"&gt;freedom of expression&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;the government&lt;/a&gt; closely &lt;a href=\"Mass%20surveillance%20in%20North%20Korea\"&gt;supervises&lt;/a&gt; the lives of North Korean citizens. The constitution defines North Korea as \"a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20dictatorship\"&gt;dictatorship of people's democracy&lt;/a&gt;\" under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Workers' Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (WPK), which is given &lt;a href=\"one-party%20state\"&gt;legal supremacy&lt;/a&gt; over other political parties. &lt;a href=\"General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK General Secretary&lt;/a&gt; is typically the &lt;a href=\"supreme%20leader\"&gt;supreme leader&lt;/a&gt;, who controls the &lt;a href=\"Presidium%20of%20the%20Politburo%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK Presidium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK Politburo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Secretariat%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK Secretariat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Military%20Commission%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;WPK Central Military Commission&lt;/a&gt;, making the officeholder the most powerful person in North Korea.\nThe WPK is the ruling party of North Korea. It has been in power since its creation in 1948. Other minor political parties also exist, but are legally bound to accept the ruling role of the WPK. They, with the WPK, comprise a &lt;a href=\"popular%20front\"&gt;popular front&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20for%20the%20Reunification%20of%20the%20Fatherland\"&gt;Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland&lt;/a&gt; (DFRF). Elections occur only in single-candidate races where the candidate is effectively selected beforehand by the WPK.\nIn addition to the parties, there are over 100 &lt;a href=\"mass%20organizations\"&gt;mass organizations&lt;/a&gt; controlled by the WPK. Those who are not WPK members are required to join one of these organizations. Of these, the most important ones are the &lt;a href=\"Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist%20Youth%20League\"&gt;Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Women%27s%20Union%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Socialist Women's Union of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions%20of%20Korea\"&gt;General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Agricultural%20Workers%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea&lt;/a&gt;. These four organizations are also DFRF members.\n&lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; ruled the country from 1948 until &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;his death&lt;/a&gt; in July 1994, holding the offices of &lt;a href=\"General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;General Secretary of the WPK&lt;/a&gt; from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1972), &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;Premier of North Korea&lt;/a&gt; from 1948 to 1972 and &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20leaders%20of%20North%20Korea%23Presidency_of_North_Korea_before_1994\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; from 1972 to 1994. He was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jong-il\"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;. While the younger Kim had been his father's designated successor since the 1980s, it took him three years to consolidate his power. He was named to his father's old post of General Secretary in 1997, and in 1998 became Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Defence%20Commission\"&gt;National Defence Commission&lt;/a&gt; (NDC), which gave him command of the armed forces. The constitution was amended to make the NDC chairmanship \"the highest post in the state.\" At the same time, the presidential post was written out of the constitution, and Kim Il-sung was designated \"&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20President%20of%20the%20Republic\"&gt;Eternal President of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to honor his memory forever. Most analysts believe the title to be a product of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung%27s%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;the cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; he cultivated during his life.\nOutside observers generally view North Korea as a &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dictatorship\"&gt;dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; particularly noting the elaborate &lt;a href=\"North%20Korean%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;cult of personality around Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20dynasty%20%28North%20Korea%29\"&gt;his family&lt;/a&gt;. The WPK, led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20for%20the%20Reunification%20of%20the%20Fatherland\"&gt;Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland&lt;/a&gt; of which all political officers are required to be members. The government has formally replaced all references to &lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism&lt;/a&gt; in its constitution with the locally developed concept of \"&lt;a href=\"Juche\"&gt;Juche&lt;/a&gt;\", or self-reliance. Kim Jong-il placed emphasis on the \"&lt;a href=\"Songun\"&gt;Songun&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"military-first\" philosophy, and all references to &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; were removed from the North Korean constitution in 2009. Under Kim Jong-un, terminology such as the &lt;a href=\"socialist%20economy\"&gt;socialist economy&lt;/a&gt; is again in common use.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;Constitution of North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the country is a democratic republic and the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20People%27s%20Assembly\"&gt;Supreme People's Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (SPA) and &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20People%27s%20Assemblies\"&gt;Provincial People's Assemblies&lt;/a&gt; (PPA) are elected by direct &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"secret%20ballot\"&gt;secret ballot&lt;/a&gt;. Suffrage is guaranteed to all citizens aged 17 and over. In reality, &lt;a href=\"Elections%20in%20North%20Korea\"&gt;these elections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Show%20election\"&gt;for show&lt;/a&gt; and feature single-candidate races only. Those who want to vote against the sole candidate on the ballot must go to a special booth\u2014in the presence of an electoral official\u2014to cross out the candidate's name before dropping it into the ballot box\u2014an act which, according to many &lt;a href=\"North%20Korean%20defectors\"&gt;North Korean defectors&lt;/a&gt;, is far too risky to even contemplate.\nAll elected candidates are members of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20for%20the%20Reunification%20of%20the%20Fatherland\"&gt;Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland&lt;/a&gt; (DFRF), a &lt;a href=\"popular%20front\"&gt;popular front&lt;/a&gt; dominated by the ruling &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Workers' Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (WPK). The two minor parties in the coalition are the &lt;a href=\"Chondoist%20Chongu%20Party\"&gt;Chondoist Chongu Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Korean Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, who also have a few elected officials. The WPK exercises direct control over the candidates selected for election by members of the other two parties. In the past, elections were contested by other minor parties as well, including the &lt;a href=\"Korea%20Buddhist%20Federation\"&gt;Korea Buddhist Federation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Independent%20Party\"&gt;Democratic Independent Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dongro%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Dongro People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gonmin%20People%27s%20Alliance\"&gt;Gonmin People's Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20Party\"&gt;People's Republic Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical ideology.\nOriginally a close ally of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, North Korea has increasingly emphasized \"&lt;a href=\"Juche\"&gt;Juche&lt;/a&gt;\", an adoption of &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Autarky\"&gt;self-reliance&lt;/a&gt;, which roots from &lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism&lt;/a&gt;, its adoption of a certain ideological form of Marxism\u2013Leninism is specific to the conditions of North Korea. \"Juche\" was enshrined as the official ideology when the country adopted a new constitution in 1972. In 2009, the constitution was amended again, quietly removing the brief references to &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; (). However, North Korea continues to see itself as part of a worldwide leftist movement. The Workers' Party maintains a relationship with other leftist parties, sending a delegation to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Meeting%20of%20Communist%20and%20Workers%27%20Parties\"&gt;International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties&lt;/a&gt;. North Korea has a strong &lt;a href=\"Cuba%E2%80%93North%20Korea%20relations\"&gt;relationship with Cuba&lt;/a&gt;; in 2016, the &lt;a href=\"North%20Korean%20government\"&gt;North Korean government&lt;/a&gt; declared three days of mourning after &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro%27s%20death\"&gt;Fidel Castro's death&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical developments.\nFor much of its history, North Korean politics have been dominated by its adversarial &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%E2%80%93South%20Korea%20relations\"&gt;relationship with South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, North Korea aligned with the Soviet Union and the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. The North Korean government invested heavily in &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;its military&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to develop the capability to &lt;a href=\"Korean%20reunification\"&gt;reunify Korea&lt;/a&gt; by force if possible and also preparing to repel any attack by &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Following the doctrine of \"Juche\", North Korea aimed for a high degree of economic independence and the mobilization of all the resources of the nation to defend Korean sovereignty against foreign powers.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;collapse of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s and the loss of Soviet aid, North Korea faced a long period of economic crisis, including severe agricultural and industrial shortages. North Korea's main political issue has been to find a way to sustain its economy without compromising the internal stability of its government or its ability to respond to perceived external threats. Recently, North Korean efforts to improve relations with South Korea to increase trade and to receive development assistance have been mildly successful. North Korea has tried to improve its relations with South Korea by &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%20at%20the%202018%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;participating in the Pyeongchang Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jong-un\"&gt;Kim Jong-un&lt;/a&gt; sent his band and a few officials to visit South Korea. But North Korea's determination to develop &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20weapon\"&gt;nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ballistic%20missile\"&gt;ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;s has prevented stable relations with both South Korea and the United States. North Korea has also experimented with &lt;a href=\"market%20economy\"&gt;market economics&lt;/a&gt; in some sectors of its economy, but these have had limited impact.\nAlthough there are occasional reports of signs of opposition to the government, these appear to be isolated, and there is no evidence of major internal threats to the current government. Some foreign analysts have pointed to widespread starvation, increased emigration through &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea-China%20border\"&gt;North Korea-China border&lt;/a&gt;, and new sources of information about the outside world for ordinary North Koreans as factors pointing to an imminent collapse of the regime. However, North Korea has remained stable in spite of more than a decade of such predictions. The Workers' Party of Korea maintains a monopoly on political power and Kim Jong-il remained the leader of the country until 2011, ever since he first gained power following the death of his father.\nAfter the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il reigned as the new leader, which marked the closure of one chapter of North Korean politics. Combined with external shocks and less charismatic personality of Kim Jong-il, the transition of the leadership caused North Korea toward less centralized control. There are three key institutions: the Korean People's Army (KPA), the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea (WPK), and the cabinet. Rather than dominate a unified system as his father had, each party has their own enduring goals, therefore providing checks and balances to the government. No one party could claim victory and power over the other ones. With changing internal situation, combined with external pressure, the cabinet started to endorse policies it had rejected for years. North Korea politics is gradually becoming more open and negotiable with foreign countries. The fact that the leader of North Korea is willing to talk with other leaders shows a huge step towards peace and negotiation.\nUnder Kim Jong-il the status of &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;the military&lt;/a&gt; was enhanced, and appeared to occupy the center of the North Korean political system; all the social sectors were forced to follow the military spirit and adopt military methods. Kim Jong-il's public activity focused heavily on \"&lt;a href=\"on-the-spot%20guidance\"&gt;on-the-spot guidance&lt;/a&gt;\" of places and events related to the military. The enhanced status of the military and military-centered political system was confirmed in 1998 at the first session of the &lt;a href=\"10th%20Supreme%20People%27s%20Assembly\"&gt;10th Supreme People's Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (SPA) by the promotion of NDC members into the official power hierarchy. All ten NDC members were ranked within the top twenty on 5 September, and all but one occupied the top twenty at the fiftieth anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Foundation%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28North%20Korea%29\"&gt;Day of the Foundation of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; on 9 September. Under Kim Jong-un there has been an increased emphasis on economic matters, with major defence spending needing support from an economic standpoint.\nWhile the commonly accepted view is that no dissent can be expressed in North Korea, the notionally academic economic journal \"Kyo\u2019ngje Yo\u2019ngu\" and the philosophical and economic journals of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung%20University\"&gt;Kim Il-sung University&lt;/a&gt; permit the presentation and discussion of the different views of various parts of the government.\nProtests.\nIn 2005, a &lt;a href=\"riot\"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt; began at &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung%20Stadium\"&gt;Kim Il-sung Stadium&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;World Cup qualification match&lt;/a&gt;, after a dispute between a Korean &lt;a href=\"Football%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and a Syrian &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Disqualification%20%28sports%29\"&gt;disqualification&lt;/a&gt; of the player.\nBetween 2006\u20132007, \"market riots\" erupted in the countryside when the government \"unsuccessfully tried to restart\" the Public Distribution System. &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Lankov\"&gt;Andrei Lankov&lt;/a&gt; goes on to say that the \"outbreak of public discontent usually happens at the markets when vendors believe that their right to make money is being unfairly infringed by some decision of the authorities\".\nIn June 2011, it was reported that the government had ordered universities to cancel most classes until April 2012, sending students to work on construction projects, presumably for fear of &lt;a href=\"Arab%20spring\"&gt;similar developments as in North Africa&lt;/a&gt;. In the previous months, the regime had ordered riot gear from China. However, \"as soon as universities were reopened, graffiti appeared again. Perhaps the succession is not the real reason, but greater awareness among North Koreans could lead to changes.\"\nTransition of power to Kim Jong-un.\nPolitical power.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20state%20funeral%20of%20Kim%20Jong-il\"&gt;death of Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt; on December 17, 2011, his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, inherited the political leadership of the DPRK. The succession of power was immediate: Kim Jong-un became &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Commander%20of%20the%20Korean%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army&lt;/a&gt; on December 30, 2011, was appointed First Secretary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea (WPK) on April 11, 2012, and was entitled First Chairman of the National Defense Commission (NDC) two days later. To gain complete political power, he became the military rank of &lt;a href=\"Wonsu\"&gt;Marshal of the KPA&lt;/a&gt;.\nDifferences from the Kim Jong-il regime.\nUp until his death, Kim Jong-il maintained a strong national &lt;a href=\"Songun\"&gt;military-first political system&lt;/a&gt; that equated stability with military power. Kim Jong-un continues to carry on the militarized political style of his father, but with less commitment to complete military rule. Since he took power, Kim Jong-un has attempted to move political power away from the KPA and has divided it among the WPK and the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. Because of his political lobbying, the WPK's &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; has vastly shifted power in April 2012: out of 17 members and 15 alternates of the Committee, only five members and six alternates derive from military and security sectors. Ever since, the economic power of the WPK, the cabinet, and the KPA has been in a tense balance. The KPA has lost a significant amount of economic influence because of the current regime, which continually shifts from what Kim Jong-il built his regime on, and may cause later internal issues.\nForeign relations.\nThe foreign relations of North Korea have been shaped by its conflict with &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and its historical ties with &lt;a href=\"world%20communism\"&gt;world communism&lt;/a&gt;. Both the government of North Korea and the government of &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; (officially the Republic of Korea) claim to be the sole legitimate government of the whole of &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s failed to resolve the issue, leaving North Korea locked in a military confrontation with South Korea and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Forces%20Korea\"&gt;United States Forces Korea&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone\"&gt;the Demilitarized Zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, North Korea only had diplomatic recognition by communist countries. Over the following decades, it established relations with developing countries and joined the &lt;a href=\"Non-Aligned%20Movement\"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt; collapsed in the years 1989\u20131992, North Korea made efforts to improve its diplomatic relations with developed capitalist countries. At the same time, there were international efforts to resolve the confrontation on the Korean peninsula (known as the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20conflict\"&gt;Korean conflict&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, North Korea &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%20and%20nuclear%20weapons\"&gt;acquired nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, adding to the concerns of the &lt;a href=\"international%20community\"&gt;international community&lt;/a&gt;."
