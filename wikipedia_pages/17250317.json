    "text": "Jeanne Gerville-R\u00e9ache (26 March 1882 \u2013 5 January 1915) was a French &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"contralto\"&gt;contralto&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Belle%20%C3%89poque\"&gt;Belle \u00c9poque&lt;/a&gt;. She possessed a remarkably beautiful voice, an excellent singing technique, and wide &lt;a href=\"vocal%20range\"&gt;vocal range&lt;/a&gt; which enabled her to perform several roles traditionally associated with &lt;a href=\"mezzo-soprano\"&gt;mezzo-soprano&lt;/a&gt;s in addition to contralto parts. Her career began successfully in Europe just before the turn of the twentieth century. She later came to the North America in 1907 where she worked as an immensely popular singer until her sudden death in 1915. She is particularly remembered for her portrayal of Dalila in Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"&lt;a href=\"Samson%20and%20Delilah%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Samson et Dalila&lt;/a&gt;\", which she helped establish as an important part of the repertory within the United States. She also notably portrayed the role of Genevi\u00e8ve in the world premiere of Debussy's \"&lt;a href=\"Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1902.\nBiography.\nJeanne Gerville-R\u00e9ache was born in &lt;a href=\"Orthez\"&gt;Orthez&lt;/a&gt;, France. Her father was the governor of the French Caribbean islands &lt;a href=\"Guadeloupe\"&gt;Guadeloupe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt;, and she spent her childhood in Martinique with him and her Spanish mother. She studied in Paris under &lt;a href=\"Rosine%20Laborde\"&gt;Rosine Laborde&lt;/a&gt; through whom she met operatic &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Calv%C3%A9\"&gt;Emma Calv\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, a former pupil of Laborde's. Calv\u00e9 arranged for Gerville-R\u00e9ache to make her professional opera d\u00e9but as Orph\u00e9e in Gluck's \"&lt;a href=\"Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice\"&gt;Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra-Comique\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra-Comique&lt;/a&gt; in 1899. Mezzo-soprano &lt;a href=\"Pauline%20Viardot\"&gt;Pauline Garc\u00eda-Viardot&lt;/a&gt; coached her for this first production and then continued to teach her for the next several years.\nGerville-R\u00e9ache was offered a permanent place at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1900 and she sang there through 1902. While there she sang roles in two world premieres, Catherine in &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Erlanger\"&gt;Camille Erlanger&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Juif%20polonais\"&gt;Le Juif polonais&lt;/a&gt;\" (1900) and the role of Genevi\u00e8ve in Debussy's \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" in 1902. Shortly after \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", Gerville-R\u00e9ache got in a heated argument with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique 's director, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Carr%C3%A9\"&gt;Albert Carr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, and she left the company. In 1903 she joined the roster at the &lt;a href=\"La%20Monnaie\"&gt;Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels where she appeared in five operas over the next two seasons. She made her debut at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, London, in 1905 in the role of Orpheus.\nIn 1907, Gerville-R\u00e9ache came to the United States for the first time to sing with the &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;Manhattan Opera Company&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, where she performed roles until 1910. She notably reprised the role of Genevi\u00e8ve in the United States premiere of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (1908) and gave a critically acclaimed performance as Dalila in Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"Samson et Dalila\". She also sang in the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Blockx\"&gt;Jan Blockx&lt;/a&gt;'s \"De Herbergprinses\" (performed in Italian as \"La Princesse d'Auberge\", 1909), and in the United States premiere of Richard Strauss's \"&lt;a href=\"Elektra%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Elektra&lt;/a&gt;\" (1910) as Klytaemnestra, the latter of which she did not enjoy singing. In 1910 she married Georges Gibier Rambaud who was the director of the &lt;a href=\"Pasteur%20Institute\"&gt;Pasteur Institute&lt;/a&gt;'s branch in New York City.\nFrom 1910 until 1912, Gerville-R\u00e9ache sang with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Grand%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;Chicago Grand Opera Company&lt;/a&gt; and appeared in operas in Boston and Philadelphia. She portrayed such roles as Dalila, the title role in Bizet's \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\", Brang\u00e4ne in Richard Wagner's \"&lt;a href=\"Tristan%20und%20Isolde\"&gt;Tristan und Isolde&lt;/a&gt;\", and Fricka in Wagner's \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Walk%C3%BCre\"&gt;Die Walk\u00fcre&lt;/a&gt;\". From 1914 until 1915 she sang with the National Canadian Opera in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.\nGerville-R\u00e9ache died at the early age of 32 from &lt;a href=\"ptomaine%20poisoning\"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. Up to this point, everything had indicated a spectacular continuation of her brilliant career and the music community lamented the loss of what several critics had deemed \"one of the most beautiful voices of the century\". Her voice is preserved on several recordings made with &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Talking%20Machine%20Company\"&gt;Victor Talking Machine Company&lt;/a&gt; between 1908 and 1913. She left behind her husband and two sons. She has a great-great grandson and granddaughter living in America."
