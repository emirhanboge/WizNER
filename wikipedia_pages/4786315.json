    "text": "Rampla Juniors F\u00fatbol Club, commonly known as Rampla Juniors, is a Uruguayan &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Montevideo\"&gt;Montevideo&lt;/a&gt;. The team was actively playing the 2021 season by January 2021. In their home stadium, Rampla won the Uruguayan championship in 1927. In 2019, the Rampla Juniors F\u00fatbol Club had &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Ol%C3%ADmpico%20%28Montevideo%29\"&gt;Estadio Ol\u00edmpico&lt;/a&gt;, with 6,000 capacity, as its home stadium. Fans are nicknamed \"The Flinstones,\" as they helped build the team's home stadium in the 1960s, which resembled a quarry.\nHistory.\nOrigin and colours.\nRampla Juniors were founded in the &lt;a href=\"Aduana\"&gt;Aduana&lt;/a&gt; area (also the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"River%20Plate%20FC\"&gt;River Plate FC&lt;/a&gt;), then moved first to the &lt;a href=\"Aguada%2C%20Montevideo\"&gt;Aguada&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, and finally, around 1920, to the Cerro neighborhood. Their colors are taken from Fortaleza, a club that existed in the early years of Rampla's stint in the Cerro area. Another story of how they chose their colors is similar to how Boca Juniors supposedly got the idea for their kit colors from a &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20flag\"&gt;Swedish flag&lt;/a&gt; on a ship. It is rumored that Rampla's founders took the red and green from an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20flag\"&gt;Italian flag&lt;/a&gt; on a ship that arrived in &lt;a href=\"Montevideo%20Bay\"&gt;Montevideo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. It is also said that the basketball team CA Aguada (founded in 1922) took their colors from Rampla Juniors.\nEarly championships and games.\nIn their home stadium, Rampla won the Uruguayan championship in 1927. Rampla in 1927 won the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Uruguaya\"&gt;Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, the 1927 Squad was: &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Arispe\"&gt;Pedro Arispe&lt;/a&gt; (Captain), Pedro Aguirre, Enrique Ballestrero, Pedro Cabrera, Julio Nieto, Jos\u00e9 Magallanes, Juan Miguel Ferm\u00edn \"Ruso\" Labraga, Luis Gait\u00e1n, Conrado Haeberli, Vital Ruffatti and Conrado Bidegain.\nRampla was once called the third \"big\" (meaning popular or best) of Uruguay's clubs, &lt;a href=\"Pe%C3%B1arol\"&gt;Pe\u00f1arol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Nacional%20de%20Football\"&gt;Nacional&lt;/a&gt; being first and second, due to the huge number of followers and positive results. \nIn its early days, Rampla Juniors had strong ties with the meat packing industries that forged the neighborhood that it represents, notably the &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; companies &lt;a href=\"Swift%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armour%20and%20Company\"&gt;Armour&lt;/a&gt;. From those companies' workforces came several important players to Rampla Juniors. Until the mid 1960s Ramplas' supporters were known as Friyis, as the sound resembled fridges (from the meat packing industries). \nFans are nicknamed \"The Flinstones,\" as they helped build the team's home stadium during the 1964 and 1966 construction, which resembled a quarry. In 1966, the stadium had received its name. \nIn the 1980s the club replaced the stadium's old wooden stands with new ones made with concrete. Supporters helped break stones for the restoration, hence their new nickname, the Picapiedras (stone breakers).\nIn 2007, Rampla finished tied in 2nd place with &lt;a href=\"Danubio%20F.C.\"&gt;Danubio&lt;/a&gt; in the Uruguayan 1st division. Their team record was (9 wins, 4 draws, and 2 losses, in 15 games).\nRecent seasons.\nBy 2009, the club was in political and financial difficulties. By 2015, Rampla was in debt around US $200,000. In 2016, trade unionist &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Castillo%20%28Uruguayan%20politician%29\"&gt;Juan Castillo&lt;/a&gt; was named the club's president, and new management was announced too. Castillo was soon replaced with Isabel Pe\u00f1a as president. In 2020, the club's debts were paid by businessman &lt;a href=\"Edgard%20Parnas\"&gt;Edgard Parnas&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for 20% of the club's ownership.\nIn 2019, the Rampla Juniors F\u00fatbol Club continued to use &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Ol%C3%ADmpico%20%28Montevideo%29\"&gt;Estadio Ol\u00edmpico&lt;/a&gt;, with 6,000 capacity, as its home stadium. To play a promotion tournament, in August 2020, the team raised US$180,000 in six days, refinancing 50% of debt with players, and paying the other half to start in the Second Division (&lt;a href=\"Uruguayan%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Uruguayan Segunda Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;). By 2020 December, Rampla Juniors beat &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Club%20de%20Montevideo\"&gt;Racing Club de Montevideo&lt;/a&gt; 3-0, and were in the final for promotion in the second division.\nThe team was actively playing the 2021 season by January 2021.
