    "text": "Tunica Municipal Airport is a public use &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; located one\u00a0&lt;a href=\"nautical%20mile\"&gt;nautical mile&lt;/a&gt; (2\u00a0&lt;a href=\"kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;) east of the &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tunica%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Tunica&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Tunica%20County%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Tunica County, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It is owned by the Tunica County Airport Commission. Also known as Tunica Airport, it should not be confused with the 10 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; privately owned, public use &lt;a href=\"Tunica%20Airport\"&gt;Tunica Airport&lt;/a&gt; located south of the center of town, which has been recently changed to Ralph M Sharpe Airport.\nAs per &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; records, the airport had 59,795 passenger boardings (enplanements) in &lt;a href=\"calendar%20year\"&gt;calendar year&lt;/a&gt; 2008, 64,238 enplanements in 2009, and 65,907 in 2010. It has not had scheduled commercial airline passenger service since 2011. This airport is included in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2011\u20132015, which &lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;categorized&lt;/a&gt; it as a \"&lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;\" facility.\nAlthough most U.S. airports use the same three-letter &lt;a href=\"location%20identifier\"&gt;location identifier&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"International%20Air%20Transport%20Association\"&gt;IATA&lt;/a&gt;, Tunica Municipal Airport is assigned UTA by the FAA and UTM by the IATA (which assigned UTA to &lt;a href=\"Mutare%20Airport\"&gt;Mutare Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mutare\"&gt;Mutare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nDevelopment and improvement of the facility, located in the southern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Memphis%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Memphis Metropolitan Area&lt;/a&gt;, has increased dramatically since the 1990s. Tunica Municipal is considered as one of the multiple beneficiaries of sales tax revenue generated by the addition of &lt;a href=\"casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt;s to the county, following approval by the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Legislature\"&gt;Mississippi Legislature&lt;/a&gt; to introduce gaming houses. The growth of the &lt;a href=\"Tunica%20Resorts%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Tunica Resorts&lt;/a&gt; region into the third largest gaming destination behind &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Atlantic City, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, aided efforts to expand air service beyond charter flights.\nThe airport opened in 2003 with a 5,500-foot runway. A $5.6 million project in 2004 extended the runway length to 7,000 feet, long enough to accommodate larger aircraft.\nIn 2005, Tunica received its Part 139 certification to allow large jets from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;. The first large jet, a 125-passenger &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737\"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; operated by Gold Transportation for Harrah's Entertainment, landed in Tunica in November 2005. Prior to this flight, the largest flight that had landed in Tunica had 30 passengers. In May 2006, &lt;a href=\"Boston-Maine%20Airways\"&gt;Boston-Maine Airways&lt;/a&gt; operating as Pan Am Clipper Connection, began Tunica's first scheduled service with three &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20727\"&gt;Boeing 727&lt;/a&gt; flights per week from &lt;a href=\"Hartsfield-Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. That service ended in 2006 when the airline lost its routes from Atlanta.\nCasino charters continue to fly into Tunica growing passenger traffic despite the loss of the Clipper Connection service. In 2007, the airport had nearly 50,000 charter passengers. The charter traffic continued to grow with the announcement that &lt;a href=\"Allegiant%20Airlines\"&gt;Allegiant Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, would base under a contract with &lt;a href=\"Harrah%27s%20Entertainment\"&gt;Harrah's Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, to base two Allegiant aircraft at Tunica to ferry customers to Tunica, &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa\"&gt;Council Bluffs, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, total passenger traffic to Tunica was more than 70,000 people.\nTunica completed a $40 million project to extend the runway to 8,500 feet, extend the taxiway and build a new hangar. The airport is working on a new terminal building which is expected to be completed in 2010. The passenger terminal will replace the temporary terminal building which has been in operation since the airport opened.\n&lt;a href=\"AirTran%20Airways\"&gt;AirTran Airways&lt;/a&gt; began nonstop flights from Tunica to &lt;a href=\"Hartsfield-Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on May 6, 2010 with &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20717\"&gt;Boeing 717&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. It was the airport's first regular commercial service since 2006. However, AirTran ended service on May 2, 2011. Vision Airlines launched service to Destin/Fort Walton on June 1, 2011 but dropped the route a few months later leaving the airport with no commercial scheduled service. Republic Airlines opened charter service a few years later from &lt;a href=\"Youngstown%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Youngstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, a route now operated by &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Airways\"&gt;Elite Airways&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nTunica Municipal Airport covers an area of 863 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (349 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 194 feet (59 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. It has one &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt; designated 17/35 with an &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; surface measuring 8,500 by 150 feet (2,591 x 46 m).\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 10,257 aircraft operations, an average of 28 per day: 89% &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, 9% &lt;a href=\"airline\"&gt;scheduled commercial&lt;/a&gt;, 2% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;1% &lt;a href=\"military%20aviation\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. At that time there were 10 aircraft based at this airport: 70% single-&lt;a href=\"aircraft%20engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt;, 20% multi-engine, and 10% &lt;a href=\"jet%20aircraft\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt;."
