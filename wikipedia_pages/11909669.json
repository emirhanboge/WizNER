    "text": "Kara (also Lemusmus or Lemakot) is an &lt;a href=\"Austronesian%20languages\"&gt;Austronesian language&lt;/a&gt; spoken by about 5,000 people in 1998 in the &lt;a href=\"Kavieng%20District\"&gt;Kavieng District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20Ireland%20Province\"&gt;New Ireland Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Laxudumau%20language\"&gt;Laxudumau&lt;/a&gt;, spoken in the village of Lakudumau, is transitional to &lt;a href=\"Nalik%20language\"&gt;Nalik&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nKara contains fourteen &lt;a href=\"consonant\"&gt;consonant&lt;/a&gt;s. Single consonants are found within the &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; of a word, &lt;a href=\"Intervocalic%20consonant\"&gt;intervocalically&lt;/a&gt; between two vowels, &lt;a href=\"Final%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;finally&lt;/a&gt; and in sequences of less than two words &lt;a href=\"Syllable%20medial\"&gt;medial&lt;/a&gt;ly. Voiceless consonants /p, t, q, \u0278, s/ create a cluster on the second consonant. Voiced consonants /b, d, g, \u03b2, \u0263/ appear initially and intervocally. They appear as the second consonant of a cluster. An example would be [\u03b2al\u03b2al] 'tree sap'. It is notable that different dialects change the use of consonants. \"West Kara\" replaces /s/ with /z/ anytime it would proceed a vowel, and interpolate /\u0278/ with [h] before a vowel and [\u0294] at the end of a word.\nVowels.\nKara contains ten &lt;a href=\"vowel\"&gt;vowel&lt;/a&gt;s. Relative to their position in the &lt;a href=\"Vowel%20diagram\"&gt;IPA vowel chart&lt;/a&gt;, the vowels in Kara tend to contrast each other throughout the language. Central vowels [a] and [\u0259] contrast in both open and closed syllables. Example:\nMid vowels [e] and [\u025b],and [o]and [\u0254] are complementary to each other in its respective pairs. Each pair occurs in &lt;a href=\"open%20syllable\"&gt;open syllable&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"syllable\"&gt;syllable&lt;/a&gt; consisting of an \"onset\" and \"nucleus\" but no \"coda\".\nHigher vowels [i] and [\u026a], and [u] and [\u028a] contrast in &lt;a href=\"closed%20syllables\"&gt;closed syllables&lt;/a&gt;, a syllable consisting of an \"onset\", \"nucleus\", and \"coda\".\nStress.\nKara has an unusual occurrence of &lt;a href=\"Stress%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, or relative emphasis of syllables. Stress in Kara occurs on any syllable in a word, but follows a system of rules that allow placement of stress in an ordered system in all words that contain two syllables or more. However, syllables stemmed from prefixes are never stressed regardless of the ordered system. Stress is determined by three factors: vowel quality, syllable closure, and position in the word, with vowel quality being the most important factor.\nSyllables and Stress.\nA syllable with a nucleus of /a/ receives primary stress regardless of its position in the word.\nA word with more than one syllable and a nucleus of /a/ has the stress fall on the last syllable..\nA word with neither a syllable with a nucleus of /a/ or a closed syllable has the stress fall on the initial syllable.\nGrammar.\nKara follows a &lt;a href=\"Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object\"&gt;verb-subject-object&lt;/a&gt; word order, and uses reduplication for creation of more complex sentences. The language determines that body parts and kinship terms must be identified as belonging to someone which make it possible for inalienable possession.\nVerbs.\n&lt;a href=\"Verb\"&gt;Verb&lt;/a&gt;s in Kara are used &lt;a href=\"Transitivity%20%28grammar%29\"&gt;transitively&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the verbs in Kara span a spectrum that ultimately determines how speaking the language occurs between an object and that verb. Transitivity of verbs is used to also determine whether or not the spoken language is between two people actively who are actively speakers, rather than a speaker and a listener. For example: The verb [kuus] 'say' has an initiator but no one to actively speak to.\nReduplication.\n&lt;a href=\"Reduplication\"&gt;Reduplication&lt;/a&gt; occurs when words with an initial consonant is plosive. The reduplicated consonant created is said fricatively within the same articulation of the word.\nInalienable Possession.\nNote that most of the second person forms do not contain [\u0259], this occurs because sequences such as /i\u0258, u\u0258, o\u0258, e\u0259/ only occur before /\u0264/ or /q/. Since it /\u0258/ is the second vowel in a sequence, /\u0259/ is either combined or deleted before any consonant besides /\u0264/ and /q/."
