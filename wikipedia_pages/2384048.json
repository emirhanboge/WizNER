    "text": "The second &lt;a href=\"general%20election\"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Council\"&gt;Highland Council&lt;/a&gt; was held in May 2003, using 80 &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28politics%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s created for the first election, in 1999. In 1999 and 2003 each ward elected one &lt;a href=\"councillor\"&gt;councillor&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"first%20past%20the%20post\"&gt;first past the post&lt;/a&gt; system of &lt;a href=\"election\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;. Elections are held on a four-year cycle: therefore the next general election is scheduled for 2007.\nWards are grouped into areas. Councillors elected from a particular area become members of the relevant &lt;a href=\"area%20committee\"&gt;area committee&lt;/a&gt;. The areas are similar to the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20and%20districts%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt; which were abolished in 1996, when the Highland region became a &lt;a href=\"Council%20areas%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;unitary council area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are plans to use new larger wards for the next general election, each electing three or four councillors by the &lt;a href=\"single%20transferable%20vote\"&gt;single transferable vote&lt;/a&gt; system. The total number of councillors will remain the same. The single transferable vote system, with multi-member wards, is designed to produce a form of &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical representation.\nThe 2003 election created a council of 55 &lt;a href=\"independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"councillor\"&gt;councillor&lt;/a&gt;s, 12 &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; councillors and 6 &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20National%20Party\"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; councillors.\nNow, after two &lt;a href=\"by-elections\"&gt;by-elections&lt;/a&gt;, there are 54 independent councillors, 12 Liberal Democrat councillors, 8 Labour Party councillors and 6 Scottish National Party councillors.\nBy-elections.\nThere have been two &lt;a href=\"by-elections\"&gt;by-elections&lt;/a&gt; since the 2003 election.\nBeauly and Strathglass.\nIn June 2004, a by-election was held to fill a vacancy in the Beauly and Strathglass ward, in the &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; area. The vacancy was due to the resignation of an independent councillor. The by-election had no effect on the balance of political representation.\nLochardil.\nIn August 2006, a by-election was held to fill a vacancy in the Lochardil ward, in the &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; area. The vacancy was due to the death of a councillor. The ward returned a Liberal Democrat to the council, so taking number of the seats held by that party up from 11 to 12.\nBadenoch and Strathspey wards.\nThere are five wards in the &lt;a href=\"Badenoch%20and%20Strathspey\"&gt;Badenoch and Strathspey&lt;/a&gt; area:\n\u2020 Area Convener (or \"Area Chairman\")\nCaithness wards.\nThere are 10 wards in the &lt;a href=\"Caithness\"&gt;Caithness&lt;/a&gt; area:\n\u2020 Area Convener\nInverness wards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; area includes &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Ness\"&gt;Loch Ness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strathglass\"&gt;Strathglass&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Inverness\"&gt;City of Inverness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; lacks clearly defined boundaries. In ward descriptions below \"the city\" means the urban area centred on the former &lt;a href=\"burgh\"&gt;burgh&lt;/a&gt; of Inverness.\nThere are 23 wards in the area:\n\u2020 Area Convener (or \"Provost and Area Convener\")\nLochaber wards.\nThere are eight wards in the &lt;a href=\"Lochaber\"&gt;Lochaber&lt;/a&gt; area:\n\u2020 Area Convener\nNairn wards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nairn\"&gt;Nairn&lt;/a&gt; area is mostly rural. Ward boundaries radiate from the town of Nairn (a former &lt;a href=\"burgh\"&gt;burgh&lt;/a&gt;), dividing the town between all four wards:\n\u2020 Area Convener (or \"Area Chairman\")\nRoss and Cromarty wards.\nThere are 18 wards in the &lt;a href=\"Ross%20and%20Cromarty\"&gt;Ross and Cromarty&lt;/a&gt; area:\n\u2020 Area Convener\nSkye and Lochalsh wards.\nThere are six wards in the &lt;a href=\"Skye%20and%20Lochalsh\"&gt;Skye and Lochalsh&lt;/a&gt; area:\n\u2020 Area Convener (or \"Area Ceannaire\")\nSutherland wards.\nThere are six wards in the &lt;a href=\"Sutherland\"&gt;Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; area:"
