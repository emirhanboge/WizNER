    "text": "RNAS Burscough, also known as HMS \"Ringtail\", was a &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Air%20Arm\"&gt;Fleet Air Arm&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) &lt;a href=\"naval%20air%20station\"&gt;naval air station&lt;/a&gt; which was situated 1.5 statute miles south-west of &lt;a href=\"Burscough\"&gt;Burscough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"British%20Admiralty\"&gt;Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; acquired of land in December 1942 and the airfield was built with four narrow &lt;a href=\"runways\"&gt;runways&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;s, being commissioned on 1 September 1943.\nIt was used to train for landing aircraft on &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s. Specifically, \"according to Aldon P. Ferguson's book \"Lancashire Airfields in the Second World War\": 'it was constructed to the normal Navy plan with four runways instead of three, all of which were only 30 yards wide instead of the RAF standard 50 yards. The extra runway allowed the aircraft to land and take off as close as possible into the wind, with eight directions to choose from. The narrower landing strips also simulated take off and landing on aircraft carriers.'\"\nThe name HMS \"Ringtail\" was as for a ship because it was a Navy airfield, rather than a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; one, and it was named was for a bird. (Note: \"Ring-tail\" is an informal term used by birders for juveniles of several &lt;a href=\"harrier%20%28bird%29\"&gt;harrier&lt;/a&gt; species when seen in the field and not identifiable to an exact species.)\nWartime operational history.\nThe air station was planned to accommodate FAA day, night and &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20aircraft\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadrons&lt;/a&gt; for their formation, training and working-up. Many FAA squadrons were based at Burscough for a period of a few weeks or months, before moving to front-line FAA bases or on to &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s for deployment in action in the European or Far Eastern war fronts.\nOne of the first FAA units to operate from HMS \"Ringtail\" was &lt;a href=\"809%20Squadron%20FAA\"&gt;809 Squadron FAA&lt;/a&gt;, equipped with &lt;a href=\"Supermarine%20Seafire\"&gt;Supermarine Seafire&lt;/a&gt;s, it arrived from &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Andover\"&gt;RAF Andover&lt;/a&gt; on 19 December 1943, then departed on 29 December when it flew its aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier .\nPostwar naval operations.\nRNAS Burscough closed for flying in May 1946. Thereafter, the hangars were used for the storage of aircraft engines and other FAA equipment, under the direction of &lt;a href=\"RNAS%20Stretton%20%28HMS%20Blackcap%29\"&gt;RNAS Stretton (a.k.a. HMS \"Blackcap\")&lt;/a&gt;, until both airfields were disposed of in 1957.\nCivil aviation Activities.\nDuring the 1960s, civil &lt;a href=\"cropduster\"&gt;cropduster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"agricultural%20aircraft\"&gt;agricultural aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, both fixed wing and &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s, used the now otherwise inactive airfield as an operating base for refuelling and filling the aircraft's spray tanks.\nNon-aviation usage.\nAs of early 2009, four naval &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;s still survive in use for non-aviation purposes, and were used by the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mttrust.co.uk\"&gt;Merseyside Transport Trust&lt;/a&gt;, from the late 1970s until January 2012, when the charity moved to new premises within the industrial estate. The four hangars now stand empty and unused. These four hangars include 'Pentad' type hangars, and are located on the western edge of the old airfield.\nThe site is now being developed with a large &lt;a href=\"supermarket\"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt; having opened; there are several historic photographs and maps on display in their cafe of the wartime site."
