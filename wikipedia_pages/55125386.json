    "text": "Adrian Delia, (born 8 August 1969, in &lt;a href=\"Sliema\"&gt;Sliema&lt;/a&gt;, Malta) is a &lt;a href=\"Maltese%20people\"&gt;Maltese&lt;/a&gt; politician, and lawyer by profession. He is the former leader of the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Party%20%28Malta%29\"&gt;Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt; from September 2017 till October 2020.\nEarly life.\nAdrian Delia grew up in &lt;a href=\"Birkirkara\"&gt;Birkirkara&lt;/a&gt;. He received his formation from the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"St%20Aloysius%27%20College%20%28Malta%29\"&gt;St Aloysius' College&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated as a lawyer from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Malta\"&gt;University of Malta&lt;/a&gt; in 1993.\nProfessional life.\nDelia started out in the Legal Office of Mid-Med Bank, a bank later acquired by &lt;a href=\"HSBC\"&gt;HSBC&lt;/a&gt; and branded as HSBC Malta. Delia founded his legal firm Aequitas Legal. He acted as Director and Company Secretary of &lt;a href=\"Erste%20Bank\"&gt;Erste Bank Malta&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvolvement in football.\nDelia was elected as vice-president of &lt;a href=\"Birkirkara%20F.C.\"&gt;Birkirkara F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in June 2011, while also representing the club in the council of the &lt;a href=\"Malta%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Malta Football Association&lt;/a&gt;. He then was president of Birkirkara from 29 May 2015 till 29 June 2017 following his announcement that he would be taking an active role in politics.\nUnder the presidency of Delia the club achieved the first qualification in the third qualifying round in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt; in Season &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;. Delia famously lured in former &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italian international&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fabrizio%20Miccoli\"&gt;Fabrizio Miccoli&lt;/a&gt;. The team won a match against &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, but were eliminated on penalties. After the match West Ham showed interest in Birkirkara's &lt;a href=\"Mauricio%20Mazzetti\"&gt;Mauricio Mazzetti&lt;/a&gt;, but Delia commented that no formal offers had been made.\nInvolvement in politics.\nAdrian Delia worked for &lt;a href=\"Radio%20101%20%28Malta%29\"&gt;Radio 101&lt;/a&gt; during his student years.\nHe was approached by &lt;a href=\"Mario%20de%20Marco\"&gt;Mario de Marco&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Party%20%28Malta%29\"&gt;Nationalist Party (Malta)&lt;/a&gt; to contest the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Maltese%20general%20election\"&gt;2013 Maltese general election&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2017%20Maltese%20general%20election\"&gt;2017 Maltese general election&lt;/a&gt;, which he both declined for career reasons.\nIn 2017, after the &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Busuttil\"&gt;Simon Busuttil&lt;/a&gt;'s announced departure as Leader of the Nationalist Party further to the loss in the 2017 elections, Delia was the first to contest the leadership of the party. He resigned from Birkirkara F.C. on 28 June 2017. His nomination was made official on 17 July 2017. Delia faced &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Said\"&gt;Chris Said&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Portelli%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Frank Portelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Perici%20Calascione\"&gt;Alex Perici Calascione&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2018, it was reported that Adrian Delia was possibly the most popular throughout the race, as his lack of political experience was seen as an advantage. On 17 September 2017 he was confirmed as Leader of the Nationalist Party.\nLeader of the Nationalist Party.\nDuring the beginning of his tenure, Delia started reworking the image of the Nationalist Party. In fact the team installed was no longer made up by a majority of lawyers, which was typical of the party, but instead included a sociologist, an economist, a banker and an engineer. He also reintroduced the party to the man in the street, by visiting villages and their local clubs.\nHe took a &lt;a href=\"socially%20conservative\"&gt;socially conservative&lt;/a&gt; stance in politics in general, flagging Malta as lacking traditional moral values and national soul, and has come out against the relaxation of drug laws and liberalisation of prostitution. Delia also raised security concerns from lack of community policing where necessary. He also came out against vacation leave for homosexual women seeking IVF treatment abroad, a parliamentary motion which proved unpopular and was lost.\nOn 16 October 2017, further to the death of &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Caruana%20Galizia\"&gt;Daphne Caruana Galizia&lt;/a&gt;, he expressed concerns over rule of law, calling the incident \"the collapse of democracy and freedom of expression.\" He called for &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Muscat\"&gt;Joseph Muscat&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Prime Minister of Malta&lt;/a&gt;, to assume responsibility of what happened by resigning. Delia however declined to join protests, saying it would not be appropriate for him to be present, given their past feud.\nOn 3 February 2018, as Opposition Leader, Delia reshuffled spokespersons within the Parliamentary Group and took the shadowing of the Justice Ministry in hand.\nOn 20 May 2018, Delia promised that a PN government, if elected, would repay the money overcharged from energy bills.\nFurther to the conclusions of the magisterial inquiry with regards to ownership of Egrant, Delia requested that the report would be published in full, and wrote to the Advocate General to provide him with a full copy. Furthermore, Delia removed &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Busuttil\"&gt;Simon Busuttil&lt;/a&gt; from Shadow Minister for Good Governance and asked him to resign on 22 July 2018. Delia assumed the Good Governance portfolio himself. His request was later backed by the Administrative Council of the Party.\nControversy.\nIn 2017, &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Caruana%20Galizia\"&gt;Daphne Caruana Galizia&lt;/a&gt; accused Delia of links to a London-based prostitution racket. Delia denied the allegation. In a later interview, in May 2018, he promised to resign if any such activity is ever found.\nDuring the same period, in September 2017, Delia was also linked to &lt;a href=\"freemasonry\"&gt;freemasonry&lt;/a&gt;, a link he denied.\nIn September 2018, several of Malta's &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Non-governmental%20organization\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;s called out Delia for his comments about &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20to%20Malta\"&gt;foreigners&lt;/a&gt; causing a threat to Maltese identity and values, calling them \"abhorrent\". The NGOs were also \"shocked and disgusted\", saying that by \"using inflammatory language and calling for affirmation of the Maltese identity\" he had \"accused non-Maltese nationals of instilling feelings of fear and insecurity\".\nIn late December 2018, Delia has been accused of &lt;a href=\"domestic%20violence\"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;, calling for him to step down from the leadership of the PN. A &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rights\"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt; campaigner, Francesca Fenech Conti, has also urged Delia to resign after the domestic violence allegations. &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Malta%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%20Farrugia\"&gt;Godfrey Farrugia&lt;/a&gt; and former PN general secretary Rosette Thake also urged Delia to resign.\nIncome Tax.\nJanuary 2018, Dr Delia had reached an agreement with the Inland Revenue Department to start settling dues dating back more than a decade.\nThe first bill, which covered the period between 2007 and 2013, totalled \u20ac81,751. It consisted of \u20ac48,374 in unpaid tax, a \u20ac4,604 penalty and \u20ac28,773 in interest.\nFor the period 2014 to 2017 the pending bill of income tax was \u20ac64,086.\nDr Delias In-Laws paid the PN leader around \u20ac55,000 on 23 March 2018 and \u20ac65,000 on 20 April 2018 to settle his tax bill."
