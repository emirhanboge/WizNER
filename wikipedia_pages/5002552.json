    "text": "Impurity is a &lt;a href=\"studio%20album\"&gt;studio album&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army%20%28band%29\"&gt;New Model Army&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1990.\nIt was the first album without &lt;a href=\"Bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;ist &lt;a href=\"Moose%20Harris\"&gt;Jason Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who had been replaced by Peter Nice (better known as \"Nelson\"). It was the band's last studio album with &lt;a href=\"EMI\"&gt;EMI&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe album sees the band venturing further into the musical territory which they began exploring on their previous album, \"&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20and%20Consolation\"&gt;Thunder and Consolation&lt;/a&gt;\" (1989). &lt;a href=\"Violin\"&gt;Violin&lt;/a&gt;ist Ed Alleyne-Johnson was again a collaborator. It also contained the guitar work of Adrian Portas.\nThe album reached #23 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK albums chart&lt;/a&gt; in October 1990.\nCritical reception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Trouser%20Press\"&gt;Trouser Press&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that the album \"exemplifies a fervent, trend- bucking band that has remained true to its original goals.\"\nSingles.\nThe singles released from the album were \"Get Me Out\" (September 1990), \"Purity\" (October 1990) and \"Space\" (June 1991).\nVersions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"LP%20album\"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt; contained 11 tracks, the &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Disc\"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; version included the bonus track \"Marrakesh\".\nThe German gatefold-version of the LP had a slightly different cover-artwork. The band logo is printed in light-grey instead of the other version's red logo.\nThe album was &lt;a href=\"remaster\"&gt;remaster&lt;/a&gt;ed and &lt;a href=\"reissue\"&gt;reissue&lt;/a&gt;d in 2005 with a bonus disc containing rarities, &lt;a href=\"A-side%20and%20B-side\"&gt;B-sides&lt;/a&gt; and live tracks."
