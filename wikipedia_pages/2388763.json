    "text": "The Singapore Cup is an annual &lt;a href=\"single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;knockout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in Singapore.\nThe Singapore Cup is the major cup competition in Singapore football, and has existed since 1998. It was renamed from the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Singapore%20League%20Cup\"&gt;1997 Singapore League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which bears no relation to the current &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20League%20Cup\"&gt;competition of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Komoco Motors became the title sponsors of the 2019 Singapore Cup. \nIt is open to clubs in the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Singapore Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2005, foreign teams from other countries in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; have been invited to compete in the Singapore Cup. &lt;a href=\"Chonburi%20F.C.\"&gt;Chonburi Province FC&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; was the first foreign club reaching the final in 2006 (they lost 3\u20132 in the final to &lt;a href=\"Tampines%20Rovers%20FC\"&gt;Tampines Rovers&lt;/a&gt;). In 2009, &lt;a href=\"Bangkok%20Glass%20F.C.\"&gt;Bangkok Glass&lt;/a&gt; became the second foreign team to reach the final, losing it against &lt;a href=\"Geylang%20International%20FC\"&gt;Geylang United&lt;/a&gt;, but they beat Tampines Rovers in 2010 to become the first foreign winners of the Singapore Cup."
