Some of the notable alumni of its Residential Academies are Ranjan Soren &amp; Lionel Rymee.\nAdmission to these residential academies are done through a series of scouting programmes conducted throughout the country by the BBFS Technical and Management personnel. In December 2019 BBFS also initiated the 'Prince of Football' project in association with the Sports and Youth Affairs (S&amp;YA) Department, Government of Sikkim.

(formerly Garhwal Heroes F.C.) is an Indian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club formed in 1953 in New Delhi.

In Garhwal's 67 year old heritage, it has been the first time that the club has participated in the National League with 9 of its players promoted from BBFS\u2019 youth development programme.\nSocial responsibility.\nBhaichung Bhutia's vision that \"no talented Indian kid should be deprived of good coaching facilities for want of money or other resources\" led to the establishment of the Indian Football Foundation (IFF) which is a sister organization to BBFS. It is one of the first not-for-profit organizations in India that is specifically focused on supporting talented young footballers from economically weaker sections to develop into professional footballers in an organized manner. Funds are raised to aid underprivileged young footballers with a 100 percent scholarship to provide them with quality coaching through BBFS. The IFF through its strategic tie ups with the NGOs &amp; Government bodies focuses on talent identification through its scouting program and talent nurturing via the IFF - BBFS Scholarship Program."
