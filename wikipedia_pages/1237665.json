His entertainment career began at the age of 13, when he appeared in a major musical production at the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Grand%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Manila Grand Opera House&lt;/a&gt;. In the next several years, he was a fixture in the Manila &lt;a href=\"bodabil\"&gt;bodabil&lt;/a&gt; circuit, popular for his skill in dancing the &lt;a href=\"boogie-woogie\"&gt;boogie-woogie&lt;/a&gt;.\nChiquito was befriended by &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Poe%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Fernando Poe, Sr.&lt;/a&gt;, and with Poe's assistance, started a film career. He broke into films with \"Sanggano\" from Palaris Pictures. He would star in over a hundred films, mostly comedies, over the next five decades. He established his own production company, Sotang Bastos Productions, named after his favorite film role from the 1950s. He would ride on the crest of ever popular comedy spoofs of &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; genres such as the &lt;a href=\"crime%20film\"&gt;gangster film&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn one of these Western spoofs, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Arizona%20Kid%20%281971%20film%29\"&gt;The Arizona Kid&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971), he co-starred with Hollywood &lt;a href=\"sex%20symbol\"&gt;sex symbol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mamie%20Van%20Doren\"&gt;Mamie Van Doren&lt;/a&gt;.
