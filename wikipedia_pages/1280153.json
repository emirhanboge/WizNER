He is a vegan activist, chef, and wellness entrepreneur.\nEarly life and college career.\nSalley was born in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Salley played high school ball at &lt;a href=\"Canarsie%20High%20School\"&gt;Canarsie High School&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn. He is a 1988 graduate of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20College%20of%20Management\"&gt;College of Management&lt;/a&gt;. He helped the Yellow Jackets win the 1985 ACC Championship, they also advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He left in 1986 as Tech\u2019s all-time leader in blocked shots. Salley holds Georgia Tech's personal fouls record, and has had his jersey number 22 retired\u2014a very rare honor in college basketball.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Pistons.\nSalley was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Pistons\"&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"1986%20NBA%20draft\"&gt;1986 NBA draft&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;. After joining the Pistons, he became close friends with &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Dantley\"&gt;Adrian Dantley&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him proper nutrition, how to exercise, and how to conduct himself off the court. Salley, for his part, called Dantley \"The Teacher\". Salley would become good friends with comedian &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Murphy\"&gt;Eddie Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and made several appearances at comedy clubs in the off-season. In 1989 and 1990, he played on two Pistons NBA championship teams. He is among the Pistons' all-time leaders in blocked shots.\nUnder the coaching of &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Daly\"&gt;Chuck Daly&lt;/a&gt;, Salley was part of the Pistons era that featured three consecutive NBA finals appearances. The team's defense-oriented style of play earned them the nickname of the NBA's \"Bad Boys\", with Salley playing alongside &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Rodman\"&gt;Dennis Rodman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Laimbeer\"&gt;Bill Laimbeer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Edwards%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;James Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Dumars\"&gt;Joe Dumars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Thomas\"&gt;Isiah Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Mahorn\"&gt;Rick Mahorn&lt;/a&gt; and Dantley. After losing the &lt;a href=\"1988%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1988 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; in seven games to the Lakers, the Pistons turned it around to sweep the Lakers in four games in &lt;a href=\"1989%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;. Salley and the Pistons repeated in &lt;a href=\"1990%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Trail%20Blazers\"&gt;Portland Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; in five games. The Pistons' run came to an end when the &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jordan\"&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bulls\"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt; swept them in four games in the &lt;a href=\"1991%20NBA%20Playoffs%23Eastern%20Conference\"&gt;1991 Eastern Conference finals&lt;/a&gt;; following game four, while most of the Pistons players chose to return to the locker room rather than congratulate the new Eastern Conference champions, Salley was one of the few who stayed on the court as the game ended to congratulate the Bulls.\nMiami Heat, Toronto Raptors.\nSalley was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Heat\"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. In the &lt;a href=\"1995%20NBA%20expansion%20draft\"&gt;1995 NBA expansion draft&lt;/a&gt; he was selected by the inaugural Toronto Raptors team after being made available by the Heat.\nIn February 1996, he negotiated a buyout of his contract and was waived thus ending his &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Toronto%20Raptors%20season\"&gt;stint with the Raptors&lt;/a&gt; during which he averaged 19.3 minutes and 6 points per game.\nChicago Bulls.\nFree of his Raptors contract, in early March 1996, Salley signed a 10-day contract with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bulls\"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt;, where he played with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jordan\"&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scottie%20Pippen\"&gt;Scottie Pippen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Kuko%C4%8D\"&gt;Toni Kuko\u010d&lt;/a&gt;, and former Pistons teammates &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Rodman\"&gt;Dennis Rodman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Edwards%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;James Edwards&lt;/a&gt;. Following another 10-day contract right after the first one ended, the Bulls signed Salley as a free agent and he spent the rest of the season with the team. The &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season\"&gt;1995-96 Bulls&lt;/a&gt; achieved a record-breaking 72-win season, the best-ever regular-season record at the time, later surpassed by the &lt;a href=\"2015-16%20Golden%20State%20Warriors%20season\"&gt;2015-16 Golden State Warriors&lt;/a&gt; at 73-9. Salley would win his 3rd NBA championship in June, playing sparingly in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1996 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne month with Panathinaikos.\nIn September 1996, thirty-two-year-old Salley came out of what turned out to be only a three-month retirement and went to play in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, where he joined the &lt;a href=\"1996%20FIBA%20European%20League%20Final%20Four\"&gt;reigning EuroLeague champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20BC\"&gt;Panathinaikos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Basket%20League\"&gt;Greek Basket League&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year US$1 million contract. Before accepting the &lt;a href=\"Bo%C5%BEidar%20Maljkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;-coached Panathinaikos' offer, Salley had reportedly consulted with recent Bulls teammate &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Kuko%C4%8D\"&gt;Toni Kuko\u010d&lt;/a&gt; who knew Maljkovi\u0107 well having spent four trophy-laden seasons anchoring his late 1980s &lt;a href=\"KK%20Split\"&gt;KK Split&lt;/a&gt; teams.\nSalley made his Panathinaikos debut on September 25, 1996, in &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20FIBA%20EuroLeague\"&gt;EuroLeague&lt;/a&gt; away at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona%20B%C3%A0squet\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, a 77-58 loss during which he scored 5 points before fouling out in only 12 minutes of action. Right away, Salley got on the bad side of coach Maljkovi\u0107 who refused to modify his disciplinarian approach in order to accommodate a veteran player with a notable NBA career behind him. Though Salley's performances somewhat improved over the following three EuroLeague outings \u2014 10 points in a home loss versus &lt;a href=\"ASVEL%20Basket\"&gt;ASVEL&lt;/a&gt;, 9 points and 11 rebounds in a blowout home win versus &lt;a href=\"KK%20Split\"&gt;KK Split&lt;/a&gt;, and 21 points and 8 rebounds in a win away at minnows &lt;a href=\"Bayer%20Giants%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as he seemingly adjusted to European referees and managed to stay out of foul trouble, he continued to butt heads with coach Maljkovi\u0107. After flying back to Athens with the team the morning after the Leverkusen game, Salley refused to go to practice and as a result, got dropped by Maljkovi\u0107 for their Greek League game the following day. He then flew back to the United States for meetings with TV executives over a new talk show he had been planning to host for Disney, returning to Athens an hour before the club's &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Basketball%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Cup&lt;/a&gt; game versus &lt;a href=\"P.A.O.K.%20BC\"&gt;P.A.O.K.&lt;/a&gt; on October 22, 1996 \u2014 a trip that included Salley renting a private &lt;a href=\"Learjet\"&gt;Lear jet&lt;/a&gt; in Paris for US$20,000 out of his own pocket in order to make it back to Athens in time for the game after having his connecting flight delayed and then even renting a &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; once he landed at Athens' &lt;a href=\"Ellinikon%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Ellinikon Airport&lt;/a&gt; to take him right to Panathinaikos' &lt;a href=\"O.A.C.A.%20Olympic%20Indoor%20Hall\"&gt;OACA Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the city's &lt;a href=\"Marousi\"&gt;Marousi&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood. However, Maljkovi\u0107 still refused to include him in the lineup and in response, Salley decided to leave Panathinaikos unilaterally two days later on October 24, 1996, after only a month at the club.\nSalley appeared in seven games for Panathinaikos and ended up getting paid about \u20ac300,000.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nIn 1999, Salley joined a Lakers team led by superstars &lt;a href=\"Shaquille%20O%27Neal\"&gt;Shaquille O'Neal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kobe%20Bryant\"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt; and also reunited with his former Bulls coach, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Jackson\"&gt;Phil Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. He saw little action for the Lakers en route to their first of three consecutive NBA championships. In 2000, he retired again following the first Lakers championship season after proudly proclaiming that he had won \"four championship rings, with three different teams, in three different decades and two different millenniums\". 14 years later, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Duncan\"&gt;Tim Duncan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Spurs\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt; became the second player to achieve this (sans the requirement of different teams) by leading his Spurs to five championships between &lt;a href=\"1998-99%20NBA%20season\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013-14%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-basketball career.\nFilm.\nIn 1995, John Salley had a role in \"&lt;a href=\"Bad%20Boys%20%281995%20film%29\"&gt;Bad Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" as a thick-glassed computer hacking nerd who gets out of jail because he helps crack files for the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Miami Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.
