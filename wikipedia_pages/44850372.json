    "text": "Barn Football Club is a former Irish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Carrickfergus\"&gt;Carrickfergus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim\"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1889 by workers in the James Taylor &amp; Co. cotton mill, known as the Barn Mills, in Carrickfergus. The club entered the Irish Junior Cup for the first time in 1890\u201391 and the &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim%20Shield\"&gt;County Antrim Shield&lt;/a&gt; in 1891\u201392, in which they reached the semi-final. In 1923, Barn was elected to an expanded &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Irish Football League&lt;/a&gt;, but retained membership only for five seasons. Financial difficulties meant that the team played the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20League%201927%E2%80%9328\"&gt;1927\u201328 season&lt;/a&gt; with a squad made up entirely of amateurs, finishing second bottom, and folding at the season's end The club's ground was the &lt;a href=\"Taylors%20Avenue\"&gt;Barn Field&lt;/a&gt;, later known as Taylors Avenue.\n&lt;a href=\"Barn%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Barn United&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1954, took their name from Barn and continue to play in the same area."
