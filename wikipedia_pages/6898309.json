In 1992 she recorded a solo album, \"Eat Life\", that was not released before 2009. She also appeared on Kingsbery's 1997 release \"Pretty Ballerina\", with a re-recording of the Cock Robin track, \"More Than Willing\". She moved from Los Angeles to the California desert, where she also has been performing as part of &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Sol\"&gt;Ra Sol&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, she contributed a reading of her poem \"A Song for Lost Blossoms\" to the album of the same name by &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Budd\"&gt;Harold Budd&lt;/a&gt; and former Cock Robin member Clive Wright.\nIn 2013, she recorded a duet with French vocalist Tristan D\u00e9camps on his album \"Le Bruit des Humains\"."
