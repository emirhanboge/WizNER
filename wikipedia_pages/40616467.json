The standard &lt;a href=\"VAT\"&gt;VAT&lt;/a&gt; rate is 20% and the lower rate is 10%. Income from &lt;a href=\"dividends\"&gt;dividends&lt;/a&gt; is a subject to a 15% tax. Serbia has &lt;a href=\"tax%20treaties\"&gt;tax treaties&lt;/a&gt; with most countries in, but few outside, Europe.\nThe standard personal tax rate is 10%. If the individual earns more than 3 times average salary, an additional tax rate of 10% is applied. For a person earning six times the average salary, an additional 15% is applied on top of the previously described taxes. It must be clear that all the tax rates described are cumulatively applied, one on top of the other.\nObligatory contributions for state funds by an employee (up to a certain amount) include:\nObligatory contributions for state funds by an employer (also capped) include:\nThe effective personal income tax rate is therefore somewhere in the range 20\u201341%. &lt;a href=\"Capital%20gains\"&gt;Capital gains&lt;/a&gt; are not subject to personal income tax."
