    "text": "Sardanapalo or Sardanapale (&lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Sardanapalus\"&gt;Sardanapalus&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Franz%20Liszt\"&gt;S.687&lt;/a&gt;, is an unfinished &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Liszt\"&gt;Franz Liszt&lt;/a&gt; based on the 1821 verse play \"&lt;a href=\"Sardanapalus%20%28play%29\"&gt;Sardanapalus&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Byron\"&gt;Lord Byron&lt;/a&gt;. Liszt was ambitious for his project, and planned to dovetail his retirement as a virtuoso with the premiere of his opera. He worked on it intermittently between 1845 and 1852, once declaring it 'well on the way toward completion,' but ceased work on it thereafter. The first act had been completed in a detailed, continuous particell, but there is no evidence of any music being notated for Acts 2\u20133. As an Italian opera, it would almost certainly have been called \"Sardanapalo\", though Liszt referred to it as \"Sardanapale\" in his French correspondence. The music Liszt completed remained silent until 2016 when British musicologist David Trippett first established the legibility of Liszt's N4 manuscript, and produced both a critical edition and realized an orchestral performing edition (after Liszt's own instrumental cues for orchestration). This received its world premiere in Weimar on August 19, 2018.\nBackground.\nLiszt first mentions his desire to compose a large-scale opera in October 1841. Alongside his interest in the genre's capacity for realizing literary narratives in music, he was motivated, in part, by the prospect of being recognised as more than a travelling keyboard virtuoso; with Rossini's stature in mind, a major opera offered Liszt a way of entering 'the musical guild'. (His early one-act opera, \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Sanche\"&gt;Don Sanche&lt;/a&gt;\", composed aged 13, closed after four performances at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, and could hardly qualify to raise his status.) Among the range of opera subjects he considered, he initially settled on an opera based on Byron's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Corsair\"&gt;The Corsair&lt;/a&gt;\", and even obtained in 1844 a libretto by &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Dumas\"&gt;Alexandre Dumas&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing came of this.\nTowards the end of 1845 he settled on the subject of Byron's tragedy \"Sardanapalus\" (1821). At this time Liszt had been appointed at the &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Frederick%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\"&gt;court in Weimar&lt;/a&gt;, but had not yet taken up residence. He briefly considered a possible opportunity at the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20am%20K%C3%A4rntnertor\"&gt;Hoftheater, Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Kapellmeister\"&gt;Kapellmeister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaetano%20Donizetti\"&gt;Gaetano Donizetti&lt;/a&gt;, was seriously ill (he would die in 1848). A large-scale Italian opera could have placed him in the running for Donizetti's influential post, as he wrote in an 1846 letter to the &lt;a href=\"Marie%20d%27Agoult\"&gt;Comtesse d'Agoult&lt;/a&gt;. Yet he told her only a few months later that, given the conduct of the people involved, \"that post will do me no good\" and was no longer a consideration.\nIn correspondence with his close associate &lt;a href=\"Cristina%20Trivulzio%20Belgiojoso\"&gt;the Princess Belgiojoso&lt;/a&gt;, Liszt first planned to have the opera performed in &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; in 1846\u201347, later switching the venue to the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20am%20K%C3%A4rntnertor\"&gt;K\u00e4rntnertor Theater&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna (1847), and finally to \"Paris or London\" (1852).\nSardanapalus was, according to the writer &lt;a href=\"Ctesias\"&gt;Ctesias&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of &lt;a href=\"Assyria\"&gt;Assyria&lt;/a&gt;. Some have identified him with &lt;a href=\"Assurbanipal\"&gt;Assurbanipal&lt;/a&gt;, but the Sardanapalus of Ctesias, \"an effeminate debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided capture by suicide\" is not an identifiable historical character. Ctesias's tale (the original is lost) was preserved by &lt;a href=\"Diodorus%20Siculus\"&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/a&gt;, and it is on this account that Byron based his play.\nLiszt had been present at the second performance in 1830 of the oratorio \"The Death of Sardanapalus\" by &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Berlioz\"&gt;Hector Berlioz&lt;/a&gt;, which featured an immolation scene, in preparation for which a \"sacrifice of the innocents\" took place, as famously depicted in &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix&lt;/a&gt;'s sensational 1828 painting of the subject (\"illustration\"). These influences may have stoked Liszt's interest in the tale's potential for operatic treatment. With reference to the inferno that ends Byron's play, he tells Belgiojoso that \"his\" finale will \"aim to set the entire audience alight\". By 1849, when he at last began to write the music, he conceived the idea of further altering the libretto by adding an orgy scene, perhaps after Delacroix, but this was turned down by Belgiojoso.\nFinding a libretto.\nLiszt's librettist of choice, &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9licien%20Mallefille\"&gt;F\u00e9licien Mallefille&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to the commission and received a down-payment, but missed several deadlines and - when prompted - requested additional funds. Growing frustrated at the delay, Liszt decided to end the agreement and move on. (Mallefille did finally submit an initial prose scenario, but it was too late for Liszt to consider continuing his planned collaboration with the Frenchman.) &lt;a href=\"Cristina%20Trivulzio%20Belgiojoso\"&gt;Belgiojoso&lt;/a&gt; then procured an unnamed Italian poet ('my nightingale'), as the new librettist; this poet was currently under house arrest for agitating towards Italian independence. In December 1846, Liszt sent his assistant, Gaetano Belloni, to Paris with orders 'to bring me back, dead or alive, a poem [libretto] in his pocket'; he managed to deliver the first act of a libretto, in Italian, on New Year's Day 1847. The remainder followed 18 months later, though Liszt wrote to Belgiojoso querying aspects of the text for Acts 2\u20133. She replied with further suggestions, and it is unclear whether the correspondence continued. Liszt delayed for a time, perhaps waiting for the revisions to Acts 2 and 3, but began composing the first act around 11 April 1850.\nBetween April 1850 and December 1851 Liszt notated 110 pages of music (now in the Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv in Weimar, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ores.klassik-stiftung.de/ords/f%3Fp%3D401%3A1%3A17125900983301%3A%3A%3A%3A%3A\"&gt;digitised&lt;/a&gt; in 2019) and wrote to &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt; that the opera would be ready for production in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 1852. Liszt's assistant, &lt;a href=\"Joachim%20Raff\"&gt;Joachim Raff&lt;/a&gt;, notes in December 1851 that he would soon be asked to produce a provisional orchestration of the opera for Liszt, but this never took place. Shortly thereafter Liszt seems to have abandoned his work on the opera. It is possible that his diffidence resulted from reading Wagner's essay \"&lt;a href=\"Opera%20and%20Drama\"&gt;Opera and Drama&lt;/a&gt;\", by whose criteria an Italian opera could have appeared somewhat outmoded (even as Liszt's ambition was expressly to modernise the genre, the better to translate a literary source into 'musical drama'). But Trippett has argued this was unlikely to have been a decisive factor, and suggested instead that Liszt's abandonment resulted from his concern over the libretto, and the fact that he never received a revised libretto for Acts 2 and 3, so could not set these to music.\nSynopsis.\nScene 1.\nThe royal palace at &lt;a href=\"Nineveh\"&gt;Nineveh&lt;/a&gt;. Evening.\nA festival is underway. The women of the harem invite revellers to dance, with erotic intent. They surround Mirra, telling her to forget her troubles and revive her spirits through love (\u2018the light and air speak of love / Come, rejoice in the shared joy\u2019). Mirra is sad, nostalgic for her home in Greece and tearfully broken hearted (\u2018Have no further thought for me! Leave!\u2019). The women, undeterred, encourage her to enjoy her position as the King's favourite and embrace a life of \u2018boundless ecstasy\u2019 enraptured by \u2018angelic kisses\u2019.\nScene 2.\nMirra, unpersuaded, begs to be left alone, and the chorus departs. Now by herself, she daydreams of the lost happiness of her life in Ionia, prompted by the memory of her mother's smile. Awakening from the dream, she remonstrates at being torn in two directions (\u2018a slave, alone, plaything of fate\u2019): she loves the King deeply, yet is ridden with guilt, for it was he who conquered and destroyed her homeland. While a majority of his subjects don't respect him (owing to his effeminate, non-brutal ways), she closes the scene with a virtuosic cabaletta that celebrates the sincerity of her love for him (\u2018my heart was blessed with indescribable contentment\u2019).\nScene 3.\nThe King enters, and\u2014seeing Mirra's tears\u2014seeks to comfort her. She says she has not the strength to tell him her woes and he should not ask her, but he implores her (\u2018Speak! Speak! At hearing your voice I tremble with joy and hope\u2019). At his repeated insistence, she explains only that theirs is an \u2018ill-fated flame that brings nothing but shame and grief\u2019. At this the king chides her, leading to the exchange: Sard: \u2018Do you love me?\u2019 Mirra: \u2018Would that I could not!\u2019 The scene now turns, developing into a triumphant love duet. And the king, unaware of Mirra's complex motives, declares the strength and purity of their love (\u2018let us love as long as the fervid age smiles upon us\u2019), even as she notes only the lack of dignity her adulterous role carries.\nScene 4.\nAt the height of the lovers' passion, Beleso\u2014an elder statesman\u2014arrives suddenly, warning of war. He chides the king for not taking his role seriously, for forgetting his people's needs, and ignoring the \u2018inner voice of duty\u2019. A band of rebel Satraps are readying forces against the empire, and Beleso invokes the ancient kings of Assyria in disgust (\u2018witness the error of your successor, forgetting the sceptre for a base slave mistress\u2019) before urging the king to fight: \u2018set aside the &lt;a href=\"distaff\"&gt;distaff&lt;/a&gt;, grasp the sword!\u2019 Sardanapalo hesitates, fearing that violence leads only to the suffering of innocents (\u2018every glory is a lie, if it must be bought with the weeping of afflicted humankind\u2019).\n In a lyric aside, Mirra wonders aloud why he is hesitating, and seeks to reawaken his noble valour through her sensuous appeal. Finally, he is persuaded, and agrees to resist the rebels with force. A closing trio sees the king growing more contented as military ruler, Mirra praising his new noble demeanour, and Beleso beating the drums of war as the army mobiles and begins to march into battle.\nFirst edition.\nInitial comments on Liszt's manuscript had declared it 'a series of sketches' (1911). But in 2016, musicologist David Trippett discovered that the music and libretto are both decipherable and continuous, constituting the first act of Liszt's planned three-act opera. Two separate editions of Liszt's manuscript were published in 2019: a critical edition for the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.kotta.info/en/product/20017A/LISZT-FERENC-Sardanapalo-Act-1-Fragment\"&gt;Neue Liszt Ausgabe&lt;/a&gt;, and an orchestrated performing edition (Schott) that draws critically on all Liszt's indications and cues for orchestration. No music or libretto text is known to exist for Acts 2\u20133. The &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ores.klassik-stiftung.de/ords/f%3Fp%3D401%3A2%3A%3A%3A%3A%3AP2_ID%3A198863\"&gt;manuscript N4&lt;/a&gt; was digitised and made available online by Klassik Stiftung Weimar in 2019.\nInstrumentation.\nThe performing edition of \"Sardanapalo\" is scored for 1 piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 1 cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, 1 bass trombone, 1 tuba, percussion, 2 harps, strings.\nFirst recording and press reception.\n\"Sardanapalo\" (2019). &lt;a href=\"Joyce%20El-Khoury\"&gt;Joyce El-Khoury&lt;/a&gt; (Mirra), Airam Hern\u00e1ndez (King Sardanapalo), Oleksandr Pushniak (Beleso) &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Staatskapelle\"&gt;Weimar Staatskapelle&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Kirill%20Karabits\"&gt;Kirill Karabits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.audite.de/en/product/CD/97764-mazeppa_sardanapalo.html\"&gt;Audite CD 97764&lt;/a&gt;. This recording was released on 8 February 2019 and arose from the world premiere performance in Weimar, 19\u201320 August 2018. Upon its release the recording received international &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.sardanapalo.org/press\"&gt;critical acclaim&lt;/a&gt;, and became the best-selling classical CD (across all platforms) in the UK Official Charts.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" declared it \"A torridly exciting recording \u2026 It is not too big a statement to say that the work\u2019s emergence changes music history. ... You wonder what heights were left to breach in the unwritten acts. \u2026 A most special and historic release\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Gramophone%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Gramophone&lt;/a&gt;\" awarded it 'Editor's Choice' declaring it: \"immensely important \u2026 the act is beautifully shaped, while Liszt\u2019s fluid treatment of bel canto structures reveals an assured musical dramatist at work. Trippett has carefully modelled his orchestration on Liszt\u2019s works on the 1850s, and it sounds unquestionably authentic. A fine work by one of the most inventive of composers.\"\nFor \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" it was \"a lost opera of glittering scope,\" &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunday%20Times\"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt; (Album of the week) spoke of \"rip-roaring stuff, characteristic of the dramatic orchestral narratives of the composer\u2019s neglected tone poems,\" and &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Now\"&gt;Opera Now&lt;/a&gt; (Critics Choice) declared it \"lush and Romantic to a fault, with long-spun melodies, an innate sense of dramatic thrust and some thrilling choral work. ... Liszt does forge his own voice.\"\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", responding to a fragment released in 2017, spoke of Liszt's 'white-hot aria ... The music is a great tide of chromatic lushness'. \n\"&lt;a href=\"Bachtrack\"&gt;Bachtrack&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote of \"an entirely convincing drama, packed with incident and bursting with thrilling vocal and orchestral colour \u2013 think Bellini reimagined by Wagner and you have some idea of the vast emotional sweep of this gripping music.\"\nIn December 2019 it was listed in \"The Guardian\" 's Top 10 Classical CDs of 2019, in \"&lt;a href=\"Gramophone%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Gramophone&lt;/a&gt;'s Recordings of the Year, and was awarded 'Recording of the Year' in the category 'Premiere Recording (rediscovery / reconstruction)' by Presto Classical."
