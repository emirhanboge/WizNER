    "text": "Sir Edwin Chadwick &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Bath\"&gt;KCB&lt;/a&gt; (24 January 18006 July 1890) was an English social reformer who is noted for his leadership in reforming the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law\"&gt;Poor Law&lt;/a&gt;s in England and instituting major reforms in urban &lt;a href=\"sanitation\"&gt;sanitation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"public%20health\"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;. A disciple of &lt;a href=\"Utilitarianism\"&gt;Utilitarian&lt;/a&gt; philosopher &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Bentham\"&gt;Jeremy Bentham&lt;/a&gt;, he was most active between 1832 and 1854; after that he held minor positions, and his views were largely ignored. Chadwick pioneered the use of scientific surveys to identify all phases of a complex social problem, and pioneered the use of systematic long-term inspection programmes to make sure the reforms operated as planned.\nEarly life.\nEdwin Chadwick was born on 24 January 1800 at &lt;a href=\"Longsight\"&gt;Longsight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. His mother died when he was still a young child, yet to be named. His father, James Chadwick, tutored the scientist &lt;a href=\"John%20Dalton\"&gt;John Dalton&lt;/a&gt; in music and botany and was considered to be an advanced liberal politician, thus exposing young Edwin to political and social ideas. His grandfather, Andrew Chadwick, had been a close friend of the Methodist theologian &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley\"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe began his education at a small school in &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; and moved to a boarding school in &lt;a href=\"Stockport\"&gt;Stockport&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied until he was 10. When his family moved to London in 1810, Chadwick continued his education with the help of private tutors, his father and a great deal of self-teaching.\nHis father remarried in the early 1820s; Edwin's younger half-brother was baseball icon &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Chadwick%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Henry Chadwick&lt;/a&gt;, born in 1824.\nAt 18, Chadwick decided to pursue a career in law and undertook an apprenticeship at an attorney's office. In 1823, he enrolled in law school at &lt;a href=\"Inns%20of%20Court\"&gt;The Temple&lt;/a&gt; in London. On 26 November 1830 he was &lt;a href=\"call%20to%20the%20bar\"&gt;called to the bar&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a &lt;a href=\"barrister\"&gt;barrister&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalled to the bar without independent means, he sought to support himself by literary work such as his work on 'Applied Science and its Place in Democracy', and his essays in the \"&lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Review\"&gt;Westminster Review&lt;/a&gt;\", mainly on different methods of applying scientific knowledge to the practice of government. He became friends with two of the leading philosophers of the day, &lt;a href=\"John%20Stuart%20Mill\"&gt;John Stuart Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Bentham\"&gt;Jeremy Bentham&lt;/a&gt;. Bentham engaged him as a literary assistant and left him a large legacy. He also became acquaintanced with &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Southwood%20Smith\"&gt;Thomas Southwood Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Arnott\"&gt;Neil Arnott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Kay-Shuttleworth\"&gt;James Kay-Shuttleworth&lt;/a&gt;, all doctors.\nFrom his exposure to social reform and under the influence of his friends, he began to devote his efforts to sanitary reform. In 1832, Chadwick began on his path to make improvements with sanitary and health conditions.\nReformer.\nIn 1832, he was employed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission%20into%20the%20Operation%20of%20the%20Poor%20Laws%201832\"&gt;Royal Commission&lt;/a&gt; appointed to inquire into the operation of the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law\"&gt;Poor Law&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1833, he was made a full member of that commission. Chadwick and &lt;a href=\"Nassau%20William%20Senior\"&gt;Nassau William Senior&lt;/a&gt; drafted the famous report of 1834, recommending the reform of the old law. Under the 1834 system, individual parishes were formed into &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law%20Unions\"&gt;Poor Law Unions&lt;/a&gt;, and each Poor Law Union was to have a union &lt;a href=\"workhouse\"&gt;workhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Chadwick favoured a more centralised system of administration than the one adopted, and he felt the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20movement\"&gt;Poor Law reform&lt;/a&gt; of 1834 should have provided for the management of poor law relief by salaried officers controlled from a central board, with the boards of guardians acting merely as inspectors.\nIn 1834, he was appointed secretary to the Poor Law commissioners. Unwilling to administer an act of which he was largely the author in any way other than as he thought best, he found it hard to get along with his superiors. The disagreement, among others, contributed to the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law%20Commission\"&gt;Poor Law Commission&lt;/a&gt; in 1847. His chief contribution to political controversy was his belief in entrusting certain departments of local affairs to trained and selected experts instead of to representatives, elected on the principle of local self-government.\nSanitation.\nFollowing a serious outbreak of &lt;a href=\"typhus\"&gt;typhus&lt;/a&gt; in 1838, Chadwick convinced the Poor Law Board that an enquiry was required, and this was initially carried out by his doctor friends Arnot and Southwood Smith, assisted by another doctor from Manchester, James Kay Shuttleworth. This was the first time in British history that doctors were employed to look at the conditions which might contribute to ill health in the population. Chadwick sent questionnaires to every Poor Law Union, and talked to surveyors, builders, prison governors, police officers and factory inspectors to obtain additional data about the lives of the poor. He edited the information himself, and prepared it for publication. His \"&lt;a href=\"Report%20on%20The%20Sanitary%20Condition%20of%20the%20Labouring%20Population%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;\", begun in 1839 and published in 1842, was researched and published at his own expense, and became the best-selling publication produced by &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Public%20Sector%20Information\"&gt;the Stationery Office&lt;/a&gt; to date. A supplementary report was also published in 1843.\nHe employed John Roe, the surveyor for the district of Holborn and Finsbury who had invented the egg-shaped sewer, to conduct experiments on the most efficient ways to construct drains, the results of which were incorporated into the report, and the summary included eight points, including the absolute necessity of better water supplies and of a drainage system to remove waste, as ways to diminish premature mortality. Evidence given by Dr Dyce Guthrie convinced Chadwick that every house should have a permanent water supply, rather than the intermittent supplies from standpipes that were often provided. The report caught the public imagination, and the government had to set up a Royal Commission on the Health of Towns to consider the issues and recommend legislation. Its chairman was the Duke of Baccleuch, and there were thirteen members, including the engineers &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Stephenson\"&gt;Robert Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Cubitt\"&gt;William Cubitt&lt;/a&gt;. Chadwick acted as secretary in an unofficial capacity, and seems to have dominated the proceedings.\nThe Commission took evidence from &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Thom%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;Robert Thom&lt;/a&gt;, who had designed a water supply system for &lt;a href=\"Greenock\"&gt;Greenock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Wicksteed\"&gt;Thomas Wicksteed&lt;/a&gt;, who was the engineer for the &lt;a href=\"East%20London%20Waterworks%20Company\"&gt;East London Waterworks Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Hawksley\"&gt;Thomas Hawksley&lt;/a&gt; from the Trent Waterworks, &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. These confirmed his ideas about constant water supplies, and he developed a model which he called the \"venous and arterial system.\" Each house would have a constant water supply, and &lt;a href=\"water-closet\"&gt;water-closet&lt;/a&gt;s would ensure that soil was discharged into egg-shaped sewers, to be carried away and spread on the land as manure, preventing rivers from becoming polluted. Followed the publication of the Commission's report, the &lt;a href=\"Health%20of%20Towns%20Association\"&gt;Health of Towns Association&lt;/a&gt; was formed and various city-based branches were created. Chadwick later helped to ensure that the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 became law, to limit the profits that water supply companies could make to 10 percent, and requiring them to comply with reasonable demands for water. This included a constant supply of wholesome water for houses, and a supply for cleansing sewers and watering streets.\nChadwick wanted to see his ideas implemented over a wide area, and set about forming a company to supply water to towns, to ensure their drainage and cleansing, and to use the refuse for agricultural production. It was to have the grandiose title \"The British, Colonial and Foreign Drainage, Water Supply and Towns Improvement Company\", with an initial capital of \u00a31 million, but it was the time of the &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Mania\"&gt;Railway Mania&lt;/a&gt;, and he struggled to raise the finance against such competition. The company when it was eventually registered became the more modest Towns Improvement Company. Railways continued to dominate the money market, and the company was wound up after just three years. Chadwick understood that both water supply and drainage were important, since replacing &lt;a href=\"earth-closet\"&gt;earth-closet&lt;/a&gt;s with water closets resulted in cesspools overflowing and making sanitary conditions worse, unless there were sewers to carry the waste away. This led to a rift forming between him and Hawksley, who had initially worked closely with him but who later took on water supply projects which did not include any requirement for drainage.\nPublic Health Act.\nChadwick's report led to the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Health%20Act%201848\"&gt;Public Health Act 1848&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first instance of the British government taking responsibility for the health of its citizens. It had been introduced by &lt;a href=\"George%20Howard%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle\"&gt;Lord Morpeth&lt;/a&gt; in 1847, with the aim or requiring every town to supply water to every house, which they could do by building their own waterworks or by liaising with water companies, and to undertake drainage, sewerage and street paving projects. Most of its grand aims were considerably watered down by the time it became law, but it established a Central Board of Health, whose members were Lord Morpeth, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury\"&gt;Lord Shaftesbury&lt;/a&gt;, and Chadwick. They were later joined by Southwood Smith, who acted as a medical advisor. Districts could pay for a survey from an inspector employed by the Board, and could then proceed without the need to obtain a costly local Act to authorise the work. Chadwick chose all of the inspectors himself, ensuring that they shared his views on glazed sewer pipes, constant water supply and arterial drainage. They worked enthusiastically, ensuring that districts considered comprehensive schemes for water supply, drainage and sewerage.\nRatepayers in a district could request an inspector to attend if ten percent of them signed a petition. The Board could also hold an enquiry if the death rate of a district exceeded 23 per 1000, but gauged the level of local support, and formed a local Board if there was support, and withdrew tactfully if there was opposition. By 1853, they had received requests for inspections from 284 towns, and 13 combined water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes had been completed under the legislation. Relationships with engineers were not always easy, with &lt;a href=\"James%20Meadows%20Rendel%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;J. M. Rendel&lt;/a&gt; calling Chadwick's ideas \"sanitary humbug\" and Robert Stephenson stating that he hated the ideas of pipes, rather than brick-built sewers. Even &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Bazalgette\"&gt;Joseph Bazalgette&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to design London's trunk sewer network, spoke out against glazed sewer pipes. As time went by, there was growing opposition to what was seen as central control by the Board. The rift between Chadwick and Hawksley had become open hostility, and Hawksley made serious complaints against Chadwick and one of the Board's inspectors to a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1853. Opposition from engineers increased, and a \"Private Enterprise Society\" was formed by Hawksley and &lt;a href=\"James%20Simpson%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;James Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of bringing down the Board. Shaftsbury, Chadwick and Southwood Smith all had to resign in 1854, and the Board did not last for long afterwards. Chadwick lived to see his position vindicated when the Local Government Board was established in 1871, which led to the formation of the Ministry of Health. Since then, it has been widely acknowledged that public health is a matter of government responsibility, working through local authorities.\nIn 1851, Chadwick made a recommendation that a single authority should take over the nine separate water supply companies that operated in London. Although this idea was rejected by the Government, the Metropolitan Water Supply Act 1852 forced the companies to move the intakes for their water to locations above &lt;a href=\"Teddington%20Lock\"&gt;Teddington weir&lt;/a&gt;, to filter water before it was used for domestic supply, to cover filtered water reservoirs, and to ensure that there was a constant water supply to all users by 1857. This was not achieved until 1899, and Chadwick's recommendation for a single authority was eventually implemented in 1902, with the formation of the Metropolitan Water Board.\nIn 1852, Chadwick conversed with &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Llewelyn%20Dillwyn\"&gt;Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the construction of a sewerage system in Swansea.\nChadwick's efforts were acknowledged by at least one health reformer of the day: &lt;a href=\"Erasmus%20Wilson\"&gt;Erasmus Wilson&lt;/a&gt; dedicated his 1854 book \"Healthy Skin\" to Chadwick \"In admiration of his strenuous and indefatigable labours in the cause of Sanitary Reform\".\nHe corresponded with &lt;a href=\"Florence%20Nightingale\"&gt;Florence Nightingale&lt;/a&gt; on methodology. He encouraged her to write up her research into the book \"Notes on Nursing.\" He promoted it among well placed intellectuals, making her more visible.\nLater life.\nChadwick was a commissioner of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Commission%20of%20Sewers\"&gt;Metropolitan Commission of Sewers&lt;/a&gt; in London from 1848 to 1849. He was also a commissioner of the &lt;a href=\"Local%20board%20of%20health%23General%20Board%20of%20Health\"&gt;General Board of Health&lt;/a&gt; from its establishment in 1848 to its abolition in 1854, when he retired on a pension. He occupied the remainder of his life in voluntary contributions to sanitary, health and economic questions.\nIn January 1884, he was appointed as the first president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now the &lt;a href=\"Chartered%20Institute%20of%20Environmental%20Health\"&gt;Chartered Institute of Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt;. Its head office, in &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%2C%20London\"&gt;Waterloo, London&lt;/a&gt;, is named Chadwick Court, in his honour.\nWhile he is well known for his work with the Poor Law and with sanitation, he also contributed to other areas of public policy. These included tropical hygiene, criminal justice institutions, policy regarding funerals and burials in urban areas, school architecture, utilisation of sewage, military sanitation and the education of paupers. He was involved in investigations into child labour in factories, the organisation of the police force, drunkenness, the treatment of labourers on the railways, the building and maintenance of roads, organisation of the civil service, and various aspects of education. Most of these benefitted from his use of statistical methods to collect and organise data, and of the use of anecdotal evidence to support his conclusions. He was involved in a number of organisations, including the &lt;a href=\"British%20Science%20Association\"&gt;British Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Civil%20Engineers\"&gt;Institute of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20Social%20Science\"&gt;National Association for the Promotion of Social Science&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Society of Arts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Statistical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Statistical Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"London%20Debating%20Societies\"&gt;London Debating Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Political%20Economy%20Club\"&gt;Political Economy Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn recognition of his public service, he was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed in 1889. He served in his post until his death, at 90, in 1890, at &lt;a href=\"East%20Sheen\"&gt;East Sheen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecognition.\nChadwick is remembered at the &lt;a href=\"London%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20%26amp%3B%20Tropical%20Medicine\"&gt;London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; where his name appears among the names of 23 pioneers of public health and tropical medicine chosen to be honoured when the School was built in 1929.\nHe is also commemorated at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland for the engineering building.\nAccording to Priti Joshi in 2004 the evaluation of his career has drastically changed since the 1950s:\nSuch views are not universally held. Thus Ekelund and Price in their assessment of Chadwick's economic policies in 2012 wrote:\nReferences.\nAttribution:"
