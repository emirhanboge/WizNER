    "text": "\"Nathan Jones\" is a song by American girl group &lt;a href=\"the%20Supremes\"&gt;the Supremes&lt;/a&gt; from their twenty-third studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Touch%20%28The%20Supremes%20album%29\"&gt;Touch&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971). It was released on April 15, 1971, as the album's lead single. Produced by Frank Wilson and written by &lt;a href=\"Kathleen%20Wakefield\"&gt;Kathy Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Caston%20Jr.\"&gt;Leonard Caston&lt;/a&gt;, \"Nathan Jones\" was one of eight top-40 entries the Supremes recorded after its original frontwoman, &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Ross\"&gt;Diana Ross&lt;/a&gt;, left the group for a solo career.\nBackground.\nThe song centers around a woman's longing for her former lover, a man named Nathan Jones, who left her nearly a year ago \"to ease [his] mind.\" Suffering through the long separation (\"Winter's past, spring, and fall\") without any contact or communication between herself and Jones, the narrator is no longer in love with Jones, remarking that \"Nathan Jones/you've been gone too long\".\nSupremes version.\n\"Nathan Jones\" is an unusual entry among the Supremes' singles repertoire for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that all three members of the group (&lt;a href=\"Jean%20Terrell\"&gt;Jean Terrell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Wilson%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Mary Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cindy%20Birdsong\"&gt;Cindy Birdsong&lt;/a&gt;) sing the song's lead vocal in unison. &lt;a href=\"Clydie%20King\"&gt;Clydie King&lt;/a&gt; was asked to sing along with the group to give the song a fuller vocal sound. While working on the song, producer Frank Wilson had in mind a &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt; style of phrasing for the song, resulting in the unison vocals. The unison vocals would repeatedly be dubbed to create a layered harmonic tone. In addition, Wilson had his engineer, Cal Harris, use what can (now) be considered classic studio sensibilities to take &lt;a href=\"The%20Funk%20Brothers\"&gt;The Funk Brothers&lt;/a&gt;' backing tracks for \"Nathan Jones\" and give them a &lt;a href=\"Phaser%20%28effect%29\"&gt;phase shifting&lt;/a&gt; sound at various points during the song. This was accomplished by either using a second recorder (as the Beatles would have done) or (less likely) an outboard processor such as the blue faced MXR &lt;a href=\"flanger\"&gt;flanger&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased as a single on April 15, 1971, with \"Happy is a Bumpy Road\" as its &lt;a href=\"B-side\"&gt;B-side&lt;/a&gt;, \"Nathan Jones\" peaked at number 16 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Pop Singles&lt;/a&gt; chart and number eight on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;\"Billboard\" R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; chart. Overseas, the single reached number five on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. \"Nathan Jones\" was the most successful single released from the Supremes' fourteenth regular studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Touch%20%28Supremes%20album%29\"&gt;Touch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBananarama version.\n\"Nathan Jones\" was covered by English girl group &lt;a href=\"Bananarama\"&gt;Bananarama&lt;/a&gt;. There are three distinct versions of Bananarama's rendition of the song.\nThe first version was released on their 1987 album \"&lt;a href=\"Wow%21%20%28Bananarama%20album%29\"&gt;Wow!&lt;/a&gt;\", with their original line-up. This version was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1988 film \"&lt;a href=\"Rain%20Man\"&gt;Rain Man&lt;/a&gt;\". Some of the vocals were &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sampled&lt;/a&gt; on their \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Heard%20a%20Rumour\"&gt;I Heard a Rumour&lt;/a&gt;\" B-side song \"Clean Cut Boy\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Siobhan%20Fahey\"&gt;Siobhan Fahey&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Jacquie%20O%27Sullivan\"&gt;Jacquie O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, Bananarama re-recorded the song (with completely new vocal and instrumental arrangements), dubbed the Psycho Mix. This new version was initially included on vinyl and cassette issues of \"Greatest Hits Collection\". It was then remixed and released as a single, peaking at number 15 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. This version is considered the \"official\" version of the song, and is the version used for the accompanying music video.\nA third version of the single, the Dave Ford Mix, while similar to the Psycho Mix, opens with a staccato synthesiser instead of the single-note of the Psycho Mix, and includes more prominent synthesiser throughout. It uses the vocals from the Psycho Mix, although brought more to the front of the instrumentation. This mix appears on the Canadian version of \"Greatest Hits Collection\", and is the version which most closely resembles how it is heard when Bananarama plays live. (This mix is alternatively known as the \"Analogue\" mix, as it was never issued on CD until the \"Megarama\" compilation in 2015).\nAll three versions have 12\u2033 remixes available.\nMusic video.\nThe music video, directed by &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Morahan\"&gt;Andy Morahan&lt;/a&gt;, featured the girls performing the song with &lt;a href=\"Vogue%20%28dance%29\"&gt;vogue&lt;/a&gt;-style choreography with four male dancers dressed in British-style suits, hats, and umbrellas. Their performance is interspersed with shots of them strutting down a fashion catwalk in three different outfits, reflecting the three different seasons mentioned in the song (winter, spring, fall/autumn), and performing the main choreography in yet a fourth change of wardrobe. Sara and Keren are seen sharing the same black-with-copper-coloured-leaves jacket throughout.\nIndividual shots of the girls are accompanied by floating images of fruits and art objects, such as vases and statues.\nThe video was nominated for &lt;a href=\"Brit%20Award%20for%20British%20Video%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;British Video of the Year&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Brit%20Awards\"&gt;1989 Brit Awards&lt;/a&gt;, but lost to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson\"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Smooth%20Criminal\"&gt;Smooth Criminal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPerformances.\nThe group performed the song on several popular shows of the day, including \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20of%20the%20Pops\"&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt;\", The Great Big British Pop Machine, at the 1988 &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Variety%20Performance\"&gt;Royal Variety Performance&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of The &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt; and, famously, on the &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Wogan\"&gt;Terry Wogan&lt;/a&gt; show, in which Keren is seen doing the first verse choreography during the second verse. None of these appearances feature live vocals.\nOther versions.\n\"Nathan Jones\" has also been remade by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Davis%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Paul Davis&lt;/a&gt; (album \"&lt;a href=\"Cool%20Night\"&gt;Cool Night&lt;/a&gt;\", 1981) and by &lt;a href=\"Nicolette%20Larson\"&gt;Nicolette Larson&lt;/a&gt; (album \"&lt;a href=\"All%20Dressed%20Up%20and%20No%20Place%20to%20Go\"&gt;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go&lt;/a&gt;\", 1982)."
