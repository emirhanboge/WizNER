    "text": "The Immaculate Conception Parish Church (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Iglesia Parroquial de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n\"), commonly known as Guiuan Church, is a &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20church\"&gt;Roman Catholic church&lt;/a&gt; in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Guiuan%2C%20Eastern%20Samar\"&gt;Guiuan, Eastern Samar&lt;/a&gt;, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Borongan\"&gt;Diocese of Borongan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe church is classified as a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20National%20Cultural%20Treasures%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Cultural Treasure&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Museum of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. It was formerly nominated to the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage\"&gt;World Heritage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Sites of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; under two categories, the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20Churches%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Baroque Churches of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (Extension) and the Jesuit Churches of the Philippines.\nThe church, built in the 18th century, was significantly damaged when &lt;a href=\"Typhoon%20Haiyan\"&gt;Typhoon Haiyan&lt;/a&gt; (local name: Yolanda) made landfall in Guiuan and struck other parts of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Visayas\"&gt;Central Visayas&lt;/a&gt; on November 8, 2013. While the church's roof was destroyed and the fa\u00e7ade damaged, the church's walls were largely left intact. Restoration of the damaged church was completed in 2019.\nChurch history.\nGuiuan (also spelled as \"Guiguan\") was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Jesuits\"&gt;Jesuits&lt;/a&gt; in 1595. It was handed over to the &lt;a href=\"Augustinians\"&gt;Augustinians&lt;/a&gt; upon instructions from the Spanish colonial government due to the &lt;a href=\"Suppression%20of%20the%20Jesuits\"&gt;Jesuits Suppression&lt;/a&gt; in 1768. It was then transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Franciscans\"&gt;Franciscans&lt;/a&gt; in 1795 but due to lack of priests, Father Miguel P\u00e9rez, the first Franciscan priest of Guiuan was only assigned in 1804. The original church of Guiuan was made of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed by &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe present &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; church was dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt; under the title of the &lt;a href=\"Immaculate%20Conception\"&gt;Immaculate Conception&lt;/a&gt; and was built by the early Jesuits in 1718 and was renovated by adding a &lt;a href=\"transept\"&gt;transept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"baptistery\"&gt;baptistery&lt;/a&gt; during the term of Father Manuel Valverde and Pedro Monasterio in 1844. A &lt;a href=\"bell%20tower\"&gt;bell tower&lt;/a&gt; on top fort was built in 1854. Another convent was built by Father Arsenio Figueroa in 1872. The church was refurbished in 1935 and the sanctuary was renovated in 1987. On November 8, 2013, the church along with other buildings and structures in Guiuan was severely damaged due to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Typhoon%20Haiyan\"&gt;Typhoon Haiyan&lt;/a&gt;. While the roof was destroyed and the fa\u00e7ade was damaged, the church's stone walls remain unscathed, as do the floors and the crypts.\nHistorical and cultural declarations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Museum of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; named Guiuan Church a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20National%20Cultural%20Treasures%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Cultural Treasure&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. As a nominee for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines, it is grouped with &lt;a href=\"Maragondon%20Church\"&gt;Maragondon Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baclayon%20Church\"&gt;Baclayon Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loboc%20Church\"&gt;Loboc Church&lt;/a&gt; for the \"Jesuit Churches of the Philippines\" and with &lt;a href=\"Boljoon%20Church\"&gt;Boljoon Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loboc%20Church\"&gt;Loboc Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tumauini%20Church\"&gt;Tumauini Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazi%20Church\"&gt;Lazi Church&lt;/a&gt; for the \"Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension)\" nomination. However, due to its total destruction, it was then removed to the roster of nominated sites.\nOn March 18, 2021, as part of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Quincentennial%20Commemorations%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;2021 Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; marking the 500th anniversary of the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Magellan%E2%80%93Elcano%20circumnavigation\"&gt;Magellan\u2013Elcano circumnavigation&lt;/a&gt; to the Philippines, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines unveiled a historical marker commemorating the church.\nDescription.\nGuiuan Church is nestled inside a &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt;. It is well known for its extensive &lt;a href=\"Seashell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; ornamentation in its interiors. Studies revealed that at least eight types of seashells were used. Before its destruction, it still has two elaborately carved doors out of the original three doors. The main door on the entrance has exquisite carvings of the &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20apostles\"&gt;Twelve Apostles&lt;/a&gt; while a side door has carved representations of &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"First%20Spouse%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Former First Lady&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imelda%20Marcos\"&gt;Imelda Marcos&lt;/a&gt; was interested in purchasing the church's door for &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;\u20b1&lt;/a&gt;1,000,000 using government funds siphoned by her husband, Ferdinand Marcos.\nPresent condition.\nDue to Typhoon Haiyan, all of its original &lt;a href=\"retablo\"&gt;retablo&lt;/a&gt;, roof (dated 1700s) and other church relics were damaged. Only the stone walls and &lt;a href=\"bell%20tower\"&gt;bell tower&lt;/a&gt; remained standing. Restoration of the church is on-going under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Museum of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. Funds for the reconstruction of the church amounting to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;300,000 was given by the Embassy of the United States in the Philippines and \u20b1112 million from the National Museum of the Philippines. Restoration of the church was completed in 2019."
