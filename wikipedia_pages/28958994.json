    "text": "Bangladeshis ( ) are the &lt;a href=\"citizens\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;n country centered on the transnational &lt;a href=\"historical%20region\"&gt;historical region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Bengal\"&gt;eponymous bay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bangladeshi%20nationality%20law\"&gt;Bangladeshi citizenship&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 1971, when the permanent residents of the former &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; were transformed into citizens of a new republic. Bangladesh is the world's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20population\"&gt;eighth most populous nation&lt;/a&gt;. The vast majority of Bangladeshis are ethnolingustically &lt;a href=\"Bengalis\"&gt;Bengalis&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Indo-Aryan%20peoples\"&gt;Indo-Aryan people&lt;/a&gt;. The population of Bangladesh is concentrated in the fertile &lt;a href=\"Bengal%20delta\"&gt;Bengal delta&lt;/a&gt;, which has been the center of urban and agrarian civilizations for millennia. The country's highlands, including the &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts\"&gt;Chittagong Hill Tracts&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20Division\"&gt;Sylhet Division&lt;/a&gt;, are home to various tribal minorities.\n&lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Muslims\"&gt;Bengali Muslims&lt;/a&gt; are the predominant ethnoreligious group of Bangladesh with a population of 135.5 million, which makes up 90.4% of the country's population as of 2011. The minority &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Hindu\"&gt;Bengali Hindu&lt;/a&gt; population made up approximately 8.54% of the population of the country according to the 2011 Census Non-Bengali Muslims make up the largest immigrant community; while the &lt;a href=\"Tibeto-Burman\"&gt;Tibeto-Burman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chakma%20people\"&gt;Chakmas&lt;/a&gt;, who speak the Indo-Aryan &lt;a href=\"Chakma%20language\"&gt;Chakma language&lt;/a&gt;, are the largest indigenous ethnic group after Indo-Aryan Bengalis. The &lt;a href=\"Austroasiatic\"&gt;Austroasiatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Santhals\"&gt;Santhals&lt;/a&gt; are the largest aboriginal community.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bangladeshi%20diaspora\"&gt;Bangladeshi diaspora&lt;/a&gt; is concentrated in the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20world\"&gt;Arab world&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Bangladeshi\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. A significant number of Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) have &lt;a href=\"dual%20citizenship\"&gt;dual citizenship&lt;/a&gt; in different countries.\nTerminology.\nAfter Independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Bangladeshis, as a nationality, have been referred to by various terms:\nNone of these terms should be conflated with \"&lt;a href=\"Bengalis\"&gt;Bengalis&lt;/a&gt;\", the name of the predominant ethnic group in the country who make up the bulk of all Bangladeshis.\nDemographics.\nThe region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including &lt;a href=\"Indo-Aryan%20peoples\"&gt;Indo-Aryan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dravidian%20peoples\"&gt;Dravidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tibeto-Burman\"&gt;Tibeto-Burman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austroasiatic\"&gt;Austroasiatic&lt;/a&gt; ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP.\nReligious demographics.\nBangladesh has a population of 166,303,498 as per 2021, January official projections. As per as 2020 estimation research, around 13 million Bangladeshis lives abroad in the various foreign nation's. The estimated total population of all Bangladeshis including the ones who are living in their country and abroad is about 180 million as per 2020-21 estimation.\nBengalis.\nApproximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are &lt;a href=\"Bengalis\"&gt;Bengalis&lt;/a&gt;. East Bengal was a prosperous &lt;a href=\"melting%20pot\"&gt;melting pot&lt;/a&gt; for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20dialects\"&gt;dialects&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver 90.4% of the population are &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Muslim\"&gt;Bengali Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s (135.5 million) as of 2011. This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest &lt;a href=\"Islam%20by%20country\"&gt;Muslim majority country&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Muslims\"&gt;Arab Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the &lt;a href=\"Shia\"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahmadiya\"&gt;Ahmadiya&lt;/a&gt; branches. &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Hindus\"&gt;Bengali Hindus&lt;/a&gt; are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 12.73 million constituting 8.54% as per 2011 Census. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. There are an estimated 400,000 &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Christians\"&gt;Bengali Christians&lt;/a&gt; and 500,000 &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Buddhists\"&gt;Bengali Buddhists&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet-Division.\nNon-Bengali Muslims.\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; immigrants from different parts of &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;. They include affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class, particularly &lt;a href=\"Nizari%20Ismailism\"&gt;Nizari Ismailism&lt;/a&gt; adherents. They also include former &lt;a href=\"Stranded%20Pakistanis\"&gt;Stranded Pakistanis&lt;/a&gt; and their descendants. Bangladesh's non-Bengali Muslims are usually fluent in both Bengali and &lt;a href=\"Hindustani%20language\"&gt;Hindustani&lt;/a&gt;. Also there are over 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees living in Bangladesh who have came here during the period of (2016\u201317) crisis. On 28 September 2018, at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said there are 1.1-1.3 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.\nTribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\nIn southeastern Bangladesh, the &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts\"&gt;Chittagong Hill Tracts&lt;/a&gt; frontier has a district history. It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in &lt;a href=\"Bengal%20Presidency\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20people\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; ethnic groups in the three hill districts of &lt;a href=\"Rangamati\"&gt;Rangamati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandarban\"&gt;Bandarban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khagrachari\"&gt;Khagrachari&lt;/a&gt;. The three largest communities in the region have a &lt;a href=\"Raja\"&gt;Raja&lt;/a&gt; as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.\nTribes of North and Northeast Bangladesh.\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"Austroasiatic\"&gt;Austroasiatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tibeto-Burman\"&gt;Tibeto-Burman&lt;/a&gt; and Indo-Aryan tribes which inhabit parts of northern and northeastern Bangladesh.\nRural society.\nThe basic &lt;a href=\"social%20unit\"&gt;social unit&lt;/a&gt; in a village is the family (\"poribar\" or \"gushti\"), generally consisting of a complete or incomplete &lt;a href=\"patrilineal\"&gt;patrilineal&lt;/a&gt;ly extended household (\"chula\") and residing in a homestead (\"&lt;a href=\"bari\"&gt;bari&lt;/a&gt;\"). The individual &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20family\"&gt;nuclear family&lt;/a&gt; often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (\"ghor\"). Above the \"bari\" level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (\"shomaj\" or \"milat\"). Among the functions of a \"shomaj\" might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a &lt;a href=\"mullah\"&gt;mullah&lt;/a&gt;. An informal council of \"shomaj\" elders (\"matabdars\" or \"shordars\") settles village disputes. Factional competition between the \"motobdars\" is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.\nGroups of homes in a village are called \"Paras\", and each \"para\" has its own name. Several \"paras\" constitute a \"mauza\", the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common &lt;a href=\"thatched\"&gt;thatched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; huts.\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\nUrban society.\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities. &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous &lt;a href=\"megacities\"&gt;megacities&lt;/a&gt;. Other important cities include &lt;a href=\"Chittagong\"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylhet\"&gt;Sylhet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajshahi\"&gt;Rajshahi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jessore\"&gt;Jessore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barisal\"&gt;Barisal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comilla\"&gt;Comilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narayanganj\"&gt;Narayanganj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mymensingh\"&gt;Mymensingh&lt;/a&gt;. Most urban centers are rural administrative &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of &lt;a href=\"upazila\"&gt;upazila&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIdentity.\nBangladesh is noted for &lt;a href=\"cultural%20pluralism\"&gt;cultural pluralism&lt;/a&gt; within a &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Muslim\"&gt;Bengali Muslim&lt;/a&gt; majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali language&lt;/a&gt; is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Language%20Movement\"&gt;Bengali Language Movement&lt;/a&gt; sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War\"&gt;Bangladesh Liberation War&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt; under a secular parliamentary system. &lt;a href=\"Military%20coups%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Military coups&lt;/a&gt; ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the &lt;a href=\"free%20market\"&gt;free market&lt;/a&gt; and promoted moderate &lt;a href=\"Islamism\"&gt;Islamism&lt;/a&gt;. In 1988, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; was made the &lt;a href=\"state%20religion\"&gt;state religion&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of &lt;a href=\"Secularity\"&gt;separation of mosque and state&lt;/a&gt; in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion. The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities. Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts%20Peace%20Accord\"&gt;peace treaty&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect &lt;a href=\"adivasi\"&gt;adivasi&lt;/a&gt; land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of \"Bangalee\" as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religion is Islam, which has played a critical part in influencing the country's culture.\nLanguages.\nThe official language of Bangladesh is &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;, which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20dialects\"&gt;Bengali dialects&lt;/a&gt; vary between different regions of Bangladesh but Standard Bengali is the most widely used.\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at &lt;a href=\"Mahasthangarh\"&gt;Mahasthangarh&lt;/a&gt; and is written in the &lt;a href=\"Brahmi%20script\"&gt;Brahmi script&lt;/a&gt;. The language is &lt;a href=\"Magadhi%20Prakrit\"&gt;Magadhi Prakrit&lt;/a&gt;. The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from &lt;a href=\"Apabhramsa\"&gt;Apabhramsa&lt;/a&gt;, between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern &lt;a href=\"Indo-Aryan%20language\"&gt;Indo-Aryan language&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Assamese%20language\"&gt;Assamese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odia%20language\"&gt;Odia&lt;/a&gt;, but later became distinct. It became an official language of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Bengal\"&gt;Sultanate of Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farsi\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;. Bengali is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20languages%20by%20total%20number%20of%20speakers%23Top%20languages%20by%20population\"&gt;6th most spoken language in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The language was modernized during the &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Renaissance\"&gt;Bengali Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including &lt;a href=\"Chakma%20language\"&gt;Chakma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rohingya%20language\"&gt;Rohingya&lt;/a&gt;, Assamese, Odia and &lt;a href=\"Nepali%20language\"&gt;Nepali&lt;/a&gt;. The indigenous &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20alphabet\"&gt;Bengali alphabet&lt;/a&gt;s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Language%20Movement\"&gt;Bengali Language Movement&lt;/a&gt; in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"International%20Mother%20Language%20Day\"&gt;International Mother Language Day&lt;/a&gt;, as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including &lt;a href=\"Santhali%20language\"&gt;Santhali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garo%20language\"&gt;Garo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marma%20language\"&gt;Marma&lt;/a&gt;, Chakma and &lt;a href=\"Bishnupriya%20Manipuri%20language\"&gt;Bisnupriya Manipuri&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurnames.\nBangladeshi Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames."
