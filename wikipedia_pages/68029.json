    "text": "Bilbao (, , ; ) is a city in northern &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city in the &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. It is also the largest city proper in northern Spain. Bilbao is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Spain%20by%20population\"&gt;tenth largest city&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, with a population of 345,141 as of 2015. The &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Bilbao metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; has 1,037,847 inhabitants, making it one of the most populous &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;s in northern Spain; with a population of 875,552 the &lt;a href=\"Comarcas%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;comarca&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bilbao\"&gt;Greater Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Greater Basque region&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilbao is situated in the north-central part of Spain, some south of the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, where the economic social development is located, where the &lt;a href=\"estuary%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;estuary of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small &lt;a href=\"mountain%20range\"&gt;mountain range&lt;/a&gt;s with an average elevation of . Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian&lt;/a&gt; standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.\nAfter its foundation in the early 14th century by &lt;a href=\"Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20V%20de%20Haro\"&gt;Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro&lt;/a&gt;, head of the powerful &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Haro\"&gt;Haro&lt;/a&gt; family, Bilbao was one of the commercial hubs of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; that enjoyed significant importance in the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Crown of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. This was due to its thriving &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;port activity&lt;/a&gt; based on the export of wool and iron commodities extracted from the Biscayan quarries to all over Europe. Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the center of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous &lt;a href=\"service%20sector\"&gt;service city&lt;/a&gt; that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Guggenheim%20Museum\"&gt;Bilbao Guggenheim Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Airport\"&gt;airport terminal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Bilbao\"&gt;rapid transit system&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20tram\"&gt;tram line&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azkuna%20Zentroa\"&gt;Azkuna Zentroa&lt;/a&gt;, and the currently under development &lt;a href=\"Abandoibarra\"&gt;Abandoibarra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zorrozaurre\"&gt;Zorrozaurre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"urban%20renewal\"&gt;renewal&lt;/a&gt; projects.\nBilbao is also home to &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao\"&gt;Athletic Club&lt;/a&gt;, a significant symbol for &lt;a href=\"Basque%20nationalism\"&gt;Basque nationalism&lt;/a&gt; due to its &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy\"&gt;promotion of only Basque players&lt;/a&gt; and being one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history.\nOn 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with the Swedish &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Considered the Nobel Prize for &lt;a href=\"urbanism\"&gt;urbanism&lt;/a&gt;, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, &lt;a href=\"I%C3%B1aki%20Azkuna\"&gt;I\u00f1aki Azkuna&lt;/a&gt;, received the 2012 &lt;a href=\"World%20Mayor\"&gt;World Mayor&lt;/a&gt; Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s. On 8 November 2017, Bilbao was chosen the Best European City 2018 at The Urbanism Awards 2018, awarded by the international organisation The Academy of Urbanism.\nEtymology.\nThe official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. &lt;a href=\"Euskaltzaindia\"&gt;Euskaltzaindia&lt;/a&gt;, the official regulatory institution of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque language&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, \"Bilbao\" and \"Bilbo\", the historical name is \"Bilbo\", while \"Bilbao\" is the official name. Although the term \"Bilbo\" does not appear in old documents, in the play \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor\"&gt;The Merry Wives of Windsor&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;, there is a reference to swords presumably made of Biscayan iron which he calls \"&lt;a href=\"bilbo%20%28sword%29\"&gt;bilboes&lt;/a&gt;\", suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.\nThere is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja (\"Old Bilbao\"). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day. One possible origin was suggested by the engineer &lt;a href=\"Evaristo%20de%20Churruca%20y%20Brunet\"&gt;Evaristo de Churruca&lt;/a&gt;. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: \"Bil-Ibaia-Bao\". The historian Jos\u00e9 Tussel G\u00f3mez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words \"bello vado\", beautiful river crossing. On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present &lt;a href=\"Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Casco Viejo&lt;/a&gt; is located, would be called \"billa\", which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now &lt;a href=\"Bilbo%20Zarra\"&gt;Bilbao La Vieja&lt;/a&gt; is located, would be called \"vaho\", Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao, which was also written as \"Bilvao\" and \"Biluao\", as documented in its &lt;a href=\"municipal%20charter\"&gt;municipal charter&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn \"-ao\" ending is also present in nearby &lt;a href=\"Sestao\"&gt;Sestao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ugao-Miraballes\"&gt;Ugao&lt;/a&gt;, that could be explained from Basque \"aho\", \"mouth\".\nDemonym.\nThe demonym is \"bilba\u00edno, -a\", although the popular pronunciation \"bilbaino/a\" (sic) is also frequent. In &lt;a href=\"euskera\"&gt;euskera&lt;/a&gt; it is \"bilbotar\", which is sometimes also used in Spanish, generally within the Basque Country. \nThe village is affectionately known by its inhabitants as the \"\" meaning \"hole\", since it is surrounded by mountains. The nickname \"botxero\" is derived from this nickname. Another nickname that Bilbao receives is that of \"chimbos\", which comes from birds that were hunted in large numbers in these places during the 19th century.\nThe titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao's traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.\nBilbao holds the historic category of township (\"villa\"), with the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten\" (\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta\"). It was the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Monarchs\"&gt;Catholic Monarchs&lt;/a&gt; who awarded the title \"Noble Town\" (\"Noble Villa\") on 20 September 1475. &lt;a href=\"Philip%20III%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip III of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, via a letter in 1603 awarded the town the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal\". After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bilbao%20%281836%29\"&gt;Siege of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;First Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;, on 25 December 1836, the title of \"Unbeaten\" was added.\nThe &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"blazon\"&gt;emblazoned&lt;/a&gt; as follows:\nThe flag that represents it is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colors red and white are the historical ones of the villa.\nThe Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the \" Bilbao Consulate \" was wearing was white with a red &lt;a href=\"Cross%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Cross of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one \" Bilbao Consulate \" are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.\nThe definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town's representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.\nAlthough it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about \"the use of the crimson color of the &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Lordship of Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, or of the &lt;a href=\"Saltire\"&gt;cross of Saint Andrew&lt;/a&gt;\" but without reaching any resolution to the effect.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nRemains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount Malmas\u00edn, dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC. Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as \"Amanun Portus\", cited by &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, or with \"Flaviobriga\", by &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedieval Bilbao.\nAncient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20San%20Ant%C3%B3n\"&gt;Church of San Ant\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. Bilbao was one of the first towns founded in the fourteenth century, during a period in which approximately three-quarters of the &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;an cities were developed, among them &lt;a href=\"Portugalete\"&gt;Portugalete&lt;/a&gt; in 1323, &lt;a href=\"Ondarroa\"&gt;Ondarroa&lt;/a&gt; in 1327, &lt;a href=\"Lekeitio\"&gt;Lekeitio&lt;/a&gt; in 1335, and &lt;a href=\"Mungia\"&gt;Mungia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Larrabetzu\"&gt;Larrabetzu&lt;/a&gt; in 1376. &lt;a href=\"Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20V%20de%20Haro\"&gt;Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro&lt;/a&gt;, then third &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Lord of Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, founded Bilbao through a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20charter\"&gt;municipal charter&lt;/a&gt; dated in &lt;a href=\"Valladolid\"&gt;Valladolid&lt;/a&gt; on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Ferdinand IV of Castile&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burgos\"&gt;Burgos&lt;/a&gt;, on 4 January 1301. Diego L\u00f3pez established the new town on the right bank of the &lt;a href=\"Nervi%C3%B3n%20river\"&gt;Nervi\u00f3n river&lt;/a&gt;, on the grounds of the \"&lt;a href=\"elizate\"&gt;elizate&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and granted it the \"&lt;a href=\"fuero\"&gt;fuero&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Logro%C3%B1o\"&gt;Logro\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.\nIn 1310 &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20D%C3%ADaz%20I%20de%20Haro\"&gt;Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz I de Haro&lt;/a&gt;, niece of Diego L\u00f3pez V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from &lt;a href=\"Castile%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Castile&lt;/a&gt; towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from &lt;a href=\"Ordu%C3%B1a-Urdu%C3%B1a\"&gt;Ordu\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bermeo\"&gt;Bermeo&lt;/a&gt;, at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the &lt;a href=\"San%20Ant%C3%B3n%20Bridge\"&gt;San Ant\u00f3n Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in Bilbao instead of the pass in &lt;a href=\"Etxebarri\"&gt;Etxebarri&lt;/a&gt;, as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory. In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Arenas\"&gt;Las Arenas&lt;/a&gt;. In 1372, &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;John I of Castile&lt;/a&gt; strengthened even more the city's position by naming Bilbao a &lt;a href=\"Free%20economic%20zone\"&gt;free port&lt;/a&gt; and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron. This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; and Great Britain.\nIn 1443 the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Saint%20Anthony%20the%20Great\"&gt;Church of Saint Anthony the Great&lt;/a&gt; was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old \"&lt;a href=\"alc%C3%A1zar\"&gt;alc\u00e1zar&lt;/a&gt;\". Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Isabella I of Castile&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband, &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Ferdinand II of Aragon&lt;/a&gt; had already done so in 1476 in &lt;a href=\"Gernika\"&gt;Gernika&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern age.\nOn 21 June 1511, Queen &lt;a href=\"Joanna%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Joanna of Castile&lt;/a&gt; ordered the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Consulate%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Consulate of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate's control, the &lt;a href=\"port%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;port of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; became one of the most important of the kingdom. The first &lt;a href=\"printing-press\"&gt;printing-press&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque language&lt;/a&gt; was edited, entitled \"Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence\" by Dr. Betolaza.\nIn 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, a title previously held by &lt;a href=\"Bermeo\"&gt;Bermeo&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the \"\"Machinada\" of the salt\". The revolt ended with the execution of several of its leaders. The city had seen a continuous increase of its wealth, especially after the discovery of extensive iron deposits in the surrounding mountains, and by the end of the century it managed to overcome the economic crises that affected the rest of the kingdom, thanks in part to the increased trading of wool (which now used the port of Bilbao instead of the one in &lt;a href=\"Santander%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Santander&lt;/a&gt;), and to the iron ore and its commerce with England and the Netherlands.\nIn 1791, the city of \"Nueva Bilbao\" (\"New Bilbao\" - now known as \"&lt;a href=\"Constituci%C3%B3n%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Constituci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\") was founded in Chile, at the time a remote colony of the Spanish Empire.\nContemporary Bilbao.\nNapoleonic invasion and Carlist wars.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Spain%20under%20Joseph%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleonic rule&lt;/a&gt; took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bail%C3%A9n\"&gt;Battle of Bail\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a on 16 August. Beginning in February 1810, the city was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Thouvenot\"&gt;Pierre Thouvenot&lt;/a&gt;, general of the French army and &lt;a href=\"Nobility%20of%20the%20First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;Baron of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who had become the head of the Military Government of \"Vizcaya\", which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France, but the &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20War\"&gt;Peninsular War&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Vitoria\"&gt;Battle of Vitoria&lt;/a&gt; made those plans impossible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; was one of the main sites of battles during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;First Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Christina%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Maria Christina&lt;/a&gt;, known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother &lt;a href=\"Infante%20Carlos%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina\"&gt;Carlos of Borb\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, known as Carlists. The &lt;a href=\"Carlism\"&gt;Carlists&lt;/a&gt; were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20de%20Zumalac%C3%A1rregui\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui&lt;/a&gt; tried to take the city during the Siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near &lt;a href=\"Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and died some time after in the town of &lt;a href=\"Zegama\"&gt;Zegama&lt;/a&gt;. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general &lt;a href=\"Baldomero%20Espartero%2C%20Prince%20of%20Vergara\"&gt;Baldomero Espartero&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Carlists in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Luchana\"&gt;Battle of Luchana&lt;/a&gt;. The city was untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;Second Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;, which took place mostly in &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;, but was again an important scenario during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;Third Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.\nDespite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the &lt;a href=\"BBVA\"&gt;BBVA&lt;/a&gt;) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the &lt;a href=\"Altos%20Hornos%20de%20Vizcaya\"&gt;Altos Hornos de Vizcaya&lt;/a&gt; in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall building&lt;/a&gt;, the Basurto Hospital and the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Arriaga\"&gt;Arriaga Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably &lt;a href=\"Basque%20nationalism\"&gt;Basque nationalism&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sabino%20Arana\"&gt;Sabino Arana&lt;/a&gt;, which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Nationalist%20Party\"&gt;Basque Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil war and Francoist dictatorship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in Bilbao started with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with a series of air bombs dropped by &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Nationalist&lt;/a&gt; airplanes. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city. In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.\nWith the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by &lt;a href=\"Francoism\"&gt;Francoism&lt;/a&gt;. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides. It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the \"Euskalduna\" shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the separatist organisation &lt;a href=\"ETA%20%28separatist%20group%29\"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; was created from Basque nationalist movements. During the 1960s the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the University of Bilbao, the first public university, was established. It would later be integrated into the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemocracy and urban renewal.\nAfter the end of &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20State\"&gt;Francoist Spain&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, in a process known in Spain as &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy\"&gt;the transition&lt;/a&gt;, Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time &lt;a href=\"Basque%20nationalism\"&gt;Basque nationalists&lt;/a&gt; rose to power. With the approval of the &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Autonomy%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; in 1979, &lt;a href=\"Vitoria-Gasteiz\"&gt;Vitoria-Gasteiz&lt;/a&gt; was elected the seat of the government and therefore the \"de facto\" capital of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Autonomous Community&lt;/a&gt;, although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labor demands and the arrival of cheap labor from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.\nOn 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as \"&lt;a href=\"Aste%20Nagusia\"&gt;Aste Nagusia&lt;/a&gt;\", the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two people and causing important destructions in the city's infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20peseta\"&gt;pesetas&lt;/a&gt; (around 360 million &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;)\nSince the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and &lt;a href=\"urban%20renewal\"&gt;urban renewal&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Guggenheim%20Museum\"&gt;Bilbao Guggenheim Museum&lt;/a&gt; (the so-called \"Guggenheim effect\"), and continuing with the &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna%20Conference%20Centre%20and%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Calatrava\"&gt;Santiago Calatrava&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zubizuri\"&gt;Zubizuri&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Bilbao\"&gt;metro network&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Foster%2C%20Baron%20Foster%20of%20Thames%20Bank\"&gt;Norman Foster&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Iberdrola%20Tower\"&gt;Iberdrola Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zorrozaurre\"&gt;Zorrozaurre&lt;/a&gt; development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metr\u00f3poli-30 and Bilbao R\u00eda 2000 were created to monitor these projects.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nBilbao is located near the northern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, about from the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt;. It covers an area of , of which are urban and the remaining consist of the surrounding mountains. The official average altitude is , although there are measurements between and . It is also the core of the \"&lt;a href=\"Comarcas%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;comarca&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bilbao\"&gt;Greater Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;. It is surrounded by the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Derio\"&gt;Derio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Etxebarri\"&gt;Etxebarri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galdakao\"&gt;Galdakao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loiu\"&gt;Loiu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sondika\"&gt;Sondika&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zamudio\"&gt;Zamudio&lt;/a&gt; to the north; &lt;a href=\"Arrigorriaga\"&gt;Arrigorriaga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basauri\"&gt;Basauri&lt;/a&gt; to the west; &lt;a href=\"Alonsotegi\"&gt;Alonsotegi&lt;/a&gt; to the south; and &lt;a href=\"Barakaldo\"&gt;Barakaldo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erandio\"&gt;Erandio&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nBilbao is located on the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20mountains\"&gt;Basque threshold&lt;/a&gt;, the range between the larger &lt;a href=\"Cantabrian%20Mountains\"&gt;Cantabrian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;. The soil is predominantly composed of &lt;a href=\"mesozoic\"&gt;mesozoic&lt;/a&gt; materials (&lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"marl\"&gt;marl&lt;/a&gt;) sedimented over a primitive &lt;a href=\"paleozoic\"&gt;paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; base. The relief of the province is dominated by NW-SE and WNW-ESE oriented folds. The main fold is the &lt;a href=\"anticline\"&gt;anticline&lt;/a&gt; of Bilbao which runs from the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Elorrio\"&gt;Elorrio&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Galdames\"&gt;Galdames&lt;/a&gt;. Inside Bilbao there are two secondary folds, one in the northeast, composed of Mounts &lt;a href=\"Artxanda\"&gt;Artxanda&lt;/a&gt;, Avril, Banderas, Pikota, San Bernab\u00e9, and Cabras; and other in the south, composed of Mounts Kobetas, Restaleku, &lt;a href=\"Pagasarri\"&gt;Pagasarri&lt;/a&gt; and Arraiz. The highest point in the municipality is Mount Ganeta, of , followed by Mount Pagasarri, of , both on the border with Alonsotegi.\nHydrology.\nThe main river system of Bilbao is also the hydrological artery of Biscay. The rivers &lt;a href=\"Nervi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Nervi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ibaizabal\"&gt;Ibaizabal&lt;/a&gt; converge in &lt;a href=\"Basauri\"&gt;Basauri&lt;/a&gt; and form an &lt;a href=\"estuary\"&gt;estuary&lt;/a&gt; named variously \"&lt;a href=\"estuary%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;estuary of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;\", \"of the Nervi\u00f3n\", \"of the Ibaizabal\", or \"of the Nervi\u00f3n-Ibaizabal\". The estuary runs for and with a low flow (with an average of per second). Its main tributary is the river &lt;a href=\"Cadagua\"&gt;Cadagua&lt;/a&gt;, which rises in the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20de%20Mena\"&gt;Mena valley&lt;/a&gt; and has a basin of , mostly lying in the neighboring province of &lt;a href=\"Burgos\"&gt;Burgos&lt;/a&gt;. This river is also the natural border between Bilbao and Barakaldo.\nThe river has frequently suffered from human intervention, as seen in the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial &lt;a href=\"waterway\"&gt;waterway&lt;/a&gt; dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of &lt;a href=\"Deusto\"&gt;Deusto&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"lateral%20canal\"&gt;lateral canal&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of &lt;a href=\"Zorrozaurre\"&gt;Zorrozaurre&lt;/a&gt;. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of &lt;a href=\"anoxic%20waters\"&gt;anoxia&lt;/a&gt; (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tonguefish\"&gt;tonguefish&lt;/a&gt;es, crabs, and &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.\nThe estuary is also a natural border for several neighbourhoods and districts within the borough. Entering the municipality from the west it separates the districts of &lt;a href=\"Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ibaiondo\"&gt;Ibaiondo&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uribarri\"&gt;Uribarri&lt;/a&gt; and lastly &lt;a href=\"Deusto\"&gt;Deusto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basurto-Zorroza\"&gt;Basurto-Zorroza&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nIts proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt; gives Bilbao an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cfb\"), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. Precipitation is abundant, and given the latitude and atmospheric dynamics, rainy days represent 45% and cloudy days 40% of the annual total. The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. &lt;a href=\"Rain%20and%20snow%20mixed\"&gt;Sleet&lt;/a&gt; is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months. Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of . There is also a drying trend in summer with only around of rainfall in July \u2013 but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.\nThe proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between .\nExtreme record observations in Bilbao are maximum (on 26 July 1947) and minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was on 26 August 1983 when severe flooding was caused by the Nervi\u00f3n river.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Statistics%20Office\"&gt;Basque Statistics Office&lt;/a&gt;, the population of Bilbao is 342,397 people as of 2017, distributed on a land area of , making Bilbao the largest city by population of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Autonomous Community&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Bilbao metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of 1,037,847 people.\nThe first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550. It is known that in 1530 &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt; had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plagues&lt;/a&gt; that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564\u201368, and 1597\u20131601, the last being especially devastating. This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the &lt;a href=\"Txorierri\"&gt;Txorierri&lt;/a&gt; valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.\nSpanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by the vernacular &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque language&lt;/a&gt;. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak \"some Basque\", while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.\nMigration.\nOut of the 355,731 people residing in Bilbao in 2009, only 114,220 (32.1%) were born inside the municipality. Of the remainder, 114,908 were born in other Biscayan towns, while 9,545 were born in the other two Basque provinces; 85,789 came from the rest of Spain (mainly &lt;a href=\"Castile-Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Castile-Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;), and 33,537 were foreigners. There are 127 different nationalities registered in Bilbao, although 60 of them represent fewer than 10 people each. The largest foreign communities are Bolivians and Colombians, with 4,879 and 3,730 respectively. Other nationalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants are Romanians (2,248), Moroccans (2,058), Ecuadorians (1,832), Chinese (1,390), Brazilians (1,273) and Paraguayans, with 1,204.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Bilbao is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt; and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20Communities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;autonomous&lt;/a&gt; and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque autonomous government&lt;/a&gt;, each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Government of Spain&lt;/a&gt; has the official &lt;a href=\"Government%20Sub-delegation%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Government Subdelegation&lt;/a&gt; in the city.\nMunicipal government.\nBilbao is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href=\"Mayor%E2%80%93council%20government\"&gt;mayor-council government system&lt;/a&gt;. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt; and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative. The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 &lt;a href=\"councillor\"&gt;councillor&lt;/a&gt;s. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.\nSince 1892 the seat of the government has been the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Bilbao City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, located on the centric Ernesto Erkoreka plaza and by the &lt;a href=\"Estuary%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;Estuary of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Saint%20Anthony%20the%20Great\"&gt;San Ant\u00f3n Church&lt;/a&gt; but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaqu\u00edn Rucoba in &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque style&lt;/a&gt; and was built in the former site of the San Agust\u00edn Monastery, which was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;First Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy\"&gt;Spanish transition to democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the city has been governed by the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Nationalist%20Party\"&gt;Basque Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt;, often with support of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country%E2%80%93Basque%20Country%20Left\"&gt;Socialist Party of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"I%C3%B1aki%20Azkuna\"&gt;I\u00f1aki Azkuna&lt;/a&gt; served as mayor from 1999 until his passing in 2014, when he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ibon%20Areso\"&gt;Ibon Areso&lt;/a&gt;. Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor prize in 2012. Since the 2019 municipal election, the councillors of the plenum have the following political distribution: 14 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party, 5 seats for the Socialist Party of the Basque Country, 4 seats for the &lt;a href=\"EH%20Bildu\"&gt;EH Bildu&lt;/a&gt; coalition, 3 seats for Udalberri and 3 seats for the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor is &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Mari%20Aburto\"&gt;Juan Mari Aburto&lt;/a&gt;, chosen with 19 votes from the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist party.\nIn 2008 and 2010, Bilbao won the Municipal Transparency Prize, awarded by the Spanish division of &lt;a href=\"Transparency%20International\"&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009 it came second, after &lt;a href=\"Sant%20Cugat%20del%20Vall%C3%A9s\"&gt;Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistricts.\nThe municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: \"barrutia\") which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: \"auzoa\"). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and &lt;a href=\"elizate\"&gt;elizate&lt;/a&gt;s that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20la%20Vieja\"&gt;Bilbao la Vieja&lt;/a&gt;. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of &lt;a href=\"Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and the river side of &lt;a href=\"Uribarri\"&gt;Uribarri&lt;/a&gt;. In the 19th century the merge of &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt; into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Cobetas\"&gt;Mount Cobetas&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Errekalde\"&gt;Errekalde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basurto-Zorroza\"&gt;Basurto&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Bego\u00f1a and &lt;a href=\"Deusto\"&gt;Deusto&lt;/a&gt;. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of &lt;a href=\"slum\"&gt;slum&lt;/a&gt;s, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, &lt;a href=\"Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga\"&gt;Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga&lt;/a&gt; in the decade of 1990.\nEconomy.\nThe Bilbao metropolitan area comprises about 47% of the total population of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque autonomous community&lt;/a&gt;, out of which a 15% is registered in the municipality of Bilbao. The \"&lt;a href=\"Comarcas%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;comarca&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bilbao\"&gt;Greater Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, in which the city occupies a central position, has a &lt;a href=\"GDP%20per%20capita\"&gt;GDP per capita&lt;/a&gt; of \u20ac30,860, higher than the Spanish and European Union averages. The &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Bilbao metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20by%20GDP\"&gt;nominal GDP amounting to $36,9\u00a0billion&lt;/a&gt;. Bilbao has been the economic centre of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque autonomous community&lt;/a&gt; since the original establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Consulate%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Consulate of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in &lt;a href=\"Castile%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Castilian&lt;/a&gt; products on the town's &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;. It was in the 19th century when the city experimented its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and &lt;a href=\"siderurgy\"&gt;siderurgy&lt;/a&gt;, both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.\nBanking.\nBanking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: \"Banco de Bilbao\") in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: \"Banco de Vizcaya\") in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the &lt;a href=\"BBVA\"&gt;BBVA&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"savings%20bank\"&gt;savings bank&lt;/a&gt;s that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: \"Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao\") in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: \"Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya\") in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Bizkaia%20Kutxa\"&gt;Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa&lt;/a&gt; (BBK), which would marge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities (&lt;a href=\"Kutxa\"&gt;Kutxa&lt;/a&gt; and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form &lt;a href=\"Kutxabank\"&gt;Kutxabank&lt;/a&gt;. There is also the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao and the Stock Exchange Market of Bilbao, founded in 1890.\nPort.\nThe historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 19th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Abra\"&gt;the mouth&lt;/a&gt; of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of &lt;a href=\"Santurtzi\"&gt;Santurtzi&lt;/a&gt;. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called \"the super-port\", led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city, with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.\nThe port of Bilbao is a first-class commercial port and is among the top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the close of 2009 cargo movements amounted to 31.6\u00a0million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity contributed 419 million euros to the Basque GDP and maintains almost 10,000 jobs.\nMining and ironworks.\nIron is the main and most abundant &lt;a href=\"raw%20material\"&gt;raw material&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main &lt;a href=\"primary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;primary activity&lt;/a&gt; in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city's good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay. Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.\nTourism.\nThe first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Arenas\"&gt;Las Arenas&lt;/a&gt;, in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Getxo\"&gt;Getxo&lt;/a&gt; in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.\nThe real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the &lt;a href=\"Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao\"&gt;Guggenheim Museum Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018. The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists. Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking &lt;a href=\"San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Sebasti\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;. International travellers are predominantly French, crossing the border just to the east. The others arrive from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Tourism generates about 300 million euros yearly for the Biscayan GDP. Bilbao also draws &lt;a href=\"business%20tourism\"&gt;business tourism&lt;/a&gt;, having been equipped with facilities like the &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna%20Conference%20Centre%20and%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Exhibition%20Centre\"&gt;Bilbao Exhibition Centre&lt;/a&gt;, in nearby &lt;a href=\"Barakaldo\"&gt;Barakaldo&lt;/a&gt;.\nStock exchange.\nPlans to create a &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890. Bilbao's institution is one of the country's four regional stock exchanges, joining &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, Madrid, and &lt;a href=\"Valencia\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; as Spain's commercial centres. It is owned by &lt;a href=\"Bolsas%20y%20Mercados%20Espa%C3%B1oles\"&gt;Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles&lt;/a&gt;. The Bilbao Stock Exchange is considered a &lt;a href=\"secondary%20market\"&gt;secondary market&lt;/a&gt;.\nCityscape.\nUrban planning.\nIn its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (\"Somera\", \"Artecalle\", and \"Tender\u00eda\") surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small &lt;a href=\"hermitage%20%28religious%20retreat%29\"&gt;hermitage&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the Apostle &lt;a href=\"James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee\"&gt;Saint James&lt;/a&gt; (the current &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%27%20Cathedral%2C%20Bilbao\"&gt;St. James' Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;), which pilgrims visited on their &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20St.%20James\"&gt;way to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20de%20Compostela\"&gt;Santiago de Compostela&lt;/a&gt;. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original \"&lt;a href=\"Zazpikaleak\"&gt;Zazpikaleak&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Seven Streets\". In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.\nIn 1861, engineer Amado L\u00e1zaro projected an \"&lt;a href=\"ensanche\"&gt;ensanche&lt;/a&gt;\" inside the then-municipality of &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt; with wide avenues and regular buildings, that included the hygienists ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Eixample\"&gt;Eixample&lt;/a&gt;\", designed by &lt;a href=\"Ildefons%20Cerd%C3%A0\"&gt;Ildefons Cerd\u00e0&lt;/a&gt;. However, the project was dropped by the City Council after considering it \"utopian and excessive\" because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, L\u00e1zaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.\nThe next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital &lt;a href=\"annexation\"&gt;annexed&lt;/a&gt; (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new \"ensanche\" project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Ach\u00facarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike L\u00e1zaro's, this project was significantly smaller, compassing against the original . It also featured a not so strict &lt;a href=\"grid%20pattern\"&gt;grid pattern&lt;/a&gt;, a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the &lt;a href=\"Gran%20V%C3%ADa%20de%20Don%20Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Haro\"&gt;Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro&lt;/a&gt;, the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.\nBy 1925, the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Deusto\"&gt;Deusto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, as well as part of &lt;a href=\"Erandio\"&gt;Erandio&lt;/a&gt; were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Loiu\"&gt;Loiu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sondika\"&gt;Sondika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derio\"&gt;Derio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zamudio\"&gt;Zamudio&lt;/a&gt;. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with . However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a regained their independence on 1 January 1983.\nOn 18 May 2010, the government of Singapore awarded Bilbao the &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Kuan%20Yew\"&gt;Lee Kuan Yew&lt;/a&gt; World City Prize, at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Cities%20Summit\"&gt;World Cities Summit&lt;/a&gt; 2010. It is considered the &lt;a href=\"Pritzker%20Prize\"&gt;Pritzker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"urbanism\"&gt;urbanism&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nBilbao's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;gothic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Nouveau\"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neo-Gothic\"&gt;Neo-Gothic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20architecture\"&gt;contemporary architecture&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%27%20Cathedral%2C%20Bilbao\"&gt;St. James' Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20San%20Ant%C3%B3n\"&gt;Church of San Ant\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, included in the borough's coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a &lt;a href=\"pedestrian%20zone\"&gt;pedestrian zone&lt;/a&gt; during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the &lt;a href=\"Basilica%20of%20Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Basilica of Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to the patron saint of the province, &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town's boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the &lt;a href=\"Zubizuri\"&gt;Zubizuri&lt;/a&gt; (Basque for \"white bridge\"), a pedestrian &lt;a href=\"footbridge\"&gt;footbridge&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Calatrava\"&gt;Santiago Calatrava&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1997, and the &lt;a href=\"La%20Salve\"&gt;Princes of Spain Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"La Salve\", a &lt;a href=\"suspension%20bridge\"&gt;suspension bridge&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1972 and redesigned by French &lt;a href=\"concept%20art\"&gt;conceptual artist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Buren\"&gt;Daniel Buren&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The &lt;a href=\"Deusto%20Bridge\"&gt;Deusto Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"bascule%20bridge\"&gt;bascule bridge&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1936 and modelled after the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Avenue%20Bridge\"&gt;Michigan Avenue Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, in Chicago. Between 1890 and 1893 the first &lt;a href=\"transporter%20bridge\"&gt;transporter bridge&lt;/a&gt; (\"\"&lt;a href=\"Bizkaia%20Bridge\"&gt;Puente Colgante&lt;/a&gt;\"\") in the world on the &lt;a href=\"Nervion\"&gt;Nervion&lt;/a&gt; river, between &lt;a href=\"Portugalete\"&gt;Portugalete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Getxo\"&gt;Getxo&lt;/a&gt;, was built by &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Palacio\"&gt;Alberto Palacio&lt;/a&gt; (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.\nSince the deindustrialization process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world's most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the &lt;a href=\"Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao\"&gt;Guggenheim Museum&lt;/a&gt;, located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse. The building, designed by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gehry\"&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt; and inaugurated in October 1997, is considered among architecture experts as one of the most important structures of the last 30 years, and a masterpiece by itself. The museum houses part of the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Foundation\"&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation&lt;/a&gt; modern art collection. Another example is the &lt;a href=\"Azkuna%20Zentroa\"&gt;Azkuna Zentroa&lt;/a&gt;, a wine warehouse built in 1909 and completely redesigned in 2010 by French designer &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Starck\"&gt;Philippe Starck&lt;/a&gt; into a multi-purpose venue that consists of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, and a restaurant, among other spaces. The &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt;ibarra area is also being renovated, and it features not only the Guggenheim Museum, but also &lt;a href=\"Arata%20Isozaki\"&gt;Arata Isozaki&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Isozaki%20Atea\"&gt;tower complex&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna%20Conference%20Centre%20and%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iberdrola%20Tower\"&gt;Iberdrola Tower&lt;/a&gt;, designed by &lt;a href=\"Argentine\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Pelli\"&gt;C\u00e9sar Pelli&lt;/a&gt; which is, since its completion in 2011, the Basque Country's tallest skyscraper, high. &lt;a href=\"Zorrozaurre\"&gt;Zorrozaurre&lt;/a&gt; is the next area to be redeveloped, following a 2007 master plan designed by &lt;a href=\"Iraqi%20people\"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"Zaha%20Hadid\"&gt;Zaha Hadid&lt;/a&gt;. This peninsula was transformed into a island and will feature residential and commercial buildings, as well as the new &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Bizkaia%20Kutxa\"&gt;BBK&lt;/a&gt; seat.\nParks and gardens.\n, Bilbao has 18 &lt;a href=\"public%20parks\"&gt;public parks&lt;/a&gt; inside its limits, totalling of green spaces. Furthermore its &lt;a href=\"green%20belt\"&gt;green belt&lt;/a&gt; has a total area of , of which are urbanized. The largest parks are &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Cobetas\"&gt;Mount Cobetas&lt;/a&gt;, of , and Larreagaburu, of , both located on the outskirts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Do%C3%B1a%20Casilda%20Iturrizar%20park\"&gt;Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar park&lt;/a&gt; is located in the district of &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt;, near the town centre and covers an area of . It is named after a local benefactress who donated the grounds to the borough. It is an &lt;a href=\"English%20garden\"&gt;English-style garden&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Bastida\"&gt;Ricardo Bastida&lt;/a&gt; and opened to the public in 1907. It features a dancing water fountain surrounded by a &lt;a href=\"pergola\"&gt;pergola&lt;/a&gt;, and a pond with many species of ducks, geese and swans, which gives the park the alternate name of \"Ducks' Park\", as known locally. In recent years, it was expanded to be connected with the Abandoibarra area. In &lt;a href=\"Ibaiondo\"&gt;Ibaiondo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Etxeberria%20Park\"&gt;Etxeberria Park&lt;/a&gt; was built in the 1980s in the place where a steel mill previously stood. The original chimney was maintained as a homage of its industrial past. It covers an area of , on a sloped terrain that overlooks the Old Town. Other relevant public spaces inside the city include the &lt;a href=\"Europa%20Park%20%28Bilbao%29\"&gt;Europa Park&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Miribilla%20Park\"&gt;Miribilla Park&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Walkway\"&gt;Memorial Walkway&lt;/a&gt;, a long walkway, with high lamps, located in the left bank of the estuary and that connects the main sights.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Artxanda\"&gt;Mount Artxanda&lt;/a&gt; is easily accessible from the town centre by a &lt;a href=\"Artxanda%20Funicular\"&gt;funicular&lt;/a&gt;. There is a recreational area at the summit, with restaurants, a sports complex and a balcony with panoramic views. In the south, &lt;a href=\"Pagasarri\"&gt;Mount Pagasarri&lt;/a&gt; receives hundreds of &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hikers&lt;/a&gt; every weekend since the 1870s, who seek its natural wonders. Its environment is officially protected since 2007.\nCulture.\nBilbao was appointed a \"City of Design\" by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 and has been part of the &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Cities%20Network\"&gt;Creative Cities Network&lt;/a&gt; since then.\nTheaters.\nThe main hall of the city is the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Arriaga\"&gt;Arriaga Theater&lt;/a&gt;, reopened in 1985 as a municipal venue with a varied repertoire that includes dancing, opera, live music and theatre. Also very active are the Campos El\u00edseos Theater and the &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna%20Conference%20Centre%20and%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Euskalduna Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Other important venues include La Fundici\u00f3n, dedicated to contemporary dances and theatre; the Pabell\u00f3n 6, the Sala BBK and the &lt;a href=\"Azkuna%20Zentroa\"&gt;Azkuna Zentroa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuseums.\nBilbao has more than a dozen museums covering a range of fields including art, science, and sport, which have played a central role in Bilbao being named one of the most creative cities in the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao\"&gt;Guggenheim Museum Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Foundation\"&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, was inaugurated on 19 October 1997 and is work of the Canadian architect &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gehry\"&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt;. The museum's permanent collection is centered in the visual arts of the second half of the 20th century and the present, with relevant artworks from &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Serra\"&gt;Richard Serra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Koons\"&gt;Jeff Koons&lt;/a&gt;, although including as well temporary exhibitions with a more varied nature, like Russian art or engravings from &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer\"&gt;Albrecht D\u00fcrer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother important museum is the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Fine%20Arts%20Museum\"&gt;Bilbao Fine Arts Museum&lt;/a&gt;, first established in 1908 and housing a notable collection of Spanish and European work from the 12th century to present times. The collection from before the 20th century is centered mainly around Spanish and Flemish artists such as &lt;a href=\"El%20Greco\"&gt;El Greco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20de%20Zurbar%C3%A1n\"&gt;Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bartolom%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Murillo\"&gt;Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Goya\"&gt;Francisco Goya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20van%20Dyck\"&gt;Anthony van Dyck&lt;/a&gt;. The museum also holds one of the best collections of Basque art, with works from the 19th century to present times. It has an eye-catching collection of &lt;a href=\"Avant-garde\"&gt;Avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; art, from the Post-Impressionism of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gauguin\"&gt;Paul Gauguin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pop%20art\"&gt;Pop art&lt;/a&gt; and the expressionism of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Francis Bacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Basque Museum showcases Basque archaeology and ethnography, and holds frequent exhibitions in the area of Basque history. The museum building itself is part of the heritage listing \"&lt;a href=\"Conjunto%20hist%C3%B3rico\"&gt;Conjunto hist\u00f3rico&lt;/a&gt;\". The city also has several specialised museums, like the Maritime Museum Estuary of Bilbao (\"Bilboko Itsasadarra Itsas Museoa\"), located next to the &lt;a href=\"Estuary%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;Estuary of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, which holds ships and other collection related to the region's fishing and shipbuilding culture, being particularly relevant the \"Carola\" crane, last remaining element of the &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna\"&gt;Euskalduna&lt;/a&gt; shipyard that existed where the museum now stands.\nOther relevant museums are the Biscayan Archeological Museum (\"Arkeologi Museoa\") which holds important collections related to the region's prehistory, and the Diocesan Museum of Religious Art (\"Eleiz Museoa\"), both located in the &lt;a href=\"Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Casco Viejo&lt;/a&gt; quarter.\nMusic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Euskalduna%20Conference%20Centre%20and%20Concert%20Hall\"&gt;Euskalduna Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt; is home to frequent musical performances and it is home of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (\"&lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Orkestra%20Sinfonikoa\"&gt;Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa&lt;/a&gt;\") and the opera season programmed by the ABAO (Bilbao Association of Friends of the Opera). The Arriaga Theater is frequently the host of numerous musical events, other notable stages include the Philharmonic Society of Bilbao (chamber music) and Bilborock (pop and rock music). The city hosts many different musical festivities, often funded by the city hall. Due to its scope, it is especially relevant the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20BBK%20Live\"&gt;Bilbao BBK Live&lt;/a&gt; festival, which has been celebrated every year since 2006 and focuses on Basque, Spanish and international pop and rock music. Since the opening of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%282013%29\"&gt;new San Mam\u00e9s Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, it has been often used as an open-air concert venue, the first ever concert being one from the American band &lt;a href=\"Guns%20N%27Roses\"&gt;Guns N'Roses&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Other relevant music festivals include the \"Bilbao Distrito Jazz\" and the \"Bilbao Ars Sacrum\", the latter dedicated to &lt;a href=\"religious%20music\"&gt;religious music&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilbao is the birthplace of famous composer &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cris%C3%B3stomo%20Arriaga\"&gt;Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga&lt;/a&gt;, who lived his formative years in the city before moving to Paris at age 15.

Important musical bands coming from the city include rock band \"&lt;a href=\"Fito%20%26amp%3B%20Fitipaldis\"&gt;Fito &amp; Fitipaldis&lt;/a&gt;\", Basque &lt;a href=\"Folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt; band \"&lt;a href=\"Oskorri\"&gt;Oskorri&lt;/a&gt;\" and folk-pop band \"&lt;a href=\"Mocedades\"&gt;Mocedades&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBilbao hosted the &lt;a href=\"2018%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;2018 MTV Europe Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nFestivals and events.\nBilbao hosts several regular festivals and events. The most relevant is the Big Week of the city (\"&lt;a href=\"Aste%20Nagusia\"&gt;Aste Nagusia&lt;/a&gt;\"), celebrated annually since 1978 and lasting nine days. It is the city's main festival, attracting over 1,500,000 people every year. The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, &lt;a href=\"Basque%20rural%20sports\"&gt;Basque rural sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish-style%20bullfighting\"&gt;bullfighting&lt;/a&gt;, as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the \"chupinazo\" or \"txupinazo\", which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities' herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the \"txosnas\", where the different \"&lt;a href=\"Comparsa\"&gt;konpartsak&lt;/a&gt;\" are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is \"Marijaia\", a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.\nBeyond the main festivities of the \"Aste Nagusia\", the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Saint Agatha&lt;/a&gt; on 5 February, the celebrations of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Bego%C3%B1a\"&gt;Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; on 11 October, the Day of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Thomas the Apostle&lt;/a&gt; on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centered around the figure of &lt;a href=\"Olentzero\"&gt;Olentzero&lt;/a&gt;. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the \"Fiestas del Carmen\" in Santutxu and Indautxu, \"Fiestas Santiago\" in Bilbao la Vieja, \"Fiestas San Ignacio\" in San Inazio and \"Fiestas San Roque\" in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.\nThe city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centered exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.\nCuisine.\nTraditional Bilbao dishes are centered around products from the sea and the estuary, such as &lt;a href=\"European%20eel\"&gt;eels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, including dishes such as \"bacalao al pil pil\" (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), \"bacalao a la vizca\u00edna\" (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of \"choricero\" peppers and onions), \"merluza en salsa verde\" (hake fish with &lt;a href=\"green%20sauce\"&gt;green sauce&lt;/a&gt;), \"chipirones en su tinta\" (&lt;a href=\"Squid%20as%20food\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; served with &lt;a href=\"Cephalopod%20ink\"&gt;its own ink&lt;/a&gt;), \"morros a la vizca\u00edna\" (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), \"revuelto de perretxikos\" (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as \"canutillos de Bilbao\" (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), \"&lt;a href=\"Pantxineta\"&gt;Pantxineta&lt;/a&gt;\" (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), &lt;a href=\"rice%20cake\"&gt;rice cake&lt;/a&gt;s and \"bollos de mantequilla\" (butter buns).\nBilbao, as other &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the \"&lt;a href=\"Pincho\"&gt;pintxos&lt;/a&gt;\", which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include \"rabas\" (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20omelette\"&gt;Spanish omelette&lt;/a&gt; (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), \"\" (stuffed mushrooms), \"tri\u00e1ngulos\" (Bilbao-style sandwiches), \"gildas\" (one or more olives, a \"guindilla\" pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).\nIn what refers to beverages, typical from the region is the \"&lt;a href=\"txakoli\"&gt;txakoli&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"white%20wine\"&gt;white wine&lt;/a&gt; usually drunk as an &lt;a href=\"Ap%C3%A9ritif%20and%20digestif\"&gt;ap\u00e9ritif&lt;/a&gt;. Biscayan \"txakoli\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Bizkaiko%20Txakolina\"&gt;Bizkaiko Txakolina&lt;/a&gt;\") is a protected \"&lt;a href=\"Denominaci%C3%B3n%20de%20origen\"&gt;Denominaci\u00f3n de origen&lt;/a&gt;\" for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are &lt;a href=\"cider\"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"patxaran\"&gt;patxaran&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"sloe\"&gt;sloe&lt;/a&gt;-flavoured liqueur) and &lt;a href=\"Rioja%20%28wine%29\"&gt;\"Rioja\" wine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the &lt;a href=\"Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Casco Viejo&lt;/a&gt; quarter. \"&lt;a href=\"Txoko\"&gt;Txoko&lt;/a&gt;s\" are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.\nLanguage.\nThe Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque language&lt;/a&gt;, which is vernacular to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as &lt;a href=\"Bermeo\"&gt;Bermeo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lekeitio\"&gt;Lekeitio&lt;/a&gt;. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a number of 37% in 2001. More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Bego\u00f1a and Abando.\nAccording to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.\nTransport.\nRoads and highways.\nBilbao is a relevant transport hub for northern Spain. Bilbao is connected to three major motorways and a series of minor roads of national and provincial level. The city lies on two international roads, the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E70\"&gt;European route E70&lt;/a&gt; that follows the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt; and the cities of &lt;a href=\"Santander%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Santander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gij%C3%B3n\"&gt;Gij\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; to the west and with &lt;a href=\"Eibar\"&gt;Eibar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Sebasti\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E80\"&gt;European route E80&lt;/a&gt; connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including &lt;a href=\"Burgos\"&gt;Burgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salamanca\"&gt;Salamanca&lt;/a&gt; and continuing to &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Toulouse\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; to the north. The &lt;a href=\"Autopista%20AP-68\"&gt;AP-68&lt;/a&gt; motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with &lt;a href=\"Vitoria-Gasteiz\"&gt;Vitoria-Gasteiz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Logro%C3%B1o\"&gt;Logro\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; and ending in &lt;a href=\"Zaragoza\"&gt;Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city is connected with the regions of &lt;a href=\"Cantabria\"&gt;Cantabria&lt;/a&gt;, Asturias and &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Autov%C3%ADa%20A-8\"&gt;A-8&lt;/a&gt; motorway and with &lt;a href=\"Durango%2C%20Biscay\"&gt;Durango&lt;/a&gt;, Eibar, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border via the &lt;a href=\"Autopista%20AP-8\"&gt;AP-8&lt;/a&gt; motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20de%20Ebro\"&gt;Miranda de Ebro&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Autov%C3%ADa%20A-1\"&gt;A-1&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and in Zaragoza with the &lt;a href=\"Autopista%20AP-2\"&gt;AP-2&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road &lt;a href=\"N-634%20road%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;N-634&lt;/a&gt; which connects San Sebasti\u00e1n with &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20de%20Compostela\"&gt;Santiago de Compostela&lt;/a&gt; and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with &lt;a href=\"Bermeo\"&gt;Bermeo&lt;/a&gt;, while the BI-626 joins the city with &lt;a href=\"Balmaseda\"&gt;Balmaseda&lt;/a&gt;. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.\nThe city's main arteries the &lt;a href=\"Gran%20V%C3%ADa%20de%20Don%20Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Haro\"&gt;Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro&lt;/a&gt;, which crosses the financial and business district of &lt;a href=\"Abando\"&gt;Abando&lt;/a&gt; and connecting it with the &lt;a href=\"Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Casco Viejo&lt;/a&gt; to the east and the San Mam\u00e9s area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonom\u00eda Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the &lt;a href=\"Estuary%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;Estuary of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cadagua\"&gt;Kadagua&lt;/a&gt; river, including the &lt;a href=\"La%20Salve\"&gt;La Salve&lt;/a&gt; and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Artxanda\"&gt;Mount Artxanda&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirports.\nBilbao is served by the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Airport\"&gt;Bilbao Airport&lt;/a&gt; (BIO), the busiest terminal in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4\u00a0million passengers in 2018. It is located north of the borough, between the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Loiu\"&gt;Loiu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sondika\"&gt;Sondika&lt;/a&gt;. 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including &lt;a href=\"Iberia\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa\"&gt;Lufthansa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"TAP%20Portugal\"&gt;TAP Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. Top destinations include London, Frankfurt, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, M\u00e1laga, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. It opened to the public in September 1948, with a regular flight to Madrid. On 19 November 2000, a new terminal building was opened, designed by Valencian architect &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Calatrava\"&gt;Santiago Calatrava&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2009, a project was approved to expand the current building to double its capacity. Although originally expected to be completed by 2014, the &lt;a href=\"Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008\"&gt;financial crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the decrease of passenger traffic delayed it to at least 2019. No work has begun as of 2018.\nSome low-cost airlines, such as &lt;a href=\"Ryanair\"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, also use the &lt;a href=\"Vitoria%20Airport\"&gt;Vitoria Airport&lt;/a&gt; (VIT) located in &lt;a href=\"Foronda\"&gt;Foronda&lt;/a&gt; located 59\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) south of the city.\nRailways.\nLong-distance rail lines connect Bilbao with Madrid, Barcelona and other destinations in northern Spain. The city has four railway stations: the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao-Abando%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bilbao-Abando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Concordia\"&gt;Bilbao-Concordia&lt;/a&gt; railway stations are owned by &lt;a href=\"Adif\"&gt;Adif&lt;/a&gt; and operated by the Spanish railways &lt;a href=\"Renfe%20Operadora\"&gt;Renfe&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao-Atxuri%20Station\"&gt;Bilbao-Atxuri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zazpikaleak/Casco%20Viejo\"&gt;Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo&lt;/a&gt; stations are owned by the Basque railway network ETS and operated by &lt;a href=\"Euskotren\"&gt;Euskotren&lt;/a&gt;, serving short-distance local destinations.\nThe Bilbao-Abando station is the main railway station of the city, with Renfe running &lt;a href=\"Iberian-gauge%20railways\"&gt;Iberian-gauge&lt;/a&gt; long-distance &lt;a href=\"Alvia\"&gt;Alvia&lt;/a&gt; trains to &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Intercity services to &lt;a href=\"Vigo\"&gt;Vigo&lt;/a&gt; with connections possible to &lt;a href=\"A%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;A Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hendaye\"&gt;Hendaye&lt;/a&gt;. During the summer there are special trains to &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1laga\"&gt;M\u00e1laga&lt;/a&gt;. The city will be connected to the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Y\"&gt;Basque Y&lt;/a&gt; high-speed train network around 2023, allowing for high speed &lt;a href=\"AVE\"&gt;AVE&lt;/a&gt; trains to operate between the Basque capitals and also to Madrid and other Spanish cities in the future. The arrival of the new high speed services will involve the creation of a completely new underground station that will replace the current infrastructure. The construction is expected to begin in 2020.\nBilbao-Concordia station is located in close vicinity to Bilbao-Abando, and hosts the &lt;a href=\"narrow-gauge%20railway\"&gt;narrow-gauge railway&lt;/a&gt; services ran by Renfe under the &lt;a href=\"Renfe%20Feve\"&gt;Renfe Feve&lt;/a&gt; brand. Renfe runs frequent regional trains to the cities of &lt;a href=\"Santander%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Santander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Le%C3%B3n%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Euskotren%20Trena\"&gt;Euskotren Trena&lt;/a&gt; runs regular services to &lt;a href=\"Bermeo\"&gt;Bermeo&lt;/a&gt; from the Bilbao-Atxuri station, while in the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station there are regional services to Durango, Eibar and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nPublic transport.\nPublic transport by rail and bus is organised by the \"Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa\" (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the &lt;a href=\"Barik%20card\"&gt;Barik card&lt;/a&gt;, a form of &lt;a href=\"electronic%20ticket\"&gt;electronic ticket&lt;/a&gt; valid across almost all public transport systems of the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Bilbao metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt; province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.\nThe mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Bilbao\"&gt;Metro Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections (&lt;a href=\"Line%201%20%28Metro%20Bilbao%29\"&gt;Line 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Line%202%20%28Metro%20Bilbao%29\"&gt;Line 2&lt;/a&gt;). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in &lt;a href=\"Etxebarri\"&gt;Etxebarri&lt;/a&gt; in the south all the way to &lt;a href=\"Plentzia\"&gt;Plentzia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santurtzi\"&gt;Santurtzi&lt;/a&gt; by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and since has been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Foster\"&gt;Norman Foster&lt;/a&gt;. Line 3 of metro is operated by &lt;a href=\"Euskotren%20Trena\"&gt;Euskotren Trena&lt;/a&gt;, which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with &lt;a href=\"Lezama\"&gt;Lezama&lt;/a&gt; and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.\nEuskotren also operates a &lt;a href=\"Bilbao%20tram\"&gt;tramway line&lt;/a&gt; under the brand &lt;a href=\"Euskotren%20Tranbia\"&gt;Euskotren Tranbia&lt;/a&gt;. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao-Atxuri%20Station\"&gt;Bilbao-Atxuri Station&lt;/a&gt; and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mam\u00e9s football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.\n&lt;a href=\"Renfe%20Operadora\"&gt;Renfe&lt;/a&gt; operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro. Three of them operate under the &lt;a href=\"Cercan%C3%ADas\"&gt;Cercan\u00edas&lt;/a&gt; brand and are collectively known as \"&lt;a href=\"Cercan%C3%ADas%20Bilbao\"&gt;Cercan\u00edas Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;\", while a fourth line is operated by Renfe Feve. The three lines operated under the Cercan\u00edas name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as &lt;a href=\"Muskiz\"&gt;Muskiz&lt;/a&gt; or even outside of the Biscay province, like &lt;a href=\"Amurrio\"&gt;Amurrio&lt;/a&gt;. The three lines all start in the &lt;a href=\"Bilbao-Abando%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bilbao-Abando railway station&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the line operated by Renfe Feve starts in the Bilbao-Concordia station.\nThe gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand &lt;a href=\"Bilbobus\"&gt;Bilbobus&lt;/a&gt; and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as \"Gautxori\" (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The &lt;a href=\"BizkaiBus\"&gt;BizkaiBus&lt;/a&gt; network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt; and some in &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lava\"&gt;\u00c1lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Brittany%20Ferries\"&gt;Brittany Ferries&lt;/a&gt; ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; (UK). &lt;a href=\"MV%20Cap%20Finist%C3%A8re\"&gt;MV Cap Finist\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; ferry departs from the &lt;a href=\"port%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;port of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, north west of the town centre. A service operated by &lt;a href=\"Trasmediterranea\"&gt;Acciona Trasmediterranea&lt;/a&gt; served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. &lt;a href=\"P%26amp%3BO%20Ferries\"&gt;P&amp;O Ferries&lt;/a&gt; operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20Bilbao\"&gt;Pride of Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 minutes. Three percent of public transit passengers ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 minutes, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 10% travel more than in a single direction.\nInfrastructure.\nHealthcare.\nThe public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (\"&lt;a href=\"Osakidetza\"&gt;Osakidetza&lt;/a&gt;\"), which has a network of medican centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the &lt;a href=\"Basurto-Zorroza\"&gt;Basurto-Zorroza&lt;/a&gt; district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century. Its design was based on the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20Hamburg-Eppendorf\"&gt;Eppendorf Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, in (Germany), one of the most modern at the time. In 2008 the hospital was named the best hospital in customer support in Spain.\nHowever, the two largest hospitals that provide healthcare services to the inhabitants of the city are located outside of the city limits: the University Hospital of Gurutzeta/Cruces in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Barakaldo\"&gt;Barakaldo&lt;/a&gt; and the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in &lt;a href=\"Galdakao\"&gt;Galdakao&lt;/a&gt;. Other minor public hospitals located in the city include the Santa Marina Hospital and the Hospital of Urduliz, located in the metropolitan area.\nUtilities.\nThe headquarters of \"&lt;a href=\"Iberdrola\"&gt;Iberdrola&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"multinational%20corporation\"&gt;multinational&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"electric%20utility\"&gt;electric utility&lt;/a&gt; company are located in Bilbao. The company was created in 1992 after the merging of \"Iberduero\" and \"Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola\" and it is in charge of production and distribution of electricity. There are two &lt;a href=\"thermal%20power%20station\"&gt;thermal power station&lt;/a&gt;s located in the city's surroundings, one in &lt;a href=\"Santurtzi\"&gt;Santurtzi&lt;/a&gt; and the other in &lt;a href=\"Zierbena\"&gt;Zierbena&lt;/a&gt;. The electricity produced in both these stations is then transferred to the &lt;a href=\"electrical%20substation\"&gt;electrical substation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCe%C3%B1es\"&gt;G\u00fce\u00f1es&lt;/a&gt; by the company \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20El%C3%A9ctrica%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;\", which is the company responsible of moving electricity from the production stations to the final consumers. There is a &lt;a href=\"combined%20cycle\"&gt;combined cycle&lt;/a&gt; power station in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Amorebieta-Etxano\"&gt;Amorebieta&lt;/a&gt; called \"Bizkaia Energia\", whose energy is transferred to the substation of &lt;a href=\"Gatika\"&gt;Gatika&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe supply of all oil-based fuels distributed in the whole metropolitan area (gasoline, &lt;a href=\"diesel%20fuel\"&gt;diesel fuel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"butane\"&gt;butane&lt;/a&gt;) are produced in the &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; owned by \"&lt;a href=\"Petronor\"&gt;Petronor&lt;/a&gt;\" in the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Muskiz\"&gt;Muskiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abanto%20y%20Ci%C3%A9rbana-Abanto%20Zierbena\"&gt;Abanto Zierbena&lt;/a&gt;. \"Petronor\" is a large oil company founded in Bilbao in 1968 and it currently comprises two partners, &lt;a href=\"Repsol\"&gt;Repsol&lt;/a&gt; (85.98%) and &lt;a href=\"Kutxabank\"&gt;Kutxabank&lt;/a&gt; (14.02%).\nSupply of &lt;a href=\"drinking%20water\"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; is managed by the \"Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia\" (Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium), a public entity with the responsibility of managing the water infrastructure and distribution to many Biscayan municipalities, Bilbao and its metropolitan area included. The supply of drinking water for the city comes from the &lt;a href=\"Reservoir%20of%20Ull%C3%ADbarri-Gamboa\"&gt;Uribarri-Ganboa&lt;/a&gt; and Urrunaga reservoirs, which are fed by the river &lt;a href=\"Zadorra\"&gt;Zadorra&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nThe Basque Country has a bilingual education system, with students able to choose between four linguistic models: A, B, D, and X, which differ in the prevalence of Basque or Spanish as the spoken and written language used in classes. In Bilbao, there is a prevalence of model D (where Basque is the vehicle language and Spanish is taught as a subject) in &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Spain%23Primary%20school\"&gt;Primary School&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Spain%23Compulsory%20Secondary%20Education%20%28ESO%29\"&gt;Compulsory Secondary Education&lt;/a&gt; students favour model B (where some subjects are in Basque and other in Spanish). Finally, 67% of &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Spain%23Spanish%20Baccalaureate%20%28Bachillerato%29\"&gt;Baccalaureate&lt;/a&gt; students choose model A (in which Spanish is the vehicle language and Basque is a subject). English is the most widespread foreign language taught, being the option for 97% of pre-university students.\nHigher education.\nTwo universities are seated in Bilbao. The older is the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Deusto\"&gt;University of Deusto&lt;/a&gt;, founded by the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. It took its name from the then independent municipality of &lt;a href=\"Deusto\"&gt;Deusto&lt;/a&gt;, annexed to Bilbao in 1925. It was the only higher education institute in the borough until the establishment in 1968 of the University of Bilbao, later to become the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country\"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; in 1980. This public university, which has a presence in the three provinces of the autonomous community, has its main Biscayan campus in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Leioa\"&gt;Leioa&lt;/a&gt;, although the Technical and Business faculties are based in Bilbao. Since 2014, &lt;a href=\"Mondragon%20University\"&gt;Mondragon University&lt;/a&gt; has also a presence in the city through the innovation and entrepreneurial centre Bilbao Innovation Factory. In 2015, the offer of higher education in the city was expanded with the foundation of Dantzerti, the Higher School of Dramatic Arts and Dance of the Basque Country.\nSport.\nAs in the rest of Spain, &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular competitive sport, followed by &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Bilbao offers many outdoor activities owing to its location by the sea amid the hilly countryside. &lt;a href=\"Hiking\"&gt;Hiking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rock%20climbing\"&gt;rock climbing&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby mountains are very popular. &lt;a href=\"Watersports\"&gt;Watersports&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"surfing\"&gt;surfing&lt;/a&gt;, are practised on the beaches of nearby &lt;a href=\"Sopelana\"&gt;Sopelana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundaka\"&gt;Mundaka&lt;/a&gt;.\nClubs.\nThe main football club is Athletic Club, commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao\"&gt;Athletic Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; in English. It plays at the new &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%282013%29\"&gt;San Mam\u00e9s stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 2013 and seats 53,332 spectators.\nAthletic Bilbao was one of the founding members of the Spanish football league, &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt;, and has played in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n (First Division) ever since \u2013 winning it on eight occasions.
