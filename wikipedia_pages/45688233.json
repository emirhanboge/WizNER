    "text": "Perak Malay (&lt;a href=\"Standard%20Malay\"&gt;Standard Malay&lt;/a&gt;: \"Bahasa Melayu Perak\"; &lt;a href=\"Jawi%20script\"&gt;Jawi script&lt;/a&gt;: \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0648 \u06a4\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0642) is one of the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20languages\"&gt;dialects&lt;/a&gt; spoken within the state of &lt;a href=\"Perak\"&gt;Perak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is neither the official language nor the standard dialect in the whole state of Perak, its existence which co-exists with other major dialects in the state of Perak still plays an important role in maintaining the identity of Perak. In spite of the fact that there are five main dialects traditionally spoken in Perak, only one of which is intended by the name \"Perak Malay\". There are subtle &lt;a href=\"phonetic\"&gt;phonetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syntax\"&gt;syntactic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lexicon\"&gt;lexical&lt;/a&gt; distinctions from other major Malay dialects. Perak Malay can be divided into two sub-dialects, &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Kangsar\"&gt;Kuala Kangsar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perak%20Tengah\"&gt;Perak Tengah&lt;/a&gt;, named after the \"&lt;a href=\"daerah\"&gt;daerah&lt;/a&gt;\" (districts) where they are predominantly spoken.\nClassification.\nLinguistically, the Malay dialects spoken in the state of Perak are diverse. In fact, there is still no definite classification of the type of Malay dialects used in Perak. Ismail Hussein (1973) classified the Malay dialects in Perak into five types &lt;a href=\"Geographical%20segregation\"&gt;segregated&lt;/a&gt; into five different areas. While Harun Mat Piah (1983) categorized them into six. Although Asmah Haji Omar (1985) divided the Malay dialects in Perak into five types, the specifications of the division did not coincide with that of Ismail's.\nDistribution.\nPerak Malay is spoken throughout the whole state except in the northwestern parts of Perak (&lt;a href=\"Kerian\"&gt;Kerian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larut%2C%20Matang%20and%20Selama\"&gt;Larut, Matang and Selama&lt;/a&gt;), and a few parts of &lt;a href=\"Manjung\"&gt;Manjung&lt;/a&gt; district including &lt;a href=\"Pangkor%20Island\"&gt;Pangkor Island&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Kedah%20Malay\"&gt;northern dialect&lt;/a&gt; is predominantly spoken.\nIn the northeastern part of Perak (&lt;a href=\"Hulu%20Perak\"&gt;Hulu Perak&lt;/a&gt;) and some parts of &lt;a href=\"Larut%2C%20Matang%20and%20Selama\"&gt;Selama&lt;/a&gt; and Kerian, the Malay people natively speak a distinct variant of Malay language which is most closely related to &lt;a href=\"Kelantan-Pattani%20Malay\"&gt;Kelantan-Pattani Malay&lt;/a&gt; and the Malay dialects of &lt;a href=\"southern%20Thailand\"&gt;southern Thailand&lt;/a&gt; due to geographical borders and historical assimilation. This variant is occasionally classified as a sub-dialect of &lt;a href=\"Yawi%20language\"&gt;Yawi&lt;/a&gt;. The district of Hulu Perak once was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Reman\"&gt;Kingdom of Reman&lt;/a&gt;. Reman was historically a part of &lt;a href=\"Pattani%20%28region%29\"&gt;Greater Pattani&lt;/a&gt; (which is now a &lt;a href=\"Pattani%20Province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;) before gaining independence in 1810 from the &lt;a href=\"Pattani%20Kingdom\"&gt;Pattani Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; via a rebellion by the Royal Family.\nIn the southern parts of Perak (&lt;a href=\"Hilir%20Perak\"&gt;Hilir Perak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Batang%20Padang\"&gt;Batang Padang&lt;/a&gt;) and also in the districts of &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20District\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kinta%20District\"&gt;Kinta&lt;/a&gt; and several parts of Manjung, the dialect is heavily influenced by southern Malay dialects of the peninsula such as &lt;a href=\"Selangor\"&gt;Selangor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20language\"&gt;Johore-Riau Malay&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;languages of Indonesian archipelago&lt;/a&gt; namely &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20language\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banjar%20language\"&gt;Banjar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rawa%20%28tribe%29%23Dialect\"&gt;Rawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandailing%20language\"&gt;Mandailing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buginese%20language\"&gt;Buginese&lt;/a&gt; as a result of historical immigration, &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Klang%20War\"&gt;Klang War&lt;/a&gt; and other inevitable factors.\nWhilst there are many Malay dialects significantly found in Perak, all Malay &lt;a href=\"dialectologist\"&gt;dialectologist&lt;/a&gt;s basically agreed that Perak Malay is spoken by the native &lt;a href=\"Malay%20people\"&gt;Malay people&lt;/a&gt; who traditionally have long been subsisting along the riverine system of Perak which comprises &lt;a href=\"Perak%20River\"&gt;Perak River&lt;/a&gt; valley and its vicinity except those at the &lt;a href=\"Hulu%20Perak\"&gt;upper stream&lt;/a&gt;. Historically, it was a tradition for the Malay &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s in Perak to settle along the Perak River. Royal residences also were built at various sites along the &lt;a href=\"river%20basin\"&gt;river basin&lt;/a&gt;, and there was never any attempt to move to another tributary.\nCharacteristics.\nPhonology.\nOpen final syllables.\nIt has been said that in general, the Malay people in &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Peninsula\"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt; distinguish the dialect of Perak by the final vowel in &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Malay\"&gt;Standard Malay&lt;/a&gt; substituted into strong 'e': , in contrast to , , and in the other Malay dialects, similar to inland &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20Malay\"&gt;Terengganu dialect&lt;/a&gt;. So as for the word (eye) which is shown by the phonemes in Standard Malay, is pronounced as in Perak Malay notably in central Perak region. It appears that Perak Malay has a vowel raising rule which changes word final vowel of Standard Malay to .\nException of this rule occurs for some words as shown in the table below. This exception is regarded as common amongst most Malay dialects in the peninsula.\nAs the prevalence of Perak Malay, the diphthongs presented by the graphemes and are often articulated as varied forms of &lt;a href=\"monophthongs\"&gt;monophthongs&lt;/a&gt;. Still and all, diphthongization of monophthongs occurs in certain conditions instead. For instance, the final vowels sound /-i/ and /-u/ are articulated to some extent as diphthongs [-iy] and [-uw] respectively. The &lt;a href=\"monophthongization\"&gt;monophthongization&lt;/a&gt; patterns phonetically vary by the sub-dialects.\nThe pattern /-ai\u032f/ transformed to [-a\u02d0] is particularly restricted to some areas within the district of Perak Tengah. Typically in most villages in &lt;a href=\"Parit\"&gt;Parit&lt;/a&gt; and southward to &lt;a href=\"Bota\"&gt;Bota&lt;/a&gt;, this pattern is applied. While in the sub-districts of &lt;a href=\"Kampung%20Gajah\"&gt;Kampung Gajah&lt;/a&gt; and northward to Lambor, the speakers tend to utter in the similar form as in Kuala Kangsar sub-dialect.\nClosed final syllables.\nThere is a phonological rule in Perak Malay that &lt;a href=\"Neutralization%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;neutralizes&lt;/a&gt; the final &lt;a href=\"nasal%20consonant\"&gt;nasals&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"alveolar%20nasal\"&gt;alveolar nasal&lt;/a&gt;. The final nasals and phonetically exist in certain environments. In other circumstances, the nasals are neutralized to . This neutralizing rule operates only if the final nasals are directly preceded by or . In addition, the and are &lt;a href=\"allophones\"&gt;allophones&lt;/a&gt; of and in closed final syllables in general &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20language\"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malay%20phonology\"&gt;phonology&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhoticity.\nMost of Malay dialects particularly in Malaysia are &lt;a href=\"non-rhotic\"&gt;non-rhotic&lt;/a&gt;. Perak Malay is one of non-rhotic variants of Malay language and the 'r' is guttural. In Perak Malay, if the 'r' appears in the initial and middle position of a word, it will be pronounced as French 'r' specifically &lt;a href=\"voiced%20uvular%20fricative\"&gt;voiced uvular fricative&lt;/a&gt;, [\u0281] but if it comes in the final position of a word and in a postvocalic setting, it will be dropped or deleted and then substituted into an open vowel; usually 'o' by affecting the open vowel preceding it.\nVocabulary.\nPersonal pronouns.\nPerak Malay differs lexically from Standard Malay for some personal pronouns. The suffix\" '-me' \"indicates plural pronoun. Possibly\" '-me' \"is derived from the word that means 'all' in Malay.\n\"Notes:\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"* Kuala Kangsar variant\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"** Influence of the &lt;a href=\"Kedah%20Malay\"&gt;northern dialect&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIntensifiers.\nInstead of using \" or \" as intensifier for an adjective, Perak Malay speakers also use specific intensifiers for some adjectives.\nAnimals.\nPerak Malay also differs phonetically and lexically from Standard Malay for some animals.\nFruits and plants.\nPerak Malay has distinct names for specific fruits and plants. Some differ in pronunciation from Standard Malay."
