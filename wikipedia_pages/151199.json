Today, Longview is considered a major hub city for the region, as is the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Tyler%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, \"&lt;a href=\"Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine ranked Longview as the sixth fastest-growing small city in the United States. Companies with significant presence in Longview are &lt;a href=\"Eastman%20Chemical%20Company\"&gt;Eastman Chemical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Industries\"&gt;Trinity Rail Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AAON\"&gt;AAON Coil Products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Komatsu%20Limited\"&gt;Komatsu Mining&lt;/a&gt;.

Later that year, he sold another for $500 in gold. He hoped the coming of the railroad would increase the value of the rest of his land.\nMethvin coined the name of the town when he stated, \"What a long view!\" from his home. In June 1871, Longview was incorporated as the first town in Gregg County.\nIn 1884 the &lt;a href=\"Mobberly%20Hotel\"&gt;Mobberly Hotel&lt;/a&gt; opened for business servicing railroad travelers and served as the center of social gatherings for Longview. The hotel featured cherry wood furniture with carved bed posts, marble top washstand, linen table cloths, electric crystal chandeliers and a fireplace in every room. Mobberly was located in the junction part of town near the train depot. The hotel was destroyed by fire on June 13, 1965.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Longview%20race%20riot\"&gt;Longview race riot&lt;/a&gt; in July 1919, a reporter for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chicago%20Defender\"&gt;The Chicago Defender&lt;/a&gt;\" was in Longview looking into the mysterious death of a black man named Lemuel Walters. An armed white mob attacked a home where the reporter, S.L. Jones, was staying and attempted to batter their way in. A gunfight began between the attackers and the men in the house. Eventually, Jones made a getaway. The white men then began to burn buildings in the black section of the town.\nIn 1942, construction began on the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Inch\"&gt;Big Inch&lt;/a&gt; pipeline in Longview. From 1943 to 1945, the pipeline transported over 261,000,000 barrels of crude oil to the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;East Coast&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of construction, Big Inch and its smaller twin, Little Inch, comprised the longest petroleum pipeline ever built in the world. Both were integral in supplying the United States war effort in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter World War II Longview's population grew from 24,502 to 40,050 in 1960, its growth fueled by migration from rural Gregg County and the annexation of &lt;a href=\"Greggton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Greggton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Hill%2C%20Gregg%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Spring Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLongview is bordered to the west by the city of &lt;a href=\"White%20Oak%2C%20Texas\"&gt;White Oak&lt;/a&gt; and is surrounded by a number of smaller cities and towns, including &lt;a href=\"Kilgore%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Kilgore&lt;/a&gt; (southwest), &lt;a href=\"Gladewater%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Gladewater&lt;/a&gt; (west), &lt;a href=\"Gilmer%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Gilmer&lt;/a&gt; (northwest), &lt;a href=\"Ore%20City%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Ore City&lt;/a&gt; (north), &lt;a href=\"Harleton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Harleton&lt;/a&gt; (northeast), &lt;a href=\"Hallsville%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Hallsville&lt;/a&gt; (east), and &lt;a href=\"Lakeport%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Lakeport&lt;/a&gt; (southeast). \nSituated west-southwest of Longview, &lt;a href=\"Tyler%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt; is another regional hub city of comparable size.\nIncorporated areas include Spring Hill, Pine Tree, Judson, and Longview Heights.\nClimate.\nLongview has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt;.
