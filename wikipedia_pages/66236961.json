    "text": "William Smith Cameron (2 December 1883 \u2013 14 October 1958) was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; whose position was mainly as an &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Inside%20forward\"&gt;inside forward&lt;/a&gt;, though he was versatile and also played in the &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre-forward\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Outside%20forward\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Wing%20half\"&gt;half back&lt;/a&gt; during his career.\nPlaying career.\nCameron's playing career, during which he acquired the nickname 'Kilty', was largely characterised by short periods at several clubs in northern England and south-west Scotland. Born at &lt;a href=\"Mossend\"&gt;Mossend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanarkshire\"&gt;Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt;, though much of his early life was spent in &lt;a href=\"Coatbridge\"&gt;Coatbridge&lt;/a&gt; where his father worked in the local ironworks, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; owing to that town's connections to heavy industry, having initially moved south to play for &lt;a href=\"Glossop%20North%20End%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Glossop&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis longest spell was at &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;five seasons&lt;/a&gt; and was part of the squad that won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; championship in &lt;a href=\"1911%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League\"&gt;1911\u201312&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the likes of fellow Scots &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Aitkenhead\"&gt;Walter Aitkenhead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Orr%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Johnny Orr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Simpson\"&gt;Jock Simpson&lt;/a&gt;; he was not an undisputed regular in the team at &lt;a href=\"Ewood%20Park\"&gt;Ewood Park&lt;/a&gt;, but his ability to fill in at several positions meant he was often called upon. On paper, he was also contracted to &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; for five years, but in reality he only played there for 18 months before &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; led to the cancellation of official competitions in English football; he had a number of short loans at clubs in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Glasgow\"&gt;Greater Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; area (the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; continued) and served in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Army Ordnance Corps&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict.\nAt representative level, he appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Scots%20v%20Anglo-Scots\"&gt;Home Scots v Anglo-Scots&lt;/a&gt; annual trial match in 1909 but did not gain any full &lt;a href=\"Cap%20%28sport%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagerial career.\nIn 1919, Cameron became player-manager of &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bury%20F.C.\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt; and spent &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bury%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;four seasons&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the \"Shakers\" before being issued with a life ban in 1923 following an investigation into an incident three years earlier when Bury were found to have accepted payments from &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Coventry City&lt;/a&gt; officials to deliberately lose their end-of-season fixture and save Coventry from relegation at the expense of &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt; (the extent of his involvement in the incident is not clear).\nCameron's ban was eventually lifted in 1929 and he managed &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt; for the unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"1930%E2%80%9331%20Rochdale%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1930\u201331 season&lt;/a&gt; when they had to seek re-election to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt;, and the first half of &lt;a href=\"1931%E2%80%9332%20Rochdale%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1931\u201332&lt;/a&gt; which was equally poor and eventually ended with the same outcome.\nLater life.\nCameron settled with his family in &lt;a href=\"Bolton\"&gt;Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, where by the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 1939 he was working at the &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Propellers\"&gt;de Havilland Propellers&lt;/a&gt; factory. He was not related to &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Cameron%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jock Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, another Blackburn Rovers player of the era who also grew up in the Coatbridge area and settled in Lancashire."
