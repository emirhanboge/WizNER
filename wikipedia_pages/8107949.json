    "text": "Concord Oval (also Waratah Stadium) is a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in the inner west of Sydney. It is currently used mostly for &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; matches, and it was used for eight matches during the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1987 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. It also hosts &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches. The stadium is able to hold 20,000 people and was opened in 1985.\nIt is the home ground of &lt;a href=\"West%20Harbour%20RFC\"&gt;West Harbour RFC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shute%20Shield\"&gt;Shute Shield&lt;/a&gt; rugby union competition, and the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Sydney%20Rams\"&gt;Greater Sydney Rams&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;National Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the training and administration base for the &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt; rugby league club. Football club &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Lions%20SC\"&gt;Inter Lions SC&lt;/a&gt; also play games at the ground.\nFacilities.\nThe stadium has two opposing grandstands. The eastern stand hosts the tennis box-style seats, television gantry and the change rooms. The stand runs approximately from try-line to try-line. The western stand contains a gym and some boxes. This stand runs approximately from dead-ball line to dead ball line. In front of the western stand are two rows of seats, while a concrete path runs around the field (except not in front of the aforementioned two rows of seats, the path runs behind those seats). At each end there is a grassy hill, and at the southern or Parramatta Road end, there is a wooden, manually operated scoreboard with an analogue clock.\nThe stadium is bordered by Gipps Street to the north, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Western%20Highway\"&gt;Parramatta Road&lt;/a&gt; to the south, Loftus Street to the west and the Cintra Hockey Centre to the east. Parking is at a premium with small carparks behind the northern hill, eastern stand and in the south-east corner, although &lt;a href=\"Burwood%20railway%20station%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Burwood train station&lt;/a&gt; is not too far away, and the 439, L39, 464 and 466 bus routes pass close to the stadium.\nHistory.\nSt Luke's Park, which was the home ground of Sydney's &lt;a href=\"Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies\"&gt;Western Suburbs Magpies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; club in &lt;a href=\"1910%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1910&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1911%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt; was where Concord Oval is now located. Wests started playing their matches at &lt;a href=\"Pratten%20Park\"&gt;Pratten Park&lt;/a&gt; in 1912, but after pressure from local residents there the council refused the club permission to use that ground, forcing them to return to St. Luke's Oval from 1915 to 1919. From 1920 Wests resumed playing at Pratten Park.\nConcord Oval in its present form was constructed between 1984 and 1987 to become the home of &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union\"&gt;Rugby union&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney and subsequently the redeveloped venue hosted games in the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1987 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium also hosted four first grade &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; matches, three of them in 1994 as &lt;a href=\"Bulldogs%20Rugby%20League%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Canterbury's&lt;/a&gt; second home ground during that season.\nIn the early 2010s the City of Canada Bay Council prepared a masterplan to bring major events back to an expanded and rejuvenated Concord Oval. This includes construction and installation of broadcasting equipment such as satellite dishes, antennas, camera platforms and commentary boxes, as well as training quality floodlighting and a new scoreboard.\nIn 2020, it was announced that the Concord Oval will undergo a $51 million redevelopment to accommodate the &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt; new training and administration complex to be completed by mid\u20132021. Demolition works began in mid-2020 with the Eastern Stand completely demolished by July 2020.\nRugby World Cup.\nConcord Oval hosted six matches of the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;."
