The Angels won their 89th game of the season on September 9 to ensure that they would become the first post-1960 expansion team to finish a season with an all-time winning record since &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Houston%20Astros%20seasons\"&gt;the Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the 2006 MLB season.\nThe Angels finished the season with the best record in all of Major League Baseball, but they were swept by the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;American League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;."
