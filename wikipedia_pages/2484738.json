    "text": "Monitor was an executive &lt;a href=\"non-departmental%20public%20body\"&gt;non-departmental public body&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, responsible between 2004 and 2016 for ensuring healthcare provision in &lt;a href=\"NHS%20England\"&gt;NHS England&lt;/a&gt; was financially effective. It was the sector regulator for health services in England. Its chief executive was Ian Dalton and it was chaired by &lt;a href=\"Dido%20Harding\"&gt;Dido Harding&lt;/a&gt;. Monitor was merged with the &lt;a href=\"NHS%20Trust%20Development%20Authority\"&gt;NHS Trust Development Authority&lt;/a&gt; to form &lt;a href=\"NHS%20Improvement\"&gt;NHS Improvement&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 2016.\nHistory.\nThe body was established in 2004 under the &lt;a href=\"Health%20and%20Social%20Care%20%28Community%20Health%20and%20Standards%29%20Act%202003\"&gt;Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003&lt;/a&gt;, which made it responsible for authorising, monitoring and regulating NHS &lt;a href=\"foundation%20trust\"&gt;foundation trust&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Health%20and%20Social%20Care%20Act%202012\"&gt;Health and Social Care Act 2012&lt;/a&gt; gave Monitor additional duties.\nIn addition to assessing NHS trusts for foundation trust status and ensuring that foundation trusts are well led, in terms of quality and finances, Monitor had a duty to:\nMonitor's main tool for carrying out these functions was the NHS provider licence, which contains obligations for providers of NHS services. The 2012 Act requires everyone who provides an NHS health care service to hold a licence unless they are exempt under regulations made by the Department of Health. Foundation trusts were licensed from 1 April 2013, and all other non-exempt providers were required to apply for a licence from April 2014.\nIt was announced in June 2015 that the chief executive posts at Monitor and the &lt;a href=\"NHS%20Trust%20Development%20Authority\"&gt;NHS Trust Development Authority&lt;/a&gt; were to be merged, although there would not be a complete merger of the organisations. In April 2016 both organisations became part of &lt;a href=\"NHS%20Improvement\"&gt;NHS Improvement&lt;/a&gt;.\nCriticism.\nIn July 2014, Monitor was criticised by the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Accounts%20Committee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons (PAC)&lt;/a&gt; for the lack of clinical expertise and frontline NHS experience amongst its staff. The PAC noted that: \u201cOnly 21 of Monitor's 337 staff have an NHS operational background and only 7 have a clinical background, which damages Monitor's credibility in dealing with trusts and its effectiveness in diagnosing problems and developing solutions\u201d. The PAC also criticised the proportion of Monitor\u2019s budget spent on external consultants (\u00a39 million of Monitor's \u00a348 million budget in 2013-14) and found that \u201csome NHS foundation trusts had been allowed to struggle for far too long in breach of their regulatory conditions. It has taken Monitor too long to help trusts in difficulty to improve, with three trusts having been in breach of their regulatory conditions since 2009\u201d. At the time of the PAC\u2019s hearing, of 147 foundation trusts 39(26%) were expected to be in deficit by the end of 2013-14 and on 31 December 2013 25 (17%) were in breach of the conditions attached to their status.\nThe PAC also noted: \u201cIt is wholly inappropriate that the same person acted as both Chair and Chief Executive of Monitor between March 2011 and January 2014. This was contrary to corporate governance good practice and Monitor's own guidance to NHS foundation trusts\u201d. The board of MONITOR has a majority representation from former or seconded employees of KPMG, PWC and Deloitte while still awarding contracts to these organisations worth millions of pounds.\nRegulatory action.\nIn July 2013 six &lt;a href=\"NHS%20foundation%20trust\"&gt;NHS foundation trust&lt;/a&gt;s were &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.monitor.gov.uk/home/news-events-publications/latest-press-releases/health-sector-regulator-puts-six-foundation-trus\"&gt;placed in special measures&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Keogh%20Review\"&gt;Keogh Review&lt;/a&gt; of patient safety:\nSubsequent trusts placed in special measures:\nEnforcement action has been taken on 21 occasions in the first 10 months of 2013/4, compared to just nine instances in the whole of 2012-13. Monitor's former chief executive David Bennett admitted the regulator\u2019s \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d distance from foundation trusts had become \u201ca little shorter\u201d as it intervened more readily and that increased monitoring and intervention was explained by \u201ca declined appetite for risk\u201d among \u201cParliament, the government and the public\u201d.\nDetails of the regulatory action Monitor has taken at NHS foundation trusts are available on its website: http://www.monitor.gov.uk/about-your-local-nhs-foundation-trust/regulatory-action/nhs-foundation-trusts-special-measures-or-un.\nIn August 2015 Monitor issued a letter to all Foundation Trusts telling them to fill vacancies \u201conly where essential\u201d and warning that current financial plans are \u201cquite simply unaffordable\u201d as NHS providers collectively forecast a deficit of \u00a32bn in 2015-16.\nStafford Hospital investigation.\nIn 2010 the &lt;a href=\"Stafford%20Hospital%20scandal\"&gt;Stafford Hospital scandal&lt;/a&gt; investigation recommended that Monitor de-authorise the &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Staffordshire%20NHS%20Foundation%20Trust\"&gt;Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn line with the investigation report recommendation, &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health\"&gt;Secretary of State for Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Burnham\"&gt;Andy Burnham&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to a further Independent Inquiry of the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies for Foundation Trusts.\nAnti-competitive behaviour.\n&lt;a href=\"Spire%20Healthcare\"&gt;Spire Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; alleged in 2013 that a block contract agreed between &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20Teaching%20Hospitals%20NHS%20Foundation%20Trust\"&gt;Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"clinical%20commissioning%20group\"&gt;clinical commissioning group&lt;/a&gt;s in Blackpool, and Fylde and Wyre offered a \u201cclear incentive\u201d for GPs to refer patients to the foundation trust and that this was anti-competitive behaviour. The contract provided the trust with a guaranteed income regardless of the number of patients that chose to use its services. Monitor conducted an investigation and decided In September 2014 that there was no evidence to support the claim though they did conclude that Blackpool CCG\u2019s plans did not \u201cgo far enough\u201d to ensure patients would be offered choice, or that the right to choice would be \u201cpublicised and promoted\u201d. Blackpool CCG complained that not a single GP, practice manager or patient was spoken to by the investigating team, nor was a single practice visited.\nIn September 2014 former chief executive David Bennett admitted that the organisation had yet to identify a strategy to counter those opposed to competition because it clashed with their personal ideologies. He claimed organisations were using competition regulations as an \u201ceasy excuse\u201d for avoiding making necessary changes.\nIn October 2014 after the publication of &lt;a href=\"NHS%20England\"&gt;NHS England&lt;/a&gt;'s \u2018Five year forward view\u2019 Bennett defended Choice and competition as \"one of the ways in which we can drive change and improvement for patients, and we don\u2019t see that that will cease to be the case\u201d - though competition was not mentioned by NHS England. He also said that Monitor, the &lt;a href=\"NHS%20Trust%20Development%20Authority\"&gt;NHS Trust Development Authority&lt;/a&gt; and NHS England planned to develop \u201ca whole system, geographically based intervention regime\u201d which could, include a \u2018special measures\u2019 approach to areas facing serious problems with care."
