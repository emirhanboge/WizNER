    "text": "Clemole or tlemole is a traditional dish in Mexican cuisine. It is a soup where meat, vegetables and strong flavor elements are combined. When beef or poultry meat is fried and boiled in a stock pot, then green beans, corn chunks and zucchini pieces are added. Chili peppers are roasted, soaked in hot water and ground on a &lt;a href=\"metate\"&gt;metate&lt;/a&gt; with a little garlic, cloves and black pepper. This is fried in oil or lard with a few onion slices, making a sauce that is added to the broth, which should not be too thick .\nReferences.\nGironella De'angeli, Alicia. Larousse de la cocina mexicana. (2006). "
