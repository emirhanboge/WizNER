    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin&lt;/a&gt;'s Waltz No. 19 in &lt;a href=\"A%20minor\"&gt;A minor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin%20by%20opus%20number%23Works%20without%20opus%20numbers\"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;. 150, &lt;a href=\"Krystyna%20Kobyla%C5%84ska\"&gt;KK&lt;/a&gt; IVb/11, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Micha%C5%82%20Chomi%C5%84ski\"&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;. 2/11, is a &lt;a href=\"Waltz%20%28music%29\"&gt;waltz&lt;/a&gt; for solo &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;. The waltz was written sometime between 1843 and 1848, but was not published until 1860, after the composer's death, by Jacques Maho. At this time, it was attributed to &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Charlotte de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; and was published as No. 3 of \"Four pieces for piano\". This collection also included Chopin's &lt;a href=\"Nocturne%20in%20C%20minor%2C%20Op.%20posth.%20%28Chopin%29\"&gt;Nocturne in C minor, B. 108&lt;/a&gt;. It was not until 1955, 95 years after its initial publishing, that it was correctly attributed to Chopin.\nStructure.\nThis waltz is structured as a single &lt;a href=\"Movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"rondo\"&gt;rondo&lt;/a&gt; form marked &lt;a href=\"Tempo%23Basic%20tempo%20markings\"&gt;allegretto&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of Chopin's shortest and technically easiest waltzes.\nAnalysis.\nThe piece shows great sadness, while enclosing some episodes that hint at happiness and hope. The first &lt;a href=\"Theme%20%28music%29\"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; of the piece uses a simple but effective melody, conveying a sad portrait, with decorative &lt;a href=\"Ornament%20%28music%29\"&gt;ornaments&lt;/a&gt; used throughout. The second theme is more lively, punctuated by a brisk ascending arpeggio, although it still has a certain sadness. About halfway through the piece, there is a &lt;a href=\"Modulation%20%28music%29\"&gt;modulation&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"A%20major\"&gt;A major&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a happy and joyful melody. The piece concludes with the main theme, followed by a short &lt;a href=\"Coda%20%28music%29\"&gt;coda&lt;/a&gt;."
