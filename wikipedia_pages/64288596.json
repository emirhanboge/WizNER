    "text": "Briggs Swift Cunningham II (January 19, 1907 \u2013 July 2, 2003) was an American &lt;a href=\"entrepreneur\"&gt;entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; and sportsman. He is best known for skippering the yacht \"Columbia\" to victory in the 1958 &lt;a href=\"America%27s%20Cup\"&gt;America's Cup&lt;/a&gt; race, and for his many appearances at the &lt;a href=\"24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nCunningham was born in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio on 19 January 1907. The family were prominent, long-time residents of the Cincinnati area. Cunningham's grandfather had amassed considerable wealth operating river boats and in shipping, then had gone into the meat packing business with son Briggs Swift Cunningham Senior. The meat packing business was eventually known as Evans, Lippencott &amp; Cunningham. Cunningham Sr. later became founder and president of the Citizen's National Bank, as well as director of the Pennsylvania Railroad, among several others. Cunningham Sr. was also the chief financier of soap company &lt;a href=\"Procter%20and%20Gamble\"&gt;Procter and Gamble&lt;/a&gt;. William Cooper Procter would be Cunningham's godfather.\nCunningham Sr. died when Briggs was five years old. The estate was structured such that the Cunningham heirs did not receive full control of the estate until age forty.\nCunningham's maternal uncle was Dr. Ashton Heyl, a former &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Riders\"&gt;Rough Rider&lt;/a&gt;. Heyl had installed a &lt;a href=\"Hispano-Suiza\"&gt;Hispano-Suiza&lt;/a&gt; aircraft engine in a Dodge touring car. As a boy Cunningham was a passenger during some impromptu street races in the car with Heyl.\nCunningham's early schooling took place at Groton and the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. His university days were spent at Yale. He was also a brakeman on the Olympic bobsled team.\nOn 2 October 1929 he married Lucie Bedford, the granddaughter of &lt;a href=\"E.T.%20Bedford\"&gt;E.T. Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder and director of &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Oil\"&gt;Standard Oil&lt;/a&gt;. The couple spent an extended honeymoon in Europe, where Cunningham won a concours with a Mercedes Benz SS delivered to him personally by &lt;a href=\"Rudolph%20Caracciola\"&gt;Rudolph Caracciola&lt;/a&gt;. It was also during this trip that he attended his first major automobile race, the 1930 Monaco Grand Prix. When the couple returned to the US they settled on the Long Island Sound.\nDuring World War II (WWII) he tried to enlist in the US Navy but was deemed ineligible due to a combination of age and a pre-existing condition. He instead joined the Civil Air Patrol, flying submarine patrols off the east coast, first in a Fairchild and later a Sikorski S39B amphibious airplane, both paid for by himself.\nSailing.\nOwing to his mother's concerns about the dangers of automobile racing, Cunningham did not pursue a driving career until after her death, but did race sail boats competitively.\nAt seventeen he joined the Pequot Yacht Club and began to race &lt;a href=\"Star%20%28keelboat%29\"&gt;Star Class&lt;/a&gt; boats. He said that it was his wife who taught him to sail.\nCunningham partnered with his father-in-law Frederick T. Bedford to purchase the eight meter \"Loke\" in 1928.\nIn 1929 he bought the six meter \"Akaba\", and renamed her \"Lucie\" \u2014 the first of two of his boats with that name. In 1930 Cunningham commissioned &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20H.%20Crane\"&gt;Clinton H. Crane&lt;/a&gt; to design a new 6 meter, also to be named \"Lucie\". She was built at the Henry B. Nevins Boatyard in New York in 1931. He spent part of his honeymoon sailing the new \"Lucie\". Cunningham won 6 world titles in 6 meter yachts.\nF.T. Bedford commissioned the 12 meter \"Nyala\" as a gift for Cunningham and his daughter Lucie when they married.\nIn 1931 Cunningham was a crew member aboard the \"Dorade\" when it won the race around the &lt;a href=\"Fastnet%20Race\"&gt;Fastnet Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1937 he was a member of the crew for &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Stirling%20Vanderbilt\"&gt;Harold Stirling Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; on his yacht \"Vim\".\nCunningham bought the schooner \"&lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20%28schooner%29\"&gt;Brilliant&lt;/a&gt;\" from the Coast Guard after WWII, and modified it in an attempt to increase its speed. In 1953 he donated the \"Brilliant\" to the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Seaport\"&gt;Mystic Seaport&lt;/a&gt; to be used as an off-shore classroom.\nThe \"Brilliant\" was the first vessel to receive an improved &lt;a href=\"downhaul\"&gt;downhaul&lt;/a&gt; invented by Cunningham that has come to bear his &lt;a href=\"Cunningham%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;.\nCunningham was part of the syndicate that commissioned construction of the 12 meter sloop \"Columbia\" to contest the first post-war America's Cup race in 1958. The original choice to skipper \"Columbia\" in the America's Cup was &lt;a href=\"Cornelius%20Shields\"&gt;Cornelius \"Corny\" Shields&lt;/a&gt;, but when he was sidelined by heart troubles Cunningham stepped in and led the boat and crew to victory.\nRacing driver and team owner.\nCunningham began racing internationally in 1930 with brothers &lt;a href=\"Cowles%20%26quot%3BMiles%26quot%3B%20Collier\"&gt;Cowles \"Miles\" Collier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Collier\"&gt;Sam Collier&lt;/a&gt;. These college friends of Cunningham's established the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) in 1933, which became the &lt;a href=\"Sports%20Car%20Club%20of%20America\"&gt;Sports Car Club of America&lt;/a&gt; (SCCA) in 1944. Cunningham took part in the first ever SCCA race. He was described as one of the most successful drivers in SCCA &lt;a href=\"sports%20car%20racing\"&gt;sports car racing&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nCunningham became an early member of the Road Racing Drivers Club, an invitation-only group that honors drivers, officials, and journalists that have made significant contributions to the sport.\nCunningham's racing team arrived at the track accompanied by a large transporter that was both extensively and lavishly equipped, along with the drivers, a retinue of professionals and mechanics, and the cars. The team's chief mechanic was Alfredo Momo.\nOn 31 December 1950 Cunningham raced an &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Martin%20DB2\"&gt;Aston Martin DB2&lt;/a&gt; in the 6-hour Sam Collier Memorial Race, the first automobile race held at the &lt;a href=\"Sebring%20International%20Raceway\"&gt;Sebring Airport race track&lt;/a&gt;. Cunningham finished third in class and seventeenth overall. His car, serial number LML/50/21, was one of the first, if not the first, DB2 Vantage built.\n1955 was the last year that Cunningham built his own cars, the company having run out the five-year grace period that the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Revenue%20Service\"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; allowed low-volume manufacturers to become profitable.\nCunningham continued in international competition from 1930 until 1963, when he dissolved his Le Mans team. His final professional race was in a &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20904\"&gt;Porsche Carrera GTS (Type 904)&lt;/a&gt; at Sebring in 1966 with John Fitch and Davey Jordan. His last amateur race was in the same Porsche 904 at Riverside Raceway in September 1966.\nCars.\nNumber 5 Special.\nOne of Cunningham's first racing cars and his only &lt;a href=\"Sprint%20car%20racing\"&gt;sprint car&lt;/a&gt; was the \"Number 5 Special\". Built by R.T. Jackson of Dayton, Ohio, the car was driven by \"Ed\" Coffey.\nThe car had a custom frame and was powered by a &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Model%20T\"&gt;Ford Model T&lt;/a&gt; inline four-cylinder engine with a &lt;a href=\"Multi-valve\"&gt;16 valve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overhead%20camshaft%20engine%23Double%20overhead%20camshaft\"&gt;double-overhead camshaft&lt;/a&gt; Frontenac \"Fronty\" cylinder head.\nCunningham owned the car in 1933, and the next year sold it to Gil Pirrung of Missouri.\nBu-Merc.\nThis special was based on the chassis, drivetrain and running gear of a 1939 &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Century%23First%20generation%20%281936%E2%80%931942%29\"&gt;Buick Century&lt;/a&gt;. Cunningham had &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Shafer\"&gt;Phil Shafer&lt;/a&gt; modify the car by lowering the &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Straight-8%20engine\"&gt;Buick Straight-8 engine&lt;/a&gt; and moving it back in the chassis. The engine's compression ratio was raised. The body and radiator came from a wrecked &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Benz%20SSK\"&gt;Mercedes Benz SSK&lt;/a&gt;, and were adapted to the Buick chassis by Byron Jersey.\nIn 1940 the Bu-Merc appeared at the Worlds Fair Grand Prix at the New York Fairgrounds. Driven by \"Miles\" Collier, it did not finish due to an accident.\nCunningham drove the Bu-Merc at the first Grand Prix held at &lt;a href=\"Watkins%20Glen%20International\"&gt;Watkins Glen&lt;/a&gt; in 1948, where he finished second. After receiving a 1949 version of the Straight-8 and chassis modifications suggested by Buick's Vice President of Engineering Charles Chayne, the car appeared at Watkins Glen the next year with Cunningham driving to a third place finish.\nCadillac-Healey.\nIn 1950 Cunningham campaigned a &lt;a href=\"Healey%20Silverstone\"&gt;Healey Silverstone&lt;/a&gt; cycle-fendered racer into which he had installed one of Cadillac's new &lt;a href=\"Cadillac%20V8%20engine%23331%20series\"&gt;V8 engines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car appeared at Palm Beach on 3 January 1950. Driven by Cunningham, it finished second.\nOn 23 September that year the car was driven by Cunningham again at Watkins Glen, and finished second. At this race Samuel \"Sam\" Carnes Collier was killed while driving Cunningham's Ferrari.\nThe Cadillac-Healey also appeared at the 6 Hours of Sebring on 31 December 1950. Co-driven by &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Walters\"&gt;Phil Walters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Frick\"&gt;Bill Frick&lt;/a&gt;, it finished twelfth overall and third in class.\n\"Petit Pataud\" and \"Le Monstre\".\nWhen his plan to enter a Fordillac hybrid in the &lt;a href=\"1950%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1950 24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; was rejected by the organizers, Cunningham entered two &lt;a href=\"Cadillac\"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nThe first was a stock-appearing &lt;a href=\"Cadillac%20Series%2061\"&gt;Cadillac Series 61&lt;/a&gt; that the French dubbed \"Petit Pataud\"; possibly a reference to a puppy in a French children's book from the 1930s. Changes to the car were minimal, and included a dual-carburetor intake manifold, brake cooling ducts, a second fuel tank, and extra lights.\nWhile engine swaps were illegal, body modifications were permitted, so a second Cadillac had its stock body removed and an entirely new body that was lower and narrower than the original fabricated in aluminum over a metal tube framework. The new body was designed and built with the help of engineer Howard Weinmann from &lt;a href=\"Grumman\"&gt;Grumman&lt;/a&gt;. Another feature was the use of five carburetors. This car was nicknamed \"Le Monstre\".\nThe Collier brothers partnered to drive \"Petit Pataud\", and finished in tenth place. Cunningham and co-driver Phil Walters were in \"Le Monstre\", and finished eleventh.\nB. S. Cunningham Company cars.\nTo prepare for his next attempt at Le Mans, Cunningham bought the Frick-Tappet Motors company and relocated the operation from Long Island, New York to West Palm Beach, Florida, renaming it the \"B.S. Cunningham Company\".\nThe first product of the new company was the Cunningham C-1, powered by a Cadillac V8. Only one was built. Very similar to the C-1 were the three subsequent C-2Rs, all built to racing specifications. Cunningham substituted a V8 for the Cadillac in the C-1. The C-2R first appeared at Le Mans in 1951.\nTo be homologated as a manufacturer for Le Mans, Cunningham undertook to build 25 examples of the C-3 road car. The C-3s used an upgraded version of the Chrysler FirePower V8. Production of the C-3 is variously reported to have been twenty-five (twenty coupes and five convertibles) or twenty-seven (eighteen coupes and nine convertibles).\nThe next racing car for the B.S. Cunningham Company was designed by &lt;a href=\"G.%20Briggs%20Weaver\"&gt;G. Briggs Weaver&lt;/a&gt;. Two C-4R roadsters were built, as well as a single C-4RK coupe with truncated rear bodywork. The cars debuted at the &lt;a href=\"1952%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1952 24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor 1953 a single all-new C-5R was prepared for Le Mans. The Chrysler V8 engine remained, with power increased by . When the car arrived for the 1953 Le Mans, French observers named it \"Le Requin Souriant\" \u2014 the smiling shark.\nThe final B. S. Cunningham company car model abandoned the Chrysler V8 for a 3.0\u00a0L four-cylinder &lt;a href=\"Offenhauser\"&gt;Offenhauser&lt;/a&gt; from Meyer &amp; Drake. At the &lt;a href=\"1955%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1955 Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; the C-6R retired on lap 202.\nOther marques.\nAmong the earliest cars that Cunningham raced or lent to race was a series of MGs. In 1934 he owned an &lt;a href=\"MG%20J-type%23J2\"&gt;MG J2&lt;/a&gt; that he personally drove in select ARCA events. Two years later he loaned his &lt;a href=\"MG%20K-type%23K3\"&gt;MG K3 Magnette&lt;/a&gt; to \"Miles\" Collier and George Rand, who campaigned it in Europe. Cunningham's supercharged &lt;a href=\"MG%20T-type%23C%20Midget\"&gt;MG TC&lt;/a&gt; appeared alongside the Bu-Merc at the inaugural Watkins Glen Grand Prix in 1948. Driven by Haig Ksayian, the TC finished first in class and third overall.\nCunningham had originally planned to enter a team of \"Fordillacs\" at Le Mans. The cars were 1949 Fords with Cadillac OHV V8s installed. The conversion had been designed by Bill Frick and was built by Frick-Tappet Motors.\nIn 1949 Cunningham partnered with Alfredo Momo, and bought &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20166%20S\"&gt;Ferrari 166 Spider Corsa&lt;/a&gt; 016-I from &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Chinetti\"&gt;Luigi Chinetti&lt;/a&gt;. This was the second Ferrari in the US, the first being a Tipo 166 MM Touring Barchetta, chassis 0002 M, sold to Tommy Lee in Los Angeles in the first quarter of 1949. 016-I was the first Ferrari raced in the US.\nIn 1954 Cunningham's 1.5-liter &lt;a href=\"O.S.C.A.%20MT4\"&gt;O.S.C.A. MT4&lt;/a&gt; driven by &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Moss\"&gt;Stirling Moss&lt;/a&gt; and Bill Lloyd was the outright winner of the &lt;a href=\"12%20Hours%20of%20Sebring\"&gt;12 Hours of Sebring&lt;/a&gt;. The team won at Sebring again the following year, this time with a &lt;a href=\"Jaguar%20D-Type\"&gt;Jaguar D-Type&lt;/a&gt;.\nCunningham entered a &lt;a href=\"Automobili%20Stanguellini\"&gt;Stanguellini&lt;/a&gt; of just 750\u00a0cc for the 1954 race at Watkins Glen, with driver Marshall Lewis. The car won its H Modified class, while John Gordon Bennett was second in a Cunningham O.S.C.A. MT4 1450.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"1954%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1954 24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; Cunningham fielded a &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20375%20MM\"&gt;Ferrari 375 MM&lt;/a&gt; with experimental water-cooled drum brakes. The car retired.\nCunningham owned three &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20300S\"&gt;Maserati 300S&lt;/a&gt; cars. Chassis 3053 finished third overall on its debut race at the 1955 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Bill Spear and Sherwood Johnston.\nIn 1958 Cunningham fielded two &lt;a href=\"Lister%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Lister&lt;/a&gt;-Jaguar \"Knobbly\"s. Prepared by Alfredo Momo, the pair delivered an SCCA C Modified championship in 1958.\nIn 1959 Cunningham upgraded to the Lister-Costin, still Jaguar-powered but with revised bodywork by aerodynamicist &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Costin\"&gt;Frank Costin&lt;/a&gt;. The result was another SCCA C Modified championship.\nFor 1960 the displacement rules for &lt;a href=\"1960%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; were changed to permit cars with engines larger than 3.0\u00a0L. With GM's tacit support and with assistance from &lt;a href=\"Zora%20Arkus-Duntov\"&gt;Zora Arkus-Duntov&lt;/a&gt;, Cunningham began preparing a trio of &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet%20Corvette%20%28C1%29%231958%E2%80%931960\"&gt;Corvettes&lt;/a&gt; for the race. As a trial before Le Mans, two Momo-prepared Cunningham Corvettes were entered in the &lt;a href=\"1960%2012%20Hours%20of%20Sebring\"&gt;1960 12 Hours of Sebring&lt;/a&gt;, but neither car finished. At Le Mans Cunningham entered three Corvettes and one &lt;a href=\"Jaguar%20E-Type\"&gt;Jaguar E-Type&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers for the cars were Cunningham and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Kimberley\"&gt;Bill Kimberley&lt;/a&gt; in the #1 Corvette, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Thompson%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Dick Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Windridge\"&gt;Fred Windridge&lt;/a&gt; in the #2 Corvette, John Fitch and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Grossman\"&gt;Bob Grossman&lt;/a&gt; in the #3 Corvette, and &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Gurney\"&gt;Dan Gurney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Hansgen\"&gt;Walt Hansgen&lt;/a&gt; in the Jaguar. The #1 Corvette driven by Kimberly went off the course and caught fire on lap 32, and the #2 car went out with engine trouble on lap 89, as did the Jaguar. The #3 car began to overheat, and the pit crew packed ice around the engine to cool it. It finished in eighth place overall, with a fifth place in the GT category and first in the GT up to 5.0\u00a0 class.\nIn August 1960 Cunningham bought a &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Tipo%2061\"&gt;Maserati Tipo 60 \"Birdcage\"&lt;/a&gt;, that he drove in the &lt;a href=\"1961%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1961 24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; with co-driver &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kimberly\"&gt;Jim Kimberly&lt;/a&gt;. The pair finished eighth overall in the car, and third in class.\nCunningham also owned two different Stanguellini &lt;a href=\"Formula%20Junior\"&gt;Formula Junior&lt;/a&gt; cars; a front-engined 750\u00a0cc car and a rear-engined 1100\u00a0 \"Delfino\".\nIn October 1961 a &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20T53\"&gt;Cooper T53&lt;/a&gt; owned by Cunningham appeared in the &lt;a href=\"1961%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;US Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;. The entrant of record is the Momo Corporation, and the car was driven by Walt Hansgen, who crashed on lap 14 of his F1 debut. The chassis was later sold to Roger Penske and became the &lt;a href=\"Zerex%20Special\"&gt;Zerex Special&lt;/a&gt;, then was resold to Bruce McLaren and became the first car raced by the McLaren team.\nA &lt;a href=\"Fiat-Abarth%20750%231000%20Zagato\"&gt;Fiat-Abarth 1000 Bialbero&lt;/a&gt; Competition coupe owned by Cunningham, prepared by Alfredo Momo's Momo Corporation, and driven by &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20McLaren\"&gt;Bruce McLaren&lt;/a&gt; won the 1961 3 Hours of Sebring for Grand Touring cars up to 1\u00a0L.\nCunningham entered two &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Tipo%20151\"&gt;Maserati Tipo 151&lt;/a&gt; coupes in the &lt;a href=\"1962%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1962 Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;, along with a Jaguar E-Type. Both Maseratis failed to finish.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"1963%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;1963 Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; Cunningham entered a Jaguar E-Type Lightweight that he drove to a ninth place finish.\nIn 1964 Cunningham was co-owner and co-driver with &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Underwood\"&gt;Lake Underwood&lt;/a&gt; in a class-winning Porsche 904 at &lt;a href=\"1964%2012%20Hours%20of%20Sebring\"&gt;Sebring&lt;/a&gt;. The next year they won the 2-liter class and finished ninth overall with a 904.\nMuseum.\nOver the course of his life Cunningham amassed a large and varied collection of automobiles, including many of his own former racing cars. After relocating to the West Coast, he purchased a property at 250 E. Baker Street, &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Mesa%2C%20California\"&gt;Costa Mesa, California&lt;/a&gt; and established the Briggs Cunningham Museum to house his collection. A building became the museum gallery, which opened officially on 5 February 1966.\nThe museum was in operation for twenty-one years. Expected changes to capital gains tax laws prompted Cunningham to consider closing the museum in late 1986. Instead, the 71 cars in the museum collection were sold to Miles Collier, the son of long-time friend Cowles \"Miles\" Collier, and relocated to &lt;a href=\"Naples%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Naples, Florida&lt;/a&gt; as the Collier Automotive Museum Collection. The Collier Collection later became part of the Revs Institute display.\nPersonal life.\nCunningham was featured on the 26 April 1954 cover of &lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; magazine, along with three Cunningham racing cars. \nCunningham died in Las Vegas at the age of 96 from complications of &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was survived by former wife Lucie Bedford Warren and their three children, Briggs Swift Cunningham III, Lucie, and Cythlen. He was also survived by wife Laura Cramer Elmer and two step-sons."
