    "title": "2009 SEC Championship Game",
    "text": "The 2009 &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; was played on December 5, 2009, in the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, to determine the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; champion of the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SEC). The game featured the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida Gators&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama Crimson Tide&lt;/a&gt;. The Crimson Tide was the designated \"home team\"; this home team, chosen on an alternating basis, was 2\u20134 in SEC Championship Games. The winner was all but assured to go on to play for a &lt;a href=\"BCS%20National%20Championship\"&gt;National Championship&lt;/a&gt;, in a likely matchup with the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Texas%20Longhorns%20football%20team\"&gt;Texas Longhorns&lt;/a&gt; provided Texas won in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Big%2012%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;Big 12 Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; versus the north division champion &lt;a href=\"2009%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska Cornhuskers&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the 2009 contest, the SEC East was 11\u20136 in SEC Championship games, with the Florida Gators accounting for seven of the eleven victories. Before the 2009 game, Alabama represented the SEC West six times in the conference championship game, compiling a 2\u20134 record, and had faced the Gators in all six of their previous SEC Championship game appearances. This was the first and so far the only time any conference championship game had featured two undefeated teams and was also the first time an AP Poll No. 1 played a No. 2 outside of the BCS Championship Game since the top-ranked &lt;a href=\"2006%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; beat the second-ranked &lt;a href=\"2006%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; during the 2006 regular season.\nThe game began at 4:00\u00a0p.m. &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; and was televised by &lt;a href=\"SEC%20on%20CBS\"&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt;, for the ninth straight season. The game was also streamed online at CBSSports.com and on mobile for customers subscribing to the MediaFLO service on CBS Sports Mobile.\nAlabama defeated Florida 32\u201313 and as expected secured a berth to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2010 BCS National Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; where they would go on to defeat Texas. This game is often considered the moment when the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20under%20Nick%20Saban\"&gt;Alabama dynasty&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest after a &lt;a href=\"2007%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;disappointing 2007 season&lt;/a&gt; and a loss to the same &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Tebow\"&gt;Tebow&lt;/a&gt;-led Gators in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2008 SEC Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniforms.\nAlabama wore its standard home uniform, while Florida wore an all-white combination of its Nike Pro Combat helmet and its usual white uniform."
