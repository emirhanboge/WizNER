    "text": "Louis de Rohan-Chabot (3 November 1652 \u2013 17 August 1727) was a member of the House of Rohan-Chabot and &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Rohan\"&gt;Duke of Rohan&lt;/a&gt;. He married an heiress and acted as &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt;'s representative in &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. He was styled as the Prince of L\u00e9on prior to becoming Duke of Rohan. His direct descendant is today's &lt;a href=\"Josselin%20de%20Rohan\"&gt;Josselin de Rohan&lt;/a&gt; (born 5 June 1938), a member of the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20France\"&gt;Senate of France&lt;/a&gt;, representing the Morbihan department.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn at the H\u00f4tel de la rue du Temple in Paris, to Henri Chabot and his wife &lt;a href=\"Marguerite%20de%20Rohan\"&gt;Marguerite de Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, Louis was the fifth of six children and their only surviving son. His parents' marriage had caused a scandal; his mother Marguerite was a &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Prince\"&gt;Foreign Prince&lt;/a&gt;ss as a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rohan\"&gt;House of Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, and her wedding plans had caused Louis XIV to issue a decree that she was permitted to marry Henri and still hold her high rank at court.\nHenri's family were allowed to bear the name of Rohan-Chabot, the hyphenation of his maternal and paternal family names.\nAround 1700, Louis was at Court. The &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Gu%C3%A9m%C3%A9n%C3%A9\"&gt;Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9 branch&lt;/a&gt; of the House of Rohan wanted him to abandon the name and coat-of-arms of his mother's family. However, King Louis XIV confirmed his rights to the name, title and coat-of-arms, to which his father had been entitled since 19 September 1646, part of his parents' marriage contract.\nLouis was close to his older sister &lt;a href=\"Anne%20de%20Rohan-Chabot\"&gt;Anne de Rohan-Chabot&lt;/a&gt;, future &lt;a href=\"Princess%20of%20Soubise\"&gt;Princess of Soubise&lt;/a&gt; and mistress of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt;. His youngest sister, Jeanne Pelagie, married the Prince of Epinoy, the paternal grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Joyeuse%20%281694%E2%80%931724%29\"&gt;Louis de Melun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Julie%20de%20Melun\"&gt;Anne Julie de Melun&lt;/a&gt;, a future Princess of Soubise. Louis' nephews included &lt;a href=\"Hercule%20M%C3%A9riadec%2C%20Duke%20of%20Rohan-Rohan\"&gt;Hercule M\u00e9riadec, Duke of Rohan-Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Gaston%20Maximilien%20de%20Rohan\"&gt;Cardinal de Soubise&lt;/a&gt;. Louis' godparents were the infant Louis XIV and the infant's mother &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Anne of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Regent.\nCareer.\nLouis was very rich, with an annual income of 50,000 &lt;a href=\"European%20Currency%20Unit\"&gt;ecus&lt;/a&gt;, but he was a miser and greedy. His greed caused him to fall out with his sister Anne, which led to bad relations with the king himself.\nMilitary service.\nLouis campaigned in &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; in 1667, and in the same year he became head of the nobility in Brittany and was the king's representative there. He was also involved in sieges at &lt;a href=\"Tournai\"&gt;Tournai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Douai\"&gt;Douai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lille\"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Marie \u00c9lisabeth de Bec-Crespin de Grimaldi, marquise de Vardes, a granddaughter of &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20de%20Bueil\"&gt;Jacqueline de Bueil&lt;/a&gt;, mistress of King &lt;a href=\"Henri%20IV\"&gt;Henri IV&lt;/a&gt;. Louis and Marie \u00c9lisabeth were married on 18 July 1678 at the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Saint-Cloud\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, residence of &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans\"&gt;Philippe de France, \"Monsieur\"&lt;/a&gt; (brother of Louis XIV) and his wife &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Charlotte%20of%20the%20Palatinate\"&gt;Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, \"Madame\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis wife brought a considerable dowry. She was the sole heiress of her father, Fran\u00e7ois Ren\u00e9 du Bec-Crespin, marquis de Vardes, comte de Moret, and Catherine Nicola\u00ef, marquise de Goussainville. Louis and Jacqueline had 11 children, of which two sons and a daughter would go on to have progeny. Their children were:\nLouis died in Paris on 17 August 1727, aged 74. He was buried at the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Blain\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Blain&lt;/a&gt;. Marie \u00c9lisabeth survived him until 27 March 1743, when she, too, died in Paris, aged 81."
