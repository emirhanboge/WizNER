    "text": "The M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual (hereinafter, \"M-21 Manual\" or \"Manual\") details policies and procedures for &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Benefits%20Administration\"&gt;Veterans Benefits Administration&lt;/a&gt; (VBA) staff who develop and adjudicate U.S. veterans' &lt;a href=\"Disability%20benefits\"&gt;disability benefit&lt;/a&gt; claims.\nThe federal government produces thousands of procedural and policy manuals every year. The \"M-21 Manual\" stands out as notable because each year over 400,000 veterans file claims with the &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Benefits%20Administration\"&gt;Veterans Benefits Administration&lt;/a&gt; for disability compensation, financial hardship pensions, vocational rehabilitation services, and burial benefits\u2014with total program net outlays amounting to over $90 billion each year.\nMany of those 400,000 veterans and family members, along with veterans service officers; veterans law attorneys; Board of Veterans Appeals attorneys and judges; legal scholars; and federal judges consult the \"M-21 Manual\" to better understand &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs\"&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt; policies and procedures for all programs administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration. For example, from 1992 through 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Veterans%20Appeals\"&gt;Board of Veterans Appeals&lt;/a&gt; cited the \"M21-1 Manual\" 113,029 times, and the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20Veterans%20Claims\"&gt;Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims&lt;/a&gt; cited the \"Manual \"4,034 times. In addition, over 100 scholarly articles, mostly in law review journals, have cited the M21-1 Manual.\nFeatures.\nThe M21-1 Manual contains features designed to assist Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) staff and other users.\nIn-text hyperlinked references.\nThe \"Manual \"frequently references &lt;a href=\"statutes\"&gt;statutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"regulations\"&gt;regulations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"case%20law\"&gt;case law&lt;/a&gt; relevant to the particular policy or procedure discussed therein.\nContinuously updated.\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) continuously updates the \"Manual\", with the dates of any additions, deletions, or modifications provided within the \"Manual\" itself.\nImproved usability.\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration has made an effort to improve the &lt;a href=\"Web%20usability\"&gt;usability&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Manual\". Beginning in 2015 the agency transferred the \"Manual \"from the WARMS (Web Automated Reference Material System) platform to their \"KnowVA Knowledge Base\".\nCase law summaries.\nThe \"Manual \"includes a concise synopsis of important veterans law cases decided by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20Veterans%20Claims\"&gt;Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit\"&gt;Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegal status.\nThe M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual does not constitute &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Code\"&gt;statutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Federal%20Regulations\"&gt;federal regulations&lt;/a&gt;, and federal &lt;a href=\"case%20law\"&gt;case law&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Veterans Affairs has stated, \u201c[t]he M21-1 is an internal manual used to convey guidance to VA adjudicators. It is not intended to establish substantive rules beyond those contained in statute and regulation.\u201d At the same time, federal courts consult the M-21 Manual to determine if VA's actions conform with their own regulations, policies, and procedures, and to gain insight into the meaning and intent of VA regulations.\nDoes the \"M21-1 Manual\" constitute rule-making subject to review by the Federal Circuit?\nVeterans advocacy organizations such as &lt;a href=\"Disabled%20American%20Veterans\"&gt;Disabled American Veterans&lt;/a&gt; (DAV) and the National Organization of Veterans' Advocates (NOVA) have argued that many additions to the \"M21-1 Manual\" constitute \"interpretative rules\" and that the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit\"&gt;Federal Circuit&lt;/a&gt; therefore has jurisdiction to review such changes upon direct appeal by a veteran. The Federal Circuit concluded in 2017 that \"M2-1 Manual\" provisions do \"not \"fall under the purview of the Court. However, in 2020 the court overruled aspects of that decision in \"National Organization of Veterans\u2019 Advocates, Inc. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs\" (Fed. Cir. 2020), which was a unanimous &lt;a href=\"en%20banc\"&gt;en banc&lt;/a&gt; decision. \nIn an amicus brief for that 2020 case (\"NOVA v. Sec'y Veterans Affs.\"), the National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20of%20Foreign%20Wars\"&gt;Veterans of Foreign Wars&lt;/a&gt; (VFW), and &lt;a href=\"Paralyzed%20Veterans%20of%20America\"&gt;Paralyzed Veterans of America&lt;/a&gt; (PVA) had argued:\nCongress require[s] Federal Register publication of all generally applicable interpretive rules ... [the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot] evade section 552(a)(1) by issuing a generally applicable rule in the [M21-1 Adjudication Procedures] Manual. Promulgation of \u201cinterpretations of general applicability\u201d via a manual does not make them any less reviewable. If DAV\u2019s [\"DAV v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs\" (Fed. Cir. 2017)] erroneous mutual exclusivity theory survives, DVA [Department of Veterans Affairs] can insulate substantive rules and generally applicable policy statements and interpretations, and avoid pre-enforcement judicial review, simply by promulgating them through the Manual.\nIn \"NOVA v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs\" (Fed. Cir. 2020), the court stated that the \"government also concedes that whether an interpretive rule is actually published in the Federal Register does not dictate whether this court has jurisdiction, as 'VA cannot insulate a rule from pre-enforcement review simply by placing it in the Manual'\" and the \"VA Manual provision governing knee joint stability \u2026 announces VA\u2019s adoption of an interpretive rule establishing a new metric for assessing knee instability claims. It limits VA staff discretion, and, as a practical matter, impacts veteran benefits eligibility for an entire class of veterans.\"\nProminent M21-1 sections.\nSome sections of the M21-1 Manual have received significant attention from various groups such as investigatory bodies like the VA &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Inspector%20General\"&gt;Office of Inspector General&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"General%20Accountability%20Office\"&gt;General Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;, veterans service organizations, the press, Congress, and others.\nTelehealth and telemental health examinations.\nIn February 2020, the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VAOIG) issued an audit report titled, \"Telehealth Public-Use Questionnaires Were Used Improperly to Determine Disability Benefits\", which critiqued VBA's enforcement of the M21-1 Manual subsection titled, \"Examination Report Requirements: Telehealth and Telemental Health Examinations\".\nReorganization of the M21-1 Manual.\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) announced in May 2021 that they had initiated a reorganization of the M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual. In the cited VBA memorandum, the agency indicated that want to \u201c[make] the M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) a more consumable and navigable resource.\u201d"
