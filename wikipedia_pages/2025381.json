    "text": "Edward Peter \"Eddie\" Keher (; born 14 October 1941) is a retired Irish &lt;a href=\"Hurling\"&gt;hurler&lt;/a&gt; who played as a centre-forward for the &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20GAA\"&gt;Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt; senior team.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Inistioge\"&gt;Inistioge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Kilkenny\"&gt;County Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, Keher first played competitive hurling whilst at school in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kieran%27s%20College\"&gt;St. Kieran's College&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of fifteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut in the &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship%201959\"&gt;1959 championship&lt;/a&gt;. Keher went on to play a key part for Kilkenny over several seasons, and won six &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medals, ten &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medals and three &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;National Hurling League&lt;/a&gt; medals. An All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions, Keher also captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1969.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20GAA\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; inter-provincial team for sixteen years, Keher won nine &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Cup\"&gt;Railway Cup&lt;/a&gt; medals, a record for a Leinster player. At club level he won one &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; medal with &lt;a href=\"Rower-Inistioge%20GAA\"&gt;Rower-Inistioge&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeher's career tally of 35 goals and 336 points was a record score which stood until 20 June 2010 when it was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Shefflin\"&gt;Henry Shefflin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout his career Keher made 50 championship appearances, a Kilkenny record which stood until 25 July 2004 when it was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"D.%20J.%20Carey\"&gt;D. J. Carey&lt;/a&gt;. His retirement came following the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"1977%20All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;1977 championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn retirement from playing, Keher temporarily became involved in team management and coaching. As joint-coach to the Kilkenny senior team with &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Henderson\"&gt;Pat Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, he helped guide the team to the All-Ireland title in 1979.\nDuring his playing days, Keher won four &lt;a href=\"GAA%20All%20Stars%20Awards\"&gt;C\u00fa Chulainn&lt;/a&gt; awards and five &lt;a href=\"GAA%20All%20Stars%20Awards\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; awards, as well as being named &lt;a href=\"Texaco%20Hurler%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Texaco Hurler of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. He also met and tutored Muhammad Ali in hurling in 1972, when he visited Dublin. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at corner-forward on the &lt;a href=\"Hurling%20Team%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;Hurling Team of the Century&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 and the &lt;a href=\"Hurling%20Team%20of%20the%20Millennium\"&gt;Hurling Team of the Millennium&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.\nPlaying career.\nColleges.\nKeher attended the famous &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kieran%27s%20College%20%28Kilkenny%29\"&gt;St. Kieran's College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20%28city%29\"&gt;Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual nursery for young hurling talent.\nIn 1957 he was just fifteen years-old when he played a key part for the college in the provincial championship. A 6\u20133 to 3\u20130 defeat of Patrician College, &lt;a href=\"Ballyfin\"&gt;Ballyfin&lt;/a&gt; gave Keher his first &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Colleges%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 28 April 1957 saw St. Kieran's line out against &lt;a href=\"St.%20Flannan%27s%20College\"&gt;St. Flannan's College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ennis\"&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt;. Keher scored three goals in the second half to clinch victory, before setting up a fourth goal in a narrow 4\u20132 to 2\u20137 victory. It was his first &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Croke%20Cup\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal.\nSt. Kieran's continued their dominance in 1958, with Keher adding a second Leinster medal to his collection following a 10\u20134 to 3\u20134 thrashing of &lt;a href=\"Cistercian%20College%2C%20Roscrea\"&gt;Cistercian College&lt;/a&gt;, Roscrea.\nIn 1959 Keher was captain of the team. He won a third Leinster medal to his collection that year, after receiving a walkover in the final, before later lining out in the All-Ireland final on 19 April 1959. &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20CBS\"&gt;Abbey CBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20Town\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; provided the opposition, however, a 2\u201313 to 4\u20132 victory gave Keher a second All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Croke Cup as captain.\nClub.\nKeher played his club hurling with &lt;a href=\"Rower-Inistioge%20GAA\"&gt;Rower-Inistioge&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed much success.\nIn 1968 he lined out in his first senior championship decider. Three-in-a-row hopefuls &lt;a href=\"Bennettsbridge%20GAA\"&gt;Bennettsbridge&lt;/a&gt; provided the opposition and a close game followed. A narrow 3\u20139 to 3\u20137 victory gave Keher a &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship&lt;/a&gt; medal.\nMinor.\nKeher was just fifteen years-old when he was called up to the Kilkenny minor team in 1956. He won a &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medal as an unused substitute that year following a 4\u20137 to 3\u20137 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Wexford%20GAA\"&gt;Wexford&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1957 Keher added a second Leinster medal to his collection, as &lt;a href=\"Offaly%20GAA\"&gt;Offaly&lt;/a&gt; were defeated by 5\u201310 to 4\u20132. The subsequent All-Ireland final against &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20GAA\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; was a replay of the previous year, however, the game was much closer. Kilkenny were defeated once again, however, on a score line of 4\u20137 to 3\u20137.\nKilkenny retained their provincial crown in 1958, with Keher collecting a third Leinster medal following a 5\u201311 to 1\u20137 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Laois%20GAA\"&gt;Laois&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeher lined out for a fourth and final year in the minor grade in 1959. A 7\u20139 to 3\u20134 trouncing of Wexford gave him a fourth successive Leinster medal. He later lined out in a third All-Ireland final, with old rivals Tipperary providing the opposition once again. A narrow 2\u20138 to 2\u20137 defeat denied Keher an &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal once again, in what was his last game in the minor grade.\nSenior.\n1959\u20131964.\nAfter impressing against &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20GAA\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Oireachtas%20Tournament\"&gt;Oireachtas Cup&lt;/a&gt; and Wexford in the &lt;a href=\"Walsh%20Cup%20%28hurling%29\"&gt;Walsh Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Keher was included on the Kilkenny senior panel for the replay of the All-Ireland final against &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20GAA\"&gt;Waterford&lt;/a&gt; on 4 October 1959. After fifteen minutes he was introduced as a substitute for &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20McGovern\"&gt;Johnny McGovern&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced off after a recurrence of a shoulder injury he'd picked up in the drawn game. Kilkenny took an early six-point lead, however, two goals from &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Cheasty\"&gt;Tom Cheasty&lt;/a&gt; and a third from &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Flannelly\"&gt;Mick Flannelly&lt;/a&gt; gave Waterford a half-time lead. Kilkenny scored only two points in the second half, courtesy of Keher, and eventually succumbed to a 3\u201312 to 1\u201310 defeat.\nIn 1962 Keher was a regular member of the starting fifteen, and captured his first silverware when Kilkenny defeated &lt;a href=\"Cork%20GAA\"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt; to take their first &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;National Hurling League&lt;/a&gt; in almost thirty years.\nThe following year Keher won his first &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medal following a 2\u201310 to 0\u20139 defeat of Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly into an All-Ireland showdown with Waterford on 1 September 1963. \"The Cats\" entered the game as underdogs, however, Keher proved to be the difference with a magnificent display in which he scored fourteen points. Despite a hat-trick of goals from Waterford's &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9amus%20Power%20%28Waterford%20hurler%29\"&gt;S\u00e9amus Power&lt;/a&gt;, Kilkenny secured a 4\u201317 to 6\u20138 victory. It was Keher's first &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal. He later won his first C\u00fa Chulainn award in the inaugural year of the awards scheme.\nKeher added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1964 as Dublin were defeated on a 4\u201311 to 1\u20138 score line. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against fierce rivals Tipperary. &lt;a href=\"John%20McKenna%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;John McKenna&lt;/a&gt; scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1\u20138 to 0\u20136 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with &lt;a href=\"Donie%20Nealon\"&gt;Donie Nealon&lt;/a&gt; getting a hat-trick and &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20McLoughlin%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;Se\u00e1n McLoughlin&lt;/a&gt; another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5\u201313 to 2\u20138. In spite of this defeat Keher later collected a second C\u00fa Chulainn award.\n1965\u20131970.\nAfter surrendering their provincial crown in 1965, Kilkenny bounced back the following year by reaching the National league decider. An aggregate 10\u201315 to 2\u201315 defeat of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20GAA\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; gave Keher his second National League medal. He later won a third Leinster medal following a 1\u201315 to 2\u20136 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the favourites, however, two goals by &lt;a href=\"Colm%20Sheehan\"&gt;Colm Sheehan&lt;/a&gt; and a third from &lt;a href=\"John%20O%27Halloran\"&gt;John O'Halloran&lt;/a&gt; gave Cork a merited 3\u20139 to 1\u201310 victory. Keher later won a third C\u00fa Chulainn award.\nKilkenny retained their provincial crown in 1967, with Keher adding a fourth Leinster medal to his collection following a 4\u201310 to 1\u201312 defeat of Wexford after a scare in the opening half. 3 September 1967 saw Kilkenny face Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipp looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2\u20136 to 1\u20133 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Walsh\"&gt;Ollie Walsh&lt;/a&gt; was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Keher and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Walsh%20%28Thomastown%20hurler%29\"&gt;Tom Walsh&lt;/a&gt; to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3\u20138 to 2\u20137 victory gave Keher a second All-Ireland medal. He later won a fourth C\u00fa Chulainn award.\nWexford put an end to Kilkenny's hopes of retaining the title in 1968, however, the Noresiders bounced back the following year with Keher, who was now captain of the side, collecting a fifth Leinster medal following a 3\u20139 to 0\u201316 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Offaly%20GAA\"&gt;Offaly&lt;/a&gt;. 7 September 1969 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland decider. The Leesiders got into their stride following an early goal by &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20McCarthy%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;Charlie McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and led by six points coming up to half time when Kilkenny raised a green flag themselves. Kilkenny upped their performance after the interval and ran out winners on a 2\u201315 to 2\u20139 scoreline. The victory gave Keher a third All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of collecting the &lt;a href=\"Liam%20MacCarthy%20Cup\"&gt;Liam MacCarthy Cup&lt;/a&gt; as captain.\n1971\u20131977.\nAfter surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland crowns to Wexford the following year, Kilkenny began their complete dominance of the provincial championship in 1971. A 6\u201316 to 3\u201316 defeat of Wexford gave Keher his sixth Leinster medal. On 5 September 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, the first to be &lt;a href=\"Colour%20television\"&gt;broadcast in colour&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"RT%C3%89\"&gt;Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt; and the only eighty-minute meeting between the two sides. Kilkenny's ever-dependable goalkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Walsh\"&gt;Ollie Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, had a nightmare of a game in which he conceded five goals, one of which passed through his legs, while that year's Hurler of the Year, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keating%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;\"Babs\" Keating&lt;/a&gt;, played out the closing stages of the game in his bare feet. Keher set a new record by scoring 2\u201311, however, it wasn't enough as Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5\u201317 to 5\u201314. In spite of this defeat, Keher was later chosen on the inaugural &lt;a href=\"GAA%20GPA%20All%20Stars%20Awards\"&gt;All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; team.\nIn 1972 Keher won a seventh Leinster medal following a thrilling draw and replay victory over Wexford. Once again, Cork provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1972, a game which is often considered to be one of the classic games of the modern era. Halfway through the second-half Cork were on form and stretched their lead to eight points. Drastic action was required for Kilkenny and Keher was deployed closer to the Cork goal. One of the most abiding memories of that game is of Keher grabbing the sliotar out of the sky and racing up the wing in the shadow of the Hogan Stand. From that sideline position Keher pucked the sliotar as if going for a point, however, the sliotar dropped short, deceiving Cork goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Paddy%20Barry%20%28St.%20Vincent%27s%20hurler%29\"&gt;Paddy Barry&lt;/a&gt;, and ending up in the back of the net. After scoring that goal an almost emotionless Keher simply turned around to go back to his normal playing position with blood pouring out of a cut over his eye, having been hit by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Maher\"&gt;Tony Maher&lt;/a&gt;'s hurley. Keher finished the game with a tally of 2\u20139 and collected his fourth All-Ireland medal following a remarkable 3\u201324 to 5\u201311 victory. As well as collecting a second All-Star award, Keher was an automatic choice for &lt;a href=\"Texaco%20Hurler%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Texaco Hurler of the Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeher added an eighth Leinster medal to his collection following a 4\u201322 to 3\u201315 defeat of Wexford. His season later came to a premature end due to injury, and he missed Kilkenny's All-Ireland defeat by &lt;a href=\"Limerick%20GAA\"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of missing the latter stages of the championship, Keher collected a third All-Star award.\nWexford were, once again, narrowly defeated by Kilkenny in the 1974 provincial decider. The remarkable 6\u201313 to 2\u201324 victory gave Keher a ninth Leinster medal. In a repeat of the previous year Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1974. The Munster champions stormed to a five-point lead in the first eleven minutes, however, a converted penalty by Keher, supplemented by two further goals gave Kilkenny a 3\u201319 to 1\u201313 victory and gave Keher a fifth All-Ireland medal. He later won a fourth All-Star award.\nKilkenny made it five successive provincial titles in-a-row in 1975. The 2\u201320 to 2\u201314 defeat of Wexford gave Keher his tenth Leinster medal. On 7 September 1975, Keher lined out in an impressive tenth All-Ireland final, with surprise semi-final winners &lt;a href=\"Galway%20GAA\"&gt;Galway&lt;/a&gt; providing the opposition. Playing with the wind in the first half, Galway found themselves ahead by 0\u20139 to 1\u20133 at the interval. Keher's huge tally of 2\u20137 kept Galway at bay giving Kilkenny a 2\u201322 to 2\u201310 victory. Keher had once again powered his team to an All-Ireland victory, his sixth overall. He later added a fifth successive All-Star award to his collection.\nIn 1976 Kilkenny looked a sure bet to capture a third successive All-Ireland crown. The season began well with Keher winning a third National League medal following a 6\u201314 to 1\u201314 trouncing of &lt;a href=\"Clare%20GAA\"&gt;Clare&lt;/a&gt; in a replay. Kilkenny's championship ambitions unravelled in spectacular fashion in the subsequent provincial campaign, when a 2\u201320 to 1\u20136 trouncing by Wexford dumped Keher's team out of the championship.\nKeher played his last championship game for Kilkenny on 24 July 1977. The narrow 3\u201317 to 3\u201314 defeat by Wexford in the Leinster decider brought Kilkenny's championship to an end.\nInter-provincial.\nKeher also lind out with &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20GAA\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; in the inter-provincial series of games, and enjoyed much success during a seventeen-year career.\nAfter making his debut in 1961, it would take another three years before Keher enjoyed any success. A 3\u20137 to 2\u20139 defeat of archrivals &lt;a href=\"Munster%20GAA\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; gave him a &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Cup\"&gt;Railway Cup&lt;/a&gt; medal. Leinster made it two-in-a-row the following year, with Keher collecting a second Railway Cup medal following a 3\u201311 to 0\u20139 defeat of Munster.\nThree-in-a-row proved beyond Leinster, however, Keher won a third Railway Cup medal in 1967 following a 2\u201314 to 3\u20135 defeat of Munster once again.\nAfter several years of Munster dominance, Leinster bounced back in 1971. The team went on to secure five consecutive Railway Cup victories over Munster. Keher played a key role in all of these wins, and ended his career with nine Railway Cup medals, a record for a Leinster player.\nManagerial career.\nIn retirement from playing Keher became involved in team management and coaching.\nHe teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Henderson\"&gt;Pat Henderson&lt;/a&gt; to take charge of the Kilkenny senior hurling team in 1979. It was a successful year for the duo as Kilkenny qualified for the provincial decider. A 2\u201321 to 2\u201317 defeat of Wexford secured the Leinster crown. Galway provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1979, however, the game turned out to be one of the least exciting finals of the decade. A goal by &lt;a href=\"Noel%20Lane%20%28Galway%20hurler%29\"&gt;Noel Lane&lt;/a&gt; after forty-seven minutes gave Galway a two-point lead, however, Galway failed to score for the rest of the game. Kilkenny, on the other hand, scored two long-range goals to secure a 2\u201312 to 1\u20138 victory. This victory gave Keher and Henderson All-Ireland victories as both players and as coaches.\nIn 1987 Keher took charge of the Kilkenny team on his own for one season. It was an unsuccessful period as Kilkenny exited the provincial championship at an early stage.\nControversy.\nIn 2010 Keher was highly critical of Cork goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Donal%20%C3%93g%20Cusack\"&gt;Donal \u00d3g Cusack&lt;/a&gt;'s autobiography, \"Come What May\". After taking umbrage to the description of the Kilkenny team as the &lt;a href=\"Stepford%20Wives\"&gt;Stepford Wives&lt;/a&gt; of hurling, Keher insisted that Cusack's criticisms were unjustified and stated that if he had received a present of the best-seller last Christmas, it would have gone \"straight in the bin.\"\nFollowing the drawn All-Ireland final between Kilkenny and Galway in 2012, Keher became involved in a war-of-words with &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Canning\"&gt;Joe Canning&lt;/a&gt; following his comments about Herny Shefflin's sportsmanship. Keher said, \"I think that's a very disappointing comment to make about probably one of the greatest hurlers to ever play the game, and a thorough gentleman at that. We'd hate in Kilkenny to have someone of the stature of Joe Canning making a remark like that\".\nRecognition.\n&lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Maher\"&gt;Fr. Tommy Maher&lt;/a&gt;, trainer of seven All-Ireland-winning Kilkenny teams, said of him in 1975: \"At this stage, I must say Eddie Keher is the greatest I've seen. The second greatest was &lt;a href=\"Christy%20Ring\"&gt;Christy Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Up until last year, perhaps, I would have reversed that order. But I have no doubt at all now, because Keher has done so much for the game, has played it so brilliantly, scores so brilliantly and at all times then a thorough gentleman \u2013 a credit to the game.'.\nSeven years after his retirement from playing, Keher received the ultimate honour during the GAA's centenary year in 1984 when he was chosen at left corner-forward on the &lt;a href=\"Hurling%20Team%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;Hurling Team of the Century&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of only a handful of players from the \"modern era\" to be listed on the team. Keher swapped to the right corner-forward position on the &lt;a href=\"Hurling%20Team%20of%20the%20Millennium\"&gt;Hurling Team of the Millennium&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, while he was also named on a special Kilkenny Team of the Century.\nIn 2005 Keher was inducted into the Irish Independent/Jury's Ballsbridge Hotel Hall of Fame.\nThe following year Keher received an honorary doctorate of science from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Limerick\"&gt;University of Limerick&lt;/a&gt;. The university marked \"the achievement of this remarkable hurling legend who is also well-known for his work with young people and in humanitarian causes.\"\nNearly forty years after winning the Texaco Hurler of the Year award, Keher was the recipient of the 2009 Texaco Sportstars Hall of Fame Award.\nIn May 2020, the \"&lt;a href=\"Irish%20Independent\"&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/a&gt;\" named Keher at number four in its \"Top 20 hurlers in Ireland over the past 50 years\".\nPersonal life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Inistioge\"&gt;Inistioge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Kilkenny\"&gt;County Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, Keher was the second child born to Stephen and Noreen Keher (n\u00e9e Browne). His father, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na\"&gt;Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na&lt;/a&gt;, was a native of Donamon and had played &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20football\"&gt;Gaelic football&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Roscommon%20GAA\"&gt;Roscommon&lt;/a&gt;, before later lining out with Kilkenny.\nKeher learned the art of hurling at the local national school in Inistioge. Regular evening matches were played between Inistioge's \"up streets\" and \"down streets\", or between children from the village and the surrounding countryside. In 1952 the eleven-year-old Keher played for the school when they won the under-14 Roinn B championship.
