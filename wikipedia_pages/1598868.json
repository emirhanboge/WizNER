    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the digit sum of a &lt;a href=\"natural%20number\"&gt;natural number&lt;/a&gt; in a given &lt;a href=\"number%20base\"&gt;number base&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"summation\"&gt;sum&lt;/a&gt; of all its &lt;a href=\"numerical%20digit\"&gt;digit&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, the digit sum of the &lt;a href=\"decimal%20number\"&gt;decimal number&lt;/a&gt; formula_1 would be formula_2.\nDefinition.\nLet formula_3 be a natural number. We define the digit sum for base formula_4 formula_5 to be the following:\nwhere formula_7 is the number of digits in the number in base formula_8, and\nis the value of each digit of the number. \nFor example, in base 10, the digit sum of 84001 is formula_10.\nFor any two bases formula_11 and for sufficiently large natural numbers formula_3,\nThe sum of the &lt;a href=\"base%2010\"&gt;base 10&lt;/a&gt; digits of the integers 0, 1, 2, ... is given by in the &lt;a href=\"On-Line%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Integer%20Sequences\"&gt;On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences&lt;/a&gt;. use the &lt;a href=\"generating%20function\"&gt;generating function&lt;/a&gt; of this integer sequence (and of the analogous sequence for binary digit sums) to derive several rapidly converging &lt;a href=\"series%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"rational%20number\"&gt;rational&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"transcendental%20number\"&gt;transcendental&lt;/a&gt; sums.\nExtension to negative integers.\nThe digit sum can be extended to the negative integers by use of a &lt;a href=\"signed-digit%20representation\"&gt;signed-digit representation&lt;/a&gt; to represent each integer.\nApplications.\nThe concept of a decimal digit sum is closely related to, but not the same as, the &lt;a href=\"digital%20root\"&gt;digital root&lt;/a&gt;, which is the result of repeatedly applying the digit sum operation until the remaining value is only a single digit. The digital root of any non-zero integer will be a number in the range 1 to 9, whereas the digit sum can take any value. Digit sums and digital roots can be used for quick &lt;a href=\"divisibility%20rule\"&gt;divisibility tests&lt;/a&gt;: a natural number is divisible by 3 or 9 if and only if its digit sum (or digital root) is divisible by 3 or 9, respectively. For divisibility by 9, this test is called the rule of nines and is the basis of the &lt;a href=\"casting%20out%20nines\"&gt;casting out nines&lt;/a&gt; technique for checking calculations.\nDigit sums are also a common ingredient in &lt;a href=\"checksum\"&gt;checksum&lt;/a&gt; algorithms to check the arithmetic operations of early computers. Earlier, in an era of hand calculation, suggested using sums of 50 digits taken from mathematical tables of &lt;a href=\"logarithm\"&gt;logarithm&lt;/a&gt;s as a form of &lt;a href=\"random%20number%20generation\"&gt;random number generation&lt;/a&gt;; if one assumes that each digit is random, then by the &lt;a href=\"central%20limit%20theorem\"&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/a&gt;, these digit sums will have a random distribution closely approximating a &lt;a href=\"Gaussian%20distribution\"&gt;Gaussian distribution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe digit sum of the &lt;a href=\"Binary%20numeral%20system\"&gt;binary&lt;/a&gt; representation of a number is known as its &lt;a href=\"Hamming%20weight\"&gt;Hamming weight&lt;/a&gt; or population count; algorithms for performing this operation have been studied, and it has been included as a built-in operation in some computer architectures and some programming languages. These operations are used in computing applications including &lt;a href=\"cryptography\"&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coding%20theory\"&gt;coding theory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"computer%20chess\"&gt;computer chess&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Harshad%20number\"&gt;Harshad number&lt;/a&gt;s are defined in terms of divisibility by their digit sums, and &lt;a href=\"Smith%20number\"&gt;Smith number&lt;/a&gt;s are defined by the equality of their digit sums with the digit sums of their &lt;a href=\"integer%20factorization\"&gt;prime factorizations&lt;/a&gt;."
