    "text": "George Scratchley Brown (17 August 1918 \u2013 5 December 1978) was a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"General%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; who served as the eighth &lt;a href=\"chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt;. In this capacity, he served as the senior military adviser to the &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;president of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Security%20Council\"&gt;National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20Defense\"&gt;secretary of defense&lt;/a&gt;. Through the commanders of the unified and specified commands, he was also responsible for executing the decisions of the National Command Authorities regarding worldwide readiness and employment of combat forces of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt;, Air Force and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Scratchley Brown was born in &lt;a href=\"Montclair%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Montclair, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, on 17 August 1918, the son of Thoburn Kaye Brown, an Army officer who had graduated with the &lt;a href=\"West%20Point\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt; class of 1913, and his wife Frances Katherine n\u00e9e Scratchley. As an &lt;a href=\"Army%20brat\"&gt;Army brat&lt;/a&gt;, Brown lived in a succession of different towns and military bases. He was an &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29\"&gt;Eagle Scout&lt;/a&gt;, and played on the &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"varsity%20team\"&gt;varsity team&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"freshman\"&gt;freshman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Brown%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Fort Brown, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. He later was a &lt;a href=\"Fullback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt; during his junior and senior years at &lt;a href=\"Immaculata%20High%20School%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;Immaculata High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Leavenworth%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Fort Leavenworth, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, and was an all-league in the Catholic high school interstate league.\nBoth Brown and his younger brother Tim set their sights on attending West Point, but their father advised taking a year of college first. Therefore, after graduating from high school in 1936, Brown enrolled in engineering at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Missouri\"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; where he joined &lt;a href=\"Sigma%20Alpha%20Epsilon\"&gt;Sigma Alpha Epsilon&lt;/a&gt;. A fine horseman, he played &lt;a href=\"polo\"&gt;polo&lt;/a&gt;. He also enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"128th%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;128th Field Artillery Battalion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20National%20Guard\"&gt;Missouri National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, rising to the rank of &lt;a href=\"corporal\"&gt;corporal&lt;/a&gt;. His father was able to secure a congressional appointment to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;United States Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; for him, and Brown entered on 1 July 1937.\nAt West Point, Brown was roommates with &lt;a href=\"John%20Norton%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;John Norton&lt;/a&gt;, future &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20general\"&gt;lieutenant general&lt;/a&gt;. Brown once again played polo, and was captain of the team in his senior year, when the West Point team lost in the final to &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;. In that year he was also cadet captain and regimental adjutant. He would have liked to have joined the &lt;a href=\"Cavalry%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt; on graduation like his father, but his standing as 342nd in his class was too low for an appointment to the cavalry. Instead, he was commissioned as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the infantry on graduation on 11 June 1941. However, he volunteered for &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps\"&gt;Air Corps&lt;/a&gt; training. At West Point he met Alice (Skip) Colhoun. An Army brat like himself, Alice met Brown at a party her father had thrown for the sons of the graduates of the class of 1913. Brown and Alice dated for over a year, and were married in 1942. Their marriage produced three children, two boys and a girl.\nWorld War II.\nBrown commenced his basic flight training in &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20PT-19\"&gt;Fairchild PT-19&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Grider%20Field\"&gt;Pine Bluff, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; on 20 August 1941. He then went to &lt;a href=\"Randolph%20Field%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Randolph Field, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, for the second phase of his training. The third and final phase was completed at &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Field%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Kelly Field, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where he received his pilot's wings on 7 March 1942. He officially transferred to the Air Corps on 4 April 1942, and was promoted to &lt;a href=\"first%20lieutenant\"&gt;first lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; on 18 June 1942. His first assignment after flight training was at &lt;a href=\"Barksdale%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Barksdale Field, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"344th%20Bombardment%20Squadron\"&gt;344th Bombardment Squadron&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"93d%20Air-Ground%20Operations%20Wing\"&gt;93d Bombardment Group&lt;/a&gt;, he flew the &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator\"&gt;Consolidated B-24 Liberator&lt;/a&gt;. Moving with the organization to &lt;a href=\"Page%20Field\"&gt;Fort Myers, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, he flew both antisubmarine patrol and conventional bomber training aircraft.\nIn August 1942, he flew with the 93d Bombardment Group to England, where it became the first B-24 group to join the &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Eighth Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. He served in various positions with the group, including commander of the &lt;a href=\"329th%20Bombardment%20Squadron\"&gt;329th Bombardment Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, group operations officer and group executive officer. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28land%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; on 20 October, &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; on 13 February 1943, and &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt; on 27 August 1943. High casualties and the rapid expansion of the Air Force paved the way for fast promotion, which Brown's superiors felt was deserved due to his outstanding performance in combat and leadership skills. Perhaps no one was as surprised at his rapid advance in rank as his father, now a &lt;a href=\"brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt;, who was serving in North Africa at the time Brown arrived there with the 93d Bombardment Group when it was temporarily detached from the Eighth Air Force. The elder Brown wanted to know \"What's a young whippersnapper like you doing as a colonel?!\"\nIt was as executive officer that he took part in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Tidal%20Wave\"&gt;Operation Tidal Wave&lt;/a&gt;, the low-level bombing raid against oil refineries at &lt;a href=\"Ploie%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Ploie\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;, Romania, on 1 August 1943. The 93d Bombardment Group was the second of five B-24 groups that raided Ploie\u015fti from a temporary base at &lt;a href=\"Benghazi\"&gt;Benghazi&lt;/a&gt;, Libya. It flew directly into heavy defenses to attack three of the six target refineries. The lead plane, flown by the group commander, Lieutenant Colonel &lt;a href=\"Addison%20Baker\"&gt;Addison Baker&lt;/a&gt;, was shot down. Brown took over the command of the battered 93d and led it through the attack on the target and the journey back to Benghazi. He received the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Distinguished Service Cross&lt;/a&gt; for his actions on that mission. For his services in combat in the skies over Europe, he was also awarded the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Star\"&gt;Silver Star&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Distinguished Flying Crosses&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Air%20Medal\"&gt;Air Medal&lt;/a&gt;s, the French &lt;a href=\"Croix%20de%20guerre%201939%E2%80%931945\"&gt;Croix de guerre&lt;/a&gt; with palm and the British &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Distinguished Flying Cross&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrown was appointed assistant operations officer, 2d Air Division on 8 April 1944. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; on 1 October. Having completed the required 25 missions, he was rotated back to the United States on 9 November. Alice was shocked to discover \"that guy of mine had in fact requested another overseas assignment. He was so gung ho that he had come home, checked on me, and without my knowing it, put in to go back for another tour.\" However, the Air Force turned down the request. On 27 January 1945, Brown became Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff A-3 with the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Training%20Command\"&gt;Air Training Command&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Carswell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nCold War and later career.\nIn February 1946, Brown was posted to the Operations Division of the Air Training Command at &lt;a href=\"Barksdale%20Field%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Barksdale Field, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where he served under &lt;a href=\"Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20C.%20Kincaid\"&gt;Alvin C. Kincaid&lt;/a&gt; and his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, Brigadier General &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20C.%20Darcy\"&gt;Thomas C. Darcy&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, Brown received a mediocre effectiveness report. In December 1946 he joined Headquarters &lt;a href=\"Air%20Defense%20Command\"&gt;Air Defense Command&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mitchel%20Field%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Mitchel Field, New York&lt;/a&gt;, as assistant to Air Chief of Staff, Operations, and later as chief of its &lt;a href=\"ROTC\"&gt;ROTC&lt;/a&gt; branch. On 1 July 1947 he became assistant deputy for operations.\nBrown became commander of the &lt;a href=\"62d%20Airlift%20Wing\"&gt;62d Troop Carrier Group&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"McChord%20Air%20Force%20Base%2C%20Washington\"&gt;McChord Air Force Base, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, on 17 July 1950. This group operated &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20C-124%20Globemaster%20II\"&gt;Douglas C-124 Globemaster II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20C-119%20Flying%20Boxcar\"&gt;Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar&lt;/a&gt; aircraft between the West Coast and Japan. With the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; in June 1950, this mission acquired great importance. In July 1951 he assumed command of the &lt;a href=\"56th%20Fighter%20Interceptor%20Wing\"&gt;56th Fighter Interceptor Wing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Selfridge%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Selfridge Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Air Defense Command, although he had never flown fighters before. He learned to fly the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20T-33%20Shooting%20Star\"&gt;Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre\"&gt;North American F-86 Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20F-94%20Starfire\"&gt;Lockheed F-94 Starfire&lt;/a&gt;.

He entered the &lt;a href=\"National%20War%20College\"&gt;National War College&lt;/a&gt; in August 1956. It was the first and only service school he attended after graduating from West Point. After graduation in June 1957, he served as executive to the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20D.%20White\"&gt;Thomas D.

It was staffed by personnel of all three services. In May 1966 he became the Assistant to the &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt;, General &lt;a href=\"Earle%20G.%20Wheeler\"&gt;Earle G. Wheeler&lt;/a&gt;, on the recommendation of his predecessor in the role, Lieutenant General &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Goodpaster\"&gt;Andrew Goodpaster&lt;/a&gt;. Brown was promoted to the same rank on 1 August 1966. The preoccupation of the Joint Chiefs at this time was the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;, but he was also involved in the handling of the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Pueblo%20%28AGER-2%29\"&gt;\"Pueblo\" crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 1 August 1968, Brown assumed command of the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Seventh Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and also became deputy commander for air operations, U.S. &lt;a href=\"Military%20Assistance%20Command%20Vietnam\"&gt;Military Assistance Command Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; (MACV), with the rank of general.

In his MACV position, he advised on all matters pertaining to tactical air support and coordinated the Republic of Vietnam and United States air operations in the MACV area of responsibility. According to Goodpaster, Brown and MACV commander General &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20Abrams\"&gt;Creighton Abrams&lt;/a&gt; \"were like two brothers\". General &lt;a href=\"George%20F.%20Keegan\"&gt;George F. Keegan&lt;/a&gt; felt that:\nBrown's tour of Vietnam ended in September 1970, and he became Commander, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20Systems%20Command\"&gt;Air Force Systems Command&lt;/a&gt;, with headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Andrews%20Air%20Force%20Base%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. This job involved handling a number of troublesome projects, including the &lt;a href=\"F-111\"&gt;F-111&lt;/a&gt;.\nChief of Staff of the United States Air Force.\nIn 1973, under the recommendation of the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20the%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Secretary of the Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Seamans\"&gt;Robert Seamans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20R.%20Schlesinger\"&gt;James R. Schlesinger&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; appointed Brown to be Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, effective 1 August 1973. General Brown became the first &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Air Force chief of staff&lt;/a&gt; who had previously never held the position of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Air Force vice chief of staff&lt;/a&gt;. Brown was successful in building his character and leadership, mostly during his time as a &lt;a href=\"General%20officer\"&gt;general officer&lt;/a&gt;, and his tenure at several high-ranking positions had made him the favored choice for higher position within the military for quite some time. According to Brown biography book \"Destined for Stars\" written by Edgar F. Puryear, Jr. several high-ranking people within the military and government officials had predicted that Brown someday would achieved a higher position within the military, such as Brown predecessor General John D. Ryan who informed Brown that he was his favorite choice to succeed him as Air Force Chief of Staff after Ryan assumed the Air Force Chief of Staff position in August 1969. \nGeneral George S. Brown was sworn in as the eighth &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; on August 1, 1973. In this capacity Brown oversaw all United States major operations both domestic and international and all Air Force related projects, such as the development of the new fighter and bomber aircraft project which resulted in the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and the B-1B strategic bomber aircraft. Brown emphasized the need of the modernization of United States Air Force Aircraft fleet following the Vietnam War and for the long-term future, in-order to deterred the growing Soviet weapon arsenal. Brown also emphasized the importance role of Strategic Air Command as United States primary nuclear deterrence. Brown also emphasize the need of a new and modern missile that could strengthen the ballistic-missile as part of the Nuclear Triad, as a result the Air Force began the development of the new &lt;a href=\"LGM-118%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;MX missiles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff, Brown also wanted to create a new and different relationship with his fellow Air Force personnel, unlike his predecessor and asking them for not hesitate to suggest him a new ideas for the Air Force. One of Brown primary focus in reshaping and modernize the Air Force, is that not only focusing on the aircraft, weapons and material, but also with its own personnel and people within the Air Force especially the morale and spiritual welfare. During his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff Brown also asked all the personnel to participate at all major religion event, such as the prayer for the release of the U.S. Military personnel that was held as Prisoner of War (POW) in Vietnam. During the Worldwide Commanders' Conference, Brown also called upon the personnel for a prayer on every occasion. Brown also often visited Air Force facility such as the Lackland Air Force Base where the new Airmen get its training and greeted them and joining them for lunch, which was depicted in the Air Force Now Movies series. Brown keep and maintained his relations with every Air Force personnel and didn't put gap between him and other air force personnel including the junior personnel. \nAn avid Aviator, Brown always spend every-time in Aircraft Cockpit as its pilot and despite his busy schedule and time-consuming duties as Air Force Chief of Staff, General Brown always maintained his primary interest and proficiency as a Pilot. At one occasion Brown always flew the Air Force Aircraft that was use primarily for official trips such as &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20JetStar\"&gt;Lockheed VC-140B Jetstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Sabreliner\"&gt;North American T-39 Sabreliner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20C-135%20Stratolifter\"&gt;Boeing C-135 Speckled Trout&lt;/a&gt;. At some point when Brown was on official trips with Senator &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Goldwater\"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt; who was also a Major General within the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20Reserve%20Command\"&gt;United States Air Force Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and an avid Aviator himself, Brown flew together in the cockpit with Senator Barry Goldwater. \nHowever, Brown did not remain as Air Force Chief of Staff for long. He was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff effective 1 July 1974. When Brown was nominated as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, many Air Force personnel feel sad that Brown have to leave the Air Force to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation's highest-ranking military position, due to many Air Force personnel feel that Brown was deeply needed within the Air Force. Brown was considered by many of the Air Force personnel as the \"Brain\" of the Air Force who brought so many idea and contribution within the Air Force that eventually led to the modernization of the Air Force.\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nIn 1974, following the Admiral &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Hinman%20Moorer\"&gt;Thomas Moorer&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for retirement as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Brown was tapped by President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; and Secretary of Defense &lt;a href=\"James%20R.%20Schlesinger\"&gt;James Schlesinger&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Moorer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many including former Secretary of Defense &lt;a href=\"Robert%20McNamara\"&gt;Robert McNamara&lt;/a&gt; whom Brown once work with as his military assistant has predicted that Brown would someday be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to General &lt;a href=\"Robert%20J.%20Dixon\"&gt;Robert J. Dixon&lt;/a&gt; who once served and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Air Force Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20D.%20White\"&gt;Thomas D. White&lt;/a&gt;, when White was lying ill in the hospital due to terminal leukemia in 1964, General White tell General Dixon to congratulate George S. Brown on behalf of General White if someday Brown becomes Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A prophecy of General Thomas D. White which eventually become true ten years later and what was also told on Brown Biography book \"Destined for Stars\" written by Edgar F. Puryear, Jr.\nGeorge S. Brown was sworn-in as &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt; is sworn-in as Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff by Department of Defense General Counsel Martin Hoffman in a ceremony held in &lt;a href=\"The%20Pentagon\"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, 1974 which was attend by Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and President Richard Nixon. In this capacity, Brown is now the highest-ranking and most senior military officer within the United States Armed Forces and is also the principal military advisor to the President, Secretary of Defense and the national Security Council. Brown also become the first Air Force General to held the position Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, following the 14 years hiatus of Air Force General within the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff position, since General &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20F.%20Twining\"&gt;Nathan F. Twining&lt;/a&gt; retired as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on August 15, 1960.\nHowever not long after Brown assuming the &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt; position, President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; who appointed Brown as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to resign from the presidency due to the Watergate Scandal and was succeeded by his Vice President &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Ford\"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; who assumed the presidency following Nixon resignation. Brown attended Nixon departure at the White House Lawn on August 9, 1974, as well as Gerald Ford inauguration Ceremony as President.\nAs Chairman, Brown was responsible for handling notable international event such as &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20invasion%20of%20Cyprus\"&gt;Turkish invasion of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, and the &lt;a href=\"Mayaguez%20incident\"&gt;\"Mayaguez\" incident&lt;/a&gt;, the final act of the war in Vietnam in 1975. He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and &lt;a href=\"Axe%20Murder%20Incident\"&gt;Axe Murder Incident&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone\"&gt;Korean Demilitarized Zone&lt;/a&gt;, and oversaw the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Treaty\"&gt;Panama Canal Treaty&lt;/a&gt; in 1977.One of Brown primary duties as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was the recasting and reshaping of the leadership within the Joint Staff. One of Brown primary action as in reshaping the leadership within the Joint Staff was by eliminating the J-2 which was basically responsible for communications function and combining it with the J-3 operations. Brown also gave a chance to his fellow Joint Chiefs of Staff members such as the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Army Chief of Staff to handle crisis situation, in-order to prepare them in-case they were chose to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One notable cases is during the &lt;a href=\"Mayaguez%20incident\"&gt;Mayaguez Incident&lt;/a&gt;, in-which at that time Brown was on official foreign trips to attend NATO summit in Europe, in-which at that time Brown allowed Air Force Chief of Staff General David C. Jones to act as the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and led the discussion within the National Security Council on the military planning and military matters to execute the operations to save the crew of &lt;a href=\"SS%20Mayaguez\"&gt;SS Mayaguez&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Jones later-on was appointed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, succeeding Brown in 1978 and Jones experience as acting-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Mayaguez Incident that led to Jones effort to modernize the scope of the military to improve its relations with the civilian leadership that eventually led to the Military Reform act in 1986 that was famously known as the Goldwater-Nichols Act. \nBrown also asserted the importance of military modernization following the Vietnam War and to prepare for the modern challenge, including the modernization of Air Force aircraft fleet and continuing Brown's policy during his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff. Brown described Soviet as a \"clear and present danger\" and believes that the Soviet is trying to buildup its military arsenal. Brown also assert that in-order to prepare for the worst case scenario such as event like \"First Strike\" the United States therefore must be ready at anytime and any-event and would eventually deter whatever worst-case situation that eventually will come-up in the future. Part of this Brown continue his effort to buildup the Strategic Air Command Nuclear Triad arsenal that Brown already started during his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff and emphasize the need of a new and modern bomber aircraft such as the B-1B Strategic Bomber Aircraft and the new MX Intercontinental Ballistic-Missile. Together with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger Brown began the study and development for a new and sophisticated weapon to deter any possible threat in the future. However following the new D\u00e9tente policy that was adopted in the early 1970's, Brown also adjust how to keep the United States Military always in robust shape and always ready all the time while following the D\u00e9tente policy. Part of the D\u00e9tente policy was the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks treaty or also known as SALT treaty which has already started in 1972, two years before Brown assuming the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Position. Working together with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, Brown re-assert that although both United States and Soviet are began to talk for D\u00e9tente and SALT treaty but always still be ready at anytime and to prevent an event that eventually could lead to a major crisis and escalate the tension between United States and the Soviet Union. \nIn November 1975, following &lt;a href=\"James%20R.%20Schlesinger\"&gt;James Schlesinger&lt;/a&gt; retirement as Secretary of Defense and was replace by Donald Rumsfeld, Brown worked together with Rumsfeld to re-assert United States policy on military buildup and D\u00e9tente. Both Rumsfeld and Brown agreed to worked on to speed-up the B-1B Bombers Program in-order to make B-1B Bomber Aircraft ready for service within the United States Air Force as soon as possible. Together with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Brown tested the B-1B Aircraft on a flight-test in 1975 along with Rumsfeld. Another part that Brown and Rumsfeld agreed was the new Fighter Aircraft program to modernize Air Force Tactical-Fighter Aircraft and to replace some Air Force aircraft that was considered obsolete. As a result the Air Force finally receive the new Tactical-Fighter Aircraft, F-15 and F-16, although the program has been studied during Brown's tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff along with Air Force Secretary &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Seamans\"&gt;Robert Seamans&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the SALT I Treaty Talk in 1972, the Ford administration which continued the Nixon Administration D\u00e9tente policy began the SALT II Treaty Talk. Ford tried to had the SALT II Treaty Talk before the 1976 Presidential Election and ask the Defense Department to immediately come-up with the important point for the SALT II Treaty. Together with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Brown worked together to develop the important point for SALT II Treaty. However the SALT II Treaty important points doesn't came-up due to several disagreement and failed to meet its deadline before the 1976 election. The Treaty eventually sign in 1979 during the Carter administration. \nBrown who was known for speaking frankly and forthright eventually causing some of his speech got heavily criticized during his term as Chairman. The event happened when Brown commented on two occasions\u2014firstly to a &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; audience in October 1974, and then to a French reporter in 1976\u2014that &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; was becoming a burden to &lt;a href=\"the%20Pentagon\"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; and that he believed the reason for continual military aid was due to Jews having control over America's banks, newspapers and elected officials. His exact words were:\nBrown's comments at Duke and subsequent reprimand by President &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Ford\"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; were reported on the front page of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" on 13 and 14 November 1974. There was speculation that Brown would be asked to resign, or at least not be nominated for a second two-year term; but he was renominated and went on to serve under the new president, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Carter\"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn April 1976 during an interview with &lt;a href=\"Ranan%20Lurie\"&gt;Ranan Lurie&lt;/a&gt;, a cartoonist for \"&lt;a href=\"Newsweek\"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;\" Magazine, Brown was Asked to comment on his opinion of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;British Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, Brown replied, \"They're no longer a world power. All they've got are generals, admirals and bands.\" Reaction in Britain was mixed. Some, like &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Allenby%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Allenby\"&gt;Lord Allenby&lt;/a&gt; condemned Brown's remarks, while others, like &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Monckton%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Monckton%20of%20Brenchley\"&gt;Lord Monckton&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the truth of the remarks. Brown also said that Israel was a \"burden\" to the United States, and predicted that Iran would become an important military power in the Middle East. The event that cause a sparked of controversy especially in the middle of Presidential Election was eventually resolved by Secretary of Defense &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Rumsfeld\"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; and Brown himself who immediately apologize for the remark. Both Brown and Rumsfeld held a press conference in The Pentagon to reaffirm that the statement was actually a mistake. Some even speculated that the statement was actually leaked by the opposition site to take advantage during the election, in-which Brown replied to the reporter that \"I'm not in a position to Judge\" and Rumsfeld also replied \"He's not in a position to judge, he's exactly right I agree with him completely.\" \nEvacuation of Saigon.\nOne of the most important event during Brown tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was the evacuation of Saigon following North Vietnamese troops managed to defeat South Vietnamese troops and occupy almost many of the South Vietnamese cities and continue to march through Saigon, the capital city of South Vietnam. Brown advised the National Security Council by the end of March 1975 that the United States should began the evacuation of American citizen that still left in Saigon and another South Vietnam cities immediately. Brown eventually oversaw the Military operations to evacuate U.S. Citizen in Saigon. He organized the military tactical airlift aircraft in-coordination with Air Force Chief of Staff General David C. Jones to evacuate American Citizen as soon as possible out of Saigon. The operations also involved several commercial aircraft to accelerate the evacuation. The operation was focused on &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Son%20Nhat%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Tan Son Nhat Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Saigon which was the only primary airport left in South Vietnam following the Da Nang cities fall to North Vietnamese Army. One of Brown message to all Military personnel involved in the operations was not to left anyone behind. \nHowever on 28 April 1975, Tan Son Nhat Airport came under heavy artillery fire and attack from North Vietnamese Air Force that eventually crippled the Airport. Brown therefore briefed President Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and the National Security Council on how to continue the evacuation following the attack on Tan Son Nhat Airport and since no more airport left behind on territory that still under South Vietnamese jurisdiction. Brown and the Joint Staff finally came-up with the idea of evacuation that primarily involved a flight with Helicopter. As a result Operation Frequent Wind was initiated from 29 April to 30 April 1975. The operation managed to evacuate as many people out of Saigon by flying them with Helicopters to a nearby United States Aircraft carrier on South China Sea. A CIA operated Airline, Air America also involved during the Operation Frequent Wind and deploy much of their Huey Helicopter fleet. The operation end on the morning of April 30, 1975 following the evacuation of U.S. Ambassador Graham Martin and the last U.S. Marine personnel in Saigon. \nCarter Administration.\nFollowing Gerald Ford defeat in 1976 Presidential election and Jimmy Carter assuming the presidency on January 20th, 1977, General George S. Brown remained to served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Carter Presidency. Before Carter assuming the Presidency, Brown along with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld already briefed the incoming Carter administration National Security team including Carter appointed Secretary of Defense Harold Brown about all of the important policy that's been take during Ford administration and shall be continue under Carter administration such as the SALT II Treaty Talk. Brown and Rumsfeld also gave Carter and his incoming National Security team of The Pentagon in December 1976. Brown and Carter new Secretary of Defense Harold Brown worked together on a military policy especially the incoming SALT II Treaty and the continuation of D\u00e9tente policy.However there's been some differences take on military matters between Ford and Carter administration in-which Brown disagreed with some of it such as Carter campaigned on a pledge to make the Pentagon more efficient, which led to the cancellation of some of importance military modernization program. As a result the B-1B Program whom Brown is strongly support it, was cancelled under the Carter Administration. Brown also strongly opposed Carter decision to withdraw the United States Military from South Korea May 1977. But at some point Carter and Harold Brown did also agreed with Brown about the importance role of Strategic Air Command as the nations primary nuclear deterrence. Both Carter and General brown agreed that it was only Strategic Air Command that can anticipate and deter the incoming attack from United States adversary that was known as \"First Strike\" especially in time of national crisis that could escalate to a major crisis. \nDuring the Carter administration, a talk began with the government of Panama handover the Panama Canal and led to the Panama Canal Treaty. On September 26, 1977, Brown gave a testimony to House Committee on International Relations regarding his opinion on Panama Canal Treaty. Brown's remarks was very essence and Brown also emphasized about the important need of United States use of Canal and instead of ownership. Brown also emphasized that the United States Military must had all the access to the Canal, both in wartime and in peace time and its security must be continually assured. Brown sees that the capability to defend the Panama Canal in-order not to fall into the wrong hand was depend on the cooperation between the United States and Panama. \nGeneral Brown remained a year within Carter administration, from January 20th 1977 to June 20th 1978. During his last tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Brown continued to advise and emphasize to Carter Administration about the importance of the United States Military arsenal modernization and buildup of its deterrence against the potential threat, even-though Carter administration stressed more on Pentagon Budget reduction. Many of his colleague on the Department of Defense and the Joint Staff praised Brown leadership during his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld who praised Brown as one of the most brilliant and smartest man he ever worked with. \nRetirement.\nBrown was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"prostate%20cancer\"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; in early 1978. Although Brown was still able to carry out his duties as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his cancer caused his health to deteriorate, forcing him to take early retirement on 21 June 1978, twelve days before he was due to retire as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown was replaced by Air Force Chief of Staff General David C. Jones, who assumed the position on June 21, 1978. \nAlthough he was ill, Brown remained involved in discussions on a number of military matters and appeared on a Public Policy Forum TV program in 1978 to discuss the roles of the Joint Chiefs of Staff along with a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown died at the &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Grow%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Malcolm Grow Air Force Hospital&lt;/a&gt; at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on 5 December 1978, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Section 21.\nDates of rank.\nSource: "
