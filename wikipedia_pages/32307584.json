Later, under the management of his son Ilvo, the company introduced steel for interurban and touristic coaches, using &lt;a href=\"Fiat\"&gt;Fiat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Officine%20Meccaniche\"&gt;OM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancia\"&gt;Lancia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alfa%20Romeo\"&gt;Alfa&lt;/a&gt; chassis.\nIn the sixties they started assembling buses on Fiat truck-chassis and sold over a thousand units to the public transport companies in Italy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1976%20Friuli%20earthquake\"&gt;1976 Friuli earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, with its epicenter in Osoppo, ruined most of the plants in &lt;a href=\"Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia\"&gt;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&lt;/a&gt;, including De Simon's. Ilvo with his sons Giovanni and Alvio managed to rebuild the plant in only two years' time. The new site covered 70,000 square meters and included two office buildings and a test track.\nIn 1978, De Simon together with &lt;a href=\"Breda%20Costruzioni%20Ferroviarie\"&gt;Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie&lt;/a&gt; formed a new consortium called &lt;a href=\"Inbus\"&gt;Inbus&lt;/a&gt;, which in the 1980s achieved a 30% share of the national bus market. During this time, De Simon built a new construction plant in &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, called IMEA, that would be the main supplier of the island for urban and interurban buses. During its ten years of existence the Inbus consortium produced about 6,000 buses, of which 30% were assembled by De Simon.\nAfter the disbanding of the consortium in 1990, De Simon continued producing buses in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Iveco\"&gt;Iveco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, introducing for the first time in Italy the bodies built from stainless steel.\nStarting in 1993, De Simon focussed mainly on intercity buses built entirely from stainless steel, using chassis from European manufacturers &lt;a href=\"Scania%20AB\"&gt;Scania&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;. In the urban sector, De Simon held a franchise to sell in Italy the buses of the Belgian manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Van%20Hool\"&gt;Van Hool&lt;/a&gt;, between 8 and 18 meters in length, and available even with a &lt;a href=\"Compressed%20natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;-powered engine.\nBetween 1996 and 2002, the Romanian bus manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Rocar\"&gt;Rocar&lt;/a&gt; and De Simon had a cooperation for the assembly of 400 urban buses.\nIn the following five years the company developed a new range of buses called Millemiglia, designed for interurban lines, between 10.8 and 14 meters in length. Such fleets were for use in the towns of &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;. Their line-up also included a touristic open-top bus called Millemiglia Zefiro.\nIn 2006, De Simon Group established themselves as a &lt;a href=\"joint-stock%20company\"&gt;joint-stock company&lt;/a&gt; mainly managing the supply of spare parts for bus bodies and repairs, maintenance, and conversion of bus bodies.\nIn 2007, as an independent company, De Simon achieved a sales volume of 150 buses and a turnover of more than 20 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s.\nProducts.\nThe current line-up of buses:"
