    "text": "Jan Hendrik Scholten (born Johannes Heinrich Scholten, 17 August 1811, &lt;a href=\"Vleuten\"&gt;Vleuten&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 10 April 1885, &lt;a href=\"Leiden\"&gt;Leiden&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; theologian, was born at &lt;a href=\"Vleuten\"&gt;Vleuten&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Utrecht%20%28city%29\"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAfter studying at &lt;a href=\"Utrecht%20University\"&gt;Utrecht University&lt;/a&gt;, he was appointed professor of theology in 1840 at &lt;a href=\"Franeker\"&gt;Franeker&lt;/a&gt;. From Franeker in 1843 he went to Leiden as professor \"extraordinarius\", and in 1845 was promoted to the rank of \"ordinarius\". Through Scholten, &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Kuenen\"&gt;Abraham Kuenen&lt;/a&gt; became interested in theology; Scholten was not then the radical theologian he became later. The two scholars in course of time created a movement resembling that of the &lt;a href=\"university%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen\"&gt;T\u00fcbingen&lt;/a&gt; School in Germany. From his theology there \"began to rise a different type of spirit, the spirit of absolute &lt;a href=\"antisupernaturalism\"&gt;antisupernaturalism&lt;/a&gt; of the German idealistic kind.\"\nPursuing first the study of dogmatic theology and the philosophy of religion, Scholten published a work on the \"Principles of the Theology of the Reformed Church\" (2 vols, 1848\u20131850, 4th ed. 1861\u20131862). He then gave special attention to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote \"A Critical Study of the Gospel of John\" (1864, in German 1867).\nScholten's other works include:\nAn account of his theological development is given in \"Afscheidsrede bij het Neerleggen van het Hoogleeraarsambt\" (1881), and in the biography written by A Kuenen, \"Levensbericht van J. Henricus Scholten\" (1885).\nHe became member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1856."
