    "text": "This is a list of the highest &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. This list only includes summits above with a &lt;a href=\"topographic%20prominence\"&gt;topographic prominence&lt;/a&gt; of at least 30 metres. Note that this list includes many secondary summits that are typically not considered mountains (in the strict sense of the term) but that are mainly of climbing interest. For a list of major summits only, without elevation cut-off, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mountains%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;List of mountains of Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Climbing%20and%20Mountaineering%20Federation\"&gt;International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation&lt;/a&gt; defines a summit in the &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the \"key col\"). There are over 250 such summits exceeding 3,600 m in Switzerland, all located in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Alps\"&gt;High Alps&lt;/a&gt;, in five &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;cantons&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Valais\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Grisons\"&gt;Graub\u00fcnden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Glarus\"&gt;Glarus&lt;/a&gt;. All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-&lt;a href=\"scale%20%28map%29\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; maps available."
