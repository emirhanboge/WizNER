It is named for the mathematician .\nAn &lt;a href=\"antichain\"&gt;antichain&lt;/a&gt; in a partially ordered set is a set of elements no two of which are comparable to each other, and a chain is a set of elements every two of which are comparable. A chain decomposition is a partition of the elements of the order into &lt;a href=\"disjoint%20set\"&gt;disjoint&lt;/a&gt; chains. Dilworth's theorem states that, in any finite partially ordered set, the largest antichain has the same size as the smallest chain decomposition. Here, the size of the antichain is its number of elements, and the size of the chain decomposition is its number of chains. The width of the partial order is defined as the common size of the antichain and chain decomposition.\nA version of the theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that, when there exists a decomposition into finitely many chains, or when there exists a finite upper bound on the size of an antichain, the sizes of the largest antichain and of the smallest chain decomposition are again equal.\nInductive proof.\nThe following proof by induction on the size of the partially ordered set formula_1 is based on that of .\nLet formula_1 be a finite partially ordered set. The theorem holds trivially if formula_1 is empty. So, assume that formula_1 has at least one element, and let formula_5 be a maximal element of formula_1.\nBy induction, we assume that for some integer formula_7 the partially ordered set formula_8 can be covered by formula_7 disjoint chains formula_10 and has at least one antichain formula_11 of size formula_7. Clearly, formula_13 for formula_14. For formula_14, let formula_16 be the maximal element in formula_17 that belongs to an antichain of size formula_7 in formula_19, and set formula_20. \nWe claim that formula_21 is an antichain. \nLet formula_22 be an antichain of size formula_7 that contains formula_16. Fix arbitrary distinct indices formula_25 and formula_26. Then formula_27. Let formula_28. Then formula_29, by the definition of formula_30. This implies that formula_31, since formula_32. By interchanging the roles of formula_25 and formula_26 in this argument we also have formula_35. This verifies that formula_21 is an antichain.\nWe now return to formula_1. Suppose first that formula_38 for some formula_39. Let formula_40 be the chain formula_41. Then by the choice of formula_16, formula_43 does not have an antichain of size formula_7. Induction then implies that formula_43 can be covered by formula_46 disjoint chains since formula_47 is an antichain of size formula_48 in formula_49. \nThus, formula_1 can be covered by formula_7 disjoint chains, as required. Next, if formula_52 for each formula_39, then formula_54 is an antichain of size formula_55 in formula_1 (since formula_5 is maximal in formula_1). Now formula_1 can be covered by the formula_55 chains formula_61, completing the proof.\nProof via K\u0151nig's theorem.\nLike a number of other results in combinatorics, Dilworth's theorem is equivalent to &lt;a href=\"K%C5%91nig%27s%20theorem%20%28graph%20theory%29\"&gt;K\u0151nig's theorem&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"bipartite%20graph\"&gt;bipartite graph&lt;/a&gt; matching and several other related theorems including &lt;a href=\"Hall%27s%20marriage%20theorem\"&gt;Hall's marriage theorem&lt;/a&gt; .\nTo prove Dilworth's theorem for a partial order \"S\" with \"n\" elements, using K\u0151nig's theorem, define a bipartite graph \"G\" = (\"U\",\"V\",\"E\") where \"U\" = \"V\" = \"S\" and where (\"u\",\"v\") is an edge in \"G\" when \"u\" &lt; \"v\" in \"S\". By K\u0151nig's theorem, there exists a matching \"M\" in \"G\", and a set of vertices \"C\" in \"G\", such that each edge in the graph contains at least one vertex in \"C\" and such that \"M\" and \"C\" have the same cardinality \"m\". Let \"A\" be the set of elements of \"S\" that do not correspond to any vertex in \"C\"; then \"A\" has at least \"n\" - \"m\" elements (possibly more if \"C\" contains vertices corresponding to the same element on both sides of the bipartition) and no two elements of \"A\" are comparable to each other. Let \"P\" be a family of chains formed by including \"x\" and \"y\" in the same chain whenever there is an edge (\"x\",\"y\") in \"M\"; then \"P\" has \"n\" - \"m\" chains. Therefore, we have constructed an antichain and a partition into chains with the same cardinality.\nTo prove K\u0151nig's theorem from Dilworth's theorem, for a bipartite graph \"G\" = (\"U\",\"V\",\"E\"), form a partial order on the vertices of \"G\" in which \"u\" &lt; \"v\" exactly when \"u\" is in \"U\", \"v\" is in \"V\", and there exists an edge in \"E\" from \"u\" to \"v\". By Dilworth's theorem, there exists an antichain \"A\" and a partition into chains \"P\" both of which have the same size. But the only nontrivial chains in the partial order are pairs of elements corresponding to the edges in the graph, so the nontrivial chains in \"P\" form a matching in the graph. The complement of \"A\" forms a vertex cover in \"G\" with the same cardinality as this matching.\nThis connection to bipartite matching allows the width of any partial order to be computed in &lt;a href=\"polynomial%20time\"&gt;polynomial time&lt;/a&gt;. More precisely, \"n\"-element partial orders of width \"k\" can be recognized in time \"O\"(\"kn\"2) .\nExtension to infinite partially ordered sets.\nDilworth's theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that a partially ordered set has finite width \"w\" if and only if it may be partitioned into \"w\" chains. For, suppose that an infinite partial order \"P\" has width \"w\", meaning that there are at most a finite number \"w\" of elements in any antichain. For any subset \"S\" of \"P\", a decomposition into \"w\" chains (if it exists) may be described as a &lt;a href=\"graph%20coloring\"&gt;coloring&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"comparability%20graph\"&gt;incomparability graph&lt;/a&gt; of \"S\" (a graph that has the elements of \"S\" as vertices, with an edge between every two incomparable elements) using \"w\" colors; every color class in a proper coloring of the incomparability graph must be a chain. By the assumption that \"P\" has width \"w\", and by the finite version of Dilworth's theorem, every finite subset \"S\" of \"P\" has a \"w\"-colorable incomparability graph. Therefore, by the &lt;a href=\"De%20Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s%20theorem%20%28graph%20theory%29\"&gt;De Bruijn\u2013Erd\u0151s theorem&lt;/a&gt;, \"P\" itself also has a \"w\"-colorable incomparability graph, and thus has the desired partition into chains .\nHowever, the theorem does not extend so simply to partially ordered sets in which the width, and not just the cardinality of the set, is infinite. In this case the size of the largest antichain and the minimum number of chains needed to cover the partial order may be very different from each other. In particular, for every infinite cardinal number \u03ba there is an infinite partially ordered set of width &lt;a href=\"Aleph-naught\"&gt;\u21350&lt;/a&gt; whose partition into the fewest chains has \u03ba chains .\n discusses analogues of Dilworth's theorem in the infinite setting.\nDual of Dilworth's theorem (Mirsky's theorem).\nA dual of Dilworth's theorem states that the size of the largest chain in a partial order (if finite) equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned . The proof of this is much simpler than the proof of Dilworth's theorem itself: for any element \"x\", consider the chains that have \"x\" as their largest element, and let \"N\"(\"x\") denote the size of the largest of these \"x\"-maximal chains. Then each set \"N\"\u22121(\"i\"), consisting of elements that have equal values of \"N\", is an antichain, and these antichains partition the partial order into a number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain.\nPerfection of comparability graphs.\nA &lt;a href=\"comparability%20graph\"&gt;comparability graph&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"undirected%20graph\"&gt;undirected graph&lt;/a&gt; formed from a partial order by creating a vertex per element of the order, and an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Thus, a &lt;a href=\"Clique%20%28graph%20theory%29\"&gt;clique&lt;/a&gt; in a comparability graph corresponds to a chain, and an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20set%20%28graph%20theory%29\"&gt;independent set&lt;/a&gt; in a comparability graph corresponds to an antichain. Any &lt;a href=\"induced%20subgraph\"&gt;induced subgraph&lt;/a&gt; of a comparability graph is itself a comparability graph, formed from the restriction of the partial order to a subset of its elements.\nAn undirected graph is &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20graph\"&gt;perfect&lt;/a&gt; if, in every induced subgraph, the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20number\"&gt;chromatic number&lt;/a&gt; equals the size of the largest clique. Every comparability graph is perfect: this is essentially just Mirsky's theorem, restated in graph-theoretic terms . By the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20graph%20theorem\"&gt;perfect graph theorem&lt;/a&gt; of , the &lt;a href=\"Complement%20graph\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of any perfect graph is also perfect. Therefore, the complement of any comparability graph is perfect; this is essentially just Dilworth's theorem itself, restated in graph-theoretic terms . Thus, the complementation property of perfect graphs can provide an alternative proof of Dilworth's theorem.\nWidth of special partial orders.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Boolean%20lattice\"&gt;Boolean lattice&lt;/a&gt; \"B\"\"n\" is the &lt;a href=\"power%20set\"&gt;power set&lt;/a&gt; of an \"n\"-element set \"X\"\u2014essentially {1, 2, \u2026, \"n\"}\u2014ordered by &lt;a href=\"inclusion%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;inclusion&lt;/a&gt; or, notationally, (2[\"n\"], \u2286). &lt;a href=\"Sperner%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Sperner's theorem&lt;/a&gt; states that a maximum antichain of \"B\"\"n\" has size at most\nIn other words, a largest family of incomparable subsets of \"X\" is obtained by selecting the subsets of \"X\" that have median size. The &lt;a href=\"Lubell%E2%80%93Yamamoto%E2%80%93Meshalkin%20inequality\"&gt;Lubell\u2013Yamamoto\u2013Meshalkin inequality&lt;/a&gt; also concerns antichains in a power set and can be used to prove Sperner's theorem.\nIf we order the integers in the interval [1,\u00a02\"n\"] by &lt;a href=\"divisibility\"&gt;divisibility&lt;/a&gt;, the subinterval [\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01,\u00a02\"n\"] forms an antichain with cardinality \"n\". A partition of this partial order into \"n\" chains is easy to achieve: for each odd integer \"m\" in [1,2\"n\"], form a chain of the numbers of the form \"m\"2\"i\". Therefore, by Dilworth's theorem, the width of this partial order is \"n\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres%20theorem\"&gt;Erd\u0151s\u2013Szekeres theorem&lt;/a&gt; on monotone subsequences can be interpreted as an application of Dilworth's theorem to partial orders of &lt;a href=\"order%20dimension\"&gt;order dimension&lt;/a&gt; two .\nThe \"convex dimension\" of an &lt;a href=\"antimatroid\"&gt;antimatroid&lt;/a&gt; is defined as the minimum number of chains needed to define the antimatroid, and Dilworth's theorem can be used to show that it equals the width of an associated partial order; this connection leads to a polynomial time algorithm for convex dimension ."
