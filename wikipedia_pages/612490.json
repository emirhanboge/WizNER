The mountains west of it are known as &lt;a href=\"Daxiangling\"&gt;Daxiangling&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large surrounding area of countryside is geologically known as the Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, a &lt;a href=\"large%20igneous%20province\"&gt;large igneous province&lt;/a&gt; generated by the &lt;a href=\"Emeishan%20Traps\"&gt;Emeishan Traps&lt;/a&gt; volcanic eruptions during the &lt;a href=\"Permian\"&gt;Permian Period&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministratively, Mount Emei is located near the &lt;a href=\"county-level%20city\"&gt;county-level city&lt;/a&gt; of the same name (&lt;a href=\"Emeishan%20City\"&gt;Emeishan City&lt;/a&gt;), which is in turn part of the &lt;a href=\"prefecture-level%20city\"&gt;prefecture-level city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Leshan\"&gt;Leshan&lt;/a&gt;. It was made a &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; in 1996.\nAs a sacred mountain.\nMount Emei is one of the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Mountains%20of%20China%23The%20Four%20Sacred%20Mountains%20of%20Buddhism\"&gt;Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China&lt;/a&gt;, and is traditionally regarded as the &lt;a href=\"bodhima%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Da\"&gt;bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da&lt;/a&gt;, or place of enlightenment, of the &lt;a href=\"bodhisattva\"&gt;bodhisattva&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt;.

The monasteries demonstrate a flexible architectural style that adapts to the landscape. Some, such as the halls of Baoguosi, are built on terraces of varying levels, while others, including the structures of Leiyinsi, are on raised stilts. Here the fixed plans of Buddhist monasteries of earlier periods were modified or ignored in order to make full use of the natural scenery. The buildings of Qingyinge are laid out in an irregular plot on the narrow piece of land between the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20River\"&gt;Black Dragon River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20River\"&gt;White Dragon River&lt;/a&gt;.
