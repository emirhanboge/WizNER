Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Donaghy\"&gt;Jack Donaghy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alec%20Baldwin\"&gt;Alec Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;) tries to help &lt;a href=\"Tracy%20Jordan\"&gt;Tracy Jordan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tracy%20Morgan\"&gt;Tracy Morgan&lt;/a&gt;) and his wife, Angie (Shepherd), arrange a post-nuptial agreement and &lt;a href=\"Jenna%20Maroney\"&gt;Jenna Maroney&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jane%20Krakowski\"&gt;Jane Krakowski&lt;/a&gt;) auditions for a &lt;a href=\"Janis%20Joplin\"&gt;Janis Joplin&lt;/a&gt; biographical film. At the same time, Jack finds a new love in the form of Elisa (Hayek), his mother's nurse.\n\"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to the &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20Media%20Research\"&gt;Nielsen Media Research&lt;/a&gt;, the episode was watched by 5.4\u00a0million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.3 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18\u201349 demographic.\nPlot.\n&lt;a href=\"Liz%20Lemon\"&gt;Liz Lemon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tina%20Fey\"&gt;Tina Fey&lt;/a&gt;) desires to have a baby, but her adoption process is taking a long time. She begins to act \"baby-crazy\" when she is around little children. While outside of 30 Rock, Liz pats a boy in front of her on the head, only to discover that it is not a child but a dwarf man, Stewart LaGrange (&lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dinklage\"&gt;Peter Dinklage&lt;/a&gt;). To cover up, Liz lies to Stewart, telling him that the reason she pat his head was to get his attention, which he accepts and the two go on a date. During their date, Liz tries to pick Stewart up to stop him from touching fire. Stewart asks Liz if she first thought he was a child when they first met, and she admits this is true, displeasing him. The next day, she calls him to apologize and asks that he give her a second chance and meet her at the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Bridge\"&gt;Brooklyn Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. At the bridge, however, Liz mistakenly thinks a boy is Stewart, which prompts him to realize this will never work between them.\nIn another storyline, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Donaghy\"&gt;Jack Donaghy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alec%20Baldwin\"&gt;Alec Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;) hires a new nurse, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%2030%20Rock%20characters%23Elisa%20Pedrera\"&gt;Elisa Pedrera&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Salma%20Hayek\"&gt;Salma Hayek&lt;/a&gt;), to take care of his mother, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%2030%20Rock%20characters%23Colleen%20Donaghy\"&gt;Colleen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Elaine%20Stritch\"&gt;Elaine Stritch&lt;/a&gt;). Meanwhile, Jack helps &lt;a href=\"Tracy%20Jordan\"&gt;Tracy Jordan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tracy%20Morgan\"&gt;Tracy Morgan&lt;/a&gt;) manage his money because his spending has gotten out of control. Jack recommends a \"post-nup\" agreement for Tracy and his wife, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%2030%20Rock%20characters%23Angie%20Jordan\"&gt;Angie&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sherri%20Shepherd\"&gt;Sherri Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;), as Tracy fears that Angie might leave him if she ever were to have enough money to live on. Angie agrees to sign the agreement but promises Tracy that she will never leave his side, which moves Tracy and he stops her from signing the agreement. Later, Jack feels a lump in one of his testicles, and believing he has &lt;a href=\"testicular%20cancer\"&gt;testicular cancer&lt;/a&gt;, he begins to look at life differently. He admits to Liz that he has fallen in love with Elisa after they spent some time together. When he gets his tests results, which come back negative, he has second thoughts about Elisa. In the end, however, Jack comes home to Elisa, and the two share a kiss.\nFinally, &lt;a href=\"Jenna%20Maroney\"&gt;Jenna Maroney&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jane%20Krakowski\"&gt;Jane Krakowski&lt;/a&gt;) learns that Sheinhardt Universal\u2014the fictional owner of &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt;\u2014is producing a biographical film on singer &lt;a href=\"Janis%20Joplin\"&gt;Janis Joplin&lt;/a&gt;, and she decides to audition for it.

Much to her dismay, Jenna learns that actress &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Roberts\"&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and director &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Scorsese\"&gt;Martin Scorsese&lt;/a&gt; are also making a Janis Joplin movie and that Sheinhardt Universal has yet to secure the song and image rights of Joplin.

O'Dell played herself in the March 12, 2009, episode \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Funcooker\"&gt;The Funcooker&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Fey\"&gt;Tina Fey&lt;/a&gt; and Dinklage shot one of their first scenes from the episode on October 6, 2008.\nCultural references.\nSigns of Tracy's money spending problems included his purchase of three hours of prime-time as a salute to &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Hill\"&gt;Benny Hill&lt;/a&gt;. When Elisa informs Jack that he has a lump on one of his testicles, Jack responds, \"Thank you for telling me what I already know. You should work for the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Huffington%20Post\"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;\"\", the latter being a &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; news and aggregated blog website that Alec Baldwin has been a contributor to since 2005. Elisa tells Jack that \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" is \"what we call a &lt;a href=\"McRib\"&gt;McRib&lt;/a&gt; sandwich\", a sandwich sold at &lt;a href=\"McDonald%27s\"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"NBC%20page\"&gt;NBC page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Parcell\"&gt;Kenneth Parcell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jack%20McBrayer\"&gt;Jack McBrayer&lt;/a&gt;) does the \"Top That\" rap from the fantasy-comedy film \"&lt;a href=\"Teen%20Witch\"&gt;Teen Witch&lt;/a&gt;\" (1989). Jenna sings the song \"&lt;a href=\"Piece%20of%20My%20Heart\"&gt;Piece of My Heart&lt;/a&gt;\", from Janis Joplin, though, the lyrics had been reworded by Jack so that Sheinhardt Universal avoid legal problems. In addition, Jenna sings the song and carries a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Daniel%27s\"&gt;Jack Daniel's&lt;/a&gt; in hand, a real life trait of the late singer.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" is frequently referenced in \"30 Rock\", beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20%2830%20Rock%29\"&gt;pilot episode&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting that he is a &lt;a href=\"Jedi\"&gt;Jedi&lt;/a&gt;. Liz admits to being a huge fan of \"Star Wars\", saying that she had watched it many times with &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Hornberger\"&gt;Pete Hornberger&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Scott%20Adsit\"&gt;Scott Adsit&lt;/a&gt;), and dressed up as the \"Star Wars\" character &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Leia\"&gt;Princess Leia&lt;/a&gt; during four recent Halloweens, and while trying to get out of jury duty in Chicago. \"Star Wars\" is also referenced when Tracy takes on the identity of the character &lt;a href=\"Chewbacca\"&gt;Chewbacca&lt;/a&gt;. In this episode, Liz tells Stewart that there are many languages and costumes in the conference room of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"it must be like working in the &lt;a href=\"Galactic%20Senate\"&gt;Galactic Senate&lt;/a&gt; in \"Star Wars\"\". Stewart responds, \"They are similar. We're also concerned about the growing influence of the &lt;a href=\"Sith\"&gt;Sith Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nReception.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20Media%20Research\"&gt;Nielsen Media Research&lt;/a&gt;, \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" was watched by 5.4\u00a0million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.3 rating/5 share in the 18\u201349 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \"&lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Special%20%2830%20Rock%29\"&gt;Christmas Special&lt;/a&gt;\", which was watched by 8.9\u00a0million American viewers. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews.\n&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; contributor Robert Canning praised \"30 Rock\" for putting it all together \"so seamlessly\" and \"so brilliantly balanced\" in \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing that it was a \"fantastic Tracy Jordan moment.\" He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back \"into the mix\". He also liked that this episode \"delivered some great work\" from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Star-Ledger\"&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;\" appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was \"the first really work-centric one in a while.\" He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of &lt;a href=\"AOL\"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"TV%20Squad\"&gt;TV Squad&lt;/a&gt; said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd \"fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them.\" Gallagher noted that Dinklage was \"pretty awesome\" as Tina Fey's love interest, \"and I would have loved to see more of them together. I really think they could have done more with this storyline.\" According to Gallagher, the only part of \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" that she was not \"crazy about\" was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.\n\"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Matt Mitovich observed that \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" was the \"best episode of the season\" as it \"kept all of the comedy rooted in the actual storylines\". He wrote that the Tracy story was \"packed [with] plenty of amusement\", and that the character's spending problem was \"funny for the sight gags alone\". Mitovich commented that Hayek's character was \"one of Jack's best matches yet\". Jeremy Median of \"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\" opined that \"Se\u00f1or Macho Solo\" featured one of the \"funniest sight gags in \"30 Rock\" history\", referring to Tracy wearing a coat made out of money, shoes made of gold, and \"a Mad Hatter-like hat made out of money, as only Tracy could pull off.\" He also wrote that it was nice to be reminded of Liz's \"baby-cravings, a story that's been bubbling on the surface for a while now but reemerged here.\" Nathan Rabin for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that this episode \"juggled its various lovestruck plots with aplomb\", and gave this episode an A\u2212. Rabin liked all the plots, but most enjoyed Jenna's story of her trying to play Janis Joplin."
