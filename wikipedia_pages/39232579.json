    "text": "The 1895 World Championship was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match that took place at &lt;a href=\"Tynecastle%20Park\"&gt;Tynecastle Park&lt;/a&gt; on 27 April 1895 between the winner of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;English Football League First Division&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Scottish%20football%20champions\"&gt;Scottish League Division One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;/a&gt;. The match was won by Sunderland \n5\u20133.\nThe wealthy miner Samuel Tyzack, who alongside and shipbuilder Robert Turnbull funded the Sunderland side known as the \"team of all talents,\" often pretended to be a priest while scouting for players in Scotland, as Sunderland's recruitment policy in Scotland enraged many Scottish fans. In fact, the Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship consisted entirely of Scottish players - Scottish players who moved to England to play professionally in those days were nicknamed the &lt;a href=\"Scotch%20Professors\"&gt;Scotch Professors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game was not the first &lt;a href=\"Football%20World%20Championship\"&gt;\"World Championship\" game&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; sides; and it was the second such club competition won by an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; team, with previous winners being &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renton%20F.C.\"&gt;Renton&lt;/a&gt; (both &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners, as the leagues had not been yet created at the time). The Scottish and English leagues were pre-eminent in the world at that time. However, it was the first ever game played between the respective champions of two different leagues.\nThis was the only international competition Sunderland won; they subsequently participated in the &lt;a href=\"British%20League%20Cup\"&gt;British League Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1902 and the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Exhibition%20Trophy\"&gt;Empire Exhibition Trophy&lt;/a&gt; in 1938 but exited early in those competitions."
