    "text": "Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg (, ) is an &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;administrative county&lt;/a&gt; (Hungarian: \"megye\") in north-eastern &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, bordering &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%A1ice%20Region\"&gt;Ko\u0161ice Region&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Zakarpattia%20Oblast\"&gt;Zakarpattia Oblast&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bihor%20County\"&gt;Bihor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satu%20Mare%20County\"&gt;Satu Mare&lt;/a&gt; counties). It shares borders with the Hungarian counties &lt;a href=\"Hajd%C3%BA-Bihar%20County\"&gt;Hajd\u00fa-Bihar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n%20County\"&gt;Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg county is &lt;a href=\"Ny%C3%ADregyh%C3%A1za\"&gt;Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za&lt;/a&gt;.\nSzabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County was organised after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; from the previous counties &lt;a href=\"Szatm%C3%A1r\"&gt;Szatm\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;-Ugocsa-Bereg and &lt;a href=\"Szabolcs%20%28county%29\"&gt;Szabolcs&lt;/a&gt;. Before 1991, it was called Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r County.\nGeography.\nSzabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg is located in the north-eastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. It borders &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Zakarpattia%20Oblast\"&gt;Zakarpattia Oblast&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%A1ice%20Region\"&gt;Ko\u0161ice Region&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bihor%20County\"&gt;Bihor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satu%20Mare%20County\"&gt;Satu Mare&lt;/a&gt; counties), and has good connections both by road and rail. Within Hungary, the county is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Borsod-Aba%C3%BAj-Zempl%C3%A9n%20County\"&gt;Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tisza\"&gt;Tisza River&lt;/a&gt; to the north-west and &lt;a href=\"Hajd%C3%BA-Bihar%20County\"&gt;Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County&lt;/a&gt; to the south-west.\nThe early Hungarians transformed this region significantly by clearing large areas of forest to make way for &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s and farmland. Approximately 5 to 6 square kilometres of forest were cleared for the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Szabolcs%20%28village%29\"&gt;Szabolcs&lt;/a&gt; earthwork in the ninth and tenth centuries, and its ruins are still present. The area was the gateway for the Mongol invasion of Hungary in the 1240s, and suffered considerable destruction and population decrease during the raids. With the subsequent development of the country, the region became even more marginalized in the 15th century. Ongoing civil war, &lt;a href=\"rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, and war exacted a heavy price and further hindered the region's development.\nThe county's borders have been altered frequently over the years, its current territory being established in 1950 with the amalgamation of the counties of Szabolcs-Ung and Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg-Ugocsa.\nThere are many forests, &lt;a href=\"Field%20%28agriculture%29\"&gt;fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"moorland\"&gt;moorland&lt;/a&gt; forests in the county. The &lt;a href=\"bog\"&gt;bog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt; moors at &lt;a href=\"Csaroda\"&gt;Csaroda&lt;/a&gt;, the Ny\u00edres lake, and the B\u00e1btava lake are especially valuable, as they contain many rare species of fauna and flora.\nSzabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg is Hungary's sixth biggest county with a total land area of . From a geographical aspect, it is possible to divide the county into two main regions: The &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Tisza%20Valley\"&gt;Upper Tisza Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the Ny\u00edrs\u00e9g. &lt;a href=\"Tisza\"&gt;Tisza&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important rivers of the county, entering Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg\u00a0\u2014 and Hungary\u00a0\u2014 at &lt;a href=\"Tiszabecs\"&gt;Tiszabecs&lt;/a&gt;, and leaving at &lt;a href=\"Tiszadob\"&gt;Tiszadob&lt;/a&gt;. Its segment in Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg county is 235 kilometres long, out of which belongs to the Upper Tisza Valley, reaching the area of &lt;a href=\"Tokaj\"&gt;Tokaj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rakamaz\"&gt;Rakamaz&lt;/a&gt;. The larger area named the Ny\u00edrs\u00e9g is derived from the word ny\u00edr meaning &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt;, as the region is dominated by birch woodlands. The northern part of Ny\u00edrs\u00e9g is covered with sandy forest soils, the southern areas have loose wind-blown sand. Alluvial and meadow soils are found in the Upper Tisza region.\nThe county has a &lt;a href=\"continental%20climate\"&gt;continental climate&lt;/a&gt;; it is cooler than the Great Plain because it is further north. Summers are cooler than in other parts of the Plains. Annual &lt;a href=\"Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;precipitation&lt;/a&gt; is 550\u2013600 millimetres. The higher than average number of days of sunshine make ideal conditions for the growing of tomatoes, sunflower, tobacco, apples, and other fruits such as plums\u2014for which the county is famous, being eaten fresh, dried into prunes (some made into &lt;a href=\"lekvar\"&gt;lekvar&lt;/a&gt;) and fermented into well-known brandies.\nThe county has 229 settlements, of which 20 are towns. The county capital and largest city is &lt;a href=\"Ny%C3%ADregyh%C3%A1za\"&gt;Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za&lt;/a&gt; with a population of 116,900 in 2003. The other cities have relatively small populations, only those of &lt;a href=\"Kisv%C3%A1rda\"&gt;Kisv\u00e1rda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1t%C3%A9szalka\"&gt;M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka&lt;/a&gt; having around 18,000 inhabitants. The eastern part of the county is lightly populated and is dotted with small villages which often have very poor economic conditions.\nThe Tisza River.\nThe Upper Tisza region has many streams and rivers, but the Ny\u00edrs\u00e9g region has little surface water. The most important of Tisza's tributaries is the river &lt;a href=\"Some%C8%99\"&gt;Szamos&lt;/a&gt;, which is also characterised by great variations in water volume. There are irrigation systems, a water &lt;a href=\"barrage%20%28dam%29\"&gt;barrage&lt;/a&gt;, and a hydroelectric power station on the Tisza at &lt;a href=\"Tiszal%C3%B6k\"&gt;Tiszal\u00f6k&lt;/a&gt;.\nLakes of various sizes have evolved in sandy areas such as the basin of the S\u00f3st\u00f3 (Salty lake) of &lt;a href=\"Ny%C3%ADregyh%C3%A1za\"&gt;Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"alkaline\"&gt;alkaline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20carbonate\"&gt;hydrogen-carbonate&lt;/a&gt;d waters have medicinal qualities. Many water &lt;a href=\"reservoirs\"&gt;reservoirs&lt;/a&gt; have been built according to local demand. Thermal waters of 55\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C can be brought to the surface from wells as shallow as 1,000 metres. The most important thermal water reserves are in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, Kisv\u00e1rda, M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka, and Tiszavasv\u00e1ri. The county's &lt;a href=\"geothermal%20energy\"&gt;geothermal energy&lt;/a&gt; still awaits exploitation.\nThe county has relatively few mineral reserves. Almost all of the large energy source transport systems cross the county.\nDemographics.\nIn 2015, it had a population of 562,357 and the population density was 92/km\u00b2.\nEthnicity.\nBesides the Hungarian majority, the main minority populations in the county are &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people%20in%20Hungary\"&gt;Romani&lt;/a&gt; (about 44,000), &lt;a href=\"Germans%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; (about 2,000), and &lt;a href=\"Ukrainians%20in%20Hungary\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; (about 1,000).\nTotal population (2011 census): 559,272\nEthnic groups (2011 census):\nAbout 66,000 people in Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County did not declare their ethnicity during the 2011 census.\nReligion.\nReligious adherence in the county according to 2011 census:\nEconomy.\nThe county borders three countries, and it is the only Hungarian county bordering Ukraine. The railway border crossing towards &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; is well developed; its high capacity is able to meet the requirements of transit and bilateral trade. Following the reconstruction of the road border crossing, the county is also able to cope with increased road transportation.\nSeveral regions in the county have tourism potential, mostly unexploited. Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg has several agricultural products of excellent quality, with capacity for higher production. There is an abundance of low-cost, semiskilled labour.\nThe county's biggest problem is the &lt;a href=\"economic%20crisis\"&gt;economic crisis&lt;/a&gt;. There is a shortage of local capital and inward investment, which restrains the creation of new jobs, thus the unemployment rate remains the second highest in Hungary. Manufacturing lags the rest of the country, most notably lacking high quality, high value-added products. The marginal soil quality limits the scope of agricultural production to a few products which suffer from shrinking export markets to the east.\nIt is home to the &lt;a href=\"Szakoly%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Szakoly Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitics.\nThe Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County Council, elected at the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Hungarian%20local%20elections\"&gt;2019 local government elections&lt;/a&gt;, is made up of 25 counselors, with the following party composition:\nMunicipalities.\nSzabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County has 1 &lt;a href=\"Town%20with%20county%20rights\"&gt;urban county&lt;/a&gt;, 27 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20and%20towns%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt;, 15 large villages and 186 villages.\n municipalities are \"large\" villages.\nInternational relations.\nSzabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County has a &lt;a href=\"Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; relationship with:"
