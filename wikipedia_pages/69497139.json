    "text": "Galloisiana is a genus of &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Grylloblattidae\"&gt;Grylloblattidae&lt;/a&gt; found in East Asia. It contains 12 species.\nSpecies.\nThese species belong to the genus \"Galloisiana\":\nRange and habitat.\nIn Japan, \"Galloisiana\" species prefer rocky areas and cool, moist environments, where they are frequently found near streams (often under rocks) in well developed forests. Unlike the \"&lt;a href=\"Grylloblatta\"&gt;Grylloblatta&lt;/a&gt;\" species of North America, they are not known to forage in snowfields. They are most abundant in montane habitats in central &lt;a href=\"Honshu\"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt;. In central Honshu, \"Galloisiana\" specimens have been collected in the following mountains and mountain ranges.\nSpecimens have also been collected in &lt;a href=\"Shikoku\"&gt;Shikoku&lt;/a&gt;, which are genetically close to specimens from the &lt;a href=\"Suzuka%20Mountains\"&gt;Suzuka Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiet.\n\"Galloisiana\" species are generalist scavengers that feed on both plant and animal materials."
