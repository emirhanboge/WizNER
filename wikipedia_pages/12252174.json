    "text": "Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina refers to artistic objects created by the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"prehistory\"&gt;prehistory&lt;/a&gt; to present times.\nAncient heritage.\nPrehistory.\nBosnia and Herzegovina hosts the oldest monument of the Paleolithic age in southeastern Europe, &lt;a href=\"engraving\"&gt;engraving&lt;/a&gt;s in \"Badanj\" cave near &lt;a href=\"Stolac\"&gt;Stolac&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Herzegovina\"&gt;Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous engraving is the \"Horse attacked by arrows\", preserved in fragments dated around 14000 - 12000 B.C.\nDuring the time when &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copper\"&gt;Copper&lt;/a&gt; cultures were starting to appear, &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Panonian\"&gt;Panonian&lt;/a&gt; cultures began to mix. Herzegovina was highly influenced by the impresso ceramics from the Western Mediterranean, as seen in \"Green Cave\" near &lt;a href=\"Mostar\"&gt;Mostar&lt;/a&gt;, \"\u010cairi\" near &lt;a href=\"Stolac\"&gt;Stolac&lt;/a&gt;, \"Lisi\u010di\u0107i\" near &lt;a href=\"Konjic\"&gt;Konjic&lt;/a&gt; and \"Pe\u0107 Mlini\" near &lt;a href=\"Grude\"&gt;Grude&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the upper regions of the Bosna river and the Northeastern parts of Bosnia (\"Obre I\" near &lt;a href=\"Kakanj\"&gt;Kakanj&lt;/a&gt;) the local culture was influenced by Adriatic cultures in the South and the \"Star\u010devi\u0107 culture\" in the Northeast. Original expressions of that culture are ceramic pots on four legs, called &lt;a href=\"Rhyton\"&gt;Rhyton&lt;/a&gt;. They are also found in the \"Danilo culture\" on the Croatian coast.\nBecause of these influences, &lt;a href=\"Kakanj%20culture\"&gt;Kakanj culture&lt;/a&gt; is considered part of a wide circle of Neolithic tribes that followed a cult of life force (from northern &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Epirus\"&gt;Epirus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aegean%20Sea\"&gt;Aegean&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Butmir%20Culture\"&gt;Butmir Culture&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sarajevo\"&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt; is distinctive with fine glazed ceramics and miscellaneous geometrical decorations, often spirals.\nFrom the 7th century BC onwards, bronze was replaced by iron, and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. The bronze culture of the &lt;a href=\"Illyrians\"&gt;Illyrians&lt;/a&gt;, an ethnic group with a distinct art form, started to organize itself in what is today Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Different Illyrian tribes, under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Halstat\"&gt;Halstat&lt;/a&gt; cultures from the North, formed original regional centers. With the notable exception of &lt;a href=\"Pod%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Pod&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Bugojno\"&gt;Bugojno&lt;/a&gt; in the upper valley of the &lt;a href=\"Vrbas%20%28river%29\"&gt;Vrbas River&lt;/a&gt;, nothing is known of their settlements. In eastern Bosnia in the cemeteries of \"Beloti\u0107\" and \"Bela Crkva\", the rites of inhumation and &lt;a href=\"cremation\"&gt;cremation&lt;/a&gt; are attested, with skeletons in stone &lt;a href=\"cists\"&gt;cists&lt;/a&gt; and cremations in &lt;a href=\"urns\"&gt;urns&lt;/a&gt;. Metal implements appear here side by side with stone implements. Most of the remains belong to the Middle Bronze Age.\nA very important role played their death cult, evidence of which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies. Japodian tribes (found around &lt;a href=\"Biha%C4%87\"&gt;Biha\u0107&lt;/a&gt;) produced heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foils.\nIn the 4th century BC, the first &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celts&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the region, bringing with them the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. However, their influence on Bosnia and Herzegovina's art is negligible.\nAntiquity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Neretva%20Delta\"&gt;Neretva Delta&lt;/a&gt; in the South was heavily dominated by &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic\"&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/a&gt; influences of the &lt;a href=\"Daors\"&gt;Daors&lt;/a&gt;, an Illyrian tribe. Their capital was &lt;a href=\"Daorson\"&gt;Daorson&lt;/a&gt; in O\u0161ani\u0107i near &lt;a href=\"Stolac\"&gt;Stolac&lt;/a&gt;, the main center of Ancient culture in B&amp;H. &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt; subdued the Illyrians in the first century BC, with the &lt;a href=\"Illyria\"&gt;Illyria&lt;/a&gt;n provinces turning into provinces of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romans built several small &lt;a href=\"temples\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; decorated with &lt;a href=\"reliefs\"&gt;reliefs&lt;/a&gt;. The complex of \"step sanctuary in Gradac\" near &lt;a href=\"Posu%C5%A1je\"&gt;Posu\u0161je&lt;/a&gt; from year 184 AD had &lt;a href=\"marble\"&gt;marble&lt;/a&gt; temple dedicated to recently deceased emperor &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;. Late Roman art in B&amp;H is marked most dominantly expressed by the construction of villas, Christian &lt;a href=\"mausoleum\"&gt;mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"basilicas\"&gt;basilicas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oratories\"&gt;oratories&lt;/a&gt; like the Mausoleum in \u0160ipovo near &lt;a href=\"Jajce\"&gt;Jajce&lt;/a&gt; and Villa &lt;a href=\"Mogorjelo\"&gt;Mogorjelo&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Capljina\"&gt;\u010capljina&lt;/a&gt; as well as sculptures.\nMedieval art in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina the &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20art\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; influence came from &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; although it was never fully accepted and thus only adopted some elements from it.\nInfluences of &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20art\"&gt;Gothic art&lt;/a&gt; in the 14th century are represented by &lt;a href=\"preaching\"&gt;preaching&lt;/a&gt; orders and &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ly culture. In Bosnian culture, religion and nobility were the main perpetuating factors.\nFrom the earliest times of &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20Kingdom\"&gt;Bosnian Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; the nobility was buried in large necropolises near roads with graves marked by monumental tombstones (ste\u0107ak). A &lt;a href=\"Ste%C4%87ak\"&gt;Ste\u0107ak&lt;/a&gt; was sometimes engraved with &lt;a href=\"reliefs\"&gt;reliefs&lt;/a&gt; showing all sorts of motifs, from figurative to symbols, and sometimes writings in &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20Cyrillic\"&gt;Bosnian Cyrillic&lt;/a&gt;. They are strongly linked to the &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20Church\"&gt;Bosnian Church&lt;/a&gt; and most of the motifs are derived from its particular belief system, although some are also derived from Romanesque (crosses, arcades with semi-circular arches, son, half-moon etc.) and Gothic (arcades with sharp arches, knight riders, shields, swords, lilies etc.) art of the West.\nThe two most extraordinary examples of &lt;a href=\"illuminated%20manuscript\"&gt;illuminated manuscript&lt;/a&gt;s from medieval Bosnia are \"Hval\u2019s missionary\" in Zagreb, a lavishly decorated manuscript with many miniatures. \"Misal Hrvoja Vuk\u010di\u0107a Hrvatini\u0107a\" - a &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20book\"&gt;liturgical book&lt;/a&gt; of the Bosnian duke and ruler of Dalmatia - &lt;a href=\"Hrvoje%20Vuk%C4%8Di%C4%87%20Hrvatini%C4%87\"&gt;Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, today in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, is colourfully painted with many details of knightly culture. Both were painted in &lt;a href=\"Split%20%28city%29\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt;, Croatia.\nOttoman art in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn the 16th century, all of Bosnia was under &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt;, extinguishing the Western influence of renaissance and later baroque art from the region. The only places where some Western art remained was in &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; monasteries in &lt;a href=\"Visoko%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Visoko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kre%C5%A1evo\"&gt;Kre\u0161evo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franciscan%20monastery%20in%20Fojnica\"&gt;Franciscan monastery in Fojnica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franciscan%20monastery%20in%20Kraljeva%20Sutjeska\"&gt;Franciscan monastery in Kraljeva Sutjeska&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nHowever, the Ottoman period opened a new era in B&amp;H art, that of &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Art\"&gt;Islamic Art&lt;/a&gt; which flourished until the 19th century. At that time three constant art traditions coexisted in B&amp;H: Catholic-Western, Orthodox-Byzantine and the dominating Ottoman-Islamic one.\nThe Ottomans were quickly developing urban cities upon their conquest of B&amp;H, enriched by &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20architecture\"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20architecture\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; influences. For example, in &lt;a href=\"Fo%C4%8Da\"&gt;Fo\u010da&lt;/a&gt; in the 16th century, the Ottomans built 17 &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;s, 29 public &lt;a href=\"fountain\"&gt;fountain&lt;/a&gt;s, 6 &lt;a href=\"public%20bathing\"&gt;public baths&lt;/a&gt; (\"hamam\") and 13 caravanserai motels (han). &lt;a href=\"Sarajevo\"&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a non-urban open city where the most important buildings are organized around one veining street, a \"\u010dar\u0161ija\" (Persian chahar-su meaning all four sides). In Sarajevo the largest is famous &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%A1%C4%8Dar%C5%A1ija\"&gt;Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija&lt;/a&gt; with shops of 50 different crafts from the 15th century.\nIslamic &lt;a href=\"manuscript\"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt;s, decorated in the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20people\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; style with &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calligraphy\"&gt;Islamic calligraphy&lt;/a&gt;, and many remain in Bosnian libraries to this day. In the 16th century, the &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; expelled from Spain came to Sarajevo, where they were allowed to settle. Beside their important influence on Bosnian culture, they brought with them a luxuriously decorated manuscript called &lt;a href=\"Sarajevo%20Haggadah\"&gt;Sarajevo Haggadah&lt;/a&gt; from the 14th century, which is now housed in the Sarajevo museum.\nThe bridge is an important part of Islamic art, not only because of the great skill required of an architect, but because of its symbolic meaning a mediator between Heaven and Earth. One of the most famous examples is the &lt;a href=\"Stari%20Most\"&gt;Old Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mostar\"&gt;Mostar&lt;/a&gt;, built by \"Hajredin\", a pupil of the famous architect &lt;a href=\"Mimar%20Sinan\"&gt;Mimar Sinan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Bosnian Islamic architecture, stone is reserved for religious, public buildings and fortifications, while private houses were built out of wood and \"\u0107erpi\u0107\" (native simple bonding material made of clay and straw). With often console constructions of the upper floors, these houses allowed for more open spaces and large windows. When the power of Ottomans started to descend in the middle of the 17th century, so did the influence of Islamic art in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nArt in the Austro-Hungarian period.\nAfter Bosnia became part of &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, the region's art scene witnessed an intensification of activity as cities modernized and changed in structure. Architecture was dominated by &lt;a href=\"Eclecticism\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pseudo\"&gt;pseudo&lt;/a&gt; styles like &lt;a href=\"classicism\"&gt;classicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"neo-renaissance\"&gt;neo-renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;neo-baroque&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"neo-Romanesque\"&gt;neo-Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"neo-gothic\"&gt;neo-gothic&lt;/a&gt;. A unique pseudo style is the\"\u201coriental eclectic\u201d\" style (also referred to \"&lt;a href=\"Pseudo-Moorish%20style\"&gt;Pseudo-Moorish style&lt;/a&gt;\"), based on &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20architecture%23Moorish%20architecture\"&gt;Moorish architecture&lt;/a&gt; found in Southern &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The style contrasted markedly with the urban ambient of Bosnian cities at the time, as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Sarajevo\"&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt; (National Library and City Hall), &lt;a href=\"Mostar%20Gymnasium\"&gt;Mostar Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Travnik\"&gt;Travnik&lt;/a&gt; (Retirement Home).\nThe first Bosnian artists were educated in large European academies in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnchen\"&gt;M\u00fcnchen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krakow\"&gt;Krakow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to scholarships of cultural societies like \u201c&lt;a href=\"Prosvjeta\"&gt;Prosvjeta&lt;/a&gt;\u201d and \u201c&lt;a href=\"HKD%20Napredak\"&gt;Napredak&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. Artists like &lt;a href=\"Atanasije%20Popovi%C4%87\"&gt;Atanasije Popovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lazar%20Dralj%C4%8Da\"&gt;Lazar Drlja\u010da&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabrijel%20Jurki%C4%87\"&gt;Gabrijel Jurki\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Branko%20Radulovi%C4%87\"&gt;Branko Radulovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petar%20%C5%A0ain\"&gt;Petar \u0160ain&lt;/a&gt; etc., are influenced by &lt;a href=\"academism\"&gt;academism&lt;/a&gt; with slight touches of &lt;a href=\"impressionism\"&gt;impressionism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"art%20nouveau\"&gt;art nouveau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pointillism\"&gt;pointillism&lt;/a&gt;. After the Great Exhibition of Bosnian Artists in 1917, the native born artists have prevailed. Modern styles that entered B&amp;H were &lt;a href=\"expressionism\"&gt;expressionism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9zanne\"&gt;C\u00e9zanne&lt;/a&gt;s-ism.\nArt in the Yugoslavian Kingdom.\nAfter the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the society of artists from &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20SHS\"&gt;SHS&lt;/a&gt; (state of Serbians, Croats and Slovenians) was created and held numerous exhibitions and artistic gatherings like \"the Bla\u017euj colony\" of &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Beci%C4%87\"&gt;Vladimir Beci\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Participants o were &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Petrovi%C4%87\"&gt;Roman Petrovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Bijeli%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan Bijeli\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, both with abstract proclivities, while &lt;a href=\"Karlo%20Miji%C4%87\"&gt;Karlo Miji\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was devoted to colouristic landscapes.\nHowever, art production in B&amp;H was severely restricted, leading many artists to never retur to B&amp;H from their studies in &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beograd\"&gt;Beograd&lt;/a&gt;, while many were leaving the country. The first renewal happened with the \"\u201cGroup of Four\u201d\" and \"\u201cengaged art\u201d\" of Roman Petrovi\u0107 and his circle, \"\u201cThe children of the Street\u201d.\" Miji\u0107 and \"\u0110oko Mazali\u0107\" founded an art association called \"\u201cKrug\u201d\" (The Circle) with strong focus on urban aesthetics of nature. &lt;a href=\"Vojo%20Dimitrijevi%C4%87\"&gt;Vojo Dimitrijevi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; painted \"\u201cSpain in \u201837\u201d\", a representative artwork of colouristic expression with traces of Picasso and Chagall.\nIn the 1930s, architects were influenced by ideas of &lt;a href=\"Functionalism%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;functionalism&lt;/a&gt;, humane architecture and &lt;a href=\"Bauhaus\"&gt;Bauhaus&lt;/a&gt;. Those buildings were uniting function, content and form, without unnecessary plastic decoration, and with a simple rhythm of windows and modern constructions.\nArt in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nRight after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Communist Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; was founded, which allowed artists to find a new expression through the themes of &lt;a href=\"Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and War. Prominent representatives of this are Ismet Mujezinovi\u0107 and Branko \u0160otra. Architecture was also under the direct influence of Socialistic architecture, but never reached the monumentality of the original works.\nIn the 1950s, art slowly transformed to a more abstract outlook, based on industrial and economic motives. The first to do so was sculptor \"Mirko Ostoja\" who replaced classical modeling with iron welding. Even the Communist State changed its feeling toward modern art by commissioning large abstract monuments dedicated to famous battles in The War (&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sutjeska\"&gt;Sutjeska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kozara\"&gt;Kozara&lt;/a&gt;, Makljen etc.). Young architects gathered around professor \"Juraj Neidhardt\", and were trying to connect modern architecture with B&amp;H tradition and surroundings. The result were buildings like The Mostar Mall,\"\u201cRazvitak\u201d\" ,in 1970 by \"A. Paljaga\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Jajce\"&gt;Jajce&lt;/a&gt; Mall\" in 1976 by \"R. Jadri\u0107, D\u017e. Kari\u0107 and N. Kurto\".\nIn the 1960s many architects were leaving traditional boundaries and made important buildings in the manner of functionalism: The telecommunication building in &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Abeba\"&gt;Addis Abeba&lt;/a&gt; by Ivan \u0160traus and Zdravko Kovacevi\u0107, or \"\u201c&lt;a href=\"Skenderija\"&gt;Skenderija&lt;/a&gt;\u201d Hall\" in Sarajevo by \u017divorad Jankovi\u0107 and Halid Muhasilovi\u0107 are exemplary.\nIn the 1970s, an art expression inspired by old Bosnian culture and tradition appeared in the &lt;a href=\"graphic\"&gt;graphic&lt;/a&gt; work of D\u017eevad Hozo and in the paintings of Mehmed Zaimovi\u0107, Seid Hasanefendi\u0107 and &lt;a href=\"Mersad%20Berber\"&gt;Mersad Berber&lt;/a&gt;. Quite opposite to that, the urban expression of \"Ismar Mujezinovi\u0107\" is more related to modern film montage and &lt;a href=\"photo\"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"optics\"&gt;optics&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Braco%20Dimitrijevi%C4%87\"&gt;Braco Dimitrijevi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Conceptual%20art\"&gt;Conceptual art&lt;/a&gt;ist who worked mainly outside B&amp;H.\nAn example of architecture in the 1980s is the \"&lt;a href=\"Holiday%20Inn\"&gt;Holiday Inn&lt;/a&gt; Hotel\" built in 1983 and the \"\u201cUnis\u201d Twin Towers\" built in &lt;a href=\"Sarajevo\"&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt; in 1986, designed by &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20%C5%A0traus\"&gt;Ivan \u0160traus&lt;/a&gt;.\nArt after the Bosnian War.\nCultural preservation is under way in Bosnia and Herzegovina which can be seen with the most recent reconstruction of Stari Most in Mostar and many other structures of cultural and historical significance which were damaged or destroyed in the war.\nCommercial construction in the years following the Bosnian War has seen a boom in Sarajevo. Sarajevo is one of the cities with the most construction in southeastern Europe. The Unis Twin Towers have been renovated completely. On the site of the former \"Oslobodjenje Towers\", \"the Avaz towers\" have now been constructed. In the \"Hrasno\" residential area, the Bosnian Company Bosmal has constructed the &lt;a href=\"Bosmal%20City%20Center\"&gt;Bosmal City Center&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the tallest set of twin towers in the Balkans at 120 meters each.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Avaz%20Twist%20Tower\"&gt;Avaz Twist Tower&lt;/a&gt; located in Marijin Dvor, Sarajevo, is the tallest tower in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the new headquarters for Avaz, the most popular Bosnia and Herzegovina newspaper company."
