    "text": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) is the body responsible for match officials in English professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormerly known as the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOB), it was formed when English &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referees&lt;/a&gt; became professional in 2001, to provide officials for all games played in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt; (EFL) and &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (FA) competitions. The organisation is funded by the Premier League, EFL, and the FA.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Select%20Group%20Referees\"&gt;Select Group Referees&lt;/a&gt; primarily officiate in the Premier League, &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;EFL Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and will also occasionally referee in the EFL.\nEvaluation.\nThe Select Group Referees meet twice per month for training sessions and analysis of match videos and data.\nThe PGMOL have their own sports scientists, sports psychologists, physiotherapists, sprint coaches, podiatrists and vision scientists which mirror football clubs to help improve referee performance.\nEvery PGMOL referee is evaluated by a former senior referee to measure their technical performance, along with fellow players and managers (match delegates) who assess accuracy and consistency of their decision making and management of their game.\nSponsorship.\nThe PGMOL changed its sponsorship for the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2010\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Air%20Asia\"&gt;Air Asia&lt;/a&gt; to its parent group, &lt;a href=\"Tune%20Group\"&gt;Tune Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2012\u201313 season&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Expedia%20%28website%29\"&gt;Expedia&lt;/a&gt; sponsored the officials, but this agreement ended after a year.\nFor the start of the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2013\u201314 Premier League&lt;/a&gt; season PGMOL had no sponsor, but part way through the season &lt;a href=\"EA%20Sports\"&gt;EA Sports&lt;/a&gt; signed a long term agreement which saw their logo on the arms of all officials in the Premier League and EFL until 2019.\nControversy.\nIn September 2016, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Halsey\"&gt;Mark Halsey&lt;/a&gt;, a former member and referee, claimed that PGMOL asked him to lie in match reports. PGMOL denied the claim, and no further action was taken.\nIn 2020, &lt;a href=\"HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs\"&gt;HMRC&lt;/a&gt; challenged the employment status of PGMOL appointed referees. The tax authority's case centred on the claim that referees should be treated as employees. However, the courts sided with PGMOL in handing down a decision that their referees are indeed self-employed."
