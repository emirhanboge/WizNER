    "text": "Mount Buggery is a mountain located in the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Shire\"&gt;Alpine Shire&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20National%20Park\"&gt;Alpine National Park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Alps\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain is located on the end of a ridgeline known as the Crosscut Saw between Mount Speculation and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Howitt\"&gt;Mount Howitt&lt;/a&gt;, both located to the south of Mount Buggery.\nThe summit of Mount Buggery rises in the range of &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Height%20Datum\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThere is circumstantial evidence that the mountain was named by a member of the Melbourne Walking Club who, during 1934, hiked along the &lt;a href=\"Buckland%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Buckland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Selwyn%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Mount Selwyn&lt;/a&gt;, and then on to the Barry Mountains to Mount Speculation, followed the Crosscut Saw to Mount Howitt, and finished at Merrijig via the &lt;a href=\"Howqua%20River\"&gt;Howqua River&lt;/a&gt;. Other members of the hiking party and within the Melbourne Walking Club started using the name, and it eventually appeared on maps; official acceptance followed."
