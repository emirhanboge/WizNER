He was best known for his spell at &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt;, as a coach and then manager, from 1970 to 1987. While at Ipswich, he was reserve team coach and first team coach in &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Robson\"&gt;Bobby Robson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;-winning teams, and was appointed manager after Robson's exit.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Dudley%2C%20North%20Tyneside\"&gt;Dudley, Northumberland&lt;/a&gt;, Ferguson's father &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Ferguson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201908%29\"&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt; and uncle &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Ferguson\"&gt;Ted&lt;/a&gt; were both professional footballers. Having represented England at schoolboy level, he began his career with &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;left back&lt;/a&gt;. He made only eleven league appearances over seven years as he was unable to displace &lt;a href=\"Alf%20McMichael\"&gt;Alf McMichael&lt;/a&gt; from the first-team.\nHe later played for &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; before joining &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; on 31 December 1965 for a fee of \u00a35,000. With Cardiff, he reached the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1967\u201368 European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; and made over 100 appearances in all competitions before losing his place in the side to &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Bell%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Gary Bell&lt;/a&gt;. He joined &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Town%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Barry Town&lt;/a&gt; in January 1969 as player-manager. However, six months later he returned to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; in the same role at &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt;, signing for a fee of \u00a3250. Replacing &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Graham%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Leslie Graham&lt;/a&gt;, he became the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31 but finished 21st in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt; in his first season. The club won re-election to stay in the Football League but a 6\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in November 1970 resulted in his dismissal.\nCoaching career.\nFerguson was appointed by fellow northeasterner &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Robson\"&gt;Bobby Robson&lt;/a&gt; into the coaching staff at &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. He was coach of the Ipswich team than won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Youth%20Cup\"&gt;FA Youth Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1973 and 1975, and as the reserve team coach he developed several young players including &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Butcher\"&gt;Terry Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Burley\"&gt;George Burley&lt;/a&gt;. While reserve team coach, he rejected the offer to manage &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt;. After Ipswich won the &lt;a href=\"1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1978 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, he replaced &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20Lea\"&gt;Cyril Lea&lt;/a&gt; as the first team coach, and the team went on to win the &lt;a href=\"1981%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1981 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1982, Robson left Ipswich to become &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team%20manager\"&gt;England national football team manager&lt;/a&gt;, and Ferguson was named the new Ipswich manager. His tenure was marked by financial constraints due to the construction of the Pioneer Stand at the team's &lt;a href=\"Portman%20Road\"&gt;Portman Road&lt;/a&gt; stadium. After several near misses, the club were relegated in 1986, and Ferguson was given an ultimatum that he would be dismissed if Ipswich were not promoted immediately back; they lost 2\u20131 on aggregate to &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Football%20League%20play-offs\"&gt;1987 play-off semi-finals&lt;/a&gt;. Ferguson became the first Ipswich manager to be sacked.\nAfter leaving Ipswich, Ferguson travelled to Kuwait to work as a coach for &lt;a href=\"Al-Arabi%20SC%20%28Kuwait%29\"&gt;Al-Arabi SC&lt;/a&gt;, managed by the Scotsman &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Mackay\"&gt;Dave Mackay&lt;/a&gt;. On returning to England, he had the same role for his former player Butcher's &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; and Mackay's &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life and death.\nFerguson settled in Ipswich. He spent his later life watching Ipswich Town and races at &lt;a href=\"Newmarket%20Racecourse\"&gt;Newmarket Racecourse&lt;/a&gt;, as well as playing golf. He and his wife Ann had a son and a daughter.\nFerguson died on 28 March 2018, at the age of 80. Ipswich announced that they plan to hold a minute's silence and wear black armbands at their next home match, against Millwall on 2 April 2018.\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nCardiff City\nManager.\nAl-Arabi \nIndividual"
