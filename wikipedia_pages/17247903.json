    "text": "The Cellar was a short-lived &lt;a href=\"music%20venue\"&gt;music venue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20Heights%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Arlington Heights, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; (outside of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;) that provided live early rock music in the mid-1960s to young people in the Chicago area. Founded in 1964 by Paul Sampson (a local &lt;a href=\"record%20shop\"&gt;record store&lt;/a&gt; owner who later became a music &lt;a href=\"Promoter%20%28entertainment%29\"&gt;promoter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"talent%20manager\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;) The Cellar primarily featured early &lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt; acts, although some Chicago &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; bands performed there as well. The Cellar closed in 1970. \nLocations.\nThe Cellar was first located in the basement (thus the name) of the old St. Peter's Lutheran Church at 116 W. Eastman St. It later moved to the empty Bill Cook Buick at 835 W. Davis, across the tracks from the old Arlington High School. The unused &lt;a href=\"warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; was located along the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway\"&gt;Chicago and Northwestern&lt;/a&gt; railroad tracks ().\nRock and roll youth culture legacy.\nThe Cellar became a notable venue for several reasons, providing teenagers from the region with a place to congregate, listen to British-tinged Chicago blues rock, and to &lt;a href=\"dance\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;. It was also notable because of its talented &lt;a href=\"psychedelic%20rock\"&gt;psychedelic rock&lt;/a&gt; regional &lt;a href=\"house%20band\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; bands, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Knight\"&gt;Shadows of Knight&lt;/a&gt; (who recorded their \"&lt;a href=\"Raw%20%27n%27%20Alive%20at%20the%20Cellar%2C%20Chicago%201966%21\"&gt;Raw 'n' Alive at the Cellar, Chicago 1966!&lt;/a&gt;\" album there), &lt;a href=\"The%20Ides%20of%20March%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Ides of March&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Buckinghams\"&gt;The Buckinghams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mauds\"&gt;The Mauds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H.%20P.%20Lovecraft%20%28band%29\"&gt;H.P. Lovecraft&lt;/a&gt;, Saturday's Children, &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Nugent\"&gt;Ted Nugent&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Amboy%20Dukes\"&gt;The Amboy Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, The Huns, &lt;a href=\"The%20Flock%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Flock&lt;/a&gt;, The Raevns, &lt;a href=\"The%20Other%20Half%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Other Half&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Little%20Boy%20Blues\"&gt;The Little Boy Blues&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the fact that it was a modest warehouse venue in a northwestern &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago, The Cellar attracted national and international &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; bands, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Who\"&gt;The Who&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cream\"&gt;The Cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Byrds\"&gt;The Byrds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Springfield\"&gt;Buffalo Springfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Spencer%20Davis%20Group\"&gt;The Spencer Davis Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Three%20Dog%20Night\"&gt;Three Dog Night&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Steve%20Miller%20Band\"&gt;The Steve Miller Band&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"MC5\"&gt;MC5&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cellar provided Chicago-area &lt;a href=\"garage%20rock\"&gt;garage rock&lt;/a&gt; bands with a stage and a teenage &lt;a href=\"audience\"&gt;audience&lt;/a&gt; eager to hear their loud rock music. Once on the stage, these groups gained regional and, in some cases (such as the Shadows of Knight), national followings. Furthermore, it provided these local groups with the extraordinary opportunity to open for the major acts who also played there, such as H.P. Lovecraft opening for The Who on June 15, 1967."
