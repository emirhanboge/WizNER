His rock band, \"SEIR\u00c8N\", was formed by his friends, and .\nOne day, Kai explores and meets , the &lt;a href=\"ningyo\"&gt;ningyo&lt;/a&gt; girl. The &lt;a href=\"Beat%20%28music%29\"&gt;music beat&lt;/a&gt; allows her &lt;a href=\"fish%20fin\"&gt;fish fin&lt;/a&gt; to transform into a pair of &lt;a href=\"human%20leg\"&gt;human leg&lt;/a&gt;s. The two strike up a friendship, and Kai takes Lu around the town for a tour. Kai learns that Lu cannot touch sunlight or she will burst into flames. He also learned that Lu has a papa and her mother was killed by a ship. Kai introduces Lu to Yuho and Kuino. When Kai accidentally reveals the secret of the merfolk to the townspeople, Lu's love and power of music makes them &lt;a href=\"dance\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; around town. Despite Kai's &lt;a href=\"selfishness\"&gt;selfishness&lt;/a&gt;, videos of Lu go viral and she becomes a celebrity. Inspired by her popularity, Y\u016bho's grandfather reopens an old merfolk-themed amusement park on an island near the town. Kai becomes disinterested in the band and begins to ignore Lu. SEIR\u00c8N plays the park's opening, but after Lu arrives and steals the show, Y\u016bho becomes upset and runs away.\nMeanwhile, anti-merfolk feelings have been rising in the town, and when Y\u016bho cannot be found by her father, he puts the blame on Lu and captures her. As he threatens her with sunlight, Lu's father comes to save her, which triggers a curse that begins to flood the town. Kai and Y\u016bho help Lu and her father escape, who in turn rally other merfolk to help the town escape the rising waters. In the process of helping, the merfolk destroy the natural cliff which shades the bay from the sun, exposing themselves as the dawn breaks. As the threat of the curse disperses, the townspeople gather themselves and use many umbrellas to save all sea creatures from the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nKai apologizes to Lu and everyone dances happily until all sea creatures return to the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Kai starts a new life in town.\nProduction.\nYuasa announced on his &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he was working on the film in January 2017. It was animated in a hybrid form in which &lt;a href=\"key%20frame\"&gt;key frame&lt;/a&gt;s were drawn on paper, but instead of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Cleanup%20%28animation%29\"&gt;clean-up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inbetweening\"&gt;inbetweening&lt;/a&gt; still used in most Japanese &lt;a href=\"traditional%20animation\"&gt;traditional animation&lt;/a&gt; at the time, these rough key frames were then &lt;a href=\"Image%20tracing\"&gt;traced&lt;/a&gt; and inbetweened in &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20Flash\"&gt;Adobe Flash&lt;/a&gt;.\nYuasa acknowledged that \"Lu\" shares some similar plot elements and the visual subject of water with &lt;a href=\"Hayao%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hayao Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;'s film \"&lt;a href=\"Ponyo\"&gt;Ponyo&lt;/a&gt;\", and that it occurred to him late into the production of \"Lu\". He considers this due to the influence on him of Miyazaki and &lt;a href=\"Isao%20Takahata\"&gt;Isao Takahata&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Panda%21%20Go%2C%20Panda%21\"&gt;Panda! Go, Panda!: Rainy-day Circus&lt;/a&gt;\", which Miyazaki reused elements of himself in \"Ponyo\", and is happy for his works to include such homages to works he admires.\n&lt;a href=\"Kazuyoshi%20Saito\"&gt;Kazuyoshi Saito&lt;/a&gt;'s 1997 song was chosen to be the theme song of the film.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nOn &lt;a href=\"review%20aggregator\"&gt;review aggregator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, the film holds a 78% approval rating based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"\"Lu Over the Wall\" can be more fun to watch than to follow, but director Masaaki Yuasa's distinctive visual style offers colorful compensation for an occasionally scattered story.\" &lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nCharles Solomon from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"Yuasa's bold imagery and sometimes convoluted storytelling defy the conventions of traditional animated filmmaking, but he is clearly an artist with an individual vision whose work offers something genuinely new and eye-catching.\"\nOn the other hand, Simon Abrams from RogerEbert.com said \"Still, I can't lie: I was bored throughout the 112 minutes I spent watching \"Lu over the Wall\". I initially thought that I was allergic to the mediocre English voice actors' performances. But I soon realized that that my biggest problem was that I couldn't reconcile the basic disconnect between the thrilling story-telling and the paint-by-numbers story. I wanted the film's creators to do something with their formulaic narrative, but they never did.\""
