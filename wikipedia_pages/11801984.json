    "title": "Pearl barley",
    "text": "Pearl barley, or pearled barley, is &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; that has been processed to remove its fibrous outer &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28botany%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; and polished to remove some or all of the &lt;a href=\"bran\"&gt;bran&lt;/a&gt; layer.\nIt is the most common form of barley for human consumption because it cooks faster and is less chewy than other, less-processed forms of the grain such as \"hulled barley\" (or \"barley &lt;a href=\"groats\"&gt;groats&lt;/a&gt;\", also known as \"pot barley\" and \"Scotch barley\"). Fine &lt;a href=\"barley%20flour\"&gt;barley flour&lt;/a&gt; is prepared from milled pearl barley.\nPearl barley is similar to wheat in its caloric, protein, vitamin and mineral content, though some varieties are higher in &lt;a href=\"lysine\"&gt;lysine&lt;/a&gt;. It is used mainly in soups, stews, and &lt;a href=\"potage\"&gt;potage&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the primary ingredient of the Italian dish &lt;a href=\"orzotto\"&gt;orzotto&lt;/a&gt; and one of the main ingredients of the Jewish dish &lt;a href=\"Cholent\"&gt;Cholent&lt;/a&gt;."
