    "text": "The PAX Association () was a pro-&lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; organization created in 1947 in the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;People's Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt; at the onset of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Poland%20%281945%E2%80%931989%29%23Stalinist%20era%20%281948%E2%80%931956%29\"&gt;the Stalinist period&lt;/a&gt;. The association published the \"S\u0142owo Powszechne\" daily for almost fifty years between 1947 and 1993 with an average of 312 issues annually.\nThe first editor-in-chief of \"S\u0142owo Powszechne\" (circulation: 40,000) was Wojciech K\u0119trzy\u0144ski (d. 1983) from &lt;a href=\"Konfederacja%20Narodu\"&gt;KN&lt;/a&gt;, grandson of historian &lt;a href=\"Wojciech%20K%C4%99trzy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Wojciech K\u0119trzy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. In 1982 the newspaper adjusted its name to \"S\u0142owo Powszechne: dziennik Stowarzyszenia PAX\" (the \"PAX Association Daily\"). The publication closed only when the PAX ceased to function in 1993, following the &lt;a href=\"collapse%20of%20communism\"&gt;collapse of communism&lt;/a&gt;; however, the facsimile of the association was reestablished in 1993 under a different name: the Catholic association \"&lt;a href=\"Civitas%20Christiana\"&gt;Civitas Christiana&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNotably, in 1953 the PAX gave its support to the &lt;a href=\"Stalinist%20show%20trial%20of%20the%20Krak%C3%B3w%20Curia\"&gt;Stalinist show trial of the Krak\u00f3w Curia&lt;/a&gt; pronouncing death penalties for the Catholic priests accused of treason, and took over the publication of the Catholic weekly magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Tygodnik%20Powszechny\"&gt;Tygodnik Powszechny&lt;/a&gt;\" until the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20October\"&gt;Polish October&lt;/a&gt; of 1956.\nCommunist era.\nFollowing the Soviet takeover, the PAX Association had been formed with the intention to undermine grass-roots support for the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stalinism%20in%20Poland\"&gt;Stalinist Poland&lt;/a&gt;. Created by &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20Piasecki\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw Piasecki&lt;/a&gt;, it approved the trial and imprisonment of many Polish clergymen, among them &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Czes%C5%82aw%20Kaczmarek\"&gt;Czes\u0142aw Kaczmarek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. PAX attempted to compete with the conservative clergy of the interwar era over public policy issues, especially after the arrest of hundreds of priests by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;the state security&lt;/a&gt; in early 1950s. The government gave it total control over the Polish branch of the &lt;a href=\"Caritas%20%28charity%29\"&gt;Caritas&lt;/a&gt; relief organisation. According to &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Davies\"&gt;Norman Davies&lt;/a&gt; PAX was an &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; front organisation, set up to win over Polish Catholics to communism, and to break their links to the Vatican. It maintained a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt;, winning, for example, five seats in the &lt;a href=\"1969%20Polish%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1969 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nReforms.\nAfter 1956, together with many other similar government initiatives, it was toned down and took a more compromising position, in some regards even supporting the leniency for the &lt;a href=\"Anti-communist%20resistance%20in%20Poland%20%281944%E2%80%931989%29\"&gt;anti-communist resistance in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, even though it firmly endorsed the communist government of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;People's Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20communism\"&gt;fall of communism&lt;/a&gt;. After 1982 it was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Patriotic%20Movement%20for%20National%20Rebirth\"&gt;Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the decades after its creation and the death of Stalin, it continued to steadily lose power and influence, although it still exists in modern Poland."
