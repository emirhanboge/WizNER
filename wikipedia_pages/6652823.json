    "text": "The R\u00e9seau Sentinelles or the French GPs' Sentinelles Network is a &lt;a href=\"Social%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; of 1 314 volunteer &lt;a href=\"general%20practitioner\"&gt;general practitioner&lt;/a&gt;s and 116 &lt;a href=\"pediatrician\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt;s, working throughout the metropolitan regions of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (respectively 2.1% and 4.3% of the total general practitioners and pediatricians in these regions). Its goal is to provide &lt;a href=\"clinical%20surveillance\"&gt;clinical surveillance&lt;/a&gt; in France for 10 &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; indicators. This network, created in November 1984 by Professor &lt;a href=\"Alain-Jacques%20Valleron\"&gt;Alain-Jacques Valleron&lt;/a&gt;, is regulated under the auspices of the mixed research unit U1136 of &lt;a href=\"Institut%20National%20de%20la%20Sant%C3%A9%20et%20de%20la%20Recherche%20M%C3%A9dicale\"&gt;Inserm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorbonne%20University\"&gt;Sorbonne University&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuous surveillance of 10 health indicators.\nThis national system of &lt;a href=\"clinical%20surveillance\"&gt;clinical surveillance&lt;/a&gt; collects real-time epidemiological data, originating from the participating general practitioners, to be used in &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forecasting\"&gt;forecasting&lt;/a&gt; and redistribution. It is also a part of the surveillance warning system directed by French national agency of public health (Sant\u00e9 publique France) (receiving the &lt;a href=\"CNIL\"&gt;CNIL&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s favorable recommendation n\u00b0471 393).\nThe 10 health indicators surveyed are 9 &lt;a href=\"infectious%20disease\"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;s:\nand 1 non &lt;a href=\"infectious%20disease\"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;s:\nThe surveillance system detects, alerts, and predicts future regional and national epidemics specifically for influenza, gastroenteritis and Varicella zoster.\nThe patient de-identified data is obtained via &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; by the Sentinelles doctors and directly streamed into a &lt;a href=\"Geographic%20information%20system\"&gt;Geographic information system&lt;/a&gt; (GIS) database. A weekly report, called Sentiweb-Hebdo, is edited every Tuesday on the home webpage of the Sentinelle Network and is emailed to more than 10000 subscribers, including members of the national media. An annual report of the number of cases reported is also edited using the surveillance data. These reports are available for online viewing, and can be accessed on the Sentinelles home webpage in the section titled \"documentation/bilans annuels\" (or \u201cannual reports and totals\u201d).\nScientific research.\nThe data provided by the Sentinelles Network had provided research in the following domains:\nField epidemiology.\nEpidemiological inquiries are regularly performed among the Sentinelles doctors. Their purpose is to maintain the ethical conduct of epidemiological research developed by the \u201cAssociation des \u00e9pid\u00e9miogistes de langue fran\u00e7aise\u201d, or the Association of Epidemiologists of the French Language. The order of each inquiry is prespecified in a written protocol. The inquiries are then summarized in a final report and submitted per protocol to the internal auditors to assure their quality. All reports thus far have received a favorable recommendation by the CNIL (n\u00b0471 393). The results of these inquiries are available online and can be accessed via the Sentinelle home webpage in the section \"documentation/enqu\u00eates ponctuelles\" (or \u201cregular inquiry documentation\u201d)."
