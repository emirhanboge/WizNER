    "text": "Buzzinbees is a privately owned company that develops software and sells it to telecommunication equipment and software vendors. It is based in Seyssinet-Pariset near &lt;a href=\"Grenoble\"&gt;Grenoble&lt;/a&gt; in France. It was founded in 2009 by its current CEO Jean-Ren\u00e9 Bouvier. Buzzinbees's products are currently active in more than 135 countries worldwide. In December 2015, &lt;a href=\"Gemalto\"&gt;Gemalto&lt;/a&gt; acquired Buzzinbees for an undisclosed amount. Olivier Piou stated that the acquisition was motivated by Buzzinbees activation solution, especially for machine to machine.\nHistory.\nBuzzinbees was created by &lt;a href=\"Hewlett-Packard\"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; senior executives in October 2009. A strategic licensing agreement with the IT giant allows Buzzinbees to continue to develop and enhance products that have been deployed for more than 20 years by HP (it is acknowledged that HP started to provide telecommunication operators and equipment providers with carrier grade &lt;a href=\"Signalling%20%28telecommunications%29\"&gt;signaling&lt;/a&gt; as soon as 1988).\nHP has become one of Buzzinbees's customers, buying signaling platforms as well as other products to embed them into its telecommunication solutions.\nIn February 2010, Buzzinbees announced its collaboration with PT on a messaging server: Bee-IRON. The Bee-IRON platform is a flagship product from Buzzinbees which can deliver and route 2,500 &lt;a href=\"SMS\"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; per second in a single node. It complements PT's MicroTCA server.\nIn May 2010, Buzzinbees focused its attention on automatic &lt;a href=\"Subscriber%20identity%20module\"&gt;SIM&lt;/a&gt; activation, targeting fast growing markets such as African, Asian and Latin American operators. This effort became visible at the 2012 next generation telecom summit in Nairobi.\nBuzzinbees's name was inspired by the highly social communicating &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s. Indeed, bees do \n&lt;a href=\"Bee%20learning%20and%20communication\"&gt;communicate&lt;/a&gt; in order to recruit other worker bees to forage in the same area they found flowers. The Buzzinbees logo \u2014 pictured left \u2014 \"sports a hexagonal cell\" reminiscent of \"honeycombs but also cellular networks\" as well as 3 pairs of bee \"antennas\".\nIn November 2015, Buzzinbees's CEO created another company, Facts Haven SAS with a new logo. Following the Gemalto acquisition, his &lt;a href=\"LinkedIn\"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; profile indicates that he no longer works for Buzzinbees. However, the Buzzinbees company still exists as a legal entity.\nProducts.\nBuzzinbees's portfolio encompasses &lt;a href=\"Node%20%28networking%29\"&gt;network nodes&lt;/a&gt; built atop a comprehensive suite of signaling products providing complete development &lt;a href=\"Computing%20platform\"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; based on global telecommunication standards and protocols.\nThese products work indeed with &lt;a href=\"Signaling%20System%207\"&gt;SS7&lt;/a&gt; (signaling system #7), &lt;a href=\"IP%20Multimedia%20Subsystem\"&gt;IMS&lt;/a&gt; (IP multimedia subsystem) and &lt;a href=\"3GPP%20Long%20Term%20Evolution\"&gt;LTE&lt;/a&gt; (long term evolution) protocols. They augment networks with intelligent functions (&lt;a href=\"intelligent%20network\"&gt;intelligent network&lt;/a&gt;).\nBuzzinbees's distribution channel is very specific: it sells to independent software vendors and equipment providers, as opposed to selling directly to operators.\nSince 2011, Buzzinbees openly focused on automatic SIM activation and the nascent &lt;a href=\"machine%20to%20machine\"&gt;machine to machine&lt;/a&gt; market, pushing their Bee-SOON (SIM on-off node) product. Following the Gemalto acquisition, it introduced the concept of SIM reactivation whereby operators can let users reuse expired &lt;a href=\"Subscriber%20identity%20module\"&gt;SIM&lt;/a&gt; cards instead of purchasing new ones when they wish to re-subscribe to that operator."
