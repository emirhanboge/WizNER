    "text": "The history of games dates to the ancient human past. &lt;a href=\"Game\"&gt;Game&lt;/a&gt;s are an integral part of all cultures and are one of the oldest forms of human social interaction. Games are formalized expressions of play which allow people to go beyond immediate &lt;a href=\"imagination\"&gt;imagination&lt;/a&gt; and direct physical activity. Common features of games include uncertainty of outcome, agreed upon rules, competition, separate place and time, elements of fiction, elements of chance, prescribed goals and personal enjoyment.\nGames capture the ideas and worldviews of their cultures and pass them on to the future generation. Games were important as cultural and social bonding events, as teaching tools and as markers of social status. As pastimes of royalty and the elite, some games became common features of &lt;a href=\"Court%20%28royal%29\"&gt;court culture&lt;/a&gt; and were also given as gifts. Games such as &lt;a href=\"Senet\"&gt;Senet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20ball%20game\"&gt;Mesoamerican ball game&lt;/a&gt; were often imbued with mythic and ritual religious significance. Games like &lt;a href=\"Gyan%20chauper\"&gt;Gyan chauper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Mansion%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;The Mansion of Happiness&lt;/a&gt; were used to teach spiritual and ethical lessons while &lt;a href=\"Shatranj\"&gt;Shatranj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"W%C3%A9iq%C3%AD\"&gt;W\u00e9iq\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; (Go) were seen as a way to develop strategic thinking and mental skill by the political and military elite.\nIn his 1938 book, \"&lt;a href=\"Homo%20Ludens\"&gt;Homo Ludens&lt;/a&gt;\", Dutch cultural historian &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Huizinga\"&gt;Johan Huizinga&lt;/a&gt; argued that games were a primary condition of the generation of human cultures. Huizinga saw the playing of games as something that \"is older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing\". Huizinga saw games as a starting point for complex human activities such as language, law, war, philosophy and art.\nPre-modern.\nSome of the most common pre-historic and ancient gaming tools were made of bone, especially from the &lt;a href=\"Talus%20bone\"&gt;Talus bone&lt;/a&gt;, these have been found worldwide and are the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"knucklebones\"&gt;knucklebones&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"dice%20games\"&gt;dice games&lt;/a&gt;. These bones were also sometimes used for oracular and divinatory functions. Other implements could have included shells, stones and sticks.\nIn ancient civilizations there was no clear distinction between &lt;a href=\"Sacred%E2%80%93profane%20dichotomy\"&gt;the sacred and the profane&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Durkheim\"&gt;Durkheim&lt;/a&gt;, games were founded in a religious setting and were a cornerstone of social bonding.\nMiddle East and the Mediterranean.\nA series of 49 small carved painted stones found at the 5,000-year-old &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%9Fur%20H%C3%B6y%C3%BCk\"&gt;Ba\u015fur H\u00f6y\u00fck&lt;/a&gt; burial mound in southeast &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; could represent the earliest gaming pieces ever found. Similar pieces have been found in &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and seem to point to board games having originated in the &lt;a href=\"Fertile%20Crescent\"&gt;Fertile Crescent&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest board games seem to have been a pastime for the elite and were sometimes given as diplomatic gifts.\nAmong the earliest examples of a board game is \"&lt;a href=\"senet\"&gt;senet&lt;/a&gt;\", a game found in &lt;a href=\"Predynastic%20Egypt\"&gt;Predynastic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;First Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; burial sites in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; (circa 3500 BCE and 3100 BCE, respectively) and in &lt;a href=\"hieroglyphs\"&gt;hieroglyphs&lt;/a&gt; dating to around 3100 BCE. The game was played by moving draughtsmen on a board of 30 squares arranged into three parallel rows of ten squares each. The players strategically moved their pieces based on the throw of sticks or bones. The goal was to reach the edge of the board first. Senet slowly evolved to reflect the religious beliefs of the Egyptians. The pieces represented human souls and their movement was based on the journey of the soul in the afterlife. Each square had a distinct religious significance, with the final square being associated with the union of the soul with the sun god &lt;a href=\"Re-Horakhty\"&gt;Re-Horakhty&lt;/a&gt;. Senet may have also been used in a ritual religious context. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Game%20of%20Ur\"&gt;Royal Game of Ur&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Game of Twenty Squares\" was played with a set of pawns on a richly decorated board and dates from about 3000 BCE. It was a &lt;a href=\"race%20game\"&gt;race game&lt;/a&gt; which employed a set of knucklebone dice. This game was also known and played in Egypt. A Babylonian treatise on the game written on a clay tablet shows that the game had astronomical significance and that it could also be used to tell one's fortune. Many evidenceThe Ur game was also popular with the lower classes, as attested by a 2,700-year-old graffiti version of the game, scratched onto a gateway to a palace in &lt;a href=\"Khorsabad\"&gt;Khorsabad&lt;/a&gt;. Similar games have been found in Iran, Crete, Cyprus, Sri Lanka, and Syria. Excavations at &lt;a href=\"Shahr-e%20Sukhteh\"&gt;Shahr-e Sukhteh&lt;/a&gt; (\"The Burnt City\") in &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; have shown that the game also existed there around 3000 BCE. The artifacts include two dice and 60 checkers. Games such as &lt;a href=\"Nard%20%28game%29\"&gt;Nard&lt;/a&gt; and the Roman game &lt;a href=\"Ludus%20Duodecim%20Scriptorum\"&gt;Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum&lt;/a&gt; (game of 12 points, also known as simply \"dice\", lat. \"alea\") may have developed from this Iranian game. The Byzantine game &lt;a href=\"Tabula%20%28game%29\"&gt;Tabula&lt;/a&gt; is a descendant of the game of twelve points.\nThe other example of a board game in ancient Egypt is \u201c&lt;a href=\"Hounds%20and%20Jackals\"&gt;Hounds and Jackals&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, also known as 58 holes. Hounds and Jackals appeared in Egypt, around 2000 BC and was mainly popular in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Middle Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The game was spread to Mesopotamia in the late 3rd millennium BC and was popular until the 1st millennium BC. More than 68 gameboards of Hounds and Jackals have been discovered in the archaeological excavations in various territories, including &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; (Tell Ajlun, &lt;a href=\"Ras%20al-Ayn\"&gt;Ras el-Ain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khafajah\"&gt;Khafaje&lt;/a&gt;), Israel (&lt;a href=\"Beit%20She%27an\"&gt;Tel Beth Shean&lt;/a&gt;, Gezer), &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Uruk\"&gt;Uruk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nippur\"&gt;Nippur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nineveh\"&gt;Nineveh&lt;/a&gt;, Ashur, &lt;a href=\"Babylon\"&gt;Babylon&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tepe%20Sialk\"&gt;Tappeh Sialk&lt;/a&gt;, Susa, &lt;a href=\"Lorestan%20Province\"&gt;Luristan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Karah%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%2C%20Kalecik\"&gt;Karalhuyuk&lt;/a&gt;, Kultepe, &lt;a href=\"Acemh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk\"&gt;Acemhuyuk&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gobustan%20National%20Park\"&gt;Gobustan&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; (Buhen, &lt;a href=\"El%20Lahun\"&gt;El-Lahun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sedment\"&gt;Sedment&lt;/a&gt;). It was a race game for two players. The gaming board consisted of two sets of 29 holes. Ten small pegs with either jackal or dog heads were used for playing. It's believed that the aim of the game was to begin at one point on the board and to reach with all figures at the other point on the board.\nIn Ancient Greece and in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, popular games included ball games (&lt;a href=\"Episkyros\"&gt;Episkyros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harpastum\"&gt;Harpastum&lt;/a&gt;, Expulsim Ludere - a kind of &lt;a href=\"handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;), dice games (Tesserae), &lt;a href=\"knucklebones\"&gt;knucklebones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20games\"&gt;Bear games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tic-tac-toe\"&gt;Tic-tac-toe&lt;/a&gt; (Terni Lapilli), &lt;a href=\"Nine%20men%27s%20morris\"&gt;Nine men's morris&lt;/a&gt; (mola) and various types of board games similar to &lt;a href=\"checkers\"&gt;checkers&lt;/a&gt;. Both Plato and Homer mention board games called 'petteia' (games played with pessoi', i.e. 'pieces' or 'men'). According to Plato, they are all Egyptian in origin. The name 'petteia' seems to be a generic term for board game and refers to various games. One such game was called 'poleis' (city states) and was a game of battle on a checkered board.\nThe Romans played a derivation of 'petteia' called 'latrunculin' or &lt;a href=\"Ludus%20latrunculorum\"&gt;Ludus latrunculorum&lt;/a&gt; (the soldiers' game or the bandits' game). It is first mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Varro\"&gt;Varro&lt;/a&gt; (116\u201327 BCE) and alluded to by Martial and &lt;a href=\"Ovid\"&gt;Ovid&lt;/a&gt;. This game was extremely popular and was spread throughout Europe by the Romans. Boards have been found as far as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman Britain&lt;/a&gt;. It was a war game for two players and included moving around counters representing soldiers, with 'custodian' captures made by getting one of the adversary's pieces between two of one's own.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Muslim conquest of Persia&lt;/a&gt; (638-651) &lt;a href=\"Shatranj\"&gt;Shatranj&lt;/a&gt; spread to the Arab world. While pre-Islamic chess sets represented Elephants, Horses, Kings and Soldiers; the Islamic prohibition against image worship led to increasing abstraction in chess set design. Islamic chess pieces were therefore simple cylindrical and rectangular shapes. The game became immensely popular during &lt;a href=\"Abbasid%20Caliphate\"&gt;Abbasid Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; of the 9th century. The Abbasid Caliphs &lt;a href=\"Harun%20al-Rashid\"&gt;Harun al-Rashid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al-Ma%27mun\"&gt;Al-Ma'mun&lt;/a&gt; were avid Shatranj players. During this period Muslim chess players published several treatises on &lt;a href=\"chess%20problems\"&gt;chess problems&lt;/a&gt; (\"mansubat\") and &lt;a href=\"chess%20openings\"&gt;chess openings&lt;/a&gt; (\"ta'biyat\"). Elite players such as Al-Adli, &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakr%20bin%20Yahya%20al-Suli\"&gt;al-Suli&lt;/a&gt; and Ar-Razi were called \"aliyat\" or \"grandees\" and played at the courts of the &lt;a href=\"Caliphs\"&gt;Caliphs&lt;/a&gt; and wrote about the game. Al-Adli (800-870) is known for writing Kitab ash-shatranj (book of chess), a comprehensive work on the game, including history, openings, endgames and chess problems. Al-Adli also developed a system for ranking players. During the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Turko-Mongol\"&gt;Turko-Mongol&lt;/a&gt; conqueror &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; (1336\u20131405), a variant of chess known as &lt;a href=\"Tamerlane%20chess\"&gt;Tamerlane chess&lt;/a&gt; was developed which some sources attribute to Timur himself who was known to be a fan of the game.\nVarious games in the &lt;a href=\"Tables%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Tables family&lt;/a&gt; were also quite popular and are known as \"ifranjiah\" in Arabic (meaning \"Frankish\") and as &lt;a href=\"Nard%20%28game%29\"&gt;Nard&lt;/a&gt; in Iran. Many of the early Arabic texts which refer to these games often debate the legality and morality of playing them. This debate was settled by the eighth century when all four Muslim schools of jurisprudence declared them to be &lt;a href=\"Haraam\"&gt;Haraam&lt;/a&gt; (forbidden), however they are still played today in many Arab countries. Other popular games included &lt;a href=\"Mancala\"&gt;Mancala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2b\"&gt;T\u00e2b&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Polo\"&gt;Polo&lt;/a&gt; (Persian: \"chawgan\", Arabic: \"sawlajan\") was first played in &lt;a href=\"Sassanid%20Persia\"&gt;Sassanid Persia&lt;/a&gt;. It passed from Sassanid Persia to the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; at an early date, and a &lt;a href=\"Tzykanisterion\"&gt;Tzykanisterion&lt;/a&gt; (stadium for playing polo) was built by emperor &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20II\"&gt;Theodosius II&lt;/a&gt; (r. 408\u2013450) inside the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Palace%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Great Palace of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquests\"&gt;Muslim conquests&lt;/a&gt;, it passed to the &lt;a href=\"Ayyubid\"&gt;Ayyubid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mameluke\"&gt;Mameluke&lt;/a&gt; dynasties, whose elites favored it above all other sports. Notable &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Saladin\"&gt;Saladin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baybars\"&gt;Baybars&lt;/a&gt; were known to play it and encourage it in their court.\n&lt;a href=\"Playing%20cards\"&gt;Playing cards&lt;/a&gt; were imported from Asia and India and were popular during &lt;a href=\"Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29\"&gt;Mamluk Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; Egypt, featuring polo sticks, coins, swords, and cups as suits.\nIndia.\nIndia saw a number of games in ancient period ranging from the various dice games to other board games. The use of cubical and oblong dice was common in the \"Indus Valley\" &lt;a href=\"Harappan%20civilization\"&gt;Harappan civilization&lt;/a&gt; (c. 2300 BC). Archaeological excavations have found gambling dice in monasteries and other Buddhist sites. The earliest textual mention of games in India is the &lt;a href=\"Rig-Veda\"&gt;Rig-Veda&lt;/a&gt;'s mention of the use of dice (c. 1000 BC). Texts such as the Mahabharata indicate that dice games were popular with Kings and royalty, and also had ceremonial purposes. &lt;a href=\"Cowry\"&gt;Cowry&lt;/a&gt; shells were also widely used.\nAnother early reference is the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Buddha%20games\"&gt;list of Buddha games&lt;/a&gt; (circa 500 BC) which is a list from the &lt;a href=\"Pali%20Canon\"&gt;Pali Canon&lt;/a&gt; that Buddhist monks were forbidden to play. This list mentions games on boards with 8 or 10 rows (&lt;a href=\"Ashtapada\"&gt;Ashtapada&lt;/a&gt; and Da\u015bapada), games which use floor diagrams (one game called Parih\u00e2ra-patham is similar to &lt;a href=\"hop-scotch\"&gt;hop-scotch&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"dice%20games\"&gt;dice games&lt;/a&gt; and ball games. \"Ashtapada and Da\u015bapada\" were &lt;a href=\"race%20games\"&gt;race games&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaturanga\"&gt;Chaturanga&lt;/a&gt; (which means 'quadripartite' and also 'army'), the predecessor of Chess, possibly developed in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20subcontinent\"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Kushan\"&gt;Kushan&lt;/a&gt; (30\u2013375 CE) or &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta&lt;/a&gt; (320\u2013550 CE) periods from an amalgamation of other game features and was transmitted to &lt;a href=\"Sassanid%20Persia\"&gt;Sassanid Persia&lt;/a&gt; (where it was known as &lt;a href=\"Shatranj\"&gt;Shatranj&lt;/a&gt;) and China through the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Road\"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;. It was divided into four parts called angas, which were symbolic of the four branches of an army. Just like the real ancient Indian army, it had pieces called elephants, chariots, horses and soldiers, and was played to devise war strategies.\nCheckmate comes from the Persian term in the game, \u2018Shah-Mat\u2019, meaning 'the king is dead'. Another game named &lt;a href=\"Chaturaji\"&gt;Chaturaji&lt;/a&gt; was similar but played with four sides of differing colors instead of two, however the earliest source for this four sided board game is &lt;a href=\"Al-Biruni\"&gt;Al-Biruni&lt;/a&gt;'s 'India', circa 1030 AD. Historians of Chess such as &lt;a href=\"Yuri%20Averbakh\"&gt;Yuri Averbakh&lt;/a&gt; have surmised that the Greek board game \"petteia\" may have had an influence on the development of early Chaturanga. \"Petteia\" games could have combined with other elements in the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom\"&gt;Greco-Bactrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indo-Greek%20Kingdom\"&gt;Indo-Greek&lt;/a&gt; Kingdoms.\nThe game of &lt;a href=\"Carrom\"&gt;Carrom&lt;/a&gt; is said to have originated in the Indian subcontinent. Though there isn't any particular proof, it is said that Indian Maharajas invented the game centuries ago. There was a finding of an ancient glass carrom board in \"Patiala, Punjab\". Carrom gained popularity after World War I, and is still a widely popular board game in India.\nAdding on, the game of Snakes and Ladders was previously known as &lt;a href=\"Snakes%20and%20ladders\"&gt;Vaikuntapaali&lt;/a&gt;. \"Vaikuntapaali\" - which was originally a Hindu game. It has been speculated that this game was already being played in India as early as the 2 nd century AD. Others have credited the invention of the game to Dnyaneshwar (known also as Dnyandev), a Marathi saint who lived during the 13 th century AD. This game is also known by names like \"Gyan Chaupar\" (meaning 'Game of Knowledge), \"Mokshapat\", and \"Moksha Patamu.\"\nThe game now known as Ludo - was then called Pachisi (/p\u0259\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0zi/). The board was made out of cloth or jute. A depiction of Pachisi is found in the caves of &lt;a href=\"Ajanta%20Caves\"&gt;Ajanta Caves&lt;/a&gt;in Maharashtra, showing that the game was quite popular in the Medieval Era. &lt;a href=\"Cross%20and%20circle%20games\"&gt;Cross and circle games&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Chaupar\"&gt;Chaupar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pachisi\"&gt;Pachisi&lt;/a&gt; may be very old games, but so far their history has not been established prior to the 16th century. &lt;a href=\"Chaupar\"&gt;Chaupar&lt;/a&gt; was a popular gambling game at the court of &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Akbar%20the%20Great\"&gt;Akbar the Great&lt;/a&gt; (1556-1605). The emperor himself was a fan of the game and was known to play on a courtyard of his palace using slaves as playing pieces. \"Karuna Sharma of Georgia State University\", in her research paper \u2013\"\"A visit to the mughal harem: Lives of Royal Women\"\" noted the political side of these board games played at the court.\nEast Asia.\nThe extinct Chinese board game \"&lt;a href=\"liubo\"&gt;liubo&lt;/a&gt;\" was invented no later than the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, and was popular during the &lt;a href=\"Warring%20States%20period\"&gt;Warring States period&lt;/a&gt; (476 BCE \u2013 221 BCE) and the Han Dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE). Although the game's rules have been lost, it was apparently a &lt;a href=\"race%20game\"&gt;race game&lt;/a&gt; not unlike &lt;a href=\"Senet\"&gt;Senet&lt;/a&gt; in that playing pieces were moved about a board using sticks thrown to determine movement.\n&lt;a href=\"Go%20%28game%29\"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Weiqi\", \"Igo\", or \"Baduk\" (in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, respectively), is first mentioned in the historical annal \"&lt;a href=\"Zuo%20Zhuan\"&gt;Zuo Zhuan&lt;/a&gt;\" (c. 4th century BC). It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the \"&lt;a href=\"Analects%20of%20Confucius\"&gt;Analects of Confucius&lt;/a&gt;\" and in two of the books of &lt;a href=\"Mencius\"&gt;Mencius&lt;/a&gt; (c. 3rd century BC). In ancient &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, Go was one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Arts%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Scholar\"&gt;four cultivated arts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Junzi\"&gt;Chinese scholar gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20calligraphy\"&gt;calligraphy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; and playing the musical instrument &lt;a href=\"guqin\"&gt;guqin&lt;/a&gt;, and examinations of skill in those arts was used to qualify candidates for service in the &lt;a href=\"bureaucracy\"&gt;bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;. Go was brought to Korea in the second century BC when the Han Dynasty expanded into the Korean peninsula and it arrived in Japan in the 5th or 6th century AD and it quickly became a favorite aristocratic pastime.\nChinese Chess or &lt;a href=\"Xiangqi\"&gt;Xiangqi&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been played during the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, any earlier attestation is problematic. Several Xiangqi pieces are known from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1126). It is unknown exactly how &lt;a href=\"Xiangqi\"&gt;Xiangqi&lt;/a&gt; developed. Other traditional East Asian Chess variants include &lt;a href=\"Shogi\"&gt;Shogi&lt;/a&gt; (Japan) and &lt;a href=\"Janggi\"&gt;Janggi&lt;/a&gt; (Korea). \n&lt;a href=\"Playing%20cards\"&gt;Playing cards&lt;/a&gt; or tiles were invented in China as early as the 9th century &lt;a href=\"Science%20and%20technology%20of%20the%20Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;during the Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (618\u2013907). The earliest unambiguous attestation of paper playing cards date back to 1294.\nThe modern game of &lt;a href=\"Dominoes\"&gt;Dominoes&lt;/a&gt; developed from early Chinese &lt;a href=\"tile%20based%20games\"&gt;tile based games&lt;/a&gt;. What appears to have been the earliest references to gaming tiles are mentions of \"kwat pai\", or \"bone tiles\", used in gambling, in Chinese writings no later than 900 AD. The earliest definite references to &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20dominoes\"&gt;Chinese dominoes&lt;/a&gt; are found in the literature of the &lt;a href=\"Song%20Dynasty%20%28960-1279%29\"&gt;Song Dynasty (960-1279)&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt;-style &lt;a href=\"dominoes\"&gt;dominoes&lt;/a&gt; are a more recent variation, with the earliest examples being of early-18th century Italian design. The modern tile game &lt;a href=\"Mahjong\"&gt;Mahjong&lt;/a&gt; is based on older Chinese &lt;a href=\"card%20game\"&gt;card game&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"Khanhoo\"&gt;Khanhoo&lt;/a&gt;, peng hu, and shi hu.\nThe pre-modern Chinese also played &lt;a href=\"ball%20games\"&gt;ball games&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Cuju\"&gt;Cuju&lt;/a&gt; which was a ball and net game similar to football, and &lt;a href=\"Chuiwan\"&gt;Chuiwan&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to modern &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfrica.\nThe most widespread of the native African games is &lt;a href=\"Mancala\"&gt;Mancala&lt;/a&gt;. Mancala is a family of board games played around the world, sometimes called \"&lt;a href=\"sowing\"&gt;sowing&lt;/a&gt;\" games, or \"count-and-capture\" games, which describes the gameplay. The word \"mancala:\u0645\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0629\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; word \"naqala:\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0629\" meaning literally \"to move\". The earliest evidence of &lt;a href=\"Mancala\"&gt;Mancala&lt;/a&gt; consists of fragments of pottery boards and several rock cuts found in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Aksum\"&gt;Aksumite&lt;/a&gt; in Ethiopia, &lt;a href=\"Matara%2C%20Eritrea\"&gt;Matara&lt;/a&gt; (now in &lt;a href=\"Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Yeha\"&gt;Yeha&lt;/a&gt; (also in Ethiopia), which have been dated by archaeologists to between the 6th and 7th century CE. More than 800 names of traditional mancala games are known, and almost 200 invented games have been described. However, some names denote the same game, while some names are used for more than one game. Today, the game is played worldwide, with &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mancala%20games\"&gt;many distinct variants&lt;/a&gt; representing different regions of the world. Some historians believe that mancala is the oldest game in the world based on the archaeological evidence found in &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; that dates around 6000 BCE. The game might have been played by ancient &lt;a href=\"Nabataeans\"&gt;Nabataeans&lt;/a&gt; and could have been an ancient version of the modern mancala game.\nAmericas.\nArchaeologist Barbara Voorhies has theorized that a series of holes on clay floors arranged in c shapes at the Tlacuachero archaeological site in Mexico's Chiapas state may be 5000-year-old dice-game scoreboards. If so this would be the oldest archaeological evidence for a game in the Americas.\n&lt;a href=\"Dice%20games\"&gt;Dice games&lt;/a&gt; were popular throughout the Americas. &lt;a href=\"Patolli\"&gt;Patolli&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most popular board games played by &lt;a href=\"mesoamerican\"&gt;mesoamerican&lt;/a&gt; peoples such as the &lt;a href=\"Mayans\"&gt;Mayans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toltecs\"&gt;Toltecs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aztecs\"&gt;Aztecs&lt;/a&gt;, it was a &lt;a href=\"race%20game\"&gt;race game&lt;/a&gt; played with beans or dice on square and oval-shaped boards and gambling was a key aspect of it. The Andean peoples also played a dice game which is called by the &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20languages\"&gt;Quechua&lt;/a&gt; word or .\nOne of the oldest known ball games in history is the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20ballgame\"&gt;Mesoamerican ballgame&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u014cllamaliztli\" in &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt;). \"\u014cllamaliztli\" was played as far back as 1,400 BC and had important religious significance for the &lt;a href=\"mesoamerican\"&gt;mesoamerican&lt;/a&gt; peoples such as the &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aztec\"&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt;. The game evolved over time but the main goal was to keep a solid rubber ball in play by striking it with various parts of the body or with tools such as rackets. The game may have served as a proxy for warfare and also had a major religious function. Formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring &lt;a href=\"human%20sacrifice\"&gt;human sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, though it was also played for leisure by children and even women.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;indigenous North American peoples&lt;/a&gt; played various kinds of &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20North%20American%20stickball\"&gt;stickball games&lt;/a&gt;, which are the ancestors of modern &lt;a href=\"lacrosse\"&gt;lacrosse&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional stickball games were sometimes major events that could last several days. As many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes would participate. The games were played in open plains located between villages, and the goals could range from to apart.\nEurope.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tafl%20games\"&gt;Tafl games&lt;/a&gt; were a family of ancient &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20tribes\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; board games played across much of Northern Europe from earlier than 400 CE until the 12th century. Although the rules of the games were never explicitly recorded, it seems to have been a game with uneven forces (2:1 ratio) and the goal of one side was to escape to the side of the board with a King while the other side's goal was to capture him. Tafl was spread by the &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt; throughout northern Europe, including &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lapland%20%28region%29\"&gt;Lapland&lt;/a&gt;.\nChess was introduced to the Iberian &lt;a href=\"emirate%20of%20Cordoba\"&gt;emirate of Cordoba&lt;/a&gt; in 822 during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Abd%20ar-Rahman%20II\"&gt;Abd ar-Rahman II&lt;/a&gt;. By the middle of the 10th century it was being played in Christian Spain, Italy and Southern Germany. By 1200, it had reached Britain and Scandinavia. Initially there were many differing local Chess games with varying rules or \"assizes\" such as &lt;a href=\"Short%20assize\"&gt;Short assize&lt;/a&gt; chess, &lt;a href=\"Courier%20chess\"&gt;Courier chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dice%20Chess\"&gt;Dice Chess&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn important source of medieval games is the &lt;a href=\"Libro%20de%20los%20juegos\"&gt;Libro de los juegos&lt;/a&gt;, (\"Book of games\"), or \"Libro de acedrex, dados e tablas\", (\"Book of chess, dice and tables\", in Old Spanish) which was commissioned by &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20X\"&gt;Alfonso X&lt;/a&gt; of Castile, Galicia and Le\u00f3n in 1283. The manuscript contains descriptions and color illustrations of &lt;a href=\"Dice%20games\"&gt;Dice games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chess\"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tabula%20%28game%29\"&gt;tabula&lt;/a&gt;, a predecessor of &lt;a href=\"Backgammon\"&gt;Backgammon&lt;/a&gt;. The book portrays these games within an astrological context, and some game variants are astronomically designed, such as a game titled \"&lt;a href=\"astronomical%20chess\"&gt;astronomical chess&lt;/a&gt;\", played on a board of seven concentric circles, divided radially into twelve areas, each associated with a constellation of the &lt;a href=\"Zodiac\"&gt;Zodiac&lt;/a&gt;. The symbolism of the text indicates that some of these games were given metaphysical significance. Chess was also used to teach social and moral lessons by the Dominican friar &lt;a href=\"Jacobus%20de%20Cessolis\"&gt;Jacobus de Cessolis&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium super ludo scacchorum\" ('Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess'). Published circa 1300, the book was immensely popular.\nOther pre-modern European board games include &lt;a href=\"Rithmomachy\"&gt;Rithmomachy&lt;/a&gt; or \"the philosophers game\", &lt;a href=\"Alquerque\"&gt;Alquerque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20%26amp%3B%20Geese\"&gt;Fox &amp; Geese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nine%20men%27s%20morris\"&gt;Nine men's morris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draughts\"&gt;Draughts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nim\"&gt;Nim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catch%20the%20Hare\"&gt;Catch the Hare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Game%20of%20the%20Goose\"&gt;Game of the Goose&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dice%20games\"&gt;Dice games&lt;/a&gt; were widely played throughout Europe and included &lt;a href=\"Hazard%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hazard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuck-a-luck\"&gt;Chuck-a-luck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%BCckshaus\"&gt;Gl\u00fcckshaus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shut%20the%20Box\"&gt;Shut the Box&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"knucklebones\"&gt;knucklebones&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Card%20games\"&gt;Card games&lt;/a&gt; first arrived in Italy from &lt;a href=\"Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29\"&gt;Mamluk Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in the 14th century, with suits very similar to the Swords, Clubs, Cups and Coins and those still used in traditional &lt;a href=\"Italian%20playing%20cards\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20playing%20cards\"&gt;Spanish decks&lt;/a&gt;. The four &lt;a href=\"suit%20%28cards%29\"&gt;suits&lt;/a&gt; most commonly encountered today (spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs) appear to have originated in France circa 1480. 1440s Italy saw the rise of &lt;a href=\"tarot%20cards\"&gt;tarot cards&lt;/a&gt; and this led to the development of &lt;a href=\"Tarot%20card%20games\"&gt;Tarot card games&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Tarocchini\"&gt;Tarocchini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6nigrufen\"&gt;K\u00f6nigrufen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20tarot\"&gt;French tarot&lt;/a&gt;. The decks were also sometimes used for &lt;a href=\"cartomancy\"&gt;cartomancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutdoor games were very popular during holidays and fairs and were played by all classes. Many of these games are the predecessors of modern sports and &lt;a href=\"lawn%20game\"&gt;lawn game&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Boules\"&gt;Boules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trucco\"&gt;Lawn Billiards&lt;/a&gt; (later brought indoors as &lt;a href=\"Billiards\"&gt;Billiards&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Skittles%20%28sport%29\"&gt;Skittles&lt;/a&gt; (an ancestor of modern ten pin &lt;a href=\"Bowling\"&gt;Bowling&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"medieval%20football\"&gt;medieval football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kolven\"&gt;Kolven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoolball\"&gt;Stoolball&lt;/a&gt; (an ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Cricket\"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Jeu%20de%20paume\"&gt;Jeu de paume&lt;/a&gt; (early racket-less &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Horseshoes\"&gt;Horseshoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quoits\"&gt;Quoits&lt;/a&gt; all predate the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern\"&gt;early modern&lt;/a&gt; era.\nModern games.\nProfessional board games.\n&lt;a href=\"Rules%20of%20chess\"&gt;Modern chess rules&lt;/a&gt; began taking shape in Spain and Italy during the 15th century with the adoption of the standard Queen and Bishop movements (initially called \"Mad Queen chess\"). Writings on &lt;a href=\"chess%20theory\"&gt;chess theory&lt;/a&gt; also began to appear in the 15th century with the first text being the \"Repetici\u00f3n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez\" (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess, 1497) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena. Chess books by authors such as &lt;a href=\"Ruy%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Segura\"&gt;Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gioachino%20Greco\"&gt;Gioachino Greco&lt;/a&gt; became widely studied. Chess was the favored game of &lt;a href=\"Voltaire\"&gt;Voltaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rousseau\"&gt;Rousseau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1851, the &lt;a href=\"London%201851%20chess%20tournament\"&gt;first international chess tournament was held in London&lt;/a&gt; and won by &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Anderssen\"&gt;Adolf Anderssen&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after modern &lt;a href=\"time%20control\"&gt;time control&lt;/a&gt; rules were adopted for competitive play. The first &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship%201886\"&gt;Official World Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; was held in 1886 in the United States and won by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Steinitz\"&gt;Wilhelm Steinitz&lt;/a&gt;. By the 20th century, the game of &lt;a href=\"Chess\"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; had developed into a &lt;a href=\"professional%20sport\"&gt;professional sport&lt;/a&gt; with chess clubs, publications, &lt;a href=\"Chess%20rating%20system\"&gt;player ratings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chess%20tournaments\"&gt;chess tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Federation\"&gt;World Chess Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FIDE) was founded in 1924 in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large number of &lt;a href=\"Chess%20variants\"&gt;Chess variants&lt;/a&gt; were also developed, with varying &lt;a href=\"fairy%20chess%20pieces\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt;, rules, boards and scoring. Among them are &lt;a href=\"Kriegspiel%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Kriegspiel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capablanca%20Chess\"&gt;Capablanca Chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Chess\"&gt;Alice Chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Circular%20chess\"&gt;Circular chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Three-dimensional%20chess\"&gt;Three-dimensional chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hexagonal%20Chess\"&gt;Hexagonal Chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chess%20with%20different%20armies\"&gt;Chess with different armies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Fischer\"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chess960\"&gt;Chess960&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Go%20%28game%29\"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shogi\"&gt;Shogi&lt;/a&gt; became the major board games played at a professional level. Both games were promoted in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20shogunate\"&gt;Tokugawa shogunate&lt;/a&gt; in the 17th century, and top players (&lt;a href=\"Meijin\"&gt;Meijin&lt;/a&gt;) received government endowments. During the 20th century the Japan Shogi Association and the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Go%20Association\"&gt;Japan Go Association&lt;/a&gt; were founded and began organizing professional tournaments. During the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Xiangqi\"&gt;Xiangqi&lt;/a&gt; clubs were formed and books published. The &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Xiangqi%20Association\"&gt;Chinese Xiangqi Association&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 1962, and Xiangqi tournaments are held worldwide by national Xiangqi associations.\nIn 1997 the first &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Sports%20Olympiad\"&gt;Mind Sports Olympiad&lt;/a&gt; was held in London and included traditional as well as modern board games. Other board games such as &lt;a href=\"Backgammon\"&gt;Backgammon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scrabble\"&gt;Scrabble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Risk%20%28game%29\"&gt;Risk&lt;/a&gt; are also played professionally with dedicated world championships.\nCommercial board games.\nThe Ancient Indian game of &lt;a href=\"Pachisi\"&gt;Pachisi&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the west by the British in the 1863 and an adaptation of the oldest game named &lt;a href=\"Parcheesi\"&gt;Parcheesi&lt;/a&gt; was first copyrighted in the United States by EG Selchow &amp; Co in 1869. A version of the game called &lt;a href=\"Ludo%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Ludo&lt;/a&gt; was patented in 1896. A similar German race game, &lt;a href=\"Mensch%20%C3%A4rgere%20dich%20nicht\"&gt;Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht&lt;/a&gt; (\"Man, don't get annoyed\"), became immensely popular with German troops during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Another Indian game which was adopted by the West was &lt;a href=\"Gyan%20chauper\"&gt;Gyan chauper&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Moksha Patam), popularly known as &lt;a href=\"snakes%20and%20ladders\"&gt;snakes and ladders&lt;/a&gt;. This was a game which was intended to teach lessons about &lt;a href=\"karma\"&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt; and good and bad actions, the ladders represented virtues and the snakes vices. The moral lesson of the game was that spiritual liberation, or &lt;a href=\"Moksha\"&gt;Moksha&lt;/a&gt; could only be achieved through virtuous action, while vice led to endless reincarnation. The game dates to medieval India where it was played by Jains and Hindus. A Buddhist version, known as \"ascending the [spiritual] levels\" (Tibetan: ) is played in Nepal and Tibet while a Muslim version of the game played during the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;mughal period&lt;/a&gt; from the late 17th or early 18th centuries featured the 101 names of God. The game was first brought to Victorian England and it was published in the United States as \"Chutes and Ladders\" (an \"improved new version of England's famous indoor sport\") by game pioneer &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Bradley\"&gt;Milton Bradley&lt;/a&gt; in 1943.\nThe first board game for which the name of its designer is known is 'A Journey Through Europe or the Play of Geography', a map-based game published in 1759 by &lt;a href=\"John%20Jefferys\"&gt;John Jefferys&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt; and writing teacher. Designed in England by George Fox in 1800, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mansion%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;The Mansion of Happiness&lt;/a&gt; became the prototype for commercial board games for at least two centuries to follow. The first board game published in the United States was 'Traveller's Tour Through the United States', published by New York City bookseller F. Lockwood in 1822. The earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality and included The Mansion of Happiness (1843) and The Game of Pope or Pagan, or The Siege of the Stronghold of Satan by the Christian Army (1844). While demonstrating the commercial viability of the ancient race game format, its moralistic overtones were countered by &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Bradley\"&gt;Milton Bradley&lt;/a&gt; in 1860 with the introduction of a radically different concept of success in &lt;a href=\"The%20Checkered%20Game%20of%20Life\"&gt;The Checkered Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;, in which material successes came as a result of accomplishments such as attending college, marrying, and getting rich. Likewise the &lt;a href=\"Game%20of%20the%20District%20Messenger%20Boy\"&gt;Game of the District Messenger Boy&lt;/a&gt; (1886) also focused on secular capitalist virtues rather than the religious. \nFirst patented in 1904, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Landlord%27s%20Game\"&gt;The Landlord's Game&lt;/a&gt;\", designed by &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Magie\"&gt;Elizabeth Magie&lt;/a&gt;, was originally intended to illustrate the economic consequences of &lt;a href=\"law%20of%20rent\"&gt;Ricardo's Law&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Economic%20rent\"&gt;Economic rent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Georgism\"&gt;Georgist&lt;/a&gt; concept of a &lt;a href=\"land%20value%20tax\"&gt;single tax on land value&lt;/a&gt;. A series of &lt;a href=\"board%20game\"&gt;board game&lt;/a&gt;s were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of modern &lt;a href=\"Monopoly%20%28game%29\"&gt;Monopoly&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Parker%20Brothers\"&gt;Parker Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the first commercial version of the &lt;a href=\"Battleship%20%28game%29\"&gt;game of Battleship&lt;/a&gt; was \"Salvo\", published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company, the game itself dates to before &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; when it was played on paper by Russian officers. The French board game \"L'Attaque\" was first commercially released in 1910, having been designed two years prior as a military-themed imperfect knowledge game based upon the earlier Chinese children's board game &lt;a href=\"Dou%20Shou%20Qi\"&gt;Dou Shou Qi&lt;/a&gt;. \"L'Attaque\" was subsequently adapted by the Chinese into &lt;a href=\"Luzhanqi\"&gt;Luzhanqi&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Lu Zhan Jun Qi\"), and by &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Bradley\"&gt;Milton Bradley&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Stratego\"&gt;Stratego&lt;/a&gt;, the latter having been trademarked in 1960 while the former remains in the public domain. &lt;a href=\"Jury%20Box%20%28game%29\"&gt;Jury Box&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1935, was the first murder mystery game which served as the basis for games like &lt;a href=\"Cluedo\"&gt;Cluedo&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially designed in 1938, &lt;a href=\"Scrabble\"&gt;Scrabble&lt;/a&gt; received its first mass-market exposure in 1952, two years prior to the release of &lt;a href=\"Diplomacy%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;, in 1954. &lt;a href=\"Diplomacy%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; was a game favored by &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Kissinger\"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;. Originally released in 1957 as \"La Conqu\u00eate du Monde\" (\"The Conquest of the World\") in France, &lt;a href=\"Risk%20%28game%29\"&gt;Risk&lt;/a&gt; was first published under its English title in 1959.\nStarting with &lt;a href=\"Gettysburg%20%28game%29\"&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1958, the company &lt;a href=\"Avalon%20Hill\"&gt;Avalon Hill&lt;/a&gt; developed particular board wargames covering specific historical themes such as &lt;a href=\"Midway%20%281964%20game%29\"&gt;Midway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D-Day%20%28game%29\"&gt;D-Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PanzerBlitz\"&gt;PanzerBlitz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Board%20wargame\"&gt;Board wargame&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Squad%20Leader\"&gt;Squad Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20%28game%29\"&gt;Tactics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Europa%20%28wargame%29\"&gt;Europa&lt;/a&gt; developed extremely complex and realistic rules. Avalon Hill's &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20%281980%20board%20game%29\"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt; introduced the use of the technology tree (or \"tech tree\"), variants of which have been implemented in numerous later board and &lt;a href=\"video%20games\"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Sid Meier's Civilization&lt;/a&gt;. Recent &lt;a href=\"wargaming\"&gt;wargames&lt;/a&gt; such as 'A distant plain', 'Labyrinth' and the satirical &lt;a href=\"War%20on%20Terror%20%28game%29\"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt; have focused on counterinsurgency and contemporary &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;.\nA concentrated design movement towards the &lt;a href=\"German-style%20board%20game\"&gt;German-style board game&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Eurogame\", began in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Germany, and led to the development of board games such as &lt;a href=\"Carcassonne%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Carcassone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Settlers%20of%20Catan\"&gt;The Settlers of Catan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agricola%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Agricola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ticket%20to%20Ride%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Ticket to ride&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.\nCard games.\nDuring the 15th century &lt;a href=\"Suit%20%28cards%29\"&gt;card suits&lt;/a&gt; began to approach the contemporary regional styles and the court cards evolved to represent European royalty. Early European card games included &lt;a href=\"Noddy%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Noddy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triomphe\"&gt;Triomphe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"All%20Fours\"&gt;All Fours&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piquet\"&gt;Piquet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basset%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Basset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hofamterspiel\"&gt;Hofamterspiel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karn%C3%B6ffel\"&gt;Karn\u00f6ffel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Primero\"&gt;Primero&lt;/a&gt;. In 1674 &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Cotton\"&gt;Charles Cotton&lt;/a&gt; published his \"&lt;a href=\"Compleat%20Gamester\"&gt;Compleat Gamester&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the first books which set out to outline rules for many card and dice games. During the mid 16th century, Portuguese traders introduced playing cards to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The first reference to \"twenty-one\", the precursor of &lt;a href=\"Blackjack\"&gt;Blackjack&lt;/a&gt; is found in a book by the Spanish author &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20de%20Cervantes\"&gt;Miguel de Cervantes&lt;/a&gt;. Cervantes was a &lt;a href=\"gambler\"&gt;gambler&lt;/a&gt;, and the main characters of his tale \"&lt;a href=\"Rinconete%20y%20Cortadillo\"&gt;Rinconete y Cortadillo&lt;/a&gt;\" are cheats proficient at playing \"ventiuna\" (twenty-one).\nThe game of &lt;a href=\"Cribbage\"&gt;Cribbage&lt;/a&gt; appears to have developed in the early 17th century, as an adaptation of the earlier card game &lt;a href=\"Noddy%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Noddy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pinochle\"&gt;Pinochle&lt;/a&gt; was likely derived from the earlier &lt;a href=\"Bezique\"&gt;Bezique&lt;/a&gt;, a game popular in France during the 17th century. 1742 saw the publication of &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Hoyle\"&gt;Edmund Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Short Treatise on the Game of &lt;a href=\"Whist\"&gt;Whist&lt;/a&gt;' which became one of the bestselling publications of the 18th century. &lt;a href=\"Whist\"&gt;Whist&lt;/a&gt; was widely played during the 18th and 19th centuries, having evolved from the 16th century game of \"Trump\" (or \"Ruff\") by way of &lt;a href=\"Ruff%20and%20Honours\"&gt;Ruff and Honours&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Baccarat&lt;/a&gt; first came to the attention of the public at large and grew to be widely played as a direct result of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Baccarat%20Scandal\"&gt;Royal Baccarat Scandal&lt;/a&gt; of 1891, and bears resemblances to the card games &lt;a href=\"Faro%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Faro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basset%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Basset&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were very popular during the 19th century. The rules of &lt;a href=\"Contract%20bridge\"&gt;Contract bridge&lt;/a&gt; were originally published in 1925, the game having been derived from Bridge games with rules published as early as 1886, Bridge games, in turn, having evolved from the earlier game of Whist.\nThe first documented game of &lt;a href=\"poker\"&gt;poker&lt;/a&gt; dates from an 1833 Mississippi river steamer. During the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; the game was popular with soldiers and additions were made including &lt;a href=\"stud%20poker\"&gt;stud poker&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Straight%20%28poker%29\"&gt;straight&lt;/a&gt;. Modern &lt;a href=\"Poker%20tournament\"&gt;tournament&lt;/a&gt; play became popular in &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; casinos after the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series%20of%20Poker\"&gt;World Series of Poker&lt;/a&gt; (WSOP) began, in 1970. Poker's popularity experienced &lt;a href=\"poker%20boom\"&gt;an unprecedented spike&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the 21st century, largely because of the introduction of &lt;a href=\"online%20poker\"&gt;online poker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hole-card%20camera\"&gt;hole-card camera&lt;/a&gt;s, which turned the game into a &lt;a href=\"spectator%20sport\"&gt;spectator sport&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009 the &lt;a href=\"International%20Federation%20of%20Poker\"&gt;International Federation of Poker&lt;/a&gt; was founded in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Lausanne, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the official governing body for poker.\n&lt;a href=\"Collectible%20card%20game\"&gt;Collectible card game&lt;/a&gt;s or trading card games while bearing similarities to earlier games in concept, first achieved wide popularity in the 1990s. The first trading card game was 'The Base Ball Card Game' produced by The Allegheny Card Co. and registered on 4 April 1904. It featured 104 unique baseball cards with individual player attributes printed on the cards enabling each collector to build a team and play the game against another person. The 1990s saw the rise of games such as and the &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiniature wargaming.\n&lt;a href=\"Miniature%20figure%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;Miniature figure&lt;/a&gt; games have their origin in a German chess variant called 'The King's Game', created in 1780 by Helwig, Master of Pages to the Duke of Brunswick. It had a board with 1,666 squares of varying types of terrain, with pieces representing modern military units. In the early 19th century, the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20army\"&gt;Prussian army&lt;/a&gt; developed war games or 'kriegspieler', with staff officers moving pieces around on a game table, using dice rolls to indicate chance or \"friction\" and with an umpire scoring the results. After the stunning Prussian &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20War\"&gt;victories against Austria&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;and France&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century, the &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;ns, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;ns all began to make use of wargaming as a training tool. By 1889 wargaming was firmly embedded in the culture of the U.S. Navy.\nThe first non-military wargame rules were developed by Naval enthusiast and analyst &lt;a href=\"Fred%20T.%20Jane\"&gt;Fred T. Jane&lt;/a&gt; in 1898. &lt;a href=\"H.%20G.%20Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt; published rules in his \"&lt;a href=\"Floor%20Games\"&gt;Floor Games&lt;/a&gt;\" (1911) and \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Wars\"&gt;Little Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" (1913) designed for wargaming with toy soldiers. In 1956, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Scruby\"&gt;Jack Scruby&lt;/a&gt;, known as the \"Father of Modern Miniature Wargaming\" organized the first miniatures convention and he was also a manufacturer of military miniatures and editor of a wargaming newsletter. Miniature war games became affordable and mainstream in the late 1950s with the rise of cheaper miniature production methods by miniature figure manufacturers such as Scruby Miniatures, Miniature Figurines and Hinchliffe. During the 1980s there was a boom in miniature wargaming with the development of games such as &lt;a href=\"Warhammer%20Fantasy%20Battle\"&gt;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warhammer%2040%2C000\"&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/a&gt;. Today miniature wargaming includes most historical eras, fantasy and science fiction settings as well as &lt;a href=\"Naval%20wargaming\"&gt;Naval wargaming&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Give%20Up%20the%20Ship%21\"&gt;Don't Give Up the Ship!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Quarters%20%28rules%29\"&gt;General Quarters&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Air%20wargaming\"&gt;Air wargaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Space%20combat\"&gt;Space combat&lt;/a&gt; wargames (&lt;a href=\"Full%20Thrust\"&gt;Full Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, ).\nRole playing games.\nEarly role-playing games such as those made by &lt;a href=\"M.%20A.%20R.%20Barker\"&gt;M. A. R. Barker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Stafford\"&gt;Greg Stafford&lt;/a&gt; developed from miniature figure wargames. &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Gygax\"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Minnesota\"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;'s wargaming society developed a set of rules for a late &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; milieu. This game was called &lt;a href=\"Chainmail%20%28game%29\"&gt;Chainmail&lt;/a&gt; and was a historical game, but later editions included an appendix for adding fantasy elements such as spells, wizards and dragons. By 1971, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Arneson\"&gt;Dave Arneson&lt;/a&gt; had developed a miniatures game called \"&lt;a href=\"Blackmoor%20%28campaign%20setting%29\"&gt;Blackmoor&lt;/a&gt;\" which contained elements that would become widespread in fantasy gaming: &lt;a href=\"hit%20point\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"experience%20point\"&gt;experience point&lt;/a&gt;s, character levels, &lt;a href=\"armor%20class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20crawl\"&gt;dungeon crawl&lt;/a&gt;s. Arneson and Gygax then met and collaborated on the first \"&lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" game which was released in 1974 by Gygax's &lt;a href=\"TSR%20%28company%29\"&gt;TSR&lt;/a&gt;. The game was very successful and several other games such as the Science fiction RPG &lt;a href=\"Traveller%20%28role-playing%20game%29\"&gt;Traveller&lt;/a&gt; and the generic &lt;a href=\"GURPS\"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt; system followed in imitation. In the late 1970s TSR launched Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D) which saw an expansion of rulebooks and additions. The 80s saw several &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20controversies\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies&lt;/a&gt; such as the claims that the game promoted &lt;a href=\"Satanism\"&gt;Satanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional Roleplaying games were the basis for the modern &lt;a href=\"Role-playing%20video%20game\"&gt;Role-playing video game&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther indoor games.\nIn &lt;a href=\"colonial%20America\"&gt;colonial America&lt;/a&gt;, the game of &lt;a href=\"Hazard\"&gt;Hazard&lt;/a&gt; was called \"crapaud\" by the French in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; (a French word meaning \"toad\" in reference to the original style of play by people crouched over a floor or sidewalk). This was later shortened to &lt;a href=\"craps\"&gt;craps&lt;/a&gt; and after several adaptations became the most popular gambling dice game in the United States. &lt;a href=\"Sic%20bo\"&gt;Sic bo&lt;/a&gt; was introduced into the United States by Chinese immigrants in the 20th century and is now a popular &lt;a href=\"casino%20game\"&gt;casino game&lt;/a&gt;. Another casino game, &lt;a href=\"Roulette\"&gt;Roulette&lt;/a&gt;, has been played since the late 18th century, and was probably adapted from English wheel games such as Roly-Poly and E.O.\nWith the possible exception of &lt;a href=\"Carrom\"&gt;Carrom&lt;/a&gt; (a game whose origins are uncertain), the earliest &lt;a href=\"table%20games\"&gt;table games&lt;/a&gt; appear to have been the &lt;a href=\"Cue%20sports\"&gt;Cue sports&lt;/a&gt;, which include &lt;a href=\"Carom%20billiards\"&gt;Carom billiards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pool%20%28cue%20sports%29\"&gt;Pool&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Pocket billiards\", and &lt;a href=\"Snooker\"&gt;Snooker&lt;/a&gt;. The cue sports are generally regarded as having developed into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball &lt;a href=\"lawn%20game\"&gt;lawn game&lt;/a&gt;s (retroactively termed &lt;a href=\"ground%20billiards\"&gt;ground billiards&lt;/a&gt;), and as such to be related to &lt;a href=\"trucco\"&gt;trucco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"croquet\"&gt;croquet&lt;/a&gt; and golf, and more distantly to the stickless &lt;a href=\"bocce\"&gt;bocce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Dominoes\"&gt;Dominoes&lt;/a&gt;, which originate in China and date as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Song%20Dynasty\"&gt;Song Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (AD 1120), first appeared in Europe during the 18th century. The Chinese &lt;a href=\"tile%20based%20games\"&gt;tile game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mahjong\"&gt;Mahjong&lt;/a&gt; developed from a Chinese card game known as M\u01cedi\u00e0o sometime during the 17th century and was imported into the United States in the 1920s.\nOutdoor games.\nModern &lt;a href=\"sports\"&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt; developed from different European games, many of them played by European royalty. &lt;a href=\"Tennis\"&gt;Tennis&lt;/a&gt; developed in France, French kings like &lt;a href=\"Francis%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Francis I of France&lt;/a&gt; (1515\u201347) and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; (1547\u201359) were well known players. &lt;a href=\"Golf\"&gt;Golf&lt;/a&gt; originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457. The ban was lifted by James IV in 1502 who also played golf. &lt;a href=\"Cricket\"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; can be traced back to Tudor times in early 16th-century England and the modern rules of &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby football&lt;/a&gt; are based on mid-19th century rules made to standardise the football games played by &lt;a href=\"English%20public%20schools\"&gt;English public schools&lt;/a&gt;. These team sports were spread worldwide by the influence of the &lt;a href=\"British%20empire\"&gt;British empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nElectronic games.\nThe earliest reference to a purely electronic game appears to be a United States patent registration in 1947 for what was described by its inventors as a \"&lt;a href=\"cathode%20ray%20tube%20amusement%20device\"&gt;cathode ray tube amusement device&lt;/a&gt;\". Through the 1950s and 1960s the majority of early computer games ran on university &lt;a href=\"mainframe%20computer\"&gt;mainframe computer&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1971, video &lt;a href=\"arcade%20game\"&gt;arcade game&lt;/a&gt;s began to be offered to the public for play. The first &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20console\"&gt;home video game console&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magnavox%20Odyssey\"&gt;Magnavox Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, was released in 1972.\nThe &lt;a href=\"golden%20age%20of%20arcade%20video%20games\"&gt;golden age of arcade video games&lt;/a&gt; began in 1978 and continued through to the mid-1980s. A &lt;a href=\"second%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles\"&gt;second generation of video game consoles&lt;/a&gt;, released between 1977 and 1983, saw increased popularity as a result of this, though this eventually came to an abrupt end with the &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20crash%20of%201983\"&gt;video game crash of 1983&lt;/a&gt;. The home &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20industry\"&gt;video game industry&lt;/a&gt; was eventually revitalized with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles\"&gt;third generation of game consoles&lt;/a&gt; over the next few years, which saw a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the United States to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. This same time period saw the advent of the &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer%20game\"&gt;personal computer game&lt;/a&gt;, specialized gaming &lt;a href=\"home%20computer\"&gt;home computer&lt;/a&gt;s, early &lt;a href=\"online%20game\"&gt;online gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and the introduction of &lt;a href=\"LED\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"handheld%20electronic%20game\"&gt;handheld electronic game&lt;/a&gt;s and eventually &lt;a href=\"handheld%20video%20game\"&gt;handheld video game&lt;/a&gt;s."
