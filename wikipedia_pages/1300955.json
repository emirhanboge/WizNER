Matveyev started his career as a government official, who worked in &lt;a href=\"Zaporozhian%20Host\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and took part in some of Russia's wars with &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the Russian &lt;a href=\"delegation\"&gt;delegation&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Pereyaslav\"&gt;Treaty of Pereyaslav&lt;/a&gt; in 1654 and Russian &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20mission\"&gt;diplomatic mission&lt;/a&gt; to Poland in 1656-1657. As the head of the &lt;a href=\"Streltsy%20Department\"&gt;Streltsy Department&lt;/a&gt;, Matveyev participated in suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Riot\"&gt;Copper Riot&lt;/a&gt; in 1662. Seven years later, he was put in charge of the \"&lt;a href=\"Malorossiysky%20Prikaz\"&gt;Malorossiysky Prikaz&lt;/a&gt;\", i.e. Ministry of the Ukrainian Affairs, and in 1671 - head of the \"&lt;a href=\"Posolsky%20Prikaz\"&gt;Posolsky Prikaz&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"foreign%20ministry\"&gt;foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt;) and other ministries. Matveyev was known to have considered unification of Ukraine and Russia as the most important issue of the Russian &lt;a href=\"foreign%20policy\"&gt;foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;. He once said that it was even possible to temporarily forget about the struggle with the &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedes&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of unification with Ukraine. In 1672, Matveyev managed to secure &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt; for Russia during the talks with Poland.\nAfter Matveev had become head of the Little Russian Chancellery in 1669 and after the death of the tsar's first consort &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Miloslavskaya\"&gt;Maria Miloslavskaya&lt;/a&gt;, tsar Alexis visited the house of Matveev to meet prospective brides. Here Alexis also met &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Naryshkina\"&gt;Natalia Naryshkina&lt;/a&gt;, whom he married on 22 January 1671. Matveev had 'sponsored' several young ladies at his house, including Natalia. She was put forward due to her family connections as her brothers were subordinant officers in Matveev's musketeer regiments. At the end of the year Matveyev was raised to the rank of \"&lt;a href=\"okolnichy\"&gt;okolnichy&lt;/a&gt;\", and on 1 September 1674 attained the still higher dignity of &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt;. The deplorable physical condition of Alexius's immediate successor, &lt;a href=\"Feodor%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Feodor III&lt;/a&gt;, suggested to Matveyev the desirability of elevating to the throne the sturdy little &lt;a href=\"tsarevich\"&gt;tsarevich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peter%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, then in his fourth year. He purchased the allegiance of the \"&lt;a href=\"Streltsy\"&gt;Streltsy&lt;/a&gt;\" and then, summoning the boyars of the council, earnestly represented to them that Feodor was unable to reign and urged the substitution of little Peter. But the &lt;a href=\"reactionary\"&gt;reactionary&lt;/a&gt; boyars, among whom were the near kinsmen of Feodor, proclaimed him tsar and Matveyev was &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;ed to &lt;a href=\"Pustozyorsk\"&gt;Pustozyorsk&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained till Feodor's death on 7 May 1682. Immediately afterwards Peter was proclaimed tsar by &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Joachim%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch Joachim&lt;/a&gt;, and the first \"&lt;a href=\"ukaz\"&gt;ukaz&lt;/a&gt;\" issued in Peter's name summoned Matveyev to return to the capital and act as chief adviser to the &lt;a href=\"tsaritsa\"&gt;tsaritsa&lt;/a&gt; Natalia. Matveyev came to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; on 11 May, and four days later had to meet with the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Uprising%20of%201682\"&gt;rebellious \"Streltsy\"&lt;/a&gt;, who had been instigated to rebel by the anti-Petrine faction. He had already succeeded in partially pacifying them, when one of their &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;s began to abuse the still hesitating and suspicious musketeers. Infuriated, they seized Matveyev and hacked him to pieces.\nMatveyev was a very educated and versatile individual for his time. He organized a &lt;a href=\"publishing%20house\"&gt;publishing house&lt;/a&gt; on the premises of the \"Posolsky Prikaz\" and compiled the so-called \"Book of Titles\" (), an illustrated reference book about &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;s of the Russian tsar and foreign rulers, with some information on Russian history, pictures of different &lt;a href=\"coats%20of%20arms\"&gt;coats of arms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20%28emblem%29\"&gt;stamp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monarch\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"patriarch\"&gt;patriarch&lt;/a&gt;s. Matveyev was also a collector of rare books and had a huge &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;. He decorated his house with pieces of fine art, &lt;a href=\"optical\"&gt;optical&lt;/a&gt; devices and models of different ships. Matveyev was the one to introduce &lt;a href=\"theater\"&gt;theater&lt;/a&gt; to the court by organizing a group of actors who staged various plays. He was also one of the organizers of the &lt;a href=\"State%20Historical%20Museum\"&gt;first apothecary in Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. His son &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Matveev\"&gt;Andrey Matveev&lt;/a&gt; was made a count and served as the first President of &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Collegium\"&gt;Justice Collegium&lt;/a&gt;."
