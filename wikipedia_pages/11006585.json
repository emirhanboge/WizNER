    "text": " \nThe Kupriyanov Islands are a group of islands off the south coast of &lt;a href=\"South%20Georgia%20Island\"&gt;South Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, close south of &lt;a href=\"Diaz%20Cove\"&gt;Diaz Cove&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe name \"Mys Kupriyanov\" or \"Mys Kupriyanova\", for &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Kupriyanov\"&gt;Ivan Kupriyanov&lt;/a&gt;, an officer of the \"&lt;a href=\"Mirny%20%28sloop-of-war%29\"&gt;Mirnyy&lt;/a&gt;\", was given by Admiral &lt;a href=\"Fabian%20Gottlieb%20von%20Bellingshausen\"&gt;Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen&lt;/a&gt; in 1819 to a cape on the coast between &lt;a href=\"Novosilski%20Bay\"&gt;Novosilski Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Disappointment%20%28South%20Georgia%29\"&gt;Cape Disappointment&lt;/a&gt;. The name was evidently overlooked by Lieutenant Commander &lt;a href=\"J.M.%20Chaplin\"&gt;J.M. Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;, who in 1930 gave the name \"Johannesen Point\" to a feature on this same stretch of coast. Johannesen Point was identified by the &lt;a href=\"South%20Georgia%20Survey\"&gt;South Georgia Survey&lt;/a&gt;, 1955\u201356, as an insignificant point not requiring a name. At the same time, the group of islands off Diaz Cove was mapped in detail for the first time. An altered form of the original Russian name has been accepted for this group."
