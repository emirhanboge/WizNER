    "text": "Poplin, also called tabinet (or tabbinet), is a fine, but thick, wool, cotton or silk fabric that has a horizontal warp and a vertical weft. Nowadays, it is a strong &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;fabric&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"plain%20weave\"&gt;plain weave&lt;/a&gt; of any fiber or blend, with crosswise ribs that typically gives a corded surface.\nPoplin traditionally consisted of a &lt;a href=\"silk\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warp%20%28weaving%29\"&gt;warp&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"weft\"&gt;weft&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"worsted%20yarn\"&gt;worsted yarn&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, as the weft is in the form of a stout cord, the fabric has a ridged structure, like &lt;a href=\"Rep%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;rep&lt;/a&gt;, which gives depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. The ribs run across the fabric from &lt;a href=\"selvedge\"&gt;selvedge&lt;/a&gt; to selvedge.\nPoplin is now made with &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silk\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rayon\"&gt;rayon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polyester\"&gt;polyester&lt;/a&gt; or a mixture of these. Since it has a plain under/over weave, the fabric displays a plain woven surface with no ribbing if the weft and warp threads are of the same material and size. Shirts made from this material are easy to iron and do not wrinkle easily.\nPoplins are used for dress purposes, and for rich &lt;a href=\"upholstery\"&gt;upholstery&lt;/a&gt; work which are formed by using coarse filling yarns in a plain/hard weave.\nThe term poplin originates from \"papelino\", a fabric made at &lt;a href=\"Avignon\"&gt;Avignon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, in the 15th century, named for the &lt;a href=\"papal\"&gt;papal&lt;/a&gt; (pope's) &lt;a href=\"Avignon%20Papacy\"&gt;residence there&lt;/a&gt;, and from the French \"papelaine\" (a fabric, normally made with silk, of the same period). The most common usage of poplin until about the 20th century was to make silk, cotton or heavy weight wool dresses, suitable for winter wear.\nIn the early 1920s, British-made cotton poplin was introduced to the United States, but the American market thought that the name had connotations of heaviness and arbitrarily renamed it broadcloth, a name that persists for a cotton or polyester-cotton blend fabric used for shirting. In Europe, &lt;a href=\"broadcloth\"&gt;broadcloth&lt;/a&gt; typically describes a densely woven woolen fabric with a smooth finish."
