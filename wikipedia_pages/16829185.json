It hears cases involving: tort, contract, landlord and tenant rights ($0\u201310,000); felony first appearances; misdemeanor, DWI/DUI, domestic violence, and other traffic violations.\nLocal government.\nLocal government in New Mexico consists of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20counties%20in%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20settlements%20in%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;municipalities&lt;/a&gt;. There are thirty-three counties, of which &lt;a href=\"Bernalillo%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Bernalillo County&lt;/a&gt;, containing the state's largest city &lt;a href=\"Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt;, is the most populous. Counties are usually governed by an elected five-member county commission, sheriff, assessor, clerk and treasurer. A municipality may call itself a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, and there is no distinction in law and no correlation to any particular form (Mayor-Council, Commission-Manager, etc.). Municipal elections are non-partisan. In addition, limited local authority can be vested in special districts and landowners' associations."
