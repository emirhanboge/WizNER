    "text": "Heimat (\u201cHome\u201d; 1893) is a play by the German dramatist &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Sudermann\"&gt;Hermann Sudermann&lt;/a&gt;. The play, either in the original &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; or in translations, was commonly also known as Magda, the name of the heroine. It was thought by some to be the most widely known and the most successful drama of the end of the 19th century.\nAnalysis.\nIts success in the 19th century is traceable to at least four causes:\nThe technique is a clever combination of the &lt;a href=\"Naturalism%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;naturalism&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ibsen\"&gt;Ibsen&lt;/a&gt; and the methods of the \"drame \u00e0 th\u00e8se\" familiar in the works of &lt;a href=\"Dumas%20fils\"&gt;Dumas fils&lt;/a&gt;. The conventional \"raisonneur\" \u2014 in the person of the Pastor Heffterdingk \u2014 mediates between Magda and her father, and debates with each the problems presented by the situation of a &lt;a href=\"Spendthrift\"&gt;prodigal&lt;/a&gt; daughter who returns home after a life of moral irregularity but &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic success.\nThe play bids the audience to despise respectability and admire independence. But the representative of each side is far from being an acceptable champion. Magda's father fails to recognize the difference between a child with duties and a human being with rights, and Magda reveals no conception of the fact that duty is only in part a social obligation and is in its innermost essence an obligation of self-respect.\nAdaptation.\nIn 1938 the play was adapted into a film \"&lt;a href=\"Heimat%20%281938%20film%29\"&gt;Heimat&lt;/a&gt;\" directed by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Froelich\"&gt;Carl Froelich&lt;/a&gt;.\nEditions.\nIt has been translated into English by C. E. A. Winslow (Boston 1896), and edited by F. G. G. Schmidt (Boston 1909)."
