    "text": "The Fokker T.III or T.3 was a single engine &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt; designed in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1920s as a &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and development.\nFokker's second &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt; was an enlarged version on the T.II from two years before. With a slightly greater span and 30% heavier, it had a crew of three rather than two and a more powerful engine. Its &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floats&lt;/a&gt; could be exchanged for a wheeled &lt;a href=\"Landing%20gear\"&gt;undercarriage&lt;/a&gt;. It first flew in the summer of 1923.\nThe T.III was a &lt;a href=\"cantilever\"&gt;cantilever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monoplane%23Types\"&gt;low wing monoplane&lt;/a&gt; with thick section, straight tapered, square tipped wings. Angular &lt;a href=\"Aileron%23Horns%20and%20aerodynamic%20counterbalances\"&gt;overhung ailerons&lt;/a&gt; were used. Its &lt;a href=\"fuselage\"&gt;fuselage&lt;/a&gt; was flat topped and sided and deep from tail to nose. The three crew sat in &lt;a href=\"tandem\"&gt;tandem&lt;/a&gt;, separate, open oval &lt;a href=\"cockpit\"&gt;cockpit&lt;/a&gt;s, with the forward two close together over the wing and fitted with dual control. The third cockpit was spaced further away behind the &lt;a href=\"trailing%20edge\"&gt;trailing edge&lt;/a&gt; and fitted with two machine guns, one on a conventional mounting firing upwards and the other firing downwards through the fuselage underside. The rear cockpit also held the two release levers for 50\u00a0kg (110\u00a0lb) and for 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb) bombs. The braced &lt;a href=\"tailplane\"&gt;tailplane&lt;/a&gt; was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried &lt;a href=\"balanced%20rudder\"&gt;horn-balanced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"elevator%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt;s. In plan the tail was straight tapered and square tipped, with a large cut-out for rudder movement. There were several variations of the vertical tail though in all the &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; was straight edged and balanced. Some had no &lt;a href=\"fin\"&gt;fin&lt;/a&gt;, with the rudder finishing at the keel and with a nick above the fuselage, another similar but with a rudder extension to below the keel and another still with a very short fin and small &lt;a href=\"Dorsal%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;dorsal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fillet%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;fillet&lt;/a&gt; but no fin extension.\nSeveral different engines were fitted. A standard engine was a 450\u00a0hp (300\u00a0kW) &lt;a href=\"Napier%20Lion\"&gt;Napier Lion&lt;/a&gt; water-cooled &lt;a href=\"W-12%20engine\"&gt;W-12&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative was the 360\u00a0hp (270\u00a0kW) &lt;a href=\"Rolls-Royce%20Eagle%20IX\"&gt;Rolls-Royce Eagle IX&lt;/a&gt; water-cooled &lt;a href=\"V-12%20engine\"&gt;V-12 engine&lt;/a&gt;. Both drove a four blade &lt;a href=\"propeller%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;. The two engines had similar metal &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20fairing%23Engine%20cowlings\"&gt;cowlings&lt;/a&gt;, differing externally only in the number and position of the exhaust pipes (3\u00d74 on the Lion, 2\u00d76 on the Eagle) and the lower output shaft of the Eagle.\nThe T.III's alternative undercarriages were both fixed, with the two legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing and the other on the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243\u00a0kg (536\u00a0lb) to the unladened weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11\u00a0km/h (7\u00a0mph).\nOperational history.\nEarly in 1924 the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Naval%20Aviation\"&gt;Portuguese Naval Aviation&lt;/a&gt; (Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Naval Portuguesa) ordered five T.IIIs to replace their ageing &lt;a href=\"Tellier%20T.3\"&gt;Tellier T.3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flying%20boats\"&gt;flying boats&lt;/a&gt;. The first Fokker flew to Portugal at the end of August, though with a stop at &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; after about nine hours flying to rectify fuel problems. It had a wheeled undercarriage and an Eagle engine. Another F.III was crated out but when the remaining three left &lt;a href=\"Schellingwoude\"&gt;Schellingwoude&lt;/a&gt; one of them, with its crew of two, was lost in fog over the sea near &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest, France&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Portuguese had originally seen the Fokkers as vehicles for worldwide flight but these did not proceed. The remaining T.IIIs served the Portuguese Navy as &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance aircraft&lt;/a&gt; until 1928, when they were replaced by &lt;a href=\"CAMS%2037A\"&gt;CAMS 37A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amphibious%20aircraft\"&gt;amphibians&lt;/a&gt;."
