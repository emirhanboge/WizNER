The season included thrilling victories over &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%20Red%20Storm\"&gt;St. Johns&lt;/a&gt; (64-63) and &lt;a href=\"Seton%20Hall%20Pirates\"&gt;Seton Hall&lt;/a&gt; (84-80).\nSyracuse would defeat &lt;a href=\"Villanova%20Wildcats\"&gt;Villanova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; to advance to the Big East Championship game before falling to &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20Hoyas\"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt;, 69-59.\nNCAA tournament.\nAfter finishing the regular season at 28-6, the Orangemen earned a 2 seed in the East region of the NCAA Tournament.\nSyracuse played its first two tournament games at home in the Carrier Dome.

The Orangemen defeated 6 seed &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; 87-81.\nSyracuse faced 1 seed &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the regional finals. The Orangemen had to fight off the Tar Heels down the stretch as they fought to overcome a 15 point Syracuse lead. However, Syracuse was able to hold off the Tar Heels, winning 79-75 to advance to the Final Four.\nIn the semi-final game, the Orangemen defeated fellow Big East team and 6 seed &lt;a href=\"Providence%20Friars\"&gt;Providence&lt;/a&gt; 77-63.

The game was a back and forth battle down until the final whistle. The Orangemen had a one point lead with 28 seconds left in the second half when Coleman missed the front end of a one and one.

He also set records for &lt;a href=\"field%20goal%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;field goals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"free%20throw\"&gt;free throw&lt;/a&gt;s made with 53 and 51, respectively.\nDerrick Coleman's 19 &lt;a href=\"rebound%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;rebounds&lt;/a&gt; against Indiana is a school record that still stands as of 2008.
