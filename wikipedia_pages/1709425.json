Despite not being designated as either a city or a town, Nedeli\u0161\u0107e was the third most populated &lt;a href=\"Settlement%20%28Croatia%29\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in Me\u0111imurje County, after \u010cakovec and &lt;a href=\"Prelog%2C%20Croatia\"&gt;Prelog&lt;/a&gt;, with 4,320 inhabitants according to the 2011 census.\nHistory.\nNedeli\u0161\u0107e was first mentioned in 1226, in the Donation of the Hungarian King &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20IV\"&gt;B\u00e9la IV&lt;/a&gt;. The settlement was named after Sunday (, local &lt;a href=\"Kajkavian%20dialect\"&gt;Kajkavian dialect&lt;/a&gt;: \"nedelja\" or \"nedela\"), since the local people worship &lt;a href=\"The%20Holy%20Trinity\"&gt;The Holy Trinity&lt;/a&gt; to which their &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; parish is dedicated.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the place has developed into a &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28place%29\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; consisting of fairs and crafts. Between 1570 and 1586, Nedeli\u0161\u0107e was also the seat of one of the first Croatian &lt;a href=\"printing\"&gt;printing&lt;/a&gt; offices. The first document about the establishment of a local school originates from 1660, when Me\u0111imurje was reigned by the &lt;a href=\"Zrinski\"&gt;Zrinski&lt;/a&gt; family. The local &lt;a href=\"volunteer%20fire%20department\"&gt;volunteer fire department&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1908 and is the oldest in the municipality.\nGeography.\nThe main road going through the municipality is the &lt;a href=\"D3%20road%20%28Croatia%29\"&gt;D3 state road&lt;/a&gt;, connecting it with \u010cakovec to the east and &lt;a href=\"Vara%C5%BEdin\"&gt;Vara\u017edin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"D208%20road\"&gt;D208 road&lt;/a&gt; branches off of D3 road in Nedeli\u0161\u0107e and connects it with Trnovec border crossing with &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Ormo%C5%BE\"&gt;Ormo\u017e&lt;/a&gt;. There are also two railroads going through the municipality, one connecting \u010cakovec with the Slovenian town of Ormo\u017e to the west and the other one connecting the city with other Croatian cities such as &lt;a href=\"Vara%C5%BEdin\"&gt;Vara\u017edin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nSettlements.\nAside from Nedeli\u0161\u0107e itself, the municipality includes the following settlements:\nCulture and sport.\nNedeli\u0161\u0107e is also known as the host of some manifestations, most notably the largest annual business fair in Me\u0111imurje County, MESAP (Croatian: \"Me\u0111imurski sajam poduzetni\u0161tva\"), which usually takes place in June and gathers various companies from all over the county.\nThe local sports and &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt; centre, \"SGC Aton\", is considered the best-equipped gymnastics centre in the north-western Croatia. The local sports teams include the &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Nk%20nedeli%C5%A1%C4%87e\"&gt;NK Nedeli\u0161\u0107e&lt;/a&gt;, who play in the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Third%20League\"&gt;Croatian Third League&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt; club OK Nedeli\u0161\u0107e, who play in the Second Croatian Volleyball League."
