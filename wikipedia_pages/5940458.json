    "text": "House blessings (also known as house healings, house clearings, house cleansings and space clearing) are rites intended to protect the inhabitants of a house or apartment from misfortune, whether before moving into it or to \"heal\" it after an occurrence. Many religions have house blessings of one form or another.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, house blessing is an ancient tradition, that can be found in &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Christianity\"&gt;Orthodox Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, and some branches of &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt;. In Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Methodism and Orthodoxy, they are usually performed by a &lt;a href=\"pastor\"&gt;pastor&lt;/a&gt; who may sprinkle &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; (depending on denominational tradition) as he walks through every room of the house, accompanied by the occupants of the house, whilst praying for the occupants.\nHouse blessings date back to the early days of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;, the rite takes the form of a prayer, with intercessions and several &lt;a href=\"benediction\"&gt;benediction&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20salt\"&gt;Blessed salt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Religious%20use%20of%20incense\"&gt;incense&lt;/a&gt; may also be used. The Methodist \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Worship%20for%20Church%20and%20Home%20%281965%29\"&gt;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965) contains \"An Office for the Blessing of a Dwelling\". Matthew 2:11 says:\"On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.\" Consequently, Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists and Orthodox Christians often have their homes blessed at &lt;a href=\"Epiphany%20%28holiday%29\"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt;, on January 6; this blessing often starts with the Christian custom of &lt;a href=\"chalking%20the%20door\"&gt;chalking the door&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"home%20altar\"&gt;home altar&lt;/a&gt;. The custom of the Epiphanytide house blessing commemorates the visitation of the &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20Magi\"&gt;Magi&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"child%20Jesus\"&gt;child Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. The rite may also be accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"enthronement%20of%20the%20sacred%20heart\"&gt;home enthronement&lt;/a&gt;, although this is a separate ceremony and is more focused on the consecration of the occupants of the home.\nHouse blessings in the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Dutch%20Country\"&gt;Pennsylvania Dutch Country&lt;/a&gt; take the form of printed cards, framed and hung on the walls of the sitting room, and trace their origins to similar practices in &lt;a href=\"The%20Netherlands\"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Blessings, employed by Catholics and Protestants alike, usually incorporate a picture of Christ's crucifixion and a prayer \"to the Sweet Name of Jesus and His dear saints\". Many of these were printed in Belgium, and &lt;a href=\"Turnhout\"&gt;Turnhout&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Alsace\"&gt;Alsace&lt;/a&gt;, such blessings have origins in the \"Pestbriefe\" (pestilence letters) of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, sold at fairs to those wishing to protect themselves from disease, and the \"Feuerbriefe\" (fire letters) brought back by pilgrims from &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; and containing intercessory prayers to the &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20Magi\"&gt;Three Kings&lt;/a&gt; (usually with the letters \"CMB\", for &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20Magi%23Names\"&gt;Caspar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melchior\"&gt;Melchior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20Magi%23Names\"&gt;Balthasar&lt;/a&gt;, incorporated somewhere into the design) for God protecting their homes from fire and disaster. Other blessings, found in Alsace and brought to Pennsylvania, include blessings of the entranceway to a house, stable blessings invoking &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20of%20Noblac\"&gt;Saint Leonard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Blaise\"&gt;Saint Blasius&lt;/a&gt;, blessings against \"Feuer und Brand\" addressed to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Agatha\"&gt;Saint Agatha&lt;/a&gt;, and even blessings for house pets addressed to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Florentius%20%28died%20547%29\"&gt;Saint Florentius&lt;/a&gt;.\nHinduism.\nIn the Hinduism, a house blessing is conducted always before the people move in. With a new house, this is after construction is finished, but in a purchased house it will be done after purchase but before moving in. The blessing is performed by a Hindu priest and varies greatly throughout India. In Gujarat, the blessing mainly consists of performing &lt;a href=\"abhisheka\"&gt;abhisheka&lt;/a&gt; to a murti, often of Lord Ganesha, which is performed by the house-holders while the priest chants mantras. In &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional house blessing comprises the chanting of &lt;a href=\"mantra\"&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt;s, the escorting of a cow through all of the rooms, and (finally) the boiling of some of the cow's milk in the kitchen. Cow urine (komiyam) is also used for bathing.\nBuddhism.\nThe Kojangi house blessing ceremony requires one fresh whole red fish, rice with &lt;a href=\"azuki%20bean\"&gt;azuki bean&lt;/a&gt;s (\"sekihan\"), a small bottle of &lt;a href=\"sake\"&gt;sake&lt;/a&gt;, an unopened bag of rice, and a new bag of rock salt.`\nIn the Gurung culture of Nepal most families have a house blessing twice a year in March and October performed by a Lama priest. At the October blessing a new set of prayer flags are hung at the house (typically on a bamboo pole) with a blessing scarf tied at the top of the prayer flags and a mixture of grains in a bag tied at the bottom.\nMandaeism.\nOn \"Dehwa d-&lt;a href=\"%C5%A0i%C5%A1lam%20Rabba\"&gt;\u0160i\u0161lam Rabba&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Festival of the Great &lt;a href=\"Shishlam\"&gt;Shishlam&lt;/a&gt;, on the 6th-7th days of Daula, corresponding to &lt;a href=\"Epiphany%20%28holiday%29\"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt; in Christianity), &lt;a href=\"Mandaean%20priests\"&gt;Mandaean priests&lt;/a&gt; visit households and give them myrtle wreaths to hang on their houses for the rest of the year to protect against evil. The households also donate alms to the priests."
