It is in the &lt;a href=\"Chilterns\"&gt;Chilterns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Areas%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty&lt;/a&gt;, and it is owned and managed by Lane End Parish Council.\nThe site is on &lt;a href=\"London%20Clay\"&gt;London Clay&lt;/a&gt;, which is unusual for the Chilterns, and the soil is acid and sometimes waterlogged. Habitats are grassland, heath, woodland, marsh and scrub. A stream ends in a &lt;a href=\"swallow-hole\"&gt;swallow-hole&lt;/a&gt; called Gubbins Hole. There are three types of woodland, beech, oak and birch, and a small area planted with larch and pine, with ground flora of bracken and bramble. Marshy areas have &lt;a href=\"heath%20spotted%20orchid\"&gt;heath spotted orchid&lt;/a&gt; and bog mosses.\nThere is access from Church Road, which passes through the site."
