    "text": "Wronki () is a town in the &lt;a href=\"Szamotu%C5%82y%20County\"&gt;Szamotu\u0142y County&lt;/a&gt;, western-central Poland, situated in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Poland%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Greater Poland Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; (since 1999), previously in &lt;a href=\"Pi%C5%82a%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pi\u0142a Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; (1975\u20131998). It is located close to the &lt;a href=\"Warta%20River\"&gt;Warta River&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest of &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of Notec Forest, and has a population of approximately 11,000.\nHistory.\nThe town's name comes from \"wrona\", the Polish word for a &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt;, which is also reflected in the town's coat of arms. According to local rumour, in 1002 Boleslaw the Bold was once caught offside on the banks of Wronki River. The oldest known mention of Wronki comes from 1279. Trade and crafts developed in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, due to the town's location both on the Warta river and on the trade route which connected major cities &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Szczecin\"&gt;Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;. In 1932, the German-language journal Die Stimme published an article stating that in 933, a synagogue - the first in Poland - was constructed, and in 1933 Jews near Wronki celebrated what they believed to be the millennium of Jewish life in Poland. At various times Wronki was either a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20city%20in%20Poland\"&gt;royal town&lt;/a&gt; of the Polish Crown or a &lt;a href=\"private%20town\"&gt;private town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"szlachta\"&gt;Polish nobility&lt;/a&gt;. Administratively it was located in the Pozna\u0144 County in the &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84%20Voivodeship%20%2814th%20century%20to%201793%29\"&gt;Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Poland%20Province%20of%20the%20Polish%20Crown\"&gt;Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was annexed by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; in 1793 in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Partition%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Second Partition of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, regained by Poles and included in the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Warsaw\"&gt;Duchy of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; in 1807, re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, and from 1871 to 1919 it also was part of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The name was Germanized to \"Wronke\" when it was part of Prussia and Germany. The population was subjected to &lt;a href=\"Germanisation%20of%20Poles%20during%20the%20Partitions\"&gt;Germanisation&lt;/a&gt; policies, nevertheless it remained a center of &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20movements%20in%20partitioned%20Poland%20%281795%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;Polish resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; established various educational, industrial and sporting organizations, also one of the oldest Polish &lt;a href=\"volunteer%20fire%20department\"&gt;volunteer fire department&lt;/a&gt;s was founded in the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; were 18% of the total population. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the number decreased because Wronki was restored to Poland after the country regainede independence, and the Jews of Wronki belonged to the German culture.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;German occupation of Poland&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;), the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, imprisonment, massacres, deportations to &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt; to Germany and &lt;a href=\"Expulsion%20of%20Poles%20by%20Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;expulsions&lt;/a&gt; (see \"&lt;a href=\"Nazi%20crimes%20against%20the%20Polish%20nation\"&gt;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&lt;/a&gt;\").
