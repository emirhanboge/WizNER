    "text": "Gwenn ha Du (&lt;a href=\"Breton%20language\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; for \"white and black\") was a &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; group founded at the end of 1930 in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9lestin%20Lain%C3%A9\"&gt;C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. It advocated &lt;a href=\"Breton%20nationalism\"&gt;Breton nationalism&lt;/a&gt; through \"&lt;a href=\"direct%20action\"&gt;direct action&lt;/a&gt;\" and published a secret manual aimed at instructing readers in terrorism. The phrase \"Gwenn ha du\" is the nickname for the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Breton flag&lt;/a&gt;, which is in these colours.\nHistory.\nStatue bombing.\nIn July 1932, Gwenn ha Du decided to destroy a monument it found particularly offensive: a statue created by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Boucher%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Jean Boucher&lt;/a&gt; marking the union of &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in 1532. Its unveiling some twenty years earlier triggered the first protest by &lt;a href=\"breton%20nationalism\"&gt;Breton Nationalists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9lestin%20Lain%C3%A9\"&gt;C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; made a &lt;a href=\"bomb\"&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt; in his bedroom, consisting of a &lt;a href=\"condensed%20milk\"&gt;condensed milk&lt;/a&gt; carton filled with &lt;a href=\"nitroglycerine\"&gt;nitroglycerine&lt;/a&gt;. In the early hours of August 7, he set the bomb behind the head of the King of France's statue in the facade opposite the &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;'s office. At 4:00 a.m., the bomb detonated, shattering the &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; statue and all &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; within 100 metres. On August 7, the group claimed responsibility for the attack, which was intended to coincide with the 400th anniversary celebration of the union, taking place in &lt;a href=\"Vannes\"&gt;Vannes&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of French prime minister &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Herriot\"&gt;\u00c9douard Herriot&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Humanit%C3%A9\"&gt;L'Humanit\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"French%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, spoke out the day after, protesting that Herriot didn't mention that all &lt;a href=\"Celt\"&gt;Celt&lt;/a&gt;ic civilisation was wiped out, the refusal to acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Breton%20language\"&gt;Breton language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breton%20culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;. The authorities arrested six militants on August 11; the six remained imprisoned for fifty days.\nLater attacks.\nThe Gwenn ha du, which presented itself as the unofficial military wing of the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20National%20Breton\"&gt;Parti National Breton&lt;/a&gt;, followed up with a few months of action. On November 20, Gwenn ha du members detonated a bomb on the &lt;a href=\"railway\"&gt;railway&lt;/a&gt; line between &lt;a href=\"Ingrandes%2C%20Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Ingrandes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Champtoc%C3%A9\"&gt;Champtoc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, not long before \u00c9douard Herriot's arrival there. The train stopped in front of the damaged rails. However, Herriot eventually got to &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; in time to celebrate the act of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20between%20Brittany%20and%20France\"&gt;Union between Brittany and France&lt;/a&gt;. Three more attacks followed: April 13, 1936, with &lt;a href=\"arson\"&gt;arson&lt;/a&gt; in four &lt;a href=\"pr%C3%A9fecture\"&gt;pr\u00e9fecture&lt;/a&gt;s; December 18, 1938, with the blowing up of a &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Monument%20de%20la%20F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20bretonne-angevine\"&gt;Monument de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration bretonne-angevine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pontivy\"&gt;Pontivy&lt;/a&gt;); and the attack in the pr\u00e9fecture of &lt;a href=\"Quimper%2C%20Finist%C3%A8re\"&gt;Quimper&lt;/a&gt; on February 28, 1939.\nDissolution.\nA last attack was suspected on 13 May 1941 against &lt;a href=\"Carhaix\"&gt;Carhaix&lt;/a&gt; gendarmerie station after a statement was sent to members of the National Council in Vichy, threatening more attacks if the borders of the traditional province of Brittany were not recognised. After this the group ceased to function, its members becoming part of various &lt;a href=\"milice\"&gt;milice&lt;/a&gt; groups working with the German occupying forces. Lain\u00e9 himself led the &lt;a href=\"Bezen%20Perrot\"&gt;Bezen Perrot&lt;/a&gt; militia, which included former Gwenn ha du activists. After the war, surviving members were either captured or fled France. Some were later associated with the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20Front%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Liberation Front of Brittany&lt;/a&gt;, which was active in the 1960s."
