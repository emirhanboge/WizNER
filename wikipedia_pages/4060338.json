    "text": "The Manor Ground was a &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; stadium in &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, England, the home of &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as &lt;a href=\"Headington\"&gt;Headington&lt;/a&gt; United) between 1925 and 2001. It hosted United's record crowd of 22,750 against &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; 6th Round match on 29 February 1964.\n \nThe main seating stand was the Beech Road stand (on the west), the 'home' terracing was the London Road stand (south), the 'away' terracing was Cuckoo Lane (north) and on the fourth side was the Osler Road stand (east). In 1966, with the demolition of Sandfield College, a new entrance to the ground was created onto London Road.\nWith the advent of the 1990s and the &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Report\"&gt;Taylor Report&lt;/a&gt;, the Manor Ground's &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;terracing&lt;/a&gt; was rapidly becoming antiquated, and it gained a reputation amongst fans as one of the more dilapidated stadiums in English professional football. The location of the Manor Ground was unsuitable for conversion into an all-seater stadium, so the club decided to move to a purpose-built all-seater stadium (later to be named the &lt;a href=\"Kassam%20Stadium\"&gt;Kassam Stadium&lt;/a&gt;) on the outskirts of the city, on land near the &lt;a href=\"Blackbird%20Leys\"&gt;Blackbird Leys&lt;/a&gt; housing estate. Construction work began in the early part of 1997, but was suspended later that year because of the club's financial problems. Construction of the new stadium resumed in 1999 following a takeover deal and Oxford moved there in 2001.\nThe last league match at the Manor, on 1 May 2001, was a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Scott%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29\"&gt;Andy Scott&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring after 82 minutes as the Us looked set for a final home victory, but a minute from the end &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Naylor\"&gt;Tony Naylor&lt;/a&gt; equalised. Oxford's final season at the Manor Ground was one of the worst in their history. They finished bottom of &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Division Two&lt;/a&gt; with 27 points and were relegated to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Division Three&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest standing in 35 years.\nThe stadium was later demolished and is now the site of The Manor Hospital, a &lt;a href=\"private%20hospital\"&gt;private hospital&lt;/a&gt; owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Nuffield%20Health\"&gt;Nuffield Health&lt;/a&gt;."
