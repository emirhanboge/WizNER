    "text": "Lucius Cornelius L. f. Merula was &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Minucius%20Thermus%20%28consul%20193%20BC%29\"&gt;Quintus Minucius Thermus&lt;/a&gt;, in 193 BC. His province was &lt;a href=\"Gallia%20Cisalpina\"&gt;Gallia Cisalpina&lt;/a&gt;. Merula closed an active predatory campaign by a total defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Boii\"&gt;Boian&lt;/a&gt; Gauls in the neighbourhood of &lt;a href=\"Modena\"&gt;Mutina&lt;/a&gt;. Since his staff officer &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus%20%28consul%20196%20BC%29\"&gt;Marcus Claudius Marcellus&lt;/a&gt; accused him of a delay in sending forward a reserve unit, resulting in several thousand unnecessary casualties and the escape of many enemy soldiers, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Senate\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt; refused him a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20triumph\"&gt;triumph&lt;/a&gt;."
