    "text": "The 2011 Super League season (known as the Engage Super League XVI for sponsorship reasons) was the 16th season of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football since the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; format was introduced in 1996. Fourteen teams competed for the &lt;a href=\"League%20Leaders%27%20Shield\"&gt;League Leaders' Shield&lt;/a&gt; over 27 rounds (including the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weekend\"&gt;Magic Weekend&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Stadium\"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt;), after which the highest finishing teams entered the play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final and a chance to win the championship and the Super League Trophy. &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; claimed their fifth Super League crown, tying the record previously held by &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington Wolves&lt;/a&gt; lifted the League Leaders' Shield.\nThe season kicked off on 12 February with the Annual \"Millennium Magic Weekend\", which was brought forward from its usual slot in May. All clubs also participated in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; tournament.\nThe first game of the new season was Warrington Wolves vs &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield Giants&lt;/a&gt;, a repeat of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Challenge%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2009 Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; and a repeat of the classic play-off match between the two sides. Former Giants captain and Warrington Full Back &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Hodgson\"&gt;Brett Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; made his debut for his new club against his old one.\nThe 2011 season included the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20International%20Origin%20Match\"&gt;Rugby League International Origin Match&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;England national rugby league team&lt;/a&gt; played the RL Exiles, an outfit made up of Australians and New Zealanders playing for Super League clubs. This contest is intended to henceforth become an annual fixture to replace the previously existing annual test against the &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;France national rugby league team&lt;/a&gt;, due to the onesidedness of such contests in recent years.\nTeams.\nSuper League XVI was the third year of a &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9311%20Super%20League%20licences\"&gt;licensed Super League&lt;/a&gt;. Under this system, promotion and relegation between Super League and &lt;a href=\"Championship%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; was abolished, and 14 teams were granted licences subject to certain criteria. All twelve teams from Super League XIII were given places, as well as former Super League team &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford City Reds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;. This was the final year of the initial licensing cycle; a new set of licences &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9314%20Super%20League%20licences\"&gt;would be awarded for 2012\u201314&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeographically, the vast majority of teams in Super League are based in the north of England, four teams \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 to the west of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pennines\"&gt;the Pennines&lt;/a&gt; in Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, and seven teams to the east in Yorkshire \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Catalans%20Dragons\"&gt;Catalans Dragons&lt;/a&gt; are the only team based in France and are outside of the UK, &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; are the only team in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"London%20Broncos\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt; are the only team to be based in a capital city (London).\nThe maps below indicate the locations of teams that competed in Super League XVI.\n&lt;a href=\"Catalans%20Dragons\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Saints&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Reds&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull KR&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Tigers&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Rhinos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wildcats&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;\nPlay-offs.\nThe play-offs commenced following the conclusion of the 27-round regular season. To decide the grand finalists from the top eight finishing teams, Super League uses its unique &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20play-offs\"&gt;play-off system&lt;/a&gt;.
