It was assigned to the Northern Fleet.\nService history.\n\"K-324\"s &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 29 February 1980 at &lt;a href=\"Komsomolsk%20Shipyard\"&gt;Komsomolsk Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Komsomolsk-on-Amur\"&gt;Komsomolsk-on-Amur&lt;/a&gt; in the Russian Far East. It was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 7 October 1980 and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 30 December 1980. It was the seventh submarine of the class built at Komsomolsk.\nCollision.\nIn 1981, \"K-324\" collided with an unidentified submarine of the , purportedly , in &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great%20Bay\"&gt;Peter the Great Bay&lt;/a&gt;, not far from &lt;a href=\"Vladivostok\"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;. The submarine was heavily damaged, to all reports. The United States government denied any of their submarines were in the area, and no US submarine reported any damage during that time period, but the Soviets reported none of their submarines were in the Bay aside from \"K-324\".\nFleet transfer and operations.\n\"K-324\" transited across the Arctic in November and was officially transferred to the Northern Fleet on 3 December 1982.\nDisabled.\nOn 31 October 1983, \"K-324\" snagged the US &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; 's &lt;a href=\"Towed%20array%20sonar\"&gt;towed sonar array&lt;/a&gt; cable west of &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, causing damage to the submarine's propeller. The submarine was towed to &lt;a href=\"Cienfuegos\"&gt;Cienfuegos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; for repairs by a Soviet &lt;a href=\"salvage%20ship\"&gt;salvage ship&lt;/a&gt; beginning on 5 November. Soviet technicians recovered some parts of \"McCloy\"s array.\nLater activities and decommissioning.\n\"K-324\" was again involved in operations around US waters in 1985. She was reported to have detected American &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20missile%20submarine\"&gt;SSBNs&lt;/a&gt; on three occasions, tailing them for 28 hours. \"K-324\" took advantage of temperature variations in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Stream\"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;. \"K-324\" was in reserve by 1997. \"K-324\" was written off in 2000 for &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;scrapping&lt;/a&gt;."
