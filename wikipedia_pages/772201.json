    "text": "Lechia Gda\u0144sk () is a Polish &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;. The club was founded in 1945 by people &lt;a href=\"Polish%20population%20transfers%20%281944%E2%80%931946%29\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, who were supporters of Poland's oldest football team &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Lechia Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1903. The club's name comes from &lt;a href=\"Lechia\"&gt;Lechia&lt;/a&gt;, a poetic name for Poland, and is a continuation of the name used by the club based in Lw\u00f3w. In their early years, Lechia enjoyed some success, most notably finishing third in the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Polish top division&lt;/a&gt;, before spending decades in the second and third tiers. In the early 1980s, Lechia won the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;Polish SuperCup&lt;/a&gt;, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt;, with the club's most recent success coming in 2019, finishing third in the league and again winning both the Polish Cup and SuperCup.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1945\u20131948).\nThe club was founded on 7 August 1945 in &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; and was originally named \"BOP Baltia Gda\u0144sk\". The club was first established by the \"Port Reconstruction Office\" (). The BOP's purpose was to help rebuild Polish sea ports which were destroyed during World War II, and saw it best to create a sports club for the BOP workers. BOP Baltia's first game came on 2 September 1945, in which they lost the game 6\u20134 against Milicyjnym Klubem Sportowym z Wrzeszcza (Militia Sports Club from Wrzeszcz) in a friendly. BOP Baltia's first league game was a week later and played against WKS 16 Dywizji (Military Sports Club of the 16th Division). Due to the disruption of football in Poland due to the war the first season back was focused on regional qualifying for leagues to reformat the Polish football leagues. In the Gda\u0144sk regional qualifying Lechia won all 6 games including both games in their first &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk%20Derby\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk Derby&lt;/a&gt; games against &lt;a href=\"Gedania%201922%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gedania Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, winning the group and being promoted to the A Klasa (A Class, the second division in Poland at the time).\nTowards the end of February 1946, BOP officials had a meeting, in which it was decided that the name of the club should be changed. The team became known as \"Sports Club for the Port Reconstruction Office Lechia Gda\u0144sk\" (), 'Lechia' coming from &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Lechia Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, as a majority of the workers at BOP and those who studied at the &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; had been &lt;a href=\"Population%20exchange%20between%20Poland%20and%20Soviet%20Ukraine\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; at the end of WW2.\nLechia fared well in its early years in the lower divisions finishing top of their district championships in both the 1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348 seasons. For Lechia to be promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;top division&lt;/a&gt; they needed to win additional qualifying rounds against the other district champions, playing a series of games in playoff games, before a final playoff league with four teams of five being promoted. In the playoffs for the 1946\u201347 season Lechia finished bottom of the playoff league, being the only team not to advance to the top division. Lechia's fortunes changed the following season however and achieved promotion at the end of the 1947\u201348 season when they finished top of the promotion playoffs league.\nFirst years of top flight football (1949\u20131954).\nIn &lt;a href=\"1949%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt; Lechia played in the top flight for the first time (at this time the top division was called the \"I liga\"). While it was a historic year for the club, and showed the competitiveness of the team in their early years to play in the top division, it was not a season to be enjoyed by Lechia in terms of on field performances, winning only 4 games all season and losing an incredible 15 times out of 22 games, finishing bottom of the league as a result. Due to suffering relegation in their first Ekstraklasa season the club found themselves back in the second tier of Polish football in 1950. Their first year in the II liga was a year of transition and the team initially struggled finishing 6th out of 10 teams, and finding themselves way off the pace for an immediate return to the top division. The league format of the II liga was changed for the 1951 season, where in the previous season the division was split into two groups with both winners being promoted, the 1951 season saw the II liga being split into four groups with the group winners playing each other in a mini playoff league with the top two being promoted to the Ekstraklasa. Lechia won their group which was the most diverse group at the time, playing against teams in &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; who were both across the country from Gda\u0144sk. The team advanced to the playoff league and came up against &lt;a href=\"Wawel%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;OWKS Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20Wa%C5%82brzych%20%28football%29\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik Wa\u0142brzych&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gwardia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Gwardia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, winning the playoffs group on goal difference and being promoted back to the I liga with OWKS Krak\u00f3w.\nThe 1952 season was an unusual one due to the &lt;a href=\"1952%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1952 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Helsinki. The start of the league was delayed due to the preparation of forming a team to go to the Olympics. As a result of this the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Leaders%20Rally%20Cup\"&gt;Young Leaders Rally Cup&lt;/a&gt; was organised, and was the first &lt;a href=\"League%20Cup%20in%20Polish%20Football\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Polish football. The organising of the cup was to give the players an opportunity to show off their skills, and with a more relaxed competition compared to the league would provide the Polish team with the best possible preparation to perform well at the Olympics. The cup ran from April \u2013 July and initially saw two groups where each team played each other twice, with the top three teams in each group going through to the playoffs to decide the winner and the final standings. Lechia finished 3rd in their group and thus played against &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; who also finished 3rd in their group to play in the 5th placed playoff. Lech won the game 2\u20131, meaning Lechia finished in 6th place overall in the Young Leaders Rally Cup. After the Olympics, in which Poland were knocked out in the first round, the league officially started, around five months later than it usually would. The league took a similar format to the cup, with the teams being split into two groups, with the two winners playing each other to decide on that years champions. Lechia finished the disruptive season in 7th place, ensuing they remained in the league for the following season. The 1953 season returned to normality with one league and each team playing each other twice. The season saw Lechia struggle and finish bottom of the league, and were again relegated from the top division finding the increased level of competitiveness difficult to deal with over the course of a full season.\nBeing back in the II liga Lechia once again found themselves to be competitive. While the club struggled more so than the teams around them in terms of scoring goals, Lechia were the best team defensively in the league, shown by their ability to keep clean sheets, having 12 clean sheets in their 20 games. The team finished the season on 28 points, the same as &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Sosnowiec\"&gt;Stal Sosnowiec&lt;/a&gt; who ended up winning the league, but found themselves finish in second place due in part to Stal scoring 10 more goals than Lechia and having a much better goal difference. The immediate promotion and return to the I liga showed that at the time the club were in a position where they were competitive, but too good for the second division, yet struggled against the much better organised clubs in the first division.\nEarly \"Golden Years\" and top division stay (1955\u20131963).\nUpon Lechias return to the Ekstraklasa, the players involved during these years and the initial success of the team upon their return to the I liga, were therefore seen as being the club's \"golden years\" of their early history. Players such as &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Adamczyk\"&gt;Bogdan Adamczyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Gronowski\"&gt;Henryk Gronowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gronowski\"&gt;Robert Gronowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Korynt\"&gt;Roman Korynt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Kusz\"&gt;Hubert Kusz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czes%C5%82aw%20Lenc\"&gt;Czes\u0142aw Lenc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czes%C5%82aw%20Nowicki\"&gt;Czes\u0142aw Nowicki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rogocz\"&gt;Roman Rogocz&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom had long playing careers with Lechia, were all important in making the club competitive upon their return to the league. Their first season back, &lt;a href=\"1955%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;, was at the time the clubs most successful season in their history. On their way to a 5th place finish in the league, their highest at that point, they beat strong teams at the time such as &lt;a href=\"%C5%81KS%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Sosnowiec\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Sosnowiec&lt;/a&gt;, and the 1955 Polish champions &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. The season also provided the chance for the clubs first piece of silverware by reaching the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt; final for the first time. Lechia's route in the Polish Cup () to the final saw them beating &lt;a href=\"Sandecja%20Nowy%20S%C4%85cz\"&gt;Sandecja Nowy S\u0105cz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odra%20Opole\"&gt;Odra Opole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gwardia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Gwardia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. The final saw Lechia play Legia Warsaw at the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Wojska%20Polskiego\"&gt;Polish Army Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Legia's home stadium. Lechia lost the game 5\u20130 after a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Kempny\"&gt;Kempny&lt;/a&gt;, and a goal each from &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Pohl\"&gt;Pohl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20S%C5%82aboszowski\"&gt;S\u0142aboszowski&lt;/a&gt; seeing them finish as runners-up in the cup, and only the second team formed after the Second World War to feature in the Polish Cup final. \nIn the league, the 1956 season was more successful than the year prior, seeing Lechia finish on the podium for the first time, with the club also becoming the first formed after the war to finish in the top three. Despite only scoring 25 goals in 22 games, Lechia finished the season in 3rd place. The club relied heavily on their defence that season keeping 10 clean sheets and conceding only 21, the second lowest in the league that season, while their highest goal scorer was &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rogocz\"&gt;Rogocz&lt;/a&gt; who scored only 7 for the club that season in the league. The achievement of 3rd place happened under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Fory%C5%9B\"&gt;Tadeusz Fory\u015b&lt;/a&gt;, arguably Lechia's greatest manager in their earlier years, seeing them promoted from the second tier, taking them to a cup final, and achieving their highest finish of 3rd place.\nThe following season saw Lechia remaining competitive, but with the defensive side of the team not performing as well for the team as they went on to finish in 5th place. Once again the team only scored 25 goals in 22 games, the joint second lowest in the league, and the only team to not score more than 25 goals to not be relegated. Despite only scoring 25 goals that season in the league the team did see a player scoring the clubs first hat-trick in the top division, with &lt;a href=\"Bronis%C5%82aw%20Szlagowski\"&gt;Bronis\u0142aw Szlagowski&lt;/a&gt; scoring 3 in a 5\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Sosnowiec\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Sosnowiec&lt;/a&gt;. While defensively the team wasn't as strong as in 1956, the 29 goals they conceded, which was still among the better sides in the division, ensured the team finished in the top half of the league for a third successive season. At the end of the season, Tadeusz Fory\u015b, who saw Lechia's rise from the II liga to being a challenger for the top places in the I liga, left Lechia to manage &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the departure of Fory\u015b who made Lechia defensively strong, the teams fortunes declined from the &lt;a href=\"1958%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; with one notable difference from the previous season being the amount of goals the team conceded. The side fell to 8th place, just surviving relegation by a single point. This was a trend which was to continue for Lechia. While the team improved to finish 6th in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt; season, the team only managed to score 19 goals in their 22 games, with only one team scoring fewer, &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Sosnowiec\"&gt;Stal Sosnowiec&lt;/a&gt;, who finished bottom of the league. The next three seasons saw the team flirting with relegation, finishing 9th in &lt;a href=\"1960%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;, scoring the joint fewest in the league and surviving relegation by a point, 8th in &lt;a href=\"1961%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;, scoring the joint second least in the league but surviving more comfortably by 5 points, and finishing 9th again in &lt;a href=\"1962%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;. The 1962 saw a change in the league format, with the season changing from a summer league (playing from spring-autumn) to it becoming a winter league (playing autumn-spring). The league for that season was therefore shorter, with teams playing a total of 13 games, 12 in a mini league, and once in a playoff game to formalise the final standings. \nOver these years where Lechia struggled, some of the players who were important in the clubs rise during the early and mid 1950's started to move away or retire. Henryk Gronowski initially left in 1961, but later returned over the summer in 1963, his brother, and one of Lechia's most important forwards for Lechia during this era, Robert Gronowski, left in 1960, the ever present defenders Hubert Kusz and Czes\u0142aw Lenc left in 1960 and 1962, and Roman Rogocz, who scored more than 100 goals for Lechia during his 15 year career at the club, retired in 1962. Each of these players made more then 100 appearances in the I liga for Lechia, leaving Lechia without the quality and experience these players provided. This loss of quality was evident during the &lt;a href=\"1962%E2%80%9363%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1962-63&lt;/a&gt; season which ended up being a difficult one for Lechia. In the 26 games that season, they only managed to win 6, drawing 3, with the side losing 17, scoring only 20 goals, and conceding 48. This caused the team to finish second from bottom, being 4 points from safety, and were relegated from the Ekstraklasa with Lech Pozna\u0144, ending their 9 season long spell of continuous top division football.\nDecline and fall to the third division (1963\u20131971).\nWhile some of Lechia's important players remained at the club after their relegation, including long serving players such as; &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Adamczyk\"&gt;Bogdan Adamczyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Apolewicz\"&gt;Jerzy Apolewicz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Janusz%20Charczuk\"&gt;Janusz Charczuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Korynt\"&gt;Roman Korynt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czes%C5%82aw%20Nowicki\"&gt;Czes\u0142aw Nowicki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zbigniew%20%C5%BBemojtel\"&gt;Zbigniew \u017bemojtel&lt;/a&gt;, and the return of &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Gronowski\"&gt;Henryk Gronowski&lt;/a&gt; after the clubs relegation, the squad struggled to adapt to falling down a division. That season Lechia lost more games than they managed to win, and were only able to secure a 10th placed finish out of 16 teams. Lechia did adapt to the new division better than Lech Pozna\u0144 however who suffered back to back relegations, showing the rise in competitiveness since the last time Lechia were in the II liga.\nFrom their second season Lechia had adapted to the league and increased their competitiveness, finding themselves in 7th for the 1964\u201365 season. This season saw Lechia playing &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, with the two clubs quickly becoming fierce rivals and leading to the &lt;a href=\"Tricity%20Derby\"&gt;Tricity Derby&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia won the first ever meeting between the two clubs with the game finishing 2\u20131. The club also saw in improvement the following year by finishing in 6th for the 1965\u201366 season. While these seasons were an improvement on their first season back in the second tier, Lechia never found themselves more than 4 points clear from relegation, the equivalent of 2 wins during that period. This shows that while Lechia were finishing in the mid-table, they were only one bad season, or one bad run of games from finishing in the relegation zone.\nThis possibility of a bad run of games leading to Lechia being relegated became a reality in the 1966\u201367 season, which saw a winless run of 8 games, including a run of 5 straight defeats without scoring a goal in this run. Lechia were relegated by a single point at the end of the season, and were to be playing in the third tier for the first time in their history.\nLechia will have expected to be competitive following their fall to the &lt;a href=\"II%20liga\"&gt;III liga&lt;/a&gt;, and the team proved that they could be. Their first season saw them finishing in 2nd, however they were clear behind &lt;a href=\"Arkonia%20Szczecin\"&gt;Arkonia Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;, and although they did finish in 2nd place, only the league winners from the four groups of the third division were promoted. The 1967\u201368 season also saw Lechia's first &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk%20Derby\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk Derby&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"SKS%20Stoczniowiec%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stoczniowiec Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, despite both teams being formed in 1945 it took 22 years before they met in a competitive setting. Stoczniowiec won the first derby between the two clubs 2\u20131, in a derby that would go on to be played often over the next two decades. At the end of the season, the long serving forward who had three spells with Lechia, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Adamczyk\"&gt;Bogdan Adamczyk&lt;/a&gt;, retired from playing football. Adamczyk was the last remaining player who had featured for the club during their \"Golden Years\" the decade before. Although one club legend retired, the following season saw the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Puszkarz\"&gt;Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz&lt;/a&gt;, a youngster from the Lechia academy, who would one day become a club legend himself. The season didn't go as planned for Lechia, with the team finishing in 5th, and seeing their rivals Arka top the league.\nOver the next three years however Lechia maintained a consistent challenge on fighting for the league title. The 1968\u201369 season saw Lechia finishing in 3rd place, conceding only 18 in 30 league games, and keeping an impressive 18 clean sheets. Lechia were still off the pace needed to mount a challenge for a title, but the club had seen improvements since the previous season. The next season Lechia had improved to a 2nd placed finish, losing only 3 games all season, including losing to eventual champions Lech Pozna\u0144, and finishing only 1 point behind Lech, meaning the loss to Lech in the penultimate game of the season may have cost Lechia's chance of winning the league themselves. Lechia did not have to wait long however to win the league for themselves and make a return to the II liga. In the 1971\u201372 season Lechia won 22 of their 30 games, clearly winning the league with having a 9 point gap to Stoczniowiec in 2nd place, having the second best attack in the league, and by far the best defence in the league conceding only 13 goals and keeping 21 clean sheets, this despite the fact that of the 4 league defeats that season, 3 of them came in Lechia's first 4 league games.\nA decade in the second division (1972\u20131982).\nAfter finding themselves in the second division Lechia performed well and comfortably finished above the relegation zone in 7th place, winning and losing 9 games each over the season, and drawing 12, of which 8 were 0\u20130 draws. This followed the trend of Lechia not scoring many, but being set up well defensively, with the high amount of extra points picked up from draws helping them to finish clear of the bottom 4. The 1973\u201374 season saw a change of format in the II liga, which was originally just a single league of 16 teams. From this season the division was split into two leagues of 16 teams each and 32 teams in total, a Northern group and a Southern group, with Lechia being placed in the Northern group. This change made it harder for teams to gain promotion from the division as they now had to win the league, where as before finishing as runners-up was good enough for promotion to the I liga. Lechia finished 4th in the league, in what was generally an average season for the team, but due to the top 3 teams taking so many points from the lower placed teams in the league Lechia recorded a high finish, with players such as &lt;a href=\"Tomasz%20Korynt\"&gt;Tomasz Korynt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrzej%20G%C5%82ownia\"&gt;Andrzej G\u0142ownia&lt;/a&gt; having standout seasons.\nThe 1974\u201375 season saw a vast improvement from the team, winning 16 of their 30 games, and losing only 6. The club also improved in goals scored, while also being the joint best team defensively. Tomasz Korynt, &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Radowski\"&gt;Leonard Radowski&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Puszkarz\"&gt;Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz&lt;/a&gt; each managed 8 goals in the league that season as Lechia went on to finish in 2nd place, only 2 points of the league winners &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;. This season also saw Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz called up to the &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; national team to play against East Germany, despite Lechia playing in the second division. The following season was a good season for the &lt;a href=\"Tricity%2C%20Poland\"&gt;Tricity&lt;/a&gt; region with the 4 teams in the league from the region all finishing in the top 5 places. Once again Lechia had a strong season, this time only losing 4 games, but again finished in 2nd place, this time 3 points behind rivals Arka Gdynia. 1976\u201377 was a little blip in Lechia's run of high finishing seasons, managing 5th in the league, and their lowest finish since the league split into two groups. Lechia resumed their title fight from the following season, being the clear best team in the league along with &lt;a href=\"Gwardia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Gwardia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, with both teams recording over 20 wins and losing only 2 games all season, and finishing nearly 20 points clear of &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%82tyk%20Gdynia\"&gt;Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; in 3rd place. &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Matuszewski\"&gt;Krzysztof Matuszewski&lt;/a&gt; also recorded 15 goals over the season, among the highest in the league. While Lechia were close to winning the league, it was once again not enough, with the club being a single point from winning the league. \nFrom the 1978\u201379 season the leagues were changed from a Northern and Southern group to Eastern and Western groups. The change didn't initially impact the club, with Lechia finishing in 3rd place, missing out on promotion by a single point for the second successive season. Lechia also went on a cup run, playing &lt;a href=\"Gryf%20S%C5%82upsk\"&gt;Gryf S\u0142upsk&lt;/a&gt;, Wielim Szczecinek, &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unia%20Tarn%C3%B3w\"&gt;Unia Tarn\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; on their way to reaching the quarterfinals. Lechia lost in the quarterfinals to eventual runners-up &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia's fortunes in the II liga did start to change, and after narrowly missing out on promotion in four of the last five seasons, the club found themselves slipping down into mid-table finishes the next two seasons. 6th and 7th placed finishes in seasons where Lechia nearly won, drew and lost the same amount of games each time saw the club looking far less competitive and saw the departure of talismanic midfielder Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz in 1981. It was evident in 1981\u201382 that Puszkarz, a life long Lechia fan and a player who had been seen as too good for the second tier for many years, hugely contributed to the clubs fortunes and was irreplaceable for the team on the pitch. Lechia fell to 14th after winning only 6 of their 30 games, scored only 19 goals, and ended up 7 points from safety. Lechia were relegated to the third tier, this time without any star players or big names to help the club out.\n'Rebirth', cup wins, and Ekstraklasa football (1982\u20131988).\nAlthough Lechia found themselves in the third tier for the 1982\u201383 season, it turned out to be a historic year for the club, and was seen as the club's 'rebirth'. The team finished top of their division, going on to concede only 9 goals in their 26 games. Due to Lechia being in the third tier they joined the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. The first game of the competition saw them play Start Radziejow, who they narrowly beat 3\u20132 on penalties. The cup saw them playing 4 Ekstraklasa teams on their route to the final. They beat &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20134 on penalties, after drawing 1\u20131, &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the round of 16, &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Sosnowiec\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Sosnowiec&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the quarter-finals, and &lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w\"&gt;Ruch Chorz\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-finals 4\u20133 on penalties. The final saw them playing &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt; who were in the second tier. They won the final 2\u20131 with goals from &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20G%C3%B3rski\"&gt;Krzysztof G\u00f3rski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marek%20Kowalczyk\"&gt;Marek Kowalczyk&lt;/a&gt; to win their first-ever piece of silverware.\nIn 1983\u201384 Lechia were again in the second tier (west group), and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;Polish SuperCup&lt;/a&gt; () due to winning the Polish Cup the season before. It was the first-ever season of the Super Cup, and saw the cup winning team play the Ekstraklasa champions, resulting in Lechia playing &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Lech being heavy favourites Lechia &lt;a href=\"1983%20Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;won the Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; with a late goal from &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Kruszczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jerzy Kruszczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in 1983 being the most successful season in the club's history up to that point, with the team winning both cup competitions it participated in despite not being in the top division. Lechia's stay out of the Ekstraklasa wasn't to last long, however, with the team winning the 1983\u201384 II Liga season, and as a result were promoted back to the Ekstraklasa. A division they had narrowly missed out of playing in many seasons before, and was their first time back in the top tier for 21 seasons. That season Lechia also qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; due to winning the Polish Cup the season before. In the first round, Lechia was drawn to Italian footballing giants, &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;. The first game was played in Turin, Italy, with Juventus easily winning 7\u20130. With the team knowing they were all but knocked out already the team put on an inspiring performance scoring 2 goals against the European giants in the home leg of the competition. The Lechia home game against Juventus was not only a sporting spectacle, but proved to be a place of mass demonstration for the \"&lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt;\" movement, which many fans were part of. In the 40,000 crowd was &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt;, with the crowds chants of \"Solidarno\u015b\u0107! Solidarno\u015b\u0107! Solidarno\u015b\u0107!\" causing the second half to be delayed by 6 minutes and with broadcasters resulting to mute the whole second half of the TVs broadcast. The Lechia manager, &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Jastrz%C4%99bowski\"&gt;Jerzy Jastrz\u0119bowski&lt;/a&gt;, said of the event; \"We were in the dressing room during half-time when we heard it and it sent shivers down our spines, the whole ground singing 'Solidarnosc'.\"\nFor the &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1984\u201385 Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; season, a season in which all teams struggled for goals (an average of 1 goal a game), Lechia finished 12th having scored 23 goals, and with only 2 of their wins that season coming from scoring 2 more goals than their opponents. The season after Lechia finished just above the relegation zone by a single point, and seeing local rivals &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%82tyk%20Gdynia\"&gt;Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; getting relegated a place below. Lechia was lucky that season, with the team finishing 3rd from bottom, with four teams normally getting relegated. However, a change to the division below saw only 2 teams going down that season. 1986\u201387 saw the team once again fighting relegation. For the 3rd season in a row, Lechia only managed 23 goals in their league 30 games, however, the team once again stayed up finishing in 11th. The team were once more fighting a relegation battle during the &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1987-88&lt;/a&gt; season. Lechia legend &lt;a href=\"Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Puszkarz\"&gt;Puszkarz&lt;/a&gt; rejoined the team after having left 5 seasons prior. It had always been his dream to play for Lechia in the top flight, and this was the season where he achieved this accomplishment however it didn't go according to plan. Despite the team finishing in 12th, which would normally be one position above the relegation zone, for that season though there was a relegation playoff, with 14th playing 11th, and 13th playing 12th. Lechia played &lt;a href=\"Olimpia%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Olimpia Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; in the relegation playoff and lost over both legs 3\u20132 on aggregate. This saw Lechia being relegated with &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt;, the other team who would otherwise have normally been safe also suffered relegation after they lost both legs 4\u20133 to &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20Wa%C5%82brzych\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik Wa\u0142brzych&lt;/a&gt; on aggregate. The following season the relegation playoffs in the Ekstraklasa were scrapped.\nLower leagues and mergers (1988\u20132001).\nAfter relegation from the Ekstraklasa, Lechia found themselves back in the II liga. During the 1988\u201389 season Lechia struggled to adapt to the new league, finishing 10th out of 16. Things failed to improve for Lechia during the next two seasons, finishing both 11th and 12th. The situation slightly improved for Lechia during the 1991\u201392 and the 1993\u201394 seasons finishing in 8th before their highest finish of 6th since being relegated. During this period there was a greater rivalry with the three major &lt;a href=\"Tricity%2C%20Poland\"&gt;Tricity&lt;/a&gt; clubs, Lechia representing &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%82tyk%20Gdynia\"&gt;Ba\u0142tyk&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;. The 1993\u201394 season was an important season for the Tricity teams. &lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%82tyk%20Gdynia\"&gt;Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; finished highest in the league for the 3rd season in a row, while both Lechia and &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka&lt;/a&gt; faced each other for the first time in history in the 1993\u201394 Polish Cup, with Arka winning the match 1\u20130. The season was another difficult one for Lechia, in which they finished 14th, 1 place above the relegation zone. The struggles for Lechia reached a devastating end by the end of the 1994\u201395 season, with the team, ultimately being relegated to the 3rd Division, along with fellow rivals Arka Gdynia.\nThe 1995\u201396 season saw Lechia merge with &lt;a href=\"Olimpia%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Olimpia Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, becoming &lt;a href=\"Olimpia-Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Olimpia-Lechia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;. Olimpia-Lechia Gda\u0144sk played in the top division, while the continuation of the Lechia Gda\u0144sk team played in the 3rd division, with the Lechia Gda\u0144sk side being used as the team's official &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20team\"&gt;second team&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1995\u201396 Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; season Lechia-Olimpia Gda\u0144sk finished 16th, and were ultimately relegated. The second team (Lechia Gda\u0144sk) also narrowly miss relegation, finishing just above the relegation places. At the end of the 1995\u201396 season Lechia\u2013Olympia Gda\u0144sk was renamed as Lechia Gda\u0144sk, promoting the team from the 3rd division to the 2nd. The new Lechia team failed to capitalize on the return to the second division by being relegated to the 3rd division straight away. The 1997\u201398 season was a better season for Lechia with the team finishing in 3rd place in the III liga.\nBefore the 1998\u201399 season Lechia had their 2nd merger within 3 years, this time merging with &lt;a href=\"SKS%20Stoczniowiec%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Polonia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Lechia-Polonia%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; taking Polonia's place in the 2nd division. This merger lasted 3 years, with the team's fortunes slowly deteriorating, finishing 7th in 1998\u201399, 14th in 1999\u20132000, and 19th in the 2000\u201301 season, and thus suffering another relegation to the 3rd division. In the 2001\u201302 season Lechia\u2013Polonia competed in the 3rd division, while a newly formed Lechia Gda\u0144sk team was formed in the 6th division. After the 2001\u201302 season Lechia\u2013Polonia dissolved, resulting newly formed Lechia becoming the continuation of the original club, while Polonia Gda\u0144sk having already reformed in the sixth tier in 1999.\nRe-formation and re-start from the sixth tier (2001\u20132008).\nThe newly formed independent Lechia Gda\u0144sk team had a lot of initial success, winning the league in its first year in the 6th tier in 2001\u201302 season. This form continued finishing first in the 2002\u201303 season in the 5th tier, as well as winning the 2003\u201304 season in the 4th tier, and also finishing first the season after in the 2004\u201305 3rd tier. After 4 seasons of being an independent club after failed mergers with Olimpia and Polonia, Lechia found itself back in the second tier of Polish football.\nBack in the II liga Lechia finished the 2005\u201306 in 10th, comfortably above the automatic relegation zone, and clear of the relegation playoffs. With Lechia making more improvements during the 2006\u201307 season finishing in 5th.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20II%20liga%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season was the team's 20th season outside of the top flight, having to come from two failed mergers, and working their way back into the 2nd division. During the season the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84skiego%20O%C5%9Brodka%20Sportu\"&gt;MOSiR Stadium&lt;/a&gt; became a fortress, with Lechia winning 14 of the 17 games at home, losing only once at home, against &lt;a href=\"Odra%20Opole\"&gt;Odra Opole&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia struggled more away from home, winning 6 of their 17 away games. Lechia was helped during the season with goal-scoring contributions from &lt;a href=\"Maciej%20Rogalski\"&gt;Maciej Rogalski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pawe%C5%82%20Buza%C5%82a\"&gt;Pawe\u0142 Buza\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Piotr%20Cetnarowicz\"&gt;Piotr Cetnarowicz&lt;/a&gt;, with all three players scoring more than 10 goals over the course of the season. Despite the club's decent away form, it proved by the end of the season that their home form had massively helped Lechia in the league, with Lechia finishing the 2007\u201308 season as champions, and as a result, secured promotion back to the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to the Ekstraklasa (2008\u20132018).\nFor the 2008\u201309 season Lechia returned to the Ekstraklasa for the first time since being relegated after the &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1987\u201388 Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; season. Lechia struggled in their first season of being back in the top flight of Polish football with the team losing 16 of the 30 games that season. They ended the season three points above the relegation zone, and stayed in the league mostly due to their home form (having 7 of their 9 wins that season from their home games). Lechia fared better during the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; season finishing in eighth, while also enjoying a cup run that took the team to the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;2009\u201310 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt; losing in the semi-final to eventual cup winners &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bialystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2009 the members of Lechia Gda\u0144sk (OSP) signed a document forming Lechia Gdansk S.A. (Sp\u00f3\u0142ka Akcyjna = Stock Corporation). It was during this season that Gdansk was chosen to be one of the host cities of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt; championships in Poland and Ukraine, meaning the team would be moving from their current &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84skiego%20O%C5%9Brodka%20Sportu\"&gt;MOSiR Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to a new 43,000 capacity stadium in 2011.\nIn Lechia's 3rd season back in the top flight, it was another season of consolidating their Ekstraklasa status. In the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2010\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt; the team once again finished in 8th place. It was, however, a more positive season that showed progression for the team as a whole. It was the first time since their promotion back to the top league that Lechia had won more games than they had lost, finished with a positive goal difference, and Lechia player &lt;a href=\"Abdou%20Razack%20Traor%C3%A9\"&gt;Abdou Traor\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; finished joint runner up for most goals that season. And for the second season in a row Lechia reached the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;2010\u201311 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before losing 5\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia&lt;/a&gt; over the two legs. This was the last season in which Lechia played at the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84skiego%20O%C5%9Brodka%20Sportu\"&gt;MOSiR Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the stadium in which Lechia had played all of their home games since their formation in 1945. The last game to be played at the stadium was the final game of the season against &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt;, a game in which Lechia lost 2\u20131.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt; season saw Lechia move into their &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Energa%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;new stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the first game to be played there saw Lechia playing against &lt;a href=\"KS%20Cracovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;Cracovia&lt;/a&gt;, a game which finished 1\u20131. Lechia struggled during their first season inside the new and much larger stadium, winning only three of their home games that season. Lechia slumped to a 13th-place finish, in a season where they scored 21 goals in 30 games.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2012\u201313&lt;/a&gt; there were more positives for Lechia, again finishing in a mid-table 8th. The team once again struggled at home, winning only three games. With the relegation of &lt;a href=\"Polonia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Polonia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; (who finished the season in sixth) due to financial issues, Lechia effectively finished seventh, and secured their highest finish since their return to the top flight.\nThere were major changes made for the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2013\u201314 Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; season with the introduction of a Championship Round (teams who finish 1st\u20138th) and a Relegation Round (teams who finish 9th\u201316th). This took the overall games played in a season from 30 to 37. As ever Lechia finished eighth after the 30-game season qualifying for the Championship Round. Lechia finished the first-ever Championship Round in fourth place and just missing out on qualification for the qualifying rounds of the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Zawisza%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Zawisza Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; winning the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;2013\u201314 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The 4th-place finish meant that Lechia had achieved their highest finish since the &lt;a href=\"1956%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt; season, in which Lechia finished third.\n&lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; saw Lechia struggling towards the lower end of the table by the time the winter break took place. During the mid-season transfer window &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Mila\"&gt;Sebastian Mila&lt;/a&gt; rejoined the club where he had started his professional career 14 years earlier. The Polish international became Lechia's captain for the remainder of the season, and helped the club to an eighth-placed finish for the regular season. During the Championship Round, Lechia managed to finish in fifth, once again just missing out on qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2015\u201316&lt;/a&gt; saw an intent for progression for Lechia. Joining &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Mila\"&gt;Mila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20%C5%81ukasik\"&gt;\u0141ukasik&lt;/a&gt;, the Poland internationals who were already at the club, saw the arrivals of &lt;a href=\"Ariel%20Borysiuk\"&gt;Ariel Borysiuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82awomir%20Peszko\"&gt;S\u0142awomir Peszko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Wawrzyniak\"&gt;Jakub Wawrzyniak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grzegorz%20Wojtkowiak\"&gt;Grzegorz Wojtkowiak&lt;/a&gt;, as well as former Serbian international &lt;a href=\"Milo%C5%A1%20Krasi%C4%87\"&gt;Milo\u0161 Krasi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the new players Lechia struggled at the start of the season and hovered above the relegation zone until the winter break. The team managed to reach seventh place by the end of the regular season. During the Championship Round Lechia once again finished fifth, and narrowly missed out on qualification for the Europa League Qualifiers. &lt;a href=\"Grzegorz%20Ku%C5%9Bwik\"&gt;Grzegorz Ku\u015bwik&lt;/a&gt; who joined Lechia from &lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w\"&gt;Ruch&lt;/a&gt; during the summer finished the season with 11 goals, and was one of the top goal scorers that season.\n&lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt; saw the improvements that fans had been anticipating. With players such as &lt;a href=\"Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Harasl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Harasl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; as well as the internationally experienced players who joined the season before had now settled into the club. New arrivals such as twins &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Marco Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Rafa%C5%82%20Wolski\"&gt;Rafa\u0142 Wolski&lt;/a&gt; arriving from &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Du%C5%A1an%20Kuciak\"&gt;Du\u0161an Kuciak&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;. The regular season saw Lechia winning all but three of their home games, and were top of the table at the end of 10 of the game weeks. Lechia ended the regular season in fourth. In the last home game of the season against &lt;a href=\"Pogo%C5%84%20Szczecin\"&gt;Pogo\u0144&lt;/a&gt; Lechia celebrated the careers of &lt;a href=\"Piotr%20Wi%C5%9Bniewski\"&gt;Piotr Wi\u015bniewski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mateusz%20B%C4%85k\"&gt;Mateusz B\u0105k&lt;/a&gt;. Both players had played over 10 years for Lechia, while Lechia was the only professional club Wi\u015bniewski played for. Both players came on as substitutes in the 4\u20130 win over Pogon, with Wi\u015bniewski scoring the final goal of the game, and B\u0105k made an important save to keep a clean sheet for the team. Going into the final game of the season Lechia was in fourth place, two points behind &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia&lt;/a&gt; who were top, Lechia knew that with a win away to Legia they had a great chance of winning their first-ever Ekstraklasa title. The game finished 0\u20130, and due to &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia&lt;/a&gt; drawing with each other, Lechia did not gain any positions and finished fourth with the same points as Lech and Jaga who finished in second and third. For the third season in a row Lechia once again missed out on qualification for the Europa League by a single position, this time due to their main rivals &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; getting the place from winning the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;2016\u201317 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Marco Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; finished the season as the top scorer in the league with 18 goals, an award which was jointly shared with &lt;a href=\"Marcin%20Robak\"&gt;Marcin Robak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was much anticipation for the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20season\"&gt;2017\u201318&lt;/a&gt; season after having the chance to win the title up until the final game the season before. However, any optimism of a repeat was short-lived. Lechia spent most of the season in the bottom half of the table and finished the regular season in 14th, one place and one point above the relegation zone. This was the first season Lechia had featured in the Relegation Round. Wins against &lt;a href=\"Bruk-Bet%20Termalica%20Nieciecza\"&gt;Termalica Nieciecza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt; ensured that Lechia finished the Relegation Round in 13th place, two places and three points above the relegation zone. &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio&lt;/a&gt; had a huge contribution to Lechia staying up, with 16 goals from Marco and 10 for Fl\u00e1vio. At the end of the season &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Mila\"&gt;Sebastian Mila&lt;/a&gt; retired from football, after having had two spells with Lechia.\nStokowiec and new success (2018\u20132021).\n&lt;a href=\"Piotr%20Stokowiec\"&gt;Piotr Stokowiec&lt;/a&gt; was in place for the final few games of the disappointing 2017\u201318 season and was in place ready for the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2018\u201319 Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; season. The first game of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20season\"&gt;2018-19 season&lt;/a&gt; saw Lechia beating &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82awomir%20Peszko\"&gt;S\u0142awomir Peszko&lt;/a&gt; receiving a straight red. After the game Peszko received a three-month ban for a dangerous kick at &lt;a href=\"Arvydas%20Novikovas\"&gt;Arvydas Novikovas&lt;/a&gt;. The season started well, with Lechia winning five of their first seven games, while also holding Legia to draw in Warsaw. Lechia's first defeat of the season came away to &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; after the international break, before losing a 3\u20130 lead and drawing 3\u20133 with &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt; in the game after. After a difficult September, Lechia went on a 13-game unbeaten run, including wins over rivals &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; and beating &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; away in Pozna\u0144 for the first time in 52 years. The unbeaten run lead to Lechia leading the Ekstraklasa when the league broke up for the winter break. During this time Lechia also went on a cup run beating &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CWKS%20Resovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;Resovia Rzeszow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruk-Bet%20Termalica%20Nieciecza\"&gt;Bruk-Bet Termalica Nieciecza&lt;/a&gt; to reach the quarterfinals. After the break Lechia continued their good form losing only 2 of the 11 games after the restart. After losing the final game of the regular season to &lt;a href=\"KS%20Cracovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;Cracovia&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20132, they found themselves in the first place due to goal difference, having +3 goals more than &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia's good fortunes in the cup also continued after the restart, beating &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik Zabrze&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals, &lt;a href=\"Rak%C3%B3w%20Cz%C4%99stochowa\"&gt;Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa&lt;/a&gt; in the semifinal, meeting &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt; in the final. The final was played on 2 May 2019 at the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Narodowy\"&gt;National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw. After a close game &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; scored for Lechia in the 85th minute, before it was disallowed by the &lt;a href=\"Video%20assistant%20referee\"&gt;VAR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Artur%20Sobiech\"&gt;Artur Sobiech&lt;/a&gt; scored the winning goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time, winning the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt; for Lechia, the second time in their history they won the competition. After the cup triumph, the championship group was a disappointment in comparison. After losing only four games in the previous 30, Lechia lost four of the seven championship games. Despite the disappointing end, it was a historic campaign for Lechia after winning the Polish Cup for the second time, and finishing third in the league, their joint highest finish in the league which was last achieved in 1956.\nLechia started the season with the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;2019 Polish SuperCup&lt;/a&gt; playing against Polish Champions &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt;. Two goals from &lt;a href=\"Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Harasl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Luk\u00e1\u0161 Harasl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href=\"Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kubicki\"&gt;Jaros\u0142aw Kubicki&lt;/a&gt; meant that Lechia were 3-0 up in the final before a late consolation for Piast from &lt;a href=\"Patryk%20Soko%C5%82owski\"&gt;Patryk Soko\u0142owski&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia won the Polish SuperCup for the second time in their history by winning 3\u20131. Another challenge for Lechia to face early in the season was playing in a European competition for only the second time in their history. Lechia were to play in the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, with the team being drawn against &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF\"&gt;Br\u00f8ndby IF&lt;/a&gt;. The first game went well, with Lechia winning 2\u20131 at home, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patryk%20Lipski\"&gt;Patryk Lipski&lt;/a&gt;. The second leg however went Br\u00f8ndby's way. After finishing the away leg 2\u20131, with Lechia's goal coming from Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o, the game went to extra time. Br\u00f8ndby scored early in extra time, and with Lechia pushing for an equalizer, scored again late on meaning Lechia lost the tie 5\u20133 on aggregate. The start of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20season\"&gt;2019\u201320&lt;/a&gt; season proved to be difficult for Lechia, with new signing &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDarko%20Udovi%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;\u017darko Udovi\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt; receiving a four match ban after being sent off in the team's first game of the season against &lt;a href=\"%C5%81KS%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia went on to only win one of their first six games, which was against &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20P%C5%82ock\"&gt;Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock&lt;/a&gt;. After the difficult start Lechia then went on a five match winning run which put them top of the league after beating &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; away 2\u20131. After their winning run was ended by &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt;, the team had the &lt;a href=\"Tricity%20Derby\"&gt;Tricity Derby&lt;/a&gt; the following game. After goals from &lt;a href=\"Artur%20Sobiech\"&gt;Artur Sobiech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; (this being Paix\u00e3o's seventh goal against Arka, making him the outright highest scorer in the fixture) Lechia lost a 2\u20130 lead and finished the game 2\u20132, with Udovi\u010di\u0107 again being sent off, this time receiving a two-month ban. After the game against Arka, Lechia failed to win any of the next three games, losing two, placing the team in 9th place at the mid-way point of the regular season. For the start of the second round of fixtures Lechia beat &lt;a href=\"%C5%81KS%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131, with Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o scoring two goals. These two goals put Paix\u00e3o on 68 goals in the Ekstraklasa, overtaking &lt;a href=\"Miroslav%20Radovi%C4%87\"&gt;Miroslav Radovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; as the highest scoring foreigner in the top league of Poland. Lechia went on to win the next two games while managing to keep clean sheets in both games. The 3 match winning run was ended after a 3\u20130 defeat against Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok. It was announced a few days after the game, on 17 December, that the players and staff had not been played by the club since September and had failed to pay the players their bonuses for winning the Polish Cup in May. Due to the players having not been paid for months they would have been legally be able to apply for a termination of their contract, and leading to the possibility of many important players leaving during the next transfer window. After the finances had been resolved, Lechia lost the final game of the autumn round 3-0 going into the winter break in 7th. To help with the club's future financial situation key players on high wagers were told they could leave during the winter break. Key players that left included; &lt;a href=\"Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Harasl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Luk\u00e1\u0161 Harasl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artur%20Sobiech\"&gt;Artur Sobiech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20%C5%81ukasik\"&gt;Daniel \u0141ukasik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rafa%C5%82%20Wolski\"&gt;Rafa\u0142 Wolski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82awomir%20Peszko\"&gt;S\u0142awomir Peszko&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"B%C5%82a%C5%BCej%20Augustyn\"&gt;B\u0142a\u017cej Augustyn&lt;/a&gt; training with the Lechia II team until arrangements could be made. Although key players were missing and there being a greater emphasis on playing the youth players in the first game back after the winter break, the team started the second half of the season drawing 2\u20132 with a Championship chasing &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; team. During the game it was clear to see the club's current situation with their finances with the entire bench being made up of teenagers from the U23's team. Lechia won the following game 1\u20130 against Piast with &lt;a href=\"Kacper%20Urba%C5%84ski\"&gt;Kacper Urba\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt; starting the game, becoming the youngest ever Lechia player to start a competitive game, and the youngest ever player to start a game in the Ekstraklasa. On 10 March it was announced that all games would be played behind closed doors due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. After the announcement Polish football would be played without fans present, Lechia went on to beat &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in an empty stadium in the Polish Cup to reach the semi-finals, leaving only 2 wins to retain the cup. Announcements were made over the following days and weeks, with the Ekstralasa, I liga and Polish Cup fixtures all being suspended until 26 April at the earliest. At the time of the league's suspension Lechia were in 7th place with 4 games left to play in the regular season. After a difficult restart to the season Lechia went on a run to climb the table, including a 4\u20133 win over rivals Arka Gdynia. This run coincided with the meeting of &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; in the Polish Cup semi-final, against whom Lechia beat 4\u20133 in penalties after the game finished 1\u20131. This led Lechia into their second Polish Cup final in successive years. Lechia finished the season in 4th place and played &lt;a href=\"KS%20Cracovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;Cracovia&lt;/a&gt; in the Polish Cup final, losing the final 3\u20132 after the game went into extra-time.\nLechia went into the 2020\u201321 season celebrating their 75th anniversary, but with the fans and team knowing they had lost some key players from previous seasons. &lt;a href=\"Filip%20Mladenovi%C4%87\"&gt;Filip Mladenovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; joined rivals Legia Warsaw while &lt;a href=\"Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Harasl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Luk\u00e1\u0161 Harasl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; made the permanent move to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Sassuolo%20Calcio\"&gt;U.S. Sassuolo&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia struggled at the start of the season, losing two of their first three games, before finding some form and moving to a high of 4th place. The effects of the coronavirus were again felt by the team, with the match against &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; being postponed due to an outbreak in the Wis\u0142a team. Lechia eventually struggled with a Covid outbreak of their own, with &lt;a href=\"Jaroslav%20Mihal%C3%ADk\"&gt;Jaroslav Mihal\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; being the first confirmed case in the club on 10th October, getting the virus while on international duty. In early November the club had an outbreak affecting 13 players and 7 members of the coaching staff. After a month with no games due to the teams outbreak the Lechia team returned to play \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, winning the game 3\u20132. After this initial success after the teams isolation, Lechia lost the following four games without scoring a goal. Going into the final game before the winter break the team found themselves in the bottom half of the table, but a 3\u20130 win over Cracovia helped them to rise up to 8th. After the winter break Lechia's poor form returned with defeats to Jagiellonia in the league and &lt;a href=\"Puszcza%20Niepo%C5%82omice\"&gt;Puszcza Niepo\u0142omice&lt;/a&gt; in the Polish Cup, with some fans questioning the role of Stokowiec as the teams manager. After a poor run of results which saw 6 defeats in 7 games, Lechia picked up form and gained some momentum in the league, winning 5 of the next 8 games, losing only one, and mounting a threat to the top three places in the league. After this run Lechia's form once again dropped, winning only 6 points from the final 7 games of the season. The team went into the final game of the season knowing that a win would be enough to secure European football for the following season, but a defeat to Jagiellonia on the final day of the season saw the side slump to a disappointing 7th place finish.\nCurrent era (2021\u2013).\nThe 2021\u201322 season saw changes in the league structure, increasing the teams from 16 to 18 and scrapping the championship and relegation leagues at the end of the season, seeing all teams playing 34 league games a season instead of the previous 37. The 2021\u201322 season started relatively well for Lechia losing only one of their first six games and securing 9 points in the process. Lechia dropped points against &lt;a href=\"Radomiak%20Radom\"&gt;Radomiak Radom&lt;/a&gt; in their sixth game of the season after having been 2\u20130 up to draw the game 2\u20132. While the season looked more promising, and they play from the squad looked better than the previous season, this kind of collapse in Lechia games was becoming too common under Stokowiec's rein. Shortly after the game with Radomiak it was announced that Piotr Stokowiec had officially left the club, Stokowiec being Lechia's second longest serving manager in the clubs history. On 1 September 2021 it was announced that the Pogo\u0144 Szczecin assistant manager &lt;a href=\"Tomasz%20Kaczmarek\"&gt;Tomasz Kaczmarek&lt;/a&gt; was to become the new Lechia manager. Lechia under Kaczmarek initially performed well in the league, going on a nine game unbeaten run in the league under the manager, a run of 10 games in total with Stokowiec's last game in charge being included. This run of games saw Lechia convincingly beating teams, with convincing wins against &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20%C5%81%C4%99czna\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik \u0141\u0119czna&lt;/a&gt; and the current Polish champions, &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. The run saw Lechia closing in on the leaders Lech, often fighting with Rak\u00f3w for the second and third places. The impressive run came to a disappointing end with a 5\u20131 defeat to Pomeranian rivals Pogo\u0144. The defeat saw Lechia's run of form drastically change, going on to lose 3 of the next 4 games, and being in 5th place in the league as the Ekstraklasa stopped for the winter break.\nThe fans.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk is the most supported club in northern Poland, and is one of the most supported clubs in the country, despite not always being successful. Most of the support comes from &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pomeranian&lt;/a&gt; region. The biggest supporters group is the \"Lions of the North\" group () who organise displays in the stadium as well as travel to away games. Outside of Gda\u0144sk the club have 24 official fan groups linked to the club, with more unofficial fan groups. The official and unofficial fan groups can be found in the towns of; &lt;a href=\"Braniewo\"&gt;Braniewo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Byt%C3%B3w\"&gt;Byt\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chojnice\"&gt;Chojnice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czersk\"&gt;Czersk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dzierzgo%C5%84\"&gt;Dzierzgo\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frombork\"&gt;Frombork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gniew\"&gt;Gniew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kartuzy\"&gt;Kartuzy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%9Bcierzyna\"&gt;Ko\u015bcierzyna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kwidzyn\"&gt;Kwidzyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C4%99bork\"&gt;L\u0119bork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malbork\"&gt;Malbork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C5%82awa\"&gt;M\u0142awa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mi%C5%82ob%C4%85dz\"&gt;Mi\u0142ob\u0105dz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nowe\"&gt;Nowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nowy%20Dw%C3%B3r%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nowy%20Staw\"&gt;Nowy Staw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nowy%20Targ\"&gt;Nowy Targ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelplin\"&gt;Pelplin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pisz\"&gt;Pisz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pruszcz%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;Pruszcz Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prabuty\"&gt;Prabuty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Przodkowo\"&gt;Przodkowo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pszcz%C3%B3%C5%82ki%2C%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pszcz\u00f3\u0142ki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rumia\"&gt;Rumia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sierakowice%2C%20Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Sierakowice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skarszewy\"&gt;Skarszewy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%B3rcz\"&gt;Sk\u00f3rcz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sm%C4%99towo%20Chmiele%C5%84skie\"&gt;Sm\u0119towo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sopot\"&gt;Sopot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Starogard%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;Starogard Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sztum\"&gt;Sztum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tczew\"&gt;Tczew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuchom\"&gt;Tuchom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ustka\"&gt;Ustka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82awowo\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142awowo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wejherowo\"&gt;Wejherowo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zblewo\"&gt;Zblewo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C5%BBukowo\"&gt;\u017bukowo&lt;/a&gt;, with the club also having a fan group in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1980s many of the club's fans were active in the &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; movement which was fighting the communist regime in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. This included &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt;, a fan of Lechia Gda\u0144sk who was at the front of the Solidarity movement and became the first elected &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Poland\"&gt;President of Poland&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of communism. Due to Gda\u0144sk's role with the Solidarity movement, it is not unusual to see anti-communist slogans on banners in the stadium. A phrase often used by the club and the fans is \"We're creating history\" (), which can be associated to the role Lechia fans have had on the fall of communism in Poland, and with the club's increasing competitiveness in recent years, such as winning the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;Polish SuperCup&lt;/a&gt; and finishing third in the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; all in 2019.\nFamous Lechia fans include; &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity trade union&lt;/a&gt; which helped to bring an end to communist rule in Poland and Poland's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Poland\"&gt;second President&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Tusk\"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt;, former Polish prime minister and &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20European%20Council\"&gt;President of the European Council&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 to 2019 is also a Lechia fan. &lt;a href=\"Pawe%C5%82%20Adamowicz\"&gt;Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;mayor of Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; from 1998\u20132019 until his assassination in 2019, was a life Lechia fan. He used his role as mayor of the city to help the club during its reformation in 2001.\nFriendships.\nCurrent friendships.\nThe fans have a friendship with &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; with which the two clubs fans have had a friendship since 1977, and have had friendly relations since 1967. This is the oldest fan friendship in Polish football. During the 2017/18 season, the two sets of fans celebrated their 40th Friendship Anniversary. Games between the two are often called \"\"&lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20%26amp%3B%20%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw%20%28Fan%20Friendship%29\"&gt;The Friendship Match&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nThere is also a mutual friendship between fans of &lt;a href=\"Gryf%20S%C5%82upsk\"&gt;Gryf S\u0142upsk&lt;/a&gt; and Lechia Gda\u0144sk. Gryf S\u0142upsk are also from the &lt;a href=\"Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pomeranian&lt;/a&gt; area of Poland. The two teams have rarely met competitively due to Gryf often playing in the lower regional divisions. Gryf set up the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Cup%20Tournament\"&gt;Amber Cup Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, an indoor football tournament which takes place during the winter break. Gryf S\u0142upsk hosted the tournament and have featured many times, winning in 2009, before the tournament was moved to Gda\u0144sk due to the rise in popularity, and was hosted by Lechia Gda\u0144sk from 2016 to 2018.\nThere are many other teams in the &lt;a href=\"Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pomeranian province&lt;/a&gt; which have friendly relations with Lechia or have sympathies towards the team. The &lt;a href=\"Tricity%20Derby\"&gt;Tricity Derby&lt;/a&gt; which is contested by the two biggest teams in the Pomeranian area has split the teams in the region with many fans backing Lechia in the derby. These are generally fans from; &lt;a href=\"Chojniczanka%20Chojnice\"&gt;Chojniczanka Chojnice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bytovia%20Byt%C3%B3w\"&gt;Bytovia Byt\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cartusia%20Kartuzy\"&gt;Cartusia Kartuzy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czarni%20Pruszcz%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;Czarni Pruszcz Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KP%20Starogard%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;KP Starogard Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unia%20Tczew\"&gt;Unia Tczew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pomezania%20Malbork\"&gt;Pomezania Malbork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rod%C5%82o%20Kwidzyn\"&gt;Rod\u0142o Kwidzyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olimpia%20Sztum\"&gt;Olimpia Sztum&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther teams' fans who have friendly relations with Lechia include; &lt;a href=\"Jeziorak%20I%C5%82awa\"&gt;Jeziorak I\u0142awa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mied%C5%BA%20Legnica\"&gt;Mied\u017a Legnica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hutnik%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Hutnik Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C5%82awianka%20M%C5%82awa\"&gt;M\u0142awianka M\u0142awa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"SFC%20Opava\"&gt;SFC Opava&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being a basketball team, &lt;a href=\"Czarni%20S%C5%82upsk\"&gt;Czarni S\u0142upsk&lt;/a&gt; fans are also closely linked with Lechia fans.\nWhile not a friendship, Lechia fans have had an \u201cagreement\u201d () with &lt;a href=\"Stomil%20Olsztyn%20%28football%29\"&gt;Stomil Olsztyn&lt;/a&gt; since 2016. Typically if agreements last the two teams become friends and develop a \u201cfriendship\u201d (). Lechia fans supposedly also have an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Rak%C3%B3w%20Cz%C4%99stochowa\"&gt;Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer friendships.\nFrom 1983 until 1988 Lechia was part of a fan coalition which consisted of &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w\"&gt;Ruch Chorz\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, being the biggest coalition in Poland at the time. The coalition broke up when Lechia fans wanted &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; to join the coalition, but opposition from Widzew, Jagiellonia and Ruch prevented the coalition from growing. As a result, the coalition split with Lechia and Wis\u0142a fans siding with \u015al\u0105sk.\nLechia fans had an agreement with Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w dating back to 1973, and from 1988 until 2016 both sets of fans were involved in a fan coalition with \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw. Wis\u0142a left the \"Three Kings of Great Cities\" () coalition to join a new coalition of Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Ruch Chorz\u00f3w. This upset both Lechia and \u015al\u0105sk fans as fans of &lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w\"&gt;Ruch Chorz\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt; were involved in the murder of a \u015al\u0105sk fan in 2003. The main Lechia Gda\u0144sk fan group posted that the decision for Wis\u0142a to form a friendship with Ruch was unacceptable for the fans of Lechia, and that the friendship was to be terminated. The main \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw fan group posted a similar response the following day officially ending the TKWM alliance.\nWhile not technically a former friendship it was also documented that Lechia fans had agreements with both &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20P%C5%82ock\"&gt;Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock&lt;/a&gt; since at least 2017 until around 2020. While this agreement didn't progress into a friendship between fans, it is unlikely that there will be negative thoughts between each team's fans, as with the case of Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w, and have a more neutral opinion of each other.\nRivals.\nTheir biggest rivals are &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;, the games between the two are known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Tricity%20derby\"&gt;Tricity derby&lt;/a&gt;\" (). The two teams are the largest in the Tricity area, with Lechia representing &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; and Arka representing &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;, these are the two largest cities in the Tricity area. The Tricity derby impacts the &lt;a href=\"Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Pomeranian&lt;/a&gt; region as a whole as fans of the smaller clubs in the region will also sympathise with either Arka or Lechia, with some counties being fully behind one of the teams with other counties being split between the two. Lechia receives the greatest support outside of Gda\u0144sk from &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82upsk\"&gt;S\u0142upsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Starogard%20Gda%C5%84ski\"&gt;Starogard Gda\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chojnice\"&gt;Chojnice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malbork\"&gt;Malbork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sopot\"&gt;Sopot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"L%C4%99bork\"&gt;L\u0119bork&lt;/a&gt;. Arka receives most of its support outside of Gdynia from &lt;a href=\"Tczew\"&gt;Tczew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wejherowo\"&gt;Wejherowo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rumia\"&gt;Rumia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%9Bcierzyna\"&gt;Ko\u015bcierzyna&lt;/a&gt;. Lechia has the most success in the derby winning 16 to Arka's 11, with Lechia also being undefeated to Arka in the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; (10 wins, 4 draws).\n&lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"KS%20Cracovia%20%28football%29\"&gt;Cracovia&lt;/a&gt; are rivals dating back to the time with their alliance with Wis\u0142a. This was due to the two largest fan coalitions in Poland, \"Three Kings of Great Cities\" (Lechia, \u015al\u0105sk, and Wis\u0142a) and \"The Great Triad\" (Arka, Cracovia, and Lech) with any of the opposite coalition teams playing each other resulting in a big and hotly contested match.\nIn recent years there has been a growing rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;. While Legia have often been challenging for titles and trophies for much of their history, Lechia have not. While Lechia has been more competitive in recent years, and are finishing higher in the table, the matches between the two sides is starting to have more importance, with the Lechia home game against Legia often being one of the highest attended games of the season.\nOther clubs whose fans have negative views of Lechia are; &lt;a href=\"Pogo%C5%84%20Szczecin\"&gt;Pogo\u0144 Szczecin&lt;/a&gt; (due to both clubs being from Northern regions in Poland, where historically there have been few competitive football clubs), &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt; (due to Zag\u0142\u0119bie being the main rivals of \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, Lechia's biggest friendship), &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w\"&gt;Ruch Chorz\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Lublin\"&gt;Motor Lublin&lt;/a&gt; (despite Motor fans having a friendship with \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw), &lt;a href=\"GKS%20Katowice\"&gt;GKS Katowice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zawisza%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Zawisza Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elana%20Toru%C5%84\"&gt;Elana Toru\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polonia%20Bytom\"&gt;Polonia Bytom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik Zabrze&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2016 Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w has since turned into a rivalry for some fans, while other fans still see the club in a more positive light.\n&lt;a href=\"Ba%C5%82tyk%20Gdynia\"&gt;Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; is another rivalry due to the geographically close proximity between the two clubs. Over recent years, however, this fixture hasn't been much of a rivalry due to the teams being in different divisions for many seasons. This rivalry was at its biggest in the 1990s when the two clubs played each other often in the second tier.\n&lt;a href=\"Gedania%201922%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gedania Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SKS%20Stoczniowiec%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stoczniowiec Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; have historically been a derby for Lechia with games between any of the three teams being known as the &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk%20Derby\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk Derby&lt;/a&gt; (). The rivalry with Gedania was at its biggest in the 1940s and 1950s while the rivalry with Polonia was at its height from the late 1960s to early 1980s. Due to the current leagues, the teams are in, this is no longer seen as a major rivalry.\nWhile not rivals per se with any of these teams in a competitive capacity, these local teams fans are all aligned with Arka for the Tricity derby and are, as such seen in lower regard compared to other local teams; &lt;a href=\"Gwardia%20Koszalin\"&gt;Gwardia Koszalin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaszubia%20Ko%C5%9Bcierzyna\"&gt;Kaszubia Ko\u015bcierzyna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gryf%20Wejherowo\"&gt;Gryf Wejherowo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Tczew\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Tczew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orkan%20Rumia\"&gt;Orkan Rumia&lt;/a&gt;.\nTricity derby.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tricity%20derby\"&gt;Tricity derby&lt;/a&gt; is a match between Lechia and &lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;. The first derby was held on 2 September 1964 and was a 2\u20131 win for Lechia Gda\u0144sk.\nGda\u0144sk derby.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk%20Derby\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk Derby&lt;/a&gt; are games between teams based in &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;. Historically the derby has referred to games between Lechia Gda\u0144sk, &lt;a href=\"Gedania%201922%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gedania Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SKS%20Stoczniowiec%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stoczniowiec Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first derby held between Lechia and Gedania Gda\u0144sk was held on 23 September 1945 and was a 7\u20132 win for Lechia Gda\u0144sk. The last time this derby was played was on 27 June 2004.\nThe first derby held between Lechia and Stoczniowiec Gda\u0144sk was held on 20 August 1967 and was a 2\u20131 win for Stoczniowiec Gda\u0144sk. The last time this derby was played was on 7 May 1983.\nStadia.\nStadion Gda\u0144sk.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Polsat Plus Arena Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, previously called the \"Baltic Arena\", \"PGE Arena Gda\u0144sk\" (2010 \u2013 2015), \"Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk\" (2015 \u2013 2020) is the home &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; of Lechia Gda\u0144sk. The stadium is located on ul. Pokole\u0144 Lechii Gda\u0144sk (\"Generations of Lechia Gda\u0144sk street\") in the northern part of the city (Letnica district). The capacity of the stands is 41,620 spectators, all seated and roofed. Stadion Gda\u0144sk is the largest arena in Ekstraklasa and the third largest in the country (after National Stadium and Silesia Stadium).\nConstruction of the stadium started in 2008 and was completed mid-2011. The opening match was between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and Cracovia and ended with 1\u20131 draw. The first international match, Poland \u2013 Germany, took place on 6 September 2011 and ended 2\u20132. The match was relocated from Warsaw because the National Stadium was not ready. Stadion Gda\u0144sk is used by Lechia Gda\u0144sk since 'the White-and-Green' relocated there from &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84skiego%20O%C5%9Brodka%20Sportu\"&gt;MOSiR Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium was also one of the designated venues for the finals of Euro 2012. It hosted four matches during the tournament. Three matches in Group C and one quarter-final were played here. In 2010 the official name of the stadium changed to PGE Arena Gda\u0144sk, on the basis of a sponsorship agreement with Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE Group). The contract with PGE ended, however, on 30 September 2015, after PGE chose not to renew the contract. On 9 November 2015 &lt;a href=\"Energa%20SA\"&gt;Energa&lt;/a&gt; was revealed as the new stadium's sponsor until 30 November 2020. On 21 May 2021 stadium's management signed a sponsorship agreement with &lt;a href=\"Polsat\"&gt;Polsat&lt;/a&gt; TV broadcaster. The stadium hosted the &lt;a href=\"2021%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2021 UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Gda\u0144sk Stadium\" due to UEFA sponsorship regulations.\nMOSiR Stadium / Gda\u0144sk Sports Center Stadium.\nThe Lechia Gda\u0144sk stadium from 1945 to 2011 was the MOSiR Stadium. In 2000 the ownership of the stadium changed from MOSiR to Gda\u0144sk Sports Center, also seeing a change in the stadiums name. Now it now officially known as \"Gda\u0144sk Sports Center Stadium\", the \"Lechia Gda\u0144sk Stadion\" or simply the \"Lechia Stadion\" but has often been called by Lechia fans, \"Traugutta\" or \"Traugutta 29\", the street and address of the stadium. The stadium is most well known for the European Cup game against &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; where around 40,000 fans attended the game, just over three times more than the capacity of 12,244. Since Lechia moved to the Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk the stadium has been used for first team training, matches for the &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20Ladies%20%28football%29\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk Ladies&lt;/a&gt; team, the &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20II%20and%20Lechia%27s%20Academy\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk II&lt;/a&gt; team, and formerly also held games for the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk rugby&lt;/a&gt; team.\nAvenue of Stars.\nAt the MOSiR Stadium Lechia have an \"Avenue of Stars\" which commemorates the efforts and success of former players and coaches. There are currently 21 players with stars at the stadium, including all-time top goalscorer, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rogocz\"&gt;Roman Rogocz&lt;/a&gt;, and all-time appearance maker, &lt;a href=\"Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Puszkarz\"&gt;Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz&lt;/a&gt;. Due to MOSiR becoming the training ground in 2011 after the move to the PGE Arena Gda\u0144sk there have been calls for the stars to be moved due to the new stadium by some fans, while others see the stadium as the historic home of Lechia Gda\u0144sk and the perfect place to keep the players' commemorative stars.\nThe players who have a star to commemorate their time with Lechia Gda\u0144sk are &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Apolewicz\"&gt;Jerzy Apolewicz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micha%C5%82%20Globisz\"&gt;Micha\u0142 Globisz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20G%C5%82adysz\"&gt;J\u00f3zef G\u0142adysz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrzej%20G%C5%82ownia\"&gt;Andrzej G\u0142ownia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Gronowski\"&gt;Henryk Gronowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gronowski\"&gt;Robert Gronowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Jastrz%C4%99bowski\"&gt;Jerzy Jastrz\u0119bowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogus%C5%82aw%20Kaczmarek\"&gt;Bogus\u0142aw Kaczmarek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Kokot\"&gt;Alfred Kokot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Kokot\"&gt;Henryk Kokot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Korynt\"&gt;Roman Korynt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Kruszczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jerzy Kruszczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Kulwicki\"&gt;Lech Kulwicki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Kusz\"&gt;Hubert Kusz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Musia%C5%82\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142aw Musia\u0142&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryszard%20Polak\"&gt;Ryszard Polak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Puszkarz\"&gt;Zdzis\u0142aw Puszkarz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrzej%20Salach\"&gt;Andrzej Salach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Smug\"&gt;Jakub Smug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rogocz\"&gt;Roman Rogocz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zbigniew%20%C5%BBemojtel\"&gt;Zbigniew \u017bemojtel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttendance.\nAttendance statistics since the start of the 2011\u201312 season after the club moved to the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Energa%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u2020Season still in progress.\nColours, badges and banners.\nKit history.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk's colours have always been green and white. In the first years of the club, Lechia wore green shirts with white shorts and either green or white socks. Predominantly throughout Lechias history the team has worn all green shirts, however, there were a few seasons in which Lechia wore white as their home colours. During the 1960\u201361 season, Lechia wore green and white stripes for the first time. It was this season when the Lechia badge featured on the shirts for the first time, however, the badge did not return to the Lechia shirts until the 1996\u201397 season. After that season Lechia wore all green shirts until the 2002\u201303 season when Lechia wore an all-white kit. 2006\u201307 saw for the first time in Lechia's history the team wore an all-white kit with green hoops on the shirt, the same colours worn by &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Lw%C3%B3w\"&gt;Lechia Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, from which the expelled fans after WW2 created Lechia Gda\u0144sk. Since the turn of the century, Lechia has been more creative with their designs for the home kits. From the team wearing all green home shirts from 1960 to 2002, there has since been a return of the green and white stripes for the 2011\u201312 season, an all-white kit with a green sash on the front for the 2012\u201314 seasons, as well as the hooped design, which was first worn in the 2006\u201307, and has since been worn during the 2008\u201310 seasons, and continuously since the 2015\u201316 season. The only time in Lechia's early history when the club deviated from their traditional white or green was in the &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;1982\u201383 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt; final when the team wore white shirts, red shorts, and white socks, colours reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Lechia's history, the away shirt colours have often always been the opposite of the home shirt. When the home shirt was green, the away was white, and vice versa. 2009 saw the introduction of Lechia's first non-white/green kit, with an all-black away kit introduced. Lechia released an all red third shirt for the 2014\u201315 season, with an all-red kit being used as the club's away or third colours from 2014 to 2020. The 2018\u201319 season saw the introduction of another previously unused colour for a kit. Lechia wore an all-grey away kit for that season, replacing the all green kit which had been the away kit for the previous season. This grey kit was used by the team from 2018 to 2022 and was notably worn by Lechia in two cup finals.\nWhile white and green have always been the club's home colours, Lechia have not always worn these colours while playing at home. On 9 February 2019 Lechia wore an all-black kit for their home game against &lt;a href=\"Pogo%C5%84%20Szczecin\"&gt;Pogo\u0144 Szczecin&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate the death of &lt;a href=\"Pawe%C5%82%20Adamowicz\"&gt;Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;mayor of Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; at the time of his murder, and a lifelong Lechia fan. This was the first time in their history a predominantly green or white kit wasn't worn by Lechia for a home game. The game finished 2\u20131 to Lechia, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Filip%20Mladenovi%C4%87\"&gt;Filip Mladenovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Paix%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;. An all-red kit was worn on 10 November 2019, again against &lt;a href=\"Pogo%C5%84%20Szczecin\"&gt;Pogo\u0144 Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;, to commemorate the 101st anniversary of &lt;a href=\"National%20Independence%20Day%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Polish independence&lt;/a&gt;. That same match Lechia attempted to break the Polish record for most people singing the full Polish &lt;a href=\"Poland%20Is%20Not%20Yet%20Lost\"&gt;national anthem&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, which was 3,171 people, breaking the record with 7,614.\nCup winning kits.\nThe Lechia Gda\u0144sk kits worn when the club has won a cup final.\nBadge history.\nThe badge design of Lechia has stayed roughly the same since 1945 with only slight changes when the club's name changed or when Lechia had a merger with another club. The design of the Lechia badge has always been a &lt;a href=\"Pennon\"&gt;triangular pennant&lt;/a&gt; with the flagpole on the left. The flag has always been green, with a white horizontal stripe through the middle, and the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; coat of arms in the centre. The name \"Lechia\" has always featured on the badge. In 1995 Lechia experienced a major change to their official club badge. The merger with &lt;a href=\"Olimpia%20Poznan\"&gt;Olimpia Poznan&lt;/a&gt; saw the flag featured in a circle with \"Olimpia\u2013Lechia Gdansk\" featured at the bottom. A similar thing happened again when Lechia experienced a merger with &lt;a href=\"SKS%20Stoczniowiec%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Polonia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. After the Polonia merger broke up in 2001, Lechia returned once again to their normal badge design, which has been used continuously since then with only minor changes in 2016.\nThe badge was often not worn on the shirts. They were first worn on the kits in 1960, with a return in 1963. After the 1963\u201364 season the badges did not reappear again until 1996 but have featured on every shirt since. The first symbol to appear on a Lechia shirt was a large white \"L\" which featured on the shirts for the 1947\u201348 season.\nBanners.\nBanners first started to appear at Lechia's &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Gda%C5%84skiego%20O%C5%9Brodka%20Sportu\"&gt;MOSiR Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s with the first Lechia banners made and displayed being \"\"'Lechia Pany!\" (as is the case with most flags and banners, it is stylised in all capitals) and \"Lechia Karwiny\" (Karwiny being a district in Gdynia). Other older flags that make regular appearances in Lechia games are those displaying \"Forza Lechia\", \"Lechia Pride of Gda\u0144sk\", \"Bia\u0142o-Zieloni\", and \"Lechia Gda\u0144sk Forever\"\". Banners have been used to display support for the team, show where the fans are from (such as the English fan club, Malbork, Sopot, etc.), political statements, and support for friendly teams (such as \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, &lt;a href=\"Gryf%20S%C5%82upsk\"&gt;Gryf S\u0142upsk&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w). Over the years some of the older flags displayed have been damaged, stolen, or remade. Many flags were stored by the Lechia Ultra's in a warehouse which was broken into and the flags stolen, leaving only those stored elsewhere, or kept by individuals, to survive the raid, while many of the older flags have been damaged through wear and tear, complications with storage, and simply through age. Many iconic flags for the fans throughout the clubs history have often been remade due to age, these include the remaking of the original flags showing the Gda\u0144sk districts, such as \"\"Che\u0142m\", \"Orunia\", \"Oliwa\", and \"Morena\"\". In total over 300 flags and banners have been documented throughout Lechia's history.\nThe stealing of banners can give ultra groups a sense of prestige and a higher status and standing among ultra groups from other clubs. Once instance of Lechia stealing a flag was in 2007 when Lechia fans stole a \"W\u0142adcy P\u00f3\u0142nocy\" banner belonging to Arka Gdynia. During the Tricity Derby that season the Lechia fans showed disrespect to Arka by hanging the banner upside down before setting the banner on fire. After the banner had been burned the fans revealed their own version of the \"W\u0142adcy P\u00f3\u0142nocy\", in the same style as the Arka banner, but in white and green instead of blue and yellow. The Lechia \"W\u0142adcy P\u00f3\u0142nocy\" banner has featured predominantly at home games since 2007.\nRecords and statistics.\nPlayer statistics.\nThe top ten most appearances and goal scorers for Lechia Gda\u0144sk.\nClub sponsors and kit manufacturers.\nIt is important to note that sometimes there is an overlap between the years and when there are different club sponsors and kit manufacturers. This is due to the fact that in the late 1990's and early 2000's it was common for Lechia to wear multiple kits made by different manufactures in the same season. For example, during the 2003\u201304 season Lechia wore kits manufactured by wit-sport, Legea, Erima, and kits that were self-made.\nNotes\n\u2020 During the 1995\u201396 season the Olimpia-Lechia team started the season with kids being made by local kit manufacturer PJ Sport and with the team sponsor being Nata. During the winter break Kelme took over as kit manufacturer and Canal+ became the teams main sponsor.\n\u2021 During the 1999\u20132000 season the Lechia-Polonia team used four different kits made by three different manufacturers. With each different manufactured kit Lechia had a different sponsor on the front of that shirt.\n\u00a7 This design was the only one worn by the three teams that have played under the Lechia Gda\u0144sk name. This particular shirt shown was worn by Lechia Gda\u0144sk between 1996\u201398. When this design was worn by Olimpia-Lechia in 1996 it was with Canal+ sponsorship and not with the Nata sponsorship.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Polish%20SuperCup\"&gt;Polish SuperCup&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"I%20liga\"&gt;I liga&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"II%20liga\"&gt;II liga&lt;/a&gt;\nEuropean Competitions\nLeague participation.\nAs of the 2021\u201322 season.\nOwnership.\nDuring the communist era of the club's history, it was owned and run by employment sectors. When the club was first created it was used for the workers of the Port Reconstruction Office (), and thus owned by the Port Reconstruction Office itself, later becoming a club for construction workers (). Both \"Biuro Odbudowy Port\u00f3w\" and \"Budowlani\" being included in the club's official name when they were run by these sectors.\nIn 2007 Tadeusz D\u0105browski unsuccessfully tried to invest in the club. In 2009 Andrzej Kuchar became the majority shareholder for the club, a position he held until late 2013 when he sold his shares.\nIn 2014 it became known that 72% of the club shares are controlled by an investment company named Wroclawskie Centrum finansowo (WCF) with the club being owned by Franz-Josef Wernze. WCF is owned by Swiss investor W&amp;C Verm\u00f6gensverwaltungs AG in which Philipp Wernze, the son of the German businessman and Lechia owner Franz-Josef Wernze, is involved. In summer 2014 this German control over Lechia became more and more obvious when several players from Germany joined the club. Under Wernze's wings are also the German clubs &lt;a href=\"FC%20Viktoria%20K%C3%B6ln\"&gt;Viktoria K\u00f6ln&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig\"&gt;Lok Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017 the shares of the company's main shareholder, Lechia Investment, were taken over from W&amp;C Verm\u00f6gensverwaltungs by Advancesport AG. This saw Franz-Josef Wernze staying as the owner of Lechia, but with his son Philipp Wernze, the main shareholder in Advancesport AG, having a greater role within the club and within his father's company, &lt;a href=\"ETL%20Group\"&gt;ETL Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n \nNotable players.\nThe players below played for their respective countries at any point during their career with the dates showing their time with Lechia.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk II and Lechia's Academy.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk II.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk operates an official second team, known as &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20II%20and%20Lechia%27s%20Academy\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk II&lt;/a&gt;, which currently plays in the fifth tier in the IV liga Pomerania. In its early years the second team was only used for games in the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Cup\"&gt;Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, fielding teams in four cup competitions in their first 50 years as a club. For the 1995\u201396 season the merger between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and &lt;a href=\"Olimpia%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Olimpia Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; creating &lt;a href=\"Olimpia-Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Olimpia-Lechia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, saw the second team running as the continuation of the \"Lechia Gda\u0144sk\" team in the III liga.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk II officially became the second team in the Polish league system for the 2005\u201306 season. The purpose of the second team was to provide more playing experience for the younger players, while providing game time for players returning from injury. The second team played for 11 continuous seasons, achieving their highest result of 2nd in the III liga in the 2014\u201315 season. In 2016 it was announced that the second team was to be discontinued before it was reintroduced again for the start of the 2018\u201319 season.\nLechia Gda\u0144sk Academy.\nIn 2015 it was announced that all of the youth teams would once again be returning to Lechia, with Lechia taking control of coaching and player development. It was announced that there would be 11 age groups which would make up the Academy starting from the Under-7's to the Under-23's. After 3 years, the Lechia Academy had 12 teams under their control, with other 200 staff seeing over the development. From the summer of 2019 the academy has been home to multiple levels of girls football teams with the formal incorporation of the &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk%20Ladies\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk Ladies&lt;/a&gt; into the Lechia Gda\u0144sk structure.\nPartnerships.\nLechia have partnerships with academies in the Gda\u0144sk and surrounding regions. The agreements provide Lechia with the best players, the teams to take part in competitions organised by Lechia, and better training for the coaches. Currently Lechia have partnerships with APK Jedynka Kartuzy, GAP Sparta Gda\u0144sk, Unia Tczew, and AWFiS Gda\u0144sk.\nCurrent partnerships\nFormer partnerships\nLechia Gda\u0144sk Ladies.\nInitially Lechia Gda\u0144sk was in close cooperation with &lt;a href=\"Grupa%20Lotos\"&gt;Grupa Lotos&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"AP%20LOTOS%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;AP LOTOS Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; academy and ladies football team. The team was formerly known as \"Akademia Pi\u0142karska Lechia Gda\u0144sk\" due to the close association the two teams once had. The ladies team wore the Lechia kits to start with before disagreements led to Lechia and APLG starting to work more independently. Due to APLG and Lechia going in different directions Lechia's focus was less on the APLG ladies team and making a team of their own.\nLechia became closely linked with Bia\u0142o-Zielone Gda\u0144sk, which was formed in 2014. Bia\u0142o-Zielone was another team closely linked with Lechia but was not officially part of the Lechia set up. In 2019 it was announced that the team would be incorporated into the Lechia Gda\u0144sk academy structure and that their name was to become Lechia Gda\u0144sk Ladies. The Lechia Ladies team currently plays in the III liga (Pomeranian group).\nManagers.\nThe following list contains the statistics from all competitive games after 1 July 2001, when Lechia Gda\u0144sk was re-founded in the sixth tier.\nStats correct as of 31 December 2021.

Lechia Lw\u00f3w was the oldest football team in Poland with many of the fans of the team moving to Gda\u0144sk after Poland's borders were changed after World War II, &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; being given to &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and the expulsion of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20evacuation%20and%20expulsion\"&gt;Poles from Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Lechia Lw\u00f3w and Lechia Gda\u0144sk sharing many of the same fans, Lechia Gda\u0144sk is often seen as Lechia Lw\u00f3w's \"sister team\". Lechia Lw\u00f3w often played in the Polish second division, playing once in the top tier in the 1931 season suffering relegation that same season. The Lechia Gda\u0144sk 2012\u201313 kit had \"1903\" written on their socks in commemoration of Lechia Lw\u00f3w's 110 year anniversary since their founding.\nIn 2019 the &lt;a href=\"Retro%20Liga\"&gt;Retro Liga&lt;/a&gt; was formed in Poland of teams who had been disbanded in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II. The league followed the same rules and kit standards of those in 1919 when the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Polish Football Association&lt;/a&gt; was formed. Lechia Lw\u00f3w were crowned the inaugural winners of the Retro Liga at the end of the 2019 season, also defending their title for the 2020 season.\nAmber Cup Tournament.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Cup%20Tournament\"&gt;Amber Cup Tournament&lt;/a&gt; (created 2006) is the biggest indoor footballing event in Poland, taking place in January during the football leagues' winter break. Lechia Gda\u0144sk took a team to the Amber Cup every year from 2011 until 2018 and are the tournaments most successful team, winning the tournament four times (2011, 2013, 2016 &amp; 2017).
