    "text": "Samuel Adrian Baugh (March 17, 1914\u00a0\u2013 December 17, 2008) was an American professional &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach. During his college and professional careers, he most notably played &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt;, but also played as a &lt;a href=\"defensive%20back\"&gt;defensive back&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"punter%20%28football%29\"&gt;punter&lt;/a&gt;. He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"TCU%20Horned%20Frogs%20football\"&gt;Horned Frogs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Christian%20University\"&gt;Texas Christian University&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a two-time &lt;a href=\"All-American\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt;. He then played in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) for the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Redskins\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1937%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1937&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1952%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1952&lt;/a&gt;. After his playing career, he served as a college coach for &lt;a href=\"Hardin%E2%80%93Simmons%20University\"&gt;Hardin\u2013Simmons University&lt;/a&gt; before coaching professionally for the &lt;a href=\"Titans%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;New York Titans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Oilers\"&gt;Houston Oilers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaugh led the Washington Redskins to winning the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Championship\"&gt;NFL Championship&lt;/a&gt; in and and was named NFL Player of the Year by the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20D.C.%20Touchdown%20Club\"&gt;Washington D.C. Touchdown Club&lt;/a&gt; in and for his play. In both of his Player of the Year seasons, he led the league in completions, attempts, completion percentage, and yards. In 1947, he also led the league in passing touchdowns, interception percentage and passer rating.\nPrimarily known for his passing prowess, Baugh led the league in &lt;a href=\"completion%20percentage\"&gt;completion percentage&lt;/a&gt; a record eight times, passing yards four times, and three times in &lt;a href=\"passer%20rating\"&gt;passer rating&lt;/a&gt;, among other statistics. However, he was also known for his versatility\u2014having the ability to play at a high level as a &lt;a href=\"Punter%20%28football%29\"&gt;punter&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=\"defensive%20back\"&gt;defensive back&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his career, he led the league in yards per punt five times, as well as yardage in , a year in which he also led the league in defensive interceptions, with 11. His yards per punt of 51.4 during the season still stands as an NFL record as of 2020.\nBaugh was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in the 17-member charter class of 1963, and was also selected to the &lt;a href=\"NFL%2075th%20Anniversary%20All-Time%20Team\"&gt;NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 and the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20100th%20Anniversary%20All-Time%20Team\"&gt;NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.\nEarly life.\nSamuel Adrian Baugh was born on a farm near &lt;a href=\"Temple%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Temple, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the second son of James, a worker on the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20Railroad\"&gt;Santa Fe Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, and Lucy Baugh. His parents later divorced and his mother raised the three children. When he was 16, the family then moved to &lt;a href=\"Sweetwater%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Sweetwater, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and he attended &lt;a href=\"Sweetwater%20High%20School%20%28Sweetwater%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;Sweetwater High School&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;high school football&lt;/a&gt; team (Sweetwater Mustangs), he would practice for hours throwing a football through a swinging automobile tire, often on the run. Baugh would practice &lt;a href=\"Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29\"&gt;punting&lt;/a&gt; more than throwing.\nBaugh, however, really wanted to become a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; player and almost received a &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20scholarship\"&gt;scholarship&lt;/a&gt; to play at &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20University\"&gt;Washington State University&lt;/a&gt;. About a month before he started at Washington State, however, Baugh hurt his knee while sliding into second base during a game, and the scholarship fell through.\nCollege career.\nCollege football.\nAfter coach &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Meyer\"&gt;Dutch Meyer&lt;/a&gt; told him he could play three sports (&lt;a href=\"american%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;), Baugh attended &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Christian%20University\"&gt;Texas Christian University&lt;/a&gt;. While at Texas Christian, he threw 587 passes in his three varsity seasons for 39 touchdowns. Baugh was named an &lt;a href=\"All-America\"&gt;All-America&lt;/a&gt;n in 1935 and 1936. He also led &lt;a href=\"TCU%20Horned%20Frogs%20football\"&gt;TCU&lt;/a&gt; to two &lt;a href=\"bowl%20game\"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt; wins, a 3\u20132 victory over &lt;a href=\"LSU%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;LSU&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;1936 Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, and a 16\u20136 victory over &lt;a href=\"Marquette%20Golden%20Eagles\"&gt;Marquette&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1937%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic\"&gt;first annual Cotton Bowl Classic in 1937&lt;/a&gt; after which he was named &lt;a href=\"Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic%23MVPs\"&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt;. He finished fourth in voting for the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; in 1936.\nIn the spring of his senior year, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Redskins\"&gt;Redskins&lt;/a&gt; owner &lt;a href=\"George%20Preston%20Marshall\"&gt;George Preston Marshall&lt;/a&gt; offered Baugh $4,000 to play with the franchise. Originally unsure about playing professional football (coach Meyer offered him a job as the freshman coach and he still thought about playing professional baseball), he did not agree to the contract until after the &lt;a href=\"College%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;College All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, where the team beat the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20130.\nCollege and minor league baseball.\nBaugh was also a baseball player at Texas Christian, where he played &lt;a href=\"third%20base\"&gt;third base&lt;/a&gt;. It was during his time as a baseball player that he earned the nickname \"Slingin' Sammy\", which he got from a &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; sportswriter. After college, Sammy signed a contract with the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; to play with the American Association &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Red%20Birds\"&gt;Columbus Red Birds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; after being converted to &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt;. He was then sent to the International League's &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Rochester, New York&lt;/a&gt; Red Wings, St. Louis's other top farm club. While there he received little playing time behind starting shortstop &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Marion\"&gt;Marty Marion&lt;/a&gt; and was unhappy with his prospects. He then turned to professional football.\nProfessional career.\nAs expected, Baugh was &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; in the first round (sixth overall) of the &lt;a href=\"1937%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1937 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Redskins\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;, the same year the team moved from &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. He signed a one-year contract with the Redskins and received $8,000, making him the highest-paid player on the team.\nDuring his rookie season in &lt;a href=\"1937%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1937&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh played &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; (although in Washington's formation he was officially lined up as a tailback or halfback until 1944), &lt;a href=\"defensive%20back\"&gt;defensive back&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Punter%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;punter&lt;/a&gt;, set an NFL record for completions with 91 in 218 attempts and threw for a league-high 1,127 yards. He led the Redskins to the &lt;a href=\"1937%20NFL%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;NFL Championship game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"1937%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, where he finished 17 of 33 for 335 yards and his second-half touchdown passes of 55, 78 and 33 yards gave Washington a 28\u201321 victory. His 335 passing yards remained the most ever in a playoff game by any rookie quarterback in NFL history until &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Wilson\"&gt;Russell Wilson&lt;/a&gt; broke the record in &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20NFL%20playoffs\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. The Redskins and &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; would meet three times in championship games between &lt;a href=\"1940%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1940&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1943%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1940%20NFL%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1940 Championship game&lt;/a&gt;, the Bears recorded the most one-sided victory in NFL history, beating Washington 73\u20130. After the game, Baugh was asked what would have happened if the Redskins' first drive had resulted in a touchdown. He shrugged and replied \"What? The score would have been 73\u20137.\"\nBaugh's heyday would come during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1942%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh and the &lt;a href=\"1942%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Redskins&lt;/a&gt; won the East Conference with a 10\u20131 record. During the same season the Bears went 11\u20130 and outscored their opponents 376\u201384. In the &lt;a href=\"1942%20NFL%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1942 Championship game&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh threw a touchdown pass and kept the &lt;a href=\"1942%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; in their own territory with some strong punts, including an 85-yard quick kick, and Washington won 14\u20136.\nBaugh had what many consider to be the greatest single-season performance by a pro football player during &lt;a href=\"1943%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt; in which he led the league in pass completions, &lt;a href=\"Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29\"&gt;punting&lt;/a&gt; (45.9-yard average) and &lt;a href=\"interceptions\"&gt;interceptions&lt;/a&gt; (11). One of Baugh's more memorable single-game performances during the season was when he threw four touchdown passes and intercepted four passes in a 42\u201320 victory over &lt;a href=\"1943%20Detroit%20Lions%20season\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. He was selected as an All-Pro tailback that year. The Redskins again made it to the &lt;a href=\"1943%20NFL%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;championship game&lt;/a&gt;, but lost to the &lt;a href=\"1943%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; 41\u201321. During the game, Baugh suffered a &lt;a href=\"concussion\"&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; while tackling Bears &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Luckman\"&gt;Sid Luckman&lt;/a&gt; and had to leave.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1945%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1945 season&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh completed 128 of 182 passes for a 70.33 completion percentage, which was an NFL record then and remains the fourth-best today (to &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Anderson%20%28quarterback%29\"&gt;Ken Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, 70.55 in &lt;a href=\"1982%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Brees\"&gt;Drew Brees&lt;/a&gt;, 70.62 in &lt;a href=\"2009%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, 71.23 in &lt;a href=\"2011%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). He threw 11 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. The Redskins again won the East Conference but lost 15\u201314 in the &lt;a href=\"1945%20NFL%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1945 Championship game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"1945%20Cleveland%20Rams%20season\"&gt;Cleveland Rams&lt;/a&gt;. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a &lt;a href=\"Safety%20%28American%20football%20score%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the &lt;a href=\"end%20zone\"&gt;end zone&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post (which at the time was on the goal line instead of at the back of the end zone) and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2\u20130 lead. It was that safety that proved to be the margin of victory. Owner Marshall was so angry at the outcome that he became a major force in passing the following major rule change after the season: A forward pass that strikes the goal posts is automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the \"Baugh/Marshall Rule\".\nOne of Baugh's more memorable single performances came on \"Sammy Baugh Day\" on November 23, 1947. That day, the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20D.C.%20Touchdown%20Club\"&gt;Washington D.C. Touchdown Club&lt;/a&gt; honored him at &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Stadium\"&gt;Griffith Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and gave him a &lt;a href=\"station%20wagon\"&gt;station wagon&lt;/a&gt;. Against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%2C%201920%E2%80%9359%29\"&gt;Chicago Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; he passed for 355 yards and six touchdowns. That season, the Redskins finished 4\u20138, but Baugh had career highs in completions (210), attempts (354), yards (2,938) and touchdown passes (25), leading the league in all four categories.\nBaugh played for five more years\u2014leading the league in completion percentage for the sixth and seventh times in &lt;a href=\"1948%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1949%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;. He then retired after the &lt;a href=\"1952%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1952 season&lt;/a&gt;. In his final game, a 27\u201321 win over &lt;a href=\"1952%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Stadium\"&gt;Griffith Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, he played for several minutes before retiring to a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. Baugh won numerous NFL passing titles and earned first-team All-NFL honors four times in his career. He completed 1,693 of 2,995 passes for 21,886 yards.\nRecords.\nBy the time he retired, Baugh set 13 NFL records in three player positions: quarterback, punter, and defensive back. He is considered one of the all-time great football players. He gave birth to the fanaticism of Redskins fans. As &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Wilbon\"&gt;Michael Wilbon&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" says: \"He brought not just victories but thrills and ignited Washington with a passion even the worst Redskins periods can barely diminish.\" He was the first to play the position of quarterback as it is played today, the first to make of the forward pass an effective weapon rather than an \"act of desperation\".\nTwo of his records as quarterback still stand: most seasons leading the league in passing (six; tied with &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Young%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Steve Young&lt;/a&gt;) and most seasons leading the league with the lowest interception percentage (five). He is also fourth in highest single-season completion percentage (70.33), most seasons leading the league in yards gained (four) and most seasons leading the league in completion percentage (seven).\nAs a punter, Baugh retired with the NFL record for highest punting average in a career (45.1 yards), and is still second all-time (&lt;a href=\"Shane%20Lechler\"&gt;Shane Lechler&lt;/a&gt; 46.5 yards), and has the best (51.4 in 1940) and fourth-best (48.7 in 1941) season marks. He led the league in punting from &lt;a href=\"1940%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1940&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"1943%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt;. As a defensive back, he was the first player in league history to intercept four passes in a game, and is the only player to lead the league in passing, punting, and interceptions in the same season.\nAs one of the best-known of the early NFL quarterbacks, Baugh is likely to be compared to more recent great players. As noted by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Wilbon\"&gt;Michael Wilbon&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\", the football of Baugh's era was rounder at the ends and fatter in the middle than the one used today, making it far more difficult to pass well (or even to create a proper spiral). Additionally, it is important to point out that pass-interference rules have intensified dramatically, inflating modern quarterbacks' statistics.\nCoaching career.\nWhile playing for the Redskins, Baugh and teammate &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Millner\"&gt;Wayne Millner&lt;/a&gt; were assistant coaches with &lt;a href=\"The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America\"&gt;The Catholic University of America&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, and went with them to the &lt;a href=\"1940%20Sun%20Bowl\"&gt;1940 Sun Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Baugh left Washington, D.C. in 1952. He chose not to return for Redskins team functions, despite repeated organization invitations. After his playing career, he became head coach at &lt;a href=\"Hardin%E2%80%93Simmons%20University\"&gt;Hardin\u2013Simmons University&lt;/a&gt; where he compiled a 23\u201328 record between 1955 and 1959.\nBaugh was the first coach of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Titans%20%28football%29\"&gt;New York Titans&lt;/a&gt; (which eventually became the New York Jets) of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League\"&gt;American Football League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1960%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1961%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt; compiling a record of 14\u201314. He was an assistant at the &lt;a href=\"Tulsa%20Golden%20Hurricane%20football\"&gt;University of Tulsa&lt;/a&gt; in 1963 under head coach &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Dobbs\"&gt;Glenn Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;. At Tulsa, he coached &lt;a href=\"All-America\"&gt;All-America&lt;/a&gt;n quarterback &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Rhome\"&gt;Jerry Rhome&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1964%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;, Baugh coached the AFL's &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Oilers\"&gt;Houston Oilers&lt;/a&gt; and went 4\u201310.\nActing.\nBaugh also took up acting. In 1941, he made $6,400 for starring in a 12-week &lt;a href=\"Serial%20%28film%29\"&gt;serial&lt;/a&gt; as a dark-haired Texas Ranger named Tom King. The serial, called \"&lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Texas%20Rangers\"&gt;King of the Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;\", was released by &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Studios\"&gt;Republic Studios&lt;/a&gt;. The episodes ran in theaters as Saturday matinees; it also starred &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Renaldo\"&gt;Duncan Renaldo&lt;/a&gt;, later famous as TV's &lt;a href=\"Cisco%20Kid\"&gt;Cisco Kid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Duvall\"&gt;Robert Duvall&lt;/a&gt; patterned the role of Gus McCrae in the television series \"&lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Dove\"&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/a&gt;\" after Baugh, particularly his arm movements, after visiting him at his home in Texas in 1988.\nPersonal and later life.\nAfter retiring from football, Baugh and his wife Edmonia Smith moved to the ranch, where they had four boys and a girl. Edmonia died in 1990, after 52 years of marriage to Baugh, who was her high school sweetheart. According to his son, Baugh derived far more pleasure from ranching than he ever had from football, saying that he enjoyed the game, but if he could live his life over again, he probably wouldn't play sports at all. Incidentally, Baugh always introduced himself as Sam Baugh and signed his papers and autographs that way. Much like fellow football great &lt;a href=\"Byron%20White\"&gt;Judge \"Whizzer\" White&lt;/a&gt; of Colorado, he said sports writers had tagged him with \"Slingin' Sammy\" and that Sam was his preferred name. TCU named its football practice center the Sam Baugh Football Center with that perspective in mind.\nBaugh's health began to decline after the death of his wife. During his last years, he lived in a nursing home in a little West Texas town called Jayton, not far from &lt;a href=\"Double%20Mountain%20%28Texas%29\"&gt;Double Mountain&lt;/a&gt; Ranch. The Double Mountain Ranch is now in the hands of Baugh's son David and is still a &lt;a href=\"cow-calf%20operation\"&gt;cow-calf operation&lt;/a&gt;, on .\nDeath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; quoted Baugh's son on December 17, 2008, saying Baugh had died after numerous health issues, including &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, at Fisher County Hospital in &lt;a href=\"Rotan%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rotan, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. He is interred at Belvieu Cemetery in Rotan.\nHonors and tributes.\nBaugh was the last surviving member of the 17-member charter class of the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, he was honored by the Redskins with the retirement of his jersey number, No. 33, one of only two numbers officially retired by the team.\n&lt;a href=\"Hip%20hop\"&gt;Hip hop&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Jay-Z\"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt; wore Baugh's &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20%26amp%3B%20Ness\"&gt;Mitchell &amp; Ness&lt;/a&gt; 1947 Washington jersey in his 2002 video for \"&lt;a href=\"Girls%2C%20Girls%2C%20Girls%20%28Jay-Z%20song%29\"&gt;Girls, Girls, Girls&lt;/a&gt;.\" This increased demand for the throwback jersey and renewed popular awareness of Baugh.\nNFL career statistics.\n\"Source\":"
