    "text": "De La Salle University \u2013 Dasmari\u00f1as (DLSU-D or La Salle \u2013 Dasma; ) is a private Roman Catholic Lasallian co-educational secondary and higher education institution run by the &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20Brothers\"&gt;De La Salle Brothers&lt;/a&gt; of the Philippine District of the Christian Brothers in &lt;a href=\"Dasmari%C3%B1as\"&gt;Dasmari\u00f1as&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. It is a member of &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20Philippines\"&gt;De La Salle Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, a network of Lasallian educational institutions within the Lasallian East Asia District.\nDLSU-D, despite its name, is an autonomous university separate from the &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20University\"&gt;De La Salle University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;. Both universities are members of the De La Salle Philippines System. Also, approximately from it is the &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20Medical%20and%20Health%20Sciences%20Institute\"&gt;De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a separate De La Salle campus that specializes in medicine and allied health education which is often mistaken as part of DLSU-D due to the proximity of both campuses.\nHistory.\nThe university was established on July 18, 1977, as a private nonsectarian tertiary school named \"General Emilio Aguinaldo College-Cavite\" and managed by the Yaman Lahi Foundation. In 1987, ownership and management were transferred to Fr\u00e8re (St.) &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9nilde%20Roman%C3%A7on\"&gt;B\u00e9nilde Roman\u00e7on&lt;/a&gt; Educational Foundation Inc., a sister corporation of &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20University-Manila\"&gt;De La Salle University-Manila&lt;/a&gt;. It became a Catholic institution under the name De La Salle University-Emilio Aguinaldo College. In 1992, the name DLSU-EAC was changed to De La Salle University-Aguinaldo. In 1997, the institution's name was changed again. It is now called De La Salle University \u2013 Dasmari\u00f1as to avoid confusion with the &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Aguinaldo%20College\"&gt;Emilio Aguinaldo College&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cavite\"&gt;Cavite&lt;/a&gt; campus.\nCampus.\nEast campus.\nThe East campus is occupied by the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Communication, Science and Computer Studies, Tourism and Hospitality Management. The bookstore, different laboratories, chapel, museum, and the Aklatang Emilio Aguinaldo are also located here.\nCultural Heritage Complex.\nAs part of DLSU-D's aim for cultural development, and maintaining its Spanish-period-inspired motif, the three structures in the Museum Complex were officially named the Cultural Heritage Complex.\nMuseo De La Salle is a museum dedicated to the preservation of certain aspects and material culture of the 19th-century Philippine ilustrado lifestyle. The Museo was built to contribute to cross-disciplinary learning and growth in the academic environment, and to provide a fine example of Philippine culture that is linked to its immediate community while being open to the outside world.\nIts collection comprises antique family heirlooms such as furniture, decorative objects, fine and applied arts displayed in faithfully recreated rooms, donated by, or on long-term loan from collectors. Among the donors and lenders are Jose Ma. Ricardo A. Panlilio of the Santos-Joven Panlilio family of Bacolor, Pampanga; Brother Andrew Gonzalez, FSC, of the Arnedo-Gonzales family of Sulipan Apalit, Pampanga; Marie Theresa Lammoglia-Virata, Victorina Vizcarra Amali\u00f1gan, the D.M. Guevara Foundation Inc., Paulino and Hetty Que, former National Commission for Culture and the Arts Chairman Jaime C. Laya and international jeweler Fe Sarmiento - Panlilio. The construction and design of the Museo, which was a collaboration between project leader Jose Ma. Panlilio and the architectural team of OBMapua and Partners led by architects Joel Lopez and Obi Mapua Jr. took years to finish in its aim to faithfully represent the lifestyle of the period.\nWest campus.\nSituated in the West campus, 600\u00a0meters away from the East campus, are the Colleges of Business Administration and Accountancy, Engineering, Architecture and Technology, the condominiums, dormitories, canteens, and the administration building.\nAffiliations.\nDe La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as is a member of &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20Philippines\"&gt;De La Salle Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, a network of 17 Lasallian institutions established in 2006. DLSP is the successor of the &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20Philippines%23Historical%20background\"&gt;De La Salle University System&lt;/a&gt;, a similar organization.\nThe university also sustains linkages with local universities &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle-Santiago%20Zobel%20School\"&gt;De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Baguio\"&gt;University of Baguio&lt;/a&gt;, University of Batangas, Central Luzon State University, industries ( &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Airlines\"&gt;Philippine Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ABS-CBN%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, Intel, Jollibee-Fast Food Career Dev't.

The name was adopted in 1997, a reference to the province's history during the uprising against the Spanish rule in the Philippines.\n&lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt; are the school's main sports.

Their basketball playing style has given them marginal success that includes a runner-up finish in the UCAA against their former namesake Emilio Aguinaldo College in 2005.\nHuman Lasallian Star.\nThe Lasallian \"Signum Fidei\" Sign of Faith Star is a 350-year-old international symbol of the Christian Brothers of the De La Salle Schools that represents their religious vocation of quality God-centered, Christian-values-based education in 1,500 Lasallian institutions and 70 Universities and Colleges that's globally established in 82 countries. The Signum Fidei Lasallian was inspired by the Nativity Christmas Star from Bethlehem that symbolized Saint La Salle's mission of Teaching Minds, Touching Hearts and Transforming Lives of the poor. The Lasallian mission was to give hope to the Last, Least, and the Lost of the most venerable youth in our society.\nThe Human Lasallian Star first came to life on February 11, 2009, during the Lasallian Days Festival as a means to encourage all Lasallians to show their school spirit in an environment of camaraderie and shared ideals. Attended by over 10,000 administrators, students, and faculty, the first attempt to form the largest human star in the world was held at the DLSU-D oval and was witnessed by spectators from the top of the CBA building and the DLSU-D grandstand. The star spanned approximately 71\u00a0 meters, and occupied a total area of 2,145 square meters.\nDLSU-D attempted the feat again on January 26, 2010, this time at night. The event drew in 13,000 participants: students, faculty, administrators, and parents. Participants were given the glow sticks of green and white, the school colors of De La Salle. As night fell, the crowd assembled into a huge star twinkling brightly against the darkness. This moment of history was further heightened by the singing of the school hymn.\nLa Estrella Verde.\nLa Estrella Verde (LEV) is the official &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20the%20Philippines%23Senior%20High%20School\"&gt;Senior High School&lt;/a&gt; (SHS) student publication of De La Salle University\u2013Dasmari\u00f1as. Founded and established in 2016, the publication serves as a medium (through print, online, and radio) for students to be aware of all current events and latest updates happening around the senior high school community.\nIts name translates to \"The Green Star.\"\nANIMOSAIC 2: Humans of St. La Salle.\nDe La Salle University Dasmari\u00f1as (DLSU-D) had broken records with its human formation of the Lasallian star and a coin mural of the school logo. To commemorate the 300th feast day of its founder, thousands of people held color-coded umbrellas to form the image of St John Baptist De La Salle at the DLSU-D Track Oval on Sunday, April 7, 2019. About 6,000 students, employees, and stakeholders of DLSU-D participated in the fundraising event dubbed as \"Animosaic 2: Humans of St La Salle.\" The fundraising event is dedicated to all the scholars and aspiring scholars of DLSU-D. Seeking to beat the record set by China after it formed a giant human smiley with 3,099 participants in 2016, Lasallians made their own bid for the record with some 6,000 Lasallians forming the image of St. John Baptist de La Salle, the university name as well as the #300LaSalle which signifies the 300th death anniversary of the Father Founder. The event is made more significant as it was celebrated with the Feast Day of St. La Salle. The event is also consistent with Lasallian institutions all around the world making their own human formations of the image of St. John de La Salle as part of the Humans of St. La Salle initiative."
