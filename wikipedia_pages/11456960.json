    "text": "Eduard Franz Schmidt (October 31, 1902 \u2013 February 10, 1983) was an American actor of theatre, film and television. Franz portrayed King &lt;a href=\"Ahab\"&gt;Ahab&lt;/a&gt; in the 1953 biblical &lt;a href=\"low-budget%20film\"&gt;low-budget film&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Sins%20of%20Jezebel\"&gt;Sins of Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Jethro%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20B.%20DeMille\"&gt;Cecil B. DeMille&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29\"&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;\" (1956), and Jehoam in &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Koster\"&gt;Henry Koster&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Ruth\"&gt;The Story of Ruth&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960).\nLife and career.\nFranz was born in &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. His childhood ambition was to become a commercial artist, a goal that led him to enroll later at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, where he joined the Wisconsin Players Theater, a new student group. Performing in the theater's 1922-1923 season reignited his ambition to become an artist, although one of a different type, an actor. A year later, he was cast in Chicago productions of the Coffee-Miller Players. Dropping his surname, Franz next acted with the Provincetown Players in New York's Greenwich Village, a hothouse of theatrical ferment that had first brought the world the dramatic works of writers &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20O%27Neill\"&gt;Eugene O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Glaspell\"&gt;Susan Glaspell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay\"&gt;Edna St. Vincent Millay&lt;/a&gt;. Franz also appeared with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robeson\"&gt;Paul Robeson&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Emperor%20Jones\"&gt;The Emperor Jones&lt;/a&gt;\" and with Walter Huston in \"&lt;a href=\"Desire%20Under%20the%20Elms\"&gt;Desire Under the Elms&lt;/a&gt;\". He continued to perform until his stage work was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy then married to his wife Margaret, he tried to eke out a living as chicken farmers in Texas. The young couple soon returned to Wisconsin, where Franz acted in regional theater while teaching art to pay the bills. By 1936, he was a player on the national stage, performing from coast to coast. He became a leading Broadway actor for nearly 30 years, in such plays as \"First Stop to Heaven\", \"&lt;a href=\"Home%20of%20the%20Brave%20%28play%29\"&gt;Home of the Brave&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Embezzled Heaven\", and \"Conversation at Midnight\". He made his film debut in a bit part, in 1947, in \"&lt;a href=\"Killer%20at%20Large%20%281947%20film%29\"&gt;Killer at Large&lt;/a&gt;\", but followed that brief appearance the next year with a memorable role in the motion picture \"The Scar\" (also titled \"&lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Triumph\"&gt;Hollow Triumph&lt;/a&gt;\"). His fourth movie saw him acting with &lt;a href=\"John%20Wayne\"&gt;John Wayne&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Wake%20of%20the%20Red%20Witch\"&gt;Wake of the Red Witch&lt;/a&gt;\", in 1948.
