Spajic stated that there were several reasons for his return to Montenegro, but that the main one was the adoption of the disputed Law on Freedom of Religion and that the law shows how many problems have accumulated in the Montenegrin system. He added that until the situation improves, he will not \"move\" from Montenegro and that no investor will believe in a state where an institution such as the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Serbian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;, which has existed for eight centuries and is trusted by most Montenegrin citizens is getting its property seized by the government. During the religious crisis, he participated in lobbying in the United States for interests of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the &lt;a href=\"Serbs%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Serbs of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpajic was nominated for Minister of Finance and Social Welfare on 5 November 2020. Following a parliamentary crisis, Prime Minister Krivokapi\u0107 announced that he had submitted an initiative to the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Parliament of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; to remove Deputy Prime Minister Dritan Abazovi\u0107 and proposed that Spaji\u0107 replaces him as the deputy prime minister."
