    "text": "The United States Custom House, Court House, and Post Office was a federal government building from the 1870s to 1896 in the block bounded by Adams Street, Jackson Boulevard, Dearborn Street, and &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Street%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Clark Street&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Loop\"&gt;Chicago Loop&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nThe supervising architect was James G. Gill. It was completed in 1880, but already occupied by 1879.\nFederal courts meeting in this building were the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois\"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; (1879 to 1894), the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Circuit%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois\"&gt;United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; (1879 to 1894), and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit\"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit&lt;/a&gt; from 1891 to 1894.\nThis federal building was poorly-planned and poorly-built, and by the 1890s was considered dangerous and too small. The building was razed in 1896, and its stone shipped by rail to &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, where it was used to build the &lt;a href=\"Basilica%20of%20St.%20Josaphat\"&gt;Basilica of St. Josaphat&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Federal%20Building\"&gt;Chicago Federal Building&lt;/a&gt; was then built on the same site, and for similar purposes, from 1898 and 1905."
