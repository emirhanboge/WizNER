The construction of the church was completed and consecrated in 1782.

The Poles were defeated due to depletion of ammunition. A shrine and Museum was erected in the village after the war to remember the fighting.\nBetween the years 1975 and 1998 the area administratively belonged to the province of &lt;a href=\"Siedlce\"&gt;Siedlce&lt;/a&gt;."
