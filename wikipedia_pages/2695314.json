    "text": "Deron Leigh Cherry (born September 12, 1959) is an American former professional &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who was a &lt;a href=\"free%20safety\"&gt;free safety&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Chiefs\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) from 1981 to 1991. Cherry was a free safety and &lt;a href=\"Punter%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;punter&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Rutgers%20University\"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt;, intercepting a total of 9 passes over his three seasons, which he returned for 126 yards and two touchdowns. In 1979, he was named the team's MVP. In 1979 and 1980, Cherry earned &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; All-East honors. In 1981, he was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs as a &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; but was released in the final teams cuts. Cherry rejoined the club as a safety, and made his first career &lt;a href=\"interception\"&gt;interception&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nCherry played &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;high school football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Palmyra%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;Palmyra High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Palmyra%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Palmyra, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegarded as one of the best free safeties to have ever played the game, he was a six-time &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; selection from 1983 to 1988, &lt;a href=\"Starting%20lineup\"&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; in five of them in his 11 years with the Chiefs. Few other Chiefs players have been selected to this number of Pro Bowls. He had six 100 &lt;a href=\"Tackle%20%28football%20move%29\"&gt;tackle&lt;/a&gt; seasons in his 11 years as a member of the Chiefs, with a career total of 927 tackles.

He was also a five-time 1st team All-&lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; and two time 2nd team All-AFC selection. Cherry's 15 career &lt;a href=\"fumble\"&gt;fumble&lt;/a&gt; recoveries place him in a three-way tie for the Chiefs record. He ranks third on the Chiefs list of most interceptions, and is only the 26th player in the history of the NFL to reach the 50 interception plateau. In 1987, he was selected to the Chiefs 25 year All-Time Team.\nIn 1987, he won the &lt;a href=\"Byron%20%26quot%3BWhizzer%26quot%3B%20White%20NFL%20Man%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Byron \"Whizzer\" White NFL Man of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to receiving this award, he was the Chiefs NFL Man of the Year selection in 1987. This is the most prestigious award given by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20Players%20Association\"&gt;NFL Players Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is actively involved in several civic organizations, including &lt;a href=\"Special%20Olympics\"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muscular%20Dystrophy%20Association\"&gt;Muscular Dystrophy Association&lt;/a&gt;, Project Warmth, Score 1 for Health, Camp Quality USA, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Negro%20College%20Fund\"&gt;United Negro College Fund&lt;/a&gt;. For the past 25 years, Cherry has hosted his Celebrity Invitational. This tournament has raised over $3 million to support the children of the Kansas City area. Cherry is a frequent guest speaker at civic, charitable, and corporate events throughout the country.\nIn 1995, Cherry became a limited ownership partner in one of the NFL's then-new expansion teams, the &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%20Jaguars\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt;. This made him the first minority owner of an NFL franchise in the league's history. Cherry is also a managing general partner with United Beverage, a local &lt;a href=\"Anheuser-Busch\"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt; distributor.\nIn 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20Football%20Researchers%20Association\"&gt;Professional Football Researchers Association&lt;/a&gt; named Cherry to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2019 "
