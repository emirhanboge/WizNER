    "text": "The siege of Klis or Battle of Klis (, ) was a siege of &lt;a href=\"Klis%20Fortress\"&gt;Klis Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28Habsburg%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Croatia&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. The siege of the fortress, which lasted for more than two decades, and the final battle near &lt;a href=\"Klis\"&gt;Klis&lt;/a&gt; in 1537, were fought as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg%20wars\"&gt;Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars&lt;/a&gt; between the defending Croatian\u2013Habsburg forces under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; feudal lord &lt;a href=\"Petar%20Kru%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, and the attacking &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman army&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; general &lt;a href=\"Murat-beg%20Tardi%C4%87\"&gt;Murat-beg Tardi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the decisive Ottoman victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Krbava%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Krbava Field&lt;/a&gt; in 1493, and especially after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Moh%C3%A1cs\"&gt;Battle of Moh\u00e1cs&lt;/a&gt; in 1526, the &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croats&lt;/a&gt; continued defending themselves against the Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman conquest during the early years of the 16th century prompted the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Uskoks\"&gt;Uskoks&lt;/a&gt;, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107, also called \"Prince of Klis\". As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the Ottoman attacks.\nAfter the final battle, which resulted in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107's death, the Klis defenders, who were lacking in water supplies, finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom on 12 March 1537. Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of &lt;a href=\"Senj\"&gt;Senj&lt;/a&gt;, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or &lt;a href=\"sanjak\"&gt;sanjak&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Klis\"&gt;Sanjak of Klis&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20Eyalet\"&gt;Bosnia Eyalet&lt;/a&gt;, and would remain so for a century.\nBackground.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bosnia\"&gt;Kingdom of Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; hands in 1463, the southern and central parts of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28medieval%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Croatia&lt;/a&gt; remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. The decisive Ottoman victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Krbava%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Krbava Field&lt;/a&gt; in 1493 shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croats&lt;/a&gt; from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.\nOn 29 August 1526, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Moh%C3%A1cs\"&gt;Battle of Moh\u00e1cs&lt;/a&gt;, the Christian forces led by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20II%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;King Louis II&lt;/a&gt; were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; forces led by Sultan &lt;a href=\"Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent\"&gt;Suleiman the Magnificent&lt;/a&gt;. Louis was killed in the battle, which resulted in the end of the independent &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Kingdom of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; as he died without an heir. Both the Kingdoms of Hungary and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28Habsburg%29\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the House of Habsburg, the brother of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor%20Charles%20V\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor Charles V&lt;/a&gt; and a future Holy Roman Emperor himself, married the sister of Louis II and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.\nOwing to its location, Klis Fortress was an important defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split, from Ottoman-held Bosnia. The Croat feudal lord &lt;a href=\"Petar%20Kru%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt; gathered together a garrison composed of Croat refugees, who used the base at Klis both to hold the Ottomans at bay, and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping. Although nominally accepting the sovereignty of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand, who obtained the Croatian crown in 1527, Kru\u017ei\u0107 and his freebooting &lt;a href=\"Uskoks\"&gt;Uskoks&lt;/a&gt; were a law unto themselves.\nSiege.\nFailed attempts.\nFrom 1513, &lt;a href=\"Petar%20Kru%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was one of the commanding officers of &lt;a href=\"Klis%20Fortress\"&gt;Klis Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis Fortress on several occasions. The first major attempt was by &lt;a href=\"Skender-beg%20Ornosovi%C4%87\"&gt;Skender-beg Ornosovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in 1515. The Ottomans captured Klis, a village just below the fortress bearing the same name, but the garrison in the fortress above held. Kru\u017ei\u0107 was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28land%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of the Klis Fortress by the &lt;a href=\"ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Petar%20Berislavi%C4%87\"&gt;Petar Berislavi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in 1520. The second major attempt was in 1520, and a year later another attempt was made by &lt;a href=\"Makut-pa%C5%A1a\"&gt;Makut-pa\u0161a&lt;/a&gt;, with additional 2,000 infantry, 50 horsemen, and siege equipment. Another unsuccessful attempt was made in 1522, by &lt;a href=\"Hasan-pa%C5%A1a\"&gt;Hasan-pa\u0161a&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mostar\"&gt;Mostar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mehmed-beg%20Mihalbegovi%C4%87\"&gt;Mehmed-beg Mihalbegovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, Mihalbegovi\u0107 made another attempt at a siege with 3,000 men, but failed again. During 1523, Klis Fortress was again under attack by the Sultan's army. Attempts were also made by &lt;a href=\"Gazi%20Husrev-beg\"&gt;Gazi Husrev-beg&lt;/a&gt; in 1526 and 1528, and later in 1531 and 1532.\nIn 1534, the Ottomans under Mihalbegovi\u0107 laid a months-long siege with a constant concentrated cannonade. Ferdinand urged the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; to send ships to relieve the Ottoman siege. Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege, Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no assistance in the defense of the fortress. In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of the fortress.\nWhen a large Ottoman force threatened the fortress, Kru\u017ei\u0107 appealed to Ferdinand for help, but the Emperor's attention was diverted by an Ottoman attack in &lt;a href=\"Slavonia\"&gt;Slavonia&lt;/a&gt;. Kru\u017ei\u0107 led the defense of Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they repeatedly hurled armies against the fortress. No troops from the Hungarian king arrived, as they were slaughtered by the Ottomans at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Moh%C3%A1cs\"&gt;Battle of Moh\u00e1cs&lt;/a&gt; in 1526, and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Venetians&lt;/a&gt; baulked at sending any help. Only the pope was willing to provide some men and money.\nFinal battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20III\"&gt;Pope Paul III&lt;/a&gt; claimed some rights in Klis, and in September 1536, there was talk in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; of strengthening the defenses of the fortress. The Pope notified &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt; that he was willing to share the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis. Ferdinand did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress, when the Ottomans again laid siege to it. Ferdinand recruited men from &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in the Habsburg lands, and the Pope sent soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Ancona\"&gt;Ancona&lt;/a&gt;. There were about 3,000 infantry in the reinforcements, which made a sizeable relief force, that were commanded by Petar Kru\u017ei\u0107, &lt;a href=\"Niccolo%20dalla%20Torre\"&gt;Niccolo dalla Torre&lt;/a&gt;, and a papal commissioner &lt;a href=\"Jacomo%20Dalmoro%20d%27Arbe\"&gt;Jacomo Dalmoro d'Arbe&lt;/a&gt;. On 9 March 1537 they disembarked near Klis, at a place called S. Girolamo, with fourteen pieces of artillery. After &lt;a href=\"Pargal%C4%B1%20Ibrahim%20Pasha\"&gt;Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Suleiman sent 8,000 men under the command of &lt;a href=\"Murat-beg%20Tardi%C4%87\"&gt;Murat-beg Tardi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (Amurat Vaivoda), a Croatian who had been born in &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0ibenik\"&gt;\u0160ibenik&lt;/a&gt;, to go and lay siege to Klis fortress (\"Clissa\"), and fight against Kru\u017ei\u0107. An initial encounter of the Christian relief force with the Ottomans was indecisive, but, on 12 March they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Ottomans.\nThe attempts to relieve the citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their attempts to re-board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kru\u017ei\u0107 himself\u00a0\u2013 who had left the fortress to make contact with the reinforcements\u00a0- was captured and executed; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kru\u017ei\u0107's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the &lt;a href=\"Uskoci\"&gt;Uskoci&lt;/a&gt; retreated to the city of &lt;a href=\"Senj\"&gt;Senj&lt;/a&gt;, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.\nAftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Ottoman wars in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Klis Fortress became an administrative centre or &lt;a href=\"sanjak\"&gt;sanjak&lt;/a&gt; (Kilis Sanca\u011f\u0131) of the &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20Eyalet\"&gt;Bosnia Eyalet&lt;/a&gt;, and would remain so for a century. As the first Sanjak-Beg of Klis, &lt;a href=\"Murat-beg%20Tardi%C4%87\"&gt;Murat-beg Tardi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; built a notable mosque inside the &lt;a href=\"Klis%20Fortress\"&gt;Klis Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, the Ottoman forces took &lt;a href=\"Vrana%20%28town%29\"&gt;Vrana&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Nadin\"&gt;Nadin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peru%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;Peru\u0161i\u0107&lt;/a&gt; fell in 1538.\nMonths after the fall of Klis, the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281537%E2%80%931540%29\"&gt;Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1537-1540&lt;/a&gt; started, and in that war, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281570%E2%80%931573%29\"&gt;Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1570-1573&lt;/a&gt;, the Ottomans took much of the &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt;n hinterland near &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0ibenik\"&gt;\u0160ibenik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zadar\"&gt;Zadar&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 April 1596, &lt;a href=\"Split%2C%20Croatia\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt; noblemen Ivan Alberti and Nikola Cindro, along with Uskoci, Polji\u010dani, and Ka\u0161telani irregulars, organized a liberation of Klis. Assisted by dissident elements of the Ottoman garrison, they succeeded. Mustafa-beg responded by bringing more than 10,000 soldiers under the fortress. General &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Lenkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Ivan Lenkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, leading 1,000 Uskoci, came in relief of the 1,500 Klis defenders. During the battle, Ivan Lenkovi\u0107 and his men retreated after he was wounded in battle, and the fortress was lost to the Ottomans on 31 May. Nevertheless, this temporary relief resounded in Europe and among the local population.\nThe Venetians fought for decades before they finally managed to re-take Klis. During the &lt;a href=\"Cretan%20War%20%281645%E2%80%931669%29\"&gt;Cretan War of 1645-1669&lt;/a&gt;, the Venetians in Dalmatia enjoyed the support of the local population, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Morlachs\"&gt;Morlachs&lt;/a&gt; (Morlacchi). Venetian commander &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20Foscolo\"&gt;Leonardo Foscolo&lt;/a&gt; seized several forts, retook &lt;a href=\"Novigrad%2C%20Zadar%20County\"&gt;Novigrad&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily captured the &lt;a href=\"Knin%20Fortress\"&gt;Knin Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and managed to compel the garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender."
