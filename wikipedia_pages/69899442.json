    "text": "Ali Shah, known by the &lt;a href=\"laqab\"&gt;regnal name&lt;/a&gt; al-Mustansir Billah II (; 1480-1463/4), was the 32nd &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Isma%27ili%20imams\"&gt;imam&lt;/a&gt; of the Qasim-Shahi branch of the &lt;a href=\"Nizari%20Isma%27ilism\"&gt;Nizari Isma'ili&lt;/a&gt; community. His reign initiated the &lt;a href=\"Anjudan\"&gt;Anjudan&lt;/a&gt; period of Nizari history, which was marked by a revival of Nizari teachings.\nBackground.\nThe history of &lt;a href=\"Nizari%20Isma%27ilism\"&gt;Nizari Isma'ilism&lt;/a&gt; in the centuries following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Nizari%20Isma%27ili%20state\"&gt;Nizari Isma'ili state&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20Empire\"&gt;Mongol Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1256 is particularly obscure, both due to lack of scholarly attention and due to lack of reliable sources, as the Nizari faithful were left scattered and without central leadership and often had to dissimulate their true faith due to persecution by &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; rulers. During the 14th century, moreover, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Isma%27ili%20imams\"&gt;line of succession&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imamate%20in%20Nizari%20doctrine\"&gt;imamate&lt;/a&gt; split into two rival factions, the Muhammad-Shahi and Qasim-Shahi lines, of which the former initially gained the allegiance of the majority of the Nizari communities and were more active in the historical record. The Qasim-Shahi line, on the other hand, is shrouded in obscurity, and even their first imams are known almost only as names, with few reliable dates or information about their lives. \nLife.\nAli Shah, known by the &lt;a href=\"laqab\"&gt;regnal name&lt;/a&gt; al-Mustansir Billah II, hearkening back to the 11th-century &lt;a href=\"Fatimid\"&gt;Fatimid&lt;/a&gt; caliph &lt;a href=\"Al-Mustansir%20Billah\"&gt;of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, was the son of the third Qasim-Shahi imam (and 31st overall), Muhammad ibn Islam Shah ibn Qasim Shah, and succeeded his father as imam . In a time when &lt;a href=\"Shi%27a\"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; beliefs were gaining ground in Iran, the Nizaris often hid behind the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Sufism\"&gt;Sufism&lt;/a&gt;, and al-Mustansir was known by the Sufi name Shah Qalandar. \nHe was the first of his line known to have settled in the village of &lt;a href=\"Anjudan\"&gt;Anjudan&lt;/a&gt; in central Iran, which already during the late 14th century appears to have been a significant Qasim-Shahi centre, which was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; in 1393. This move began a period of revival of the Nizari traditions under the Qasim-Shahi line, both in a reinvigoration of their missionary activity as well as a renewed literary output of the sect. Al-Mustansir sent missionaries (s) to places as far as what is now &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. \nAl-Mustansir died in 1480, and was buried in an octagonal mausoleum, still known by the locals as that of Shah Qalandar. He was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Salam%20Shah\"&gt;Abd al-Salam Shah&lt;/a&gt;. It was during the latter's rule that al-Mustansir's sermons were compiled into a book, the ('Admonitions on Spiritual Chivalry')."
