    "text": "Beverwijk () is a municipality and a city in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt;. The town is located about northwest of &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Randstad\"&gt;Randstad&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area, north of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Canal\"&gt;North Sea Canal&lt;/a&gt; very close to the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast. A railway tunnel and two motorway tunnels cross the canal between Beverwijk and the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Haarlem\"&gt;Haarlem&lt;/a&gt; on the south bank.\nAround 1640, a town called &lt;a href=\"Beverwyck\"&gt;Beverwyck&lt;/a&gt; was founded in the Dutch colony of &lt;a href=\"New%20Netherland\"&gt;New Netherland&lt;/a&gt;. That town's modern name is &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation centres.\nThe municipality of Beverwijk consists of two cores, Beverwijk proper and &lt;a href=\"Wijk%20aan%20Zee\"&gt;Wijk aan Zee&lt;/a&gt;, to the west, right on the coast.\nHistory.\nThe name Beverwijk comes from \"Bedevaartswijk\", meaning \"pilgrimage neighbourhood\". The town formed at the Saint Agatha Church which was a pilgrimage location in the Middle Ages. Allegedly &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Agatha of Sicily&lt;/a&gt; appeared there in the 9th century to a virgin from &lt;a href=\"Velsen\"&gt;Velsen&lt;/a&gt; who was fleeing from the Count of Kennemerland.\nIn 1276 Beverwijk was granted market rights by &lt;a href=\"Floris%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Holland\"&gt;Floris V&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1298 it was granted &lt;a href=\"City%20rights%20in%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;city rights&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"John%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Holland\"&gt;John I&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Holland\"&gt;Counts of Holland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 17th century wealthy merchants from Amsterdam built their estates, such as \"Huize Akerendam\", \"Huize Westerhout\", and \"Huize Scheijbeeck\", in the scenic dunes surrounding Beverwijk.\nPrior to the reclamation of the &lt;a href=\"IJ%20%28Amsterdam%29\"&gt;IJ Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the narrowest point in the North Holland peninsula was at Beverwijk. Therefore, a defensive line was built there in 1800 following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Castricum\"&gt;Battle of Castricum&lt;/a&gt; in 1799.\nIn 1944, during the Second World War, the Germans conducted a house-to-house raid in Beverwijk and &lt;a href=\"Velsen-Noord\"&gt;Velsen-Noord&lt;/a&gt;, seizing nearly 500 persons as hostages to force the murderers of three collaborators to surrender themselves. In all, 63 of them never returned.\nAround 1977, the first furniture stores opened along the Parallel Road, forming the first \"furniture boulevard\" in the Netherlands. By 1981, 10 businesses had been established there. South of the furniture boulevard, the &lt;a href=\"Beverwijk%20Bazaar\"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1980.\nOn March 23, 1997, Beverwijk was the location of a clash of two &lt;a href=\"football%20firm\"&gt;football firm&lt;/a&gt;s. Supporters of the Dutch &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Ajax%20Amsterdam\"&gt;AFC Ajax&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord\"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt; supporters in what has come to be known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Beverwijk\"&gt;Battle of Beverwijk&lt;/a&gt;\". During this incident, one Ajax supporter was beaten to death.\nSince 1997, Special Needs Judo Foundation has organised its annual OBG (Open Beverwijk G-judo) tournament in Sporthal De Walvis, featuring over 1000 special needs judoka from all over the world. The tournament takes place every year in April.\nLocal government.\nThe municipal council of Beverwijk consists of 27 seats, which are divided as follows:"
