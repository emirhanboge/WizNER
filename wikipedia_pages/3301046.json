After her death, the Strauss family allowed it to be performed in public for the first time by &lt;a href=\"Kiri%20te%20Kanawa\"&gt;Kiri te Kanawa&lt;/a&gt;, who has also recorded it.\nJeritza made a number of 78-rpm recordings which testify to the high quality of her voice. Many of these recordings have been released on CD."
