However by June 2012, when the draw was made for the tournament, only seven had confirmed their participation. These were &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamaica%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namibia%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; where among the countries that had dropped out. Before the tournament started, a late entry by &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; saw the number of participants increase to eight. It was initially planned that &lt;a href=\"Colleges%20and%20Universities%20Sports%20Association%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; would send an All-Ireland team, featuring players from both Northern Ireland and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. However no players from the Republic were selected for the final squad. As a result, it was a Northern Ireland team, in effect, that competed in the tournament. \nFormat.\nWhen there was just seven teams due to participate, it was planned for all seven teams to play each other once in a group stage. The top four teams would then qualify for the semi-finals. However with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20national%20netball%20team\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; it was decided to split the eight teams into two groups of four. All eight teams qualified for the quarter-finals, with the final group tables deciding the quarter-final draw. "
