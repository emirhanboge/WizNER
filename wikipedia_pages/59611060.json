The four clubs competing in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;) qualifying rounds were given a bye through to the second round. The 40 teams competing in the group stage consisted of the other eight teams that competed in the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20Premiership\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, and all of the teams that competed in the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20League%20Two\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish League Two&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 Highland Football League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 Lowland Football League&lt;/a&gt; champions.\nThe winners of each of the eight groups, as well as the four best runners-up progressed to the second round (last 16), which includes the four UEFA qualifying clubs. At this stage, the competition reverts to the traditional &lt;a href=\"Single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;knock-out&lt;/a&gt; format. The four group winners with the highest points total and the clubs entering at this stage are seeded, with the four group winners with the lowest points unseeded along with the four best runners-up.\nBonus point system.\nIn December 2015, the SPFL announced that alongside the new group stage format, a bonus point system would be introduced to provide greater excitement and increase the number of meaningful games at this stage. The traditional point system of awarding three points for a win and one point for a draw is used, however, for each group stage match that finishes in a draw, a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; takes place, with the winner being awarded a bonus point.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage was made up of eight teams from the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20Premiership\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, and all ten teams from each of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Scottish%20League%20Two\"&gt;2018\u201319 Scottish League Two&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the winners of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 Highland Football League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Lowland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 Lowland Football League&lt;/a&gt;.
