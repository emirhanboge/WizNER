    "text": "Macroom (; ) is a &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;market town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Cork\"&gt;County Cork&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland, located in the valley of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Sullane\"&gt;River Sullane&lt;/a&gt;, halfway between &lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28city%29\"&gt;Cork city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Killarney\"&gt;Killarney&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish language&lt;/a&gt; name may translate as \"meeting place of followers of the god &lt;a href=\"Crom%20Cruach\"&gt;Crom&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"crooked oak\", the latter a reference to a large oak tree that apparently grew in the town-square during the reign of &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;King John&lt;/a&gt;. Its population has grown and receded over the centuries as it went through periods of war, famine and &lt;a href=\"workhouse\"&gt;workhouse&lt;/a&gt;s, forced emigration and intermittent prosperity. The 2011 census gave an urban population of 3,879 people, while the 2016 census recorded 3,765 people.\nMacroom began as a meeting place for the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Munster\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt;. It is first mentioned is in 6th-century records, and the immediate area hosted a major battle involving the Irish king &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Boru\"&gt;Brian Boru&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"middle%20ages\"&gt;middle ages&lt;/a&gt;, the town was invaded by a succession of warring clans, including the Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan families. In the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt; the MacCarthy's took control and later the area found prosperity via milling. The MacCarthys built a series of &lt;a href=\"tower%20house\"&gt;tower house&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Carrigaphooca%20Castle\"&gt;some of which&lt;/a&gt; survive. The family lost influence during the &lt;a href=\"Williamite%20War%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Williamite wars&lt;/a&gt; of the 1690s, after which authority over the town castle waxed and waned between the MacCarthys and a number of English families. In the 17th century, Macroom became a central point of conflict in the &lt;a href=\"Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Cromwellian conquest of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe population fell in the 1840s during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Great Famine&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence can be found in the former &lt;a href=\"workhouse\"&gt;workhouse&lt;/a&gt;, now the district hospital at the north side of New Street, and the mass graveyard to the west, near &lt;a href=\"Clondrohid\"&gt;Clondrohid&lt;/a&gt;. During the late 18th and early 19th century, a number of &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish\"&gt;Anglo-Irish&lt;/a&gt; families, and a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Massey%20family\"&gt;Massey family&lt;/a&gt;, settled in the area. Many of their &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20Irish%20country%20houses%20%281919%E2%80%931923%29\"&gt;estate houses were burned&lt;/a&gt; in the period around the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Irish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; as the town was caught the turmoil of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; activity.\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Macroom hosted the Mountain Dew Rock festival, with lineups that included &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Gallagher\"&gt;Rory Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thin%20Lizzy\"&gt;Thin Lizzy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Van%20Morrison\"&gt;Van Morrison&lt;/a&gt;. Today the town is an economic hub for the mid west Cork region, and the location of a &lt;a href=\"Danone\"&gt;Danone&lt;/a&gt; milk processing factory, which dries and cans &lt;a href=\"infant%20formula\"&gt;infant formula&lt;/a&gt; from milk supplied by local dairy farmers. Until the 1950s, New Street was the town's economic hub, and contained many small retail outlets.\nHistory.\nNeolithic.\nEvidence of pre-history human activity in the Macroom area survives in the many &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; burial monuments; the area is unusually rich with &lt;a href=\"Glantane%20East\"&gt;standing stones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knocknakilla%20megalithic%20complex\"&gt;dolmen&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Carrigagulla\"&gt;stone circle&lt;/a&gt;s. Later, in the early &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Dark%20Age\"&gt;dark ages&lt;/a&gt;, Macroom seems to have been a centre for &lt;a href=\"Bardic\"&gt;Bardic&lt;/a&gt; conventions and a base for the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s of Munster. The first historical reference to Macroom dates from the 6th century, when the townland was known as Achad Dorbchon and held within the kingdom of Muscraighe Mitine.\nThe &lt;a href=\"E%C3%B3ganachta\"&gt;E\u00f3ganachta&lt;/a&gt; were then the dominant clan of &lt;a href=\"Munster\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; and held kingdoms from Muscraighe Mitine to the midlands town of &lt;a href=\"Birr%2C%20County%20Offaly\"&gt;Birr&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, they were replaced by the U\u00ed Floinn, who commissioned a castle in Macroom so as to establish &lt;a href=\"E%C3%B3ganacht%20Raithlind\"&gt;Raithleann&lt;/a&gt; as capital of &lt;a href=\"Muskerry\"&gt;Muskerry&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiddle ages.\nMuscraighe Mitine underwent three invasions during the 13th century. The Murcheatach U\u00ed Briain and Richard de Cogan arrived in 1201 and 1207 respectively; the MacCarthys became the dominant and most powerful family and held &lt;a href=\"Macroom%20Castle\"&gt;Macroom Castle&lt;/a&gt; until the mid-17th century. \nFrom the 14th century, Macroom became the capital of the Barony of Muskerry and the centre for trade, burial and religious worship. It was one of the earliest Irish milling centres, and from the end of the 16th century the town grew from a village to a functionally diverse urban centre. The locality grew outwards from the castle. The MacCarthys established the town as a centre for markets and fairs, and in 1620 a market house was built to the east of and facing the castle. The family introduced a &lt;a href=\"Plantation%20%28settlement%20or%20colony%29\"&gt;plantation&lt;/a&gt; scheme which aimed to attract new agriculture and industrial techniques and methods to the area.\nModern period.\nBy the mid-17th century English families owned approximately one-third of the town in value terms. The Protestant families introduced butter making, a labour-intensive industry. A 1750 &lt;a href=\"tenement\"&gt;tenement&lt;/a&gt; list details 134 buildings and 300 families, with a population ratio of 6 to 1 between Catholic and Protestants. The town had developed from a locality of mud cabins in the early 1660s to a linear shaped urban settlement of mainly &lt;a href=\"thatch\"&gt;thatch&lt;/a&gt;ed cabins, which were later replaced by solid cottages following a campaign by the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Land%20and%20Labour%20Association\"&gt;Irish Land and Labour Association&lt;/a&gt; (ILLA). Macroom Castle was for a period controlled by &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Sir%20William%20Penn\"&gt;Admiral Sir William Penn&lt;/a&gt;, a British Admiral and father of &lt;a href=\"William%20Penn\"&gt;William Penn&lt;/a&gt;, after whom the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; is named.\nBattle of Macroom.\nThe 1650 battle of Macroom was waged as part of the &lt;a href=\"Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Cromwellian conquest of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, when the English Parliamentarian force, lead by Roger Boyle, defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche. Bishop &lt;a href=\"Boetius%20MacEgan\"&gt;Boetius MacEgan&lt;/a&gt;, acting on behalf of the MacCarthys, failed to hold the castle. He was taken prisoner by the Cromwellian forces and hanged at &lt;a href=\"Carrigadrohid\"&gt;Carrigadrohid&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of Independence.\nMacroom was the main base in Cork for the British &lt;a href=\"Auxiliary%20Division\"&gt;Auxiliary Division&lt;/a&gt; during the 1919\u20131921 &lt;a href=\"Irish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Irish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; was highly active in the county, especially in the areas around Macroom, &lt;a href=\"Bandon%2C%20County%20Cork\"&gt;Bandon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmanway\"&gt;Dunmanway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary\"&gt;Royal Irish Constabulary&lt;/a&gt; police in the town described the area as \"practically in a state of war\". After a series of burnings of local police barracks and courthouses a curfew was imposed on the town, with a ban on public meetings and market fairs. A local IRA member wrote of a \"hinterland unpoliced and unwatched\". The local police felt they had lost control and the Auxiliaries were called to intervene. The townspeople treated army personnel with hostility, and there were instances of patrols being stoned. The Brits were embroiled in a guerrilla battle in the &lt;a href=\"Muskerry\"&gt;Muskerry&lt;/a&gt; hills, coming under fire from the Ballyvourney IRA cell, and lost three men \u2013 two of them officers \u2013 in one attack.\nIn 1920 at &lt;a href=\"Kilmichael%2C%20County%20Cork\"&gt;Kilmichael&lt;/a&gt;, on the road between Macroom and Dunmanway, 17 members of the Macroom Auxiliary \"C Company\" &lt;a href=\"Kilmichael%20Ambush\"&gt;were ambushed and killed&lt;/a&gt; by a local IRA cell led by the prominent general &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Barry%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;Tom Barry&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the attack, the British military were given the power to execute anyone found carrying arms and ammunition, to search houses, impose curfews, try suspects in military rather than civilian courts and to intern suspects without trial. On 11 December, in reprisal, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20of%20Cork\"&gt;centre of Cork city was burned&lt;/a&gt; by Auxiliaries, British soldiers and &lt;a href=\"Black%20and%20Tans\"&gt;Black and Tans&lt;/a&gt;.\nMacroom Castle was burned out on five separate occasions; the last occasion was on 18 August 1922 following the evacuation of British Auxiliaries from the town. Members of anti-treaty forces, including &lt;a href=\"Erskine%20Childers%20%28author%29\"&gt;Erskine Childers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20O%27Connor\"&gt;Frank O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, retreated from Cork City to Macroom, burning the castle before leaving.\nMount Massey which is now ruined, was the 18th and 19th century home of the members of the &lt;a href=\"Massey%20family\"&gt;Massey family&lt;/a&gt;, and is located north by Kilnagurteen and gave the townland of Masseytown its name. The family were major landowners with land covering 13,363 acres, extending from Clondrohid to Drishane. During the 19th century the family tried to temper growing nationalism sentiment by sponsoring the local town fair. Later their home and estate was sieged and burned in December 1920 by Republicans during the War of Independence.\nThe revolutionary soldier and politician &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Collins%20%28Irish%20leader%29\"&gt;Michael Collins&lt;/a&gt; was killed in 1922 in an ambush near &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9al%20na%20Bl%C3%A1th\"&gt;B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Olivia%20Charlotte%20Guinness%2C%20Baroness%20Ardilaun\"&gt;Lady Olivia Ardilaun&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the McCarthys, and widow of &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Guinness%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ardilaun\"&gt;Lord Ardilaun&lt;/a&gt;, sold the castle &lt;a href=\"demesne\"&gt;demesne&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 to a group of local businessmen, which they put in trust for the town.\nGeography and climate.\nMacroom was built on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Sullane\"&gt;River Sullane&lt;/a&gt;, a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Lee%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;River Lee&lt;/a&gt;. Its hinterland lies on a valley at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Boggeragh%20Mountains\"&gt;Boggeragh Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The town stretches for about and largely consists of two long streets, Main Street and New Street, divided by the Ten Arch Bridge, which also leads off to the suburb of Massey Town, further towards the village of &lt;a href=\"Ballinagree\"&gt;Ballinagree&lt;/a&gt; and the Boggeragh Mountains.\nLike the rest of Ireland, the climate is &lt;a href=\"Oceanic%20climate\"&gt;temperate maritime&lt;/a&gt;, very even and heavily influenced by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Atlantic%20Current\"&gt;North Atlantic Current&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in mild winters and cool summers. Weather in Macroom is mild, usually warm, temperate and humid, with significant rainfall throughout the year, averaging at 1164\u00a0mm. Rain falls on average around 21 days of each month, peaking in December (average 24 days), and falling off slightly in June (average 21 days). Snow is uncommon; it tends to fall in January or February, for an average of 2\u20133 days per year. Wind speeds vary from c 80\u00a0km/hr avg in winter, to 50\u201352 in summer. The mean temperature is 10.1\u00a0\u00b0C.\nEconomy.\nThe economy is primarily agricultural, with local dairy farmers being members of the &lt;a href=\"Dairygold\"&gt;Dairygold&lt;/a&gt; co-operative. Their milk is dried or evaporated in &lt;a href=\"Mitchelstown\"&gt;Mitchelstown&lt;/a&gt; as skim milk or &lt;a href=\"whey%20concentrate\"&gt;whey concentrate&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually supplied to the local &lt;a href=\"Danone\"&gt;Danone&lt;/a&gt; plant, which produces infant formula for a worldwide market.\nTourism.\nTourist attractions include the town centre, an 18-hole golf course, and the Castle Grounds, with fishing and golfing grounds. The town's surroundings contain large amounts of megalithic monuments, early Christian holy wells, churches and sacred sites associated with ancient visionaries and healers. Mushera Mountain is located a few kilometres to the north of the town, near Millstreet Country Park. It contains the ancient Saint John's Well. &lt;a href=\"Carrigaphooca%20Castle\"&gt;Carrigaphooca Castle&lt;/a&gt; a tower house 6\u00a0km west of the town no longer accessible to the public.\nThe Castle Arch, the centerpiece of the old castle grounds, admits walkers to the &lt;a href=\"demesne\"&gt;demesne&lt;/a&gt; parklands. It is held in trust to, and in the possession of the people of Macroom. Its large park contains riverside walks among mature oak and beech trees.\nThe Gearagh.\nThe Gearagh is a national nature reserve on an inland delta, is located south of Macroom. It comprises a series of small islands, separated by &lt;a href=\"anastomosis\"&gt;anastomosing&lt;/a&gt;, mostly flat, river channels or streams, and is bounded by Toon Bridge, Illaunmore, and Anahala Bridge. The area is thought to have been wooded since the end of the last Ice Age c. 8,000 bc. The alluvial woodland extended as far as the Lee Bridge, and consisted of a large number of mature oak and ash trees.\nThe reserve was gutted in 1954 when the Lee &lt;a href=\"Hydroelectricity\"&gt;hydro-electric&lt;/a&gt; scheme led to extensive tree-felling and flooding. Now submerged houses are visible from the area around Two Mile Bridge. The scheme resulted in the loss of sixty percent of the former oak woodland. Today, the Gearagh is of interest and importance due to its rich and rare diversity of wildlife, and represents the only extant extensive &lt;a href=\"Alluvium\"&gt;alluvial&lt;/a&gt; woodland in Western Europe.\nThe Gearagh is primarily of interest and importance due to its rich and rare diversity of wildlife, and it represents the only extant extensive alluvial woodland in Western Europe. It hosts numerous rare plant species including &lt;a href=\"Caltha%20palustris\"&gt;marsh marigold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Filipendula%20ulmaria\"&gt;meadowsweet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solanaceae\"&gt;nightshade&lt;/a&gt;, and 62 species of &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"liverwort\"&gt;liverwort&lt;/a&gt;. While oak and ash trees once pre-dominated, today there are a number of &lt;a href=\"willow\"&gt;willow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"alder\"&gt;alder&lt;/a&gt; trees on the higher islands and inlets. It hosts a large diversity of birds and wildfowl and attracts both summer and winter migrants. Examples include &lt;a href=\"mallards\"&gt;mallards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wigeon\"&gt;wigeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greylag%20geese\"&gt;Greylag geese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"coots\"&gt;coots&lt;/a&gt;. It also hosts &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20salmon\"&gt;Atlantic salmon&lt;/a&gt; and the near extinct &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20pearl%20mussel\"&gt;freshwater pearl mussel&lt;/a&gt;. The area is protected under the international &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday the Gearagh comprises wide but shallow water enclosing a series of small islands separated by &lt;a href=\"anastomosis\"&gt;anastomosing&lt;/a&gt;, mostly flat, river streams. It remains an area of outstanding natural beauty, with a diverse ecological system and wide variety of plants, birds and fish, including &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20pearl%20mussel\"&gt;freshwater pearl mussel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20salmon\"&gt;Atlantic salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"whooper%20swan\"&gt;whooper swan&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kingfisher\"&gt;kingfisher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCarrigaphooca Castle.\nCarrigaphooca Castle is a ruined five storey rectangular &lt;a href=\"tower%20house\"&gt;tower house&lt;/a&gt; situated on a steep-sided rock overlooking the &lt;a href=\"River%20Sullane\"&gt;River Sullane&lt;/a&gt;. It is located 6\u00a0km west of Macroom, in an area once known as Gleann na n-Dearg (\"Valley of the Reds\"). The tower dominates the landscape of Lissacresig (\"Fairyland\") in &lt;a href=\"Clondrohid\"&gt;Clondrohid&lt;/a&gt;, and Lower Shanballyshane, in &lt;a href=\"Kilnamartyra\"&gt;Kilnamartyra&lt;/a&gt;. Carrigaphooca is made of &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; and was built as a defensive tower by &lt;a href=\"MacCarthy\"&gt;MacCarthy clan member&lt;/a&gt; Donal MacCarthy of Drishane c. 1336\u201351. Cormac Teige McCarthy, the Lord of &lt;a href=\"Blarney%20Castle\"&gt;Blarney&lt;/a&gt; took refuge in the tower after he had sided with the Irish during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Kinsale\"&gt;Siege of Kinsale&lt;/a&gt; in 1601. He stayed there until he was forgiven by &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; after he had written a personal letter of apology to her. In 1602, the castle was attacked and taken by &lt;a href=\"Donal%20Cam%20O%27Sullivan%20Beare\"&gt;Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare&lt;/a&gt; and another member of the extended McCarthy family. After a protracted &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;, their forces broke through the outer wall and burned the timber door at the north face entrance. The defenders surrendered and were allowed to go free.\nCarrigaphooca is positioned in an area rich with neolithic monuments; &lt;a href=\"Carrigaphooca%20Stone%20Circle\"&gt;a stone circle&lt;/a&gt; lies two fields to the east. The tower is located on private property, and no longer accessible to the public, although it is owned by the state and maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Public%20Works\"&gt;Office of Public Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nMountain Dew festival.\nFrom 1976 to 1982 Macroom hosted the annual Mountain Dew festival, organised by young local business people. The festivals attracted up to 20,000 attendees each year. It was the first of its kind for Ireland, and was intended to reinvigorate a town that was then stagnant economically. According to one of the organisers, Martin Fitzgerald, \"The town needed a bit of shake rattle and roll to tempt not just international investors but Irish people to rest there a bit long...a rock concert fitted the bill\". Line ups included &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Gallagher\"&gt;Rory Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Lynott\"&gt;Phil Lynott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Costello\"&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Van%20Morrison\"&gt;Van Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marianne%20Faithfull\"&gt;Marianne Faithfull&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horslips\"&gt;Horslips&lt;/a&gt;, and was attended by &lt;a href=\"John%20Lydon\"&gt;John Lydon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt;.\nChurches.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the urban population of 3,879 included 3,535 people identifying as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;. The town's Catholic church, dedicated to St. Coleman, was built in 1841. It was remodeled in 1893, based on a design by Dominic Coakley.\nMacroom's &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; building was constructed in 1823 on foot of a loan of \u00a31000 from the Board of Fruits. The building is now derelict, although the graveyard is still in use. The remains of a &lt;a href=\"Thatching\"&gt;thatched&lt;/a&gt;-chapel lies to the west of the town, on Lackaduduv mountain. A rare surviving form, the remnants are known locally as \"Carrignaspirroge Chapel\".\nTransport.\nMacroom is on the &lt;a href=\"National%20primary%20road\"&gt;national primary route&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N22%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N22&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 38\u00a0km from &lt;a href=\"Cork%20city\"&gt;Cork city&lt;/a&gt; and 48\u00a0km from Killarney. The nearest airport is &lt;a href=\"Cork%20Airport\"&gt;Cork Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nA railway ran between the town and Cork city from 1866 to 1953, terminating in the mart grounds. By 1890 there were five services each way on week days and two on Sundays, with the running time taking just over an hour. &lt;a href=\"Macroom%20railway%20station\"&gt;Macroom railway station&lt;/a&gt; opened on 12 May 1866; it closed for passenger traffic on 1 July 1935 and for goods traffic on 10 March 1947, and was finally closed on 1 December 1953.\nEducation.\nThe town has two &lt;a href=\"Primary%20school\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary&lt;/a&gt; schools; a &lt;a href=\"Lasallian%20educational%20institutions\"&gt;De La Salle&lt;/a&gt; for boys, the St. Mary's Secondary School Convent of Mercy for girls, and McEgan College, a mixed technical college located in the castle grounds. The Convent of Mercy school is situated within the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Mercy\"&gt;Sisters of Mercy&lt;/a&gt;'s complex attached to St. Colman's Church, and also includes a convent, primary school, graveyard and grotto. Col\u00e1iste De La Salle was opened in 1933 and originally located in the town hall, until a permanent building was completed three years later. By the late 1970s the school was experiencing severe capacity issues and a re-structure and extension of the school was undertaken in 1982. Since its opening the ratio of pupils has remained relatively stable with 40% coming from the town and the rest from surrounding parishes. A new building was built in 2008 for St Colman's Boys National School after years of planning applications and appeals."
