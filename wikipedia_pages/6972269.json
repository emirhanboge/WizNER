    "text": "Group 10 is a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Central West area of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;. It had been under the control of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Country%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Country Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; but that changed after the NSWRL agreed to a new constitution and the CRL voted to wind up its affairs immediately. The decisions was made on 19 October 2019 and the merger means that the aim of a unified administration of the sport in NSW was achieved over a year ahead of time.\nGames in the competition are usually played on Sundays with some Saturday night matches. There are currently eight clubs based in the competition playing across the four senior grades, including women's league tag and a total of 15 clubs fielding sides in several junior grades.\nOrigin and formation.\nAt the end of the 1946 representative campaign, it was Bathurst that was crowned Western Challenge Cup premiers after finishing ahead of Lithgow, Orange and Oberon in the four-team group. The team's 7\u20130 win against Oberon in the final match of the round-robin competition in August at the Bathurst Sportsground saw the team finish the campaign undefeated.\nGroup 10 would meet two months later but Group 10 secretary Harley Brazil put forward a radical proposal, which alter the future of rugby league in the Central West region. Brazil put forward a \"scheme\" for an inter-town competition, with a goal to kick off in 1947. Brazil's idea was to see the leading eight teams in the Group (Bathurst Railway, Bathurst Waratahs, Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Lithgow Western Suburbs, &lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt;, Orange Our Boys, Orange Waratahs and Portland) participate in the competition.\nWhen the districts met in February, not everyone accepted Brazil's proposal, which become referred to as the 'Brazil plan' by the local press. Representatives from &lt;a href=\"Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithgow%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Lithgow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mudgee%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Mudgee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oberon%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blayney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Blayney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; would debate over three proposals for several hours. The three proposals mentioned in the \"&lt;a href=\"Lithgow%20Mercury\"&gt;Lithgow Mercury&lt;/a&gt;\" on 26 February 1947 included:\nUltimately, it was the 'Brazil plan' that was adopted by 10 votes to eight but it was quickly followed by opposition from Orange and Bathurst.\nIssues continued and by Group 10's annual general meeting on 16 March, tensions reached boiling point between Orange and Bathurst and the other leagues. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Lithgow%20Mercury\"&gt;Lithgow Mercury&lt;/a&gt;\", Bathurst and Orange were granted permission to conduct their own competitions, independent of the new inter-town club tournament.\nBrazil's plan for a new inter-town club competition was thrown into turmoil, with only four teams nominating, well below the secretary's eight-team dream. At the Group's meeting on 7 April, only Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Lithgow Western Suburbs, &lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon Tigers&lt;/a&gt; and Portland Colts had put their hands up for the new competition.\nThe first ever games in Group 10 had been locked in for Sunday, 13 April. Wests would play Oberon in Lithgow, while Portland would host Factory. Both games would kick-off at 3.15pm, with curtain-raisers the local Lithgow first grade competition games. Match reports in the \"&lt;a href=\"Lithgow%20Mercury\"&gt;Lithgow Mercury&lt;/a&gt;\" indicate Wests overcame the Tigers 17\u20133. C. Hallam scored the first try for Wests, which may have been the first ever try scored in the competition. In the other match, Portland downed Factory 14\u20137. Factory won the inaugural premiership by defeating Portland 17\u20137 in the grand final.\nOverview.\nAs of the 2020 season, Group 10 consists of eight teams from six towns across the &lt;a href=\"Central%20West%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Central West&lt;/a&gt;. There are four grades: Premier League, First Division, Under 18s and Women's League Tag. Nine teams had previously competed in the Premier League competition from 2013 to 2019, however, &lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon Tigers&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from the competition ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Group%2010%20Rugby%20League%20season\"&gt;2020 season&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the total clubs down to eight. Games are usually held on Sundays, however, there are occasional Saturday games and Friday night games.\nThe current season format consists of fourteen rounds, with each team playing each other twice. The top five teams then play-off to the &lt;a href=\"McIntyre%20%26quot%3BFinal%20Five%26quot%3B%20system\"&gt;McIntyre final five system&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the grand final which is held at the home ground of the major semi-final winner.\nFormer &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; players to play in Group 10 in recent times include &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Branighan\"&gt;Luke Branighan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bathurst%20St%20Patrick%27s\"&gt;Bathurst St Patrick's&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Starling\"&gt;Josh Starling&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bathurst%20Panthers\"&gt;Bathurst Panthers&lt;/a&gt;), with the latter signing on for the Panthers ahead of the 2020 season.
