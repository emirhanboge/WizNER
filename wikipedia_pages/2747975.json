    "text": "Gus Triandos (July 30, 1930 \u2013 March 28, 2013) was a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20American\"&gt;Greek American&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;. He played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; (AL) and the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; (NL). A four-time &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt;, he batted and threw right-handed. In 1981, he was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;, Triandos attended &lt;a href=\"Mission%20High%20School%20%28San%20Francisco%29\"&gt;Mission High School&lt;/a&gt; and was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1948%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the Yankees' major league roster briefly as a 22-year-old in &lt;a href=\"1953%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;, but was sent back to the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1954%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;. Triandos was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in &lt;a href=\"1954%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt; where he played mostly as a first baseman for his first two years with the team, before becoming the Orioles' regular catcher in &lt;a href=\"1957%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Orioles' catcher, he used an outsized &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20glove%23Varieties\"&gt;catcher's mitt&lt;/a&gt; designed by manager &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Richards%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Paul Richards&lt;/a&gt; to handle the unpredictable &lt;a href=\"knuckleball\"&gt;knuckleball&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hoyt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Hoyt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Triandos was behind the plate when Wilhelm threw a &lt;a href=\"no%20hitter\"&gt;no hitter&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"1958%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; on September 20, &lt;a href=\"1958%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt;, the first no-hitter in Baltimore Orioles history, and also scored the only run of the game when he hit a home run in the eighth &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough perhaps the slowest runner in the league, Triandos once hit an inside-the-park home run. As of 2021, he also holds the record for the most consecutive games without being caught stealing, 1,206. That accounts for his entire career, in which he had exactly one stolen base. That stolen base came on September 28, 1958, in the 9th &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; of the last game of the season, at &lt;a href=\"Yankee%20Stadium\"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, off rookie pitcher &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Monroe\"&gt;Zach Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and catcher &lt;a href=\"Darrell%20Johnson\"&gt;Darrell Johnson&lt;/a&gt; \nTriandos had his best year in 1958, when he hit 16 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s by mid-season to earn the starting catcher's role for the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1958%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1958 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, breaking &lt;a href=\"Yogi%20Berra\"&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt;'s eight-year stranglehold on the position. He ended the season leading all American League catchers in &lt;a href=\"putout\"&gt;putout&lt;/a&gt;s with 698, and tied Berra's American League record of 30 home runs by a catcher. In &lt;a href=\"1959%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;, he hit 20 home runs by mid-season and was again selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20%28first%20game%29\"&gt;1959 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, However, a hand injury meant that he only had 25 home runs for the entire season.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1962%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, he hit .169 in 63 games and was traded to the Detroit Tigers at the end of the year. With the Tigers in &lt;a href=\"1963%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;, he shared catching duties with &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Freehan\"&gt;Bill Freehan&lt;/a&gt; and led American League catchers with a .996 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. The following winter, he was traded along with &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bunning\"&gt;Jim Bunning&lt;/a&gt; to the Philadelphia Phillies, where he again shared catching duties, this time with &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Dalrymple\"&gt;Clay Dalrymple&lt;/a&gt;. As the Phillies' catcher, Triandos caught &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bunning%27s%20perfect%20game\"&gt;Bunning's perfect game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; on June 21, &lt;a href=\"1964%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;, thus becoming the first catcher in Major League history to catch no hitters in both the American and National Leagues. His contract was purchased by the Houston Astros from the Philadelphia Phillies on June 14, &lt;a href=\"1965%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;. He played in his final major league game at the age of 34 before being released by the Astros on August 20, 1965.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a 13-year major league career, Triandos played in 1,206 &lt;a href=\"Games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, accumulating 954 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in 3,907 &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt; for a .244 career &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; along with 167 home runs, 608 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; and a .322 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt;. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage in 992 games as a catcher and, a .988 fielding percentage in 168 games as a first baseman. Triandos led American League catchers twice in &lt;a href=\"Assist%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;assists&lt;/a&gt; and in baserunners &lt;a href=\"caught%20stealing\"&gt;caught stealing&lt;/a&gt;. In 1957, he threw out 66.7% of the base runners trying to steal a base, the third highest single-season ratio in Major League history. Over his career, Triandos threw out 46.62% of the &lt;a href=\"Baserunning\"&gt;base runners&lt;/a&gt; who tried to &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20base\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; a base on him, ranking him 6th on the all-time list.\nTriandos was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;American League All-Star team&lt;/a&gt; for three consecutive years, in &lt;a href=\"1957%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1958%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1959%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20%28first%20game%29\"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;. His 142 home runs hit as an Oriole player ranks him 13th highest in the team's history. In 1961, the reigning American League stolen base champion, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Aparicio\"&gt;Luis Aparicio&lt;/a&gt;, rated Triandos just below &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Battey\"&gt;Earl Battey&lt;/a&gt; as the toughest catcher on which to attempt a stolen base.\nPersonal life.\nTriandos's family origins are from &lt;a href=\"Koroni\"&gt;Koroni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Messenia\"&gt;Messenia&lt;/a&gt;, Greece. He was one of four children of Peter Triandos and Helen Mourgos, Greek immigrants to the U.S. He and wife Evelyn had three children, son Gary Triandos and daughters Lori Luna and Tracey Hook.\nTriandos served as a scout for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; from 1973 to 1975. In later years, he lived in San Jose, California. Triandos Drive in &lt;a href=\"Timonium%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Timonium, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; is named in honor of the popular catcher.\nIn popular culture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"All%20Due%20Respect%20%28The%20Wire%29\"&gt;the second episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Wire%20%28season%203%29\"&gt;the third season&lt;/a&gt; of Baltimore-based &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; show &lt;a href=\"The%20Wire\"&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;, Triandos is referenced and discussed about by the character &lt;a href=\"Herc\"&gt;Herc&lt;/a&gt;, who talks about how Triandos was tasked with the tough job of catching for &lt;a href=\"knuckleball\"&gt;knuckleball&lt;/a&gt; pitcher &lt;a href=\"Hoyt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Hoyt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; for five years and how Triandos remarked that catching for Wilhelm \"nearly ruined me.\" The reference to Triandos arose when Herc told Carver that if he had to engage in sexual intercourse with any man it would have to be Triandos."
