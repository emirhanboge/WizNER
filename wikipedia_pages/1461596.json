In 1998, Doseone released his first solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Hemispheres%20%28Doseone%20album%29\"&gt;Hemispheres&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2000, he released \"&lt;a href=\"Circle%20%28Boom%20Bip%20and%20Doseone%20album%29\"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt;\", a collaborative album with producer &lt;a href=\"Boom%20Bip\"&gt;Boom Bip&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, he released the solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"G%20Is%20for%20Deep\"&gt;G Is for Deep&lt;/a&gt;\", on &lt;a href=\"Anticon\"&gt;Anticon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoseone is also a visual artist. He has worked on the cover art for many of the albums he has performed on. He has contributed the artwork on Jel's album \"&lt;a href=\"Soft%20Money%20%28album%29\"&gt;Soft Money&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2006. He has also done work in animation. He worked on an online animated cartoon \"NOTGarfield\". The series consists of characters from \"&lt;a href=\"Garfield\"&gt;Garfield&lt;/a&gt;\" involved in surreal &lt;a href=\"dada\"&gt;dada&lt;/a&gt; situations.\nIn January 2012 it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Adult%20Swim\"&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt; has ordered a pilot of an animated series called \"Mars Safari\" that will feature a soundtrack by Doseone and Jel. Doseone will star alongside &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Little%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Steve Little&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Weathers\"&gt;Carl Weathers&lt;/a&gt; to voice the character Emilio.\nDoseone has also participated in creating music for indie games, including Sludge Life, &lt;a href=\"Samurai%20Gunn\"&gt;Samurai Gunn&lt;/a&gt;, Catacomb Kids, &lt;a href=\"Enter%20the%20Gungeon\"&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vlambeer\"&gt;Vlambeer&lt;/a&gt;'s games Gun Godz and &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20Throne\"&gt;Nuclear Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Messhof\"&gt;Messhof&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Nidhogg%202\"&gt;Nidhogg 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disc%20Room\"&gt;Disc Room&lt;/a&gt; and many other independent games currently in development.\nStyle.\nDoseone is known for his nasal and high pitched voice, fast &lt;a href=\"polyrhythm\"&gt;polyrhythm&lt;/a&gt;ic rapping style, and extremely dense and abstract lyrics. His words tend to express upon topics of &lt;a href=\"childhood\"&gt;childhood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, and American life. While rapping/singing onstage, he often also simultaneously performs on the &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29\"&gt;sampler&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nA recurring character in much of Doseone's work is a man named Hour Hero Yes. He is mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"13%20%26amp%3B%20God\"&gt;13 &amp; God&lt;/a&gt; song \"Ghostwork\" as well as throughout albums of his band &lt;a href=\"Subtle%20%28band%29\"&gt;Subtle&lt;/a&gt;. Album and video artwork, as well as art on Subtle's official website, suggest Hour Hero Yes to be a bald man with a black and white striped face; an image which is embodied by a bust that serves as a &lt;a href=\"centerpiece\"&gt;centerpiece&lt;/a&gt; prop during live Subtle shows. On the cover of \"\", he appears in old military garb with fire for hair.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nLive albums\nEPs\nSingles\nAudio books"
