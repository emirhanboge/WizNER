    "text": "White is the &lt;a href=\"lightness\"&gt;lightest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"color\"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt; and is achromatic (having no &lt;a href=\"hue\"&gt;hue&lt;/a&gt;). It is the color of snow, &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;, and milk, and is the opposite of &lt;a href=\"black\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;. White objects fully &lt;a href=\"diffuse%20reflection\"&gt;reflect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scattering\"&gt;scatter&lt;/a&gt; all the &lt;a href=\"visible%20spectrum\"&gt;visible wavelengths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;. White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. The color white can be given with white pigments, especially &lt;a href=\"titanium%20dioxide\"&gt;titanium dioxide&lt;/a&gt;.\nSymbolic meaning.\nIn ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; (1917\u20131922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century &lt;a href=\"modern%20architecture\"&gt;modern architecture&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.\nAccording to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The &lt;a href=\"pope\"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western culture&lt;/a&gt; has long followed the tradition of wearing white on one's wedding day. It continues to be prevalent amongst contemporary brides and as &lt;a href=\"XO%20Group\"&gt;Wedding Wire&lt;/a&gt;, a wedding company reports, about 85 percent of brides still choose to wear a white wedding dress because in its typical fashion, it has remained steady through the years. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for &lt;a href=\"wedding%20dresses\"&gt;wedding dresses&lt;/a&gt;, symbolizing purity and virginity. In 2018, about 83% of brides in the United States wore white dresses on the day of their wedding, according to a survey by &lt;a href=\"Brides%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Brides Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt; religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Awhite\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;\" continues &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; ', ultimately from a &lt;a href=\"Common%20Germanic\"&gt;Common Germanic&lt;/a&gt; ' also reflected in &lt;a href=\"Old%20High%20German\"&gt;OHG&lt;/a&gt; ', &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;ON&lt;/a&gt; ', &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20language\"&gt;Goth.&lt;/a&gt; '. The root is ultimately from &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-European%20language\"&gt;Proto-Indo-European language&lt;/a&gt; ', surviving also in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; ' \"to be white or bright\" and Slavonic ' \"light\". The &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20language\"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt; word for white, ', is directly derived from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; form of the word '. Common Germanic also had the word *\"blankaz\" (\"white, bright, blinding\"), borrowed into &lt;a href=\"Late%20Latin\"&gt;Late Latin&lt;/a&gt; as *\"blancus\", which provided the source for &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt; words for \"white\" (Catalan, Occitan and French \"blanc\", Spanish \"blanco\", Italian \"bianco\", Galician-Portuguese \"branco\", etc.). The antonym of white is black.\nSome non-European languages have a wide variety of terms for white. The &lt;a href=\"Inuit\"&gt;Inuit&lt;/a&gt; language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white. &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; has specific words for bright white, the white of teeth, the white of &lt;a href=\"sandalwood\"&gt;sandalwood&lt;/a&gt;, the white of the autumn moon, the white of silver, the white of cow's milk, the white of pearls, the white of a ray of sunlight, and the white of stars. Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.\nHistory and art.\nPrehistoric and ancient history.\nWhite was one of the first colors used in art. The &lt;a href=\"Lascaux%20Cave\"&gt;Lascaux Cave&lt;/a&gt; in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by &lt;a href=\"paleolithic\"&gt;paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; artists used &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes as a background, sometimes as a highlight, along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings.\nIn &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, white was connected with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Isis\"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt;. The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen, and it was used to wrap &lt;a href=\"mummies\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Greece and other ancient civilizations, white was often associated with mother's milk. In &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, the chief god &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea. In the &lt;a href=\"Talmud\"&gt;Talmud&lt;/a&gt;, milk was one of four sacred substances, along with wine, honey, and the rose.\nThe ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light, so white was a fundamental color. According to &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Natural History\", &lt;a href=\"Apelles\"&gt;Apelles&lt;/a&gt; (4th century BC) and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings; white, red, yellow and black; For painting, the Greeks used the highly toxic pigment &lt;a href=\"lead%20white\"&gt;lead white&lt;/a&gt;, made by a long and laborious process.\nA plain white &lt;a href=\"toga\"&gt;toga&lt;/a&gt;, known as a \"toga virilis\", was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of 14\u201318. Magistrates and certain priests wore a \"toga praetexta\", with a broad purple stripe.\nIn the time of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;, no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga.\nThe ancient Romans had two words for white; \"albus\", a plain white, (the source of the word \"albino\"); and \"candidus,\" a brighter white. A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk, called a \"toga candida\", the origin of the word \"candidate\". The Latin word \"candere\" meant to shine, to be bright. It was the origin of the words \"candle\" and \"candid\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, the priestesses of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Vesta%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Vesta&lt;/a&gt; dressed in white linen robes, a white &lt;a href=\"palla%20%28garment%29\"&gt;palla&lt;/a&gt; or shawl, and a white veil. They protected the sacred fire and the &lt;a href=\"penates\"&gt;penates&lt;/a&gt; of Rome. White symbolized their purity, loyalty, and chastity.\nPostclassical history.\nThe early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity, sacrifice and virtue. It became the color worn by priests during Mass, the color worn by monks of the &lt;a href=\"Cistercian%20Order\"&gt;Cistercian Order&lt;/a&gt;, and, under &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20V\"&gt;Pope Pius V&lt;/a&gt;, a former monk of the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican Order&lt;/a&gt;, it became the official color worn by the pope himself. Monks of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict\"&gt;Order of Saint Benedict&lt;/a&gt; dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool, but later changed to black, the color of humility and penitence.\nPostclassical history art, the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind. John the Baptist described &lt;a href=\"Christ\"&gt;Christ&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"lamb%20of%20God\"&gt;lamb of God&lt;/a&gt;, who took the sins of the world upon himself. The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period, the \"&lt;a href=\"Ghent%20Altarpiece\"&gt;Ghent Altarpiece&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Jan%20van%20Eyck\"&gt;Jan van Eyck&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite was also the symbolic color of the &lt;a href=\"Transfiguration%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;transfiguration&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Saint%20Mark\"&gt;Gospel of Saint Mark&lt;/a&gt; describes Jesus' clothing in this event as \"shining, exceeding white as snow.\" Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments. In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light &lt;a href=\"gold%20ground\"&gt;gold background&lt;/a&gt;, placed in an almond-shaped halo.\nThe white &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts, paintings and tapestries. It was a symbol of purity, chastity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary.\nDuring the Postclassical history, painters rarely ever mixed colors; but in the Renaissance, the influential humanist and scholar &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Battista%20Alberti\"&gt;Leon Battista Alberti&lt;/a&gt; encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter, brighter, and to add \"hilaritas\", or gaiety. Many painters followed his advice, and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter.\nModern history.\nUntil the 16th century, white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning. The widows of the kings of France wore white until &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Anne of Brittany&lt;/a&gt; in the 16th century. A white tunic was also worn by many knights, along with a red cloak, which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nWhite was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; period and especially the &lt;a href=\"Rococo\"&gt;Rococo&lt;/a&gt; style that followed it in the 18th century. Church interiors were designed to show the power, glory and wealth of the church. They seemed to be alive, filled with curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary and reliefs, unified by white.\nWhite was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century. Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white &lt;a href=\"stockings\"&gt;stockings&lt;/a&gt;, and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, a more austere white (\"blanc cass\u00e9\") became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome. Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses, the ladies wearing them were called \"les merveilleuses\" (the marvellous) by French men of that era. The &lt;a href=\"Empire%20style\"&gt;Empire style&lt;/a&gt; under Emperor Napol\u00e9on I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome. The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France; in 1814 the former wife of Napoleon, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais\"&gt;Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais&lt;/a&gt;, caught &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander I of Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color. The reason was simple; the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade. When linen was worn out, it was collected and turned into high-quality paper.\nThe 19th-century American painter &lt;a href=\"James%20McNeill%20Whistler\"&gt;James McNeill Whistler&lt;/a&gt; (1834\u20131903), working at the same time as the French impressionists, created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods, the way composers used music. His painting \"Symphony in White No. 1 \u2013 The White Girl\", which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model, used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility, and a moment of uncertainty.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White%20movement\"&gt;White movement&lt;/a&gt; was the opposition that formed against the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, which followed the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921\u201322, and many of its members emigrated to Europe.\nAt the end of the 19th century, lead white was still the most popular pigment; but between 1916 and 1918, chemical companies in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the United States began to produce &lt;a href=\"titanium%20white\"&gt;titanium white&lt;/a&gt;, made from &lt;a href=\"titanium%20oxide\"&gt;titanium oxide&lt;/a&gt;. It had first been identified in the 18th century by the German chemist &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Klaproth\"&gt;Martin Klaproth&lt;/a&gt;, who also discovered &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;. It had twice the covering power of lead white, and was the brightest white pigment known. By 1945, 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white.\nThe absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters. It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter &lt;a href=\"Kazimir%20Malevich\"&gt;Kazimir Malevich&lt;/a&gt; in his 1917 painting 'the white square,' the companion to his earlier 'black square.' It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter &lt;a href=\"Piet%20Mondrian\"&gt;Piet Mondrian&lt;/a&gt;. His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors.\nBlack and white also appealed to modernist architects, such as &lt;a href=\"Le%20Corbusier\"&gt;Le Corbusier&lt;/a&gt; (1887\u20131965). He said a house was \"a machine for living in\" and called for a \"calm and powerful architecture\" built of reinforced concrete and steel, without any ornament or frills. Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Meier\"&gt;Richard Meier&lt;/a&gt;, such as his museum in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; to house the ancient Roman &lt;a href=\"Ara%20Pacis\"&gt;Ara Pacis&lt;/a&gt;, or Altar of Peace, are stark white, in the tradition of Le Corbusier.\nScientific understanding (Color science).\nLight is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive &lt;a href=\"cone%20cell\"&gt;cone cell&lt;/a&gt;s in the eye in roughly equal amounts. Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a &lt;a href=\"Diffuse%20reflection\"&gt;diffuse way&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite light.\nIn 1666, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that &lt;a href=\"Electromagnetic%20spectrum%23Visible%20radiation%20%28light%29\"&gt;white light&lt;/a&gt; was composed of multiple colors by passing it through a &lt;a href=\"prism\"&gt;prism&lt;/a&gt; to break it up into components then using a second prism to reassemble them. Before Newton, most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite light can be generated by the sun, by stars, or by earthbound sources such as &lt;a href=\"Fluorescent%20lamp\"&gt;fluorescent&lt;/a&gt; lamps, &lt;a href=\"Light-emitting%20diode%23White%20light\"&gt;white LEDs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Incandescent%20lamps\"&gt;incandescent bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. On the screen of a color television or computer, white is produced by mixing the &lt;a href=\"primary%20color\"&gt;primary color&lt;/a&gt;s of light: red, green and blue (&lt;a href=\"RGB\"&gt;RGB&lt;/a&gt;) at full intensity, a process called &lt;a href=\"additive%20mixing\"&gt;additive mixing&lt;/a&gt; (see image below). White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths, for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers. This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted.\nThe fact that light sources with vastly different &lt;a href=\"spectral%20power%20distribution\"&gt;spectral power distribution&lt;/a&gt;s can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a &lt;a href=\"metamerism%20%28color%29\"&gt;metamerism&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light, incandescent lamps of various &lt;a href=\"Color%20temperature\"&gt;Color temperature&lt;/a&gt;s). This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of \"all colors\" or \"all visible wavelengths\". This widespread idea is a misconception, and might originally stem from the fact that &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton%23Optics\"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt; discovered that \"sunlight\" is composed of light with wavelengths across the visible spectrum. Concluding that \"since \"all colors\" produce white light then white must be made up of \"all colors\"\" is a common logical error called &lt;a href=\"affirming%20the%20consequent\"&gt;affirming the consequent&lt;/a&gt;, which might be the cause of the misunderstanding.\nA range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white\u2014there is no single, unique specification of \"white light\". For example, when buying a \"white\" light bulb, one might buy one labeled 2700K, 6000K, etc., which produce light having very different spectral distributions, and yet this will not prevent the user from identifying the color of objects that those light bulbs illuminate.\nWhite objects.\nColor vision allows us to distinguish different &lt;a href=\"Color%23Color%20of%20objects\"&gt;\"objects\" by their color&lt;/a&gt;. In order to do so, &lt;a href=\"color%20constancy\"&gt;color constancy&lt;/a&gt; can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad (whitish) spectral distributions of light.\nThe same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of &lt;a href=\"white%20point\"&gt;white point&lt;/a&gt; determines a transformation of all other color stimuli. Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as &lt;a href=\"The%20dress%20%28viral%20phenomenon%29\"&gt;The dress&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile there is no single, unique specification of \"white light\", there is indeed a unique specification of \"white object\", or, more specifically, \"white surface\".\nA perfectly white surface &lt;a href=\"diffuse%20reflection\"&gt;diffusely reflects&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"light%20scattering\"&gt;scatters&lt;/a&gt;) all visible light that strikes it, without &lt;a href=\"light%20absorption\"&gt;absorbing&lt;/a&gt; any, irrespective of the light's wavelength or spectral distribution.\nSince it does not absorb any of the incident light, white is the lightest possible color.\nIf the reflection is not diffuse but rather &lt;a href=\"specular%20reflection\"&gt;specular&lt;/a&gt;, this describes a mirror rather than a white surface.\nReflection of 100% of incident light at all wavelengths is a form of uniform reflectance, so white is an achromatic color, meaning a color without &lt;a href=\"hue\"&gt;hue&lt;/a&gt;. The color stimulus produced by the perfect diffuser is usually considered to be an achromatic stimulus for all illuminants, except for those whose light sources appear to be highly chromatic.\nColor constancy is achieved by &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20adaptation\"&gt;chromatic adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Commission%20on%20Illumination\"&gt;International Commission on Illumination&lt;/a&gt; defines \"white (adapted)\" as \"a color stimulus that an observer who is [chromatically] adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity. The color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene.\nWhite features in nature.\nBeaches with &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; containing high amounts of &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt; or eroded &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; also appear white, since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight, rather than absorbing it. Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white &lt;a href=\"calcium%20carbonate\"&gt;calcium carbonate&lt;/a&gt; from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White%20Cliffs%20of%20Dover\"&gt;White Cliffs of Dover&lt;/a&gt; take their white color from the large amount of &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;, made of &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, which they contain, which reflects the sunlight.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt; is a mixture of air and tiny &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; crystals. When white &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; enters snow, very little of the spectrum is absorbed; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules, so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight, white. Sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered, making the snow seem to sparkle.\nIn the case of &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s, the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air. As sunlight enters the ice, more light of the red spectrum is absorbed, so the light scattered will be bluish.\n&lt;a href=\"Cloud\"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt;s are white for the same reason as ice. They are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air, very little light that strikes them is absorbed, and most of the light is scattered, appearing to the eye as white. Shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray, and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud.\nMany mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly: &lt;a href=\"Mauna%20Kea\"&gt;Mauna Kea&lt;/a&gt; means \"white mountain\" in &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20language\"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mont%20Blanc\"&gt;Mont Blanc&lt;/a&gt; means \"white mountain\" in French. &lt;a href=\"Changbai%20Mountains\"&gt;Changbai Mountains&lt;/a&gt; literally meaning \"perpetually white mountains\", marks the border between China and Korea.\nWhite materials.\n&lt;a href=\"Chalk\"&gt;Chalk&lt;/a&gt; is a type of &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, made of the mineral &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"calcium%20carbonate\"&gt;calcium carbonate&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro-organisms called &lt;a href=\"Coccolithophore\"&gt;Coccolithophore&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings. The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of &lt;a href=\"gypsum\"&gt;gypsum&lt;/a&gt; or calcium sulphate, a powder pressed into sticks.\n\"Bianco di San Giovanni\" is a pigment used in the Renaissance, which was described by the painter &lt;a href=\"Cennino%20Cennini\"&gt;Cennino Cennini&lt;/a&gt; in the 15th century. It is similar to chalk, made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. It was made of dried lime which was made into a powder, then soaked in water for eight days, with the water changed each day. It was then made into cakes and dried in the sun.\n&lt;a href=\"Lead%20white\"&gt;Lead white&lt;/a&gt; was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described is &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitruvius\"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt; and the ancient Greek author &lt;a href=\"Theophrastus\"&gt;Theophrastus&lt;/a&gt;. Pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt;. The pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung. The combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into &lt;a href=\"lead%20carbonate\"&gt;lead carbonate&lt;/a&gt;. It was a slow process which could take a month or more. It made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries, but it was also toxic. It was replaced in the 19th century by &lt;a href=\"zinc%20white\"&gt;zinc white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"titanium%20white\"&gt;titanium white&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Titanium%20white\"&gt;Titanium white&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular white for artists today; it is the brightest available white pigment, and has twice the coverage of lead white. It first became commercially available in 1921. It is made out of &lt;a href=\"titanium%20dioxide\"&gt;titanium dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, from the minerals &lt;a href=\"brookite\"&gt;brookite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anatase\"&gt;anatase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rutile\"&gt;rutile&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"ilmenite\"&gt;ilmenite&lt;/a&gt;, currently the major source. Because of its brilliant whiteness, it is used as a colorant for most &lt;a href=\"toothpaste\"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sunscreen\"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zinc%20white\"&gt;Zinc white&lt;/a&gt; is made from &lt;a href=\"zinc%20oxide\"&gt;zinc oxide&lt;/a&gt;. It is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white. It is added to some foods to &lt;a href=\"Food%20fortification\"&gt;enrich&lt;/a&gt; them with zinc, an important &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20white\"&gt;Chinese white&lt;/a&gt; is a variety of zinc white made for artists.\nSome materials can be made to look \"whiter than white\", this is achieved using &lt;a href=\"optical%20brightener\"&gt;optical brightener&lt;/a&gt; agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet\"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt; and violet region (usually 340\u2013370\u00a0nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420\u2013470\u00a0nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.\nBleach and bleaching.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleaching\"&gt;Bleaching&lt;/a&gt; is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of &lt;a href=\"chlorine%20bleach\"&gt;chlorine bleach&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"sodium%20hypochlorite\"&gt;sodium hypochlorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"calcium%20hypochlorite\"&gt;calcium hypochlorite&lt;/a&gt; (bleaching powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on &lt;a href=\"peroxide\"&gt;peroxide&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20peroxide\"&gt;hydrogen peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sodium%20percarbonate\"&gt;sodium percarbonate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sodium%20perborate\"&gt;sodium perborate&lt;/a&gt;. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are &lt;a href=\"reducing%20agents\"&gt;reducing agents&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"sodium%20dithionite\"&gt;sodium dithionite&lt;/a&gt;.\nBleaches attack the &lt;a href=\"chromophore\"&gt;chromophore&lt;/a&gt;s, the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors. An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20bond\"&gt;chemical bond&lt;/a&gt;s that make up the chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb &lt;a href=\"visible%20light\"&gt;visible light&lt;/a&gt;. A reducing bleach works by converting &lt;a href=\"double%20bond\"&gt;double bond&lt;/a&gt;s in the chromophore into &lt;a href=\"single%20bond\"&gt;single bond&lt;/a&gt;s. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light.\nSunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process. High energy &lt;a href=\"photon\"&gt;photon&lt;/a&gt;s of light, often in the &lt;a href=\"violet%20%28color%29\"&gt;violet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet\"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt; range, can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore, rendering the resulting substance colorless.\nSome detergents go one step further; they contain &lt;a href=\"fluorescent\"&gt;fluorescent&lt;/a&gt; chemicals which glow, making the fabric look literally whiter than white.\nIn the natural world.\nAstronomy.\nA &lt;a href=\"white%20dwarf\"&gt;white dwarf&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Compact%20star\"&gt;stellar remnant&lt;/a&gt; composed mostly of &lt;a href=\"electron-degenerate%20matter\"&gt;electron-degenerate matter&lt;/a&gt;. They are very &lt;a href=\"density\"&gt;dense&lt;/a&gt;; a white dwarf's mass is comparable to that of the Sun and its volume is comparable to that of the Earth. Its faint &lt;a href=\"luminosity\"&gt;luminosity&lt;/a&gt; comes from the &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20radiation\"&gt;emission&lt;/a&gt; of stored &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;thermal energy&lt;/a&gt;. A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high &lt;a href=\"color%20temperature\"&gt;color temperature&lt;/a&gt;, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will become a cold &lt;a href=\"black%20dwarf\"&gt;black dwarf&lt;/a&gt;. However, since no white dwarf can be older than the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20universe\"&gt;Age of the universe&lt;/a&gt; (approximately 13.8\u00a0billion years), even the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand &lt;a href=\"kelvin\"&gt;kelvin&lt;/a&gt;s, and no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.\nAn &lt;a href=\"A-type%20main-sequence%20star\"&gt;A-type main-sequence star&lt;/a&gt; (A V) or A dwarf star is a &lt;a href=\"main%20sequence\"&gt;main-sequence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;-burning) &lt;a href=\"star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"spectral%20classification\"&gt;spectral type&lt;/a&gt; A and &lt;a href=\"luminosity%20class\"&gt;luminosity class&lt;/a&gt; V. These stars have &lt;a href=\"electromagnetic%20spectrum\"&gt;spectra&lt;/a&gt; which are defined by strong &lt;a href=\"Balmer%20series\"&gt;hydrogen Balmer absorption lines&lt;/a&gt;. They have &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es from 1.4 to 2.1 times the &lt;a href=\"solar%20mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"effective%20temperature\"&gt;surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt; between 7600 and 11 500 \u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kelvin\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nWhite animals use their color as a form of camouflage in winter.\nReligion and culture.\nWhite is an important symbolic color in most religions and cultures, usually because of its association with purity. For example, white wedding gowns are primarily preferred by Western &lt;a href=\"Christian\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; families and are worn by the bride as a symbol of purity, innocence, and goodness.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, white is associated with &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, innocence and sacrifice. Since the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, priests wear a white &lt;a href=\"cassock\"&gt;cassock&lt;/a&gt; in many of the most important ceremonies and religious services connected with events in the life of Christ. White is worn by priests at &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Easter\"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;, and during celebrations connected with the other events of the life of Christ, such as Corpus Christi Sunday, and &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Sunday\"&gt;Trinity Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. It is also worn at the services dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, and to those Saints who were not martyred, as well as other special occasions, such as the ordination of priests and the installation of new bishops. Within the hierarchy of the church, the lighter the color, the higher the rank. Ordinary priests wear black; bishops wear violet, cardinals wear red, and outside a church, only the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; will wear white. Popes occasionally wore white in the Middle Ages, but usually wore red. Popes have worn white regularly since 1566, when &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20V\"&gt;Pope Pius V&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican Order&lt;/a&gt;, began the practice. White is the color of the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Revelation 19:7-8, John the Apostle writes about the bride (i.e., the Christian Church) being presented to Jesus. He describes her as wearing \"fine linen, bright and clean,\" which many have interpreted to mean wearing the color white. Similarly, the bridal veil has long been considered a reference to the Temple veil\u2014a cloth that, in Biblical times, kept the Ark of the Covenant hidden from view. When Christ died, the veil was torn, signifying the forgiveness of sin and the people's reconnection with God. Similarly, the bridal veil is lifted during the wedding, signifying the couple's connection to one another.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; the color white is used as a symbol of purity, innocence, and cleanliness, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Ordinance%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29\"&gt;religious ceremonies&lt;/a&gt; such as baptism and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20%28LDS%20Church%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies. In temple ceremonies, white clothing is also worn by all participants, both men and women, to also symbolize unity and equality before God.\nIn Islam, white clothing is worn during required pilgrimage to Mecca, or \"&lt;a href=\"Ihram\"&gt;Ihram&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"pilgrimage\"&gt;pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Hajj\"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt;\").&lt;a href=\"Hajj\"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt;. Called &lt;a href=\"Ihram%20clothing\"&gt;Ihram clothing&lt;/a&gt;, men's garments often consist of two white un-hemmed sheets (usually towelling material). The top (the \"ri\u1e0d\u0101\") is draped over the torso and the bottom (the \"iz\u0101r\") is secured by a belt; plus a pair of sandals. Women's clothing varies considerably and reflects regional as well as religious influences. Ihram is typically worn during &lt;a href=\"Dhu%20al-Hijjah\"&gt;Dhu al-Hijjah&lt;/a&gt;, the last month in the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20calendar\"&gt;Islamic calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite also has a long history of use as a religious and political symbol in Islam, beginning with the white banner that tradition ascribes to the &lt;a href=\"Quraysh\"&gt;Quraysh&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe to which &lt;a href=\"Muhammad\"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; belonged. The &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad dynasty&lt;/a&gt; also used white as its dynastic color, following the personal banner of its founder, &lt;a href=\"Mu%27awiya%20I\"&gt;Mu'awiya I&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Shi%27ite\"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fatimid%20Caliphate\"&gt;Fatimids&lt;/a&gt; also chose white to highlight their opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abbasid%20Caliphate\"&gt;Abbasid Caliphate&lt;/a&gt;, whose color was black.\nIn Judaism, during the rituals of &lt;a href=\"Yom%20Kippur\"&gt;Yom Kippur&lt;/a&gt;, the ceremony of &lt;a href=\"Atonement%20in%20Judaism\"&gt;atonement&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt; dresses in white, as do the members of the congregation, to restore the bonds between God and his followers.\nMany religions symbolize heaven by using a sky with white clouds. This phenomenon is not limited to western culture; in &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20religion\"&gt;Yoruba religion&lt;/a&gt;, the orisha &lt;a href=\"Obatala\"&gt;Obatala&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"If%C3%A1\"&gt;If\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; tradition is represented by white. Obatala is associated with calmness, morality, old age, and purity.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29\"&gt;Theosophy&lt;/a&gt; and similar religions, the &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20White%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Great White Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; are said to have white &lt;a href=\"aura%20%28paranormal%29\"&gt;auras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn some Asian and Slavic cultures, white is considered to be a color that represents death. White also represented death in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, representing the lifeless desert that covered much of the country; black was held to be the color of life, representing the mud-covered fertile lands created by the flooding of the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt; and giving the country its name (\"Kemet\", or \"black land\").\nIn China, Korea, and some other Asian countries, white, or more precisely, the whitish color of undyed linen, is the color of mourning and funerals.\nIn traditional China, undyed linen clothing is worn at funerals. As time passes, the bereaved can gradually wear clothing dyed with colors, then with darker colors. Small sacks of &lt;a href=\"quicklime\"&gt;quicklime&lt;/a&gt;, one for each year of the life of the deceased are placed around the body to protect it against impurity in the next world, and white paper flowers are placed around the body.\nIn China and other Asian countries, white is the color of reincarnation, showing that death is not a permanent separation from the world.\nIn China, white is associated with the masculine (the \"yang\" of the \"yin\" and \"yang\"); with the &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;; with the fur of an animal; with the direction of west; with the element metal; and with the &lt;a href=\"autumn\"&gt;autumn&lt;/a&gt; season.\nIn the traditional Japanese religion of &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt;, an area of white gravel or stones marks a sacred place, called a \"niwa\". These places were dedicated to the \"kami\", spirits which had descended from the heavens or had come across the sea. Later, temples of &lt;a href=\"Zen%20Buddhism\"&gt;Zen Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; in Japan often featured a &lt;a href=\"Zen%20garden\"&gt;Zen garden&lt;/a&gt;, where white sand or gravel was carefully raked to resemble rivers or streams, designed as objects of meditation.\nIn Japan, undyed linen white robes are worn by pilgrims for rituals of purification, and bathing in sacred rivers. In the mountains, pilgrims wear costumes of undyed &lt;a href=\"jute\"&gt;jute&lt;/a&gt; to symbolize purity. A white kimono is often placed in the casket with the deceased for the journey to the other world, as white represents death sometimes. Condolence gifts, or \"kooden\", are tied with black and white ribbons and wrapped in white paper, protecting the contents from the impurities of the other world.\nIn India, it is the color of purity, divinity, detachment and serenity. In Hindi, the name Sweta means white.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, white robes were reserved for the lama of a monastery.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Bedouin\"&gt;Bedouin&lt;/a&gt; and some other pastoral cultures, there is a strong connection between milk and white, which is considered the color of gratitude, esteem, joy, good fortune and fertility.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Paganism\"&gt;Paganism&lt;/a&gt;, it is used for peace, innocence, illumination, and purity. It can also be used to stand for any color. White is also associated with cleansing, a Pagan practice that cleans something using the elements. In &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt;, a white-handled knife called the &lt;a href=\"boline\"&gt;boline&lt;/a&gt; is used in rituals.\nPolitical movements.\nWhite is often associated with &lt;a href=\"monarchism\"&gt;monarchism&lt;/a&gt;. The association originally came from the white flag of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bourbon\"&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; dynasty of France. White became the banner of the royalist rebellions against the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Revolt%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; which followed the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1917, the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, nationalists and liberals, fought unsuccessfully against the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt;. A similar battle between reds and whites took place during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20in%20Finland\"&gt;Civil War in Finland&lt;/a&gt; in the same period.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ku%20Klux%20Klan\"&gt;Ku Klux Klan&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"White%20supremacy\"&gt;white supremacist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-immigrant\"&gt;anti-immigrant&lt;/a&gt; organization which flourished in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern United States&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. They wore white robes and hoods, burned crosses and violently attacked and murdered black Americans.\nIn Iran, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Revolution\"&gt;White Revolution&lt;/a&gt; was a series of social and political reforms launched in 1963 by the last &lt;a href=\"Pahlavi%20dynasty\"&gt;Shah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; before his downfall.\nWhite is also associated with peace and passive resistance. The &lt;a href=\"white%20ribbon\"&gt;white ribbon&lt;/a&gt; is worn by movements denouncing &lt;a href=\"violence%20against%20women\"&gt;violence against women&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"White%20Rose\"&gt;White Rose&lt;/a&gt; was a non-violent &lt;a href=\"German%20resistance%20to%20Nazism\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; group in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelected national flags featuring white.\nWhite is a common color in national flags, though its symbolism varies widely. The white in the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;flag of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;flag of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; comes from traditional red &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Cross\"&gt;St George's Cross&lt;/a&gt; on a white background of the historic &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20England\"&gt;flag of England&lt;/a&gt;. The white in the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20France\"&gt;flag of France&lt;/a&gt; represents either the monarchy or \"white, the ancient French color\" according to the &lt;a href=\"Marquis%20de%20Lafayette\"&gt;Marquis de Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany flags in the Arab world use the colors of the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20the%20Arab%20Revolt\"&gt;flag of the Arab Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1916; red, white, green and black. These include the flags of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; also use white as their symbol for unity in &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;their flag&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssociations and symbolism.\nInnocence and sacrifice.\nIn Western culture, white is the color most often associated with innocence, or purity. In the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; and in Temple Judaism, white animals such as lambs were &lt;a href=\"Tamid\"&gt;sacrificed to expiate sins&lt;/a&gt;. The white &lt;a href=\"lily\"&gt;lily&lt;/a&gt; is considered the flower of purity and innocence, and is often associated with the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;. \"Color Wheel Pro\" describes white in association with light, goodness, innocence, purity and virginity. White is also often considered to be the color of perfection. \"colormeaning.com\" says, \"In color psychology, white is the color of new beginnings \u2014 wiping the slate clean. The color white is a blank canvas, just waiting to be written on.\"\nBeginnings.\nWhite is the color in &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western culture&lt;/a&gt; most often associated with beginnings. &lt;a href=\"Christ\"&gt;Christ&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Resurrection%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;the Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; is traditionally portrayed dressed in white. In &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, children are baptized and first take &lt;a href=\"Eucharist\"&gt;communion&lt;/a&gt; wearing white. &lt;a href=\"Baptisms\"&gt;Baptisms&lt;/a&gt; are especially tied to white since the person is making a religious commitment to be pure and clean before God. Religious rites and the clothing associated with them have always been important, and white is often a common color used to express high religious commitment and purity.\nQueen &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; wears white when she opens each session of British Parliament. In &lt;a href=\"High%20society%20%28social%20class%29\"&gt;high society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"debutantes\"&gt;debutantes&lt;/a&gt; traditionally wear &lt;a href=\"Debutante%20dress\"&gt;white dress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"evening%20glove\"&gt;long white gloves&lt;/a&gt; for their first &lt;a href=\"Debutante%20ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;. The appropriate attire for a debutante is a white gown with a full skirt. The dress must be pure white and no other color should be used. &lt;a href=\"Off-white\"&gt;Off-white&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cream%20%28colour%29\"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt; colors are not acceptable.\nDress code.\nA dress code is a set of rules, often written, with regards to what &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; groups of people must wear. White tie, also called full evening dress or a dress suit, is the most &lt;a href=\"formal%20wear\"&gt;formal&lt;/a&gt; in traditional evening &lt;a href=\"western%20dress%20codes\"&gt;western dress codes&lt;/a&gt;. In western countries, a \"formal\" or white tie dress code typically means tailcoats for men and full-length &lt;a href=\"Evening%20gown\"&gt;evening dresses&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"evening%20glove\"&gt;opera-length gloves&lt;/a&gt; for women.\nWeddings.\nWhite has long been the traditional color worn by brides at royal weddings, but the white &lt;a href=\"wedding%20gown\"&gt;wedding gown&lt;/a&gt; for ordinary people appeared in the 19th century. Before that time, most brides wore their best Sunday clothing, of whatever color. The white lace wedding gown of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in 1840 had a large impact on the color and fashion of wedding dresses in both Europe and America down to the present day. Since then, &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western culture&lt;/a&gt; has long followed the tradition of wearing white on one's wedding day. Since the middle of the 20th century, most Western wedding dresses are usually &lt;a href=\"white%20%28colour%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, though \"wedding white\" includes \"&lt;a href=\"Off-white\"&gt;Off-white&lt;/a&gt;\" such as &lt;a href=\"ivory%20%28color%29\"&gt;ivory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beige\"&gt;beige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cream%20%28colour%29\"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt;. The white wedding style was given another significant boost in 1981, when three-quarter billion people\u2014one out of six people around the globe\u2014watched &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Charles, Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20of%20Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales%2C%20and%20Lady%20Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;marry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;Diana Spencer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20dress%20of%20Lady%20Diana%20Spencer\"&gt;her elaborate white taffeta dress&lt;/a&gt; with a 25-foot-long train. This wedding is generally considered the most influential white wedding of the 20th century.\nCleanliness.\nWhite is the color most associated with cleanliness. Objects which are expected to be clean, such as refrigerators and dishes, toilets and sinks, bed linen and towels, are traditionally white. White was the traditional color of the coats of doctors, nurses, scientists and laboratory technicians, though nowadays a pale blue or green is often used. White is also the color most often worn by chefs, bakers, and butchers, and the color of the aprons of waiters in French restaurants.\nGhosts, phantoms and two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\nWhite is the color associated with &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and phantoms. In the past the dead were traditionally buried in a white shroud. Ghosts are said to be the spirits of the dead who, for various reasons, are unable to rest or enter heaven, and so walk the earth in their white shrouds. White is also connected with the paleness of death. A common expression in English is \"pale as a ghost.\"\nThe woman in white, Wei\u00dfe Frau, or \"dame blanche\" is a familiar figure in English, German and French ghost stories. She is a spectral apparition of a female clad in white, in most cases the ghost of an ancestor, sometimes giving warning about death and disaster. The most notable Wei\u00dfe Frau is the legendary ghost of the German &lt;a href=\"Hohenzollern\"&gt;Hohenzollern&lt;/a&gt; dynasty.\nSeeing a white horse in a dream is said to be presentiment of death. In the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;Book of Revelation&lt;/a&gt;, the last book in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; of the Bible, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20of%20the%20Apocalypse\"&gt;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to announce the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Judgement\"&gt;Last Judgement&lt;/a&gt;. The man on a &lt;a href=\"White%20horse%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;white horse&lt;/a&gt; with a bow and arrow, according to different interpretations, represents either War and Conquest, the &lt;a href=\"Antichrist\"&gt;Antichrist&lt;/a&gt;, or Christ himself, cleansing the world of sin. Death rides a horse whose color is described in ancient Greek as \"khl\u014dros\" (&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%CF%87%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%82\"&gt;\u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2&lt;/a&gt;) in the original &lt;a href=\"Koine%20Greek\"&gt;Koine Greek&lt;/a&gt;, which can mean either green/greenish-yellow or pale/pallid.\nOpposite of black.\nBlack and white often represent the contrast between light and darkness, day and night, male and female, good and evil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"taoism\"&gt;taoism&lt;/a&gt;, the two complementary natures of the universe, &lt;a href=\"yin%20and%20yang\"&gt;yin and yang&lt;/a&gt;, are often symbolized in black and white, Ancient games of strategy, such as &lt;a href=\"Go%20%28game%29\"&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, use black and white to represent the two sides.\nIn the French monarchy, white symbolized the King and his power \"par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu\" (\"by the grace of God\") and in contrast black was the color of the queen who according to the Salic Law which excluded women from the throne (and thus from power) could never become the ruling monarch.\nBlack and white also often represent formality and seriousness, as in the costumes of judges and priests, business suits, of formal evening dress. Monks of the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican Order&lt;/a&gt; wear a black cloak over a white habit. Until 1972, agents of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; were informally required by FBI Director &lt;a href=\"J.%20Edgar%20Hoover\"&gt;J. Edgar Hoover&lt;/a&gt; to wear white shirts with their suits, to project the correct image of the FBI.\nNames taken from white.\nWhite is the source of more names for women in western countries than any other color. Names taken from white include Alba, Albine (Latin). Blandine, Blanche and Blanchette (French); Bianca (Italian); Jennifer (Celt); Genevieve, Candice (from Latin Candida); Fenela, Fiona and Finola (Irish); Gwendoline, Gwenael, Nol(g)wen (\"white woman\") (Celt), Nives (Spanish) and Zuria (Basque).\nIn addition many names come from white flowers: Camille, Daisy, Lily, Lili, Magnolie, Jasmine, Yasemine, Leila, Marguerite, Rosalba, and others.\nOther names come from the white &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt;; Pearl, Margarita (Latin), Margaret, Margarethe, Marga, Grete, Rita, Gitta, Marjorie, Margot.\nTemples, churches and government buildings.\nSince ancient times, temples, churches, and many government buildings in many countries have traditionally been white, the color associated with religious and civic virtue. The &lt;a href=\"Parthenon\"&gt;Parthenon&lt;/a&gt; and other ancient temples of Greece, and the buildings of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Forum\"&gt;Roman Forum&lt;/a&gt; were mostly made of or clad in white marble, though it is now known that some of these ancient buildings were actually brightly painted. The Roman tradition of using white stone for government buildings and churches was revived in the Renaissance and especially in the &lt;a href=\"neoclassic%20style\"&gt;neoclassic style&lt;/a&gt; of the 18th and 19th centuries. White stone became the material of choice for government buildings in Washington D.C. and other American cities. European cathedrals were also usually built of white or light-colored stone, though many darkened over the centuries from smoke and soot.\nThe Renaissance architect and scholar &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Battista%20Alberti\"&gt;Leon Battista Alberti&lt;/a&gt; wrote in 1452 that churches should be plastered white on the inside, since white was the only appropriate color for reflection and meditation. Traditional &lt;a href=\"Cistercian%20architecture\"&gt;Cistercian architecture&lt;/a&gt; also places a high emphasis on white for similar reasons. After the Reformation, &lt;a href=\"Calvinist\"&gt;Calvinist&lt;/a&gt; churches in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; were whitewashed and sober inside, a tradition that was also followed in the &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; churches of New England, such as &lt;a href=\"Old%20North%20Church\"&gt;Old North Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthnography.\nPeople of the &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20race\"&gt;Caucasian race&lt;/a&gt; are often referred to simply as white. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; defines &lt;a href=\"white%20people\"&gt;white people&lt;/a&gt; as those \"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who reported \"white\" or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.\" White people constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite flag.\nA &lt;a href=\"white%20flag\"&gt;white flag&lt;/a&gt; has long been used to represent either surrender or a request for a truce. It is believed to have originated in the 15th century, during the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; between France and England, when multicolored flags, as well as firearms, came into common use by European armies. The white flag was officially recognized as a request to cease hostilities by the &lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Convention\"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt; of 1949.\nVexillology and heraldry.\nIn English &lt;a href=\"heraldry\"&gt;heraldry&lt;/a&gt;, white or &lt;a href=\"silver%20%28color%29\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; signified brightness, purity, virtue, and innocence."
