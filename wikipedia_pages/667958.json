    "text": "Central Serbia (), also referred to as Serbia proper (), is the &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of Serbia lying outside the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the disputed territory of &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Central Serbia is a term of convenience, not an &lt;a href=\"administrative%20division%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;administrative division of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; as such, and does not have any form of separate administration.\nBroadly speaking, Central Serbia is the historical core of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Serbia%20%281804%E2%80%931918%29\"&gt;modern Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, which emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Revolution\"&gt;Serbian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; (1804\u201317) and subsequent wars against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In the following century, Serbia gradually expanded south, acquiring South Serbia, Kosovo, &lt;a href=\"Sand%C5%BEak\"&gt;Sand\u017eak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vardar%20Macedonia\"&gt;Vardar Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1918 \u2013 following the unification and annexation of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and unification of &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; areas left of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sava\"&gt;Sava&lt;/a&gt; (Vojvodina) \u2013 it merged with other South Slavic territories into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. The current borders of Central Serbia were defined after World War II, when Serbia became a &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, with Kosovo and Vojvodina as its autonomous provinces.\nGeography.\nCentral Serbia takes up, roughly, the territory of Serbia between the natural borders consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sava\"&gt;Sava&lt;/a&gt; (in the north), the &lt;a href=\"Drina\"&gt;Drina&lt;/a&gt; (in the west), and the \"unnatural\" border to the southwest with &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, south with &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, and to the east with &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, with a small strip of the Danube with Romania in the northeast. The Danube and Sava divides central Serbia from the Serbian province of &lt;a href=\"Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;, while the Drina divides Serbia from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Morava\"&gt;Great Morava&lt;/a&gt;, a major river, goes through central Serbia. Extensions of three major mountain chains are located within Serbia proper: &lt;a href=\"Dinaric%20Alps\"&gt;Dinaric Alps&lt;/a&gt; in the west and south, and the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Carpathians\"&gt;Carpathians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Mountains\"&gt;Balkan Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the east.\nSome notable geographical regions located in central Serbia are: &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0umadija\"&gt;\u0160umadija&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ma%C4%8Dva\"&gt;Ma\u010dva&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Timok%20Valley\"&gt;Timok Valley&lt;/a&gt; (including the &lt;a href=\"Negotin%20Valley\"&gt;Negotin Valley&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Pomoravlje%20%28region%29\"&gt;Pomoravlje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Podunavlje\"&gt;Podunavlje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posavina\"&gt;Posavina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Podrinje\"&gt;Podrinje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zlatibor\"&gt;Zlatibor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra%C5%A1ka%20%28region%29\"&gt;Ra\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n \nIn the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20heritage%20in%20Serbia\"&gt;Roman period&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Moesia\"&gt;Moesia&lt;/a&gt;\" was the name for a region that included Serbia proper. &lt;a href=\"Viminacium\"&gt;Viminacium&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Kostolac\"&gt;Kostolac&lt;/a&gt;) was the capital of the province of &lt;a href=\"Moesia%20Superior\"&gt;Moesia Superior&lt;/a&gt;. Slavs (\"&lt;a href=\"Sclaveni\"&gt;Sclaveni&lt;/a&gt;\") overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. The Serbs, a Slavic tribe, were known to have held the area of what is today southwest Serbia in the Early Middle Ages, while the \"&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Frankish%20Annals\"&gt;Royal Frankish Annals&lt;/a&gt;\" mention the &lt;a href=\"Brani%C4%8Devci\"&gt;Brani\u010devci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Timo%C4%8Dani\"&gt;Timo\u010dani&lt;/a&gt;, in the eastern parts, in the 9th century. &lt;a href=\"Ra%C5%A1ka%20%28region%29\"&gt;Ra\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt;, situated in the southwest, was the core of the medieval Serbian state; &lt;a href=\"Stari%20Ras\"&gt;Stari Ras&lt;/a&gt; has been identified as a capital of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Principality%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Grand Principality of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. Serbia eventually expanded its borders to the east. The area of most of Serbia proper, as well as areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern Montenegro, Kosovo, and northern Macedonia were called \"the Serbian lands\", included in the styles of medieval Serbian rulers. King &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Dragutin\"&gt;Stefan Dragutin&lt;/a&gt; of Syrmia (r. 1282\u20131316) had two capitals, &lt;a href=\"Debrc\"&gt;Debrc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20the%20Serbian%20Empire\"&gt;fall of the Serbian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Moravian%20Serbia\"&gt;Moravian Serbia&lt;/a&gt;\" under &lt;a href=\"Lazar%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Lazar&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1373\u201389) and &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Lazarevi%C4%87\"&gt;Stefan Lazarevi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1389\u20131402) corresponded roughly to Serbia proper. &lt;a href=\"Kru%C5%A1evac\"&gt;Kru\u0161evac&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of Moravian Serbia, until the Ottoman conquests in the 15th century, and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Despotate\"&gt;Serbian Despotate&lt;/a&gt;, with the capital in Belgrade. After the Ottoman conquest of the Serbian Despotate, the &lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Smederevo\"&gt;Sanjak of Smederevo&lt;/a&gt; was established, initially seated in &lt;a href=\"Smederevo\"&gt;Smederevo&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually, in Belgrade after &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281521%29\"&gt;its fall in 1521&lt;/a&gt; (hence called the \"Pashaluk of Belgrade\").\nBetween 1718 and 1739, the Sanjak of Smederevo was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, which administrated the area as the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbia%20%281718-1739%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Militia%20%281718%E2%80%9339%29\"&gt;Serbian Militia&lt;/a&gt; operated throughout Serbia proper during the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Russian%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281735%E2%80%9339%29\"&gt;1737\u201339 war&lt;/a&gt;. The war ended in Ottoman victory, and returning of the sanjak. The northern half of Serbia proper was briefly under &lt;a href=\"Habsburg-occupied%20Serbia%20%281788%E2%80%9392%29\"&gt;Habsburg occupation&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%9391%29\"&gt;1787\u201391 war&lt;/a&gt;, then returned. With the &lt;a href=\"First%20Serbian%20Uprising\"&gt;First Serbian Uprising&lt;/a&gt; (1804\u201313), the sanjak became a \"de facto\" Serbian state, known in historiography as \"&lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Serbia\"&gt;Revolutionary Serbia&lt;/a&gt;\". It was retaken by the Ottomans in 1813, however, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Serbian%20Uprising\"&gt;Second Serbian Uprising&lt;/a&gt; (1815\u201317) saw Serbia recognized as an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. In 1878, Serbia became a fully independent state, also enlarging its territory to the south-east. The 1878 borders correspond to present-day Central Serbia save for small parts in the south-west.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Wars\"&gt;Balkan Wars&lt;/a&gt; (1912\u201313), Serbia further expanded its borders to the south, taking control of much of present-day &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. Further territorial gains were made in the north (today's &lt;a href=\"Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;) and south-west (&lt;a href=\"Sand%C5%BEak\"&gt;Sand\u017eak&lt;/a&gt; region) in 1918, after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Serbia became part of the new &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; on December 1, 1918. Serbia proper did not have a separate political status within the Kingdom; in 1929, when new provinces of the Kingdom were formed, Serbia proper was divided between five \"&lt;a href=\"Banovinas%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;banovine&lt;/a&gt;\", one of which (&lt;a href=\"Morava%20Banovina\"&gt;Morava Banovina&lt;/a&gt;) was established in the east with its capital in &lt;a href=\"Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 1941 and 1944, most of the territory was part of the area governed by the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Administration%20in%20Serbia\"&gt;Military Administration in Serbia&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; occupation with a Serbian puppet government. The southwestern region of &lt;a href=\"Sand%C5%BEak\"&gt;Sand\u017eak&lt;/a&gt; was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and annexed to the neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Italian governorate of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;; southern Kosovo was annexed to &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; while southeastern parts annexed by &lt;a href=\"Military%20history%20of%20Bulgaria%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Axis occupation ended in 1944 with the liberation of Yugoslavia by the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Partisans\"&gt;Yugoslav Partisans&lt;/a&gt;; Serbia was formed as one of the republics of the new socialist &lt;a href=\"SFRY\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1945, Vojvodina and Kosovo became autonomous provinces within Serbia, thus the part of Serbia that was outside these two regions became known as \"u\u017ea Srbija\" (\"Serbia proper\"). At the beginning of the 1990s, the term \"u\u017ea Srbija\" was replaced with the new term \"Centralna Srbija\" (\"Central Serbia\") which was used in all official publications of the Serbian government that referred to the region.\nWith the formation of new &lt;a href=\"statistical%20regions%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;statistical regions of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; in 2009\u201310, three statistical regions: &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0umadija%20and%20Western%20Serbia\"&gt;\u0160umadija and Western Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20and%20Eastern%20Serbia\"&gt;Southern and Eastern Serbia&lt;/a&gt; form Central Serbia.\nAdministrative divisions.\n \n&lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Districts of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href=\"Statistical%20regions%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Statistical regions of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nEthnic groups of Central Serbia according to the 2011 census:\nIn 2011, most of the municipalities of Central Serbia had an ethnic Serb majority, three municipalities (&lt;a href=\"Novi%20Pazar\"&gt;Novi Pazar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tutin%2C%20Serbia\"&gt;Tutin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sjenica\"&gt;Sjenica&lt;/a&gt;) had a Bosniak majority, two municipalities (&lt;a href=\"Bujanovac\"&gt;Bujanovac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pre%C5%A1evo\"&gt;Pre\u0161evo&lt;/a&gt;) had an Albanian majority and two municipalities (&lt;a href=\"Bosilegrad\"&gt;Bosilegrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimitrovgrad%2C%20Serbia\"&gt;Dimitrovgrad&lt;/a&gt;) had a Bulgarian majority."
