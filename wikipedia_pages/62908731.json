    "text": "NW Rota-1 is a &lt;a href=\"seamount\"&gt;seamount&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Rota%20%28island%29\"&gt;Rota&lt;/a&gt;, which was discovered through its &lt;a href=\"Hydrothermal%20circulation\"&gt;hydrothermal&lt;/a&gt; activity in 2003. The volcano has been observed to be &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20eruption\"&gt;erupting underwater&lt;/a&gt;, the first time that submarine &lt;a href=\"explosive%20eruption\"&gt;explosive eruption&lt;/a&gt;s have been directly witnessed.\nThe summit of the seamount lies at below sea level, with a ridge capping off the seamount. It has several &lt;a href=\"Volcanic%20crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt;s, the most active of which is located south of the summit ridge and is called \"Brimstone Pit\". Eruptions have been recorded in 2008\u20132010 and took the form of &lt;a href=\"Strombolian%20eruption\"&gt;Strombolian eruption&lt;/a&gt;s with the emission of lava and large amounts of &lt;a href=\"tephra\"&gt;tephra&lt;/a&gt;. The erupted material is unstable and forms &lt;a href=\"sediment%20flow\"&gt;sediment flow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"landslide\"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt;s; one large landslide occurred on 14 August 2009 and stripped part of the southern flank of NW Rota-1. Such landslides generate ash plumes underwater and are similar to large landslides at other active submarine volcanoes.\nThe activity gives rise to intense hydrothermal plumes, which contain droplets of &lt;a href=\"Sulfur\"&gt;molten sulfur&lt;/a&gt; and bubbles of &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, among other compounds. It is estimated that NW Rota-1 releases 400,000 \u00b1 100,000 tonne/year of carbon dioxide. The hydrothermal activity nourishes &lt;a href=\"microbial%20mat\"&gt;microbial mat&lt;/a&gt;s and these in turn many animals, although the unstable environment from the frequent eruptions limits animal diversity.\nResearch history.\nNW Rota-1 was discovered to be &lt;a href=\"hydrothermal\"&gt;hydrothermal&lt;/a&gt;ly active by &lt;a href=\"NOAA\"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 and first mapped by the &lt;a href=\"remotely%20operated%20vehicle\"&gt;remotely operated vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (ROV) &lt;a href=\"ROPOS\"&gt;ROPOS&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. The volcano has repeatedly been targeted by dives of ROVs. &lt;a href=\"Hydrophone\"&gt;Hydrophone&lt;/a&gt;s have been placed at the summit and vent during several dives. NW Rota-1 is also known as \"Northwest Rota-1\".\nNW Rota-1 is the first volcano where submarine &lt;a href=\"explosive%20eruptions\"&gt;explosive eruptions&lt;/a&gt; were directly observed, in 2004. The intensity of the eruptions is diminished by being underwater, allowing more direct observations than would be possible at subaerial volcanoes.\nGeography and geomorphology.\nNW Rota-1 is located northwest of &lt;a href=\"Rota%20%28island%29\"&gt;Rota&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20the%20Northern%20Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and about north of &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Trench%20Marine%20National%20Monument\"&gt;Mariana Trench Marine National Monument&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 2009.\nNW Rota-1 is a steep volcanic cone, which rises from a wide base at depth to below sea level. The summit and slopes of the volcano are covered by volcanic debris (including ash and sand), &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; globules and &lt;a href=\"Scree\"&gt;talus&lt;/a&gt;. Rock and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; outcrops and cemented &lt;a href=\"breccia\"&gt;breccia&lt;/a&gt; are also found; the outcrops are part of the inner structure of the volcano. The summit is formed by a northwest\u2013southeast trending ridge that probably formed as a headwall of a &lt;a href=\"landslide\"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Normal%20fault\"&gt;Normal fault&lt;/a&gt;s cut across the volcano and bound the summit ridge. An inactive summit is located northwest from the main summit at depth.\nThe active crater \"Brimstone Pit\" lies south of the summit on the steep, debris covered slope of the volcano. A wide depression east of the summit may be an older crater, now partially filled. Farther east lies the \"Fault Shrimp\" ridge, where diffuse hydrothermal venting takes place.\nThe appearance of the \"Brimstone Pit\" has changed over time:\nIn 2010 other active vents appeared below the summit on the southern flank. These are (from west to east) \"Phantom\", \"Sulfur\", \"Styx\" and \"Charon\". They form a long alignment that also contains Brimstone Pit as its middle member. The appearance of these new vents may be due to landslides disrupting the magma conduits.\nLandsliding.\nEvidence of landslides is found over the entire volcano, and sediment flows have been observed from ROVs. They form when material accumulated around vents becomes unstable and collapses. The landslides generate plumes of ash-rich water which can spread kilometres from the volcano. Such plumes are a unique trait of volcanism at NW Rota-1 and have been identified at &lt;a href=\"Kavachi\"&gt;Kavachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monowai%20Seamount\"&gt;Monowai&lt;/a&gt;, NW Rota-1 and &lt;a href=\"West%20Mata\"&gt;West Mata&lt;/a&gt; submarine volcanoes.\nOne such landslide took place on 14 August 2009 and removed debris that had accumulated around Brimstone Pit as well as the southern parts of the summit. Schnur \"et al.\" 2017 gave volume estimates of and but despite this large volume it did not result in a detectable &lt;a href=\"tsunami\"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;. It left rocky outcrops exposed that had previously been buried under looser material.\nCycles of volcano growth and collapse have been found at other seamounts like Monowai and West Mata, and much larger and less frequent collapses are recorded from large &lt;a href=\"Anorogenic%20magmatism\"&gt;intraplate volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Seismic%20activity\"&gt;Seismic activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; changes and &lt;a href=\"hydrothermal%20alteration\"&gt;hydrothermal alteration&lt;/a&gt; appear to play a role in initiating landsliding.\nGeology.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Izu%E2%80%93Bonin%E2%80%93Mariana%20Arc\"&gt;Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Plate\"&gt;Pacific Plate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"subduct\"&gt;subduct&lt;/a&gt;s beneath the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Plate\"&gt;Philippine Plate&lt;/a&gt;. The subduction of the old Pacific Plate releases fluids from the downgoing &lt;a href=\"slab%20%28geology%29\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"mantle%20%28geology%29\"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt;. The interaction between these fluids and the mantle fertilizes the latter and results in volcanic activity. Compared to ocean island volcanoes, these volcanoes are longer lived and produce more gas-rich magma.\nThe Mariana Arc contains 52-60 &lt;a href=\"submarine%20volcano\"&gt;submarine volcano&lt;/a&gt;es, about five times more than rise above sea level. At least 20 volcanoes including NW Rota-1 are hydrothermally active. The islands Guam, Rota and &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; are uplifted parts of the &lt;a href=\"forearc\"&gt;forearc&lt;/a&gt;.\nNW Rota-1 is part of South Mariana Seamount Province. It is the western end and largest member of a chain of four large and five smaller submarine volcanoes. This \"cross-chain\" is perpendicular to the main &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20arc\"&gt;volcanic arc&lt;/a&gt; and is correlated to a &lt;a href=\"slab%20%28geology%29\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; discontinuity. The cross-chain lies in an area of &lt;a href=\"crust%20%28geology%29\"&gt;crust&lt;/a&gt;al extension. Another volcano close to NW Rota-1 is Chaife, about east-northeast of the former. &lt;a href=\"Esmeralda%20Bank\"&gt;Esmeralda Bank&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"caldera\"&gt;caldera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"West%20Rota\"&gt;West Rota&lt;/a&gt; lie northwest and due south of NW Rota-1, respectively. There might be a shallow &lt;a href=\"magma%20chamber\"&gt;magma chamber&lt;/a&gt; at NW Rota-1, which could explain the vigorous hydrothermal activity.\nComposition.\nThe volcano is formed by &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basaltic%20andesite\"&gt;basaltic andesite&lt;/a&gt;. The volcanic rocks define a &lt;a href=\"calc-alkaline\"&gt;calc-alkaline&lt;/a&gt; rock family with some components that border on the &lt;a href=\"tholeiitic\"&gt;tholeiitic&lt;/a&gt; family. The rock family has a medium &lt;a href=\"potassium\"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; content. &lt;a href=\"Phenocryst\"&gt;Phenocryst&lt;/a&gt; phases contained in the rocks are &lt;a href=\"olivine\"&gt;olivine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plagioclase\"&gt;plagioclase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pyroxene\"&gt;pyroxene&lt;/a&gt;. Sulfur has been found encased in ejecta, which are often covered in &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20glass\"&gt;volcanic glass&lt;/a&gt; from the interaction between seawater and lava. Volcanic rocks are &lt;a href=\"porphyritic\"&gt;porphyritic&lt;/a&gt; and contain many vesicles. The magma erupted at NW Rota-1 is among the most water rich of the entire Mariana Arc.\nThe formation of NW Rota-1 magmas appears to involve the melting of subducted, water-bearing sediments and the interaction of the resulting melts with the &lt;a href=\"mantle%20wedge\"&gt;mantle wedge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Back-arc\"&gt;Back-arc&lt;/a&gt; may also play a role. The interaction products rise as &lt;a href=\"diapir\"&gt;diapir&lt;/a&gt;s in two distinct populations, one with a large sediment component and one with a small one. Eventually liquids separate from crystals in the diapir and rise to the surface.\nExhalations.\nLike other volcanoes, NW Rota-1 emits &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"methane\"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; () and water. The volcano produces about 400,000 \u00b1 100,000 of , which is about 0.2\u20130.6% of the worldwide &lt;a href=\"flux\"&gt;flux&lt;/a&gt; at subaerial volcanoes.\nThe particle-rich plumes and most exhalations originate from Brimstone Pit crater; however, diffuse degassing at the summit generates hydrothermal plumes as well. Because the water in the plumes is warmer than surrounding seawater, it rises under its own buoyancy about above the vents. The water in the plumes is acidic and enriched in &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; isotope &lt;a href=\"helium-3\"&gt;helium-3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"manganese\"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"phosphorus\"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silicon\"&gt;silicon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; are enriched in the plumes. The composition of the plumes depends on the location of their vents and changes during their ascent.\nThe carbon dioxide forms clear bubbles, which consist of about 90% and 10% . These bubbles are on average wide and quickly rise owing to their buoyancy. Some vents continuously emit carbon dioxide bubbles, others only cyclically. Sulfur is generated by the mixture of sulfur-containing gases with water and forms droplets of liquid sulfur. Sulfur globules form from such droplets; they cover the ground like a powdery dusting and have been recovered from the surfaces of ROVs. Sulfur accumulating in the slopes forms agglomerates and crusts which cement the slopes, reducing their instability.\nNW Rota-1 also emits &lt;a href=\"aluminium%20sulfate\"&gt;aluminium sulfate&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Aluminium%20phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"alunite\"&gt;alunite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Woodhouseite\"&gt;woodhousite&lt;/a&gt; group minerals, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20oxide\"&gt;iron oxyhydroxydes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first volcano known to vent alunite minerals. These compounds appear to originate both through direct venting from the volcano, interactions with seawater and the interaction of the exhalations with the volcanic rocks.\nBiology.\nVents above Brimstone Pit and on the eastern ridge are covered with &lt;a href=\"microbial%20mat\"&gt;microbial mat&lt;/a&gt;s and these in turn are frequented by animals such as &lt;a href=\"copepod\"&gt;copepod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"limpet\"&gt;limpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polychaete\"&gt;polychaete&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shrimp\"&gt;shrimp&lt;/a&gt;. The microbial mats are &lt;a href=\"chemoautotrophic\"&gt;chemoautotrophic&lt;/a&gt;. These animals feed not only on the microbial mats but also on other animals killed by the volcanic activity. There are no sessile animals other than rare limpets, presumably due to the intense volcanism and unstable conditions. A larger animal community has been found at the northwestern summit; it includes &lt;a href=\"amphipod\"&gt;amphipod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sea%20anemone\"&gt;anenome&lt;/a&gt;s, copepods, crabs, fish, &lt;a href=\"isopod\"&gt;isopod&lt;/a&gt;s, jellyfish, &lt;a href=\"ostracod\"&gt;ostracod&lt;/a&gt;s and polychaetes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"caridean%20shrimp\"&gt;caridean shrimp&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Alvinocaris%20marimonte\"&gt;Alvinocaris marimonte&lt;/a&gt;\" was discovered from populations on NW Rota-1, &lt;a href=\"My%C5%8Djin-sh%C5%8D\"&gt;Myojin Knoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NW%20Eifuku%20seamount\"&gt;NW Eifuku seamount&lt;/a&gt;. The animals found at NW Rota-1 and NW Eifuku have a distinct appearance. Other animals from NW Rota-1 are the limpet \"&lt;a href=\"Shinkailepas\"&gt;Shinkailepas&lt;/a&gt; sp.\", the copepods \"&lt;a href=\"Ameira\"&gt;Ameira&lt;/a&gt; sp.\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ameiropsis%20minor\"&gt;Ameiropsis minor&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Amphiascus%20minutus\"&gt;Amphiascus minutus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Cyclopina\"&gt;Cyclopina&lt;/a&gt; sp.\", \"&lt;a href=\"Halectinosoma%20angulifrons\"&gt;Halectinosoma angulifrons&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Tisbe%20furcata\"&gt;Tisbe furcata&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Bresilioidea\"&gt;bresiliid&lt;/a&gt; shrimp \"&lt;a href=\"Opaepele%20loihi\"&gt;Opaepele loihi&lt;/a&gt;\", the crab \"&lt;a href=\"Gandalfus%20yunohana\"&gt;Gandalfus yunohana&lt;/a&gt;\" and the polychaete \"&lt;a href=\"Branchinotogluma\"&gt;Branchinotogluma&lt;/a&gt; sp.\".\nThe communities south of the summit were decimated by the 2009 landslide. The reduction of activity after 2010 allowed the communities to expand, and new species appeared.\nEruption history and activity.\nThe Brimstone Pit crater is probably a recent vent, given its small size. The rocky outcrops are older. The structure of the volcanic deposits suggests that long pauses between eruptions are rare at NW Rota-1.\nEruptions took place in 2004, 2005, 2006 \u2013 each of the eruptions occurred in a different physical context and with different characteristics \u2013 2009 and 2010. Activity appears to be continuous but variable over this time and until 2014 - when a ROV dive found no activity - each dive to NW Rota-1 found the volcano in eruption:\nThe eruptions at Brimstone Pit resemble &lt;a href=\"Strombolian%20eruption\"&gt;Strombolian eruption&lt;/a&gt;s on land, with a similar high gas flow and low magma supply. In such eruptions, each burst corresponds to the arrival of bubble-rich melt at the vent. The gas accumulates in the debris-blocked conduit and pressurizes it, until the pressure clears the blockage and a plume escapes. Volcanic bombs and debris are ejected during the eruptions and cover the slopes of the volcano.\nContact between seawater and magma causes brief &lt;a href=\"steam%20explosion\"&gt;steam explosion&lt;/a&gt;s. This is followed by the abrupt condensation of the steam and the collapse of bubbles, which are recorded by hydrophones as pulsating sounds. Water-magma interaction also produces &lt;a href=\"pyroclastic\"&gt;pyroclastic&lt;/a&gt;s or alters them after they have been ejected. The eruptions appear to be part of a long-term eruption during which cones form and collapse at Brimstone Pit and water in the magma drives explosive bursts.\nEruptions at NW Rota-1 did not breach the surface and are unlikely to do so in the future. If not for fortuitous observations the activity of NW Rota-1 would not have been discovered.\nHydrophone records.\nIn 2008 and 2009, hydrophones recorded a cyclical activity, with bursts of acoustic signals lasting one to several minutes separated by pauses less than a minute long. Each burst consisted of hundreds of pulses, each several tenths of a second long. An intense acoustic signal recorded between 12 and 16 August 2009 exhibited high amplitudes and low frequencies, with two distinct pulses on 14 August 2009. This signal has been interpreted as an intense explosive eruption which led to the landslide on 14 August 2009. After the landslide the volcano became acoustically quiet for some time before sound levels increased again. Between 2009 and 2010 hydrophones recorded numerous acoustic signals, reflecting the steady eruptions, and &lt;a href=\"tremor\"&gt;tremor&lt;/a&gt;s which may originate in the magmatic conduit although most of the acoustic signals appear to come from the vent. Apart from an increased amplitude in the burst cycles, the acoustic signal in 2010 was similar to that of 2009."
