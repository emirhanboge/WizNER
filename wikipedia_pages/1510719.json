    "text": "The Dacian Draco was the standard ensign of troops of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dacians\"&gt;Dacian&lt;/a&gt; people, which can be seen in the hands of the soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Decebalus\"&gt;Decebalus&lt;/a&gt; in several scenes depicted on &lt;a href=\"Trajan%27s%20Column\"&gt;Trajan's Column&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. This &lt;a href=\"Wind%20instrument\"&gt;Wind instrument&lt;/a&gt; has the form of a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; with open wolf-like jaws containing several metal tongues. The hollow dragon's head was mounted on a pole with a fabric tube affixed at the rear. In use, the \"draco\" was held up into the wind, or above the head of a horseman, where it filled with air and gave the impression it was alive while making a shrill sound as the wind passed through its strips of material.\nName and etymology.\n\"Draco\" (&lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Drakon\" (&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;) mean \"serpent\", \"dragon\". The root of these words means \"to watch\" or \"to guard with a sharp eye\". It is a derivative of Greek \"drak\u014dn\" \"gazing\" .\nOrigins.\nThe origin of the standard is unknown and still a matter of dispute among scholars. A specific and certain origin is still difficult to be determined. Dacian, Thracian, &lt;a href=\"Scythians\"&gt;Scythian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarmatians\"&gt;Sarmatian&lt;/a&gt; or Parthian origins have been proposed in dedicated historiography. According to &lt;a href=\"Lucre%C5%A3iu%20Mih%C4%83ilescu-B%C3%AErliba\"&gt;Lucre\u0163iu Mih\u0103ilescu-B\u00eerliba&lt;/a&gt; by the 2nd century AD, i.e. after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Trajan%27s%20Dacian%20Wars\"&gt;Dacian Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the draco symbol was assimilated in the Greco-Roman world with the Dacian ethnos. According to Jon N. C. Coulston the Romans associated this standard with 1st and 2nd century &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danubian&lt;/a&gt; barbarians. The Roman historian &lt;a href=\"Arrian\"&gt;Arrian&lt;/a&gt; wrote that the Romans took the \"draco\" from the Scythians, most probably a term for the contemporary Sarmatians. It is possible that the serpent or dragon theme was the result of early cartography of the Carpathian mountain range, which resembles a dragon or serpent, facing the west with its tail the black sea.\nIt should be noted, however, that the symbol adopted by the Roman Empire as Draco is not that of the Dacians with the head of a wolf, but that of the Sarmatians with the head of a crested dragon, as we can see in the discovery of the Roman cavalry Draco in Niederbieber (D). In fact, the Dacian Draco and the Sarmatian Draco are different: the Dacian one shows a wolf with open jaws with straight ears, while that of the Sarmatians is a Dragon with sharp teeth, without ears, scaled, with an open mouth and a crest on the head.\nThe original purpose was probably to provide wind direction for archery.\nSignificance.\nAmong the Dacians, the \"draco\" was undoubtedly seen by the &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20warfare\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; as a special protective symbol, while it also played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"Getae-Dacians%20%28Thracians%29%20Religion\"&gt;religious life&lt;/a&gt; of the people.\nThe \"draco\" shows a religious &lt;a href=\"syncretism\"&gt;syncretism&lt;/a&gt; between the wolf and the dragon as well as the serpent. It was supposed to encourage the &lt;a href=\"Dacians\"&gt;Dacians&lt;/a&gt; and to scare their enemies.\nBy the time of the phase D of &lt;a href=\"Hallstatt%20Period\"&gt;Hallstatt Period&lt;/a&gt; (8th\u20136th century BC), the decorative pattern of a dragon head or a serpent had become quite common in &lt;a href=\"Dacia\"&gt;Dacia&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"La%20T%C3%A8ne%20Period\"&gt;La T\u00e8ne Period&lt;/a&gt; (3thBC\u20131st century AD), it served as a standard for the Dacians. \nThe image of the \"draco\" appears on a 4th-century BC ceramic piece discovered at &lt;a href=\"Budureasca\"&gt;Budureasca&lt;/a&gt; commune, &lt;a href=\"Prahova%20county\"&gt;Prahova county&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. \nDacian Draco in warfare.\nDacians marched into the battle accompanied by the howl of wolf-headed trumpets and following their sinister multicolored dragon-head standard. As intended, they made a terrifying audiovisual spectacle.\nThe \"draco\" first appears on Trajan's Column in Rome, a monument that depicts the Dacian wars of 101\u2013102 AD and 105\u2013106 AD. German historian &lt;a href=\"Conrad%20Cichorius\"&gt;Conrad Cichorius&lt;/a&gt; notes that, even though Dacians carry the \"draco\", it was called the &lt;a href=\"Scythians\"&gt;Scythian&lt;/a&gt; \"draco\" in &lt;a href=\"Arrian\"&gt;Arrian&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Tactica%20of%20Arrian\"&gt;Tactica&lt;/a&gt;\" written around 136 AD. According to &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Minns\"&gt;Ellis Minns&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon standards of the Arrian were those of the Dacians.\nRepresentations of the Dacian Draco.\nTrajan's Column in Rome.\nOn Trajan's Column (113 AD), Dacian soldiers are represented carrying a \"draco\" in 20 scenes. One depicts the \"draco\" borne by &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20cavalry\"&gt;Dacian cavalry&lt;/a&gt; crossing the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; by swimming with their horses. In another, the \"draco\" is planted in the center of a &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20citadel\"&gt;Dacian citadel&lt;/a&gt; and surrounded by the skulls of several &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; prisoners. On Trajan's Column the draco is the symbolic image of victory although it is absent from pictures on the column that illustrate &lt;a href=\"Second%20Dacian%20War\"&gt;Trajan's second war against the Dacians&lt;/a&gt;, when the Romans conquered about 18 \u2105 of Dacia territories in quest for gold to pay their legions .\nRoman coins of Dacia.\nThe \"draco\" appears on coins of Roman Emperor &lt;a href=\"Antoninus%20Pius\"&gt;Antoninus Pius&lt;/a&gt; (r.138\u2013161 AD), indicating that it was still the characteristic emblem in the 2nd century. In AD 250 on a coin of &lt;a href=\"Decius\"&gt;Decius&lt;/a&gt; the Roman province of Dacia holds a wolf- or hound-dragon standard. The same type also occurs on antoniniani coins of &lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Gothicus\"&gt;Claudius Gothicus&lt;/a&gt; (r.268\u2013270) and &lt;a href=\"Aurelian\"&gt;Aurelian&lt;/a&gt; (r.270\u2013275).\nArch of Galerius in Thessaloniki.\nThe characteristic Dacian dragon emblem is carried by a group of Dacian horsemen depicted on the &lt;a href=\"Arch%20of%20Galerius%20and%20Rotunda\"&gt;Arch of Galerius and Rotunda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thessaloniki\"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;, Greece.\nFunerary sculptured monument of Chester.\nA draco (considered in 1955 by &lt;a href=\"R.%20P.%20Wright\"&gt;R. P. Wright&lt;/a&gt; of Dacian or Sarmatian type) is depicted on a large stone found at &lt;a href=\"Deva%20Victrix\"&gt;Deva Victrix&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chester\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;, UK) in the North Wall (West) in 1890. The dragon flag is represented horizontally, as held by the cavalryman but its head is not visible, because the stone is rather deteriorated. Most scholars consider the horseman is a Sarmatian, wearing a Sarmatian helmet and carrying a Sarmatian standard. According to Mih\u0103ilescu-B\u00eerliba (2009) the depiction of the Dacian standard is certain and similar representations can be observed on the most important monuments of the Roman triumph over Dacians. A military diploma (dated to 146 AD) found at Chester mentions among the units of the released soldiers the name of &lt;a href=\"cohors%20I%20Aelia%20Dacorum\"&gt;cohors I Aelia Dacorum&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the horseman depicted on the tombstone at Chester could be a &lt;a href=\"Dacian%20cavalryman\"&gt;Dacian cavalryman&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to a &lt;a href=\"vexillatio\"&gt;vexillatio&lt;/a&gt; of cohors I Aelia Dacorum. &lt;a href=\"P.%20A.%20Holder\"&gt;P. A. Holder&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the cohort was created in 102 or a little earlier, with Dacians settled in the Empire, and it received the name of Aelia later.\nHowever, some authors question the attribution of the stele to a Dacian warrior. The Draco was not the exclusive symbol of the Dacians, but of the Sarmatians too. The Dacians usually wore a soft Phrygian cap, but in the stele, the cavalryman wears a tall and conical &lt;a href=\"Spangenhelm\"&gt;Spangenhelm&lt;/a&gt;-type helmet of Sarmatian origin. Some metal helmets of Dacian origin have been found, and they are considerably different from the one represented on the stele. The Dacians presumably wore long loose hair and thick beards, but the Chester cavalryman appears beardless and with short hair. The Dacians were characterized by the curved sickle sword as a peculiar element of the armament, but the cavalryman of Chester carries a straight sword. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Cohors%20I%20Aelia%20Dacorum\"&gt;Cohors I Aelia Dacorum&lt;/a&gt; reported as evidence for the presence of the Dacians in Britain was an infantry unit, and the Dacians had no tradition as a cavalry one. There also were no Dacian units in service at the Castrum of &lt;a href=\"Deva%20Victrix\"&gt;Deva Victrix&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chester\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;), where the stele was found.\nDacian Draco as adopted by the Roman army after 106 AD.\nThe first sculptural representation of a \"draco\" borne by a Roman soldier dates from the time of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Aurelius\"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; (r.161 to 180 AD).\nScholars believe that the \"draco\" was adopted by the Roman army following their conquest of the Dacians. Some scholars such as Osborne (1985) and Ashmore (1961) consider that the draco was adopted by the Romans from the Dacians. It became the standard of the &lt;a href=\"cohort%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;cohort&lt;/a&gt; in the same way that the &lt;a href=\"Aquila%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;aquila&lt;/a&gt; or Imperial eagle was the standard of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20legion\"&gt;Roman legion&lt;/a&gt;. The adopted standard in the Roman cavalry was borne by a &lt;a href=\"draconarius\"&gt;draconarius&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the \"draco\" became an imperial ensign.\nThe \"draco\" was specific not only to Roman occupied Dacia but also to the &lt;a href=\"Sarmatian\"&gt;Sarmatian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parthia\"&gt;Parthia&lt;/a&gt;n regions. As a result, some alternative origins for the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20army\"&gt;Roman army&lt;/a&gt;'s \"draco\" have been proposed. According to &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Altheim\"&gt;Franz Altheim&lt;/a&gt;, the appearance of such ensigns in the Roman army coincided with the recruitment of nomad troops from Central and Southern Asia, and it was from this region that the image passed into Iran and subsequently to Europe. Thus, based on Altheim's theory, the Dacians and &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20people\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; would then have inherited it from the Sarmatian people.\nCompared to those of the Dacians and Romans, the &lt;a href=\"Sarmatian%20Draco\"&gt;Sarmatian Draco&lt;/a&gt; was more Oriental in appearance with prominent ears, dog-like teeth and even fins. It did not usually have scales or the distinctive crest of the dragon-like gilded head of a late Roman standard found at &lt;a href=\"Niederbieber\"&gt;Niederbieber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Its head may have been represented by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"simurgh\"&gt;simurgh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 half-wolf, half-bird. Based on the clan's totem, could have been a fish head as well. On the Trajan's Column, Sarmatian Roxalani horsemen, don't carry a Draco at all.\nThe heads of the Dacian draco-standards represented on Trajan's column are also canine. But, they are of an entirely different type, having short, round-nosed muzzles, protruding eyes, upright ears, gaping, circular jaws and no-gill fins.\nMih\u0103ilescu-B\u00eerliba (2009) suggests that at the end of the 1st century A. D., the Romans associated the \"draco\" with Dacians. Draco was an icon symbolizing the Dacians (as was the Dacian falx).\nVotive tablets.\nA \"draco\" banner is carried by one of the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Riders\"&gt;Danubian Riders&lt;/a&gt;, native Dacian deities, on a Danubian plaque ascribed to the first two decades of the 4th century. Because of the great importance of this symbol in the religious and military life of the Dacians, some writers believe that the \"draco\" must have been directly adopted and reproduced on the so-called &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20plaques\"&gt;Danubian plaques&lt;/a&gt; dating to the 3rd\u20134th centuries. According to some researchers such as &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20Tudor\"&gt;Dumitru Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, the presence of this military ensign on the Danubian plaques is explained simply as due to chance \u2014 the result of a fortuitous combination of horseman and sky-god themes through the imagination of native sculptors.\nCopies.\nThe only copy left is a dragon-like gilded head of the late Roman standard found at the &lt;a href=\"Niederbieber\"&gt;Niederbieber&lt;/a&gt;, Germany.\nLegacy.\nThe \"draco\" was generally introduced in the 4th century as a Roman standard. When &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt; placed the Christian symbol on military ensigns instead of the dragon, the name outlived the change, and the standard-bearer remained the \"&lt;a href=\"draconarius\"&gt;draconarius&lt;/a&gt;\". Sometimes the ancient symbol is found joined to the new, the dragon being placed beneath the cross.\nThe cavalrymen of the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Carolingian dynasty&lt;/a&gt; continued raising the \"draco\" previously adopted by the Roman Empire over their forces in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries.\nDraco probably continued in use in Sub-Roman and Anglo-Saxon Britain; the Bayeux tapestry has Harold's standard bearer holding one. \nThe legendary King Arthur and his knights may have their origins in the Saramatian heavy cavalryman stationed in Britain, the surname \"Pendragon\" borne by Arthur and his father Uther may refer to draco standard.\nThe Red Dragon on the modern Welsh national flag may derive from the draco carried by Roman, and presumably Romano British cavalry units stationed in Britain, i.e. the Sarmatians stationed in Ribchester.\nArt and literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Michel-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dandr%C3%A9-Bardon\"&gt;Michel-Fran\u00e7ois Dandr\u00e9-Bardon&lt;/a&gt; included the Dacian Draco in his \"&lt;a href=\"Costume%20des%20anciens%20peuples%2C%20%C3%A0%20l%27usage%20des%20artistes\"&gt;Costume des anciens peuples, \u00e0 l'usage des artistes&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Romanian artist &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Nicolae\"&gt;Adam Nicolae&lt;/a&gt; created the sculpture \"Steagul Dacic\" 'The Dacian Flag' that can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Or%C4%83%C8%99tie\"&gt;Or\u0103\u0219tie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Saxon ethnographer &lt;a href=\"Teutsch\"&gt;Teutsch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transylvanian\"&gt;Transylvanian&lt;/a&gt; Romanians may have inherited something of the \"snake-cult\" of the ancient Dacians, who are known to have had a dragon (or snake) as a \"victory banner\". He mentions that some doorknockers are shaped like snake heads (protective ones in this case). Furthermore, in Romanian villages in the &lt;a href=\"Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt;'s region surveyed by Teutsch, the vaults of certain gates bear snakes carved in the shape of garlands with their ends representing the \"sun-wheel\".\nMythology.\nAccording to historian &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20P%C3%A2rvan\"&gt;Vasile P\u00e2rvan&lt;/a&gt;, the Dacian war flag, representing a wolf with a serpent's body, depicted the \"&lt;a href=\"balaur\"&gt;balaur&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"balaur\" is not identical to the other creature of &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20myth\"&gt;Romanian myth&lt;/a&gt;., the \"&lt;a href=\"zmeu\"&gt;zmeu&lt;/a&gt;\". The biggest difference is that the \"&lt;a href=\"zmeu\"&gt;zmeu&lt;/a&gt;\", even if it has some lizard features, nevertheless is a human-like figure, while the \"balaur\" is the true form of the dragon. Usually, in all Romanian myths, legends and fairy tales, the \"balaur\" always has three, five, seven, nine or twelve heads. The \"balaur\" sometimes is a malefic figure, but most of the times is a neutral figure, guarding various places, objects or knowledge. Also, in various myths and lore, there will be a series of dragons that have to be defeated in order to obtain the precious objects or entrance to the guarded places, usually three dragons, with scales of iron, silver and respectively gold, or silver, gold and respectively diamond, each stronger than the previous one, the number of their heads increasing with the difficulty.\nSome motifs developed in the folk tradition that defines the snake as protective of the household correspond, to some extent, to the interpretation of a protective Dacian \"Dragon\" symbol."
