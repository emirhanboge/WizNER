    "text": "Synechococcus (from the Greek \"synechos\", in succession, and the Greek \"kokkos\", granule) is a unicellular &lt;a href=\"cyanobacterium\"&gt;cyanobacterium&lt;/a&gt; that is very widespread in the &lt;a href=\"marine%20habitats\"&gt;marine environment&lt;/a&gt;. Its size varies from 0.8 to 1.5\u00a0&lt;a href=\"micrometre\"&gt;\u00b5m&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"photosynthetic\"&gt;photosynthetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coccus\"&gt;coccoid cells&lt;/a&gt; are preferentially found in well\u2013lit &lt;a href=\"surface%20water\"&gt;surface water&lt;/a&gt;s where it can be very abundant (generally 1,000 to 200,000 cells per ml). Many &lt;a href=\"fresh%20water\"&gt;freshwater&lt;/a&gt; species of \"Synechococcus\" have also been described.\nThe &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; of \"S. elongatus\" strain PCC7002 has a size of 3,008,047 &lt;a href=\"base%20pair\"&gt;bp&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the oceanic strain WH8102 has a genome of size 2.4\u00a0Mbp.\nIntroduction.\n\"Synechococcus\" is one of the most important components of the &lt;a href=\"prokaryote\"&gt;prokaryotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"autotroph\"&gt;autotroph&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"picoplankton\"&gt;picoplankton&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"tropics\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; oceans. The genus was first described in 1979, and was originally defined to include \"small unicellular cyanobacteria with ovoid to cylindrical cells that reproduce by binary traverse fission in a single plane and lack sheaths\". This definition of the genus \"Synechococcus\" contained organisms of considerable genetic diversity and was later subdivided into subgroups based on the presence of the accessory pigment &lt;a href=\"phycoerythrin\"&gt;phycoerythrin&lt;/a&gt;. The marine forms of \"Synechococcus\" are coccoid cells between 0.6 and 1.6\u00a0\u00b5m in size. They are &lt;a href=\"Gram-negative\"&gt;Gram-negative&lt;/a&gt; cells with highly structured cell walls that may contain projections on their surface. Electron microscopy frequently reveals the presence of phosphate inclusions, &lt;a href=\"glycogen\"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt; granules, and more importantly, highly structured &lt;a href=\"carboxysome\"&gt;carboxysome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCells are known to be &lt;a href=\"motile\"&gt;motile&lt;/a&gt; by a gliding method and a novel uncharacterized, nonphototactic swimming method that does not involve flagellar motion. While some cyanobacteria are capable of &lt;a href=\"photoheterotroph\"&gt;photoheterotroph&lt;/a&gt;ic or even &lt;a href=\"chemoheterotrophic\"&gt;chemoheterotrophic&lt;/a&gt; growth, all marine \"Synechococcus\" strains appear to be obligate photoautotrophs that are capable of supporting their nitrogen requirements using nitrate, ammonia, or in some cases &lt;a href=\"urea\"&gt;urea&lt;/a&gt; as a sole nitrogen source. Marine \"Synechococcus\" species are traditionally not thought to fix nitrogen.\nIn the last decade, several strains of \"Synechococcus elongatus\" have been produced in laboratory environments to include the fastest growing cyanobacteria to date, \"Synechococcus elongatus\" UTEX 2973. \"S. elongatus UTEX 2973\" is a mutant hybrid from UTEX 625 and is most closely related to S. elongatus PCC 7942 with 99.8% similarity (Yu et al, 2015). It has the shortest doubling time at \u201c1.9 hours in a BG11 medium at 41\u00b0C under continuous 500 \u03bcmoles photons\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121 white light with 3% CO2\u201d (Racharaks et al, 2019).\nPigments.\nThe main photosynthetic pigment in \"Synechococcus\" is &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll%20a\"&gt;chlorophyll a&lt;/a&gt;, while its major accessory pigments are &lt;a href=\"phycobiliprotein\"&gt;phycobiliprotein&lt;/a&gt;. The four commonly recognized &lt;a href=\"phycobilin\"&gt;phycobilin&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"phycocyanin\"&gt;phycocyanin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allophycocyanin\"&gt;allophycocyanin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allophycocyanin%20B\"&gt;allophycocyanin B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"phycoerythrin\"&gt;phycoerythrin&lt;/a&gt;. In addition \"Synechococcus\" also contains &lt;a href=\"zeaxanthin\"&gt;zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt; but no diagnostic pigment for this organism is known. Zeaxanthin is also found in \"&lt;a href=\"Prochlorococcus\"&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"red%20algae\"&gt;red algae&lt;/a&gt; and as a minor pigment in some &lt;a href=\"Chlorophyta\"&gt;chlorophytes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"eustigmatophyte\"&gt;eustigmatophyte&lt;/a&gt;s. Similarly, phycoerythrin is also found in &lt;a href=\"Red%20algae\"&gt;rhodophytes&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"cryptomonad\"&gt;cryptomonad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPhylogeny.\n&lt;a href=\"Phylogenetics\"&gt;Phylogenetic&lt;/a&gt; description of \"Synechococcus\" is difficult. Isolates are &lt;a href=\"Morphology%20%28biology%29\"&gt;morphologically&lt;/a&gt; very similar, yet exhibit a &lt;a href=\"GC-content\"&gt;G+C content&lt;/a&gt; ranging from 39 to 71%, illustrating the large genetic diversity of this provisional taxon. Initially, attempts were made to divide the group into three subclusters, each with a specific range of genomic G+C content. The observation that open-ocean isolates alone nearly span the complete G+C spectrum, however, indicates that \"Synechococcus\" is composed of at least several species. \"Bergey's Manual\" (Herdman \"et al.\" 2001) now divides \"Synechococcus\" into five clusters (equivalent to genera) based on morphology, physiology, and genetic traits.\nCluster 1 includes relatively large (1\u20131.5\u00a0\u00b5m) nonmotile obligate photoautotrophs that exhibit low salt tolerance. Reference strains for this cluster are PCC6301 (formerly \"Anacycstis nidulans\") and PCC6312, which were isolated from fresh water in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Cluster 2 also is characterized by low salt tolerance. Cells are obligate photoautrotrophs, lack phycoerythrin, and are thermophilic. The reference strain PCC6715 was isolated from a hot spring in &lt;a href=\"Yellowstone%20National%20Park\"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Cluster 3 includes phycoerythrin-lacking marine \"Synechococcus\" species that are &lt;a href=\"euryhaline\"&gt;euryhaline&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. capable of growth in both marine and freshwater environments. Several strains, including the reference strain PCC7003, are facultative heterotrophs and require &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20B12\"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; for growth. Cluster 4 contains a single isolate, PCC7335. This strain is obligate marine. This strain contains phycoerthrin and was first isolated from the &lt;a href=\"intertidal%20zone\"&gt;intertidal zone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Pe%C3%B1asco\"&gt;Puerto Pe\u00f1asco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The last cluster contains what had previously been referred to as \u2018marine A and B clusters\u2019 of \"Synechococcus\". These cells are truly marine and have been isolated from both the coastal and the open ocean. All strains are obligate photoautrophs and are around 0.6\u20131.7\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter. This cluster is, however, further divided into a population that either contains (cluster 5.1) or does not contain (cluster 5.2) phycoerythrin. The reference strains are WH8103 for the phycoerythrin-containing strains and WH5701 for those strains that lack this pigment.\nMore recently, Badger \"et al.\" (2002) proposed the division of the cyanobacteria into a \u03b1- and a \u03b2-subcluster based on the type of &lt;a href=\"RuBisCO%20large%20subunit\"&gt;rbcL&lt;/a&gt; (large subunit of &lt;a href=\"RuBisCO\"&gt;ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase&lt;/a&gt;) found in these organisms. \u03b1-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IA, while \u03b2-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IB of this gene. In support for this division Badger \"et al.\" analyze the phylogeny of carboxysomal proteins, which appear to support this division. Also, two particular &lt;a href=\"bicarbonate%20transport\"&gt;bicarbonate transport&lt;/a&gt; systems appear to only be found in \u03b1-cyanobacteria, which lack carboxysomal carbonic anhydrases.\nThe complete &lt;a href=\"phylogenetic%20tree\"&gt;phylogenetic tree&lt;/a&gt; of 16S rRNA sequences of \"Synechococcus\" revealed at least 12 groups, which morphologically correspond to \"Synechococcus\", but they have not derived from the common ancestor. Moreover, it has been estimated based on molecular dating that the first \"Synechococcus\" lineage has appeared 3 billion years ago in thermal springs with subsequent radiation to marine and freshwater environments.\nEcology and distribution.\n\"Synechococcus\" has been observed to occur at concentrations ranging between a few cells to 106 cells per ml in virtually all regions of oceanic &lt;a href=\"euphotic%20zone\"&gt;euphotic zone&lt;/a&gt; except in samples from the &lt;a href=\"McMurdo%20Sound\"&gt;McMurdo Sound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Ice%20Shelf\"&gt;Ross Ice Shelf&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. Cells are generally much more abundant in nutrient-rich environments than in the oligotrophic ocean and prefer the upper, well-lit portion of the euphotic zone. \"Synechococcus\" has also been observed to occur at high abundances in environments with low salinities and/or low temperatures. It is usually far outnumbered by \"&lt;a href=\"Prochlorococcus\"&gt;Prochlorococcus&lt;/a&gt;\" in all environments where they co-occur. Exceptions to this rule are areas of permanently enriched nutrients such as &lt;a href=\"upwelling\"&gt;upwelling&lt;/a&gt; areas and &lt;a href=\"coastal%20watershed\"&gt;coastal watershed&lt;/a&gt;s. In the nutrient-depleted areas of the oceans, such as the central gyres, \"Synechococcus\" is apparently always present, although only at low concentrations, ranging from a few to 4\u00d710\u00b3 cells per ml. Vertically \"Synechococcus\" is usually relatively equitably distributed throughout the &lt;a href=\"mixed%20layer\"&gt;mixed layer&lt;/a&gt; and exhibits an affinity for the higher-light areas. Below the mixed layer, cell concentrations rapidly decline. Vertical profiles are strongly influenced by hydrologic conditions and can be very variable both seasonally and spatially. Overall, \"Synechococcus\" abundance often parallels that of \"Prochlorococcus\" in the &lt;a href=\"water%20column\"&gt;water column&lt;/a&gt;. In the Pacific &lt;a href=\"high-nutrient%2C%20low-chlorophyll\"&gt;high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt; zone and in temperate open seas where stratification was recently established both profiles parallel each other and exhibit abundance maxima just about the subsurface chlorophyll maximum.\nThe factors controlling the abundance of \"Synechococcus\" still remain poorly understood, especially considering that even in the most nutrient-depleted regions of the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20gyre\"&gt;central gyres&lt;/a&gt;, where cell abundances are often very low, population growth rates are often high and not drastically limited. Factors such as grazing, viral mortality, genetic variability, light adaptation, and temperature, as well as nutrients are certainly involved, but remain to be investigated on a rigorous and global scale. Despite the uncertainties, a relationship probably exists between ambient nitrogen concentrations and \"Synechococcus\" abundance, with an inverse relationship to \"Prochlorococcus\" in the upper &lt;a href=\"euphotic%20zone\"&gt;euphotic zone&lt;/a&gt;, where light is not limiting. One environment where \"Synechococcus\" thrives particularly well is coastal plumes of major rivers. Such &lt;a href=\"Plume%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29\"&gt;plumes&lt;/a&gt; are coastally enriched with nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate, which drives large &lt;a href=\"phytoplankton%20bloom\"&gt;phytoplankton bloom&lt;/a&gt;s. High productivity in coastal river &lt;a href=\"Plume%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29\"&gt;plumes&lt;/a&gt; is often associated with large populations of \"Synechococcus\" and elevated form IA (cyanobacterial) \"rbcL\" mRNA.\n\"Prochlorococcus\" is thought to be at least 100 times more abundant than \"Synechococcus\" in warm oligotrophic waters. Assuming average cellular carbon concentrations, it has thus been estimated that \"Prochlorococcus\" accounts for at least 22 times more carbon in these waters, thus may be of much greater significance to the global &lt;a href=\"carbon%20cycle\"&gt;carbon cycle&lt;/a&gt; than \"Synechococcus\"."
