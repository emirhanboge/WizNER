    "text": "The Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team represents &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20University\"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt; (variously Florida State or FSU) in the intercollegiate sport of &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. The Seminoles compete in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) &lt;a href=\"Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ACC).\nThough they have historically played under the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; program, the Seminoles have had successes on the hardwood and they have achieved success in recent years. Florida State has made eighteen &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; appearances: advancing to the \"Round of 32\" on twelve occasions, the \"Sweet Sixteen\" on seven occasions, the \"Elite Eight\" on three occasions, and the \"Final Four\" once, moving on to the championship game and finishing as runner-up. On March 14, 2020, Florida State was named the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Champions by the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;Florida State Legislature&lt;/a&gt; after the NCAA Tournament was canceled due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Florida State has also made ten appearances in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Invitation%20Tournament\"&gt;National Invitation Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 75 season history of the Seminole basketball program, the Seminoles have won the regular season conference title five times and the conference tournament title four times, including two ACC championships.\nFlorida State has had 23 All-Americans, 26 players inducted into the Hall of Fame, and 36 players that went on to play in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Sagarin\"&gt;Jeff Sagarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; listed the program 74th in the college basketball all-time rankings in the 'ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia'.\nThe Seminoles play their home games in the &lt;a href=\"Donald%20L.%20Tucker%20Center\"&gt;Donald L. Tucker Center&lt;/a&gt; on the university's &lt;a href=\"Tallahassee%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tallahassee, Florida&lt;/a&gt; campus. The current head men's basketball coach is &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Hamilton\"&gt;Leonard Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, in his twentieth year.\nOverview.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles\"&gt;Florida State Seminoles&lt;/a&gt; men's team annually plays an eighteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule against few annual opponents except for &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Their conference schedule consists of a home-and-home game against two permanent rivals (&lt;a href=\"Miami%20Hurricanes%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt;), alternating home-and-home games against the other fourteen ACC teams.\nHistory.\nFlorida State University has officially fielded a basketball team since 1947, and the Seminoles are currently in their 76th season of play.\nDon Loucks era (1947\u20131948).\nHugh Donald Loucks served as the first basketball coach for the Florida State Seminoles. He coached at the school for one year and compiled an overall record of 5\u201313, becoming one of only two coaches to leave the program with a losing record of 11 games.\nJ.K. Kennedy era (1949\u20131966).\nAfter the departure of Loucks, &lt;a href=\"J.K.%20Kennedy\"&gt;J.K. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; became the coach. He was the first coach to find success at Florida State, holding the position for 18 years and compiling a record of 234\u2013208.\nHugh Durham era (1966\u20131978).\n&lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Durham\"&gt;Hugh Durham&lt;/a&gt; played at Florida State in the 1950s, scoring 1,381 points in three years. His average of 21.9 points per game in 1958\u201359 is the seventh best tally in Florida State history. Durham's career average of 18.9 points per game is still the ninth best in school history. After his playing career had ended, he began his coaching career as an assistant coach in 1959. Seven years later, Durham would be named head coach in 1966. One of the top players during this time was future NBA Hall-of-Famer &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Cowens\"&gt;Dave Cowens&lt;/a&gt;. Durham led the Seminoles from 1966 to 1978. In 1972, Durham led Florida State to a runner-up finish in the NCAA Tournament. A hard-fought 81\u201376 loss to the top-ranked UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Championship game prevented Durham's Florida State team from winning the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Another key player for the Seminoles was &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Davis%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Harry Davis&lt;/a&gt;, who helped the program sustain stability.\nDurham's overall record at Florida State was a 230\u201395 record with three NCAA tournament bids. He still owns the highest winning percentage of any Florida State coach at .708. Durham is the only coach in NCAA history to be the all-time winningest coach (percentage or wins) at three different Division I schools.\nJoe Williams era (1978\u20131986).\nAfter the departure of Hugh Durham, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Williams%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Joe Williams&lt;/a&gt; took over the Seminole basketball program. One of the standout players during this period was &lt;a href=\"George%20McCloud\"&gt;George McCloud&lt;/a&gt;. McCloud helped the Seminoles rebuild after the departure of Durham by becoming one of the most prolific scorers in FSU history. During his senior season, McCloud had the second-highest scoring average and the sixth-highest in Florida State history. Joe Williams would coach his final season in 1986.\nPat Kennedy era (1986\u20131997).\nThe &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;1992\u20131993 season&lt;/a&gt; would see the emergence of one of the Seminoles' best players in its history, Bob Sura\n. Not much was expected of the Seminoles in 1992 as they entered into their first season in the ACC, yet they finished second in the conference to national champion &lt;a href=\"Duke\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt;. The team repeated the second-place finish in 1993, establishing itself as a legitimate national power. In the 1993 NCAA Tournament they fell to &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; in the Elite Eight round. In Kennedy's final season (1996\u20131997) he led the team to the NIT Final, losing to the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Wolverines\"&gt;Michigan Wolverines&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteve Robinson era (1997\u20132002).\n&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Robinson%20%28basketball%20coach%29\"&gt;Steve Robinson&lt;/a&gt; took over the program for the 1997\u20131998 season and led the Seminoles to the NCAA Tournament his first year. However, the team suffered losing records the next four seasons and Robinson left the program after the 2001\u20132002 campaign. Robinson is now an assistant coach with the &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels\"&gt;North Carolina Tar Heels&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeonard Hamilton era (2002\u2013present).\n&lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Hamilton\"&gt;Leonard Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; became Florida State's seventh head basketball coach on March 19, 2002. In two years, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Pickett\"&gt;Tim Pickett&lt;/a&gt; scored 1,039 points, earning him First-Team All-ACC and All-American Honorable Mention honors. Hamilton was named ACC Coach of the Year in 2009, 2012, and 2020. Hamilton is also the first Seminole coach to win an ACC Championship, capturing the league tournament title in 2012 and the regular season title in 2020. He has led the Seminoles to eight NCAA tournament appearances. During his tenure, Florida State has been the third-most successful team in the conference. Hamilton is the winningest coach in the program's history, the fifth winningest coach in conference history, and has sent nineteen players to the &lt;a href=\"NBA%20Draft\"&gt;NBA Draft&lt;/a&gt;, including nine first round picks.\nHome court.\nDonald L. Tucker Center.\nThe Seminoles play all of their home games at the &lt;a href=\"Donald%20L.%20Tucker%20Center\"&gt;Donald L. Tucker Center&lt;/a&gt;. It is a multi-purpose facility which has hosted over 25 years worth of Seminole games. Since the 2016\u20132017 season, the Seminoles have gone undefeated twice at home and had twenty-five consecutive conference victories on their home court, the second longest streak in conference history.\nChampionships.\nNational Championship appearance.\nFlorida State has appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament's National Championship game once, in 1972. The Seminoles, coached by &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Durham\"&gt;Hugh Durham&lt;/a&gt;, lost to &lt;a href=\"John%20Wooden\"&gt;John Wooden&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;UCLA Bruins&lt;/a&gt;, 81\u201376, at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Sports%20Arena\"&gt;Memorial Sports Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. The Seminoles defeated powerhouse Kentucky in the Mideast Region Final and North Carolina in the Final Four. \nRegional Championship.\nFlorida State defeated &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, 73\u201354, to win their only regional championship.\nNIT Championship appearance.\nFlorida State has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament's National Championship game once, in 1997.
