    "text": "Nieblum (&lt;a href=\"Fering\"&gt;Fering&lt;/a&gt;: \"Njiblem\", Danish: \"Niblum\") is a municipality on the island of &lt;a href=\"F%C3%B6hr\"&gt;F\u00f6hr&lt;/a&gt;, in the district of &lt;a href=\"Nordfriesland\"&gt;Nordfriesland&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nNieblum is located on the southern shore of F\u00f6hr, approximately halfways between the eastern and western edges of the island. Next to the village of Nieblum proper, the municipality includes the once independent hamlet of Goting which is situated just west of Nieblum. In Goting there is a cliffside of several meters height.\nHistory.\nMany of the old Frisian houses used to belong to sea captains who had made a fortune as &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20whaling\"&gt;whalers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; ships. It was a hard and dangerous work which claimed a lot of lives. The tombstones in the graveyard of St. John's church, the so-called \"Frisian Cathedral\", in the village testify this. The church was built in the 13th century and it is the largest of the three churches on F\u00f6hr.\nPolitics.\nSince the communal elections of 2008, the \"Nieblumer W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft\" holds six of nine seats in the municipality council, the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt; holds three.\nCulture and sights.\nNieblum's main attraction is the defiant church of St. John with its &lt;a href=\"Historical%20preservation\"&gt;historically preserved&lt;/a&gt; graveyard. Moreover the view of Nieblum with its &lt;a href=\"Thatching\"&gt;thatched&lt;/a&gt; houses and many trees is pleasant to the eye.\nSince the 1950s, the Ernst Schlee school of &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;-Klein-Flottbek had been operating a summer boarding school in Nieblum. After conversion into a public trading school, the institution was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Othmarschen\"&gt;Othmarschen&lt;/a&gt; high school."
