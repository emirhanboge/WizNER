    "text": "A Queen's Counsel (&lt;a href=\"Post-nominal%20letters\"&gt;post-nominal&lt;/a&gt; QC), or King's Counsel (post-nominal KC) during the reign of a &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;, is an eminent &lt;a href=\"lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; (usually a &lt;a href=\"barrister\"&gt;barrister&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"advocate\"&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt;) who is appointed by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20British%20monarchs\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt; to be one of \"Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law.\" The term is recognized as an &lt;a href=\"honorific\"&gt;honorific&lt;/a&gt;. Appointments are made from within the legal profession based on merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28law%29\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see &lt;a href=\"court%20dress\"&gt;court dress&lt;/a&gt;), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as \"taking silk\", and hence QCs are often colloquially called \"silks\".\nThe rank emerged in the sixteenth century but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. An appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949. In 1951, 16 people were appointed, all of them men.\n1951.\n3 April 1951.\nSource: \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39190/page/1757/data.pdf\"&gt;The London Gazette&lt;/a&gt;\", 3 April 1951 (no. 39190), p.\u00a01757."
