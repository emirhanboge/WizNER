    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"statistical%20hypothesis%20testing\"&gt;statistical hypothesis testing&lt;/a&gt;, a uniformly most powerful (UMP) test is a &lt;a href=\"statistical%20hypothesis%20testing\"&gt;hypothesis test&lt;/a&gt; which has the greatest &lt;a href=\"Statistical%20power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; formula_1 among all possible tests of a given &lt;a href=\"Type%20I%20and%20type%20II%20errors\"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt; \"\u03b1\". For example, according to the &lt;a href=\"Neyman%E2%80%93Pearson%20lemma\"&gt;Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"likelihood-ratio%20test\"&gt;likelihood-ratio&lt;/a&gt; test is UMP for testing simple (point) hypotheses.\nSetting.\nLet formula_2 denote a random vector (corresponding to the measurements), taken from a &lt;a href=\"parametrized%20family\"&gt;parametrized family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"probability%20density%20function\"&gt;probability density function&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"probability%20mass%20function\"&gt;probability mass function&lt;/a&gt;s formula_3, which depends on the unknown deterministic parameter formula_4. The parameter space formula_5 is partitioned into two disjoint sets formula_6 and formula_7. Let formula_8 denote the hypothesis that formula_9, and let formula_10 denote the hypothesis that formula_11.\nThe binary test of hypotheses is performed using a test function formula_12 with a reject region formula_13 (a subset of measurement space).\nmeaning that formula_10 is in force if the measurement formula_16 and that formula_8 is in force if the measurement formula_18.\nNote that formula_19 is a disjoint covering of the measurement space.\nFormal definition.\nA test function formula_12 is UMP of size formula_21 if for any other test function formula_22 satisfying\nwe have\nThe Karlin\u2013Rubin theorem.\nThe Karlin\u2013Rubin theorem can be regarded as an extension of the Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma for composite hypotheses. Consider a scalar measurement having a probability density function parameterized by a scalar parameter \"\u03b8\", and define the likelihood ratio formula_25.\nIf formula_26 is monotone non-decreasing, in formula_27, for any pair formula_28 (meaning that the greater formula_27 is, the more likely formula_10 is), then the threshold test:\nis the UMP test of size \"\u03b1\" for testing formula_34\nNote that exactly the same test is also UMP for testing formula_35\nImportant case: exponential family.\nAlthough the Karlin-Rubin theorem may seem weak because of its restriction to scalar parameter and scalar measurement, it turns out that there exist a host of problems for which the theorem holds. In particular, the one-dimensional &lt;a href=\"exponential%20family\"&gt;exponential family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"probability%20density%20function\"&gt;probability density function&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"probability%20mass%20function\"&gt;probability mass function&lt;/a&gt;s with\nhas a monotone non-decreasing likelihood ratio in the &lt;a href=\"Sufficiency%20%28statistics%29\"&gt;sufficient statistic&lt;/a&gt; formula_37, provided that formula_38 is non-decreasing.\nExample.\nLet formula_39 denote i.i.d. normally distributed formula_40-dimensional random vectors with mean formula_41 and covariance matrix formula_13. We then have\nwhich is exactly in the form of the exponential family shown in the previous section, with the sufficient statistic being\nThus, we conclude that the test\nis the UMP test of size formula_21 for testing formula_47 vs. formula_48\nFurther discussion.\nFinally, we note that in general, UMP tests do not exist for vector parameters or for two-sided tests (a test in which one hypothesis lies on both sides of the alternative). The reason is that in these situations, the most powerful test of a given size for one possible value of the parameter (e.g. for formula_49 where formula_50) is different from the most powerful test of the same size for a different value of the parameter (e.g. for formula_51 where formula_52). As a result, no test is uniformly most powerful in these situations."
