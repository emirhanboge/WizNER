Manuel quickly became renowned as a photographer of people from the worlds of &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a photographer of art and &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Soon his portraits were used by &lt;a href=\"news\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; agencies, and in 1910 Manuel's studio began providing a commercial service to news agencies for photographs known as \"l\u2019Agence universelle de reportage Henri Manuel\".\nThe studio became the largest photographic studio in Paris and a leading centre where young aspiring photographers such as &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20Bonney\"&gt;Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bonney&lt;/a&gt; might go to work. In 1925, the brothers moved their business to 27 rue du &lt;a href=\"Faubourg%20Montmartre\"&gt;Faubourg Montmartre&lt;/a&gt;, where they expanded their business into fashion photography for the likes of &lt;a href=\"Chanel\"&gt;Chanel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Patou\"&gt;Patou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Poiret\"&gt;Poiret&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeanne%20Lanvin\"&gt;Lanvin&lt;/a&gt;. By 1941 the studio had produced over a million images, spread between fashion photographs, news agency photographs, personal portraits and other images.\nThe studio was shut down during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the &lt;a href=\"photographic%20plate\"&gt;photographic plate&lt;/a&gt;s were destroyed. Some 500 survived, and ultimately passed into possession of the &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9diath%C3%A8que%20de%20l%E2%80%99architecture%20et%20du%20patrimoine\"&gt;M\u00e9diath\u00e8que de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine&lt;/a&gt;."
