    "text": "Andr\u00e9 Aliker (Roches-Carr\u00e9es, &lt;a href=\"Lamentin\"&gt;Lamentin&lt;/a&gt;, 10 February 1894 - 10, 11 or 12 January 1934) was a militant Martiniquais communist journalist who was abducted and murdered.\nAliker was editor of \"Justice\", the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, publishing for example in 1933 accusations that Eug\u00e8ne Aub\u00e9ry, the wealthy &lt;a href=\"b%C3%A9k%C3%A9\"&gt;b\u00e9k\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; owner of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de Lareinty, had bribed the judges of the Court of Appeal to dismiss charges of tax fraud against his wife in 1929. On 1 January 1934, Aliker was abducted for the first time, beaten and thrown into the sea, but survived. He wrote to his brother &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Aliker\"&gt;Pierre Aliker&lt;/a&gt; (doctor and later co-founder of the Parti progressiste martiniquais) that Eug\u00e8ne Aub\u00e9ry had put a price on his head. Some days later he was again abducted by persons unknown and his body was washed up on the beach with his arms tied behind him on 12 January."
