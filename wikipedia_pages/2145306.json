He served in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Royal%20Navy\"&gt;French Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Revolt%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; against the revolutionary regime. His nephew &lt;a href=\"Athanase-Charles-Marie%20Charette%20de%20la%20Contrie\"&gt;Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie&lt;/a&gt; was a noted military leader and grandson of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20X%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles X&lt;/a&gt; the last king of France.\nLife.\nEarly activities.\nA &lt;a href=\"French%20nobility\"&gt;nobleman&lt;/a&gt; born in &lt;a href=\"Couff%C3%A9\"&gt;Couff\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arrondissement%20of%20Ancenis\"&gt;arrondissement of Ancenis&lt;/a&gt;, Charette served in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Toussaint-Guillaume%20Picquet%20de%20la%20Motte\"&gt;Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte&lt;/a&gt;, notably during the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, and became \"&lt;a href=\"Lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant de vaisseau&lt;/a&gt;\". He notably served on the &lt;a href=\"74-gun\"&gt;74-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Hercule%20%281778%29\"&gt;\"Hercule\"&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Honor%C3%A9%20Louis%20de%20Puget-Bras\"&gt;Puget-Bras&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the outbreak of the French Revolution, he quit the Navy in 1789 and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89migr%C3%A9\"&gt;emigrated&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Koblenz\"&gt;Koblenz&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt;) in 1792 (a common move for &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bourbon\"&gt;royalist&lt;/a&gt; aristocrats). He soon returned to France to live at his property in &lt;a href=\"La%20Garnache\"&gt;La Garnache&lt;/a&gt;, and became one of the royalist volunteers who assisted in defending &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Antoinette\"&gt;Marie Antoinette&lt;/a&gt; from physical harm during the mob attack on &lt;a href=\"Tuileries%20Palace\"&gt;Tuileries Palace&lt;/a&gt; (the \"&lt;a href=\"10%20August%20%28French%20Revolution%29\"&gt;Journ\u00e9e du 10 ao\u00fbt&lt;/a&gt;\"); arrested in &lt;a href=\"Angers\"&gt;Angers&lt;/a&gt;, he was released through the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dumouriez\"&gt;Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez&lt;/a&gt;.\nVend\u00e9e War.\nIn 1793, the &lt;a href=\"Revolt%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"French%20First%20Republic\"&gt;French First Republic&lt;/a&gt; broke out, and the peasant fighters asked Charette to be their leader. He joined &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Cathelineau\"&gt;Jacques Cathelineau&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Saumur%20%281793%29\"&gt;taking of Saumur&lt;/a&gt; in June 1793 and fought in most of the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20and%20Royal%20Army\"&gt;Catholic and Royal Army&lt;/a&gt;. On 19 September 1793, he participated in the victorious &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tiffauges\"&gt;Battle of Tiffauges&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards he and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Marie%20de%20Lescure\"&gt;Louis Marie de Lescure&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Saint-Fulgent\"&gt;marched on Saint-Fulgent&lt;/a&gt; to pursue &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Kl%C3%A9ber\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber&lt;/a&gt;, who had escaped. Charette won another victory over the Republicans at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20Noirmoutier\"&gt;First Battle of Noirmoutier&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the captured soldiers took part in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Massacre%20of%20Machecoul\"&gt;Machecoul Massacres&lt;/a&gt; and a quarter of them were executed for retribution by Charette's troops, against his orders. After the parting of the Vendean leaders in September 1793, he and his men retreated. He became the leader of the Lower Vend\u00e9e, and successfully used &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt; against the Republican troops, capturing a Republican camp in &lt;a href=\"Saint-Christophe-du-Ligneron\"&gt;Saint-Christophe-du-Ligneron&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Challans\"&gt;Challans&lt;/a&gt;, but ran out of supplies and was decisively attacked by the troops of &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Haxo\"&gt;Nicolas Haxo&lt;/a&gt;. Trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Bouin\"&gt;Isle of Bouin&lt;/a&gt;, Charette, with the fellow leader was informed of an escape route by a local to the isle. Leaving behind all guns, ammunition, horses, refugees and the wounded, Charette, Cou\u00ebtus and their men swam through the marshes to &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teauneuf%2C%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teauneuf&lt;/a&gt;. By a chance stroke of luck, Charette met up with the army of , and both he and Charette retaliated by circling Haxo, gaining back supplies and distracting the Republican army from the refugees. Haxo later attacked the &lt;a href=\"Noirmoutier-en-l%27%C3%8Ele\"&gt;Isle of Noirmoutier&lt;/a&gt;, with , which had been taken by Charette the month before, and after promising life to the inhabitants if they surrendered, against Haxo's command Turreau killed most men, women and children on the isle at the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Noirmoutier-en-l%27%C3%8Ele\"&gt;local church (La chapelle de la Piti\u00e9)&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20d%27Elb%C3%A9e\"&gt;D'Elb\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; who had taken refuge there after sustaining 14 wounds at the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Cholet\"&gt;Second Battle of Cholet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Charette's army returned and collected reinforcements; Revolutionary brutality and the '&lt;a href=\"infernal%20columns\"&gt;infernal columns&lt;/a&gt;' sent by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Vend\u00e9e forced many peasants to join Charette's army merely for safety. Charette won &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Saint-Fulgent\"&gt;a victory at Saint-Fulgent&lt;/a&gt;, only to be chased into hiding in the forest of Grala. He emerged from it to attack &lt;a href=\"Les%20Brouzils\"&gt;Les Brouzils&lt;/a&gt;; he was wounded in the arm but kept on until the end of the fight. After obtaining food for his starving army, Charette was brought to &lt;a href=\"La%20Mori%C3%A8re\"&gt;La Mori\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, a convent near &lt;a href=\"Machecoul\"&gt;Machecoul&lt;/a&gt;, to recover from his wound; he was only able to rest there for a few days when his location was betrayed and the Republicans surrounded the convent. Warned, he was able to escape, but the nuns and a large number of the refugees who had come with Charette's army and had hidden in the church were massacred.\nDefeat.\nOn 17 February 1795, after being introduced to it by his sister, Charette signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20La%20Jaunaye\"&gt;Treaty of La Jaunaye&lt;/a&gt; with the emissaries of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Convention\"&gt;National Convention&lt;/a&gt;, which included &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/a&gt; guarantees and excluded the conscription of local peasants from the \"&lt;a href=\"lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse\"&gt;lev\u00e9e en masse&lt;/a&gt;\". The republicans soon reneged on the terms of the treaty, and their &lt;a href=\"parole\"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt;, repudiating the guarantees of religious freedom; and they began conscripting peasants once again. They also murdered thousands of royalist prisoners including the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Diocese%20of%20Dol\"&gt;Bishop of Dol&lt;/a&gt;, . Charette and his men returned to the fight again in July and moved to help &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20France%20%281795%29\"&gt;the planned invasion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Quiberon\"&gt;Quiberon&lt;/a&gt; by French royalist \u00e9migr\u00e9s with assistance from the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Charles%20X%20of%20France\"&gt;Count of Artois&lt;/a&gt;, the Bourbon successor to the throne of France, made him &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General\"&gt;Lieutenant General&lt;/a&gt; and gave orders to prepare for a royal return which, however, did not eventuate. Charette remained loyal to the old dynasty and the Catholic religion, as did his men and most of the Vendean and Breton peasantry. He, and all the loyal royalists, later refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orl%C3%A9anist\"&gt;Orl\u00e9anist&lt;/a&gt;s. After the failure of the Quiberon expedition, Charette and his men were pursued by General &lt;a href=\"Lazare%20Hoche\"&gt;Lazare Hoche&lt;/a&gt;. Charette was wounded but escaped. However, due to lack of munitions he was eventually captured outside and taken to &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; for a trial. He was sentenced to death by a republican court and then taken to the town square in procession for a public execution by &lt;a href=\"firing%20squad\"&gt;firing squad&lt;/a&gt;. A plaque has been erected and still stands upon the place where he was shot. Today, memorial ceremonies continue to take place there.\nAccording to a contemporary writing in \"&lt;a href=\"Walker%27s%20Hibernian%20Magazine\"&gt;Walker's Hibernian Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\", it was Charette who said, by way of extenuating the number of deaths for which he was responsible, \"Omelets are not made without breaking eggs.\"\nCharette was described by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; as a great character and military leader who \"betrays genius\".\nDepictions in films and popular culture.\nCharette is a character in the episode \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Frogs%20and%20the%20Lobsters\"&gt;The Frogs and the Lobsters&lt;/a&gt;\" of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hornblower%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Hornblower&lt;/a&gt;\" film/television series, played by &lt;a href=\"John%20Shrapnel\"&gt;John Shrapnel&lt;/a&gt;. Charette is a royalist general in exile who, with the support of the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, attempts and fails to rally the surviving royalists and raise an army in France to restore the king to power. Unlike his real-life counterpart here he is slain in battle defending a captured fortification. He is also fluent in English in the television adaptation.\nCharette has been since 2018 the lead character and his life story is depicted in the production of \"Le Dernier Panache\" (\"The Last Plume\"), at the French theme park, &lt;a href=\"Puy%20du%20Fou\"&gt;Puy du Fou&lt;/a&gt;."
