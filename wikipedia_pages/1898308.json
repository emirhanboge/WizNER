A bendahara was appointed by a &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt; and was a hereditary post. The bendahara and the sultan shared the same lineage.\nTasks of the Bendahara.\nThe closest post which is comparable to the post of the &lt;a href=\"vizier\"&gt;vizier&lt;/a&gt; as the Malay kingdoms are Islamic kingdoms. As the bendahara is the head of the nobility, the status confers certain responsibility. The bendahara is the backbone of the Malay Sultanate. For the ancient kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt;, there were many tasks and responsibilities but the primary ones were:\nLegitimacy of the Sultan lies with the bendahara. The bendahara always consulted the other nobles before arriving at a decision. The bendahara and nobles do this for the well-being of the subjects and is essential if there are problems in the state. These tasks are more extensive than any vizier or the modern prime minister.\nThe involvement of the British and the Dutch in the administration of the Malay States and the subsequent independence of Malaysia and Indonesia has reduced the Bendahara to a symbolic title only.\nHistory.\nThough it is unclear when the title was first used, the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Sultanate of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; had several influential bendaharas. The most famous is &lt;a href=\"Tun%20Perak\"&gt;Tun Perak&lt;/a&gt;. Under Tun Perak's service which spanned several sultans, Malacca reached its height in the late 15th century. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Malay%20Annals\"&gt;Malay Annals&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Hikayat%20Hang%20Tuah\"&gt;Hikayat Hang Tuah&lt;/a&gt;\", the bendahara secretly saved the life of &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Tuah\"&gt;Hang Tuah&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"laksamana\"&gt;laksamana&lt;/a&gt; the sultan had ordered killed.\nIn 1612, Bendahara &lt;a href=\"Tun%20Sri%20Lanang\"&gt;Tun Sri Lanang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultanate of Johor&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned by Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah of Johor to compile Malay history and record it into a book. The book was known as Sulalatus Salatin and later known as &lt;a href=\"Sejarah%20Melayu\"&gt;Sejarah Melayu&lt;/a&gt;, an important literary piece in &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay language&lt;/a&gt; history. In 1699, Bendahara Abdul Jalil became Sultan Abdul Jalil IV of Johor after the previous sultan, &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20Shah%20II\"&gt;Mahmud Shah II&lt;/a&gt; was murdered, leaving no heir behind. After the rule of Sultan Abdul Jalil IV, the bendahara was awarded &lt;a href=\"Pahang\"&gt;Pahang&lt;/a&gt; as his personal fief. Bendahara Tun Abbas and his descendants ruled Pahang continuously until Tun Mutahir, who was deposed in a &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in 1863.\nThe current &lt;a href=\"Terengganu\"&gt;Terengganu&lt;/a&gt; sultanate was founded by Sultan Zainal Abidin I of Terengganu in 1708. He was the son of &lt;a href=\"Tun%20Habib%20Abdul%20Majid\"&gt;Tun Habib Abdul Majid&lt;/a&gt;, a 17th-century \"bendahara\" of Johor.\nBendaharas of Malacca and Johor.\nAfter the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese, the Malacca Sultanate was succeeded by the Johore Sultanate.\nThe following Bendaharas were sidelined by the palace following the rise of Laksamana Paduka Tuan:\nAfter the succession of Sultan Abdul Jalil IV in Johor, the Bendahara were granted Pahang as a personal fief. Thereafter the Bendahara of Johor were known as the Bendahara in Pahang. They are also known as \"Raja Bendahara\" for their status as the rulers of Melaka as a &lt;a href=\"vassal\"&gt;vassal&lt;/a&gt; state of the Johore Sultanate.\nModern-day usage.\nIn modern times of &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, it is typical to render the position as &lt;a href=\"prime%20minister\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;. Though a bendahara's duties are similar to that of a prime minister's, the two terms are not interchangeable. One clear difference is the amount of power held by the two positions. In ancient times, the bendahara was typically the highest-ranking official after the sultan but the sultan retained ultimate authority. The sultan was not answerable to the bendahara, or to anyone else for that matter. The sultan was not just a &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Yang%20di-Pertuan%20Agong\"&gt;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&lt;/a&gt; in contemporary &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; holds effective political power.\nCurrent titles used:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Brunei\"&gt;Brunei&lt;/a&gt;, the term of Bendahara is still used where it is known as \"Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara Brunei\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"treasurer\"&gt;treasurer&lt;/a&gt; is commonly referred as Bendahara. In Malaysia the equivalent/similar term for the treasurer of a small organisation/club is \"bendahari\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, the term Bendahara was recorded by &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Pigafetta\"&gt;Antonio Pigafetta&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Magellan\"&gt;Ferdinand Magellan&lt;/a&gt; expedition to refer to the Prime Minister of the &lt;a href=\"Rajahnate%20of%20Cebu\"&gt;Rajahnate of Cebu&lt;/a&gt; who was the brother of Rajah Humabon, king of that Polity."
