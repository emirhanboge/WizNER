    "text": "SMS \"Delphin\" was a of the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Navy\"&gt;Prussian Navy&lt;/a&gt; (later the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt;) that was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 1860. A small vessel, armed with only three light guns, \"Delphin\" served during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;Second Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt; of 1864 and the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Austro-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; of 1866, part of the conflicts that &lt;a href=\"unification%20of%20Germany\"&gt;unified Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was present at, but was only lightly engaged in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Jasmund%20%281864%29\"&gt;Battle of Jasmund&lt;/a&gt; during the Second Schleswig War. The ship spent much of the rest of her career in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, going on three lengthy deployments there in 1865\u20131866, 1867\u20131870, and 1871\u20131873. During the last tour, she took part in operations off the coast of Spain with an Anglo-German squadron during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;Third Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;, where she helped to suppress forces rebelling against the Spanish government. For the rest of the 1870s, she served as a &lt;a href=\"survey%20vessel\"&gt;survey vessel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;s before being decommissioned in August 1881, stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; the following month, and subsequently &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Delphin\" was long, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"full%20load\"&gt;full load&lt;/a&gt;. The ship's crew consisted of 4\u00a0officers and 67\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a single &lt;a href=\"marine%20steam%20engine\"&gt;marine steam engine&lt;/a&gt; that drove one 3-bladed &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;, with steam provided by two coal-fired trunk &lt;a href=\"boiler\"&gt;boiler&lt;/a&gt;s, which gave her a top speed of at . As built, she was equipped with a three-&lt;a href=\"Mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;masted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; rig. The ship was armed with a &lt;a href=\"battery%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt; of one rifled 24-pounder &lt;a href=\"muzzleloader\"&gt;muzzle-loading&lt;/a&gt; gun and two rifled 12-pounder muzzle-loading guns.\nService history.\nConstruction through 1866.\nThe &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; for \"Delphin\" was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Danzig\"&gt;\"K\u00f6nigliche Werft\"&lt;/a&gt; (Royal Dockyard) in &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt; on 8 September 1859. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year later, on 15 September 1860. After completing &lt;a href=\"fitting-out\"&gt;fitting-out&lt;/a&gt;, she was transferred to the naval base at &lt;a href=\"Stralsund\"&gt;Stralsund&lt;/a&gt; in September 1861, and while en route conducted speed trials that demonstrated \"Delphin\" was capable of a speed higher than her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s. Her higher speed led to several overseas deployments later in her career, though like her sisters, she was initially &lt;a href=\"reserve%20fleet\"&gt;laid up&lt;/a&gt; in reserve after completion. In late 1863, tensions began to rise between Prussia and Austria of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt; and Denmark over the latter's &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein%23The%20November%20Constitution\"&gt;November Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which integrated the duchies of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Holstein\"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Lauenburg\"&gt;Lauenburg&lt;/a&gt; with Denmark, a violation of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Protocol%20%281852%29\"&gt;London Protocol&lt;/a&gt; that had ended the &lt;a href=\"First%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;First Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 March 1864, after the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;Second Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;, \"Delphin\" was reactivated and stationed in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A4nholm\"&gt;D\u00e4nholm&lt;/a&gt; off Stralsund. There, she was assigned to the II Flotilla Division. On 14 April, after a minor action off the island of &lt;a href=\"Hiddensee\"&gt;Hiddensee&lt;/a&gt;, in which \"Delphin\" did not take part, the Prussian gunboat flotilla was reduced to a reserve formation and took no further active part in the war. After the war in 1865, \"Delphin\" was tasked with surveying &lt;a href=\"Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay\"&gt;Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; in Holstein, which was now under the administration of the German Confederation. From 1 to 3 March, \"Delphin\" served as an &lt;a href=\"ice%20breaker\"&gt;ice breaker&lt;/a&gt; in Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay.\nIn February, the naval high command had decided to send \"Delphin\" to &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as a station ship to protect German interests in the region. Accordingly, \"Delphin\" underwent a major overhaul to prepare her for the overseas deployment. During the overhaul, her schooner rig was reduced slightly to a &lt;a href=\"barquentine\"&gt;barquentine&lt;/a&gt; rig, and the boat's 24-pounder was replaced with a rifled 68-pounder gun. \"Delphin\" conducted a training cruise with the corvette to &lt;a href=\"Sonderburg\"&gt;Sonderburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Travem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Travem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wismar\"&gt;Wismar&lt;/a&gt; from 20 to 23 July. On 3 August, \"Delphin\" towed the &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; back to port after the latter had had her rigging damaged in a storm. Three days later, \"Delphin\" left Prussia for the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; in company with \"Nymphe\", stopping initially in &lt;a href=\"Piraeus\"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt; on 22 September. The vessels' deployment was short-lived, however, as war with Austria threatened in April 1866, and both ships were recalled to Prussia. They arrived on 3 July, the day the Prussian army decisively defeated Austria at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz\"&gt;Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz&lt;/a&gt;. For the remainder of the war, \"Delphin\" was assigned to the North Sea Flotilla, which was commanded by then-\"&lt;a href=\"Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Korvettenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"KK\"\u2014Corvette Captain) &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%20von%20Werner\"&gt;Reinhold von Werner&lt;/a&gt; from his &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;, the ironclad &lt;a href=\"turret%20ship\"&gt;turret ship&lt;/a&gt; . For the duration of the conflict, the flotilla operated out of &lt;a href=\"Geestem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Geestem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt;. Without a naval threat from Austria, the Prussian navy therefore concentrated its effort against the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Kingdom of Hanover&lt;/a&gt;. On 22 August, \"Delphin\" was decommissioned in Danzig.\n1867\u20131881.\nIn 1867, the high command decided to send \"Delphin\" back to the Mediterranean. She was sent to the \"K\u00f6nigliche Werft\" in Danzig for a reconstruction that would make the vessel more suitable for an extended overseas assignment. This included replacing old or damaged hull timbers, installing a new deck, and rebuilding the crew spaces to make them more habitable. On 1 May 1868, \"Delphin\" was finally &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;recommissioned&lt;/a&gt; for her assignment, but conflicts in the &lt;a href=\"Reichstag%20%28North%20German%20Confederation%29\"&gt;\"Reichstag\"&lt;/a&gt; (Diet of the Realm) over budgets forced the navy to cancel \"Delphin\"s deployment to save money. Accordingly, she was placed out of service temporarily. In August, \"Delphin\" was recommissioned and on the 21st, began the voyage to the Mediterranean. While en route, damage to her engine forced her to stop in &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; for repairs. She finally reached Constantinople on 17 October, and on 24 October she steamed to the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sulina\"&gt;Sulina&lt;/a&gt;. She steamed about upstream to the town of &lt;a href=\"Giurgiu\"&gt;Giurgiu&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Constantinople. She made a similar trip up the Danube in 1869, and also stopped in &lt;a href=\"Varna%2C%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Varna, Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; on the way back to Constantinople.\nIn October, \"Delphin\" took &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt;, Greece to Constantinople, where he met Sultan &lt;a href=\"Abd%C3%BClaziz\"&gt;Abd\u00fclaziz&lt;/a&gt;. Friedrich Wilhelm then moved to the corvette , and on 28 October, \"Delphin\" was sent to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Said\"&gt;Port Said&lt;/a&gt;, where the opening ceremonies of the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt; were scheduled to take place on 17 November. There, she investigated the possibility of Friedrich Wilhelm transiting the canal aboard \"Hertha\". She remained there for the ceremonies, staying there until 10 December when she returned to Constantinople. On 11 April 1870, \"Delphin\" received the order to return to Prussia, though she was damaged off the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Tagus\"&gt;Tagus&lt;/a&gt; River in Portugal, forcing her to put into &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; for repairs. She reached &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; on 16 June, where she rendezvoused with the &lt;a href=\"armored%20frigate\"&gt;armored frigate&lt;/a&gt; and the artillery &lt;a href=\"school%20ship\"&gt;school ship&lt;/a&gt; from the Armored Squadron. Three days later, she joined the Armored Squadron for a cruise in the Atlantic, though on 22 June, \"Delphin\" and \"Renown\" were detached to return to Prussia. They arrived in Kiel on 28 June, where \"Delphin\" was decommissioned on 11 July.\n\"Delphin\" was in need of repairs after her lengthy tour in the Mediterranean; as a result, she was not recommissioned when the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; broke out eight days after her decommissioning. The vessel was ready to return to service only by 22 April 1871, by which time the war was all but over. She was ordered to begin another deployment to the Mediterranean on 13 May, but her departure was delayed until 29 August. The ship stopped in Algiers on 29 September and &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt; on 1 October, both in &lt;a href=\"French%20North%20Africa\"&gt;French North Africa&lt;/a&gt;; the stops occurred without incident. On 25 October, \"Delphin\" arrived in Constantinople. The navy ministry had intended to use \"Delphin\" to carry the archaeologist &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Curtius\"&gt;Ernst Curtius&lt;/a&gt; back from Piraeus, but he left on another vessel on 12 October, while \"Delphin\" was still en route. In February 1872, she carried &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Friedrich%20Karl%20of%20Prussia%20%281828%E2%80%9385%29\"&gt;Prince Friedrich Karl&lt;/a&gt; on his tour of Greece and the Ottoman Empire, making stops in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, Greece, and &lt;a href=\"Chios\"&gt;Chios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bursa\"&gt;Bursa&lt;/a&gt;, and Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. \"Delphin\" cruised the Danube in October and November that year. In early March 1873, the navy sent \"Delphin\" to Spain to join the ironclad and the corvette to protect German interests during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;Third Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;. The German vessels, commanded by now-\"&lt;a href=\"Konteradmiral\"&gt;Konteradmiral&lt;/a&gt;\" (Rear Admiral) von Werner, joined a British squadron. The Anglo-German force blockaded &lt;a href=\"Cartagena%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Cartagena&lt;/a&gt;, which was then controlled by the rebel faction, and attacked two rebel-controlled ironclads, forcing them to surrender.\nOn 4 October, \"Delphin\" was replaced by her sister . \"Delphin\" returned to Kiel, where on 4 December, she was once again decommissioned. Work then began to convert her into a &lt;a href=\"survey%20vessel\"&gt;survey vessel&lt;/a&gt;; this included removal of her armament, construction of a &lt;a href=\"deck%20house\"&gt;deck house&lt;/a&gt;, replacement of her barquentine rig with a &lt;a href=\"barque\"&gt;barque&lt;/a&gt; rig, and the installation of a new &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The work was finished by April 1874, and she thereafter began survey work with her similarly converted sister . \"Delphin\" was again decommissioned for the winter on 21 October. She returned to service each year through 1879 during the summer months, before being decommissioned each year in October or November. During this period, she surveyed the area around &lt;a href=\"Heligoland\"&gt;Heligoland&lt;/a&gt; in 1877 and covered some of the Baltic between 1878 and 1879. In 1880 she had her rigging removed, and though not officially commissioned, took part in the raising of the &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt; in October and November, which had been sunk in &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; tests with the aviso on 14 July. \"Delphin\" was recommissioned a last time on 15 March 1881 for service as a fishery protection ship, but this service was short-lived. \"Delphin\" was decommissioned on 13 August, stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; on 30 September, and thereafter sold to &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;ship breakers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt;."
