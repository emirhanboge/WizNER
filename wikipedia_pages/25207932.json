At the age of fifteen, he was sent to college but within the year he ran away to join the &lt;a href=\"Filibuster%20%28military%29\"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; of General &lt;a href=\"William%20Walker%20%28filibuster%29\"&gt;William Walker&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; but his party was intercepted by American officials. Escaping the authorities he made his way home. His father decided to give him money and send him to California.\nCareer.\nHarpending made his early fortune mining in California and in Mexico prior to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1861, he joined in a &lt;a href=\"Conspiracy%20%28political%29\"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; to seize &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and create a \"Pacific Republic\" in California and &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, but the movement failed because of the loyalty and precautions of &lt;a href=\"Colonel\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"brevet%20%28military%29\"&gt;Brevet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20General\"&gt;Brigadier General&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston\"&gt;Albert Sidney Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.

Their object was to raid commerce on the Pacific coast to capture and carry gold and silver shipments back to support the Confederacy. Their attempt was detected and they were seized on the night of their intended departure by the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Cyane%20%281837%29\"&gt;USS Cyane&lt;/a&gt;, revenue officers and San Francisco police. The conspirators were tried and found guilty of treason. Harpending, and the other leaders were each sentenced to ten years in prison confined at &lt;a href=\"Alcatraz\"&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt;. A few months later President Lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation granting full pardon to all political prisoners upon the condition that they take and keep the oath of allegiance. Harpending was given his freedom in February 1864.\nBy the end of the war he was involved in mining, real estate and railroads, and founded the town of &lt;a href=\"Havilah%2C%20California\"&gt;Havilah, California&lt;/a&gt;, which became a boom town in 1865. After he was involved in the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20hoax%20of%201872\"&gt;Diamond hoax of 1872&lt;/a&gt;, he sold out in California and retired to Kentucky. However, after a few years, he moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and became involved in investment and speculation on &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;.
