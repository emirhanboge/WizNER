He had a moderately successful rookie season, and maintained his playing privileges until 1999, when he had to go back to qualifying school.\nTunnicliff was unable to regain his tour card at qualifying school and after two more years playing on the Challenge Tour and in minor European Tour events, made his breakthrough with victory in the 2002 &lt;a href=\"Great%20North%20Open\"&gt;Great North Open&lt;/a&gt; just two weeks after the death of his mother from &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. That win secured his place on the European Tour. Two years later he won his second tournament, the &lt;a href=\"Diageo%20Championship%20at%20Gleneagles\"&gt;Diageo Championship at Gleneagles&lt;/a&gt;, and that season went on to record his best year-end ranking on the European Tour Order of Merit, 34th place. He also won the &lt;a href=\"Mauritius%20Open\"&gt;Mauritius Open&lt;/a&gt; in both 2004 and 2005.
