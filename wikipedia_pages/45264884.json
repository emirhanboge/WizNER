    "text": "\"Karlsruhe\" (F223) is the fourth ship of the s of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Navy\"&gt;German Navy&lt;/a&gt;. \nDesign.\nThe Type 120 or \"K\u00f6ln\"-class frigates were built as smooth-deckers and had very elegant lines. The very diagonally cut bow and the knuckle ribs in the foredeck made it easy to navigate. The &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; were made of shipbuilding &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, other superstructure parts were made of &lt;a href=\"Aluminium\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the installation of &lt;a href=\"Gas%20turbine\"&gt;gas turbines&lt;/a&gt;, large side air inlets were necessary, which could be closed by lamellas. The stern was designed as a round stern. The large funnel was sloped and skirted. Behind the bridge superstructure stood the tall &lt;a href=\"lattice%20mast\"&gt;lattice mast&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Antenna%20%28radio%29\"&gt;antennas&lt;/a&gt;. The hull was divided into 13 watertight compartments. \nOn the forecastle was a 10 cm gun, behind it, set higher, a 4 cm twin gun. Behind it stood two quadruple anti-submarine missile launchers 37.5 cm from Bofors. A 4 cm Bofors single gun on each side of the aft superstructure and another 4 cm double mount at the end of the superstructure. There was a second 10 cm gun on the quarterdeck. In addition, there were two 53.3 cm torpedo tubes behind the front superstructures. They were used to fire Mk-44 torpedoes. Mine rails were laid behind the torpedo tubes and ran to the stern. \nConstruction and career.\n\"Karlsruhe\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 29 October 1958 and &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 15 August 1959 in &lt;a href=\"St%C3%BClcken%20%26amp%3B%20Sohn\"&gt;St\u00fclcken &amp; Sohn&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 7 April 1962.\nThe \"Karlsruhe\" was sold to &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Naval%20Forces\"&gt;Turkish Navy&lt;/a&gt; after active service in the German Navy and since 28 March 1983 sailed there under the Turkish flag as the destroyer \"Gazi Osman Pasa\" with the identification D-360. \nIn 1984 it was renamed \"Gelibolu\", but kept the Identification D-360. \nHer last decommissioning took place there on 27 June 1994.
