He finished the regular season tied for third in the American League with 36 steals. He was often used as a late inning pinch runner and defensive substitute, taking over in center field while Lorenzo Cain would shift to right field taking the place of &lt;a href=\"Norichika%20Aoki\"&gt;Norichika Aoki&lt;/a&gt;. He played in a career high 120 games and had career highs in batting average (.269) and RBIs (24) at the time.

The Royals were up 3 games to 1 in the fifth game of the World Series. In the 12th Inning, the Royals and Mets were tied at two runs each. After a single to right field, Dyson, known for his speed, pinch ran for &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Salvador Perez.&lt;/a&gt; Dyson proceeded to steal 2nd base. When &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Gordon\"&gt;Alex Gordon&lt;/a&gt; grounded out to first, Dyson got to third base. Then, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Col%C3%B3n\"&gt;Christian Col\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; singled to left allowing Dyson to reach home plate giving the Royals their first lead of the game. The Royals would finish the inning with a total of five runs, winning the game 7-2 and becoming the &lt;a href=\"2015%20World%20Series\"&gt;2015 World Series&lt;/a&gt; Champions.\n2016.\nPrior to the start of the 2016 season, Dyson and &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Orlando\"&gt;Paulo Orlando&lt;/a&gt; were considered most likely to platoon in right field, though the Royals announced plans for an open competition in spring training. On July 18, Dyson hit a grand slam against the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first of his career. That year, he played in 107 games with 83 hits across 299 at-bats. Of those, 14 were doubles and 8 were triples, each being the highest totals of his career in a year.
