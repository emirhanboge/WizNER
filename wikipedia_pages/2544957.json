    "title": "Wilhelm Peterson-Berger",
    "text": "Olof Wilhelm Peterson-Berger ( 27 February 1867, &lt;a href=\"Ull%C3%A5nger\"&gt;Ull\u00e5nger&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 3 December 1942, &lt;a href=\"%C3%96stersund\"&gt;\u00d6stersund&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"Swedes\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"music%20critic\"&gt;music critic&lt;/a&gt;. As a composer, his main musical influences were &lt;a href=\"Edvard%20Grieg\"&gt;Grieg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"August%20S%C3%B6derman\"&gt;August S\u00f6derman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt; as well as Swedish folk idiom.\nThe composer.\nPeterson-Berger studied at the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; Conservatory from 1886\u201389 and then in &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; for a year.\nHe is best known for three albums of &lt;a href=\"Romantic%20nationalism\"&gt;national romantic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt; pieces entitled \"Fr\u00f6s\u00f6blomster I, II and III\" (\"Flowers of Fr\u00f6s\u00f6\"), which includes the often performed \"Vid Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 kyrka\" (\"At Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 Church\") and \"Sommars\u00e5ng\" (\"Summer Song\"). The sets, which were composed over a period of 18 years (1896 - 1914) and brought together afterwards as a collection have gained a reputation of representing a quintessential \"Swedishness\" in the romantic, nationalistic vein of their time. The most famous of the pieces, \"Sommars\u00e5ng\" (\"Summer Song\") recalls the warm, calm, harmonious and bright pre-summer evenings where the sun in the north almost never goes down; they were the great breakthrough for Wilhelm. \"Sommars\u00e5ng\" is still known to most Swedes, even to people generally uninterested in music: the majority of young piano students in the Nordic countries have been taught this piece. His songs for vocal ensemble are also still regularly performed, and are part of the core repertoire of Swedish choirs.\nHis other works include the five &lt;a href=\"Symphony\"&gt;symphonies&lt;/a&gt; - among them are no.2 \"Sunnanf\u00e4rd\" and no.3 \"&lt;a href=\"Sami%20people\"&gt;Same-\u00c4tnam&lt;/a&gt;\" generally considered the best - as well as the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a href=\"Ran%20%28Goddess%29\"&gt;Ran&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Arnljot%20opera\"&gt;Arnljot&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Domedagsprofeterna\" (\"The Doomsday Prophets\") and \"Adils och Elisiv\" (\"Adils and Elisiv\"). His command of the larger forms, in both &lt;a href=\"musical%20form\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"instrumentation%20%28music%29\"&gt;instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;, is disputed.\nHe was stage manager at the Stockholm Opera from 1908-10. The opera \"Arnljot\" has nevertheless become something of a symbol for the province of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4mtland\"&gt;J\u00e4mtland&lt;/a&gt; and is regularly performed there, as a \"&lt;a href=\"musical%20drama\"&gt;musical drama&lt;/a&gt;\", at Arnljotl\u00e4gden on &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%B6s%C3%B6n\"&gt;Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt;, close to Peterson-Berger's former home, Sommarhagen. \"Domedagsprofeterna\" is the antithesis of \"Arnljot\" \u2013 a light festive musical comedy set in 17th century &lt;a href=\"Uppsala\"&gt;Uppsala&lt;/a&gt;, while the saga \"Adils och Elisiv\" where Swedish \u2018tals\u00e5ng\u2019 (speechsong) attained its purest expression is a work extolling Peterson-Berger's belief in humanism and the goodness of man.\nHe also wrote about eighty songs, many of which set poems by &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Axel%20Karlfeldt\"&gt;Erik Axel Karlfeldt&lt;/a&gt;, for example \"Asp\u00e5kers&lt;a href=\"Polska%20%28dance%29\"&gt;polska&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCritic and writer.\nAs well as being a composer, Peterson-Berger was also a respected though very controversial music &lt;a href=\"critic\"&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Dagens%20Nyheter\"&gt;Dagens Nyheter&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"News of the Day\") from 1896-1930. He was conservative and fought the increasing influence of &lt;a href=\"Modernism%20%28music%29\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt; in music, especially from &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Schoenberg\"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. His progress was hindered by many enemies whom he made through his writings; he attacked showy virtuosity and dry academicism with satire but also with strict conscientiousness. For either composers or performers who did not conform to his taste (or who were young and insecure female musicians, to take one typical example), he was not above grave personal insults.&lt;br&gt; \nOther writings include \u2018Svensk musikkultur\u2019 (Swedish musical culture, 1911) which includes clearsighted and satirical attacks on the prevailing musical establishment, \u2018Richard Wagner som kulturf\u00f6reteelse\u2019 (Richard Wagner as a cultural phenomenon, 1913) as well as translations of &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20und%20Isolde\"&gt;Tristan und Isolde&lt;/a&gt; (for a 1909 production in Stockholm), and &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Nietzsche\"&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"The%20Birth%20of%20Tragedy\"&gt;The Birth of Tragedy&lt;/a&gt; (1902) and &lt;a href=\"Thus%20Spoke%20Zarathustra\"&gt;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&lt;/a&gt; (1919).\nThe man.\nOne acquaintance later recalled his surprise when, on a journey by train from Stockholm to \u00d6stersund and Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n, the big man and notorious critic suddenly burst into tears and felt soft like a child as the bucolic landscape of his beloved J\u00e4mtland began to unfold outside the window. Even this writer, however, noted that even Peterson-Berger's threatening and miserable physical appearance and demeanour conformed to the stereotype of the dour Scandinavian.\nHis home on the island of &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%B6s%C3%B6n\"&gt;Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; near \u00d6stersund (where he spent his summers from 1914 and then lived permanently from 1930) is open to the public in the summer months and is much as the composer left it. The downstairs music hall has his grand piano (he was a competent pianist), a work room (with a \u2018picture window\u2019 looking out over Storsj\u00f6n) and library (with his collection of books and scores), while upstairs the bedrooms may be viewed. He lived alone there with a butler and his cats. There is also a small caf\u00e9 where books and CDs are sold.\nReferences.\nNationalencyklopedin, band 15 (1994) (\"&lt;a href=\"Swedish%20National%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Swedish National Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\", in &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;)\nPercy G.
