    "text": "Parkrun (stylised as parkrun) is a collection of &lt;a href=\"5K%20run\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; events for walkers, runners and volunteers that take place every Saturday morning at more than 2,000 locations in 23 countries across five continents. Junior Parkrun (stylised as junior parkrun) is a spin-off event that provides a event for children aged 4\u201314 on a Sunday morning. Parkrun events are free to enter and are delivered by volunteers, supported by a small group of staff at its headquarters.\nParkrun was founded by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Sinton-Hewitt\"&gt;Paul Sinton-Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; on 2 October 2004 at &lt;a href=\"Bushy%20Park\"&gt;Bushy Park&lt;/a&gt; in London, England. The event was originally called the &lt;a href=\"Bushy%20Parkrun\"&gt;Bushy Park Time Trial&lt;/a&gt;. It grew into a network of similar events called the UK Time Trials, before adopting the name Parkrun in 2008 and expanding into other countries. The first event outside of the United Kingdom was launched in Zimbabwe in 2007, followed by Denmark in 2009, South Africa and Australia in 2011 and the USA in 2012. Sinton-Hewitt received a &lt;a href=\"CBE\"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt; for his services to grassroots sport in 2014. By October 2018 over 5 million runners were registered worldwide.\nEvents take place at a range of general locations including parks, stately homes, forests, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, beaches, promenades, prisons and nature reserves. Until September 2021, participants who had completed 50, 100, 250 or 500 runs were rewarded with a free T-shirt, but the milestone T-shirts are no longer free. A purple milestone T-shirt was available for free to those who volunteered on 25 different occasions, but along with the introduction for a charge for the T-shirts, more volunteer T-shirts were introduced, additionally marking 50, 100, 250 and 500 volunteer occasions. Runners can travel to and complete any Parkrun, those that travel are termed \"tourists\" and can complete challenges. The male record holder is &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Baddeley\"&gt;Andrew Baddeley&lt;/a&gt; with a time of 13 minutes and 48 seconds. The female record holder is Caitlin Adams with a time of 15 minutes and 38 seconds. The term Parkrun is now used as a measurement for 5 kilometres; runners often say \"only one Parkrun to go\" or \"this event is only x Parkruns\".\nHistory.\nParkrun was founded by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Sinton-Hewitt\"&gt;Paul Sinton-Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; on 2 October 2004 at &lt;a href=\"Bushy%20Park\"&gt;Bushy Park&lt;/a&gt; in London, England. Sinton-Hewitt was born in &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and went to &lt;a href=\"Potchefstroom%20High%20School%20for%20Boys\"&gt;Potchefstroom High School for Boys&lt;/a&gt; as a boarder in South Africa. He became a &lt;a href=\"running%20club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; runner with a personal best time in the marathon of 2 hours and 36 minutes. In 2004, Sinton-Hewitt was suffering from &lt;a href=\"depression%20%28mood%29\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and unable to run due to an injury. He founded Parkrun because he wanted to continue to spend time with his running friends. In a &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%204\"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt; interview he said that the idea for Parkrun came from his time in South Africa 20 years earlier where he had experienced competitive races that took place on the same course at the same time each week. The first event had 13 runners, three volunteers and was managed by Sinton-Hewitt.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bushy%20Parkrun\"&gt;Bushy Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; was originally known as the Bushy Park Time Trial, and its results were timed with a &lt;a href=\"stopwatch\"&gt;stopwatch&lt;/a&gt;, recorded on paper while &lt;a href=\"washer%20%28hardware%29\"&gt;washers&lt;/a&gt; stamped with a finish number were used as finishing tokens. Over the next two years the event took place every week with the number of participants and volunteers growing, and new technology introduced to streamline the processing of results. The second Time Trial was launched at &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20Common\"&gt;Wimbledon Common&lt;/a&gt; in 2007; it was here that the model of having an identical structure at different locations began. That year saw a further six events established. They were initially known as the UK Time Trials before the \"parkrun\" name was adopted. There were five more locations added in 2008 including the first in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and the first in &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Parkrun\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first event outside the UK was launched in &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, though this event no longer operates. The longest-running Parkrun outside the UK was launched in &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. In 2010, there were 30 new events added including the first in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011 parkrun began in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have seen significant growth in event numbers, and in 2012 Parkrun USA launched. Junior Parkrun started at Bushy Park in 2013. Sinton-Hewitt received a &lt;a href=\"CBE\"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 for his \"services to grassroots sport\".\nA 2013 article in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" noted the rapid growth of Parkrun and suggested this was mainly due to its simplicity and accessibility: runners register online once, turn up at any event, and run. Inclusivity is also a factor, as participants have a wide range of running abilities, from fast &lt;a href=\"sports%20club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; runners to those walking, a wide range of ages from children running with their parents to the elderly, also allowed are wheelchair users, those pushing &lt;a href=\"baby%20carriage\"&gt;buggies&lt;/a&gt; and people running with their dog.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Public%20Health\"&gt;Journal of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;\" reported in a 2013 study upon 7,308 Parkrun participants that the events were attractive to people who described themselves as non-runners; with women, older adults and overweight people well represented. It added that participation problems have been minimized, with no upper age limit, no special equipment and no cost. And that while some participants ran before a Parkrun, some are new to exercise, and Parkrun offered the opportunity and support to become active on a continuous weekly basis.\nA 2015 qualitative study by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Loughborough\"&gt;University of Loughborough&lt;/a&gt; found that runners attending a Parkrun for the first time were typically motivated for &lt;a href=\"weight%20loss\"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; or an improvement in their &lt;a href=\"physical%20fitness\"&gt;physical fitness&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, there were a range of different motivations for runners to continue regularly taking part, with runners wanting; to beat their &lt;a href=\"personal%20record\"&gt;personal record&lt;/a&gt; time; to reach a certain number of runs and join a milestone club; to enjoy being outdoors at the park; to make new friends through volunteering or to meet existing friends or family for the run.\nIn 2015, more than 80,000 people were gathering in parks across the world each week to run, jog and walk a Parkrun \u2013 more than twice the number who take part in the annual &lt;a href=\"London%20Marathon\"&gt;London Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, 1.1 million different people completed a Parkrun and 142,000 gave their time to volunteer. In 2018, on an average Saturday around a quarter of a million runners took part in 1,500 events spread over 20 countries.\nIn 2017 the organisation which supports global Parkrun events \"Parkrun Global Limited\" became a UK registered &lt;a href=\"charitable%20organisation\"&gt;charity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWriting in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Independent\"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;\" on 4 September 2018, Jonathan Liew, their Chief Sports Writer, said \"parkrun is not simply one of the biggest sporting events in the world, but one of the most important, largely because it entirely upends what we have long been told sport is about.\" He discusses how sport has become ever more something the public pay to watch, packaged ever more expensively, with the sports people lives tipping over into &lt;a href=\"light%20entertainment\"&gt;light entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, concluding with the comment \"parkrun offers something entirely different: community, opportunity, the outdoors, the simple pleasure of sport and people. In so doing, it has resurrected a vision of sport that has been in recession for a generation.\"\nAt the beginning of March 2020, Parkrun events were closed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Events resumed in England on 24 July 2021.\nFunding.\nParkrun events are free of charge to participants and run principally by volunteers. The majority of Parkrun's income comes from sponsorship and grants, with some commercial income from apparel, wristbands, and accessories. Donations form less than 15% of the charity's income.\nEvent outline.\nParticipating in a Parkrun.\nAll Parkruns are in length and are free to enter. Anyone can take part, from pensioners to parents with their children, people with their dogs, wheelchair users, people pushing &lt;a href=\"baby%20carriage\"&gt;prams&lt;/a&gt;, club runners or casual runners, although not all courses are suitable for all participants. Beginner runners, older adults and overweight people are common.\nThey usually take place at the same time, at the same place, on the same course, once per week. There is no formal procedure before the run with participants asked to arrive shortly before the start time and wait near the starting line. A run director will make announcements giving safety instructions and community news before beginning the run. Participants run or walk the course and are directed by marshals along the correct route to the finish line. As each runner enters the finish funnel, a volunteer records the finishing place number and time. The information recorded by the timers is later uploaded onto a computer, which allows runners to be matched with their times. The results are uploaded to the Parkrun website which also generates a number of statistics. The results available are finishing position for both male and female runners, the time taken to complete the run, whether or not a personal best time has been run, the total number of runs completed by an individual, their &lt;a href=\"age%20grade\"&gt;age grade&lt;/a&gt; result and their position in relation to other veteran or junior runners.\nTo have a time recorded, runners are asked to register on the Parkrun website, print out a personal I.D. that includes a &lt;a href=\"barcode\"&gt;barcode&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to each event. This needs to be done just once, with the barcode valid for any subsequent Parkrun in the world. Runners can still participate without registering or if they forget to bring their personal barcode, but they will not have their time recorded. If the runner does not have a barcode, their position on the finishers table will be recorded with the name \"unknown\" and no time. After passing the finish line, each runner is handed a \"finish token\" corresponding to their position. This is later scanned alongside their personal barcode, if they have one, to link their result with their Parkrun profile.\nOccasionally, a runner may leave the finish funnel without receiving a finish token. This is known as \"funnel ducking\", and can lead to subsequent finish times becoming mismatched. This issue can usually be rectified by having a volunteer join the funnel in place of the ducker, to take a token on their behalf, or by removing their time entirely. Similar issues can arise if someone joins the funnel from the side without having their time recorded, or if a runner refuses to take a finish token.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that \"what's clever is that it\u2019s not a race against everyone else but a timed run\", and that trying to improve your personal best time is a great incentive even for slower runners. The paper further explained that the success of the events is down to them being free and weekly because it allows people to get into a routine.\nAn article in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" said that a drop in &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; usage can be attributed to a backlash against gym membership fees combined with the popularity of events such as Parkrun and &lt;a href=\"Activity%20tracker\"&gt;fitness tracking devices&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral locations.\nEvents take place in a range of general locations (that need not actually be a park), including &lt;a href=\"city%20parks\"&gt;city parks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"country%20parks\"&gt;country parks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"national%20parks\"&gt;national parks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stately%20homes\"&gt;stately homes&lt;/a&gt;, castles, forests, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, beaches, &lt;a href=\"promenade\"&gt;promenade&lt;/a&gt;s, prisons, racecourses and &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserves\"&gt;nature reserves&lt;/a&gt;. The runs have different degrees of difficulty, with hilly runs harder to complete than those that are flat. The running surface varies with many city park Parkruns being run on &lt;a href=\"Tarmacadam\"&gt;tarmac&lt;/a&gt; footpaths, closed roads, grass or a mixture of all three, while forest and country park Parkruns are more likely to be on &lt;a href=\"trails\"&gt;trails&lt;/a&gt;. The weather affects the difficulty of the course with trail runs more liable to be affected by mud or leaves than runs on tarmac paths. Runs that take place in hotter countries often start early in the morning to avoid excess heat and runs in snowier climates have a course chosen to minimise the effect of the snow.\nPermanent event closures are rare. &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; was the first country to host a Parkrun outside the UK, the event started in 2007 but closed several years later. Parkrun Elli\u00f0a\u00e1rdalur closed in 2012 due to operational difficulties in the winter, and Hiller\u00f8d Parkrun in Denmark closed in 2013. Camp Bastion Parkrun was hosted at a military base in &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, which shut in 2014. &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; Parkrun (formerly held in Milton Country Park) did not restart following closure during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMore frequently, Parkruns have formally closed at a location, but have relocated to a venue nearby and changed name.\nVolunteers.\nEach Parkrun event is run entirely by &lt;a href=\"Volunteering\"&gt;volunteers&lt;/a&gt;. To assist the volunteers, Parkrun HQ provides the necessary equipment and there are several different volunteer roles at each Parkrun event. Every event has a 'volunteer' page, with the same basic information about how to get involved as a volunteer, as well as crediting those who have made the effort in the most recent week. The Parkrun website credits those who volunteer each week as \"the heart\" of Parkrun, and integral to its not-for-profit status. It also provides a useful range of responses to commonly asked questions about volunteering, with information on each of the different roles, in its FAQ section. At the outset of Parkrun, the central organisation sought to simplify the volunteering process to allow new events to be set up with a low number of volunteers, this simplification now allows new volunteers to assist with minimal training.\nEach event has a core team who has received permission from Parkrun HQ and the location owner to stage the event. The individual roles are typically filled by different volunteers each week and include the following; a run director who manages the event making announcements and starting the run; a timer who records the time taken, marshals who direct runners to the correct route, barcode scanners who scan finishing tokens, event setup and close down volunteers, tail walkers, &lt;a href=\"Pacemaker%20%28running%29\"&gt;pacers&lt;/a&gt; and result processors.\nAccording to Steve Flowers at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kent\"&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s business school, Wikipedia and parkrun are both examples of \"people\u2019s innovation\".\nJunior Parkrun.\nJunior Parkrun events are weekly, free, 2\u00a0km running events for runners aged four to fourteen. Parents are allowed to run with their children but are not eligible for a placed finish. Dogs can be brought to the event but are not allowed to run with their owners. Juniors who have completed 11, 21 or 50 junior runs are awarded a coloured wristband. Events take place on Sunday morning.\nMilestone clubs.\nThe number of runs by each participant at all events is recorded and available on the Parkrun website. When a runner reaches 50 runs they join a \"milestone club\" called the \"50 Club\" and they can claim a red Parkrun T-shirt. When a runner reaches 100 runs they join the \"100 Club\" and can claim a black T-shirt. Likewise the \"250 Club\" offers a green T-shirt and the \"500 Club\" a blue T-shirt. People under the age of 18 can claim a white T-shirt when they complete 10 runs and there is a purple T-shirt for people who volunteer 25 times. The milestone and volunteer T-shirts were free until September 2021, at which point they became chargeable. At this time, more volunteer T-shirts were introduced, to align with the milestone T-shirts; 50 (red), 100 (black), 250 (green) and 500 (blue).\nParkrun tourism and challenges.\nParkrun tourists travel especially to seek out new runs. Runners, when they sign up on the Parkrun website, are asked to pick a \"Home Parkrun\", usually the one they live closest to and are likely to frequent most. Parkrun tourism is broadly defined as anyone travelling to a run that is not their home Parkrun. Tourism can involve running in a neighbouring park, town, region or even country with some runners travelling to a different run every week.\nParkrun challenges involve completing a number of different runs in a particular way which are personally meaningful but not officially recorded. These include \"Londone\" which is completing all of the Parkruns in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The \"alphabeteer\" is running a Parkrun beginning with each letter of the alphabet and challenges such as \"Stayin' Alive\" which is completing three runs beginning with B and three beginning with G. A Google Chrome and Firefox extension details further challenges such as \"Groundhog Day\" which is running the same time at the same Parkrun location in two consecutive weeks and \"Regionnaire\" which is to complete all of the Parkruns in any region.\nList of Parkrun event countries.\nParkrun is held in the 27 different countries and territories listed below as of 1 January 2022.\nList of junior Parkrun event countries.\nThis is a list of countries which host junior Parkrun.\nEvents around the world.\nParkrun in Australia.\nThe first Australian Parkrun event was held at &lt;a href=\"Main%20Beach%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Main Beach&lt;/a&gt;, on the Gold Coast, on 2 April 2011. &lt;a href=\"ABC%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; remarking on Parkrun Australia said \"there are competitive runners aiming to win but there are just as many people running for the fun of it. If people want to race each other, that's fine, they can, but if you want to walk that is fine too. Everyone is welcome, from kids to grandparents, it's one of the few sporting events that a family can do together.\" The two biggest Parkruns in Australia are &lt;a href=\"South%20Bank%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;South Bank&lt;/a&gt; in Brisbane, Queensland and &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Park%20%0ALake\"&gt;Albert Park \nLake&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne, Victoria, the two having alternating attendance records over the years with South Bank holding the current record of 1,010 participants set on Christmas Day, 25 December 2019.\nParkrun in Germany.\nThe first three parkruns in Germany were Georgengarten parkrun in &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hannover&lt;/a&gt;, K\u00fcchenholz parkrun in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; and Neckarau parkrun in &lt;a href=\"Mannheim\"&gt;Mannheim&lt;/a&gt;, when they all hosted their first event on 2 December 2017. When Aachener Weiher parkrun started in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, it became the first parkrun in the alphabetical list of all parkruns.\nParkrun in Ireland.\nThe first run in Ireland was at &lt;a href=\"Malahide%20Castle\"&gt;Malahide Castle&lt;/a&gt; on 10 November 2012. The rollout of Parkruns in Ireland was assisted by funding from the government's Department of Health with the aim of empowering local communities and encouraging individuals and families to lead active lives. The record attendance was at Marlay Parkrun on 21 January 2017 when there were 795 runners.\nParkrun in Japan.\nParkrun was introduced for the first time to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on 6 April 2019, by the &lt;a href=\"Futako-Tamagawa%20Station\"&gt;Futako-Tamagawa&lt;/a&gt; Parkrun event, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%2C%20Japan\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. There are now 24 events held every Saturday morning in Japan. \nParkrun in New Zealand.\nThe first event was at Lower Hutt on 5 May 2012\nParkrun in Poland.\nThe first Polish Parkrun took place in &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; on 15 Oct 2011. Poland has the first Parkrun to cross the border of another country. Cieszyn Parkrun starts in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; but crosses into the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Poland. The record attendance was at Poznan Parkrun on 27 Dec 2015 when there were 1111 runners.\nParkrun in Russia.\nParkrun in Russia began simultaneously at Kolomenskoe Parkrun and Severnoe Tushino Parkrun on 1 March 2014. Parkrun Yakutsk Dohsun takes place in &lt;a href=\"Yakutsk\"&gt;Yakutsk&lt;/a&gt;, which has an average daily temperature of .\nParkrun in South Africa.\nParkrun South Africa was started and promoted by ultramarathoner &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Fordyce\"&gt;Bruce Fordyce&lt;/a&gt;. The first Parkrun took place at &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Park%20%28Johannesburg%29\"&gt;Delta Park&lt;/a&gt; in Johannesburg on 12 November 2011 and had 26 participants. It is now one of the larger Parkruns regularly drawing up to 1200 runners and attracting tourists as the first one in the nation. The world record attendance was at North Beach, &lt;a href=\"Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt;, which saw 2527 runners on 20 Jan 2018.\nParkrun in the USA.\nThe first event was at Livonia on 2 June 2012. There are 49 active events with 5 of these clustered in the Washington DC Area. \nFestive and special events.\nThere are festive and special events which do not necessarily occur on a Saturday. Each country chooses its own special event days, which are held optionally by local Parkrun teams.\nCommunity.\nHealth initiatives.\nParkrun endeavours to promote health and wellbeing through a number of initiatives. Its mission statement is \"a healthier and happier planet\". In the UK Parkrun has partnered with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20General%20Practitioners\"&gt;Royal College of General Practitioners&lt;/a&gt; in order to promote healthy living through increased physical activity, socialisation and mutual support.\nRelations with local authorities.\nMost events are run with the support and sometimes the sponsorship of local authorities. A notable conflict occurred at Little Stoke Parkrun. Parkrun does not set up events where charges would apply to the organisers or runners. Little Stoke Parkrun had begun with the council's permission in November 2012. In April 2016 the responsible &lt;a href=\"Parish%20councils%20in%20England\"&gt;parish council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20Gifford\"&gt;Stoke Gifford&lt;/a&gt;, Bristol, England, voted to charge runners a fee to participate. Despite an online petition and support from the Minister for Sport, the council would not change its decision, so the Parkrun was permanently cancelled. In April 2017 the British Government proposed that in future local councils in England would not be allowed to charge for Parkruns in a public park.\n\"Free Weekly Timed\" podcast.\nIn 2018, the \"Free Weekly Timed\" official Parkrun &lt;a href=\"podcast\"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; debuted. Originally it was co-hosted by &lt;a href=\"Vassos%20Alexander\"&gt;Vassos Alexander&lt;/a&gt; and Louise Ayling. In late 2019 Louise Ayling left the show and was replaced by Helen Williams. The podcast is broadcast weekly and gives Parkrun community news, features and entertainment."
