    "text": "Mercer is an &lt;a href=\"unincorporated%20community\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Madison%20County%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Madison County&lt;/a&gt;, Tennessee, United States. It is located along &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20State%20Route%20138\"&gt;State Route 138&lt;/a&gt; halfway between &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2040%20in%20Tennessee\"&gt;Interstate 40&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toone%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Toone&lt;/a&gt;, just east of the &lt;a href=\"Hatchie%20River\"&gt;Hatchie River&lt;/a&gt;. Mercer has a post office; its &lt;a href=\"zip%20code\"&gt;zip code&lt;/a&gt; is 38392.\nHistory.\nMercer was founded in 1888 by T. B. Mercer, for whom the community is named, at an intersection of a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; road and the Tennessee Midland Railroad. Mercer erected a &lt;a href=\"general%20store\"&gt;general store&lt;/a&gt; at the intersection, and it was followed in 1894 by a railroad station officially named Mercer. By the turn of the century, a &lt;a href=\"lumber%20yard\"&gt;lumber company&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"church%20%28congregation%29\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt; had been established in the area. The community eventually had a bank and an &lt;a href=\"opera%20house\"&gt;opera house&lt;/a&gt;, but the former &lt;a href=\"bank%20failure\"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; in 1933 and the latter &lt;a href=\"structure%20fire\"&gt;burned down&lt;/a&gt; in the late 20th century."
