    "text": "Alberto Nelson Sanchez (July 10, 1936 \u2013 October 22, 2017), known professionally as Al Hurricane, was an American singer-songwriter, dubbed \"The Godfather\" of &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico%20music\"&gt;New Mexico music&lt;/a&gt;. He released more than thirty albums, and is best known for his contributions to &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s unique style of Spanish music.\nHe received his nickname, Hurricane, from his mother. As a child, he would accidentally knock things over; the nickname became synonymous with his band, studio, and a recording label. His signature look, which included an eye-patch, was due to an automobile accident that occurred during the 1960s. These things, as well as his performance style, led to Hurricane being known for his ability to improvise and adapt. They have also led to his music and image being ultimately entangled with the history of New Mexico music.\nAl Hurricane was often accompanied on stage by his children, sons &lt;a href=\"Al%20Hurricane%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Al Hurricane, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and Jerry Dean, and daughter Erika. He also performed frequently with his brothers Baby Gaby and Tiny Morrie. He was the subject of a tribute concert which was recorded as a set of two &lt;a href=\"tribute%20album\"&gt;tribute album&lt;/a&gt;s, as well a DVD. He has also performed alongside &lt;a href=\"Fats%20Domino\"&gt;Fats Domino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Gaye\"&gt;Marvin Gaye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Berry\"&gt;Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Clanton\"&gt;Jimmy Clanton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chubby%20Checker\"&gt;Chubby Checker&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life and beginnings (1930s\u20131950s).\nAl Hurricane was born on July 10, 1936 as Alberto Nelson Sanchez the first of four children to Jose Margarito Sanchez and Bennie L. Sanchez in Dixon, New Mexico.\nThe Sanchez family moved to &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt; and the father worked in the mines until he was injured. Consequently, Bennie returned to work as a clerk at a department store in a Silver City. Jose had a band, called Los Sanchez, Bennie would often join in on vocals and guitar. She eventually became a licensed practical nurse while traveling with physicians throughout Northern New Mexico. His father and mother were extremely supportive of their children. Jose, Al's father, was a miner during most of his childhood; but he still found the time to teach the five-year-old Alberto how to play the guitar. Al's mother, Bennie, made quite a name for herself, she became the president of Hurricane Enterprises. She not only promoted her musically-inclined family, but also promoted concerts for &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Charles\"&gt;Ray Charles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chubby%20Checker\"&gt;Chubby Checker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fats%20Domino\"&gt;Fats Domino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Richard\"&gt;Little Richard&lt;/a&gt; and, the one she was particularly proud of, a 1972 &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Presley\"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; concert in Albuquerque. Her own musically talented family didn't just consist of her sons Al Hurricane, Baby Gaby and Tiny Morrie; it also consisted of Al Hurricane's sons Al Hurricane, Jr. and Jerry Dean; as well as Tiny Morrie's children &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Antonio\"&gt;Lorenzo Antonio&lt;/a&gt; and the members of &lt;a href=\"Sparx%20%28US%20band%29\"&gt;Sparx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his childhood he moved to Albuquerque, where he began to play and perform in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20Albuquerque\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 12. He attended &lt;a href=\"Albuquerque%20High%20School\"&gt;Old Albuquerque High&lt;/a&gt;, which he graduated from in 1954.\nAl Hurricane and the Night Rockers (1950s\u20131960s).\nAl became a singing waiter at the La Casita Restaurant in Old Town and, while he wasn't working, he played for tips in and around Old Town Plaza. He also began to sing and write country and rock n' roll music. During this time Al would also perform at the Sky Line Club. It was at this club, and several others, around Albuquerque and New Mexico that he built his audience. One of Al Hurricane's first &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single records&lt;/a&gt; was distributed by &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Records\"&gt;Warner Bros.

The two lead singles off that album were \"Sentimiento\" and its eponymous song \"Mi Saxophone\". \"Sentimiento\" had already been released in 1965 as a single. In 1986 Selena Quintanilla covered \"Sentimientos\" for her album \"Alpha.\"These early recordings were recorded on equipment purchased from &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Petty\"&gt;Norman Petty&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Buddy%20Holly\"&gt;Buddy Holly&lt;/a&gt; recorded on. This recording equipment gave the recordings their signature &lt;a href=\"1950s%20in%20music\"&gt;50s&lt;/a&gt; sound.\nHe began to perform outside the New Mexico music scene, performing in throughout the &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;American Southwest&lt;/a&gt; and Western United States in &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, California, &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nevada\"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wyoming\"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;; he even toured Northern &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California\"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coahuila\"&gt;Coahuila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durango\"&gt;Durango&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico City, &lt;a href=\"Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Nuevo Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tamaulipas\"&gt;Tamaulipas&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it was on his way to a concert in &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, Colorado. on November 1, 1969, where he got into a car accident in which he lost his right-eye. This did not deter him from pursuing his musical career, instead it gave him his unique performing look, an eye-patch across his right eye. He even went on to play other American cities in other regions such as Chicago and Miami; Al Hurricane has even played internationally in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Asunci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Asunci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, Buenos Aires, and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1laga\"&gt;M\u00e1laga&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl recorded several albums from 1967 to 1974, these included three albums recorded around 1973; &lt;a href=\"Canciones%20del%20Alma\"&gt;Canciones del Alma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sigue%20Cantando\"&gt;Sigue Cantando&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Corridos%20Canta\"&gt;Corridos Canta&lt;/a&gt;. These were each Spanish language releases, which continued to blend the sounds of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States'. The &lt;a href=\"Latin%20music%20%28genre%29\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Western%20music%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; sound was a hit each of the three communities of fans. Both Chicano and Country venues would be popular spots for Al Hurricane to play his music.\nAnother release at the time, &lt;a href=\"Instrumentales%20con%20Al%20Hurricane\"&gt;Instrumentales con Al Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;, saw Al return to his old &lt;a href=\"instrumental\"&gt;instrumental&lt;/a&gt; rock style of music.\nIn 1974, Al Hurricane saw two major milestones. his first full-length collaborative album with his brother Tiny Morrie; &lt;a href=\"Para%20Las%20Madrecitas\"&gt;Para Las Madrecitas&lt;/a&gt;, the album is a tribute album to their mom, and a tribute to mothers in general. It also saw \"Sentimiento\", his first hit single, selling its two-hundred-and-fifty-thousandth copy.\n\"Val de la O Show\" &amp; \"The Far West Club\" (1970s\u20131980s).\nAl Hurricane performed on a popular nationally syndicated television show called the &lt;a href=\"Val%20De%20La%20O%20Show\"&gt;Val De La O Show&lt;/a&gt;.

The music video clips also contained some of his first video appearances performing with his son, Al Hurricane, Jr., as well as his brothers Tiny Morrie and Baby Gaby.\nDuring the late 1960s, Al Hurricane, Tiny Morrie, and Bennie Sanchez purchased The Sky Line Club and renamed it \"The Far West\" in the early 1970s. From here Al performed with a band billed as Al Hurricane Band. The nightclub also became a hotspot for Country/Western and Spanish language music and dance. Artists like &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Haze%20%28band%29\"&gt;Purple Haze&lt;/a&gt; made the club their regular place to perform. It was also a spot where traveling Chicano and Tejano artists would perform, including &lt;a href=\"Selena\"&gt;Selena&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1979, father and son, Al Hurricane and Al Hurricane, Jr. recorded their first album together called &lt;a href=\"Cantan%20Corridos\"&gt;Cantan Corridos&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"La Prision de Santa Fe\" and \"Bandido\" (1980s\u20131990s).\nDuring Selena's concert in the early 1980s, which Bennie Sanchez promoted, Selena met Al Hurricane and heard him perform his song \"Sentimiento\".

It was similar in concept as Al and Morrie's previous mother related album, but it was a bit more ambitious than their previous effort. &lt;a href=\"Madrecita%2C%20Te%20Debo%20Tanto\"&gt;Madrecita, Te Debo Tanto&lt;/a&gt; also had performances by Lorenzo Antonio and Gloria Pohl, the wife of Tiny Morrie, the mother of Lorenzo Antonio.\nAfter these two projects, Al Hurricane became the lead singer in the &lt;a href=\"supergroup%20%28music%29\"&gt;supergroup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bandido%20%28supergroup%29\"&gt;Bandido&lt;/a&gt;.
