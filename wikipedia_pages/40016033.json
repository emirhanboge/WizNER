    "text": "Ha-neul, also spelled Ha-nul, is a Korean unisex name. Unlike most &lt;a href=\"Korean%20given%20name\"&gt;Korean given name&lt;/a&gt;s, which are composed of two single-syllable &lt;a href=\"Sino-Korean%20vocabulary\"&gt;Sino-Korean&lt;/a&gt; morphemes each written with one &lt;a href=\"hanja\"&gt;hanja&lt;/a&gt;, Ha-neul is an indigenous Korean name: a single two-syllable word meaning \"&lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt;\". As a name, it may loosely be interpreted as an exhortation to \"spread your dreams high like the sky\". It is one of a number of such native names (called \uace0\uc720\uc5b4 \uc774\ub984, \"goyueo ireum\"), along with others such as &lt;a href=\"Seul-ki\"&gt;Seul-ki&lt;/a&gt; (\"wisdom\") and &lt;a href=\"Sora%20%28Korean%20given%20name%29\"&gt;Sora&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"conch%20shell\"&gt;conch shell&lt;/a&gt;\"), which have become more popular in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades.\nIn some cases, parents also choose to register &lt;a href=\"hanja\"&gt;hanja&lt;/a&gt; to represent these indigenous names, picking them solely for their pronunciation. However, this is difficult for the name Ha-neul because there is only one extremely rare character with the reading \"neul\" (), and it does not appear on the South Korean government's official list of hanja which may be registered for use in given names. Instead they must choose hanja which correspond to the &lt;a href=\"homophone\"&gt;homophonous&lt;/a&gt; but differently-spelled \"Han-eul\" (\ud55c\uc744, for example or ).\nPeople.\nPeople with this name include:"
