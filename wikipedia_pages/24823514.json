    "text": "Bekwarra is a &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Areas%20of%20Nigeria\"&gt;Local Government Area&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Cross%20River%20State\"&gt;Cross River State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. Its headquarters is Abuochiche (or Abuo Chiche); a town on the &lt;a href=\"A4%20highway%20%28Nigeria%29\"&gt;A4 highway&lt;/a&gt;. Other towns in the LGA are Abuagbor-Iye, Nyanya-Ulim, Nyanya-Idigwe, Gakem, Itekpa, Ugboro, Ibiragidi, Utukwe, Afrike and Ukpah, ijibor, Beten, Ugboro, Anyikang, Ebegang, Utukpuru, Ebewo, and others.\nIt has an area of , and had a population of 105,822 as of the 2006 census.\nThe &lt;a href=\"postal%20code\"&gt;postal code&lt;/a&gt; of the area is 550.\nThe major occupation of the Bekwarra people is farming, trading, hunting and tapping of palm wine. It is known for the production of groundnut. Other crops grown in the locality include rice, maize, yam, cassava, pineapple, plantain and banana.\nThe term \u201cBekwarra\u201d is applied to the particular ethnic group, and local authorities and individuals refer to it as Bekwarra. The words 'Bekworrra' and 'Bekworrah' are still spelled out, but Bekwarra has been widely accepted because of its great consistency with the vocal system used by fellows of the ethnic group and its better suitability to the fairly scarce learned people of Bekwarra during the pre-colonial era.\nThey reside in the North portion of &lt;a href=\"Ogoja\"&gt;Ogoja&lt;/a&gt; province, in the Eastern part of Nigeria, with attached borderline to the Northern part of Nigeria. They dwell in a region at a little greater than 100 square miles and its western boundary at a distance of few miles in the Eastern part of &lt;a href=\"Ogoja\"&gt;Ogoja&lt;/a&gt; town. There are limited residential associates of other ethnic groups within this area and they appear to be a very high point of &lt;a href=\"Dialect\"&gt;dialectal&lt;/a&gt; equality."
