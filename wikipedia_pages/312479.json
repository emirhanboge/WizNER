    "text": "Korean monarchy existed in &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japanese occupation&lt;/a&gt;. After the independence and the installation of the Constitution that adopted republic system, the concept of nobility has been abolished, both formally and in practice.\nSources.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Benedictines\"&gt;Benedictines&lt;/a&gt; and other monastical orders did during Europe's &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29\"&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea's literary traditions while documenting Korea's written history and legacies from the &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; period to the end of the &lt;a href=\"Goryeo\"&gt;Goryeo&lt;/a&gt; dynasty. Korean Buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history\u2014some 500 years before &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Gutenberg\"&gt;Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to print ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court.\nRuler and princely styles.\nOriginal titles.\nThe monarchs of &lt;a href=\"Goguryeo\"&gt;Goguryeo&lt;/a&gt; adopted the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Taewang\"&gt;Taewang&lt;/a&gt;\", which placed them on the same level as the Chinese emperors. The literal translation of the title is the \"Supreme King\". The early monarchs of &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; have used the title of \"Geoseogan\", \"Chachaung\", \"Isageum\", and finally \"Maripgan\" until 503. This follows from an earlier tradition when Korean kings were styled either \"Han\" or \"Kan\", which are cognates of the Turkic \"&lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Marip\" originally meant the highest, and \"gan\" meant rulers. In addition, Baekje used the title of \"Eoraha\", \"Ha\" meaning \"rulers\" and \"Eora\" meaning \"the largest\".\nImperial titles.\nGoguryeo adopted the title, \"&lt;a href=\"Taewang\"&gt;Taewang&lt;/a&gt;\" (\ud0dc\uc655; \u592a\u738b), meaning \"Grandest of all Kings\". \n&lt;a href=\"Balhae\"&gt;Balhae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goryeo\"&gt;Goryeo&lt;/a&gt; monarchs adopted the title(s) \"Je\" (\uc81c; \u5e1d), or emperor. However, unlike the Goguryeo, the imperial titles were not used in diplomatic campaigns with the prominent Chinese Dynasties of that time. Goryeo dropped its Imperial title after the Mongolian takeover.\nThe title was revived for less than two decades during the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Empire\"&gt;Korean Empire&lt;/a&gt; that came after &lt;a href=\"Joseon\"&gt;Joseon&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoyal titles.\n\"Wang\" (&lt;a href=\"Hangul\"&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt;: \uc655; &lt;a href=\"Hanja\"&gt;Hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u738b) was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of &lt;a href=\"Gojoseon\"&gt;Gojoseon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buyeo%20kingdom\"&gt;Buyeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goguryeo\"&gt;Goguryeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baekje\"&gt;Baekje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balhae\"&gt;Balhae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goryeo\"&gt;Goryeo&lt;/a&gt;. In late Goryeo (918-1392) and the &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20Dynasty\"&gt;Joseon Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (until 1897) the rulers of Korea were still known as \"wang\", as evident in the title of &lt;a href=\"King%20Sejong%20the%20Great\"&gt;King Sejong the Great&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were referred to by their &lt;a href=\"temple%20name\"&gt;temple name&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough often translated in English as \"&lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;\", this title also applied to a female ruler. Female rulers, equivalent to &lt;a href=\"queen%20regnant\"&gt;queen regnant&lt;/a&gt; in English, were informally referred to as \"yeowang\" (&lt;a href=\"Hangul\"&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt;: \uc5ec\uc655; &lt;a href=\"Hanja\"&gt;Hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u5973\u738b) or \"female \"wang\"\".\n\"Wangbi\" (&lt;a href=\"Hangul\"&gt;Hangul&lt;/a&gt;: \uc655\ube44; &lt;a href=\"Hanja\"&gt;Hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u738b\u5983) was title for the wife of the reigning king, equivalent to &lt;a href=\"queen%20consort\"&gt;queen consort&lt;/a&gt; in English.\nPrince.\n\"Gun\" (\uad70; \u541b) is translated as \"prince\". The Royal Prince born of the Principal Royal consort (Queen) was designated \"Daegun\", translated as the Grand Prince of the Blood. The princes born of concubine was given the title \"gun\" (often distinguished as \"wangja-gun\"), translated as the Prince of the Blood. The father of the king who himself has never reigned was given the special title of \"Daewongun\" (The Grand Prince of the Blood in the Court).\nThose who has distinguished himself in the service of the court were also given the princely title as well. \"Buwongun\" (The Grand Prince of the Court), were the title of the father of the Queen, or those who have reached the rank of the Chief State Counsellor. \"Gun\" was the title of the meritorious subjects who reached the rank of the State Counsellor. These princes created for service had a prefix attached to the princely title, a town that a subject is affiliated to. Though designed as a titular appointment as a Lord of the area, the title was purely honorific.\nThe title \"gun\" can also refer to the dethroned rulers of Chos\u014fn dynasty as well. There were three dethroned kings to be called \"Gun\" in &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20Dynasty\"&gt;Joseon Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (one restored to the dignity of king posthumously).\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Empire\"&gt;Korean Empire&lt;/a&gt; (1897\u20131910), the Prince of the Blood was given the title of \"Chinwang\". While the literal translation is the Imperial King of the Blood, a more appropriate title is the Imperial Prince of the Blood. Only four \"chinwang\" were appointed.\nAristocracy before Joseon.\nSilla.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt;, the nobility was categorized by the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20rank%20system\"&gt;Bone rank system&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoyal families split into two classes: &lt;a href=\"sacred%20bone\"&gt;sacred bone&lt;/a&gt;, which meant eligibility for the royal succession, and &lt;a href=\"true%20bone\"&gt;true bone&lt;/a&gt;, until the former was extinguished.\nNon-royal nobles split into three classes: the 6th head rank, the 5th head rank and the 4th head rank; the 6th being the highest.\nGoryeo.\nAt the time of Goryeo, Korean nobility was divided into 6 classes.\nAlso the title Taeja (&lt;a href=\"hangul\"&gt;hangul&lt;/a&gt;: \ud0dc\uc790, &lt;a href=\"hanja\"&gt;hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u592a\u5b50) was given to sons of emperor not like other east Asian countries. In other countries, this title meant &lt;a href=\"crown%20prince\"&gt;crown prince&lt;/a&gt;. Taeja was similar to Chinwang (&lt;a href=\"hangul\"&gt;hangul&lt;/a&gt;: \uce5c\uc655, &lt;a href=\"hanja\"&gt;hanja&lt;/a&gt;: \u89aa\u738b) of the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Empire\"&gt;Korean Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nNoble families in Korea.\nSome clans whose social rank throughout Korean history could be considered equivalent to &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; are as follows (this is merely a sample and nowhere near the total list of families who attained and/or retained such social rank over the duration of Korea's lengthy history; families on this list are often also recognizable via their status during the Joseon era as &lt;a href=\"yangban\"&gt;yangban&lt;/a&gt; families).\nList of Noble families in Korea, such as:\nForeign noble families in Korea.\nThe Chinese &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Xia\"&gt;Ming Xia&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Yuzhen\"&gt;Ming Yuzhen&lt;/a&gt;'s son Ming Sheng was given the noble title Marquis of Guiyi by the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hongwu%20Emperor\"&gt;Hongwu Emperor&lt;/a&gt; after his surrender. Ming Sheng was then exiled to Korea at the age of 17 in 1372 by the Ming dynasty. The Korean official Yun Hui-chong's married his daughter off to Ming Sheng in March 1373. The emperor asked the Korean king to treat Ming Sheng as a foreign noble by giving his descendants and family corv\u00e9e and taxation exemptions. These were granted by a patent from the Korean king which lasted until the invading soldiers in the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20invasion%20of%20Joseon\"&gt;Qing invasion of Joseon&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Ming family's patents. The Chinese Ming family exists as the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20clan\"&gt;Korean clan&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Yeonan%20Myeong%20clan\"&gt;Yeonan Myeong clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seochok%20Myeong%20clan\"&gt;Seochok Myeong clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Namwon%20Seung%20clan\"&gt;Namwon Seung clan&lt;/a&gt;."
