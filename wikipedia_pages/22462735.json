    "text": "Richard D. Maurice (June 14, 1893 \u2013 February 5, 1955) was a pioneering filmmaker during the &lt;a href=\"silent%20film\"&gt;silent era&lt;/a&gt;. Later he became involved in labor organizing and helped found the Dining Car and Railroad Food Workers &lt;a href=\"Trade%20union\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt;. He was of &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n descent.\nEarly years.\nRichard Danal Maurice was born in &lt;a href=\"Matanzas\"&gt;Matanzas, Cuba&lt;/a&gt; on June 14, 1893. In 1903, Maurice immigrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. He lived in &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, where he owned a tailor's shop.\nEntertainment career.\nIn July 1920, he founded the Maurice Film Company. Its offices were at 184 High Street in Detroit. The film production company released two feature films almost ten years apart. \"Nobody's Children\", the company's first feature, premiered at E. B. Dudley's Vaudette Theatre in Detroit on Monday, September 27, 1920, and played widely within the eastern United States. While extensive documentation exists regarding the release of \"Nobody's Children\", no prints are known to exist.\nVery little is known about the release of \"Eleven P.M.\", Maurice's second and only known surviving feature. It is generally dated 1928, but Pearl Bowser and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Musser\"&gt;Charles Musser&lt;/a&gt; in their essay, \"Richard D. Maurice and the Maurice Film Company,\" speculate that the experimental film may have been completed the following year or possibly even 1930 because it \"possesses a cinematic style and internal evocations of other race films\" of the period. Historian &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Sampson%20%28inventor%29\"&gt;Henry T. Sampson&lt;/a&gt; described it as one of the most outstanding black films of the silent era. Bowser and Musser also praise the film by stating, \"Maurice's innovative use of cinematography\u2014location filming, unusual angles, and tracking shots as well as special, almost surrealist effects\u2014distinguish the film from its surviving counterparts of race cinema.\"\nHis involvement in the motion picture industry lasted at least until the early 1930s. He's listed as a motion picture producer in the 1930 U.S. Census. By 1936, when his daughter Wanda was baptized, he was apparently living in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvolvement in organized labor.\nIn 1940, Maurice became involved in dining-car service as a waiter for the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Line%20Railroad\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. Following his move three years later to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Central%20Railroad\"&gt;New York Central Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in the same capacity, he helped found the Dining Car and Railroad Food Workers union, local 370.\nIn 1946, Maurice began to have major disagreements with the union. His dissatisfaction with the union culminated in an &lt;a href=\"editorial\"&gt;op-ed piece&lt;/a&gt; published in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amsterdam%20News\"&gt;Amsterdam News&lt;/a&gt;\" in which he accused the union leadership of being ineffective in representing the rights of rank-and-file workers.\nIn August 1951, after he left the union, Maurice testified before a subcommittee of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary\"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, headed by Senator &lt;a href=\"James%20Eastland\"&gt;James O. Eastland&lt;/a&gt; of Mississippi. The Subcommittee Investigating Subversive Influence in the Dining Car and Railroad Food Workers Union also included Senator &lt;a href=\"Pat%20McCarran\"&gt;Pat McCarran&lt;/a&gt; of Nevada and Senator &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20V.%20Watkins\"&gt;Arthur V. Watkins&lt;/a&gt; of Utah. The subcommittee was formed in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"McCarran%20Internal%20Security%20Act\"&gt;Internal Security Act&lt;/a&gt;. During his testimony, Maurice accused &lt;a href=\"Solon%20C.%20Bell\"&gt;Solon C. Bell&lt;/a&gt;, the union's president, and several key union officials of being affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20USA\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe died in New York City on February 5, 1955.\nLegacy.\nA 2020 screening by a historical society with a panel discussion was scheduled but postponed due to the Covid epidemic."
