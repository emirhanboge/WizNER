    "text": "Bu Xiangzhi (; born December 10, 1985) is a Chinese &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; player. In 1999, he became the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20in%20China%23GM%20and%20WGM%20Titles\"&gt;10th grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; from China at the age of 13 years, 10 months and 13 days, at the time the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20prodigy\"&gt;youngest&lt;/a&gt; in history. In April 2008, Bu and &lt;a href=\"Ni%20Hua\"&gt;Ni Hua&lt;/a&gt; became the second and third Chinese players to pass the 2700 &lt;a href=\"Elo%20rating\"&gt;Elo rating&lt;/a&gt; line, after &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Yue\"&gt;Wang Yue&lt;/a&gt;.\nBu was Chinese champion in 2004. He was a member of the gold medal-winning Chinese team at the 2015 &lt;a href=\"World%20Team%20Chess%20Championship\"&gt;World Team Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"43rd%20Chess%20Olympiad\"&gt;2018 Chess Olympad&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nBu was born December 10, 1985 in &lt;a href=\"Qingdao\"&gt;Qingdao&lt;/a&gt;. At age six, Bu was first introduced to chess by an elder cousin (his grandfather was a strong \"&lt;a href=\"xiangqi\"&gt;xiangqi&lt;/a&gt;\" player), and his interest grew with his compatriot &lt;a href=\"Xie%20Jun\"&gt;Xie Jun&lt;/a&gt;'s women's world championship victory in 1991. He began taking chess seriously at the age of nine years and received early training from then on. During this time, the newspaper \"Qingdao Daily\" founded a local &lt;a href=\"chess%20club\"&gt;chess club&lt;/a&gt; which many children in the city went to, including the \"Qingdao Daily\"'s chief editor's son. His first chess book was a translation of the famous \"&lt;a href=\"My%2060%20Memorable%20Games\"&gt;My 60 Memorable Games&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Fischer\"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;, a player Bu admires. By 1993, he had already won the Qingdao Junior Chess Championship.\nIn 1997 this talent became the children's champion of the National S.T. Lee Cup. In 1998 at the age of 12, he captured the titles of national pupil champion and &lt;a href=\"World%20Youth%20Chess%20Championship\"&gt;under-14 world champion&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999 he finished seventh in the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Chin%20Nam\"&gt;Tan Chin Nam&lt;/a&gt; Grandmaster Invitational Tournament.\nYoungest grandmaster in history.\nA sponsorship contract with a &lt;a href=\"mineral%20water\"&gt;mineral water&lt;/a&gt; producer of his home city &lt;a href=\"Qingdao\"&gt;Qingdao&lt;/a&gt; enabled to him in 1999 with his coach Ji Yunqi to travel to Europe to take part there in several international chess tournaments. In autumn 1999 he achieved within two months the required three &lt;a href=\"Norm%20%28chess%29\"&gt;norm&lt;/a&gt;s for the title of Grandmaster (GM), with tournament wins at &lt;a href=\"Paks\"&gt;Paks&lt;/a&gt; GM tournament (6/9 points) in 21\u201329 September, at Kluger Memorial - &lt;a href=\"First%20Saturday%20%28chess%29\"&gt;First Saturday&lt;/a&gt; tournament (8\u00bd/11 pts) in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; in 3\u201313 October, and coming joint first in the \"Qingdao\u00a0Daily\" Cup (6/8 pts) in 18\u201323 October. He was 13 years, 10 months, and 13 days old when he scored the final norm, at the time the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20prodigy\"&gt;youngest person to achieve that title&lt;/a&gt;. He gave up the running status of the world's youngest grandmaster to &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Karjakin\"&gt;Sergey Karjakin&lt;/a&gt; in July 2002.

They played two games a day at a time control of one hour for all the moves. The margin of victory was a little flattering to Bu with Radjabov missing a number of good chances on the first day and then having a bit of a disaster on day two losing both games. Radjabov had beaten Bu in the two game final of a Cadet's event held earlier in the year on the Kasparovchess.com site. In May 2000, Bu made his first appearance in a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Chess%20Federation\"&gt;United States Chess Federation&lt;/a&gt;-rated tournament at the New York Open in New York City.
