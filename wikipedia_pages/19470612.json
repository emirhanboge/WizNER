    "text": "The Kawasaki KZ200 was a street &lt;a href=\"motorcycle\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; produced between 1977 and 1984 by &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%20Motorcycles\"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"single-cylinder%20engine\"&gt;single-cylinder engine&lt;/a&gt;, it was considered one of the biggest engine capacities of mass-production motorcycle in Indonesia in the early 1980s.\nDevelopment history.\nThe production began in 1977, starting with conventional points type &lt;a href=\"ignition%20system\"&gt;ignition system&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration lasted until the latest production batch in 1982.\nBy 1983, the motorcycle adopted the Capacitor Discharge Ignition (&lt;a href=\"Capacitor%20discharge%20ignition\"&gt;CDI&lt;/a&gt;) system until the production stopped in 1984. The early production of this specification is called Merzy CDI, while the latter were launched with new model of &lt;a href=\"fuel%20tank\"&gt;fuel tank&lt;/a&gt; and referred as Merzy Cobra.\nIt was once planned that &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20Consumer%20Products%20and%20Machinery%20Company\"&gt;Kawasaki Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; would launch a new model with improved engine capacity of 250\u00a0cc. However, due to the Indonesia's governmental regulation at that time, the plan was turned down. The regulation limited the engine capacity of maximum 200 cc for public motorcycles during the period."
