    "text": "J-pop (, \"jeipoppu\"; often stylized as J-POP; an abbreviated form of \"Japanese popular music\"), natively also known simply as , is a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in &lt;a href=\"1960s%20in%20music\"&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Beach%20Boys\"&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt;, which led to &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20rock\"&gt;Japanese rock&lt;/a&gt; bands such as &lt;a href=\"Happy%20End%20%28band%29\"&gt;Happy End&lt;/a&gt; fusing rock with &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese music&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by &lt;a href=\"New%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossover%20music\"&gt;crossover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20fusion\"&gt;fusion&lt;/a&gt; acts of the late 1970s such as &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Yellow Magic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20All%20Stars\"&gt;Southern All Stars&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Eurobeat\"&gt;Eurobeat&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s, namely &lt;a href=\"Namie%20Amuro\"&gt;Namie Amuro&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, J-pop replaced \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014dkyoku&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Lyric Singing Music\", a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene. The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music and now refers to most Japanese popular music. Popular styles of Japanese &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt; included &lt;a href=\"technopop\"&gt;technopop&lt;/a&gt; during the 1970s1980s, &lt;a href=\"city%20pop\"&gt;city pop&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, and &lt;a href=\"Shibuya-kei\"&gt;Shibuya-kei&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.\nForm and definition.\nThe origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt; inspired by the likes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the Japanese music genre called \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014dkyoku&lt;/a&gt;\", J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;. One notable singer to do so is &lt;a href=\"Keisuke%20Kuwata\"&gt;Keisuke Kuwata&lt;/a&gt;, who pronounced the Japanese word \"karada\" (\"body\") as \"kyerada\". Additionally, unlike Western music, the &lt;a href=\"major%20second\"&gt;major second&lt;/a&gt; (\"sol\" and \"la\") was usually not used in Japanese music, except &lt;a href=\"art%20music\"&gt;art music&lt;/a&gt;, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Sounds\"&gt;Group Sounds&lt;/a&gt; genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular, Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Want%20to%20Hold%20Your%20Hand\"&gt;I Want to Hold Your Hand&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rolling%20Stones\"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;' song \"&lt;a href=\"%28I%20Can%27t%20Get%20No%29%20Satisfaction\"&gt;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;\". Although Japanese pop music changed from music based on Japanese &lt;a href=\"pentatonic%20scale\"&gt;pentatonic scale&lt;/a&gt; and distortional &lt;a href=\"tetrachord\"&gt;tetrachord&lt;/a&gt; to the more occidental music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular (such as that of &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Shiina\"&gt;Ringo Shiina&lt;/a&gt;).\nAt first, the term \"J-pop\" was used only for Western-style musicians in Japan, such as &lt;a href=\"Pizzicato%20Five\"&gt;Pizzicato Five&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flipper%27s%20Guitar\"&gt;Flipper's Guitar&lt;/a&gt;, just after Japanese radio station &lt;a href=\"J-Wave\"&gt;J-Wave&lt;/a&gt; was established. On the other hand, Mitsuhiro Hidaka of &lt;a href=\"AAA%20%28band%29\"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Avex%20Trax\"&gt;Avex Trax&lt;/a&gt; said that J-pop was originally derived from the &lt;a href=\"Eurobeat\"&gt;Eurobeat&lt;/a&gt; genre. However, the term became a &lt;a href=\"blanket%20term\"&gt;blanket term&lt;/a&gt;, covering other music genres\u2014such as the majority of Japanese rock music of the 1990s.\nIn 1990, the Japanese subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Records%20%28music%20retailer%29\"&gt;Tower Records&lt;/a&gt; defined J-pop as all Japanese music belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Recording Industry Association of Japan&lt;/a&gt; except Japanese &lt;a href=\"independent%20music\"&gt;independent music&lt;/a&gt; (which they term \"J-indie\"); their stores began to use additional classifications, such as J-club, J-punk, &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20hip%20hop\"&gt;J-hip-hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20reggae\"&gt;J-reggae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Music%20in%20Japanese%20animation\"&gt;J-anime&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Visual%20kei\"&gt;Visual kei&lt;/a&gt; by 2008, after independent musicians started to release works via major labels. Ito Music City, a Japanese record store, adopted expanded classifications including Group Sounds, &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20idol\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt; of the 1970s\u20131980s, &lt;a href=\"enka\"&gt;enka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt; and established musicians of the 1970s\u20131980s, in addition to the main J-pop genres.\nWhereas rock musicians in Japan usually hate the term \"pop\", Taro Kato, a member of &lt;a href=\"pop%20punk\"&gt;pop punk&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Crusaders\"&gt;Beat Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out that the encoded &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"pop%20art\"&gt;pop art&lt;/a&gt;, was catchier than \"J-pop\" and he also said that J-pop was the music, memorable for its frequency of airplay, in an interview when the band completed their first full-length studio album under a major label, \"\", in 2005. Because the band did not want to perform J-pop music, their album featured the &lt;a href=\"1980s%20in%20music%23Pop\"&gt;1980s Pop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;. According to his fellow band member Toru Hidaka, the 1990s music that influenced him (such as &lt;a href=\"Nirvana%20%28band%29\"&gt;Nirvana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hi-Standard\"&gt;Hi-Standard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flipper%27s%20Guitar\"&gt;Flipper's Guitar&lt;/a&gt;) was not listened to by fans of other music in Japan at that time.\nIn contrast to this, although many Japanese rock musicians until the late 1980s disrespected the \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014dkyoku&lt;/a&gt;\" music, many of Japanese rock bands of the 1990s\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"Glay\"&gt;Glay&lt;/a&gt;\u2014assimilated \"kay\u014dkyoku\" into their music. After the late 1980s, &lt;a href=\"breakbeat\"&gt;breakbeat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29\"&gt;sampler&lt;/a&gt;s also changed the Japanese music scene, where expert &lt;a href=\"drummer\"&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt;s had played good rhythm because &lt;a href=\"traditional%20Japanese%20music\"&gt;traditional Japanese music&lt;/a&gt; did not have the rhythm based on rock or blues.\nHide of &lt;a href=\"Greeeen\"&gt;Greeeen&lt;/a&gt; openly described their music genre as J-pop. He said, \"I also love rock, hip hop and breakbeats, but my field is consistently J-pop. For example, hip hop musicians learn 'the culture of hip hop' when they begin their career. We are not like those musicians and we love the music as sounds very much. Those professional people may say 'What are you doing?' but I think that our musical style is cool after all. The good thing is good.\"\nHistory.\n1920s\u20131960s: Ry\u016bk\u014dka.\nJapanese popular music, called \"&lt;a href=\"ry%C5%ABk%C5%8Dka\"&gt;ry\u016bk\u014dka&lt;/a&gt;\" before being split into \"&lt;a href=\"enka\"&gt;enka&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"poppusu\",\nhas origins in the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20period\"&gt;Meiji period&lt;/a&gt;, but most Japanese scholars consider the &lt;a href=\"Taish%C5%8D%20period\"&gt;Taish\u014d period&lt;/a&gt; to be the actual starting point of \"ry\u016bk\u014dka\", as it is the era in which the genre first gained nationwide popularity. By the Taish\u014d period, Western musical techniques and instruments, which had been &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20relations%20of%20Meiji%20Japan\"&gt;introduced to Japan in the Meiji period&lt;/a&gt;, were widely used. Influenced by Western genres such as &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20music\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;, \"ry\u016bk\u014dka\" incorporated Western instruments such as the &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"harmonica\"&gt;harmonica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt;. However, the melodies were often written according to the traditional Japanese &lt;a href=\"pentatonic%20scale\"&gt;pentatonic scale&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1930s, &lt;a href=\"Ichiro%20Fujiyama\"&gt;Ichiro Fujiyama&lt;/a&gt; released popular songs with his &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; voice. Fujiyama sang songs with a lower volume than &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"microphone\"&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt; (the technique is sometimes called \"&lt;a href=\"Crooner\"&gt;crooning&lt;/a&gt;\").\nJazz musician &lt;a href=\"Ryoichi%20Hattori\"&gt;Ryoichi Hattori&lt;/a&gt; attempted to produce Japanese native music which had a \"flavor\" of &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe composed &lt;a href=\"Noriko%20Awaya\"&gt;Noriko Awaya&lt;/a&gt;'s hit song \"Wakare no Blues\" (lit. \"Farewell Blues\"). Awaya became a famous popular singer and was called \"Queen of Blues\" in Japan. Due to pressure from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; during the war, the performance of jazz music was temporarily halted in Japan. Hattori, who stayed in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the war, produced hit songs such as &lt;a href=\"Shizuko%20Kasagi\"&gt;Shizuko Kasagi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Tokyo Boogie-Woogie\" and &lt;a href=\"Ichiro%20Fujiyama\"&gt;Ichiro Fujiyama&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Aoi Sanmyaku\" (lit. \"Blue Mountain Range\"). Hattori later became known as the \"Father of Japanese \"poppusu\"\". The &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; soldiers\u2014who were &lt;a href=\"occupation%20of%20Japan\"&gt;occupying Japan&lt;/a&gt; at the time\u2014and the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Network\"&gt;Far East Network&lt;/a&gt; introduced a number of new musical styles to the country. &lt;a href=\"Boogie-woogie\"&gt;Boogie-woogie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mambo%20%28music%29\"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blues\"&gt;Blues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Country%20music\"&gt;Country music&lt;/a&gt; were performed by Japanese musicians for the American troops. &lt;a href=\"Chiemi%20Eri\"&gt;Chiemi Eri&lt;/a&gt;'s cover song \"&lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Waltz\"&gt;Tennessee Waltz&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952), &lt;a href=\"Hibari%20Misora\"&gt;Hibari Misora&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Omatsuri Mambo\" (1952), and &lt;a href=\"Izumi%20Yukimura\"&gt;Izumi Yukimura&lt;/a&gt;'s cover song \"&lt;a href=\"Till%20I%20Waltz%20Again%20with%20You\"&gt;Till I Waltz Again with You&lt;/a&gt;\" (1953) also became popular. Foreign musicians and groups, including &lt;a href=\"JATP\"&gt;JATP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Armstrong\"&gt;Louis Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, visited Japan to perform. In the mid-1950s, became a popular venue for live jazz music. Jazz had a large impact on Japanese \"poppusu\", though \"authentic\" jazz did not become the mainstream genre of music in Japan. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Japanese pop was polarized between urban \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" and modern \"enka\".\nModern J-pop is also sometimes believed to have had its roots with &lt;a href=\"Shidaiqu\"&gt;Chinese immigrant jazz musicians&lt;/a&gt; who had fled &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;communist takeover&lt;/a&gt;, and were collaborating with the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Japan\"&gt;U.S.-occupied forces&lt;/a&gt; to help introduce s variety of new genres to the Japanese public. In 1949, when the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt; took over and established the &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first actions taken by the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20China\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; was to denounce popular music (specifically both Chinese pop music, known as &lt;a href=\"Mandopop\"&gt;Mandopop&lt;/a&gt;, and Western pop music) as &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Music\"&gt;decadent music&lt;/a&gt;, and for decades afterwards the Communist Party would promote &lt;a href=\"Political%20music%20in%20China%23Birth%20of%20Revolutionary%20songs%20%281949-1970s%29\"&gt;Chinese revolutionary songs&lt;/a&gt; while suppressing Chinese folk songs, Chinese pop songs and Western pop songs. Dissatisfied with &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Chairman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;'s new music policies, a number of Shanghainese jazz musicians fled to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; colony of &lt;a href=\"British%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and established &lt;a href=\"Cantopop\"&gt;Cantopop&lt;/a&gt;, which is pop music sung in the &lt;a href=\"Cantonese\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt; dialect of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. However, a few musicians instead settled in Japan, where they became members of the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Network\"&gt;Far East Network&lt;/a&gt; and collaborated with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;American soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to help expose the Japanese public to a wide variety of western genres. This eventually lead to the establishment of modern Japanese pop music, known as \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014dkyoku&lt;/a&gt;\".\n1960s: Origin of modern style.\nRokabir\u012b Boom and Wasei pops.\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, many Kay\u014dkyoku groups and singers gained experience performing on US military bases in Japan. Around the same time, &lt;a href=\"Yakuza\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Kazuo%20Taoka\"&gt;Kazuo Taoka&lt;/a&gt; reorganized the concert touring industry by treating the performers as professionals. Many of these performers later became key participants in the J-pop genre.\nIn 1956, Japan's &lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt; craze began, due to the country music group known as Kosaka Kazuya and the Wagon Masters; their rendition of &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Presley\"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"&lt;a href=\"Heartbreak%20Hotel\"&gt;Heartbreak Hotel&lt;/a&gt;\" helped to fuel the trend. The music was called \"&lt;a href=\"rockabilly\"&gt;rockabilly&lt;/a&gt;\" (or \"rokabir\u012b\") by the Japanese media. Performers learned to play the music and translate the lyrics of popular American songs, resulting in the birth of . The rockabilly movement would reach its peak when 45,000 people saw the performances by Japanese singers at the first Nichigeki Western Carnival in one week of February 1958.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyu%20Sakamoto\"&gt;Kyu Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt;, a fan of Elvis, made his stage d\u00e9but as a member of the band &lt;a href=\"The%20Drifters%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;The Drifters&lt;/a&gt; at the Nichigeki Western Carnival in 1958. His 1961 song \"Ue wo Muite Aruk\u014d\" (\"Let's Look Up and Walk\"), known in other parts of the world as \"&lt;a href=\"Sukiyaki%20%28song%29\"&gt;Sukiyaki&lt;/a&gt;\", was released to the United States in 1963. It was the first Japanese song to reach the Number One position in the United States, spending four weeks in \"&lt;a href=\"Cash%20Box\"&gt;Cash Box&lt;/a&gt;\" and three weeks in \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\". It also received a &lt;a href=\"Music%20recording%20sales%20certification\"&gt;gold record&lt;/a&gt; for selling one million copies. During this period, female duo &lt;a href=\"The%20Peanuts\"&gt;The Peanuts&lt;/a&gt; also became popular, singing a song in the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Mothra%20%28film%29\"&gt;Mothra&lt;/a&gt;\". Their songs, such as \"Furimukanaide\" (\"Don't Turn Around\") were later covered by &lt;a href=\"Candies%20%28group%29\"&gt;Candies&lt;/a&gt; on their album \"Candy Label\". Artists like Kyu Sakamoto and The Peanuts were called .\nAfter frequently changing members, &lt;a href=\"Chosuke%20Ikariya\"&gt;Chosuke Ikariya&lt;/a&gt; re-formed The Drifters in 1964 under the same name. At a Beatles concert in 1966, they acted as curtain raisers, but the audience generally objected. Eventually, The Drifters became popular in Japan, releasing \"Zundoko-Bushi\" (\"Echoic word tune\") in 1969. Along with \"enka\" singer &lt;a href=\"Keiko%20Fuji\"&gt;Keiko Fuji&lt;/a&gt;, they won \"the award for mass popularity\" at the &lt;a href=\"12th%20Japan%20Record%20Awards\"&gt;12th Japan Record Awards&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. Keiko Fuji's 1970 album \"Shinjuku no Onna/'Enka no Hoshi' Fuji Keiko no Subete\" (\"Woman in Shinjuku/'Star of \"Enka\" All of Keiko Fuji\") established an all-time record in the history of the Japanese &lt;a href=\"Oricon\"&gt;Oricon&lt;/a&gt; chart by staying in the Number One spot for 20 consecutive weeks. The Drifters later came to be known as television personalities and invited &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20idol\"&gt;idols&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Momoe%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Momoe Yamaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and Candies to their television program.\nEreki boom and group sounds.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ventures\"&gt;The Ventures&lt;/a&gt; visited Japan in 1962, causing the widespread embrace of the &lt;a href=\"electric%20guitar\"&gt;electric guitar&lt;/a&gt; called the \"\"Ereki\" boom\". &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%ABz%C5%8D%20Kayama\"&gt;Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Takeshi%20Terauchi\"&gt;Takeshi Terauchi&lt;/a&gt; became famous players of electric guitar. In 1966, &lt;a href=\"the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt; came to Japan and sang their songs at the &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Budokan\"&gt;Nippon Budokan&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt; band to perform a concert there. The public believed that the Beatles would cause &lt;a href=\"juvenile%20delinquency\"&gt;juvenile delinquency&lt;/a&gt;. The Japanese government deployed &lt;a href=\"riot%20police\"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt; against young rock fans at the Nippon Budokan. &lt;a href=\"John%20Lennon\"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; felt that they were not well regarded in Japan, but &lt;a href=\"Beatlemania\"&gt;Beatlemania&lt;/a&gt; has never really died there. The Beatles inspired Japanese bands, creating the &lt;a href=\"group%20sounds\"&gt;group sounds&lt;/a&gt; genre in Japan.\nMost Japanese musicians felt that they could not sing rock in &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, so the popularity of Japanese rock gradually declined. As a result, there were debates such as \"Should we sing rock music in Japanese?\" and \"Should we sing in English?\" between &lt;a href=\"Happy%20End%20%28band%29\"&gt;Happy End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%ABya%20Uchida%20%28singer/actor%29\"&gt;Yuya Uchida&lt;/a&gt; about Japanese rock music. This confrontation was called . Happy End proved that rock music could be sung in Japanese, and one theory holds that their music became one of the origins of modern J-pop. The Beatles also inspired &lt;a href=\"Eikichi%20Yazawa\"&gt;Eikichi Yazawa&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up in an underprivileged family, his father dying when he was a child. &lt;a href=\"Keisuke%20Kuwata\"&gt;Keisuke Kuwata&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up in a dual-income family, was influenced by the Beatles through his older sister, then an avid fan. &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dsui%20Inoue\"&gt;Y\u014dsui Inoue&lt;/a&gt; was also a fan of The Beatles, but he said that his music style was not particularly related to them. After Happy End disbanded in 1973, &lt;a href=\"Haruomi%20Hosono\"&gt;Haruomi Hosono&lt;/a&gt;, a former member, began a solo career and later formed &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Yellow Magic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.\n1970s: Development of \"new music\".\n\"F\u014dku\" and new music.\nIn the early 1960s, some Japanese music became influenced by the &lt;a href=\"American%20folk%20music%20revival\"&gt;American folk music revival&lt;/a&gt;; this was called , although the genre of music was mostly covers of original songs. In the late 1960s, &lt;a href=\"the%20Folk%20Crusaders\"&gt;the Folk Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; became famous and the underground music around that time became called \"f\u014dku\". As with \"enka\", Japanese \"f\u014dku\" singers Wataru Takada performed social satires.\nIn the early 1970s, the emphasis shifted from \"f\u014dku\"s simple songs with a single guitar accompaniment to more complex musical arrangements known as . Instead of social messages, the songs focused on more personal messages, such as love. In 1972, singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Takuro%20Yoshida\"&gt;Takuro Yoshida&lt;/a&gt; produced a hit song \"Kekkon Shiyouyo\" (\"Let's marry\") without decent television promotion, though fans of \"f\u014dku\" music became very angry because his music seemed to be a mersh music. The highest-selling single of the year was the \"enka\" song by &lt;a href=\"Shiro%20Miya\"&gt;Shiro Miya&lt;/a&gt; and the Pinkara Trio, \"&lt;a href=\"Onna%20no%20Michi\"&gt;Onna no Michi&lt;/a&gt;\". The song eventually sold over 3.25\u00a0million copies. On December 1, 1973, &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dsui%20Inoue\"&gt;Y\u014dsui Inoue&lt;/a&gt; released the album \"&lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dri%20no%20Sekai\"&gt;K\u014dri no Sekai&lt;/a&gt;\", which topped the Oricon charts and remained in Top 10 for 113 weeks. It spent 13 consecutive weeks in the number-one spot, and eventually established a still-standing record of a total 35 weeks at the number-one position on the Oricon charts. &lt;a href=\"Yumi%20Matsutoya\"&gt;Yumi Matsutoya&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known by her maiden name Yumi Arai, also became a notable singer-songwriter during this period In October 1975, she released a single \"Ano Hi ni Kaeritai\" (\"I want to return to that day\"), making it her first number-one single on the Oricon charts. &lt;a href=\"Miyuki%20Nakajima\"&gt;Miyuki Nakajima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amii%20Ozaki\"&gt;Amii Ozaki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Junko%20Yagami\"&gt;Junko Yagami&lt;/a&gt; were also popular singer-songwriters during this period. At first, only Yumi Matsutoya was commonly called a new music artist, but the concept of Japanese \"f\u014dku\" music changed around that time. In 1979, &lt;a href=\"Chage%20and%20Aska\"&gt;Chage and Aska&lt;/a&gt; made their debut, and folk band &lt;a href=\"Off%20Course\"&gt;Off Course&lt;/a&gt; (with singer &lt;a href=\"Kazumasa%20Oda\"&gt;Kazumasa Oda&lt;/a&gt;) released a hit song \"Sayonara\" (\"Good-bye\").\nEmergence of Japanese rock and electronic music.\n&lt;a href=\"Rock%20music\"&gt;Rock music&lt;/a&gt; remained a relatively &lt;a href=\"underground%20music\"&gt;underground music&lt;/a&gt; genre in the early 1970s in Japan, though &lt;a href=\"Happy%20End%20%28band%29\"&gt;Happy End&lt;/a&gt; managed to gain mainstream success fusing rock with traditional &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese music&lt;/a&gt;. Several Japanese musicians began experimenting with &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"electronic%20rock\"&gt;electronic rock&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable was the internationally renowned &lt;a href=\"Isao%20Tomita\"&gt;Isao Tomita&lt;/a&gt;, whose 1972 album \"Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock\" featured electronic &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt; renditions of contemporary rock and &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop songs&lt;/a&gt;. Other early examples of electronic rock records include &lt;a href=\"Inoue%20Yousui\"&gt;Inoue Yousui&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"folk%20rock\"&gt;folk rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pop%20rock\"&gt;pop rock&lt;/a&gt; album \"Ice World\" (1973) and &lt;a href=\"Osamu%20Kitajima\"&gt;Osamu Kitajima&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20rock\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"psychedelic%20rock\"&gt;psychedelic rock&lt;/a&gt; album \"&lt;a href=\"Benzaiten\"&gt;Benzaiten&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974), both of which involved contributions from Haruomi Hosono, who later started the electronic music group \"Yellow Magic Band\" (later known as Yellow Magic Orchestra) in 1977.\nIn 1978, &lt;a href=\"Eikichi%20Yazawa\"&gt;Eikichi Yazawa&lt;/a&gt;'s rock single \"Jikan yo Tomare\" (\"Time, Stop\") became a smash hit that sold over 639,000 copies. He is regarded as one of the pioneers of Japanese rock. He sought worldwide success, and in 1980 he signed a contract with the Warner Pioneer record company and moved to the West Coast of the United States. He recorded the albums \"Yazawa\", \"It's Just Rock n' Roll\", and \"Flash in Japan\", all of which were released worldwide, but were not very commercially successful. &lt;a href=\"Keisuke%20Kuwata\"&gt;Keisuke Kuwata&lt;/a&gt; formed the rock band &lt;a href=\"Southern%20All%20Stars\"&gt;Southern All Stars&lt;/a&gt; (SAS), which made their debut in 1978. Southern All Stars remains very popular in Japan today.\nIn the same year, &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Yellow Magic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (YMO) also made their official debut with their &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled album&lt;/a&gt;. The band, whose members were &lt;a href=\"Haruomi%20Hosono\"&gt;Haruomi Hosono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yukihiro%20Takahashi\"&gt;Yukihiro Takahashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryuichi%20Sakamoto\"&gt;Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt;, developed &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt;pop as it is known in Japan, in addition to pioneering &lt;a href=\"synthpop\"&gt;synthpop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electro%20music\"&gt;electro music&lt;/a&gt;. Their 1979 album \"&lt;a href=\"Solid%20State%20Survivor\"&gt;Solid State Survivor&lt;/a&gt;\" reached number one on the &lt;a href=\"Oricon\"&gt;Oricon&lt;/a&gt; charts in July 1980, and went on to sell two million records worldwide. At around the same time, the YMO albums \"Solid State Survivor\" and \"&lt;a href=\"X%E2%88%9EMultiplies\"&gt;X\u221eMultiplies&lt;/a&gt;\" held both the top two spots on the &lt;a href=\"Oricon\"&gt;Oricon&lt;/a&gt; charts for seven consecutive weeks, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat. Young fans of their music during this period became known as the . YMO had a significant impact on Japanese pop music, which started becoming increasingly dominated by &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt; due to their influence, and they had an equally large impact on electronic music across the world. Southern All Stars and Yellow Magic Orchestra symbolized the end of New Music and paved the way for the emergence of the J-pop genre in the 1980s. Both bands, SAS and YMO, would later be ranked at the top of &lt;a href=\"HMV%20Group\"&gt;HMV Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s list of top 100 Japanese musicians of all time.\n1980s: Fusion with \"kay\u014dkyoku\".\nCity pop.\nIn the early 1980s, with the spread of &lt;a href=\"car%20stereo\"&gt;car stereo&lt;/a&gt;s, the term came to describe a type of popular music that had a big city theme. &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; in particular inspired many songs of this form. During this time, music fans and artists in Japan were influenced by &lt;a href=\"album-oriented%20rock\"&gt;album-oriented rock&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Adult%20contemporary%20music\"&gt;adult contemporary&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"crossover%20%28music%29\"&gt;crossover&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"jazz%20fusion\"&gt;jazz fusion&lt;/a&gt;). City pop was affected by new music, though its origins have been traced back to the mid-1970s, with the work of the Japanese rock band &lt;a href=\"Happy%20End%20%28band%29\"&gt;Happy End&lt;/a&gt; and its former member &lt;a href=\"Haruomi%20Hosono\"&gt;Haruomi Hosono&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tatsuro%20Yamashita\"&gt;Tatsuro Yamashita&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe popularity of city pop declined when the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20asset%20price%20bubble\"&gt;Japanese asset price bubble&lt;/a&gt; burst in 1990. Its musical characteristics (except its \"cultural background\") were inherited by 1990s &lt;a href=\"Shibuya-kei\"&gt;Shibuya-kei&lt;/a&gt; musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Pizzicato%20Five\"&gt;Pizzicato Five&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flipper%27s%20Guitar\"&gt;Flipper's Guitar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrowth of the Japanese rock industry.\nThroughout the 1980s, rock bands such as &lt;a href=\"Southern%20All%20Stars\"&gt;Southern All Stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Succession\"&gt;RC Succession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anzen%20Chitai\"&gt;Anzen Chitai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Checkers%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;The Checkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Alfee\"&gt;The Alfee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Blue%20Hearts\"&gt;The Blue Hearts&lt;/a&gt; became popular. Anzen Chitai came from &lt;a href=\"Yosui%20Inoue\"&gt;Yosui Inoue&lt;/a&gt;'s backup band. On December 1, 1983, rock singer &lt;a href=\"Yutaka%20Ozaki\"&gt;Yutaka Ozaki&lt;/a&gt; debuted at the age of 18. In 1986, The Alfee became the first artists to play a concert in front of an audience of 100,000 people in Japan. Some Japanese musicians, such as &lt;a href=\"Bo%C3%B8wy\"&gt;Bo\u00f8wy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TM%20Network\"&gt;TM Network&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Buck-Tick\"&gt;Buck-Tick&lt;/a&gt;, were influenced by &lt;a href=\"New%20Romanticism\"&gt;New Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nBo\u00f8wy became an especially influential rock band, whose members included singer &lt;a href=\"Kyosuke%20Himuro\"&gt;Kyosuke Himuro&lt;/a&gt; and guitarist &lt;a href=\"Tomoyasu%20Hotei\"&gt;Tomoyasu Hotei&lt;/a&gt;. Their three albums reached number one in 1988, making them the first male artists to have three number-ones within a single year. Subsequent Japanese rock bands were modeled on this band. Guitarist &lt;a href=\"Tak%20Matsumoto\"&gt;Tak Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt;, who supported TM Network's concerts, formed rock duo &lt;a href=\"B%27z\"&gt;B'z&lt;/a&gt; with singer &lt;a href=\"Koshi%20Inaba\"&gt;Koshi Inaba&lt;/a&gt; in 1988.\nIn the late 1980s, &lt;a href=\"all-female%20band\"&gt;girl band&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Princess%20%28band%29\"&gt;Princess Princess&lt;/a&gt; became a successful pop-rock band. Their singles \"Diamonds\" and \"Sekai de Ichiban Atsui Natsu\" (\"World's Hottest Summer\") were ranked at the number-one and number-two spots, respectively, on the 1989 Oricon Yearly Single Charts.\nIn the late 1980s, a new trend also emerged in Japanese rock music: the \"&lt;a href=\"visual%20kei\"&gt;visual kei&lt;/a&gt;\", a movement notable by male bands who wore makeup, extravagant hair styles, and androgynous costumes. The most successful representatives of the movement are &lt;a href=\"X%20Japan\"&gt;X Japan&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as \"X\") and &lt;a href=\"Buck-Tick\"&gt;Buck-Tick&lt;/a&gt;. X Japan released their first album \"&lt;a href=\"Vanishing%20Vision\"&gt;Vanishing Vision&lt;/a&gt;\" on the indie label &lt;a href=\"Extasy%20Records\"&gt;Extasy Records&lt;/a&gt; in 1988; their album \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Blood%20%28X%20Japan%20album%29\"&gt;Blue Blood&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Music%20Entertainment%20Japan\"&gt;CBS Sony&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. \"Blue Blood\" sold 712,000 copies, and their 1991 album \"&lt;a href=\"Jealousy%20%28X%20Japan%20album%29\"&gt;Jealousy&lt;/a&gt;\" sold over 1.11\u00a0million copies. Surprisingly, X Japan were a &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band, but guitarist &lt;a href=\"Hide%20%28musician%29\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; later came under the influence of &lt;a href=\"alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt;, releasing his first solo album \"&lt;a href=\"Hide%20Your%20Face\"&gt;Hide Your Face&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1994 and launching his successful solo career.\nGolden age, decline and transfiguration of Idols.\nIn the 1970s, the popularity of female &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20idol\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt; singers such as &lt;a href=\"Mari%20Amachi\"&gt;Mari Amachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saori%20Minami\"&gt;Saori Minami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Momoe%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Momoe Yamaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Candies%20%28group%29\"&gt;Candies&lt;/a&gt; increased. Momoe Yamaguchi was one of the first \"&lt;a href=\"kay%C5%8Dkyoku\"&gt;kay\u014dkyoku&lt;/a&gt;\" singers to use the special pronunciation characteristic of J-pop. In 1972, &lt;a href=\"Hiromi%20Go\"&gt;Hiromi Go&lt;/a&gt; made his debut with the song \"Otokonoko Onnanoko\" (\"Boy and Girl\"). Hiromi Go originally came from &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20%26amp%3B%20Associates\"&gt;Johnny &amp; Associates&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1976, female duo &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Lady%20%28duo%29\"&gt;Pink Lady&lt;/a&gt; made their debut with the single \"&lt;a href=\"Pepper%20Keibu\"&gt;Pepper Keibu&lt;/a&gt;\". They released a record nine consecutive number-one singles.\nIn the 1980s, Japanese idols inherited New Music, though the term fell out of usage. &lt;a href=\"Seiko%20Matsuda\"&gt;Seiko Matsuda&lt;/a&gt; especially adopted song producers of previous generations. In 1980, her third single \"Kaze wa Aki Iro\" (\"Wind is autumn color\") reached the number-one spot on the Oricon charts. &lt;a href=\"Haruomi%20Hosono\"&gt;Haruomi Hosono&lt;/a&gt; also joined the production of her music. She eventually became the first artist to make 24 consecutive number-one singles, breaking Pink Lady's record.\nOther female idol singers achieved significant popularity in the 1980s, such as &lt;a href=\"Akina%20Nakamori\"&gt;Akina Nakamori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yukiko%20Okada\"&gt;Yukiko Okada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ky%C5%8Dko%20Koizumi\"&gt;Ky\u014dko Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yoko%20Minamino\"&gt;Yoko Minamino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Momoko%20Kikuchi\"&gt;Momoko Kikuchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dko%20Oginome\"&gt;Y\u014dko Oginome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miho%20Nakayama\"&gt;Miho Nakayama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minako%20Honda\"&gt;Minako Honda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chisato%20Moritaka\"&gt;Chisato Moritaka&lt;/a&gt;. Okada received the Best New Artist award from the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Record%20Award\"&gt;Japan Record Award&lt;/a&gt;s in 1984. Nakamori won the Grand Prix award for two consecutive years (1985 and 1986), also at the Japan Record Awards.\nJapanese idol band &lt;a href=\"Onyanko%20Club\"&gt;Onyanko Club&lt;/a&gt; made their debut in 1985, and produced popular singer &lt;a href=\"Shizuka%20Kud%C5%8D\"&gt;Shizuka Kud\u014d&lt;/a&gt;. They changed the image of Japanese idols.\nAround 1985, however, people began to be disenchanted with the system for creating idols. In 1986, idol singer &lt;a href=\"Yukiko%20Okada\"&gt;Yukiko Okada&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"Kuchibiru Network\" (\"Lips' Network\"), written by Seiko Matsuda and composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, became a hit song, but she committed suicide immediately after that.\n&lt;a href=\"Hikaru%20Genji%20%28band%29\"&gt;Hikaru Genji&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20%26amp%3B%20Associates\"&gt;Johnny &amp; Associates&lt;/a&gt; bands, made their debut in 1987. They became a highly influential rollerskating boy band, with some of their members gaining their own fame as they got older. Their song \"Paradise Ginga\", written by &lt;a href=\"Aska%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Aska&lt;/a&gt;, won the Grand Prix award at the &lt;a href=\"30th%20Japan%20Record%20Awards\"&gt;30th Japan Record Awards&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. Some of the group's backing dancers later formed &lt;a href=\"SMAP\"&gt;SMAP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe late 1980s also saw the rise of the female duo &lt;a href=\"Wink%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;Wink&lt;/a&gt;. They didn't laugh, unlike Japanese idols of former eras. Wink debuted in 1988, surpassing the popularity of the then-most popular female duo, &lt;a href=\"BaBe\"&gt;BaBe&lt;/a&gt;. Wink's song \"&lt;a href=\"Samishii%20Nettaigyo\"&gt;Samishii Nettaigyo&lt;/a&gt;\" won the grand prix award at the &lt;a href=\"31st%20Japan%20Record%20Awards\"&gt;31st Japan Record Awards&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nPopular singer &lt;a href=\"Hibari%20Misora\"&gt;Hibari Misora&lt;/a&gt; died in 1989, and many \"kay\u014dkyoku\" programs, such as \"The Best Ten\", were closed.\n&lt;a href=\"CoCo%20%28group%29\"&gt;CoCo&lt;/a&gt; made their hit debut with the 1989 single \"Equal Romance\" for the hit &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Ranma%20%C2%BD\"&gt;Ranma \u00bd&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Tetsuya%20Komuro\"&gt;Tetsuya Komuro&lt;/a&gt;, a member of TM\u00a0Network, broke Seiko Matsuda's streak of 25 consecutive number-ones by making his single \"Gravity of Love\" to debut at number-one in November 1989.\n1990s: Coining of the term \"J-pop\".\n1990\u20131997: Growing market.\nIn the 1990s, the term J-pop came to refer to all Japanese popular songs except \"&lt;a href=\"enka\"&gt;enka&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring this period, the Japanese music industry sought &lt;a href=\"marketing%20effectiveness\"&gt;marketing effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;. Notable examples of commercial music from the era were the &lt;a href=\"tie-in\"&gt;tie-in&lt;/a&gt; music from the agency &lt;a href=\"Being%20%28company%29\"&gt;Being&lt;/a&gt; and the follow-on, &lt;a href=\"Tetsuya%20Komuro\"&gt;Tetsuya Komuro&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; music.\nThe period between around 1990 and 1993 was dominated by artists from &lt;a href=\"being%20Inc.\"&gt;the Being agency&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"B%27z\"&gt;B'z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tube%20%28band%29\"&gt;Tube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"B.B.Queens\"&gt;B.B.Queens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bolan\"&gt;T-Bolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zard\"&gt;Zard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wands%20%28band%29\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maki%20Ohguro\"&gt;Maki Ohguro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deen%20%28band%29\"&gt;Deen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20View\"&gt;Field of View&lt;/a&gt;. They were called the . Many of those artists topped the charts and established new records, notably B'z, which eventually established a new record for consecutive number-one singles, surpassing Seiko Matsuda's record. B'z is the Japanese biggest selling artist of all time, according to Oricon charts and RIAJ certifications. On the other hand, Wands, regarded as a pioneer of the \"J-pop Boom\" of the 1990s, had trouble because member Show Wesugi wanted to play &lt;a href=\"alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"grunge\"&gt;grunge&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany artists surpassed the two-million-copy mark in the 1990s. &lt;a href=\"Kazumasa%20Oda\"&gt;Kazumasa Oda&lt;/a&gt;'s 1991 single \"Oh! Yeah!/Love Story wa Totsuzen ni\", &lt;a href=\"Chage%20and%20Aska\"&gt;Chage and Aska&lt;/a&gt;'s 1991 single \"&lt;a href=\"Say%20Yes%20%28Chage%20and%20Aska%20song%29\"&gt;Say Yes&lt;/a&gt;\" and 1993 single \"Yah Yah Yah\", &lt;a href=\"Kome%20Kome%20Club\"&gt;Kome Kome Club&lt;/a&gt;'s 1992 single \"&lt;a href=\"Kimi%20ga%20Iru%20Dake%20de\"&gt;Kimi ga Iru Dake de&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Children\"&gt;Mr. Children&lt;/a&gt;'s 1994 single \"&lt;a href=\"Tomorrow%20Never%20Knows%20%28Mr.%20Children%20song%29\"&gt;Tomorrow Never Knows&lt;/a&gt;\" and 1996 single \"&lt;a href=\"Namonaki%20Uta\"&gt;Namonaki Uta&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20%28band%29\"&gt;Globe&lt;/a&gt;'s 1996 single \"Departures\" are examples of songs that sold more than 2\u00a0million copies. &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20Come%20True%20%28band%29\"&gt;Dreams Come True&lt;/a&gt;'s 1992 album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Swinging%20Star\"&gt;The Swinging Star&lt;/a&gt;\" became the first album to sell over 3\u00a0million copies in Japan. Mr. Children's 1994 album \"&lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Heart%20%28album%29\"&gt;Atomic Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" established a new record, selling 3.43\u00a0million copies on Oricon charts.\nThe duo Chage and Aska, who started recording in late 1979, became very popular during this period. They released a string of consecutive hits throughout the early 1990s; in 1996, they took part in \"&lt;a href=\"MTV%20Unplugged\"&gt;MTV Unplugged&lt;/a&gt;\", making them the first Asian group to do so.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"TM%20Network\"&gt;TM Network&lt;/a&gt; disbanded in 1994, &lt;a href=\"Tetsuya%20Komuro\"&gt;Tetsuya Komuro&lt;/a&gt; became a serious song producer. The period between 1994 and 1997 was dominated by dance and techno acts from the , such as &lt;a href=\"TRF%20%28band%29\"&gt;TRF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryoko%20Shinohara\"&gt;Ryoko Shinohara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yuki%20Uchida\"&gt;Yuki Uchida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namie%20Amuro\"&gt;Namie Amuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hitomi%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Hitomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20%28band%29\"&gt;Globe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tomomi%20Kahala\"&gt;Tomomi Kahala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ami%20Suzuki\"&gt;Ami Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, Komuro was responsible for 20 hit songs, each selling more than a million copies. While Globe's 1996 album \"&lt;a href=\"Globe%20%28album%29\"&gt;Globe&lt;/a&gt;\" sold 4.13\u00a0million copies, establishing a record at the time, Namie Amuro's 1997 song \"&lt;a href=\"Can%20You%20Celebrate%3F\"&gt;Can You Celebrate?&lt;/a&gt;\" sold 2.29\u00a0million copies, is the best selling single of all time by the female solo artist in the history of Jpop. His total sales as a song producer reached 170\u00a0million copies. By 1998, Komuro's songs had become less popular. By the middle part of the first decade of the 21st century, Komuro's debt lead him to attempt the sale of his song catalog\u2014which he didn't actually own\u2014to an investor. When the investor found out and sued, Komuro tried to sell the catalog to \"another\" investor in order to pay the judgement he owed the first investor.\n&lt;a href=\"Namie%20Amuro\"&gt;Namie Amuro&lt;/a&gt;, who was arguably the most popular solo singer in the period, came from the \"&lt;a href=\"Okinawa%20Actors%20School\"&gt;Okinawa Actors School&lt;/a&gt;\", which also incubated the bands &lt;a href=\"MAX%20%28band%29\"&gt;MAX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

The group's popularity gave origin to the &lt;a href=\"Hello%21%20Project\"&gt;Hello! Project&lt;/a&gt;. Following the pattern set a decade before by the 1980s all-female &lt;a href=\"Onyanko%20Club\"&gt;Onyanko Club&lt;/a&gt;, Morning Musume spawned several splinter bands.\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, female singers such as &lt;a href=\"Hikaru%20Utada\"&gt;Hikaru Utada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayumi%20Hamasaki\"&gt;Ayumi Hamasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Misia%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Misia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mai%20Kuraki\"&gt;Mai Kuraki&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Shiina\"&gt;Ringo Shiina&lt;/a&gt; became chart-toppers who write their own songs or their own lyrics. Hikaru Utada is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Keiko%20Fuji\"&gt;Keiko Fuji&lt;/a&gt;, a popular singer of the 1970s.

Although Hamasaki became very famous, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Yoda\"&gt;Tom Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, then-chairman of her record company &lt;a href=\"Avex%20Group\"&gt;Avex Group&lt;/a&gt;, argued that her tactics were risky, because Avex disregarded the &lt;a href=\"modern%20portfolio%20theory\"&gt;modern portfolio theory&lt;/a&gt;. This concern disappeared when the company's other singers (such as &lt;a href=\"Ai%20Otsuka\"&gt;Ai Otsuka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kumi%20Koda\"&gt;Kumi Koda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Exile%20%28Japanese%20band%29\"&gt;Exile&lt;/a&gt;) also reached a certain level of popularity in the mid-2000s under Yoda's management policy. &lt;a href=\"BoA\"&gt;BoA&lt;/a&gt;, a Korean singer also a part of Avex group, also achieved high levels of success although being Korean in Japan.

Though anime music was formerly influenced by J-pop and \"visual kei\" music, Japanese indie music apparently influenced the genre at the 2006 &lt;a href=\"FanimeCon\"&gt;FanimeCon&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, after &lt;a href=\"sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; voice actress &lt;a href=\"Saki%20Fujita\"&gt;Saki Fujita&lt;/a&gt;'s voice to develop it, &lt;a href=\"Vocaloid\"&gt;Vocaloid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hatsune%20Miku\"&gt;Hatsune Miku&lt;/a&gt; was released, and many songs featuring Hatsune Miku were shown on the &lt;a href=\"Nico%20Nico%20Douga\"&gt;Nico Nico Douga&lt;/a&gt;.

The albums \"Re: Package\" and \"Supercell\" were not brought under the control of the &lt;a href=\"copyright\"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt; system of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Society%20for%20Rights%20of%20Authors%2C%20Composers%20and%20Publishers\"&gt;Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers&lt;/a&gt; (JASRAC), breaking the tradition that the musicians under the major labels affiliated with the system.\nIn June 2009, voice actress &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Mizuki\"&gt;Nana Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;'s album \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Diamond\"&gt;Ultimate Diamond&lt;/a&gt;\" became the first voice actor album to reach number one on the Oricon weekly charts.
