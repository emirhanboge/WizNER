    "text": "The 2016 Uhrencup was a summer &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Matches were played in &lt;a href=\"Grenchen\"&gt;Grenchen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Biel/Bienne\"&gt;Biel&lt;/a&gt;. Swiss clubs &lt;a href=\"BSC%20Young%20Boys\"&gt;Young Boys&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Challenge%20League\"&gt;Challenge League&lt;/a&gt;) were joined by &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&lt;/a&gt; (Germany) and &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Galatasaray&lt;/a&gt; (Turkey). It was the 52nd edition of the &lt;a href=\"Uhrencup\"&gt;Uhrencup&lt;/a&gt;, but the first since 2013.\nOverview.\nStandings.\nThe tournament consisted of four matches, with three points given for a win, two for a penalty shoot-out win, one for a penalty shoot-out loss or a draw, and zero for a loss. A &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine the winners if tied after 90 minutes. However, after the final match between Galatasaray and Young Boys finished as a 1\u20131 draw, Galatasaray mathematically became champions, therefore no penalty shoot-out took place.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"
