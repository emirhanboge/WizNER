    "text": "Voskresenskiy is a &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20craters\"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"impact%20crater\"&gt;impact crater&lt;/a&gt; that is located near the western limb of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its position, this crater is viewed edge-on, limiting the amount of detail that can be viewed. The visibility of this formation is also affected by &lt;a href=\"libration\"&gt;libration&lt;/a&gt;, so that at times this crater is hidden from sight, while at other times it can be more readily viewed.\nThe crater is located to the southeast of the walled plains &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B6ntgen%20%28crater%29\"&gt;R\u00f6ntgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorentz%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Lorentz&lt;/a&gt;. To the south-southwest lies the crater &lt;a href=\"Bartels%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Bartels&lt;/a&gt;, and slightly farther to the east is the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Oceanus%20Procellarum\"&gt;Oceanus Procellarum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outer edge of this crater is only slightly worn, and the edge is still well-defined with only a few tiny craterlets lying along the southwestern rim. A small crater is attached to the exterior edge of the rim to the southeast. The inner wall has a shelf or &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Aterrace\"&gt;terrace&lt;/a&gt; along the northern and western sides. The dark interior floor has been resurfaced by &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and it has the same low albedo as the lunar mare to the east.\nSatellite craters.\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Voskresenskiy."
