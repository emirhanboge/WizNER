He was the brother of poet &lt;a href=\"Petr%20K%C5%99i%C4%8Dka\"&gt;Petr K\u0159i\u010dka&lt;/a&gt;].\nLife.\nJaroslav K\u0159i\u010dka was born into the family of the Kel\u010d village cantor and headmaster Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u010dka (1848\u20131891) as the oldest of three siblings. His mother was Franti\u0161ka K\u0159i\u010dkov\u00e1 (1861-1936). His brother Petr K\u0159i\u010dka (1884\u20131949) later became a well-known poet, and his sister Pavla K\u0159i\u010dkov\u00e1 (1886\u20131972) became a writer. Their father enthusiastically supported the musical education of his children; Jaroslav received violin, piano, and voice lessons as a child.\nHe attended high school in &lt;a href=\"Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv%20Brod\"&gt;Havl\u00ed\u010dk\u016fv Brod&lt;/a&gt; and graduated in 1900. As a high school student, he founded his own vocal quartet, &lt;a href=\"string%20quartet\"&gt;string quartet&lt;/a&gt;, and student orchestra and began to compose. After graduating from high school, he moved to Prague and studied at the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Conservatory\"&gt;Prague Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; from 1902 to 1905. Under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Kli%C4%8Dka\"&gt;Josef Klicka&lt;/a&gt;, he studied &lt;a href=\"Organ%20%28music%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orchestration\"&gt;orchestration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"harmony\"&gt;harmony&lt;/a&gt;. He studied conducting with &lt;a href=\"Karel%20Knittl\"&gt;Karel Knittl&lt;/a&gt;] and composition with Karel Stecker]. His musical role models were the famous Czech composers &lt;a href=\"Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k\"&gt;Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana\"&gt;Bed\u0159ich Smetana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20Fibich\"&gt;Zden\u011bk Fibich&lt;/a&gt;, and later also the Czech &lt;a href=\"Modernism%20%28music%29\"&gt;modernists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADt%C4%9Bzslav%20Nov%C3%A1k\"&gt;V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Suk%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Josef Suk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter studying for a year in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (1905\u20131906), he moved to &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; for three years (1906\u20131909) and taught &lt;a href=\"music%20theory\"&gt;music theory&lt;/a&gt;, harmony, and &lt;a href=\"chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber music&lt;/a&gt; at the Imperial Music School in &lt;a href=\"Dnipro\"&gt;Ekaterinoslav&lt;/a&gt;. There he founded an orchestra with which he performed works by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Bed\u0159ich Smetana. In Russia, he developed friendships with the composers &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Glazunov\"&gt;Alexander Glazunov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Taneyev\"&gt;Sergei Tanejev&lt;/a&gt;.

It was in Ekaterinoslav that he penned one of his most famous songs, \"Albatross,\" from the cycle \"Severn\u00ed noci\" \"(Northern Nights)\". Mussorgsky's song cycles for children also inspired him to compose his own children's songs.\nK\u0159i\u010dka moved to Prague in 1909, and from 1911 to 1920 he directed the Prague choir Hlahol]. His tenure as director afforded him the opportunity to study numerous works by contemporary Czech composers such as &lt;a href=\"Leo%C5%A1%20Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k, and &lt;a href=\"Otakar%20Jeremi%C3%A1%C5%A1\"&gt;Otakar Jeremi\u00e1\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to premiering Nov\u00e1k's cantata \"Svatebn\u00ed ko\u0161ile (The Wedding Shirt)\", Op.48.
