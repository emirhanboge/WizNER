    "text": "Looney Tunes Cartoons is an American &lt;a href=\"Animated%20series\"&gt;animated television series&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Browngardt\"&gt;Peter Browngardt&lt;/a&gt; and produced by &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Animation\"&gt;Warner Bros. Animation&lt;/a&gt;, based on the characters from \"&lt;a href=\"Looney%20Tunes\"&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Merrie%20Melodies\"&gt;Merrie Melodies&lt;/a&gt;\". The series made its worldwide debut at the &lt;a href=\"Annecy%20International%20Animated%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Annecy International Animated Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; on June 10, 2019, and premiered on &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Max\"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on May 27, 2020.\nProduction.\nIn 2017, after Browngardt finished \"&lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Grandpa\"&gt;Uncle Grandpa&lt;/a&gt;\", he met with Audrey Diehl, the creative executive at Warner Bros., at a lunch meeting. They discussed a project in which he was not interested, and as they wrapped up lunch, Pete said, \"You know, what I really want to do is to direct a \"Looney Tunes\" short\". She was surprised that he was a fan of \"Looney Tunes\" and booked him a meeting with studio president, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Register\"&gt;Sam Register&lt;/a&gt;. Browngardt expressed that he wanted to direct it in the spirit of the classic 1940s cartoons. He then began casting, hiring Eric Bauza, and as an admirer of Jim Soper's art on &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, hired him as a character designer.\n&lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Animation\"&gt;Warner Bros. Animation&lt;/a&gt; announced a new series in June 2018, to \"consist of 1,000 minutes spread across 1\u20136 minute shorts each season\" (despite that claim being retconned via splitting those minutes into more seasons), be released in 2019 and featuring \"the brand's marquee characters voiced by their current voice actors in simple gag-driven and visually vibrant stories\". The style of the series is reminiscent of the classic \"Looney Tunes\" shorts made by &lt;a href=\"Tex%20Avery\"&gt;Tex Avery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Clampett\"&gt;Bob Clampett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Jones\"&gt;Chuck Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Friz%20Freleng\"&gt;Friz Freleng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20McKimson\"&gt;Robert McKimson&lt;/a&gt; and others. Register and Browngardt serve as executive producers for the series. The characters are designed by Jim Soper, with the model sheets copyright dating back to 2018. The initial designs for \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\" were previewed in the Warner Bros. Animation logo that was first shown before \"&lt;a href=\"Teen%20Titans%20Go%21%20To%20the%20Movies\"&gt;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&lt;/a&gt;\". The animation was directed by Joey Capps, who also did animation work on &lt;a href=\"Adult%20Swim\"&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Superjail%21\"&gt;Superjail!&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe series brings all of the \"Looney Tunes\" together under one roof, having already reintroduced &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20Bunny\"&gt;Bugs Bunny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daffy%20Duck\"&gt;Daffy Duck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tweety\"&gt;Tweety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvester%20the%20Cat\"&gt;Sylvester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porky%20Pig\"&gt;Porky Pig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Hare\"&gt;The Gremlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elmer%20Fudd\"&gt;Elmer Fudd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bugs\"&gt;The Gashouse Gorillas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yosemite%20Sam\"&gt;Yosemite Sam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Granny%20%28Looney%20Tunes%29\"&gt;Granny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Daffy%20Doc\"&gt;Doctor Quack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beaky%20Buzzard\"&gt;Beaky Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20Bunny%20Gets%20the%20Boid\"&gt;Mama Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20Runner\"&gt;Road Runner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wile%20E.%20Coyote\"&gt;Wile E.

Film reviewing site Oneofus.net noted: \"While only time will tell if these shorts will become classics, they decidedly will be seen as a noble attempt to bring the \"Looney\" back into \"Looney Tunes\".
