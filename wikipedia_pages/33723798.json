    "text": "Persoonia prostrata is a plant in the family &lt;a href=\"Proteaceae\"&gt;Proteaceae&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the northern tip of &lt;a href=\"K%27gari%20%28Fraser%20Island%29\"&gt;K'gari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, but is presumed to be extinct. It is similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Persoonia%20stradbrokensis\"&gt;Persoonia stradbrokensis&lt;/a&gt;\" but is a &lt;a href=\"prostrate%20shrub\"&gt;prostrate shrub&lt;/a&gt; with smaller leaves and flowers.\nDescription.\n\"Persoonia prostrata\" is a prostrate shrub with elliptic to spatula-shaped leaves long and wide. The flowers are arranged along a &lt;a href=\"Rachis%23In%20botany\"&gt;rachis&lt;/a&gt; up to long, that continues to grow after flowering, each flower with a scale leaf at its base. The &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s are about long. The species is only known from two collections and may be of a prostrate form of \"&lt;a href=\"Persoonia%20stradbrokensis\"&gt;P. stradbrokensis&lt;/a&gt;\", although that species has not been found on K'gari.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Persoonia prostrata\" was first formally described in 1810 by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29\"&gt;Robert Brown&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Linnean%20Society%20of%20London%23Publications\"&gt;Transactions of the Linnean Society of London&lt;/a&gt;\" from specimens he collected near the coast of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Cape\"&gt;Sandy Cape&lt;/a&gt; in 1802.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThis geebung is only known from the Brown's &lt;a href=\"Type%20%28biology%29\"&gt;type&lt;/a&gt; collection and another collected near the end of the 19th century, both from Sandy Cape on K'gari, where it grew on &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"heath\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nConservation status.\n\"Persoonia prostrata\" is classified as \"extinct\" under the Australian Government \"&lt;a href=\"Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999\"&gt;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Queensland Government \"&lt;a href=\"Nature%20Conservation%20Act%201992\"&gt;Nature Conservation Act 1992&lt;/a&gt;\"."
