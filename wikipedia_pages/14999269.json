    "text": "Shedd is an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20area\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"census-designated%20place\"&gt;census-designated place&lt;/a&gt; (CDP) in &lt;a href=\"Linn%20County%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Linn County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, United States, on &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Route%2099E\"&gt;Oregon Route 99E&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt; it had a population of 204.\nHistory.\nIn 1858, a community and &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;gristmill&lt;/a&gt; was established about a mile and a half east of the present town of Shedd and called \"Boston\", probably because one of the founders came from &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. Boston was &lt;a href=\"plat\"&gt;plat&lt;/a&gt;ted in 1861 with a &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;-style &lt;a href=\"town%20square\"&gt;town square&lt;/a&gt;. The town became a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; stop, and \"Boston Mills\" post office was established in 1869. Efforts to get the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20and%20California%20Railroad\"&gt;Oregon and California Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, which was being built south from &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, to come through Boston Mills were unsuccessful. The railroad was instead built through the nearby land donated by Civil War veteran Captain Frank Shedd, and \"Shedd's Station\" was created in 1871. The post office was moved soon after. Many of Boston's buildings, though not the mill itself nor the Farwell DLC homestead, were moved west to the new Shedd's Station to be near the railroad. In 1899, the railroad changed the name of the station to \"Shedd\", but the name of the post office did not change until 1915.\nEast of Shedd at the former site of Boston Mills, on the &lt;a href=\"Calapooia%20River\"&gt;Calapooia River&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;-listed &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Flour%20Mill\"&gt;Boston Flour Mill&lt;/a&gt; (aka Thompson's Flouring Mill), Oregon's oldest continuously operating water-powered mill, part of &lt;a href=\"Thompson%27s%20Mills%20State%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;Thompson's Mills State Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the four remaining gristmills in the state, and one of only two mills still in operation.\nGeography.\nShedd is in western Linn County in the &lt;a href=\"Willamette%20River\"&gt;Willamette River&lt;/a&gt; valley, with Shedd Slough, a tributary of the Calapooia River, flowing northwards on the east side of town. &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Route%2099E\"&gt;Oregon Route 99E&lt;/a&gt; passes through the center of town, leading north to &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; and south to &lt;a href=\"Halsey%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Halsey&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the Shedd CDP has an area of , all of it recorded as land."
