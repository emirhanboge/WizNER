    "text": "The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Kingdom of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, now in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. A French army under the command of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by two of the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Coalition\"&gt;Seventh Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, a British-led coalition consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussian&lt;/a&gt; army under the command of Field Marshal &lt;a href=\"Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher\"&gt;von Bl\u00fccher&lt;/a&gt;, referred to also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was contemporaneously known as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean (France) or La Belle Alliance (the beautiful alliance - Prussia).\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were &lt;a href=\"canton%20%28military%29\"&gt;cantoned&lt;/a&gt; close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to &lt;a href=\"Defeat%20in%20detail\"&gt;attack them separately&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ligny\"&gt;Battle of Ligny&lt;/a&gt; with his main force, causing the Prussians to withdraw northwards on 17 June, but parallel to Wellington and in good order.\nNapoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Wavre\"&gt;Battle of Wavre&lt;/a&gt; with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras\"&gt;Battle of Quatre Bras&lt;/a&gt; with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to withdraw north to Waterloo on 17 June.\nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the &lt;a href=\"Mont-Saint-Jean%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Mont-Saint-Jean&lt;/a&gt; escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;French Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20Campaign\"&gt;Waterloo Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\". &lt;a href=\"Abdication%20of%20Napoleon%2C%201815\"&gt;Napoleon abdicated&lt;/a&gt; four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20the%20French\"&gt;Emperor of the French&lt;/a&gt; and marked the end of his &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Days\"&gt;Hundred Days&lt;/a&gt; return from exile. This ended the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt; and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of &lt;a href=\"International%20relations%20of%20the%20Great%20Powers%20%281814%E2%80%931919%29\"&gt;relative peace&lt;/a&gt;, often referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Pax%20Britannica\"&gt;Pax Britannica&lt;/a&gt;\". The battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Braine-l%27Alleud\"&gt;Braine-l'Alleud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lasne\"&gt;Lasne&lt;/a&gt;, about south of &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, and about from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Mound\"&gt;Lion's Mound&lt;/a&gt;, a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\nPrelude.\nOn 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; . Four days later, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon. Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Coalition\"&gt;Seventh Coalition&lt;/a&gt; from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised.\nHad Napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might have been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20War\"&gt;Peninsular War&lt;/a&gt; had been sent to North America to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe initial dispositions of British commander &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through &lt;a href=\"Mons\"&gt;Mons&lt;/a&gt; to the south-west of Brussels. This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by &lt;a href=\"Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher\"&gt;Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher&lt;/a&gt;, but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at &lt;a href=\"Ostend\"&gt;Ostend&lt;/a&gt;. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers. Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Ney\"&gt;Marshal Ney&lt;/a&gt;, a right wing commanded by &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%2C%20marquis%20de%20Grouchy\"&gt;Marshal Grouchy&lt;/a&gt; and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; before dawn on 15 June, the French , securing Napoleon's \"central position\" between Wellington's and Bl\u00fccher's armies. He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's.\nOnly very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20of%20Richmond%27s%20ball\"&gt;Duchess of Richmond's ball&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the &lt;a href=\"William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Prince of Orange&lt;/a&gt; and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on &lt;a href=\"Quatre%20Bras\"&gt;Quatre Bras&lt;/a&gt;, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of &lt;a href=\"Bernhard%20Carl%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\"&gt;Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar&lt;/a&gt;, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras\"&gt;Quatre Bras&lt;/a&gt; lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.\nMeanwhile, on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ligny\"&gt;Battle of Ligny&lt;/a&gt; using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Freiherr%20von%20B%C3%BClow\"&gt;B\u00fclow&lt;/a&gt;'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of &lt;a href=\"Wavre\"&gt;Wavre&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable. The next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnoitred&lt;/a&gt; the previous year\u2014the low &lt;a href=\"ridge\"&gt;ridge&lt;/a&gt; of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sonian%20Forest\"&gt;Sonian Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nNapoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry &lt;a href=\"action%20at%20Genappe\"&gt;action at Genappe&lt;/a&gt;, there was no substantial engagement.\nBefore leaving Ligny, Napoleon had ordered Grouchy, who commanded the right wing, to with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy.\nAs 17 June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Bl\u00fccher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around to the east of the town. Early on the morning of the 18th, Wellington received an assurance from Bl\u00fccher that the Prussian army would support him. He decided to hold his ground and give battle.\nArmies.\nThree armies participated in the battle: Napoleon's \"Arm\u00e9e du Nord\", a multinational army under Wellington, and a Prussian army under Bl\u00fccher.\nThe French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns. Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured &lt;a href=\"heavy%20cavalry\"&gt;heavy cavalry&lt;/a&gt;, and seven of highly versatile &lt;a href=\"lancers\"&gt;lancers&lt;/a&gt; who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.\nHowever, as the army took shape, French officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.\nThe French army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.\nWellington later said that he had \"an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced &lt;a href=\"Staff%20%28military%29\"&gt;Staff&lt;/a&gt;\". His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20German%20Legion\"&gt;King's German Legion&lt;/a&gt; (KGL). All of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans. In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, 6,000 from &lt;a href=\"Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg%23Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel\"&gt;Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;, and 3,000 from &lt;a href=\"Nassau%20%28duchy%29\"&gt;Nassau&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced. The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Barbero\"&gt;Alessandro Barbero&lt;/a&gt; states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany\"&gt;Duke of York&lt;/a&gt; imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Paget%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Anglesey\"&gt;Earl of Uxbridge&lt;/a&gt;. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had &lt;a href=\"Blank%20cheque\"&gt;carte blanche&lt;/a&gt; from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at &lt;a href=\"Halle%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Halle&lt;/a&gt;, away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Frederick%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Prince Frederick of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and \"Freikorps\" volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many \"&lt;a href=\"Landwehr\"&gt;Landwehr&lt;/a&gt;\" (militia) regiments. The \"Landwehr\" were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its &lt;a href=\"German%20General%20Staff\"&gt;General Staff&lt;/a&gt; organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours. Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Mouton\"&gt;Lobau&lt;/a&gt; at 16:30, while &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Ernst%20Karl%2C%20Graf%20von%20Zieten\"&gt;Zieten&lt;/a&gt;'s I Corps and parts of &lt;a href=\"Pirch%20I\"&gt;Pirch I&lt;/a&gt;'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.\nBattlefield.\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the &lt;a href=\"Ohain%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Ohain&lt;/a&gt; road, a deep &lt;a href=\"sunken%20lane\"&gt;sunken lane&lt;/a&gt;. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20Elm\"&gt;a large elm tree&lt;/a&gt; that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Reverse%20slope%20defence\"&gt;reverse slope&lt;/a&gt;, as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his &lt;a href=\"skirmisher\"&gt;skirmisher&lt;/a&gt;s and artillery. The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at . This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of &lt;a href=\"Braine-l%27Alleud\"&gt;Braine-l'Alleud&lt;/a&gt;, in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of &lt;a href=\"Hougoumont%20%28farmhouse%29\"&gt;Hougoumont&lt;/a&gt;. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Papelotte\"&gt;Papelotte&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's &lt;a href=\"Flanking%20maneuver\"&gt;flanks&lt;/a&gt; securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of &lt;a href=\"La%20Haye%20Sainte\"&gt;La Haye Sainte&lt;/a&gt;, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion. On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the &lt;a href=\"95th%20Rifles\"&gt;95th Rifles&lt;/a&gt; were posted as sharpshooters.\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between &lt;a href=\"Enfilade%20and%20defilade\"&gt;enfilading fire&lt;/a&gt; from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Waterloo%20Battlefield%20locations%23Eastern%20end%20of%20the%20line%20of%20battle\"&gt;other garrisoned buildings&lt;/a&gt; on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain &lt;a href=\"defile%20%28geography%29\"&gt;defile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Drouet%2C%20Comte%20d%27Erlon\"&gt;d'Erlon&lt;/a&gt; with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under &lt;a href=\"Honor%C3%A9%20Charles%20Reille\"&gt;Reille&lt;/a&gt; with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Belle%20Alliance\"&gt;La Belle Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\" were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of &lt;a href=\"Plancenoit\"&gt;Plancenoit&lt;/a&gt;, and at the extreme right, the \"Bois de Paris\" wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near \"La Belle Alliance\" early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.\nBattle.\nPreparation.\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, &lt;a href=\"August%20Neidhardt%20von%20Gneisenau\"&gt;August Neidhardt von Gneisenau&lt;/a&gt;, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow.\nThe roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88\u00a0artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at \"Le Caillou\", the house where he had spent the night. When &lt;a href=\"Jean-de-Dieu%20Soult\"&gt;Soult&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.\nLater on, being told by his brother, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt;, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at \"Le Caillou\" had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had &lt;a href=\"bivouac%20shelter\"&gt;bivouacked&lt;/a&gt; well to the south of \"La Belle Alliance\". At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Battery\"&gt;grande batterie&lt;/a&gt;\" of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.\nHougoumont.\nHistorian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\". Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\". Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30. The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of &lt;a href=\"Foot%20guards\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt;, and the wood and park by Hanoverian \"&lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29\"&gt;J\u00e4ger&lt;/a&gt;\" and the 1/2nd Nassau.\nThe initial attack by Bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard. The &lt;a href=\"Coldstream%20Guards\"&gt;Coldstream Guards&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scots%20Guards\"&gt;Scots Guards&lt;/a&gt; arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the &lt;a href=\"71st%20%28Highland%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;71st Highlanders&lt;/a&gt;, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Halkett\"&gt;Hugh Halkett&lt;/a&gt;'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\nThe fighting at Hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead. In fact there is a good case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33\u00a0battalions in all, 14,000\u00a0troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21\u00a0battalions (12,000\u00a0troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".\nThe Grand Battery starts its bombardment.\nThe 80 guns of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Battery\"&gt;Napoleon's \"grande batterie\"&lt;/a&gt; drew up in the centre. These opened fire at 11:50, according to &lt;a href=\"Rowland%20Hill%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hill\"&gt;Lord Hill&lt;/a&gt; (commander of the Anglo-allied II Corps), while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30. The \"grande batterie\" was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of Kempt and Pack, and &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20George%20de%20Perponcher%20Sedlnitsky\"&gt;Perponcher&lt;/a&gt;'s 2nd Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic \"reverse slope defence\").\nThe bombardment caused a large number of casualties. Although some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, to reduce their casualty rate.\nNapoleon spots the Prussians.\nAt about 13:15, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of &lt;a href=\"Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert\"&gt;Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert&lt;/a&gt;, away from his right flank\u2014about three hours march for an army. Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians. Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians \"with your sword against his back\" towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo.\nGrouchy was advised by his subordinate, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89tienne%20Maurice%20G%C3%A9rard\"&gt;G\u00e9rard&lt;/a&gt;, to \"march to the sound of the guns\", but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant-General\"&gt;Lieutenant-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baron\"&gt;Baron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Johann%20von%20Thielmann\"&gt;Johann von Thielmann&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Wavre\"&gt;Battle of Wavre&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack B\u00fclow would not actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00.\nFirst French infantry attack.\nA little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began in large &lt;a href=\"column%20%28formation%29\"&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt;. Bernard Cornwell writes \"[column] suggests an elongated formation with its narrow end aimed like a spear at the enemy line, while in truth it was much more like a brick advancing sideways and d'Erlon's assault was made up of four such bricks, each one a division of French infantry\". Each division, with one exception, was drawn up in huge masses, consisting of the eight or nine battalions of which they were formed, deployed, and placed in a column one behind the other, with only five paces interval between the battalions.\nThe one exception was the 1st Division (Commanded by &lt;a href=\"Joachim%20J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Quiot%20du%20Passage\"&gt;Quiot&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the 1st Brigade). Its two brigades were formed in a similar manner, but side by side instead of behind one another. This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other (&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Charles-Francois%20Bourgeois\"&gt;Bourgeois&lt;/a&gt;') was to attack the eastern side of the same post.\nThe divisions were to advance in &lt;a href=\"echelon%20%28formation%29\"&gt;echelon&lt;/a&gt; from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart\u2014the 2nd Division (&lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois-Xavier%20Donzelot\"&gt;Donzelot&lt;/a&gt;'s) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division (&lt;a href=\"Pierre-Louis%20Binet%20de%20Marcognet\"&gt;Marcognet&lt;/a&gt;'s) next, and the 4th Division (&lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Joseph%20Durutte\"&gt;Durutte&lt;/a&gt;'s) on the right. They were led by Ney to the assault, each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred &lt;a href=\"File%20%28formation%29\"&gt;files&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leftmost division advanced on the walled farmhouse compound &lt;a href=\"La%20Haye%20Sainte\"&gt;La Haye Sainte&lt;/a&gt;. The farmhouse was defended by the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20German%20Legion\"&gt;King's German Legion&lt;/a&gt;. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of &lt;a href=\"cuirassiers\"&gt;cuirassiers&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The &lt;a href=\"William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Prince of Orange&lt;/a&gt; saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000\u00a0men over a front of about , against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000\u00a0men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"&lt;a href=\"Brigade%20van%20Bylandt\"&gt;Brigade van Bylandt&lt;/a&gt;\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Picton\"&gt;Sir Thomas Picton&lt;/a&gt;, who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bylandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.\nAt the moment these skirmishers were rejoining their parent battalions, the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire. On the left of the brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a \"few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred\". The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap. D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the command of Colonel &lt;a href=\"Pieter%20Hendrik%20van%20Zuylen%20van%20Nijevelt\"&gt;Van Zuylen van Nijevelt&lt;/a&gt;. A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later. Bylandt was wounded and retired off the field, passing command of the brigade to Lt. Kol. De Jongh.\nD'Erlon's men ascended the slope and advanced on the sunken road, \"Chemin d'Ohain\", that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with &lt;a href=\"Willem%20Frederik%20van%20Bylandt\"&gt;Bylandt&lt;/a&gt;'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade.\nOn the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the \"45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne\" and followed by the \"25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne\", somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the \"21e\" and \"45e\" regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Pack\"&gt;Pack&lt;/a&gt;'s 9th Brigade consisting of the &lt;a href=\"44th%20Foot\"&gt;44th Foot&lt;/a&gt; and three Scottish regiments: the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Scots\"&gt;Royal Scots&lt;/a&gt;, the 42nd &lt;a href=\"Black%20Watch\"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.\nPack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French \"45e Ligne\" burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.\nReports from &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Freiherr%20von%20M%C3%BCffling\"&gt;Baron von M\u00fcffling&lt;/a&gt;, the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".\nCharge of the British heavy cavalry.\nAt this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry\u2014formed unseen behind the ridge\u2014to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry. The &lt;a href=\"1st%20Cavalry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Household Brigade, commanded by Major-General &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Edward%20Somerset\"&gt;Lord Edward Somerset&lt;/a&gt;, consisted of guards regiments: the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Regiment%20of%20Life%20Guards\"&gt;1st&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Regiment%20of%20Life%20Guards\"&gt;2nd Life Guards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horse%20Guards\"&gt;Royal Horse Guards&lt;/a&gt; (the Blues), and the &lt;a href=\"1st%20King%27s%20Dragoon%20Guards\"&gt;1st (King's) Dragoon Guards&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Cavalry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;2nd Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General &lt;a href=\"William%20Ponsonby%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Sir William Ponsonby&lt;/a&gt;, was so called as it consisted of an English (the &lt;a href=\"1st%20The%20Royal%20Dragoons\"&gt;1st or The Royals&lt;/a&gt;), a Scottish (&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Scots%20Greys\"&gt;2nd Scots Greys&lt;/a&gt;), and an Irish (&lt;a href=\"6th%20%28Inniskilling%29%20Dragoons\"&gt;6th or Inniskilling&lt;/a&gt;) regiment of heavy dragoons.\nMore than 20\u00a0years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm. British cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, were cavalier in attitude, and, unlike the infantry, some units had scant experience of warfare.\nThe Scots Greys, for example, had not been in action since 1795. According to Wellington, though they were superior individual horsemen, they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability. \"I considered one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers.\"\nThe two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve. There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, the morning of the battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to \"support movements to their front\". It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Ormsby%20Vandeleur\"&gt;Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hussey%20Vivian%2C%201st%20Baron%20Vivian\"&gt;Hussey Vivian&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies. Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying \"I committed a great mistake\", when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support.\nThe Household Brigade crossed the crest of the Anglo-allied position and charged downhill. The cuirassiers guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.\nContinuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade &lt;a href=\"infantry%20square\"&gt;formed in squares&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo their left, the Union Brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend that some of the &lt;a href=\"92nd%20%28Gordon%20Highlanders%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;92nd Gordon Highland Regiment&lt;/a&gt; clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge. From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the \"105e Ligne\". The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, \"45e \"Ligne\", as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the \"45e \"Ligne\" and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade. These would be the only two &lt;a href=\"French%20Imperial%20Eagle\"&gt;French eagles&lt;/a&gt; captured by the British during the battle. On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.\nAs with the Household Cavalry, the officers of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery. Although the Greys had neither the time nor means to disable the cannon or carry them off, they put very many out of action as the gun crews were killed or fled the battlefield. Sergeant Major Dickinson of the Greys stated that his regiment was rallied before going on to attack the French artillery: Hamilton, the regimental commander, rather than holding them back cried out to his men \"Charge, charge the guns!\"\nNapoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two &lt;a href=\"Chevau-l%C3%A9ger\"&gt;Chevau-l\u00e9ger&lt;/a&gt; (lancer) regiments in the I Corps &lt;a href=\"light%20cavalry\"&gt;light cavalry&lt;/a&gt; division. Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys and the rest of the British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Jean%20Baptiste%20Milhaud\"&gt;Milhaud&lt;/a&gt;'s cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.\nAs Ponsonby tried to rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was attacked by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. The French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue.\nBy the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry. A countercharge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch\u2013Belgian light dragoons and &lt;a href=\"hussar\"&gt;hussar&lt;/a&gt;s under Major-General &lt;a href=\"Charles%20%C3%89tienne%20de%20Ghigny\"&gt;Ghigny&lt;/a&gt; on the left wing, and Dutch\u2013Belgian \"&lt;a href=\"carabinier\"&gt;carabinier&lt;/a&gt;s\" under Major-General &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Dominicus%20Trip%20van%20Zoudtlandt\"&gt;Trip&lt;/a&gt; in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.\nAll figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates, as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest.\nThe Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.\nSome historians, such as Chandler, Weller, Uffindell, and Corum, assert that the British heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Greys were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades).\nThis service was rendered at a very high cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry, and\u2014more deadly than all of these\u2014artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only three squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process. At the end of the fighting, the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.\nFourteen thousand French troops of d'Erlon's I Corps had been committed to this attack. The I Corps had been driven in rout back across the valley costing Napoleon 3,000 casualties including over 2,000\u00a0prisoners taken. Also some valuable time was lost, as the charge had dispersed numerous units and it would take until 16:00 for d'Erlon's shaken corps to reform. And although elements of the Prussians now began to appear on the field to his right, Napoleon had already ordered Lobau's VI corps to move to the right flank to hold them back before d'Erlon's attack began.\nThe French cavalry attack.\nA little before 16:00, Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.\nInitially, Milhaud's reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lefebvre-Desnouettes\"&gt;Lefebvre-Desno\u00ebttes&lt;/a&gt;' light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800\u00a0sabres, were committed. When these were repulsed, &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20%C3%89tienne%20de%20Kellermann\"&gt;Kellermann&lt;/a&gt;'s heavy cavalry corps and &lt;a href=\"Claude-%C3%89tienne%20Guyot\"&gt;Guyot&lt;/a&gt;'s heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000\u00a0cavalry in 67\u00a0squadrons. When Napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon.\nWellington's infantry responded by forming squares (hollow box-formations four ranks deep). Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than in length on a side. &lt;a href=\"Infantry%20square\"&gt;Infantry square&lt;/a&gt;s that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12\u00a0assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite \"carabinier\" brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.\nA British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge.\nIf infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry.\nAt least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. &lt;a href=\"Cavali%C3%A9%20Mercer\"&gt;Captain Mercer&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded &lt;a href=\"G%20Parachute%20Battery%20%28Mercer%27s%20Troop%29%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery\"&gt;'G' Troop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horse%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Horse Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.\nFor reasons that remain unclear, no attempt was made to &lt;a href=\"Touch%20hole\"&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; other Anglo-allied guns while they were in French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent.\nTheir casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed\u2014testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front. Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the \"Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval\" numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period. Overall, Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47% of its strength.\nSecond French infantry attack.\nEventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500\u00a0infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.\nUxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Dominicus%20Trip%20van%20Zoudtlandt\"&gt;Trip&lt;/a&gt;, to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him. Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence. However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources. Meanwhile, Bachelu's and Tissot's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by fire from artillery and from Adam's infantry brigade, and they eventually fell back.\nAlthough the French cavalry caused few direct casualties to Wellington's centre, artillery fire onto his infantry squares caused many. Wellington's cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, and had taken significant losses. The situation appeared so desperate that the Cumberland Hussars, the only Hanoverian cavalry regiment present, fled the field spreading alarm all the way to Brussels.\nFrench capture of La Haye Sainte.\nAt approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th \"L\u00e9g\u00e8re,\" renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.\nWith La Haye Sainte captured, Ney then moved skirmishers and &lt;a href=\"horse%20artillery\"&gt;horse artillery&lt;/a&gt; up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with &lt;a href=\"canister%20shot\"&gt;canister&lt;/a&gt;. The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square.\nThe success Napoleon needed to continue his offensive had occurred. Ney was on the verge of breaking the Anglo-allied centre.\nAlong with this artillery fire a multitude of French \"tirailleurs\" occupied the dominant positions behind La Haye Sainte and poured an effective fire into the squares. The situation for the Anglo-allies was now so dire that the 33rd Regiment's colours and all of Halkett's brigade's colours were sent to the rear for safety, described by historian Alessandro Barbero as, \"...\u00a0a measure that was without precedent\".\nWellington, noticing the slackening of fire from La Haye Sainte, with his staff rode closer to it. French skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the British command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road. The Prince of Orange then ordered a single battalion of the KGL, the Fifth, to recapture the farm despite the obvious presence of enemy cavalry. Their Colonel, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Ompteda\"&gt;Christian Friedrich Wilhelm von Ompteda&lt;/a&gt; obeyed and led the battalion down the slope, chasing off some French skirmishers until French cuirassiers fell on his open flank, killed him, destroyed his battalion and took its colour.\nA Dutch\u2013Belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge retreated from the field instead, fired on by their own infantry. Merlen's Light Cavalry Brigade charged the French artillery taking position near La Haye Sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart. The Netherlands Cavalry Division, Wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the centre having lost half their strength was now useless and the French cavalry, despite its losses, were masters of the field, compelling the Anglo-allied infantry to remain in square. More and more French artillery was brought forward.\nA French battery advanced to within 300 yards of the 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers. Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, \"The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appalling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped\".\nFrench \"tirailleurs\" occupied the dominant positions, especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry because of the presence of French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the \"tirailleurs\". That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.\nDuring this time many of Wellington's generals and aides were killed or wounded including &lt;a href=\"FitzRoy%20Somerset%2C%201st%20Baron%20Raglan\"&gt;FitzRoy Somerset&lt;/a&gt;, Canning, &lt;a href=\"William%20Howe%20De%20Lancey\"&gt;de Lancey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Count%20Alten\"&gt;Alten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Cooke%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Cooke&lt;/a&gt;. The situation was now critical and Wellington, trapped in an infantry square and ignorant of events beyond it, was desperate for the arrival of help from the Prussians. He later wrote, \nArrival of the Prussian IV Corps: Plancenoit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20battle%20of%20the%20Waterloo%20campaign%23Prussian%20IV%20Corps\"&gt;Prussian IV Corps&lt;/a&gt; (B\u00fclow's) was the first to arrive in strength. B\u00fclow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions. Bl\u00fccher intended to secure his right upon the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teaux%20Frichermont\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teaux Frichermont&lt;/a&gt; using the Bois de Paris road. Bl\u00fccher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General B\u00fclow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.\nAt about this time, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20battle%20of%20the%20Waterloo%20campaign%23Prussian%2015th%20Brigade\"&gt;Prussian 15th Brigade&lt;/a&gt; () was sent to link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-&lt;a href=\"La%20Haye%2C%20Lasne\"&gt;La Haie&lt;/a&gt; area, with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of B\u00fclow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past the rear of the \"Armee Du Nord's\" right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.\nNapoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed. The Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out. Napoleon sent two battalions of the Middle/Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting\u2014they did not deign to fire their muskets\u2014this force recaptured the village.\nZieten's flank march.\nThroughout the late afternoon, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20battle%20of%20the%20Waterloo%20campaign%23Prussian%20I%20Corps\"&gt;Prussian I Corps&lt;/a&gt; (Zieten's) had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of La Haie. General &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Freiherr%20von%20M%C3%BCffling\"&gt;M\u00fcffling&lt;/a&gt;, the Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet Zieten.\nZieten had by this time brought up the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20battle%20of%20the%20Waterloo%20campaign%23Prussian%201st%20Brigade\"&gt;Prussian 1st Brigade&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Karl%20Friedrich%20Franciscus%20von%20Steinmetz\"&gt;Steinmetz&lt;/a&gt;'s), but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade (Laurens'). These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Bl\u00fccher to support B\u00fclow, which Zieten obeyed, starting to march to B\u00fclow's aid.\nM\u00fcffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank. M\u00fcffling warned Zieten that \"The battle is lost if the corps does not keep on the move and immediately support the English army.\" Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.\nThe French were expecting Grouchy to march to their support from Wavre, and when Prussian I Corps (Zieten's) appeared at Waterloo instead of Grouchy, \"the shock of disillusionment shattered French morale\" and \"the sight of Zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in Napoleon's army\". I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30 the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape. The ends of the line were now based on Hougoumont on the left, Plancenoit on the right, and the centre on La Haie.\nDurutte had taken the positions of La Haie and Papelotte in a series of attacks, but now retreated behind Smohain without opposing the Prussian 24th Regiment (Laurens') as it retook both. The 24th advanced against the new French position, was repulsed, and returned to the attack supported by Silesian \"Sch\u00fctzen\" (riflemen) and the F/1st \"Landwehr\". The French initially fell back before the renewed assault, but now began seriously to contest ground, attempting to regain Smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of Papelotte.\nThe Prussian 24th Regiment linked up with a Highlander battalion on its far right and along with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20battle%20of%20the%20Waterloo%20campaign%23Prussian%204th%20Brigade\"&gt;13th \"Landwehr\" Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions. Further attacks by the 13th \"Landwehr\" and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont. Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield. The rest of d'Erlon's I Corps also broke and fled in panic, while to the west the French Middle Guard were assaulting Wellington's centre. The Prussian I Corps then advanced towards the Brussels road, the only line of retreat available to the French.\nAttack of the Imperial Guard.\nMeanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed by the fall of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard. Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the Anglo-allied line.\nNapoleon himself oversaw the initial deployment of the Middle and Old Guard. The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Friant\"&gt;Friant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul-Jean-Baptiste%20Poret%20de%20Morvan\"&gt;Poret de Morvan&lt;/a&gt;, on the right along the road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading the square of the 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General &lt;a href=\"Claude-%C3%89tienne%20Michel\"&gt;Michel&lt;/a&gt;, next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion. Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance. Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Halkett\"&gt;Colin Halkett&lt;/a&gt;'s brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the Anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.\nIt was at this critical moment that the Dutch General &lt;a href=\"David%20Hendrik%20Chass%C3%A9\"&gt;Chass\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; engaged the advancing French forces. Chass\u00e9's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain &lt;a href=\"Carel%20Frederik%20Krahmer%20de%20Bichin\"&gt;Krahmer de Bichin&lt;/a&gt;. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so Chass\u00e9 ordered his first brigade, commanded by Colonel &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20Detmers\"&gt;Hendrik Detmers&lt;/a&gt;, to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.\nTo the left of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had suffered more from artillery fire than the grenadiers. But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under &lt;a href=\"Peregrine%20Maitland\"&gt;Maitland&lt;/a&gt; who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the &lt;a href=\"52nd%20%28Oxfordshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;52nd Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;2nd Division&lt;/a&gt;), led by &lt;a href=\"John%20Colborne\"&gt;John Colborne&lt;/a&gt;, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd. The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: \"\"La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut\"!\" (\"The Guard is retreating. Every man for himself!\") Wellington now stood up in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;'s stirrups and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating French.\nThe surviving Imperial Guard rallied on their three reserve battalions (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte for a &lt;a href=\"last%20stand\"&gt;last stand&lt;/a&gt;. A charge from &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Adam\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;'s Brigade and the Hanoverian \"Landwehr\" Osnabr\u00fcck Battalion, plus Vivian's and Vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right, threw them into confusion. Those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards \"La Belle Alliance\". It was during this retreat that some of the Guards were invited to surrender, eliciting the famous, if apocryphal, retort \"\"&lt;a href=\"La%20Garde%20meurt%2C%20elle%20ne%20se%20rend%20pas%21\"&gt;La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!&lt;/a&gt;\"\" (\"The Guard dies, it does not surrender!\").\nPrussian capture of Plancenoit.\nAt about the same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were starting to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day. The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard\u2014the French centre of resistance\u2014had corpses strewn about \"as if by a whirlwind\". Five Guard battalions were deployed in support of the Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps. The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south. Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods.\nThe 25th Regiment's musketeer battalions threw the 1/2e Grenadiers (Old Guard) out of the Chantelet woods, outflanking Plancenoit and forcing a retreat. The Old Guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic, and became part of that rout. The Prussian IV Corps advanced beyond Plancenoit to find masses of French retreating in disorder from British pursuit. The Prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting Wellington's units. This was the fifth and final time that Plancenoit changed hands.\nFrench forces not retreating with the Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96\u00a0per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.\nFrench disintegration.\nThe French right, left, and centre had all now failed. The last cohesive French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around \"La Belle Alliance\"; they had been so placed to act as a final reserve and to protect Napoleon in the event of a French retreat. He hoped to rally the French army behind them, but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of \"La Belle Alliance\", in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn. Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square, while the Prussians engaged the other.\nAs dusk fell, both squares withdrew in relatively good order, but the French artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the Prussian and Anglo-allied armies. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops. Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as Genappe before ordering a halt. There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing of &lt;a href=\"Machiavelli\"&gt;Machiavelli&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Prince\"&gt;The Prince&lt;/a&gt;\", and diamonds left behind in the rush to escape. These diamonds became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the &lt;a href=\"Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite\"&gt;Pour le M\u00e9rite&lt;/a&gt; with oak leaves for the feat. By this time 78\u00a0guns and 2,000\u00a0prisoners had also been taken, including more generals.\nOther sources agree that the meeting of the commanders took place near \"La Belle Alliance\", with this occurring at around 21:00.\nAftermath.\nWaterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded and Bl\u00fccher some 7,000 (810 of which were suffered by just one unit: the 18th Regiment, which served in B\u00fclow's 15th Brigade, had fought at both Frichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33 &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Cross\"&gt;Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;es). Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or wounded and included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.\nAt 10:30 on 19 June General Grouchy, still following his orders, defeated General Thielemann at Wavre and withdrew in good order\u2014though at the cost of 33,000 French troops that never reached the Waterloo battlefield. Wellington sent describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815; it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a \"&lt;a href=\"The%20London%20Gazette\"&gt;London Gazette Extraordinary&lt;/a&gt;\" on 22 June. Wellington, Bl\u00fccher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris.\nAfter his troops fell back, Napoleon fled to Paris following his defeat, arriving at 5:30 am on 21 June. Napoleon wrote to his brother and regent in Paris, Joseph, believing that he could still raise an army to fight back the Anglo-Prussian forces while fleeing from the Waterloo battlefield. Napoleon believed he could rally French supporters to his cause and call upon conscripts to hold off invading forces until General Grouchy\u2019s army could reinforce him in Paris. However, following defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon\u2019s support from the French public and his own army waned, including by General Ney, who believed that Paris would fall if Napoleon remained in power. Napoleon\u2019s brother Lucien and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout advised him to continue fighting, dissolve the Chamber of Deputies from Louis XVIII\u2019s constitutional government, and for Napoleon to rule France as a dictator. To circumvent Napoleon overthrowing the Chamber of Deputies and a possible French Civil War, the Chamber of Deputies voted to become permanent on 21 June after persuasion from Lafayette. On 22 June, Napoleon wished to abdicate in favour of his son, Napoleon II, after realizing that he lacked military, public, and governmental support for his claim to continue to rule France. Napoleon\u2019s proposal for the instatement of his son was swiftly rejected by legislature.\nNapoleon announced his &lt;a href=\"Abdication%20of%20Napoleon%2C%201815\"&gt;second abdication&lt;/a&gt; on 24 June 1815. In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal &lt;a href=\"Davout\"&gt;Davout&lt;/a&gt;, Napoleon's minister of war, was defeated by Bl\u00fccher at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Issy\"&gt;Issy&lt;/a&gt; on 3 July 1815. Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; was blockading French ports to forestall such a move. He finally surrendered to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Lewis%20Maitland\"&gt;Frederick Maitland&lt;/a&gt; of on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; &lt;a href=\"Longwy\"&gt;Longwy&lt;/a&gt; capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVIII\"&gt;Louis XVIII&lt;/a&gt; was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Helena\"&gt;Saint Helena&lt;/a&gt;, where he died in 1821. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; was signed on 20 November 1815.\nMaitland's &lt;a href=\"Grenadier%20Guards\"&gt;1st Foot Guards&lt;/a&gt;, who had defeated the Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard, were thought to have defeated the Grenadiers, although they had only faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard. They were nevertheless awarded the title of Grenadier Guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins in the style of the Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%201st%20Light%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard lancers&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeeth of tens of thousands of dead soldiers were removed by surviving troops, locals or even scavengers who had travelled there from Britain, then used for making denture replacements in Britain and elsewhere. The so-called \"Waterloo teeth\" were in demand because they came from relatively healthy young men. Despite the efforts of scavengers both human and otherwise, human remains could still be seen at Waterloo a year after the battle.\nAnalysis.\nHistorical importance.\nWaterloo proved a decisive battle in more than one sense. Each generation in Europe up to the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history, seeing it in retrospect as the event that ushered in the &lt;a href=\"Concert%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Concert of Europe&lt;/a&gt;, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress.\nThe battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe - and involved other regions of the world - since the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of the early 1790s. It also ended the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.\nThere followed almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major international conflict occurred until the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt; of 1853\u20131856. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned in the aftermath of Waterloo, included the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Alliance\"&gt;Holy Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt; increasingly marked by the political dominance of &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bicentenary of Waterloo prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and to the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.\nViews on the reasons for Napoleon's defeat.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Antoine-Henri%20Jomini\"&gt;Antoine-Henri, Baron Jomini&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist &lt;a href=\"Carl%20von%20Clausewitz\"&gt;Carl von Clausewitz&lt;/a&gt;, who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\nWellington wrote in his dispatch to London,\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the \"Campaign of 1815\" and \"Wellington's famous 1842 essay\" in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. ... Bl\u00fccher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\". Steele (2014) writes: \"Bl\u00fccher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Bl\u00fccher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank, Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\".\nLegacy.\nBattlefield today.\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\". In 1820, the Netherlands' King &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;William I&lt;/a&gt; ordered the construction of a monument. The &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Mound\"&gt;Lion's Mound&lt;/a&gt;, a giant artificial hill, was constructed here using of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled \"L'Aigle bless\u00e9\" (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Philibert%20Duhesme\"&gt;Duhesme&lt;/a&gt; mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Genappe\"&gt;Genappe&lt;/a&gt;. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Cemetery%23The%20British%20Waterloo%20Campaign%20Monument\"&gt;British Monument&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Cemetery\"&gt;Brussels Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Evere\"&gt;Evere&lt;/a&gt;. The remains of a soldier thought to be 23-year-old Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012. He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His coins, rifle and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.\nCoin controversy.\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; minted a two-&lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2 euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.\nDiscovery at Mont St. Jean.\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at &lt;a href=\"Mont-Saint-Jean%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, found evidence of a clash between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 &lt;a href=\"musket%20ball\"&gt;musket ball&lt;/a&gt;s and 3 amputated human leg bones.\nFurther reading.\nMaps.\nPrimary sources"
