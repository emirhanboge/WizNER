    "text": "Isimud (also Isinu; Usm\u00fb; Usumu (&lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt;)) is a minor &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"sukkal\"&gt;sukkal&lt;/a&gt; of the god &lt;a href=\"Enki\"&gt;Enki&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamian%20mythology\"&gt;Sumerian mythology&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn ancient Sumerian artwork, Isimud is easily identifiable because he is always depicted with two faces facing in opposite directions in a way that is similar to the ancient Roman god &lt;a href=\"Janus\"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt;.\nMythology.\nIsimud appears in the legend of \"Inanna and Enki\", in which he is the one who greets Inanna upon her arrival to the E-Abzu temple in &lt;a href=\"Eridu\"&gt;Eridu&lt;/a&gt;. He also is the one who informs Enki that the \"&lt;a href=\"Me%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;mes&lt;/a&gt;\" have been stolen. In the myth, Isimud also serves as a messenger, telling Inanna to return the \"mes\" to Enki or face the consequences. Isimud plays a similar role to &lt;a href=\"Ninshubur\"&gt;Ninshubur&lt;/a&gt;, Inanna's \"sukkal\". Isimud also appears in the myth of \"Enki and &lt;a href=\"Ninhursag\"&gt;Ninhursag&lt;/a&gt;\", in which he acts as Enki's messenger and emissary."
