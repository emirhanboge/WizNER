    "text": "WCKY-FM (103.7 &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt;, \"Buckeye Country 103.7\") is a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20broadcasting\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; licensed to &lt;a href=\"Pemberville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Pemberville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, serving the &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; market. Owned by &lt;a href=\"iHeartMedia\"&gt;iHeartMedia&lt;/a&gt;, the station - branded as Buckeye Country 103.7 CKY - features a &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt; format.\nFrom its inception until 2008, the station was licensed to (and originally broadcast from) &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Tiffin, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"transmitter\"&gt;transmitter&lt;/a&gt; is located. Originally it simulcast and was a &lt;a href=\"sister%20station\"&gt;sister station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"WTTF\"&gt;WTTF&lt;/a&gt;, now an AM station at 1600\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hertz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt;. WCKY-FM's studios and offices are located at Superior and Lafayette in downtown Toledo.\nHistory.\nBeginnings: as WTTF-FM.\nWCKY-FM first signed on the air as WTTF-FM in 1963, four years after the premiere of its AM sister. The station was founded by Robert G. Wright and Milton Maltz, who formed Malrite Communications, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The station first broadcast from its &lt;a href=\"WTTF\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; transmitter site at an effective radiated power of 3,000 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt;s at the time of its inception.\nIn the mid-1980s, WTTF-FM was granted a construction permit to operate at an &lt;a href=\"effective%20radiated%20power\"&gt;effective radiated power&lt;/a&gt; of 50,000 watts making 103.7's signal listenable over much of &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Ohio\"&gt;Northwest Ohio&lt;/a&gt; as far west as &lt;a href=\"Defiance%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt;, to the east where almost makes to &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, to the south also almost making it to &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;. WTTF, Inc. built a new tower on County Road 48 to accommodate the larger antenna needed for the upgrade, on the property of its then vice president, Richard J. Wright. After the upgrade, there were few changes in the station's program offerings.\nAs one of the few high-powered &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; radio stations in rural northwest Ohio, the station offered a full-service format of both &lt;a href=\"oldies\"&gt;oldies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adult%20contemporary%20music\"&gt;adult contemporary music&lt;/a&gt;, with high school sports and college sports from &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%20University%20%28Ohio%29\"&gt;Heidelberg College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20University\"&gt;Tiffin University&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreak from Malrite.\nIn the late 1970s, Wright sold his interest in Malrite to his partner. The transaction resulted in the split of WTTF-AM-FM from Malrite and operated as a separate entity under Wright's management. Wright died of &lt;a href=\"lung%20cancer\"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s.\nHis younger son Richard, who served as the station's &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;, ascended to the position of General Manager. Wright's other son Robert (who answered to his middle name Ed until his father's death, then took the nickname \"Bob\") E. Wright, continued in his capacity as Program Director.\nWTTF in its heyday.\nWTTF prided itself on community service and had a full contingency of live on-air personnel at a time when most stations were automating. Music was delivered almost exclusively on records and the station had an extensive record library encompassing &lt;a href=\"Adult%20contemporary%20music\"&gt;adult contemporary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt;. There was a special Saturday &lt;a href=\"oldies\"&gt;oldies&lt;/a&gt; programming, on vinyl records supplied by the station and by the &lt;a href=\"disc%20jockey\"&gt;disc jockey&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; Telecommunications Act of 1996, which made the EAS (&lt;a href=\"Emergency%20Alert%20System\"&gt;Emergency Alert System&lt;/a&gt;) the law of the land, radio stations broadcast emergency information through EBS (&lt;a href=\"Emergency%20Broadcast%20System\"&gt;Emergency Broadcast System&lt;/a&gt;). Rather than pay full price for an expensive unit to receive EBS messages, Richard Wright built his own receiver, called the DW-76 (meaning Dick Wright and the year it was manufactured). The unit field-tested successfully, and received FCC Type Acceptance for legal use, but only for WTTF-AM-FM. \nBob Wright handled morning DJ duties with two others handling the midday and evening on-air DJ shifts, as well as a &lt;a href=\"news\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; staff of two. Bob also did a daily talk and opinion show called \"Sound Off\" from 11-11:30\u00a0a.m. Under the Wright ownership, the station only broadcast about 16 hours a day.\nThe station had a community service and &lt;a href=\"adult%20contemporary%20music\"&gt;adult contemporary music&lt;/a&gt; format during the day. During the evenings after 6pm, the station played &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt; on a program called the \"Double T Roundup,\" which lasted until the early 1980s. The &lt;a href=\"AM%20broadcasting\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; station (1600) signed off at local sundown until 1990, after receiving nighttime broadcasting rights. The &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; station (103.7) broadcast until 10pm. During the day, the two stations simulcast.\nAmong the many announcers that had peopled WTTF over the years were Jack Kagy (who served as news director for 19 years), Rick (Cochran) West (nearly eight years in the mid-day slot), Kevin Craig, Randy Dean, Ken Hawk, Andree Sterling, and Frank Barber. Many of these announcers and many others went on to larger markets for many years as WTTF provided a fertile training ground.\nSale, present day.\nBob Wright was killed in 1996 at the age of 56, following a head-on collision with a pickup truck during a snowstorm. As a result, the station was sold to &lt;a href=\"Jacor\"&gt;Jacor Communications&lt;/a&gt;, which was in turn acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now &lt;a href=\"iHeartMedia\"&gt;iHeartMedia&lt;/a&gt;) in 1999. After the sale of the station, former co-owner Dick Wright remained as an assistant engineer on a contract basis, up until his death January 1, 2008 &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article%3FAID%3D/20080104/NEWS13/801040395\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\nClear Channel initially was selling their &lt;a href=\"Findlay%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Findlay&lt;/a&gt; cluster, along with other small market clusters, over to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;-based GoodRadio.TV LLC in May 2007, but the deal soon collapsed prior to FCC approval. Clear Channel ended up spinning off WTTF, along with the Sandusky cluster and &lt;a href=\"WPFX-FM\"&gt;WPFX&lt;/a&gt; over to Fremont-based BAS Broadcasting on January 15, 2008. BAS took over WTTF on February 1, and as WCKY-FM was not included in the deal, this ended 45 years of common ownership between the two stations.\nIn December 2007, the \"Buckeye Country\" moniker was dropped in favor of branding with its call letters. Its city of license was also shifted to &lt;a href=\"Pemberville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Pemberville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; to closer target &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 2, 2019, WCKY shifted to a traditional &lt;a href=\"Country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; format focused primarily on country hits from the 1980s and 1990s, and revived the previous \"Buckeye Country\" branding. WCKY is currently the Northwest Ohio affiliate of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bobby%20Bones%20Show\"&gt;The Bobby Bones Show&lt;/a&gt;."
