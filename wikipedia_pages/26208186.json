The convention pertains specifically to a &lt;a href=\"ship%27s%20load%20line\"&gt;ship's load line&lt;/a&gt; (also referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;\"), a marking of the highest point on a ship's &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; that can safely meet the surface of the water; a ship that is loaded to the point where its load line is underwater and no longer visible has exceeded its &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; and is in danger because its capacity has been exceeded.\nThe 1988 Protocol was adopted to harmonise the survey and certification requirement of the 1966 Convention with those contained in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Convention%20for%20the%20Safety%20of%20Life%20at%20Sea\"&gt;International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea&lt;/a&gt; (SOLAS) and &lt;a href=\"MARPOL%2073/78\"&gt;MARPOL 73/78&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines (CLL 66/88), all assigned load lines must be marked amidships on each side of the ships engaged in international voyages. The determinations of the freeboard of ships are calculated and/or verified by &lt;a href=\"classification%20society\"&gt;classification societies&lt;/a&gt; which issue International Load Line Certificates in accordance with the legislation of participating States.\nProvisions.\nThe Convention provides for the terms of ship's surveys, issuance, duration, validity and acceptance of International Load Line Certificates, as well as relevant State control measures, agreed exemptions and exceptions.\nAnnexes to the Convention contain various regulations for determining load lines, including details of marking and verification of marks, conditions of assignment of freeboard, freeboard tables and corrections, special provisions for ships intended for the carriage of timber and the prescribed form of International Load Line Certificates.\nAccording to the Annexes to the Convention, also taken into account are the potential hazards present in different zones and different seasons and additional safety measures concerning doors, hatchways, etc."
