    "text": "The Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) is one of the two major &lt;a href=\"political%20parties\"&gt;political parties&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone\"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;, along with its main political rival the &lt;a href=\"All%20People%27s%20Congress\"&gt;All People's Congress&lt;/a&gt; (APC). It has been the &lt;a href=\"ruling%20party\"&gt;ruling party&lt;/a&gt; in Sierra Leone since April 4, 2018.\nThe SLPP dominated Sierra Leone's politics from its foundation in 1951 to 1967, when it lost the 1967 parliamentary election to the APC, led by &lt;a href=\"Siaka%20Stevens\"&gt;Siaka Stevens&lt;/a&gt;. Originally a &lt;a href=\"centre-right\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; party, since 2012 it identifies as a &lt;a href=\"Social%20democracy\"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; party with a centrist tendency.\nThe SLPP returned to power when its leader &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Tejan%20Kabbah\"&gt;Ahmad Tejan Kabbah&lt;/a&gt; won the 1996 presidential election. The party was in power from 1996 to 2007, when it again lost to the APC, led by &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Bai%20Koroma\"&gt;Ernest Bai Koroma&lt;/a&gt;, in the 2007 presidential election. SLPP returned to power in 2018 on the 4th of April when &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Maada%20Bio\"&gt;Julius Maada Bio&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as the new President of Sierra Leone after winning the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Sierra%20Leonean%20general%20election\"&gt;2018 Sierra Leone presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.\nSLPP is overwhelmingly popular in &lt;a href=\"Mende%20people\"&gt;Mende&lt;/a&gt; areas in south and eastern Sierra Leone (except in &lt;a href=\"Kono%20District\"&gt;Kono District&lt;/a&gt;, a swing district), where the party regularly wins presidential, parliamentary and local elections by large margins. The SLPP has large minority support in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Area\"&gt;Western Area&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Freetown\"&gt;Freetown&lt;/a&gt;). The SLPP also has large minority support in &lt;a href=\"Koinadugu%20District\"&gt;Koinadugu District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falaba%20District\"&gt;Falaba District&lt;/a&gt; in the north of the country. The SLPP also has significant minority support in &lt;a href=\"Kambia%20District\"&gt;Kambia District&lt;/a&gt; in the north of the country.\nEarly success and Independence.\nSLPP dominated politics in Sierra Leone in the years following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1955 and 1956, riots occurred in Sierra Leone, originally sparked by the artisan union's strike over pay; further unrest followed strikes by transport workers. These events grew animosity between the SLPP and &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone%20Creole%20people\"&gt;Krio&lt;/a&gt; parties, especially the &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20Rogers-Wright\"&gt;Cyril Rogers-Wright&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"United%20Sierra%20Leone%20Progressive%20Party\"&gt;United Sierra Leone Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1954. The SLPP positioned itself as \"the countryman's party,\" and garnered the support of tribal chiefs.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leonean%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201957\"&gt;elections in 1957&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Margai\"&gt;Milton Margai&lt;/a&gt; bowed to behind-the-scenes pressure and stepped down from SLPP leadership, replaced by his brother &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Margai\"&gt;Albert Margai&lt;/a&gt;. However, in 1958, Albert Margai and &lt;a href=\"Siaka%20Stevens\"&gt;Siaka Stevens&lt;/a&gt; launched a new party, the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20National%20Party\"&gt;People's National Party&lt;/a&gt; (PNP), which aimed for greater African involvement in the British colonial government. With the independence of &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; in 1957, the PNP sought the support of the educated elite to lead a transition to independence. Stevens would later leave the party to form the northern-supported &lt;a href=\"All%20Peoples%20Congress\"&gt;All Peoples Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Upon independence in 1961, &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Margai\"&gt;Milton Margai&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"prime%20minister\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;, and the SLPP became the ruling party. The SLPP, along with almost all Sierra Leonean political parties, signed the constitution at the London constitutional conference; the APC was the notable exception. This unity did not extend to national politics, as opposing politicians often faced detainment under SLPP rule.\nDemise.\n&lt;a href=\"Milton%20Margai\"&gt;Sir Milton Margai&lt;/a&gt;'s death in 1964 left SLPP leadership to his brother &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Margai\"&gt;Sir Albert Margai&lt;/a&gt;. Albert's rule was characterized by dissent. Politically, he attempted to strengthen the position of SLPP elites relative to the chiefs, who had formed the backbone of the party. Albert's autocratic leadership style was questioned within his party, sparked by actions such as the demotion of senior party members Alhaji M.S. Mustapha and Kerefa Smart. Albert also embarked on a policy of &lt;a href=\"Africanisation\"&gt;Africanisation&lt;/a&gt;, which removed some civil servants who favored a colonialistic approach. Scores of schools were built in the provinces along with Teachers Colleges in every district (Makeni, Magbruka, Moyamba, and the Milton Margai Teachers College).\nOpposing leaders criticized Margai's presentation of a bill to establish a &lt;a href=\"one-party%20system\"&gt;one-party system&lt;/a&gt; in Sierra Leone and also blamed Margai for developments had led to an economic slowdown. In the 1967 elections, the APC and SLPP each won 32 seats in parliament, with 2 former SLPP Independents siding with the APC MPs Kutubu Kai-Samba and Luseni A. M Brewah. This development confirmed that the SLPP would no longer lead the country.\nThe subsequent political unrest led to the declaration of martial law and a military coup that took full control of the national government. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Reformation%20Council\"&gt;National Reformation Council&lt;/a&gt; (NRC), led by Major Charles Blake, was established on 23 March 1967. Pressure from political elites, trade unions, and university students led to the junta's collapse in November 1970, and Siaka Stevens of the APC became president after the interregnum.\nUnder Stevens, Sierra Leone became a one-party state. In 1978 all SLPP MPs except one (Manna Kpaka, MP in Kenema) joined the APC. The SLPP was outlawed, and its elites and supporters were physically threatened and barred from holding meetings.\nRebirth.\nIn 1996 SLPP returned to prominence, as its candidate &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Tejan%20Kabbah\"&gt;Ahmad Tejan Kabbah&lt;/a&gt; won the presidential election, receiving 59.5% of the popular vote in a second round against &lt;a href=\"John%20Karefa-Smart\"&gt;John Karefa-Smart&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20National%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;United National People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (UNPP). In the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leonean%20general%20election%2C%202002\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; held on 14 May 2002, the party won 69.9% of the popular vote and 83 out of 112 seats in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Sierra%20Leone\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, and its candidate in the presidential election, Kabbah, won 70.1% of the vote and was re-elected.\nAt the SLPP's national convention in &lt;a href=\"Makeni\"&gt;Makeni&lt;/a&gt; on 3\u20134 September 2005, Vice-President &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Berewa\"&gt;Solomon Berewa&lt;/a&gt; was selected by the SLPP as its leader and 2007 presidential candidate. He received 291 votes, while &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Margai\"&gt;Charles Margai&lt;/a&gt; received 34, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Maada%20Bio\"&gt;Julius Maada Bio&lt;/a&gt; received 33, and &lt;a href=\"J.%20B.%20Dauda\"&gt;J. B. Dauda&lt;/a&gt; received 28. In the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leonean%20general%20election%2C%202007\"&gt;August 2007 election&lt;/a&gt;, the SLPP was defeated by the APC in the parliamentary election, winning 43 seats against 59 for the APC; the PMDC, a splinter party founded by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Margai\"&gt;Charles Margai&lt;/a&gt;, attracted the support of some traditional SLPP voters, winning 10 seats. In the presidential election, the SLPP candidate, Berewa, took second place in the first round, winning 38.3% of the vote against 44.3% for the APC candidate, &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Bai%20Koroma\"&gt;Ernest Bai Koroma&lt;/a&gt;. A second round of the presidential election was held in September; Koroma prevailed with 54.6% of the vote against 45.4% for Berewa.\nThe SLPP constitution requires its leader to resign if the party loses a national election; Berewa resigned as party leader on 17 October 2007, leaving &lt;a href=\"Alhaji%20Sulaiman%20Jah\"&gt;Alhaji Sulaiman Jah&lt;/a&gt; as acting leader. In 2011, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Maada%20Bio\"&gt;Julius Maada Bio&lt;/a&gt; became SLPP's nominee for the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leonean%20general%20election%2C%202012\"&gt;2012 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. He beat &lt;a href=\"Usman%20Boie%20Kamara\"&gt;Usman Boie Kamara&lt;/a&gt;, who came in second place. Bio was nominated as the SLPP candidate for president in the 2018 election, which he ultimately won."
