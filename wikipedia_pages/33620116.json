    "text": "This partial list of city nicknames in Idaho compiles the &lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;aliases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sobriquet\"&gt;sobriquet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slogan\"&gt;slogan&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; are known by (or have been known by historically), officially and unofficially, to municipal governments, local people, outsiders or their &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt; boards or &lt;a href=\"chambers%20of%20commerce\"&gt;chambers of commerce&lt;/a&gt;. City nicknames can help in establishing a civic identity, helping outsiders recognize a community or attracting people to a community because of its nickname; promote civic pride; and build community unity. &lt;a href=\"Nickname\"&gt;Nickname&lt;/a&gt;s and slogans that successfully create a new community \"ideology or myth\" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \"&lt;a href=\"brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt;ing\" themselves by adopting new slogans.\nSome unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive. The unofficial nicknames listed here have been in use for a long time or have gained wide currency.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"
