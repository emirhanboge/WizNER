    "text": "B\u00e1et\u00e1n moccu Chormaic, &lt;a href=\"abbot\"&gt;abbot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clonmacnoise\"&gt;Clonmacnoise&lt;/a&gt;, died 1 March 664.\nB\u00e1et\u00e1n was a member of the Moccu Chormaic, a prominent line of the &lt;a href=\"Conmaicne%20Mara\"&gt;Conmaicne Mara&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Connemara\"&gt;Connemara&lt;/a&gt;). In 653 he became ninth abbot of Clonmacnoise in succession to Aedlug mac Caman. He held office for twelve years, a considerable period considering most candidates were elderly. \nHe may have been an &lt;a href=\"exegetical\"&gt;exegetical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scholarly%20method\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;. Michael Richter argues that he was a teacher of the &lt;a href=\"De%20mirabilibus%20sacrae%20scripturae\"&gt;Irish \"Augustine\"&lt;/a&gt; (died 665), identifying him with the \"Bathanus\" named by Augustine in his \"De mirabilibus sacrae scripturae\".\nHe was included in the martyrologies, which implies he was considered, at least by some, to be a man of saintly character. He was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Colm%C3%A1n%20Cass%20mac%20Fualascaig\"&gt;Colm\u00e1n Cass mac Fualascaig&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Corcu%20Moga\"&gt;Corcu Moga&lt;/a&gt; of what is now north-east &lt;a href=\"County%20Galway\"&gt;County Galway&lt;/a&gt;"
