    "text": "Dolphin shorts or Dolfins are a specific style of unisex &lt;a href=\"shorts\"&gt;shorts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;. They are typically very short and were originally made from nylon with contrasting binding, side slits, and rounded corners, with a &lt;a href=\"waistband\"&gt;waistband&lt;/a&gt; at the top\u2014a style popular in the 1980s.\nThe name is from &lt;a href=\"Dolfin%20Swimwear\"&gt;Dolfin&lt;/a&gt;, the American company that first produced this style of shorts in the 1980s. Due to their shortness, they are sometimes identified as a form of &lt;a href=\"hotpants\"&gt;hotpants&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne high-profile wearer of \"dolphin shorts\" is &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Simmons\"&gt;Richard Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, who boasted of owning 400 pairs of vintage Dolfins in 2012.\nOrange Dolfin shorts are specified as part of the uniform for waitresses at &lt;a href=\"Hooters\"&gt;Hooters&lt;/a&gt;."
