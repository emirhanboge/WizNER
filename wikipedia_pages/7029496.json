    "text": "The A1 Grand Prix car was a vehicle designed to compete in the &lt;a href=\"A1%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;A1 Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;. The car was standardised for every team to provide a level playing field for competing nations. It was designed to reduce the volume of \"dirty air\", allowing drivers to close in on the car in front, encouraging &lt;a href=\"overtaking\"&gt;overtaking&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Coachwork\"&gt;bodywork&lt;/a&gt; was mainly pre-impregnated &lt;a href=\"Carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer\"&gt;carbon fibre&lt;/a&gt; composites. From &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferrari\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; was consulted on the design and manufacture for all A1 Grand Prix cars.\nLola-Zytek car (2005\u201306 to 2007\u201308).\nThe Lola B05/52 was the spec car used by the series from the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;. It was powered by &lt;a href=\"Zytek\"&gt;Zytek&lt;/a&gt; engines, and ran on &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20Tire%20%26amp%3B%20Rubber%20Company\"&gt;Cooper&lt;/a&gt; tyres. The former chassis is now used in the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20GP\"&gt;Euroseries 3000&lt;/a&gt;, starting in &lt;a href=\"2009%20Euroseries%203000%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.\nChassis.\nThe chassis, designated Lola A1GP, is made and designed by &lt;a href=\"Lola%20Cars\"&gt;Lola Cars&lt;/a&gt;. The A1 Car's carbon fibre skin cloaks a core of &lt;a href=\"aluminium\"&gt;aluminium&lt;/a&gt; honeycomb. Based on bionic engineering principles found in nature, the hexagonal honeycomb provides remarkable strength for its weight, and has progressive deformation properties in response to an impact, which contributes to driver safety. In addition, drivers are protected by &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile\"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt;-approved side intrusion panels that protect them from lateral impacts.\nEngine.\nThe engine for the cars was developed by &lt;a href=\"Zytek\"&gt;Zytek Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. The 3.4-litre V8 unit is capable of delivering 520 &lt;a href=\"Horsepower%23Brake%20horsepower\"&gt;bhp&lt;/a&gt; (550\u00a0bhp in PowerBoost mode). Each engine must be very durable, as it must last a whole season. The engine only weighs 120 kilograms, making it one of the lightest 3.4-litre engines ever made.\nTechnical specifications.\nThe car has an overall length of 4833\u00a0mm, with a long wheelbase of 3000\u00a0mm and a wide track of 1476\u00a0mm (front) and 1468\u00a0mm (rear). Its total weight amounts to 615 kilograms, without the driver and the fuel.\nSuspension.\nThe front and rear &lt;a href=\"suspension%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;suspension&lt;/a&gt; is of a &lt;a href=\"Double%20wishbone%20suspension\"&gt;double wishbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Overhead%20valve\"&gt;pushrod&lt;/a&gt; operated twin coil over &lt;a href=\"Shock%20absorber\"&gt;damper&lt;/a&gt; construction. Adjustable &lt;a href=\"ride%20height\"&gt;ride height&lt;/a&gt;, cambers and toe, as well as anti-dive and anti-squat made to optimise drive control.\nClutch.\nA two-piece carbon clutch was tailored especially for the car to handle the exceptional torque of a racing engine with up to and the two racing starts per weekend. The unit combines lightweight construction with durability and bullet-proof reliability. The A1 car's gearchange is by an electronically controlled paddle-shifting via a six-speed &lt;a href=\"Semi-automatic%20transmission\"&gt;paddle-shift semi-automatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sequential%20manual%20transmission\"&gt;sequential transmission&lt;/a&gt; peak loads at full throttle could literally shred a lesser clutch. The two-piece carbon clutch can take the load, even when the driver changes up with the PowerBoost activated. In hot and cold testing the clutch proved faultless. The clutch operation of the A1GP car was operated by the foot-pedal on the very left side.\nPowerBoost.\nThe PowerBoost button on the A1 car allows the engine to reach its maximum of . When used at the right time, this feature can encourage overtaking. For the PowerBoost to activate, the throttle position must be above 80% and the speed more than 60\u00a0km/h. The button must also be depressed to continue on PowerBoost mode. However, the PowerBoost automatically deactivates itself if the throttle falls below 40%. Each driver only has a limited number of uses of the PowerBoost function. The driver can only use it four times in a sprint race and eight times in a feature race. Once these maximum allocated uses of the PowerBoost have been used, the system is disabled until the end of the race, after which Zytek engineers reset the system for the next race.\nTyres.\nA1 Grand Prix uses slick tyres on normal dry races. Pneumatics were supplied exclusively by &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20Tire%20%26amp%3B%20Rubber%20Company\"&gt;Cooper Tires&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuel.\nA1 Grand Prix uses 100 RON &lt;a href=\"Biofuel\"&gt;Biofuel&lt;/a&gt; for all cars.\n\"Powered by Ferrari\" car (2008\u201309).\nOn 22 July 2008, information regarding the then-new \"Powered by Ferrari\" A1GP car was revealed. It was only used for the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20A1%20Grand%20Prix%20season\"&gt;2008-2009 season&lt;/a&gt; as the series was cancelled for the next season.\nChassis.\nThe chassis is based on the &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20F2004\"&gt;Ferrari F2004&lt;/a&gt; chassis. It is made from carbon-fibre skins with an aluminium honeycomb core, and has been tested to meet all &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile\"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; crash safety standards.\nEngine.\nThe engine is built by &lt;a href=\"Ferrari\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. It is a 4.5-litre &lt;a href=\"Ferrari/Maserati%20engine\"&gt;Ferrari/Maserati&lt;/a&gt; V8 engine capable of delivering in PowerBoost mode. The new engine weighs 160\u00a0kg, 40\u00a0kg more than the previously-used &lt;a href=\"Zytek\"&gt;Zytek&lt;/a&gt; engines.\nPowerBoost.\nEach car is equipped with a unique PowerBoost system, a mechanism to provide short bursts of increased power to create additional overtaking opportunities and action throughout the race. By changing the engine's parameters, the system can give the driver additional power over a limited time during each race to take the car from the base to its maximum power of .\nThe PowerBoost is driver-activated by a button mounted on the steering wheel. While the number of PowerBoost uses remain unchanged from Zytek era (4 times in Sprint races and 8 times in Feature races), a new rule for the season allowed drivers to use it for the entirety of a single lap during qualifying sessions.\nWheels and tyres.\n&lt;a href=\"Michelin\"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt; was contracted to be the exclusive tyre supplier for three seasons beginning with 2008\u201309 season. Only one season was completed under this contract as the series was cancelled afterwards. Wheel rims were supplied by &lt;a href=\"OZ%20Group\"&gt;OZ Racing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe designs stemmed from Formula One technologies that seek to offer both optimal performance and safety to the driver. Full rubber serration tests were performed on various tracks such as &lt;a href=\"Fiorano%20Circuit\"&gt;Fiorano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Autodromo%20Enzo%20e%20Dino%20Ferrari\"&gt;Imola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Circuito%20Permanente%20de%20Jerez\"&gt;Jerez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mugello%20Circuit\"&gt;Mugello&lt;/a&gt; resulting in an optimal compromise between grip, endurance and wear."
