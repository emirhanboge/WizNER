    "title": "Adalbert Stifter",
    "text": "Adalbert Stifter (; 23 October 1805 \u2013 28 January 1868) was an &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20literature\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; writer, poet, painter, and &lt;a href=\"pedagogy\"&gt;pedagogue&lt;/a&gt;. He was notable for the vivid natural landscapes depicted in his writing and has long been popular in the German-speaking world, while remaining almost entirely unknown to English readers.\nLife.\nBorn in Oberplan in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Horn%C3%AD%20Plan%C3%A1\"&gt;Horn\u00ed Plan\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;), he was the eldest son of Johann Stifter, a wealthy &lt;a href=\"linen\"&gt;linen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weaver%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;weaver&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife, Magdalena. Johann died in 1817 after being crushed by an overturned wagon. Stifter was educated at the \" Benedictine Gymnasium\" at &lt;a href=\"Kremsm%C3%BCnster%20Abbey\"&gt;Kremsm\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt;, and went to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in 1826 to study law. In 1828 he fell in love with Fanny Greipl, but after a relationship lasting five years, her parents forbade further correspondence, a loss from which he never recovered. In 1835 he became engaged to Amalia Mohaupt, and they married in 1837, but the marriage was not a happy one. Stifter and his wife, unable to conceive, tried adopting three of Amalia's nieces at different times. One of them, Juliana, ran away several times and finally disappeared, only to be found drowned in the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; four weeks later.\nAs a man of strong &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; convictions who welcomed the &lt;a href=\"1848%20revolutions\"&gt;1848 revolutions&lt;/a&gt; and allowed his name to go forward as a candidate in the &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Parliament\"&gt;Frankfurt Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, even suspected by others of being a radical, the cornerstone of Stifter's philosophy was &lt;a href=\"Bildung\"&gt;Bildung&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of becoming a state official, he became a &lt;a href=\"tutor\"&gt;tutor&lt;/a&gt; to the aristocrats of &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, and was highly regarded as such. His students included Princess &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Anna%20von%20Schwarzenberg\"&gt;Maria Anna von Schwarzenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Klemens%2C%20Prince%20von%20Metternich\"&gt;Richard Metternich&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Klemens%20Wenzel%2C%20Prince%20von%20Metternich\"&gt;Klemens Wenzel von Metternich&lt;/a&gt;. He also made some money from selling paintings, and published his first story, \"Der Condor\", in 1840. An immediate success, it inaugurated a steady writing career.\nStifter visited &lt;a href=\"Linz\"&gt;Linz&lt;/a&gt; in 1848, and moved there permanently a year later, where he became editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"Linzer%20Zeitung\"&gt;Linzer Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Wiener%20Bote\"&gt;Wiener Bote&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1850 he was appointed supervisor of elementary schools for &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Austria\"&gt;Upper Austria&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis physical and mental health began to decline in 1863, and he became seriously ill from &lt;a href=\"cirrhosis\"&gt;cirrhosis of the liver&lt;/a&gt; in 1867. In deep depression, he slashed his neck with a razor on the night of 25 January 1868 and died three days later.\nWork.\nStifter's work is characterized by the pursuit of beauty; his characters strive to be moral and move in gorgeous landscapes luxuriously described. Evil, cruelty, and suffering rarely appear on the surface of his writing, but &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Mann\"&gt;Thomas Mann&lt;/a&gt; noted that \"behind the quiet, inward exactitude of his descriptions of Nature in particular there is at work a predilection for the excessive, the elemental and the catastrophic, the pathological.\" Although considered by some to be one-dimensional compared to his more famous and realistic contemporaries, his visions of ideal worlds reflect his informal allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Biedermeier\"&gt;Biedermeier&lt;/a&gt; movement in literature. As Carl Schorske puts it, \"To illustrate and propagate his concept of &lt;a href=\"Bildung\"&gt;Bildung&lt;/a&gt;, compounded of &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; world piety, German &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt;, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel \"Der Nachsommer\"\".\nThe majority of his works are long stories or short novels, many of which were published in multiple versions, sometimes radically changed. His major works are the long novels \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Nachsommer\"&gt;Der Nachsommer&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Witiko%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Witiko&lt;/a&gt;\".\nStifter's \"Der Nachsommer\" (1857) and &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Keller\"&gt;Gottfried Keller&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Die Leute von Seldwyla\" (\"The People of Seldwyla\") were named the two great German novels of the 19th century by &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Nietzsche\"&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;. \"Der Nachsommer\" is considered one of the finest examples of the &lt;a href=\"Bildungsroman\"&gt;Bildungsroman&lt;/a&gt;, but received a mixed reception from critics at the time. &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Friedrich%20Hebbel\"&gt;Friedrich Hebbel&lt;/a&gt; offered the crown of Poland to whoever could finish it, and called Stifter a writer only interested in \"beetles and buttercups.\" The excessive detail for which Hebbel derided the novel, is, according to Christine Oertel Sj\u00f6gren, \"precisely a source of fascination for modern scholars, who seize upon the number of objects as the distinguishing characteristic of this novel and accord it high esteem because of the very significance of the 'things' in it. Far from being extraneous elements, as Hebbel regarded them, the art and nature objects provide a rich setting of beauty and a mirror-background to the human story in the foreground.\" [3]:20\n\"Witiko\" is a historical novel set in the 12th century, a strange work panned by many critics, but praised by &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Hesse\"&gt;Hermann Hesse&lt;/a&gt; and Thomas Mann. &lt;a href=\"Dietrich%20Bonhoeffer\"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer&lt;/a&gt; found great comfort from his reading of \"Witiko\" while in Tegel Prison under Nazi arrest.\nInfluence.\nIn the German edition of his \"Reminiscences\", &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Schurz\"&gt;Carl Schurz&lt;/a&gt; recalls his meeting with the daughter of the keeper of the Swiss inn he was staying at whose favorite book was Stifter's \"Studien\". This incident occurred prior to 1852.\nHe was named as an influence by &lt;a href=\"W.%20G.%20Sebald\"&gt;W. G. Sebald&lt;/a&gt;, and both &lt;a href=\"W.%20H.%20Auden\"&gt;W. H. Auden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marianne%20Moore\"&gt;Marianne Moore&lt;/a&gt; admired his work, the latter co-translating \"&lt;a href=\"Bergkristall\"&gt;Bergkristall&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"&lt;a href=\"Rock%20Crystal\"&gt;Rock Crystal&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Mayer\"&gt;Elizabeth Mayer&lt;/a&gt; in 1945. Auden included Stifter in his poem \"&lt;a href=\"Academic%20Graffiti\"&gt;Academic Graffiti&lt;/a&gt;\" as one of the celebrities, literary and otherwise, captured in a &lt;a href=\"clerihew\"&gt;clerihew&lt;/a&gt;: Adalbert Stifter / Was no weight-lifter: / He would hire old lags / To carry his bags.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Hesse\"&gt;Hermann Hesse&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Steppenwolf%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Steppenwolf&lt;/a&gt;\", the main character Harry Haller wonders \"whether it isn't time to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter and have an accident while shaving\".\n&lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Mann\"&gt;Thomas Mann&lt;/a&gt; was also an admirer of Stifter, calling him \"one of the most extraordinary, the most enigmatic, the most secretly daring and the most strangely gripping narrators in world literature.\"\nRilke and Hugo von Hofmannsthal were deeply indebted to his art.\nRecent production.\nIn 2007 German theater director &lt;a href=\"Heiner%20Goebbels\"&gt;Heiner Goebbels&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by works of Adalbert Stifter, composed and directed a musical installation called \"Stifters Dinge\" (\"Stifter's Things\"), which premiered in 2007 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Vidy-Lausanne, in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland."
