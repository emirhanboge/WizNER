    "text": "Bura (also Boura, Bira; ) was an ancient &lt;a href=\"polis\"&gt;polis&lt;/a&gt; (city-state) of &lt;a href=\"Achaea\"&gt;Achaea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, one of the 12 cities of the &lt;a href=\"Achaean%20League\"&gt;Achaean League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said to have derived its name from &lt;a href=\"Bura%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Bura&lt;/a&gt;, a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ion%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Ion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helike%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Helice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city was situated on a height 40 stadia from the sea, and southeast of &lt;a href=\"Helike\"&gt;Helike&lt;/a&gt;. Its name occurs in a line of &lt;a href=\"Aeschylus\"&gt;Aeschylus&lt;/a&gt;, preserved by &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt;. It was swallowed up by the earthquake which destroyed Helike in 373 BCE, and all its inhabitants perished except those who were absent at the time. On their return they rebuilt the city, which was visited by &lt;a href=\"Pausanias%20%28geographer%29\"&gt;Pausanias&lt;/a&gt;, who mentions its temples dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eileithyia\"&gt;Eileithyia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isis\"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt;. Strabo relates that there was a fountain at Bura called \"Sybaris\", from which the river and &lt;a href=\"Sybaris\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Graecia\"&gt;Magna Graecia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; derived its name. On the revival of the Achaean League in 280 BCE, Bura was governed by a &lt;a href=\"tyrant\"&gt;tyrant&lt;/a&gt;, whom the inhabitants slew in 275 BCE, and then joined the confederacy. A little to the east of Bura was the river &lt;a href=\"Vouraikos\"&gt;Bura\u00efcus&lt;/a&gt;; and on the banks of this river, between Bura and the sea, was an oracular cavern of &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt; surnamed Buraicus.\nThe ruins of Bura have been discovered nearly midway between the rivers of &lt;a href=\"Bokhusia\"&gt;Bokhusia&lt;/a&gt; (Cerynites), and of &lt;a href=\"Vouraikos\"&gt;Vouraikos&lt;/a&gt; (Buraicus) near &lt;a href=\"Trupia\"&gt;Trupia&lt;/a&gt;. Ovid says that the ruins of Bura (which he calls \"Bira\"), like those of Helike, were still to be seen at the bottom of the sea. &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt; makes the same assertion. Hence it has been supposed that the ancient Bura stood upon the coast, and after its destruction was rebuilt inland; but neither Pausanias nor Strabo states that the ancient city was on the coast, and their words render it improbable. Modern scholars tentatively identify the ruins at the \"kastro\" near &lt;a href=\"Diakofto\"&gt;Diakofto&lt;/a&gt; with Bura."
