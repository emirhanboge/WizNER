    "title": "Fauna",
    "text": "Fauna is all of the &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; life present in a particular region or time. The corresponding term for &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s is \"&lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;\", and for &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, it is \"&lt;a href=\"funga\"&gt;funga&lt;/a&gt;\". Flora, fauna, funga and other forms of life are collectively referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Biota%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;biota&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Zoologist\"&gt;Zoologist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paleontologist\"&gt;paleontologist&lt;/a&gt;s use \"fauna\" to refer to a typical collection of animals found in a specific time or place, e.g. the \"&lt;a href=\"Sonoran%20Desert\"&gt;Sonoran Desert&lt;/a&gt; fauna\" or the \"&lt;a href=\"Burgess%20Shale\"&gt;Burgess Shale&lt;/a&gt; fauna\". &lt;a href=\"Paleontology\"&gt;Paleontologists&lt;/a&gt; sometimes refer to a sequence of &lt;a href=\"faunal%20stage\"&gt;faunal stage&lt;/a&gt;s, which is a series of rocks all containing similar fossils. The study of animals of a particular region is called faunistics.\nEtymology.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Fauna%20of%20Madagascar\"&gt;Fauna&lt;/a&gt;\" comes from the name &lt;a href=\"Fauna%20%28deity%29\"&gt;Fauna&lt;/a&gt;, a Roman goddess of earth and fertility, the Roman god &lt;a href=\"Faunus\"&gt;Faunus&lt;/a&gt;, and the related forest spirits called &lt;a href=\"Faun\"&gt;Faun&lt;/a&gt;s. All three words are cognates of the name of the Greek god &lt;a href=\"Pan%20%28god%29\"&gt;Pan&lt;/a&gt;, and \"panis\" is the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; equivalent of fauna. \"Fauna\" is also the word for a book that catalogues the animals in such a manner. The term was first used by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; from Sweden in the title of his 1745 work \"Fauna Suecica\".\nSubdivisions on the basis of region.\nCryofauna.\n\"Cryofauna\" refers to the animals that live in, or very close to, cold areas.\nCryptofauna.\n\"Cryptofauna\" are the fauna that exist in protected or concealed &lt;a href=\"microhabitats\"&gt;microhabitats&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpifauna.\nEpifauna, also called \"epibenthos\", are aquatic animals that live on the bottom substratum as opposed to within it, that is, the &lt;a href=\"benthic\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; fauna that live on top of the sediment surface at the seafloor.\nInfauna.\n\"Infauna\" are &lt;a href=\"Benthic%20zone\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; organisms that live within the bottom substratum of a water body, especially within the bottom-most oceanic sediments, the layer of small particles at the bottom of a body of water, rather than on its surface. &lt;a href=\"Bacteria\"&gt;Bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"microalgae\"&gt;microalgae&lt;/a&gt; may also live in the interstices of bottom sediments. In general, infaunal animals become progressively smaller and less abundant with increasing water depth and dreas bacteria show more constancy in abundance, tending toward one million cells per milliliter of interstitial seawater.\nSuch creatures are found in the fossil record and include &lt;a href=\"lingulata\"&gt;lingulata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trilobite\"&gt;trilobites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Worm\"&gt;worms&lt;/a&gt;. They made burrows in the sediment as protection and may also have fed upon detritus or the mat of microbes which tended to grow on the surface of the sediment. Today, a variety of organisms live in and &lt;a href=\"Bioturbation\"&gt;disturb the sediment&lt;/a&gt;. The deepest burrowers are the ghost shrimps (\"&lt;a href=\"Thalassinidea\"&gt;Thalassinidea&lt;/a&gt;\"), which go as deep as into the sediment at the bottom of the ocean.\nLimnofauna.\n\"Limnofauna\" refers to the animals that live in fresh water.\nMacrofauna.\n\"Macrofauna\" are &lt;a href=\"benthic\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; or soil organisms which are retained on a 0.5\u00a0mm sieve. Studies in the deep sea define macrofauna as animals retained on a 0.3\u00a0mm sieve to account for the small size of many of the taxa.\nMegafauna.\n\"Megafauna\" are large animals of any particular region or time. For example, &lt;a href=\"Australian%20megafauna\"&gt;Australian megafauna&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeiofauna.\n\"Meiofauna\" are small &lt;a href=\"benthic\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s that live in both marine and freshwater &lt;a href=\"Ecosystem\"&gt;environments&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"meiofauna\" loosely defines a group of &lt;a href=\"organism\"&gt;organism&lt;/a&gt;s by their \nsize, larger than microfauna but smaller than macrofauna, rather than a taxonomic grouping. One environment for meiofauna is between grains of damp sand (see &lt;a href=\"Mystacocarida\"&gt;Mystacocarida&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn practice these are metazoan animals that can pass unharmed through a 0.5 1\u00a0mm &lt;a href=\"mesh\"&gt;mesh&lt;/a&gt; but will be retained by a 30\u201345\u00a0\u03bcm mesh, but the exact dimensions will vary from &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;er to researcher. Whether an organism passes through a 1\u00a0mm mesh also depends upon whether it is alive or dead at the time of sorting.\nMesofauna.\n\"Mesofauna\" are macroscopic soil animals such as &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"nematode\"&gt;nematode&lt;/a&gt;s. Mesofauna are extremely diverse; considering just the springtails (&lt;a href=\"Collembola\"&gt;Collembola&lt;/a&gt;), as of 1998, approximately 6,500 species had been identified.\nMicrofauna.\nMicrofauna are microscopic or very small animals (usually including &lt;a href=\"protozoa\"&gt;protozoa&lt;/a&gt;ns and very small animals such as &lt;a href=\"rotifer\"&gt;rotifer&lt;/a&gt;s). To qualify as microfauna, an organism must exhibit animal-like characteristics, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"microflora\"&gt;microflora&lt;/a&gt;, which are more plant-like.\nStygofauna.\nStygofauna are any fauna that live in &lt;a href=\"groundwater\"&gt;groundwater&lt;/a&gt; systems or aquifers, such as &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, fissures and &lt;a href=\"vug\"&gt;vug&lt;/a&gt;s. Stygofauna and &lt;a href=\"troglofauna\"&gt;troglofauna&lt;/a&gt; are the two types of &lt;a href=\"subterranean%20fauna\"&gt;subterranean fauna&lt;/a&gt; (based on life-history). Both are associated with subterranean environments \u2013 stygofauna are associated with water, and troglofauna with caves and spaces above the &lt;a href=\"water%20table\"&gt;water table&lt;/a&gt;. Stygofauna can live within freshwater &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;s and within the &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Apore\"&gt;pore&lt;/a&gt; spaces of &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"calcrete\"&gt;calcrete&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"laterite\"&gt;laterite&lt;/a&gt;, whilst larger animals can be found in cave waters and wells. Stygofaunal animals, like troglofauna, are divided into three groups based on their life history - stygophiles, stygoxenes, and stygobites.\nTroglofauna.\nTroglofauna are small &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;-dwelling &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s that have &lt;a href=\"adaptation\"&gt;adapted&lt;/a&gt; to their dark surroundings. Troglofauna and &lt;a href=\"stygofauna\"&gt;stygofauna&lt;/a&gt; are the two types of &lt;a href=\"subterranean%20fauna\"&gt;subterranean fauna&lt;/a&gt; (based on life-history). Both are associated with subterranean environments \u2013 troglofauna are associated with caves and spaces above the water table and stygofauna with water. Troglofaunal species include &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"myriapods\"&gt;myriapods&lt;/a&gt; and others. Some troglofauna live permanently underground and cannot survive outside the cave environment. Troglofauna adaptations and characteristics include a heightened sense of hearing, touch and smell. Loss of under-used senses is apparent in the lack of pigmentation as well as eyesight in most troglofauna. Troglofauna insects may exhibit a lack of &lt;a href=\"insect%20wing\"&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt; and longer &lt;a href=\"appendage\"&gt;appendage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nXenofauna.\n&lt;a href=\"Drake%20equation\"&gt;Theoretically&lt;/a&gt;, \"Xenofauna\" are &lt;a href=\"Extraterrestrial%20life\"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; organisms that can be described as &lt;a href=\"Animal\"&gt;animal analogues&lt;/a&gt;. As of the current day, no alien life forms, animal or otherwise, are known to exist. Despite this, the idea of alien life remains a popular subject of interest in the fields of &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"astrobiology\"&gt;astrobiology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biochemistry\"&gt;biochemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"evolutionary%20biology\"&gt;evolutionary biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. \nOther.\nOther terms include \"&lt;a href=\"avifauna\"&gt;avifauna&lt;/a&gt;\", which means \"&lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; fauna\" and \"piscifauna\" (or \"&lt;a href=\"ichthyofauna\"&gt;ichthyofauna&lt;/a&gt;\"), which means \"&lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; fauna\"."
