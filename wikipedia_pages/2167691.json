    "text": "The Hong Kong Civil Service is managed by 13 policy bureaux in the &lt;a href=\"Government%20Secretariat%20%28Hong%20Kong%29\"&gt;Government Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, and 67 departments and agencies, mostly staffed by &lt;a href=\"civil%20servant\"&gt;civil servant&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20for%20the%20Civil%20Service\"&gt;Secretary for the Civil Service&lt;/a&gt; (SCS) is one of the Principal Officials appointed under the &lt;a href=\"Principal%20Officials%20Accountability%20System\"&gt;Accountability System&lt;/a&gt; and a Member of the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20of%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Executive Council&lt;/a&gt;. He heads the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Service%20Bureau\"&gt;Civil Service Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (CSB) of the Government Secretariat and is responsible to the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Executive%20of%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Chief Executive&lt;/a&gt; (CE) for civil service policies as well as the overall management and development of the civil service. His primary role is to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"civil%20service\"&gt;civil service&lt;/a&gt; serves the best interests of the community and delivers various services in a trustworthy, efficient and cost effective manner. The CSB assumes overall policy responsibility for the management of the civil service, including such matters as appointment, pay and conditions of service, &lt;a href=\"staff%20management\"&gt;staff management&lt;/a&gt;, manpower planning, training, and discipline.\nAppointment.\nAppointments to the civil service are based on open and fair competition. Candidates have to go through competitive appointment processes and are appointed only if they possess the qualifications and capabilities required for the job. Vacancies can be filled by promotion from within the service. In the case of basic ranks or where promotion is not possible or where there is a special need, vacancies are filled by open recruitment. To achieve the target of reducing the civil service establishment, the Government implemented a general recruitment freeze to the civil service with effect from 1 April 2003, with exemption granted only on very exceptional circumstances. Entry requirements for civil service posts in general are set on the basis of academic or professional qualifications obtainable from local institutions or professional bodies (or equivalent), technical skills, work experience, &lt;a href=\"language%20proficiency\"&gt;language proficiency&lt;/a&gt; and other qualities and attributes as required. To achieve the aim of a civil service which is biliterate (&lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;) and trilingual (generally conversant in spoken &lt;a href=\"Cantonese%20language\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;, English and &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Mandarin\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt;), language proficiency in Chinese and English is also required. From January 2003 onwards, for civil service posts requiring degree or professional qualifications, applicants should pass the two language papers (Use of Chinese and Use of English) in the Common Recruitment Examination before job application. For civil service posts with general academic qualifications set below degree level, applicants should attain at least Grade E in &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20Language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; (Syllabus B) in the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Certificate%20of%20Education%20Examination\"&gt;Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination&lt;/a&gt;, or equivalent. In accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Law%20of%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Basic Law&lt;/a&gt;, new recruits appointed on or after 1 July 1997 must be &lt;a href=\"permanent%20resident\"&gt;permanent resident&lt;/a&gt;s of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, save for certain specified exceptions.\nPromotion.\nOfficers are promoted on the criteria of character, ability, experience and prescribed qualifications. All eligible officers are considered on an equal basis. The officer selected for promotion must be the most meritorious one who is able and ready to perform duties at a higher rank.\nPublic Service Commission.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Civil%20service%20commission\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; is an independent statutory body responsible for advising the CE on civil service appointment, promotion and disciplinary matters. In practice, the advice is rendered to the SCS and the CSB deals with the commission on individual cases. The chairman and members of the commission are appointed by the CE. The commission seeks to ensure the &lt;a href=\"impartial\"&gt;impartial&lt;/a&gt;ity and fairness in appointments to the civil service and also advises on discipline matters. In accordance with the Public Service Commission Ordinance, advice of the commission has to be sought for appointment or promotion of officers to middle and senior ranking posts (excluding the disciplined ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Police%20Force\"&gt;Hong Kong Police Force&lt;/a&gt;). The commission is also consulted on changes in appointment procedures applicable to civil service posts.\nIndependent advisory bodies on pay and conditions of service.\nThree independent bodies advise the Government on matters relating to pay and conditions of service. Their members are selected from outside the Government.\nKey pay principles of civil service.\nThe objective of civil service pay is to offer sufficient remuneration to attract, retain, and motivate staff of suitable calibre to provide quality service to the public. Both civil servants and the general public should view the pay for civil service fair. Broad Comparability with the private sector is important when considering the pay for the civil servants. \u00a0This pay principle was sourced from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in 1953. In 1965, the Commission further suggested that the principle of fair comparison should be weighted the most among all other considerations, including internal relatives, which is being emphasised too much in the past, commented by the Task Force on the HKSAR Civil Service Pay System.\nTraining and development.\nJob-related training is arranged by departments while induction and grade-specific management training are generally provided by respective grade management. The CSB provides training and development support to departments through its Civil Service Training and Development Institute. There are four core service areas: senior executive development, national studies programmes, &lt;a href=\"human%20resources\"&gt;human resources&lt;/a&gt; management consultancy service and promotion of a continuous learning culture. Senior executive development programmes include leadership development and national studies programmes for directorate and potential directorate officers. Advisory services on Human Resources Development (HRD) and succession planning are also provided. National studies programmes include courses at Mainland institutes such as the &lt;a href=\"China%20National%20School%20of%20Administration\"&gt;National School of Administration&lt;/a&gt;, Foreign Affairs University, &lt;a href=\"Tsinghua%20University\"&gt;Tsinghua University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peking%20University\"&gt;Peking University&lt;/a&gt;. There are also local programmes on national affairs and the Basic &lt;a href=\"Law\"&gt;Law&lt;/a&gt;, as well as staff exchange programme with the Mainland. An e-learning portal, the Cyber Learning Centre Plus is intended to promote a continuous learning culture. The Institute also disseminates best practices in HRD through its advisory services in training needs analysis, learning strategies, development of competency profiles, and performance management systems.\nPerformance management.\nThrough the &lt;a href=\"performance%20appraisal\"&gt;performance appraisal&lt;/a&gt; process, staff at different levels are made aware of the standard of performance expected of them. Management of the process helps maximise individual performance and enhance the corporate efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service as a whole. As an integral part of the overall human resource management functions, it is a major tool in human resource planning (e.g. succession planning), development (e.g. training and job rotation), and management (e.g. confirmation, promotion, posting and disciplinary action). Performance appraisal of staff is an ongoing process. Appraisal reports are normally completed annually. Transparency and objectivity of the appraisal process are also emphasised. To improve the system, department management is encouraged to put in place assessment panels to undertake levelling and moderating work among appraisal reports, identify under-performers/outstanding performers for appropriate action, adopt other management tools including target-based assessment and core competencies assessment. The Long and Meritorious Service Travel Award Scheme, the Long and Meritorious Service Award Scheme and the &lt;a href=\"Retirement\"&gt;Retirement&lt;/a&gt; Souvenir Scheme provide additional rewards. A commendation system also exists to give recognition to exemplary performance.\nStaff discipline.\n&lt;a href=\"Discipline\"&gt;Disciplinary&lt;/a&gt; action may be taken against an act of misconduct to achieve a punitive, rehabilitative and deterrent effect.\nStaff relations.\nThere is both a central and a departmental staff consultative machinery. Centrally, there are the Senior Civil Service Council, the Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council, the Police Force Council, and the Disciplined Services Consultative Council. Through these channels, the Government consults its staff on any major changes, which affect their conditions of service. At the departmental level, there are Departmental Consultative Committees which aim to improve co-operation and understanding between management and staff through regular exchanges of views. There are established channels to deal with staff &lt;a href=\"grievance%20%28labour%29\"&gt;grievances&lt;/a&gt; and complaints. Individual members of staff with problems can receive counselling, advice and help. A Staff Suggestions Scheme is run by both the CSB and departments to encourage staff to make suggestions for improving the efficiency of the civil service. Awards are given to those whose suggestions are found useful. A Staff Welfare Fund caters for the interests of staff. A Staff Relief Fund provides assistance to meet unforeseen financial needs to staff."
