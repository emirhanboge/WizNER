    "text": "The coat of arms of Norway is the &lt;a href=\"arms%20of%20dominion\"&gt;arms of dominion&lt;/a&gt; of king &lt;a href=\"Harald%20V%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Harald V of Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and as such represents both the monarch and the &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (nation and the state). It depicts a standing &lt;a href=\"Or%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;golden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lion%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Gules\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; background, bearing a golden crown and axe with silver blade (&lt;a href=\"blazon\"&gt;blazon&lt;/a&gt;ed \"Gules, a lion rampant Or, crowned Or, holding an axe Or with a blade argent\").\nThe coat of arms is used by the &lt;a href=\"king%20of%20Norway\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; (including the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Norway\"&gt;King's Council&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Storting\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, which are the three powers according to the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. It is also used by several national, regional, and local authorities that are subordinate to the aforementioned, for example the County Governors and both the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20of%20Norway\"&gt;district courts and the courts of appeal&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1905, two parallel versions exist: the more elaborate version used by the King and the simpler one used by the State. The arms in &lt;a href=\"banner%20of%20arms\"&gt;banner form&lt;/a&gt; serve as basis for the monarch's flag, known as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Standard%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Royal Standard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, there are former and existing lands (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Iceland\"&gt;Earldom of Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orkney\"&gt;Orkney&lt;/a&gt; Islands), cities (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt;), organisations (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Museum%20of%20Cultural%20History\"&gt;Museum of Cultural History&lt;/a&gt;), companies (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Adresseavisen\"&gt;Adresseavisen&lt;/a&gt;), and families (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Gyldenl%C3%B8ve\"&gt;Counts of Gyldenl\u00f8ve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gudbrand%20Gregersen%20de%20Sa%C3%A1g\"&gt;Gudbrand Gregersen&lt;/a&gt;) who have been granted the right to bear the coat of arms or derivations of this. Unless officially granted, it is illegal to use the coat of arms.\nThe arms has its origin in the 13th century, at first just as a golden lion on a red shield, with the silver axe added late in the century, symbolising &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20II%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Olaf II&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Rex%20Perpetuus%20Norvegiae\"&gt;Eternal King of Norway&lt;/a&gt;. In origin the arms of the &lt;a href=\"Sverre%20dynasty\"&gt;Sverre dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the coat of arms became &lt;a href=\"Quartering%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;quartered&lt;/a&gt; with that of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bj%C3%A4lbo\"&gt;Bj\u00e4lbo dynasty&lt;/a&gt; when the Sverre lineage was extinct in 1319, and the Sverre coat of arms figured as part of the further &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20the%20field\"&gt;divisions&lt;/a&gt; of the coats of arms of Norwegian kings during the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Sverre coat of arms was regarded as representing the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20monarchy\"&gt;Norwegian monarchy&lt;/a&gt; in the late 15th century, and it came to be used to represent Norway on coins and in seals during the &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; with Denmark (1523\u22121814) and the 19th-century &lt;a href=\"Union%20between%20Sweden%20and%20Norway\"&gt;personal union with Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, its 13th-century origins placing it among the oldest state coats of arms which remain in contemporary use. The axe tended to be depicted as a curved &lt;a href=\"pollaxe\"&gt;pollaxe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; from 1500 until 1844. The 1844 design approved by king &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20I%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Oscar I&lt;/a&gt; reverted to the depiction of a &lt;a href=\"battle-axe\"&gt;battle-axe&lt;/a&gt; as shown in medieval designs. \nAfter the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905 a medieval-type escutcheon and charge was designed by &lt;a href=\"Eilif%20Peterssen\"&gt;Eilif Peterssen&lt;/a&gt;. Peterssen's design would be used until 1937 when it was re-designed by state archivist &lt;a href=\"Hallvard%20Tr%C3%A6tteberg\"&gt;Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a markedly different, more simplified design style. Peterssen's design has, however, been retained in the Royal Standard and coat of arms.\nUsage.\nRoyal decree of 20 May 1927 states: The coat of arms of the Realm may be used only by the state's authorities in the exercise of their official activity. The coat of arms may be used by the Royal Court, by the government and its ministries, by the parliament, by the law courts, and by some others. Matters of the coat of arms are treated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The state coat of arms has no achievement save the surmounting crown.\nThe royal coat of arms is defined in the resolution of 30 December 1905. In the coat of arms of the realm, a heraldic royal crown is placed directly on top of the shield. In the royal coat of arms, the shield of the arms of the realm is on a mantle &lt;a href=\"purple\"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; lined &lt;a href=\"Ermine%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;ermine&lt;/a&gt; with a royal crown on top. Three sides of the shield are surrounded by the collar of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Order%20of%20St%20Olav\"&gt;Royal Order of St. Olaf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following coats of arms are displayed with the collar of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St.%20Olaf\"&gt;Order of St. Olaf&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all Princes and Princesses are Grand Cross holders or, for that sake, members of this order at all, wherefore their respective coats of arms do not include this &lt;a href=\"Achievement%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Standard%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Royal Standard of Norway&lt;/a&gt; is the Norwegian arms in &lt;a href=\"banner%20of%20arms\"&gt;banner form&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements including the royal arms:\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe design of the coat of arms is derived from that of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Sverre\"&gt;Sverre dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hallvard%20Tr%C3%A6tteberg\"&gt;Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg&lt;/a&gt; in 1814 suggested that &lt;a href=\"Sverre%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Sverre&lt;/a&gt;, who was king between 1184 and 1202, had a lion in his coat of arms, although there is no direct attestation. Snorre Sturlason claims that a golden lion on a red background was used already in 1103 by King Magnus III, the son of King Olav III. &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Storm\"&gt;Gustav Storm&lt;/a&gt; in 1894 concluded that this is ahistorical. Storm explained that the claimed lion in King Magnus's coat of arms is unknown both in the older &lt;a href=\"Saga\"&gt;Saga&lt;/a&gt; literature and in other contemporary sources. It is possible that Snorre, who wrote under the instruction of the King, attributed King Sverre's coat of arms to earlier Kings of Norway.\nA lion is shown on the coat of arms in the seal of Earl Skule B\u00e5rdsson, dated 1225, who had relations to the royal family. \n&lt;a href=\"Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Haakon Haakonson the Old&lt;/a&gt; had a lion in his seal, shown as lying between the feet of the seated king.\nA royal coat of arms with a lion is finally seen on the seal of &lt;a href=\"Haakon%20the%20Young\"&gt;Haakon Haakonson the Young&lt;/a&gt;, dated 1250.\nThe first instance of the lion bearing an axe is found in a seal of &lt;a href=\"Eric%20II%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Eric II&lt;/a&gt; (1285).\nMedieval seals.\nApproximately in 1280, either King Magnus VI (dead in 1280) or the guardianship of his son Eric Magnuson let the lion be equipped with a crown of gold and in the foremost paws an axe of silver. The axe was a symbol of Saint Olaf, i.e. King Olaf II, and by inserting it into the coat of arms it symbolised that the King was the rightful heir and descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Rex%20Perpetuus%20Norvegiae\"&gt;'Eternal King of Norway'&lt;/a&gt; (Latin: \"Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae\").\nLate medieval coats of arms.\nWith the death of King &lt;a href=\"Haakon%20V%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Haakon V&lt;/a&gt; in 1319, the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Sverre%20dynasty\"&gt;Sverre dynasty&lt;/a&gt; came to an end. The Throne and thus the Royal Coat of Arms was inherited by Magnus VII, who was a maternal grandson of Haakon V and who himself belonged patrilineally to the family known as the Bj\u00e4lbo dynasty.\nSubsequently, Norway remained in &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; with neighbouring countries. When acting as the ruler of one particular country, the sovereign would normally use the arms of that kingdom. When acting as sovereign of the united kingdoms, he would &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20the%20field\"&gt;marshal&lt;/a&gt; the escutcheon by &lt;a href=\"Quartering%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;quartering&lt;/a&gt;. This was a tendency in Europe in general.\nThe first union kings placed the Royal Coat of Arms in the first quarter of the quartered coat of arms. At the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20Union\"&gt;Kalmar Union&lt;/a&gt;, Norway as a hereditary kingdom was considered more important than Sweden and Denmark, which were still electoral kingdoms. Consequently, King Eric III of &lt;a href=\"Pomerania\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt; placed his Norwegian Coat of Arms in an &lt;a href=\"Escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;inescutcheon&lt;/a&gt;, superimposed on the coats of arms of his other realms. However, the Norwegian Coat of Arms would later be degraded, so that the &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Coat of arms of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; would occupy the first field, whilst Norway's was placed in the second.\nMarshalled versions from 1450 until 1814.\nIn 1450, Count &lt;a href=\"Christian%20I%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Delmenhorst\"&gt;Delmenhorst&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Norway\"&gt;King of Norway&lt;/a&gt;. He was already &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;King of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; since 1448, and in 1457, he became &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;King of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; as well. Norway's coat of arms was placed in the lower dexter field and, when &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20Union\"&gt;Kalmar Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1523, in the upper sinister field. The latter lasted until 1814.\nVarying from time to time, the Kings between 1450 and 1814 bore the coats of arms of the following kingdoms, peoples, and lands:\nMarshalled versions from 1814 until 1905.\nOn 4 November 1814, the Norwegian &lt;a href=\"Storting\"&gt;Storting&lt;/a&gt; elected King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XIII%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Charles XIII of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; as King of Norway. This &lt;a href=\"Union%20between%20Sweden%20and%20Norway\"&gt;personal union with Sweden&lt;/a&gt; lasted until the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20union%20between%20Norway%20and%20Sweden\"&gt;dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in 1905.\nWithout legitimate &lt;a href=\"heirs%20of%20the%20body\"&gt;heirs of the body&lt;/a&gt;, King Charles adopted the French marshall Bernadotte, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XIV%20John%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Prince of Pontecorvo&lt;/a&gt;, who took the name Carl Johan. \nThe union arms introduced by King Charles XIII and Crown Prince Carl Johan were never used officially in Norway. Only the lion coat of arms of Norway appeared on coins and on seals of official documents signed by the King in his capacity as Norwegian king.\nThe union arms introduced by King Oscar I in 1844 was used by members of the royal family, by the common diplomatic service of both kingdoms, and on official documents concerning both countries. In Norway, the union arms was never used on coins or official documents.\nIn Sweden, Crown Princes and Princes bore the coat of arms belonging to his duchy. See &lt;a href=\"Duchies%20in%20Sweden\"&gt;Duchies in Sweden&lt;/a&gt; (but these titles and arms were never used in Norway).\nSince 1814.\nThe halberd was officially discarded and the shorter axe reintroduced by Royal Order in Council 10 July 1844, when an authorised design was instituted for the first time. On 14 December 1905 the official design for royal and government arms was again changed, this time reverting to the medieval pattern, with a triangular escutcheon and a more upright heraldic lion. The painter &lt;a href=\"Eilif%20Peterssen\"&gt;Eilif Peterssen&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the design.\nThrough centuries and following changing fashions in heraldry and arts, the coat of arms has appeared in several ways in the matter of design, shape, and so on. In the late &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the axe handle gradually grew longer and came to resemble a &lt;a href=\"halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt;. The handle was usually curved in order to fit the shape of the escutcheon (or the changing union &lt;a href=\"Quartering%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;quarterings&lt;/a&gt;) preferred at the time, and also to match the shape of coins.\nThe coat of arms has also been used by subordinate state authorities and in semi-official contexts, such as on bank-notes."
