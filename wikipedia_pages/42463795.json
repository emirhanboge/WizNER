    "text": " is a Japanese former professional baseball relief pitcher who played in the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; minor league system in 1998. He is notable for being the first Japanese player to sign directly with a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; organization without playing any professional baseball in &lt;a href=\"baseball%20in%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter attending Omagari Kogyo High School in &lt;a href=\"Akita%20Prefecture\"&gt;Akita Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, Ushiromatsu signed with New York in November 1997 at the urging of scout Isao Ojimi when he was 18 years old. The 6' 1\", 165 pound left-handed pitcher, who was bypassed in Japan's amateur draft, signed for a bonus of about $100,000. He pitched for the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20Mets\"&gt;Gulf Coast Mets&lt;/a&gt; that season - his only professional campaign in the United States - and went 0-2 with a 4.85 ERA in 16 relief appearances. His professional career ended prematurely after he injured his back in a car accident."
