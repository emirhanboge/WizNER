They were later re-equipped with &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Seal\"&gt;Fairey Seal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Shark\"&gt;Blackburn Shark&lt;/a&gt;s, eventually receiving &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Swordfish\"&gt;Fairey Swordfish&lt;/a&gt; in autumn 1937. The squadron was reassigned in November the following year to the new aircraft carrier . The squadron operated from \"Ark Royal\" for the next three years, initially on anti-submarine duties, but later as surface search and torpedo-attack aircraft. The squadron went with \"Ark Royal\" to the Atlantic, and by April 1940 they were supporting &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; operations during the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung\"&gt;Norwegian campaign&lt;/a&gt;, where they bombed &lt;a href=\"Vaernes\"&gt;Vaernes&lt;/a&gt; airfield. After the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Alphabet\"&gt;withdrawal from Norway&lt;/a&gt;, \"Ark Royal\" and the squadron moved to the Mediterranean in June. Aircraft from 820 squadron were involved in attacking the French fleet at &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir\"&gt;Mers-el-K\u00e9bir&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dakar\"&gt;Battle of Dakar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as attacks at &lt;a href=\"Cagliari\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt;. They were also active during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartivento\"&gt;Battle of Cape Spartivento&lt;/a&gt;, as well as covering &lt;a href=\"Malta%20Convoys\"&gt;convoys to Malta&lt;/a&gt;.\n820 Squadron's next major engagement was the hunt for the German &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; . Aircraft from the squadron were able to disable \"Bismarck\"s steering gear with a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; hit, allowing \"Bismarck\" to be &lt;a href=\"last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck\"&gt;engaged and sunk&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1941 the squadron left \"Ark Royal\", and in November that year returned to &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; aboard . The Swordfish were then replaced with &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Albacore\"&gt;Fairey Albacore&lt;/a&gt;s. 820 Squadron then embarked aboard in February 1942, and sailed with \"Formidable\" to serve in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron was then active in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Madagascar\"&gt;Battle of Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Torch\"&gt;Operation Torch&lt;/a&gt;, the Allied landings in &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;. During these operations, aircraft from the squadron sank , which had earlier sunk the battleship . \"Formidable\" and the squadron remained in the Mediterranean to provide support for the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Allied landings at Sicily&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Salerno&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe squadron then returned to the UK in November 1943 and disbanded at &lt;a href=\"Donibristle\"&gt;RNAS Donibristle&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron was quickly reformed however, and equipped with 12 &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Barracuda\"&gt;Fairey Barracuda&lt;/a&gt;s was initially based at &lt;a href=\"RNAS%20Lee-on-Solent%20%28HMS%20Daedalus%29\"&gt;RNAS Lee-on-Solent&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; squadron. They were assigned to in June 1944 and saw action as part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Mascot\"&gt;Operation Mascot&lt;/a&gt; on 17 July and &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29\"&gt;Operations Goodwood&lt;/a&gt; in August, the attempts to sink the in Kaa Fjord, &lt;a href=\"Alta%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Alta, Norway&lt;/a&gt;. The operations failed to cause significant damage to \"Tirpitz\". The squadron was re-equipped with 21 &lt;a href=\"Grumman%20Avenger\"&gt;Grumman Avenger&lt;/a&gt;s in September 1944 and sailed with \"Indefatigable\" to the Far East in November. They sailed to &lt;a href=\"Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; where 820 squadron joined No 2 Strike Wing, which also consisted of &lt;a href=\"849%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron\"&gt;849 Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. The Wing attacked the oil refineries at &lt;a href=\"Palembang\"&gt;Palembang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; in January 1945 as part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Meridian\"&gt;Operation Meridian&lt;/a&gt;, following this up with later strikes on the Sakashima Gunto islands. As the war in the Pacific moved closer to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; 820 Squadron was assigned to the 7th Carrier Air Group, and carried out a number of raids on &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"VJ-Day\"&gt;VJ-Day&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the war, \"Indefatigable\" remained in the Pacific for some time, finally returning to the UK in March 1946. 820 Squadron was then disbanded again.\nPost war.\nThe squadron was re-formed five years later in July 1951, this time flying the &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Firefly\"&gt;Fairey Firefly&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron was embarked alternately aboard the carriers and during 1952 and 1953, spending most of its time on exercises in the Mediterranean. The squadron operated the Grumman Avenger and then the &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Gannet\"&gt;Fairey Gannet&lt;/a&gt; during 1954 and 1956, aboard and , before the decision was made to convert 820 Squadron as a &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; squadron. 820 disbanded on 2 December 1957 but were immediately re-formed the same day at , equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Westland%20Whirlwind%20%28helicopter%29\"&gt;Westland Whirlwind HAS.7&lt;/a&gt;. They were assigned to in May 1958 as an anti-submarine and commando support force, remaining aboard \"Hermes\" until October 1960, when the squadron was again disbanded.\nThe squadron was re-formed in 1964, and equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Westland%20Wessex\"&gt;Westland Wessex HAS.1&lt;/a&gt;, with which they served as anti-submarine squadron aboard . They were upgraded to the Westland Wessex HAS.3 in May 1969, when they were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Tiger-class%20cruiser\"&gt;\"Tiger\"-class helicopter cruiser&lt;/a&gt; . They remained aboard \"Blake\" until her disposal in 1979, the squadron was then assigned to HMS \"Hermes\" for the first quarter of 1980. The squadrons aircraft had been upgraded with the &lt;a href=\"Westland%20Sea%20King\"&gt;Westland Sea King HAS.1&lt;/a&gt; in December 1972, followed by the HAS.2 version and then the HS.Mk.5 in December 1980. It was then assigned to in early 1981; on 6 March 1981 the squadron suffered a tragedy when two of its aircraft had a mid-air collision, five of the eight crew members were killed.\nIn April 1982 the squadron remained embarked for the &lt;a href=\"Falklands%20War\"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict the squadron flew over 4700 hours, with \"Invincible\" spending 166 days continuously at sea, setting a &lt;a href=\"world%20record\"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; for continuous carrier operations. The squadron transferred to in late 1985. They were re-equipped in February 1990 with the Sea King MK6 and on board \"Ark Royal\" were dispatched to the Eastern Mediterranean on 10 January 1991, with the intention of transiting the Suez Canal, so they would be in the Red Sea for Operation Granby \u2013 UK name for Desert Storm. However, the war started before they could transit the Suez Canal, and instead, Ark Royal, remained in the Eastern Mediterranean for the duration of the War. In January 1993, 820 were dispatched aboard and\n&lt;a href=\"RFA%20Fort%20Rosalie%20%28A385%29\"&gt;RFA \"Fort Grange\"&lt;/a&gt; to support the British forces in &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Grapple%20%28Yugoslavia%29\"&gt;Operation Grapple&lt;/a&gt;. There the squadron was used to ferry men and supplies. 820 Squadron returned to Bosnia in 1994, this time aboard HMS \"Ark Royal\". With the later decommissioning of \"Ark Royal\", the squadron joined and by 1996 was in the eastern Atlantic, followed by a round the world deployment in 1997.\nWith \"Illustrious\" in refit from 1998, 820 Squadron operated out of &lt;a href=\"RNAS%20Culdrose%20%28HMS%20Seahawk%29\"&gt;RNAS Culdrose&lt;/a&gt; on anti-submarine training exercises, followed with periods embarked on ships of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary\"&gt;Royal Fleet Auxiliary&lt;/a&gt;. They rejoined \"Illustrious\" in 1999 and participated in relief operations in &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, aboard , and for &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Palliser\"&gt;Operation Palliser&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone\"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;. Further training periods followed, as well as a Search and Rescue effort in October 2004 to aid the stricken Canadian submarine , which had been disabled after suffering a fire and flooding off the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresent day.\nThe squadron continues to carry out exercises aboard Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, as well as participating in military operations. It is based at RNAS Culdrose and operates the &lt;a href=\"AgustaWestland%20EH101\"&gt;AgustaWestland Merlin HM.2&lt;/a&gt;. Training is performed by &lt;a href=\"824%20NAS\"&gt;824 NAS&lt;/a&gt; and front line duties are shared with &lt;a href=\"814%20NAS\"&gt;814 NAS&lt;/a&gt;. During 2014, 820 NAS was temporarily assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Commando%20Helicopter%20Force\"&gt;Commando Helicopter Force&lt;/a&gt; until the two main troop carrying squadrons fully convert to the Merlin HC.4.\n820 NAS is also known as the \"Queen's squadron\" and will be the main squadron to operate on the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier.\n 3 Merlins from 820 NAS were deployed off as the UK's response towards the 2014 Ebola virus. 820 NAS will be permanently attached to HMS \"Queen Elizabeth\"s air group. On 3 July 2017, a Merlin Mk.2 helicopter of 820 NAS became the first aircraft to land on HMS \"Queen Elizabeth\", piloted by 26-year-old Lieutenant Luke Wraith from Yorkshire.\nIn 2020, 820 NAS assumed responsibility for all Merlin HM.2 operations from the Royal Navy's carriers, when it took over the Airborne Surveillance role from &lt;a href=\"849%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron\"&gt;849 NAS&lt;/a&gt;. This will see a number of its aircraft installed with the Crowsnest system, consisting of a new version of the &lt;a href=\"Searchwater\"&gt;Searchwater&lt;/a&gt; radar combined with Cerberus mission system in a kit installation. This is to allow the system to be installed in any Merlin airframe."
