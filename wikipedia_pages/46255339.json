    "text": "Jozo Penava (26 May 1909 \u2013 17 January 1987) was a Bosnian music producer, composer, arranger, musician and vocalist. Penava immensely contributed to the development of folk songs and the traditional &lt;a href=\"Bosniak\"&gt;Bosniak&lt;/a&gt; folk music &lt;a href=\"sevdalinka\"&gt;sevdalinka&lt;/a&gt;. He worked with many prominent sevdalinka singers of the 20th century, such as &lt;a href=\"Safet%20Isovi%C4%87\"&gt;Safet Isovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zehra%20Deovi%C4%87\"&gt;Zehra Deovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Himzo%20Polovina\"&gt;Himzo Polovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nada%20Mamula\"&gt;Nada Mamula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beba%20Selimovi%C4%87\"&gt;Beba Selimovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, Ned\u017ead Salkovi\u0107, &lt;a href=\"Silvana%20Armenuli%C4%87\"&gt;Silvana Armenuli\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meho%20Puzi%C4%87\"&gt;Meho Puzi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nBiography.\nPenava was born in the village of &lt;a href=\"Gornji%20Pale%C5%BE\"&gt;Pale\u017e&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kiseljak\"&gt;Kiseljak&lt;/a&gt;, in what is today &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. As a young man he studied to become a &lt;a href=\"baker\"&gt;baker&lt;/a&gt;. Penava was in love with the craft of baking, but was never attracted to getting up early and working in high temperature kitchens. His passion for music was stronger. After serving his military service in &lt;a href=\"Sombor\"&gt;Sombor&lt;/a&gt; in 1939, Penava composed his first songs: \"Sa prozora\" (\"From the Window\") and \"U ba\u0161tici, kraj bijele ru\u017eice\" (\"In a Small Garden, by the White Roses\"). He enrolled in a music school where he gained musical knowledge. Penava was one of the founders of Radio Sarajevo in April 1945 after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Penava led the &lt;a href=\"tamburica\"&gt;tambura&lt;/a&gt; orchestra of Radio Sarajevo for more than twenty years."
