    "text": "The 2010\u201311 &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt; was the 77th season of the highest level of &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; leagues in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; since its establishment in 1927. It began on 6 August 2010 and concluded on 29 May 2011. A total of 16 teams participated, 14 of which competed in the league during the 2009\u201310 season, while the remaining two were promoted from the &lt;a href=\"I%20Liga%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;I Liga&lt;/a&gt;. Each team played a total of 30 matches, half at home and half away.\n&lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; won the title, which marked their 13th title in total.\n&lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; qualified as champions for the 2nd qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt;, as the runner-up, entered the 2nd qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the fourth placed &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt; team that earned a place in the 1st qualifying round of the Europa League. &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, the winner of the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Polish%20Cup\"&gt;2010\u201311 Polish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, also earned a place in European competition by qualifying to the 3rd qualifying round of the Europa League.\nThe defending champions were &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, who won their sixth Polish championship &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeams.\nPromotion and relegation was established by a change, which eliminated relegation play-off games after the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; season. Thus, the 14th team from the Ekstraklasa and the 3rd team from the Polish First League no longer competed against each other in play-offs. Following the change, promotion and relegation were determined solely by a team's position in the table. As usual, the bottom two teams were directly relegated to the &lt;a href=\"I%20Liga%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;I Liga&lt;/a&gt;, while the top two teams were promoted to the Ekstraklasa.\n&lt;a href=\"Odra%20Wodzis%C5%82aw\"&gt;Odra Wodzis\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piast%20Gliwice\"&gt;Piast Gliwice&lt;/a&gt; finished in 15th and 16th place, respectively, and were directly relegated to the Polish First League as a result. &lt;a href=\"Odra%20Wodzis%C5%82aw\"&gt;Odra Wodzis\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; returned to the second tier after spending 14 years in the top division, their first appearance being in the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;1996\u201397&lt;/a&gt; season. Piast Gliwice spent just two seasons in the &lt;a href=\"Ekstraklasa\"&gt;Ekstraklasa&lt;/a&gt;, after being promoted for the first time for the 2008\u201309 season, having spent the previous 71 seasons in the lower leagues.\nPromotion was won by &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Polish%20First%20League\"&gt;2009\u201310 2nd level&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href=\"Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to the top division after being relegated in the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Ekstraklasa\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season. 14-time Ekstraklasa champions &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze\"&gt;G\u00f3rnik Zabrze&lt;/a&gt; finished as runners-up in the I Liga and made their comeback to the top tier after being relegated in the 2008\u201309 season.\nStadiums and locations.\nSince and prior to the selection of Poland as co-host for &lt;a href=\"2012%20UEFA%20Euro\"&gt;Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt;, numerous clubs were engaged in reconstruction of their stadiums, or building a completely new stadium. Some teams in the beginning of the season played their home matches in other stadiums. For instance &lt;a href=\"Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; played their home matches at the &lt;a href=\"Hutnik%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Hutnik Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; stadium, the &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Suche%20Stawy\"&gt;Stadion Suche Stawy&lt;/a&gt;, which held 12,000 spectators. However, the move to the nearly completed 33,000-plus home stadium was in effect mid-season. &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Lech Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; played at stadiums which remained under construction but nearing completion. &lt;a href=\"Dialog%20Arena\"&gt;Dialog Arena&lt;/a&gt;, the home venue of &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Lubin\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Lubin&lt;/a&gt; was the newest completely finished stadium in the Ekstraklasa these season, being completed just before the start of the season.\n&lt;a href=\"Arka%20Gdynia\"&gt;Arka Gdynia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cracovia%20%28football%20club%29\"&gt;Cracovia&lt;/a&gt; started the season playing in their old stadiums. The two clubs moved to their completely finished new stadiums mid season. &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lechia%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Lechia Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; played in their old stadiums while their new venues were being constructed. The 40,000 plus &lt;a href=\"PGE%20Arena%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;PGE Arena Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt; became the new home ground for Lechia after its completion in 2011, while \u015al\u0105sk moved to the new 45,000 plus &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20Miejski%20%28Wroc%C5%82aw%29\"&gt;Stadion Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt;. The two stadiums were venues for Euro 2012.\nSponsoring and personnel.\n&lt;a href=\"Puma%20AG\"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt; continues as Ekstraklasa's official match ball suppliers through the 2010\u201311 season. All matches are played with the PUMA PowerCat 1.10 ultra balls, which is a special model created just for the Ekstraklasa.\nThe official presentation of the new ball for Ekstraklasa was prepared together with PUMA Poland in the beginning of August 2010 \u2013 just before the start of season. The case of prolonging the use of the match ball for the next two seasons was made official on 3 August 2010. The new model will be used through the 2011\u201312 season as it is regarded at the highest quality .\nLeague table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPlayer statistics.\nTop goalscorers.\n\"Source: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.today/20130416090328/http%3A//sport.onet.pl/74318%2C1248685%2C11619%2Ctabela.html%3Ftab%3D9184\"&gt;onet.pl&lt;/a&gt;\nTop assistants.\n\"Source:\""
