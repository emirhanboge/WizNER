    "text": "This is a list of the 41 cases reported in volume 37 (12 Pet.) of \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Reports\"&gt;United States Reports&lt;/a&gt;\", decided by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; from January 1838 to March 1838.\nNominative reports.\nIn 1874, the U.S. government created the \"United States Reports\", and retroactively numbered older privately-published &lt;a href=\"Law%20report\"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; as part of the new series. As a result, cases appearing in volumes 1\u201390 of \"U.S. Reports\" have dual &lt;a href=\"Case%20citation\"&gt;citation forms&lt;/a&gt;; one for the volume number of \"U.S. Reports\", and one for the volume number of the reports named for the relevant reporter of decisions (these are called \"&lt;a href=\"Nominate%20reports\"&gt;nominative reports&lt;/a&gt;\").\nRichard Peters, Jr..\nStarting with the 26th volume of \"U.S. Reports\", the &lt;a href=\"Reporter%20of%20Decisions%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Peters%20%28reporter%29\"&gt;Richard Peters, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; Peters was Reporter of Decisions from 1828 to 1843, covering volumes 26 through 41 of \"United States Reports\" which correspond to volumes 1 through 16 of his \"Peter's Reports\". As such, the dual form of citation to, for example, \"United States v. Coombs\" is 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 72 (1838).\nJustices of the Supreme Court at the time of 37 U.S. (12 Pet.).\nThe Supreme Court is established by &lt;a href=\"Article%20Three%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Article III, Section 1&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Constitution of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which says: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . .\". The size of the Court is not specified; the Constitution leaves it to &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to set the number of justices. Under the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; Congress originally fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices). Since 1789 Congress has varied the size of the Court from six to &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201807\"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20and%20Ninth%20Circuits%20Act%20of%201837\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201863\"&gt;ten&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201869\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; justices (always including one chief justice). When the cases in 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) were decided, the Court for the first time comprised nine justices, its membership having been expanded under the &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20and%20Ninth%20Circuits%20Act%20of%201837\"&gt;Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act of 1837&lt;/a&gt;; they were:\nNotable Case in 37 U.S. (12 Pet.).\n\"Rhode Island v. Massachusetts\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island%20v.%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Rhode Island v. Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.courtlistener.com/opinion/86064/the-state-of-rhode-island-v-the-state-of-massachusetts/%3Fq%3D%252237%2520U.S.%2522%2520Rhode%26amp%3Btype%3Do%26amp%3Border_by%3Dscore%2520desc%26amp%3Bstat_Precedential%3Don%26amp%3Bfiled_after%3D01%252F01%252F1837%26amp%3Bfiled_before%3D01%252F01%252F1839%26amp%3Bcourt%3Dscotus\"&gt;37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 755 (1838)&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court asserted its &lt;a href=\"original%20jurisdiction\"&gt;original jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; in a case involving one state against another over their shared border. The case involved a boundary dispute between &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; dating back to colonial times. &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Webster\"&gt;Daniel Webster&lt;/a&gt; was involved in the case, representing Massachusetts.\nCitation style.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; the federal court structure at the time comprised District Courts, which had general trial jurisdiction; Circuit Courts, which had mixed trial and appellate (from the US District Courts) jurisdiction; and the United States Supreme Court, which had appellate jurisdiction over the federal District and Circuit courts\u2014and for certain issues over state courts. The Supreme Court also had limited &lt;a href=\"Original%20jurisdiction\"&gt;original jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; (\"i.e.,\" in which cases could be filed directly with the Supreme Court without first having been heard by a lower federal or state court). There were one or more federal District Courts and/or Circuit Courts in each state, territory, or other geographical region.\n&lt;a href=\"Bluebook\"&gt;Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; citation style is used for case names, citations, and jurisdictions.
