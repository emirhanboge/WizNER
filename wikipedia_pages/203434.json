Founded as Stoke Ramblers in 1863, the club changed its name to Stoke Football Club in 1878 and then to Stoke City in 1925 after Stoke-on-Trent was granted &lt;a href=\"City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;city status&lt;/a&gt;. Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League\"&gt;1888&lt;/a&gt;. The team competes in the &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt;, the second tier of &lt;a href=\"English%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;English football&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir first, and only major trophy to date, the &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; was won in &lt;a href=\"1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;, when the team beat &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131. The club's highest league finish in the top division is fourth, which was achieved in the &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1935\u201336&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1946%E2%80%9347%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1946\u201347&lt;/a&gt; seasons. Stoke played in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, finishing runners-up to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; and have reached three &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20semi-finals\"&gt;FA Cup semi-finals&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href=\"1898%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1899&lt;/a&gt; then consecutively in &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;. Stoke have &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football\"&gt;competed in European football&lt;/a&gt; on three occasions, firstly in &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1972\u201373&lt;/a&gt; then in &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt; and most recently in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt;.

Before the stadium was opened in 1997, the club was based at the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt;, which had been their home ground since 1878. The club's nickname is 'The Potters', named after the &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire%20Potteries\"&gt;pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt; and their traditional home kit is a red and white vertically striped shirt, white shorts and stockings. Stoke's traditional rivals are Midlands clubs &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; whilst their local rivals are &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; with whom they contest the &lt;a href=\"Potteries%20derby\"&gt;Potteries derby&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation and the early years (1863\u20131919).\nStoke City was founded during the 1860s under the title of Stoke Ramblers, often claimed to have been in 1863. According to the club's official history, in that year former pupils of &lt;a href=\"Charterhouse%20School\"&gt;Charterhouse School&lt;/a&gt; formed a football club while they were apprentices at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Staffordshire%20Railway\"&gt;North Staffordshire Railway&lt;/a&gt; works in &lt;a href=\"Stoke-upon-Trent\"&gt;Stoke-upon-Trent&lt;/a&gt;. However, there has been a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the origins of the club and the precise year that it was established. Whilst Stoke City officially claim to have been formed in 1863, the year used on the club crest, research has demonstrated that the club was actually more likely formed in 1868, five years later than previously thought.\nStoke Ramblers were formed in 1868 by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Almond\"&gt;Henry Almond&lt;/a&gt; who had been a student at Charterhouse school where a dribbling form of the game was popular. He arrived in the region to become an apprentice with the North Staffordshire Railway Company and, wishing to continue playing the game that he had enjoyed whilst at school, established the first formal association football club in the region. The club's first documented match was in October 1868, against a scratch team brought together for the occasion by E.W May. Harry Almond captained the Stoke Ramblers team and also scored the club's first goal. The club's first recorded away match was at Congleton, a rugby club that were convinced to play a one-off fixture under association rules, in December 1868. From the 1860s, the club played at the Victoria Cricket Club ground; however they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances.\nIn 1878, the club dropped the suffix from its title and became known as Stoke Football Club. It became closely aligned with Stoke Victoria Cricket Club, sharing facilities and some administrative responsibilities. The club played at the Athletic Club ground, which soon became known as the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this time that the club adopted their traditional red-and-white striped kit. In August 1885, the club turned professional.\nStoke were one of the twelve founding members of &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; when it was introduced in 1888. The club struggled in their first two seasons, &lt;a href=\"1888%E2%80%9389%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1888\u201389&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1889%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1889\u201390&lt;/a&gt;, finishing bottom on both occasions. In 1890 Stoke failed to be &lt;a href=\"Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29\"&gt;re-elected&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Alliance\"&gt;Football Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which they won and thus were re-elected to the Football League. Stoke spent the next 15 seasons in the First Division and reached the FA Cup Semi-final in the &lt;a href=\"1898%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1898\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt; before being relegated in 1907 with severe financial problems. Stoke went bankrupt at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1907%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1907\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season and entered non-league football, playing in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;Birmingham &amp; District League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; until 1914, when the First World War meant the Football League was suspended for four years. During the wartime period, Stoke entered the &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29%23Lancashire%20League%20%281939%20to%20date%29\"&gt;Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues&lt;/a&gt;. When football recommenced in August 1919, Stoke re-joined the league.\nVictoria Ground and Stanley Matthews (1919\u20131937).\nThe club became owners of the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. This was followed by the construction of the Butler Street stand, which increased the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted &lt;a href=\"City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;city status&lt;/a&gt; and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City F.C.\nThe 1930s saw the debut of club's most celebrated player, &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Matthews\"&gt;Stanley Matthews&lt;/a&gt;. Matthews, who grew up in &lt;a href=\"Hanley%2C%20Staffordshire\"&gt;Hanley&lt;/a&gt;, was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance in March 1932, against &lt;a href=\"Bury%20F.C.\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 17. By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England international&lt;/a&gt; and as one of the best footballers of his generation. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in &lt;a href=\"1932%E2%80%9333%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1932\u201333&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 as champions \u2013 however Matthews only featured in fifteen games in this season. He did however score his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 win against local rivals &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1934, the club's average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which in turn allowed the club to give the manager &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Mather\"&gt;Tom Mather&lt;/a&gt; increased transfer funds. The club was now considered one of the top teams in the country. It was in this period that the club recorded its record league win, a 10\u20133 win over &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt; in February 1937. In April of that year, the club achieved its record league crowd \u2013 51,373 against &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Freddie%20Steele%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Freddie Steele's&lt;/a&gt; 33 league goals in the &lt;a href=\"1936%E2%80%9337%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1936\u201337 season&lt;/a&gt; remains a club record.\nTitle challenge and league decline (1937\u20131960).\nFollowing the resumption of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, tragedy struck on 9 March 1946, as 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a 6th round tie away against &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. This came known as the &lt;a href=\"Burnden%20Park%20disaster\"&gt;Burnden Park disaster&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1946%E2%80%9347%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1946\u201347&lt;/a&gt;, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge. The club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title. However, a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; meant the title went to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; instead. Stanley Matthews left with 3 games remaining of the 1946\u201347 season, opting to join &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 32.\nStoke were relegated from the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1952%E2%80%9353%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1952\u201353&lt;/a&gt;; during the season &lt;a href=\"Bob%20McGrory\"&gt;Bob McGrory&lt;/a&gt; resigned as the club's manager after 17 years in the role. Former &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201916%29\"&gt;Frank Taylor&lt;/a&gt; took over at the club looking to gain promotion back to the First Division. However, after seven seasons in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; without promotion, Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.\nTony Waddington years (1960\u20131977).\n&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Waddington\"&gt;Tony Waddington&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the club's manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews \u2013 then 46 years old \u2013 back to the club, 14 years after he had departed. The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved eighth position in &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1961\u201362&lt;/a&gt;. Promotion was achieved in the &lt;a href=\"1962%E2%80%9363%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, with Stoke finishing as champions. In their first season back in the top flight, &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1963\u201364&lt;/a&gt;, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Stoke reached the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1964 Football League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, which they lost 4\u20133 to &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt; over two legs.\nWaddington counted on experience; &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Viollet\"&gt;Dennis Viollet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Mudie\"&gt;Jackie Mudie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Vernon\"&gt;Roy Vernon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Setters\"&gt;Maurice Setters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20McIlroy\"&gt;Jimmy McIlroy&lt;/a&gt; were all players signed in the latter stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; for services to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final appearance for the club against &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20F.C.\"&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt; in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Banks\"&gt;Gordon Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1966 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;-winning &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, joined in 1967 for &lt;a href=\"pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;52,000 from Leicester. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. During the close season of 1967, Stoke City played in the one-off &lt;a href=\"United%20Soccer%20Association\"&gt;United Soccer Association&lt;/a&gt; which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Stoke played as the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Stokers\"&gt;Cleveland Stokers&lt;/a&gt; and finished as runner-up of the Eastern Division.\nThe club won its first major trophy on &lt;a href=\"1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;4 March 1972 in the League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. Stoke won 2\u20131 in front of a crowd of 97,852 at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt; with goals from &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Conroy\"&gt;Terry Conroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Eastham\"&gt;George Eastham&lt;/a&gt;. Preceding this victory, Stoke had progressed through 11 games in order to reach the final. This included four games with &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;semi-final&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged tie&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Replay%20%28sports%29\"&gt;replayed&lt;/a&gt; twice. Stoke fared well in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1970\u201371&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1971\u201372&lt;/a&gt; seasons. However, on both occasions Stoke lost to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Replay%20%28sports%29\"&gt;replay&lt;/a&gt;. Stoke also competed in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1972 and 1974 losing at the first attempt to &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern\"&gt;1. FC Kaiserslautern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nIn January 1976, the roof of the Butler Street Stand was blown off in a storm. The repair bill of nearly \u00a3250,000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Hudson\"&gt;Alan Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Pejic\"&gt;Mike Pejic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Greenhoff\"&gt;Jimmy Greenhoff&lt;/a&gt; were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted, Stoke were relegated in the &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1976\u201377 season&lt;/a&gt;. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1\u20130 home defeat to Leicester in March 1977.\nManagerial roundabout (1977\u20131997).\nWaddington was replaced by &lt;a href=\"George%20Eastham\"&gt;George Eastham&lt;/a&gt; in March 1977. However, he could not prevent the club's relegation to the Second Division in &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1976\u201377&lt;/a&gt;. Eastham left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge, and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Durban\"&gt;Alan Durban&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt;. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1978\u201379 season&lt;/a&gt;, but after consolidating the club's position in the First Division, he left to manage &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Barker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201939%29\"&gt;Richie Barker&lt;/a&gt; was appointed for the &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1981\u201382 season&lt;/a&gt;, but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Asprey\"&gt;Bill Asprey&lt;/a&gt;. Asprey decided to bring back veteran &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Hudson\"&gt;Alan Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, and the decision paid off as an improved second half of the season saw Stoke avoid relegation on the final day of the &lt;a href=\"1983%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1983\u201384 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1984\u201385 season&lt;/a&gt; proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points, with just three wins all season. &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Mills\"&gt;Mick Mills&lt;/a&gt; was appointed &lt;a href=\"Player-coach\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1985%E2%80%9386%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1985\u201386 season&lt;/a&gt;, but was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion in his four seasons as manager and was sacked in November 1989. His successor, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Ball%20Jr.\"&gt;Alan Ball Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, became the club's fifth manager in ten years. Ball struggled in his first season in charge, &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1989\u201390&lt;/a&gt;, and Stoke were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. Ball kept his job for the start of the following season, &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1990\u201391&lt;/a&gt;, but departed during February 1991, in an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 14th in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt;, Stoke's lowest league position.\nBall's successor, &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Macari\"&gt;Lou Macari&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed in May 1991, prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1991\u201392 season&lt;/a&gt;. He clinched silverware for the club; the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final\"&gt;1992 Football League Trophy&lt;/a&gt; was won with a 1\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"Stockport%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Stockport County&lt;/a&gt; at Wembley, with &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Stein%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Mark Stein&lt;/a&gt; scoring the only goal of the match. The following season, &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1992\u201393&lt;/a&gt;, promotion was achieved from the third tier. Macari left for his boyhood club &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; in October 1993 to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Joe Jordan&lt;/a&gt;; Stein also departed, in a club record \u00a31.5\u00a0million move to Chelsea. Jordan's tenure in charge was short, leaving the club less than a year after joining, and Stoke opted to re-appoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Stoke finished fourth in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt; but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. Macari left the club at the end of the following season. His last match in charge was the final league game at the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Sheron\"&gt;Mike Sheron&lt;/a&gt;, who was signed two years previously from &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt;, was sold for a club record fee of \u00a32.5\u00a0million in 1997.\nBritannia Stadium and the Icelandic takeover (1997\u20132008).\n&lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1997\u201398&lt;/a&gt; saw Stoke move to its new ground, the &lt;a href=\"bet365%20Stadium\"&gt;Britannia Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. &lt;a href=\"Chic%20Bates\"&gt;Chic Bates&lt;/a&gt;, Macari's assistant, was appointed manager for the club's first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Kamara\"&gt;Chris Kamara&lt;/a&gt; in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes either, and he too left in April. &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Durban\"&gt;Alan Durban&lt;/a&gt;, previously Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts, Durban was unable to keep the club up, as defeat against &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.\n&lt;a href=\"Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Brian Little&lt;/a&gt;, formerly manager of &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, took charge for the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1998\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt;. Despite an impressive start, the team's form tailed off dramatically in the latter stages of the season, which led to Little leaving the club at the end of the season. His successor, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Megson\"&gt;Gary Megson&lt;/a&gt;, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20Holding\"&gt;Stoke Holding&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Icelanders\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;ic consortium, who purchased a 66% share in Stoke City F.C. for \u00a36.6\u00a0million. Stoke became the first Icelandic-owned football club outside of Iceland. They appointed the club's first foreign manager, &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3n%20%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson\"&gt;Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson&lt;/a&gt;, who helped Stoke win the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;Football League Trophy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1999\u20132000 season&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"2000%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final\"&gt;2\u20131 win&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt; in front of a crowd of 85,057 at Wembley.\n\u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson achieved promotion at the third time of asking in &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt; after previous play-off defeats against &lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; were defeated in the semi-final before a &lt;a href=\"2002%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;2\u20130 win&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Stadium\"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt; secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion, \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson was sacked by &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%20G%C3%ADslason%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Gunnar G\u00edslason&lt;/a&gt; just five days later.\n&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Cotterill\"&gt;Steve Cotterill&lt;/a&gt; was drafted in as Thordarson's replacement prior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2002\u201303 season&lt;/a&gt;, but resigned in October 2002 after only four months in charge. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Pulis\"&gt;Tony Pulis&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as Stoke's new manager shortly after. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation, with a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; on the final day of the season keeping the club in the division. However, Pulis was sacked at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2004\u201305 season&lt;/a&gt;, following disagreement between himself and the club's owners.\nDutch manager &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Boskamp\"&gt;Johan Boskamp&lt;/a&gt; was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only one day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp brought in a number of new players from Europe, but his side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. Boskamp left at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; amidst a takeover bid by former chairman &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Coates\"&gt;Peter Coates&lt;/a&gt;. On 23 May 2006, Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City, marking the end of Gunnar G\u00edslason's chairmanship of the club. Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamp's successor in June 2006. Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place, but an eventual eighth-place finish was achieved in the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen years in the Premier League (2008\u20132018).\nStoke won automatic promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; on the final day of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in second place in the &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt;. A 3\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; on the opening day of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt; saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. Stoke managed to turn the Britannia Stadium into a \"fortress\", making it difficult for teams to pick up points there. In their first home match, Stoke defeated Aston Villa 3\u20132, and wins also came against &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;, Arsenal, Sunderland and &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;. After a 2\u20131 win at &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;, Stoke confirmed their place in the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Potters\" finished 12th in their return to the top flight, with a total of 45 points. Stoke finished the following &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2009\u201310 season&lt;/a&gt; in a respectable 11th place, with 47 points. Stoke also made it to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1972, defeating &lt;a href=\"York%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;York City&lt;/a&gt;, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing out to eventual winners Chelsea.\nStoke reached the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, beating Cardiff City, &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; and a famous 5\u20130 win against Bolton, the largest post-war FA Cup semi-final victory. However, they lost the &lt;a href=\"2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final 1\u20130&lt;/a&gt; to Manchester City. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, Stoke advanced past &lt;a href=\"HNK%20Hajduk%20Split\"&gt;Hajduk Split&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Thun\"&gt;Thun&lt;/a&gt; and a tough group containing &lt;a href=\"Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.\"&gt;Be\u015fikta\u015f&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv\"&gt;Dynamo Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; which Stoke managed to progress through finishing in second position. City's reward was a tie against Spanish giants &lt;a href=\"Valencia%20CF\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; and despite putting up a spirited second leg performance, Stoke went out 2\u20130 on aggregate. In the Premier League, Stoke made the high-profile signing of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Crouch\"&gt;Peter Crouch&lt;/a&gt; as they finished in a mid-table position for a fourth time. The &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2012\u201313 season&lt;/a&gt; saw Stoke make little progress, and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.\nPulis was replaced by fellow Welshman &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hughes\"&gt;Mark Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, who signed a three-year contract on 30 May 2013. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt;, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2014\u201315 season&lt;/a&gt; saw Stoke again finish in ninth position this time, with 54 points. Despite breaking their transfer record twice on &lt;a href=\"Xherdan%20Shaqiri\"&gt;Xherdan Shaqiri&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Giannelli%20Imbula\"&gt;Giannelli Imbula&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2015\u201316&lt;/a&gt;, Stoke did not make any progress and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in 13th position. In January 2018, Hughes was sacked after a poor run left the club in the relegation zone. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Lambert\"&gt;Paul Lambert&lt;/a&gt;, who could not prevent the club ending its 10-year spell in the Premier League.\nReturn to the Championship (2018\u2013present).\nFollowing their relegation to the Championship, Lambert was replaced with former Derby County boss &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Rowett\"&gt;Gary Rowett&lt;/a&gt;. Despite spending nearly \u00a350 million on players in the summer transfer window, results and performances were poor and Rowett was subsequently sacked on 8 January 2019 with the team 14th in the table. He was replaced with Luton Town boss &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Jones%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29\"&gt;Nathan Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Stoke went on to end an uneventful &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt; season in 16th place with a record number of draws (22). After achieving just 2 wins in the opening 14 games of the following season, Jones was sacked on 1 November 2019 with the team in the relegation zone. Northern Ireland boss &lt;a href=\"Michael%20O%27Neill%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Michael O'Neill&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed as his replacement a week later. Results improved under O'Neill and the team managed to avoid relegation, finishing in 15th.\nStadium.\nIt is not clear where Stoke's original playing fields were located. Their first pitch was certainly in the site of a present burial ground in Lonsdale Street, although there is evidence that they also played on land near to the Copeland Arms public house on Campbell Road. In 1875, they moved to Sweetings Field, which was owned by the mayor of Stoke, Alderman Sweeting. It is estimated that as many as 200\u2013250 spectators were attending home matches at Sweetings Field, paying one penny for admission. Stoke were to stay at Sweetings Field until a merger with the Stoke Victoria Cricket Club in March 1878, when Stoke moved to the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first match to be played at the Victoria Ground was a friendly against Talke Rangers on 28 March 1878; Stoke won 1\u20130 in front of 2,500 fans. The ground was originally an oval shape to cater for athletics, and this shape was retained for the next 30 years. Major development work began in the 1920s, and by 1930 the ground had lost its original shape. By 1935, the ground capacity was up to 50,000. A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a league match against Arsenal.\nFloodlights were installed in 1956 and another new main stand was built. Over the weekend of the 3/4 in January 1976, gale-force winds blew the roof off the Butler Street Stand. Stoke played a home League match against &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vale%20Park\"&gt;Vale Park&lt;/a&gt; whilst repair work was on-going. The Stoke End Stand was improved in 1979 and through the 1980s more improvements were made. By 1995, Stoke drew up plans to make the ground an all seater stadium, to comply with the &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Report\"&gt;Taylor Report&lt;/a&gt;. However, the club decided it would be better to leave the Victoria Ground and re-locate to a new site.\nIn 1997, Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years, and moved to the modern 28,384 all seater &lt;a href=\"Bet365%20Stadium\"&gt;Britannia Stadium&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of \u00a314.7\u00a0million. Stoke struggled at first to adjust to their new surroundings and were relegated to the third tier in the first season at the new ground. In 2002, a record 28,218 attended an FA Cup match against &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;. With Stoke gaining promotion to the Premier League in 2008, attendances increased. However, the capacity was reduced to 27,500 due to segregation. The name of the ground was changed to the Bet365 Stadium in June 2016. Work began on expanding the stadium to over 30,000 in February 2017 and was concluded in the summer of 2017.\nSupporters.\nWhile much of the support that the club enjoys is from the local &lt;a href=\"Stoke-on-Trent\"&gt;Stoke-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt; area, there are a number of exile fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries further afield such as Russia, the United States and Australia. A capacity crowd regularly turned out to see them in the Premier League.\nStoke have had problems in the past with &lt;a href=\"football%20hooliganism\"&gt;football hooliganism&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, '80s, '90s and early 2000s which gave the club a bad reputation, this was to the actions by the &lt;a href=\"Naughty%20Forty\"&gt;\"Naughty Forty\" firm&lt;/a&gt; which associated itself with the club and was formed by supporter Mark Chester. Mark Chester reformed himself and now works as a youth inclusion promoter. In 2003, the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; described Stoke City as having \"one of the most active and organised football hooligan firms in England\". In response to these criticisms, the club introduced an Away Travel ID scheme. This was subsequently suspended in 2008 as a result of improved behaviour and an enhanced reputation. More recently, Stoke City's fans and their stadium have been perceived as loud, friendly, passionate and modern, welcoming as guests &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Ray%20Leonard\"&gt;Sugar Ray Leonard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;. There is in the media now \"genuine admiration for the volume and volatility of the club's loyal support\". Stoke announced that they would offer supporters free bus travel to every Premier League away game in the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 seasons.\nIn November 2008, a group of Stoke fans were forced by the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Manchester%20Police\"&gt;Greater Manchester Police&lt;/a&gt; to leave &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; before a league match against &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;. The Human Rights group &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20%28pressure%20group%29\"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; took up the case of the fans, and Greater Manchester police eventually apologised for their actions and the fans were awarded compensation. Supporters of the club have adopted \"&lt;a href=\"Delilah%20%28Tom%20Jones%20song%29\"&gt;Delilah&lt;/a&gt;\" as their club anthem since the 1970s. It was adopted by the fans after a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the song's original lyrics have been adapted for the terraces, but the essence of the song remains the same. Stoke's official club anthem is \"We'll be with you\" which was recorded by the Stoke players prior to the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1972 Football League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 2008 and 2011, local fan \"Pottermouth\" contributed a series of raps to &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%20Stoke\"&gt;BBC Radio Stoke&lt;/a&gt; about Stoke's &lt;a href=\"2007-08%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;promotion&lt;/a&gt;, their battle to &lt;a href=\"2008-09%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;stay in the Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2011 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;.\nRivalries.\nStoke's local rivals are &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;, based in the &lt;a href=\"Burslem\"&gt;Burslem&lt;/a&gt; area of Stoke-on-Trent. As the two clubs have regularly been in different divisions, there have only been 46 league matches between the two sides, with the last match being in 2002. Regardless of the lack of matches, the &lt;a href=\"Potteries%20derby\"&gt;Potteries derby&lt;/a&gt; is often a tight and close game of football with few goals being scored. Stoke have won 19 matches while Vale have won 15.\nDue to the rarity of this fixture, Stoke have more established rivalries with Midlands clubs &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. A rivalry with Welsh side &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; was formed in the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2001\u201302 season&lt;/a&gt; where the sides played each other in the Second Division play-offs.\nKit and crest.\nKit.\nStoke's traditional kit is red and white striped shirts with white shorts and socks. Their first strip was &lt;a href=\"Navy%20blue\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28color%29\"&gt;cardinal&lt;/a&gt; hoops with white &lt;a href=\"Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;knickerbockers&lt;/a&gt; and hooped stockings. This changed to black and blue hoops before the club settled on red and white stripes in 1883. However, in 1891 &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20League\"&gt;the Football League&lt;/a&gt; decided that only one club could use one style of strip \"per\" season and &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; were allowed to take red and white stripes. So between 1891 and 1908 Stoke used a variety of kits with plain &lt;a href=\"Maroon%20%28color%29\"&gt;maroon&lt;/a&gt; being the most common. In 1908, Stoke lost their League status and were able to finally revert to red and white and when they re-joined the league in 1919 the rule was scrapped. Since then, Stoke have forever used red and white striped shirts, with the only time when they diverted from this was for two seasons in the mid-1980s, which saw them wear a pin-striped shirt.\nCrest.\nStoke's first club crest was a stylised \"S\" which was used by players in 1882 who would stitch the crest on to their shirts; however, this practice soon faded away. In the 1950s Stoke began using the shield from the Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which was used infrequently until 1977. A new and simpler club crest was introduced a &lt;a href=\"Stafford%20knot\"&gt;Stafford knot&lt;/a&gt; and pottery kiln represented local tradition while red and white stripes were also added. This lasted until 1992 when the club decided to use the entire Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which included the club's name at the top of the crest. They changed their crest in 2001 to the current version which includes their nickname \"The Potters\". For the 2012\u201313 season, they used a special version to mark the club's 150th anniversary which included the club's Latin motto \"Vis Unita Fortior\" (\"United Strength is Stronger\").\nPlayers.\nFormer players.\n\"For details of former players, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20players\"&gt;List of Stoke City F.C. players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20players%20%2825%E2%80%9399%20appearances%29\"&gt;List of Stoke City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20players%20%281%E2%80%9324%20appearances%29\"&gt;List of Stoke City F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)&lt;/a&gt; and .\"\nPlayer records.\n\"For player records, including player awards, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics\"&gt;List of Stoke City F.C. records and statistics&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nClub management.\nSource:\nHead of Football Operations: Andy Cousins\nHonours.\nStoke City's honours include the following:\nLeague.\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; (2nd tier)\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; (3rd tier)\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20Alliance\"&gt;Football Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;Birmingham &amp; District League&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; Division Two\nCups.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;: 1\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;Football League Trophy&lt;/a&gt;: 2\n&lt;a href=\"Watney%20Cup\"&gt;Watney Cup&lt;/a&gt;: 1\nRegional/reserve.\n&lt;a href=\"Staffordshire%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Staffordshire Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt;: 19\n&lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Birmingham Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt;: 2\nIsle of Man Trophy: 3\nRecords.\nRecord appearances:\nRecord goalscorers:\nRecord signing:\nRecord sale:\nRecord results:\nAttendance records:"
