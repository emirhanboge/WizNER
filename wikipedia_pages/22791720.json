The family returned to Lithuania in 1964.\nOn June 26, 2019 he announced about suspending his membership in &lt;a href=\"Homeland%20Union%20%E2%80%93%20Lithuanian%20Christian%20Democrats\"&gt;Homeland Union \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, on the same day his membership was suspended by Discipline Committee of Homeland Union. Displine Committee has explained that this decision was made, since Rimantas Dagys has not removed his signature supporting the amendments of Child protection law (thus acting together with &lt;a href=\"Mindaugas%20Puidokas\"&gt;Mindaugas Puidokas&lt;/a&gt;), has raised doubts about the correspondence of values of party's candidate in &lt;a href=\"2019%20Lithuanian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2019 Lithuanian presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingrida%20%C5%A0imonyt%C4%97\"&gt;Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Christian%20democracy\"&gt;Christian democracy&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that the amendments of Social enterprise law were proposed by party members &lt;a href=\"Justas%20D%C5%BEiugelis\"&gt;Justas D\u017eiugelis&lt;/a&gt; ir &lt;a href=\"Monika%20Navickien%C4%97\"&gt;Monika Navickien\u0117&lt;/a&gt;. R. Dagys claimed that the conflict has started because Homeland Union, as many other parties, rejected a clear &lt;a href=\"ideology\"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt;, which, in his opinion is the fault of chairman &lt;a href=\"Gabrielius%20Landsbergis\"&gt;Gabrielius Landsbergis&lt;/a&gt;, who, in his opinion, holds &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; views.\nAfterwards Rimantas Dagys established a party called &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Union%20%28Lithuania%29\"&gt;Christian Union&lt;/a&gt;. Its constituent congress happened on February 8, 2020."
