    "text": "A national drink is a distinct beverage that is strongly associated with a particular country, and can be part of their &lt;a href=\"national%20identity\"&gt;national identity&lt;/a&gt; and self-image. National drinks fall into two categories: alcoholic and nonalcoholic. An alcoholic national drink is sometimes a liquor drunk straight/neat (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Irish%20whiskey\"&gt;whiskey&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland), but is most often a mixed drink (e.g., caipirinhas in Brazil) or beer or wine. A beverage can be considered a national drink for a variety of reasons:\nIn some cases, it may be impossible to settle on a national drink for a particular country. In the realm of food at least, Zilkia Janer, a lecturer on &lt;a href=\"Latin%20American%20culture\"&gt;Latin American culture&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hofstra%20University\"&gt;Hofstra University&lt;/a&gt;, says that it is impossible to choose a single national dish, even unofficially, for countries such as &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; because of their diverse ethnic populations and cultures.Though Tadi has been termed as national drink of India. At the other end of the spectrum, sometimes different countries see the same beverage as their national drink (e.g., &lt;a href=\"pisco%20sour\"&gt;pisco sour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe national drinks below are categorized within geo-political regions modified from the United Nations' five \"regional groups\". This list usually does not include &lt;a href=\"moonshine\"&gt;moonshine&lt;/a&gt;s or alcoholic beverages produced illicitly.\nEurope.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20belts%20of%20Europe\"&gt;beer belt&lt;/a&gt;\" in Western Europe includes Germany, the UK, and Ireland, whereas the \"&lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20belts%20of%20Europe\"&gt;wine belt&lt;/a&gt;\" includes the Mediterranean countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. Several drinks are common and particular to Slavic countries. &lt;a href=\"Vodka\"&gt;Vodka&lt;/a&gt; is a clear alcoholic beverage made most often by distilling the liquid from fermented &lt;a href=\"cereal%20grains\"&gt;cereal grains&lt;/a&gt; and potatoes. Countries where vodka is identified as a national beverage have been referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Vodka%20Belt\"&gt;vodka belt&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Kvass\"&gt;Kvass&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional fermented non-alcoholic beverage commonly made from rye bread and is drank in many Slavic countries, as well as the three &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Countries\"&gt;Baltic countries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kompot\"&gt;Kompot&lt;/a&gt; is another drink that is traditionally popular throughout this region and made by boiling together different fruit including &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;strawberries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apricot\"&gt;apricot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"peach\"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"raisin\"&gt;raisin&lt;/a&gt;s in large volume of water and served hot or cold, depending on tradition and season. &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20brandy\"&gt;Fruit brandies&lt;/a&gt; are popular in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%A4nnvin\"&gt;Br\u00e4nnvin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akvavit\"&gt;Akvavit&lt;/a&gt; are popular in Scandinavia."
