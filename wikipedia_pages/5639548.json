During the match, Anderlecht were awarded a dubious &lt;a href=\"penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt;, and a last minute Nottingham Forest goal\u2014that would have won them the tie on the &lt;a href=\"away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was disallowed. In 2016, it emerged that UEFA had known about the bribe since 1993 but had taken no action until the information was made public in 1997, when UEFA suspended Anderlecht from the next European tournament for which they qualified. On qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1998\u201399 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Anderlecht appealed the suspension in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt;, which overturned the ban on the grounds that it was made by UEFA's executive committee, which did not have the authority to issue the ban.\nFirst leg.\n\"The match featured an infamous incident that saw a Hajduk fan (later identified as Ante Baraba, a resident of Paljuv settlement within the &lt;a href=\"Novigrad%2C%20Zadar%20County\"&gt;Novigrad&lt;/a&gt; village) run onto the pitch prior to kickoff with a live &lt;a href=\"rooster\"&gt;rooster&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in reference to Tottenham's club symbol, the cockerel \u2013 and, while standing at the centre circle, proceeding to kill the animal by snapping its neck. The contest took place as scheduled, however, as a result of the incident, Hajduk was fined &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20franc\"&gt;CHF&lt;/a&gt;3,000 and ordered to play at least 300\u00a0km away from their home stadium for their next European tie that turned out to be the &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1984\u201385 European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%23First%20round\"&gt;first round&lt;/a&gt; game against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow\"&gt;Dynamo Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSecond leg.\n\"Anderlecht won 3\u20132 on aggregate.\"\n\"2\u20132 on aggregate; Tottenham Hotspur won on away goals.\"\nFinal.\nSecond leg.\n\"2\u20132 on aggregate; Tottenham Hotspur won 4\u20133 on penalties.\""
