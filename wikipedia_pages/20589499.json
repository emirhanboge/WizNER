    "title": "Cautelary jurisprudence",
    "text": "Cautelary jurisprudence is &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; made in a precautionary way prior to or outside of the normal &lt;a href=\"Legislature\"&gt;legislative enactment&lt;/a&gt;. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular &lt;a href=\"jurisprudence\"&gt;jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt; which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall. Its first proponent was &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Mucius%20Scaevola%20Pontifex\"&gt;Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex&lt;/a&gt;, who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the \"&lt;a href=\"cautio%20muciana\"&gt;cautio muciana&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCautelary law is a tentative \"procedure\" used by &lt;a href=\"lawyers\"&gt;lawyers&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, the idea of &lt;a href=\"inheritance\"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt; as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With \"cautio muciana\" it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the \"&lt;a href=\"legatee\"&gt;legatee&lt;/a&gt;s\", a \"negative authority\" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the \"&lt;a href=\"legator\"&gt;legator&lt;/a&gt;\". It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees.\nThe legatee provides a &lt;a href=\"stipulatio\"&gt;stipulatio&lt;/a&gt; or \"cautio\", promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, \"I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married.\"\nThe \"cautio muciana\" is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles.\nCautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with &lt;a href=\"inheritance%20law\"&gt;inheritance law&lt;/a&gt; and the administration of &lt;a href=\"trusts\"&gt;trusts&lt;/a&gt;. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or &lt;a href=\"judge\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt;s. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature."
