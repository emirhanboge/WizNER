    "text": "The Hankyoreh (, literally \"The Korean Nation\" or \"One Nation\") is a &lt;a href=\"Centre-left%20politics\"&gt;centre-left&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; daily newspaper in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It was established in 1988 after widespread purges forced out dissident journalists, and was envisioned as an alternative to existing newspapers, who were regarded as unduly influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Chun%20Doo-hwan\"&gt;authoritarian government&lt;/a&gt; at the time. When it opened, it claimed to be \"the first newspaper in the world truly independent of political power and large capital.\" As of 2016, it has been voted as the most trusted news organization by Korean journalists for nine consecutive years but also it is the least influential news outlet by the survey. It has a web edition in English.\nHistory.\nThe newspaper was originally established as \"Hankyoreh Shinmun\" () on 15 May 1988 by ex-journalists from the &lt;a href=\"Dong-a%20Ilbo\"&gt;Dong-a Ilbo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chosun%20Ilbo\"&gt;Chosun Ilbo&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, government censors were in every newsroom, newspaper content was virtually dictated by the Ministry of Culture &amp; Information, and newspapers had nearly the same articles on every page. Hankyoreh was intended to provide an independent, left-leaning and &lt;a href=\"Civic%20nationalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Korean%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; alternative to mainstream newspapers regarded as blindly pro-business and opposed to &lt;a href=\"Korean%20reunification\"&gt;national reunification&lt;/a&gt;. To underscore its patriotism and its break with tradition, the Hankyoreh became the first daily to completely reject the use of &lt;a href=\"hanja\"&gt;hanja&lt;/a&gt; and use only hangul; it continues to make only limited use of the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin alphabet&lt;/a&gt; and limits the use of &lt;a href=\"loanword\"&gt;loanword&lt;/a&gt;s. It was also the first newspaper in Korea to be printed &lt;a href=\"Horizontal%20and%20vertical%20writing%20in%20East%20Asian%20scripts\"&gt;horizontally instead of vertically&lt;/a&gt;.\nStances on political issues.\nBetween liberal nationalism and internationalism.\nThe Hankyoreh is the most critical major media to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; among South Korean media. In a October 7, 2016 article, there was an article that said that the &lt;a href=\"Anti-imperialism\"&gt;anti-imperialist&lt;/a&gt; investigation in South Korea, \"Opposite of Japan\" (), and the far-right racist \"Hate of Korea\" () in Japan were very completely different, and that it was wrong to identify the two. In particular, the newspaper argues that Korea's \"Opposite of Japan\" does not lead to racism and hate crimes against the Japanese, and is a legitimate emotion of the affected country. However, the newspaper has criticized racism against Japanese living in Korea rather than conservative media. (Hankyoreh takes a liberal-nationalist position that discrimination against the Japanese as a minority living in South Korea is not politically correct, but opposition to the state of Japan is politically correct.) The Hankyoreh known as the most &lt;a href=\"Pro-Europeanism\"&gt;pro-European&lt;/a&gt; media in South Korea. When Britain decided on &lt;a href=\"Brexit\"&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt;, Hankyoreh criticized Britain's choice in an editorial on June 24, 2016.\nOn the conflictual nature of the territorial sovereignty of the &lt;a href=\"Liancourt%20Rocks\"&gt;Liancourt Rocks&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dokdo\" in Korean, \"Takeshima\" in Japanese), although exceeded by the Chosun Ilbo in its coverage, the Hankyoreh's coverage has been described in \u201cA Comparative Analysis of News Coverage of Dokdo Island\u201d by Yoon Youngchul and E Gwangho as reflecting the foreign policy interest of South Korea versus the Japan.\nIn line with the newspaper's nationalism and aspirations for reunification, its reporting of inter-Korean and East Asian affairs is based on its editorial policy seeking reconciliation, stability and peaceful co-prosperity through dialogue rather than pressure on &lt;a href=\"government%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;government of North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of national affairs, &lt;a href=\"Cheongwadae\"&gt;Cheongwadae&lt;/a&gt;, Office of the President, studies on the editorial policies of South Korean newspapers have found that the \"Hankyoreh Shinmun, which published its first issue early in the Roh Tae Woo administration, has shown little fluctuation from administration to administration. Hankyoreh also runs a \"Hankyoreh Foundation for Reunification and Culture\" as a forum for advocacy of peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula. Notwithstanding the newspaper's support for democracy, human rights, and free speech in South Korea, in June 2009, the Hankyoreh described the &lt;a href=\"2009%20imprisonment%20of%20US%20journalists%20by%20North%20Korea\"&gt;arrest and imprisonment of two US journalists in North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, condemned by &lt;a href=\"Reporters%20Without%20Borders\"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; as a sham trial, as a \"not entirely negative signal\" of North Korea's openness to communicate.\nSocial liberalism and supporting human rights.\nOther legacies of its early dissident history include a strong emphasis on human rights in South Korea, a position it continues to hold today together with several international organizations have criticized South Korea for its retreat in democracy, human rights and press freedom. The Hankyoreh's advocacy of human rights also extends to &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20in%20North%20Korea\"&gt;North Koreans&lt;/a&gt; and tends to support normalization of relations with the U.S. and have been critical of approaches towards improving the situation by encouraging system collapse such as the Lefkowitz approach and absorption by South Korea or by encouraging defections.\nThe Hankyoreh opposes censorship and wiretapping and encourages active debate on news that is circulated, and like many newspapers in South Korea, is opposed to circulation of graphic news content and took a strong stance in the instance of the video footage of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Sun-il\"&gt;Kim Sun-il&lt;/a&gt;'s death in Iraq. It strongly endorsed the &lt;a href=\"US%20beef%20imports%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;2008 \"mad cow protests\"&lt;/a&gt; as a victory for \"substantive democracy\" over merely \"procedural democracy.\" It strongly encouraged coverage of the 2008 demonstrations and a greater understanding of \"candlelight spirit\" that academics are referring to as an emergence of a new social movement and form of democracy in South Korea that protests policy development on trade, liberalization of public education, the privatization of health, and the environmental consequences of a cross-country canal project without substantial public opinion gathering.\nThe Hankyoreh has campaigned for higher standards of ethics in journalism since its founding and had initiated a campaign against journalists' taking bribes, which had been customary in the industry in South Korea until the late 1990s.\nThe Hankyoreh has a fairly favorable view of &lt;a href=\"Feminism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt;, opposes discrimination against ethnic minorities and supports &lt;a href=\"political%20correctness\"&gt;political correctness&lt;/a&gt;. However, some editorials criticized political correctness. Hankyoreh's shows a favorable tone for &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but opposes their somewhat socially conservative approach to LGBT rights.\nEconomic and Labour propensity.\nThe Hankyoreh has been critical of &lt;a href=\"Chaebol\"&gt;Korean big business&lt;/a&gt; and conglomerates that overwhelm the market, the Korean university entrance system, widening income disparities in Korean society, while maintaining a generally favorable attitude towards organized labor, and the redistribution of income.\nHankyoreh departed from established convention by relying more on sales, periodic private donation campaigns, and the sale of stock, rather than advertising from major corporations to sustain itself. The newspaper currently has more than 60,000 citizen shareholders, none of whom have a more than one percent share. Core shareholders include students, professors, lawyers, writers, liberals and urban industrial workers. The company remains intentionally unlisted to avoid hostile takeover; it has also never shown three consecutive years of profit, one of the requirements for listing. Readership of the newspaper is evenly distributed between provinces and the major metropolitan areas, of which 63.2% were in their twenties and thirties, and 44.5% were college graduates. Hankyoreh's readership is mostly of low to middle class income.\nCriticism of mainstream right-wing conservative.\nAfter three decades in print, Hankyoreh's subscriber base is still comparatively small. Its circulation of about 600,000 readers, puts it at one third the size of any of the three major dailies (the \"&lt;a href=\"Chosun%20Ilbo\"&gt;Chosun Ilbo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"JoongAng%20Ilbo\"&gt;JoongAng Ilbo&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Dong-a%20Ilbo\"&gt;Dong-a Ilbo&lt;/a&gt;\"), though still ahead of specialist economic dailies. It is the fourth largest newspaper in Korea. Hankyoreh's editorial content consists of strident criticism of the three major newspapers. It has also endorsed boycott campaigns of companies that advertise in its competitors.\nIn 2009, Hankyoreh joined &lt;a href=\"Amnesty%20International\"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, the Broadcaster Producers Association of Korea, and other civic groups airing concern atypical behavior by prosecutors in the detention Korean TV channel &lt;a href=\"Munhwa%20Broadcasting%20Corporation%23PD%20Notebook%20and%20allegations%20of%20unethical%20journalism\"&gt;MBC&lt;/a&gt; journalists and the attack on press freedom in South Korea. Although there has been controversy over for distortions in MBC's reporting on &lt;a href=\"US%20beef%20imports%20in%20South%20Korea%23MBC%20%E2%80%9CPD%20Notebook%E2%80%9D%20broadcast\"&gt;US beef imports&lt;/a&gt;, acts of arresting journalists and continued persecution of the press has been a primary concern for the Hankyoreh and other international journalist organizations.\nBesides that.\nIn 2014, it partnered with a comic artists union, Toonion, to create a global creative content company called RollingStory, which launched an online sharing platform, &lt;a href=\"Spottoon\"&gt;Spottoon&lt;/a&gt;, for South Korean digital comics in 2015."
