    "text": "The British American Football League (BAFL) was the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s primary &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; league from 1998 until 2010. It was formerly known as the British Senior League (BSL) until 2005. BAFL was the trading name for Gridiron Football League Ltd incorporated as a Company limited by guarantee. Registration number: 2353839. The company went into &lt;a href=\"administration%20%28British%20football%29\"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 2010, and the company ceased to trade as from this date.\nThe League had 3 &lt;a href=\"division%20%28sport%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;s: Premier, 1 and 2, each with a playoff series and championship game to determine a winner. The Championship participants were promoted to the divisions above and the lowest-ranking teams in each division are relegated. Only clubs from &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; played; clubs in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; competed against &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; clubs in an all-Ireland &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American%20Football%20League\"&gt;Irish American Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeams competed annually to reach the championship game (&lt;a href=\"BritBowl\"&gt;BritBowl&lt;/a&gt;) and win the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Trophy\"&gt;Boston Trophy&lt;/a&gt;. The game was traditionally hosted at &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Don%20Valley%20Stadium\"&gt;Don Valley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, however the venue for the finals was switched in &lt;a href=\"2008%20BAFL%20season\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; because of a schedule conflict with &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United FC&lt;/a&gt;, the stadium's temporary tenants, with the match instead being played at the &lt;a href=\"Keepmoat%20Stadium\"&gt;Keepmoat Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doncaster\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nTensions grew between the directors of BAFL and those of the &lt;a href=\"British%20American%20Football%20Association\"&gt;British American Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, the governing body throughout 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, BAFL formally, but unconstitutionally, withdrew from BAFA. This led to uproar from the teams within BAFL, ultimately signalling the end for BAFL as an entity. The league ceased operations on 1 April 2010. The league was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"BAFA%20Community%20Leagues\"&gt;BAFA Community Leagues&lt;/a&gt; for the 2010 season. This organisation, run under the umbrella of the governing body, rebranded in 2011 to become the &lt;a href=\"BAFA%20National%20Leagues\"&gt;BAFA National Leagues&lt;/a&gt;."
