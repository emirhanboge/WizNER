    "text": "Sadowsky Guitars Limited is an American high-end &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass guitar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"preamplifier\"&gt;preamp&lt;/a&gt;s manufacturer based in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island%20City\"&gt;Long Island City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe company was started in 1979 and took its name from its founder, Roger Sadowsky, known for \"being one of the industry's master craftsmen\". As of 2011 the company has 10 employees involved in instrument manufacturing excluding Sadowsky himself.\nSadowsky started out modifying &lt;a href=\"vintage\"&gt;vintage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation\"&gt;Fender&lt;/a&gt; basses, which were at that time inexpensive, to improve their sound by adding more noise reduction technology and replacing the passive electronics with an active &lt;a href=\"preamp\"&gt;preamp&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the bass's &lt;a href=\"signal-to-noise%20ratio\"&gt;signal-to-noise ratio&lt;/a&gt;. Once the price of vintage bass guitars began to increase, Sadowsky started making new bass guitars, and then signature models.\nModels.\nNYC Range.\nThe Sadowsky \"NYC\" line of instruments consists of four- and five-string bass guitars and six-string guitars. The bass guitars have a 34-inch scale length with no current models offered in longer or shorter &lt;a href=\"Bass%20guitar%23Design%20considerations\"&gt;scale lengths&lt;/a&gt;. All Sadowsky basses are available only with bolt-on necks. A weight-reducing chambered body is unique to the NYC range (including Satin series and Deluxe Satin series). The NYC series has a wide range of customisation options. The electronics of the NYC series are all hand wired.\nNYC Satin.\nThe Satin range of NYC basses are made in the same workshop as the NYC basses, with a reduction in colour options with a satin finish. There are no customisation options available. Sadowsky introduced the &lt;a href=\"Verdine%20White\"&gt;Verdine White&lt;/a&gt; signature bass in the Satin line of instruments. This bass was built as a tribute to Verdine's late brother, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20White\"&gt;Maurice White&lt;/a&gt;. Two instruments are being donated to the Verdine White Performing Arts Center with proceeds from sales of this model being donated in addition to the instruments. The electronics of the Satin range are pre-wired, and the tuners are Korean made.\nThe Deluxe Satin range of NYC basses follow the same cost-saving principals as the regular Satin range, but with the addition of flame maple tops at extra cost. The electronics of the Satin range are pre-wired, and the tuners are Korean made.\nMetroLine.\nThe Sadowsky Metro line are the basic models of Sadowsky NYC basses made by Sadowsky Tokyo and offers most of the same features, minus the custom options, of the NYC line at a more affordable price. These instruments are made by hand by Yoshi Kikuchi and his team.\nThe Sadowsky Metro Express line of basses are factory-made instruments made in Japan. These models have a very limited colour choice.\nSadowsky, as of 2003, also offers a line of archtop guitars. There are currently five models available, the &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Hall%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Jim Hall&lt;/a&gt; model, the &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Bruno\"&gt;Jimmy Bruno&lt;/a&gt; model, the semi-hollow model, the LS-17 (long scale/17\" lower bout) and the SS-15 (short scale/15\" lower bout).\nSerial Numbering.\nNYC Instruments.\nInstruments manufactured in New York City are assigned as follows:\nJapan (Metro) Instruments.\nInstruments manufactured in Japan at assigned as follows:\nPlayers and endorsers.\nThe various archtop guitar models are played and endorsed by many professional guitarists.\nSadowsky bass models are used by high-profile musicians"
