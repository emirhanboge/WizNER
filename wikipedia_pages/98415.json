    "text": "Renpet was, in the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20language\"&gt;Egyptian language&lt;/a&gt;, the word for \"year\". Its hieroglyph was figuratively depicted in &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; as a woman wearing a &lt;a href=\"Palm%20tree\"&gt;palm&lt;/a&gt; shoot (symbolizing &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;) over her head. She was often referred to as the \"Mistress of &lt;a href=\"Eternity\"&gt;Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" and also personified fertility, youth and &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28season%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;. The glyph regularly appears on monuments and documents throughout Egyptian history as the beginning of the phrase recording the regnal year of the pharaoh."
