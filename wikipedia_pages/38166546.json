    "text": "Parallel worlds chess is a &lt;a href=\"Three-dimensional%20chess\"&gt;three-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chess%20variant\"&gt;chess variant&lt;/a&gt; invented by R. Wayne Schmittberger in the 1980s. The gamespace comprises three 8\u00d78 &lt;a href=\"chessboard\"&gt;chessboard&lt;/a&gt;s at different levels. Each side commands two full &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; armies on levels 1 and 3. Level 2 begins empty and obeys its own move rules.\nGame description.\nEach player controls two complete &lt;a href=\"Chess%20pieces\"&gt;chess armies&lt;/a&gt;, initially on levels 1 and 3. &lt;a href=\"White%20and%20Black%20in%20chess\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; moves first. The first player to \"capture\" either enemy &lt;a href=\"King%20%28chess%29\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; wins the game.\nMove rules.\nOn each turn, a player may move \"up to three\" of their &lt;a href=\"chess%20pieces\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt;. (On the \"first\" turn, however, White may move no more than \"two\" pieces.) Each piece moved can move only once in the turn. The only stipulation is that none of these moves may \"end\" on the same level. (They may begin on the same level, however.) \nAll men except &lt;a href=\"King%20%28chess%29\"&gt;kings&lt;/a&gt; can move straight up or down one level to an empty square. (Thus captures are not permitted when moving to a new level.)\nOn levels 1 and 3, moves, captures, and &lt;a href=\"Pawn%20%28chess%29\"&gt;pawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Promotion%20%28chess%29\"&gt;promotions&lt;/a&gt; follow the same rules as in &lt;a href=\"Chess%20rules\"&gt;standard chess&lt;/a&gt;. On level 2, special rules apply:\nRules for pawns that move from level 2:\nReferences.\nBibliography"
