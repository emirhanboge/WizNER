    "text": "Insight on the News (also called \"Insight\") was an American &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; print and online &lt;a href=\"news%20magazine\"&gt;news magazine&lt;/a&gt;. It was owned by &lt;a href=\"News%20World%20Communications\"&gt;News World Communications&lt;/a&gt;, an international media conglomerate founded by &lt;a href=\"Unification%20movement\"&gt;Unification movement&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Myung%20Moon\"&gt;Sun Myung Moon&lt;/a&gt;, which at the time owned \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Times\"&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"United%20Press%20International\"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt;, and several newspapers in Japan, South Korea, Africa, and South America. \"Insight\"s reporting sometimes resulted in journalistic controversy.\nBackground and history.\n\"Insight\" was founded in 1985. In 1991 the magazine was one of the first publications to use the word \"&lt;a href=\"Islamophobia\"&gt;Islamophobia&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1997 \"Insight\" reported that the administration of President Bill Clinton gave political donors rights to be buried in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. This charge was widely repeated on talk radio and other conservative outlets; but was later denied by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;, which has charge over the cemetery. Media and political pressure led to the body of &lt;a href=\"M.%20Larry%20Lawrence\"&gt;M. Larry Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Ambassador\"&gt;United States Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, to be exhumed at Arlington and &lt;a href=\"reinter\"&gt;reinter&lt;/a&gt;red at another location.\nContributors included &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Beichman\"&gt;Arnold Beichman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arnaud%20de%20Borchgrave\"&gt;Arnaud de Borchgrave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gaffney\"&gt;Frank Gaffney, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lew%20Rockwell\"&gt;Lew Rockwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1998 &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reported that \"Insight\" \"created a stir\" when &lt;a href=\"Paula%20Jones\"&gt;Paula Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who had filed a &lt;a href=\"sexual%20harassment\"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit against President Clinton, was the magazine's guest at the annual &lt;a href=\"White%20House%20Correspondents%20Association\"&gt;White House Correspondents Association&lt;/a&gt; dinner where Clinton spoke.\nIn 1999 \"Insight\" criticized &lt;a href=\"Project%20Megiddo\"&gt;Project Megiddo&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; report on possible &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20terrorism\"&gt;right-wing terrorism&lt;/a&gt; predicted for the year 2000.\nIn 2001 \"Insight\" printed an article by Dan Smith which said that &lt;a href=\"immigration\"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; and an ethnically diverse population helped to protect the United States against &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. This article was reprinted as a chapter in the 2004 book .\nIn 2002 \"Insight\" printed a story by \"Washington Times\" reporter Steve Miller writing that &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African Americans&lt;/a&gt; were doing well economically. This story was reprinted in the 2005 book \"Race Relations: Opposing Viewpoints\".\nIn 2003, \"Insight\" misquoted President &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; as saying during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;: \"Congressmen who willfully take action during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs, and should be arrested, exiled or hanged.\" By 2008, this statement was being widely repeated, although Lincoln never said or wrote it.\nIn 2004 \"Insight\" printed an article by Abdulwahah Alkebsi defending the role of &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; in bringing &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. The story was reprinted as a chapter in the 2004 book: \"Islam: Opposing Viewpoints\".\nIn 2004, News World Communications discontinued publication of the print magazine and hired &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20T.%20Kuhner\"&gt;Jeffrey T. Kuhner&lt;/a&gt; to run \"Insight\" as a stand-alone &lt;a href=\"website\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Under Kuhner, \"Insight\" did not identify its reporters, in what Kuhner described as an effort to encourage contributions from sources who \"do not want to reveal their names\". Kuhner said about this:\nIn 2007, \"Insight\" reported on an undercover investigation of the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center, located in &lt;a href=\"Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Falls Church, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, by the group Society of Americans for National Existence (SANE). \"Insight's\" story was denounced by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20on%20American-Islamic%20Relations\"&gt;Council on American-Islamic Relations&lt;/a&gt; (CAIR).\nIn May 2008 \"Insight\" ended publication and wrote to its readers: \"The kind of cutting edge behind-the-scenes political intelligence you have come to rely upon from Insight will now be available from its sister publication, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Times\"&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/a&gt;\".\"\nClinton/Obama controversy in 2008 Presidential Campaign.\nOn January 17, 2007, \"Insight\" published a story which claimed that someone on the campaign staff of American presidential candidate Senator &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton\"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; had leaked a report to one of \"Insight's\" reporters which said that Senator &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; had \"spent at least four years in a so-called madrassa, or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia\" Kuhner also claimed that the source said that the Clinton campaign was \"preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack Obama had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was six.\" Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", Kuhner refused to name the person said to be the reporter's source.\n\"Insight's\" story was reported on first by conservative &lt;a href=\"talk%20radio\"&gt;talk radio&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Fox%20News%20Channel\"&gt;Fox News Channel&lt;/a&gt;\", and then by \"The New York Times\" and other major newspapers. &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href=\"John%20Vause\"&gt;John Vause&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"State%20Elementary%20School%20Menteng%2001\"&gt;State Elementary School Menteng 01&lt;/a&gt;, a secular &lt;a href=\"Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29\"&gt;public school&lt;/a&gt; which Obama had attended for one year after attending a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; school for three, and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in his or her own faith. He was told by Hardi Priyono, deputy headmaster of the school, \"This is a public school. We don't focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment.\" Students at Besuki wore Western clothing, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Tribune\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\" described the school as \"so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;\". Interviews by &lt;a href=\"Nedra%20Pickler\"&gt;Nedra Pickler&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama's attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice principal of the school, told Pickler: \u201cThe allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone's welcome here ... it's a public school.\u201d"
