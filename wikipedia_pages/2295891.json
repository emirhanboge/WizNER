He attended the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a three-time All-American as a member of the &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; team. He turned professional in 1983.\nBrooks has seven wins on the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt;, including one &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1996%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1996 PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the U.S. &lt;a href=\"Presidents%20Cup\"&gt;Presidents Cup&lt;/a&gt; team in 1996.\nDuring his thirties, Brooks began a second career in &lt;a href=\"golf%20course%20design\"&gt;golf course design&lt;/a&gt;, and was a partner in the firm of Knott-Linn-Brooks House based in &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt;. His first major project, the Southern Oaks Golf Club outside Fort Worth, opened in 1999 and was highly acclaimed.

The solo 2nd-place finish was Brooks' best on any tour since his runner-up finish to &lt;a href=\"Retief%20Goosen\"&gt;Retief Goosen&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2001%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;2001 U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;.
