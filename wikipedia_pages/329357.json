    "title": "Mine, Yamaguchi",
    "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Cities%20of%20Japan\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Yamaguchi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Yamaguchi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. As of May 1, 2016, the city has an estimated &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; of 25,857 and a &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; of 54.70 persons per km2. The total area is 472.71\u00a0km2.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded on March 31, 1954 by a merger of municipalities that departed from &lt;a href=\"Mine%20District%2C%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Mine District&lt;/a&gt; (\"Mine-gun\"). \nOn March 21, 2008, Mine absorbed the rest of &lt;a href=\"Mine%20District%2C%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Mine District&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of towns &lt;a href=\"Mit%C5%8D%2C%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Mit\u014d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sh%C5%ABh%C5%8D%2C%20Yamaguchi\"&gt;Sh\u016bh\u014d&lt;/a&gt;, while the newly merged city retained the name, Mine.\nGeology.\nThe plateau consists of uplifted reef &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; age, which were thickened by &lt;a href=\"Fold%20%28geology%29\"&gt;overfolding&lt;/a&gt; during the Akiyoshidai orogenic movement. Subsequent erosion has created an undulating &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscape dimpled with many &lt;a href=\"Sinkhole\"&gt;doline&lt;/a&gt;s and countless limestone pinnacles up to two meters in height. Beneath the surface lie hundreds of caves, a few of them quite significant geologically.\nNumerous fossils of &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; age have been found in these caves, including those of the Japanese &lt;a href=\"rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stegodon\"&gt;Stegodon&lt;/a&gt;t elephant, &lt;a href=\"Naumann%20elephant\"&gt;Naumann elephant&lt;/a&gt;, Young &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous other animals from the last interglacial period.\nThe area around Akiyoshidai was once heavily forested about 500,000 years ago. In the &lt;a href=\"J%C5%8Dmon%20period\"&gt;J\u014dmon period&lt;/a&gt;, the area served as a hunting ground and the bottoms of &lt;a href=\"sinkhole\"&gt;sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;s as vegetable fields. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; artifacts have been recovered. As farming began in Japan, the local people eventually replaced the forested landscape with &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20pampas%20grass\"&gt;Japanese pampas grass&lt;/a&gt; for feeding their animals and thatching houses. Repeated cycles of burning the grass have kept trees from growing back since."
