    "text": "The River Alre (also, occasionally, Arle) is a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Itchen%2C%20Hampshire\"&gt;River Itchen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; in the south of England. It rises in &lt;a href=\"Bishop%27s%20Sutton\"&gt;Bishop's Sutton&lt;/a&gt; and flows west for to meet the Itchen below &lt;a href=\"New%20Alresford\"&gt;New Alresford&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe river is a classic English &lt;a href=\"chalk%20stream\"&gt;chalk stream&lt;/a&gt; with a shallow gravel bed and fast flowing waters, fed year-round by chalk springs. Through Bishop's Sutton it forms a good natural &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt; fishery and later supports a watercress harvest after which the &lt;a href=\"Watercress%20Line\"&gt;Watercress Line&lt;/a&gt;, a heritage steam railway, is named.\nCourse.\nThe river rises at a spring in the parish of &lt;a href=\"Bishop%27s%20Sutton\"&gt;Bishop's Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, 800 metres east of the old core of the village. Flowing west, the lesser-populated north bank of the village has the first of its three little crossings, Water Lane, a &lt;a href=\"Ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt;. Here the Alre runs between the parish church of St Nicholas and the site of the former bishop's palace, owned by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Bishop of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; for centuries, that gives the village its name.\nIt runs through Western Court Farm, where it provides the waters for the farm's &lt;a href=\"watercress\"&gt;watercress&lt;/a&gt; beds, and soon after it runs under the railway bridge of the Mid Hants Railway, known as the &lt;a href=\"Watercress%20Line\"&gt;Watercress Line&lt;/a&gt; as it used to transport watercress from &lt;a href=\"New%20Alresford\"&gt;New Alresford&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alton%2C%20Hampshire\"&gt;Alton&lt;/a&gt; and London.\nNorth east of Alresford, the river has been split with one channel running through the Old Alresford Pond, an artificial 12th-century stew pond that was dug to provide fish for the Bishop of Winchester. It may also have served as a balancing pond for a navigation channel dug to the south. It is now designated a &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alre runs just to the north of New Alresford, separating it from the smaller village of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Alresford\"&gt;Old Alresford&lt;/a&gt; and forming the parish boundary between the two for much of its route. Here it runs under two water mills, Arle Mill and The Fulling Mill, as well as supporting additional watercress farms. Fulling is the process of removing oils from wool and the mill dates back to the 13th century. Derelict by the 19th century, it was saved from demolition in 1951 and is now a private residence.\nIts final section flows a couple of hundred metres south west through fields into the meandering course of the River Itchen.\nHistory.\nThe river's name is derived from \"alor\" an Old English word for the &lt;a href=\"alder\"&gt;alder&lt;/a&gt; tree. The name Alresford dates from at least the start of the 8th century and means 'alder tree ford', presumably an important ford of the river near a prominent alder tree, and so by extension the whole river became known by the same name, with the river named after the town rather than the other way round.\nThe river is still sometimes referred to as the \"Arle\", but research suggests that this is due to 20th-century errors, rather than any earlier variation. The source of the confusion may be A J Robertson's 1937 book, \"History of Alresford\" incorrectly quoting Camden's 1586 \"Britannia\".\nOld English charter boundaries considered the River Alre to be the headwater of the Itchen. In addition, the Itchen itself was at one time referred to as the River Alre.\n&lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Defoe\"&gt;Daniel Defoe&lt;/a&gt; mentions the river in his book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20tour%20thro%27%20the%20whole%20island%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWater quality.\nThe Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"angiosperm\"&gt;angiosperm&lt;/a&gt;s and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.\nWater quality of the River Alre in 2019:"
