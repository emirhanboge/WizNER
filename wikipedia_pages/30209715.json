    "text": "The Naunspitze is a peak in the Zahmer Kaiser, the northern ridge of the &lt;a href=\"Kaiser%20Mountains\"&gt;Kaiser Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tyrol%20%28state%29\"&gt;Tyrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. Seen from the west it is the first independent summit on the main crest. To the south it falls sharply away and, to the north, ends abruptly in a steep rock face that towers over the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20valley\"&gt;Inn valley&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Ebbs\"&gt;Ebbs&lt;/a&gt;. The next peak along the main ridge to the east is the &lt;a href=\"Petersk%C3%B6pfl\"&gt;Petersk\u00f6pfl&lt;/a&gt; (1745m), which is separated from the Naunspitze by a small wind gap.\nAscents.\nThe Naunspitze may be reached without difficulty in about 45 minutes from the &lt;a href=\"Vorderkaiserfelden%20Hut\"&gt;Vorderkaiserfelden Hut&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, or in 20 minutes from the Petersk\u00f6pfl. Several Alpine climbing routes lead up the rock faces to the north and west classified by the &lt;a href=\"UIAA\"&gt;UIAA&lt;/a&gt; as grade III."
