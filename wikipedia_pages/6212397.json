    "text": "A spare wheel cover or spare tire cover is an accessory that covers the &lt;a href=\"Spare%20tire\"&gt;spare wheel&lt;/a&gt; mounted on external part of a car or van. On &lt;a href=\"4x4%20vehicles\"&gt;4x4 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; the spare wheel is normally rear mounted and is often printed with a dealer's name or something more fun. Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl covers. Spare wheel cover protects spare tires from the dirt and the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;'s harmful &lt;a href=\"UV%20rays\"&gt;UV rays&lt;/a&gt; in areas with many days of sunshine. Spare wheel covers need to be removed once in a while and cleaned. "
