    "text": "Wichita ( ) is the largest city in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sedgwick%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Sedgwick County&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;, the population of the city was 397,532. The Wichita metro area had a population of 647,610 in 2020. It is located in south-central Kansas on the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20River\"&gt;Arkansas River&lt;/a&gt;.\nWichita began as a trading post on the &lt;a href=\"Chisholm%20Trail\"&gt;Chisholm Trail&lt;/a&gt; in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Earp\"&gt;Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt; served as a police officer in Wichita for around one year before going to &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Dodge City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft\"&gt;Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cessna\"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stearman%20Aircraft\"&gt;Stearman Aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. The city became an aircraft production hub known as \"The Air Capital of the World\". &lt;a href=\"Textron%20Aviation\"&gt;Textron Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Learjet\"&gt;Learjet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20AeroSystems\"&gt;Spirit AeroSystems&lt;/a&gt; continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20industry\"&gt;aircraft industry&lt;/a&gt;. Several airports located within the city of Wichita include &lt;a href=\"McConnell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;McConnell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20James%20Jabara%20Airport\"&gt;Colonel James Jabara Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20National%20Airport\"&gt;Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the largest airport in Kansas.\nAs an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, shopping centers, and entertainment venues, most notably &lt;a href=\"Intrust%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Intrust Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Century%20II%20Convention%20Hall\"&gt;Century II Performing Arts &amp; Convention Center&lt;/a&gt;. The city's &lt;a href=\"Old%20Cowtown%20Museum\"&gt;Old Cowtown Museum&lt;/a&gt; maintains historical artifacts and exhibits the city's early history. &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20State%20University\"&gt;Wichita State University&lt;/a&gt; is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological evidence indicates human habitation near the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20River\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Arkansas%20River\"&gt;Little Arkansas River&lt;/a&gt;s, the site of present-day Wichita, as early as 3000 BC. In 1541, a &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; expedition led by explorer &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20V%C3%A1zquez%20de%20Coronado\"&gt;Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado&lt;/a&gt; found the area populated by the &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20people\"&gt;Quivira, or Wichita, people&lt;/a&gt;. Conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Osage%20Nation\"&gt;Osage&lt;/a&gt; in the 1750s drove the Wichita further south. Prior to &lt;a href=\"European%20settlement%20of%20North%20America\"&gt;European settlement&lt;/a&gt; of the region, the site was in the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Kiowa%20people\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century.\nClaimed first by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and later acquired by the United States with the &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20Purchase\"&gt;Louisiana Purchase&lt;/a&gt; in 1803, it became part of &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Territory\"&gt;Kansas Territory&lt;/a&gt; in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.\nThe Wichita people returned in 1863, driven from their land in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; forces in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and established a settlement on the banks of the Little Arkansas. During this period, trader &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Chisholm\"&gt;Jesse Chisholm&lt;/a&gt; established a trading post at the site, one of several along a trail extending south to &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Chisholm%20Trail\"&gt;Chisholm Trail&lt;/a&gt;. In 1867, after the war, the Wichita returned to Indian Territory.\nIn 1868, trader &lt;a href=\"James%20R.%20Mead%20%28pioneer%29\"&gt;James R. Mead&lt;/a&gt; was among a group of investors who established a town company, and surveyor Darius Munger built a log structure for the company to serve as a hotel, community center, and post office. Business opportunities attracted area hunters and traders, and a new settlement began to form. That summer, Mead and others organized the Wichita Town Company, naming the settlement after the Wichita tribe. In 1870, Munger and &lt;a href=\"German%20people\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; immigrant William \"Dutch Bill\" Greiffenstein filed plats laying out the city's first streets. Wichita formally &lt;a href=\"municipal%20corporation\"&gt;incorporated&lt;/a&gt; as a city on July 21, 1870.\nWichita's position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for &lt;a href=\"cattle%20drive\"&gt;cattle drive&lt;/a&gt;s traveling north from Texas to access railroads, which led to markets in eastern U.S. cities. The &lt;a href=\"Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway\"&gt;Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&lt;/a&gt; reached the city in 1872. As a result, Wichita became a railhead for the cattle drives, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". Across the Arkansas River, the town of &lt;a href=\"Delano%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Delano&lt;/a&gt; became an entertainment destination for cattlemen thanks to its saloons, brothels, and lack of law enforcement. The area had a reputation for violence until local lawmen, &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Earp\"&gt;Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt; among them, began to assertively police the cowboys. By the middle of the decade, the cattle trade had moved west to &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Dodge City&lt;/a&gt;. Wichita annexed Delano in 1880.\nRapid immigration resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Speculation\"&gt;speculative&lt;/a&gt; land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20State%20University\"&gt;Wichita State University&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became &lt;a href=\"Friends%20University\"&gt;Friends University&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1887. By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Kansas City, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Topeka%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Topeka&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of nearly 24,000. After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.\n20th century.\nIn 1914 and 1915, deposits of &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; were discovered in nearby &lt;a href=\"Butler%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Butler County&lt;/a&gt;. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city. By 1917, five operating refineries were in Wichita, with another seven built in the 1920s. The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded &lt;a href=\"Derby%20Oil\"&gt;Derby Oil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fred%20C.%20Koch\"&gt;Fred C. Koch&lt;/a&gt;, who established what would become &lt;a href=\"Koch%20Industries\"&gt;Koch Industries&lt;/a&gt;, both began in Wichita during this period.\nThe money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent &lt;a href=\"Aerospace%20manufacturer\"&gt;airplane-manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; industry. In 1917, &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20Cessna\"&gt;Clyde Cessna&lt;/a&gt; built his &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20Comet\"&gt;Cessna Comet&lt;/a&gt; in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; aircraft builder &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Matthew%20Laird\"&gt;Emil \"Matty\" Laird&lt;/a&gt; to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Swallow%20Airplane%20Company\"&gt;Swallow Airplane Company&lt;/a&gt;. Two early Swallow employees, &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20Stearman\"&gt;Lloyd Stearman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Beech\"&gt;Walter Beech&lt;/a&gt;, went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, &lt;a href=\"Stearman%20Aircraft\"&gt;Stearman Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 and &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft\"&gt;Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt; in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started &lt;a href=\"Cessna\"&gt;his own company&lt;/a&gt; in Wichita in 1927. The city became such a center of the industry that the &lt;a href=\"Aerospace%20Industries%20Association\"&gt;Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; dubbed it the \"Air Capital of the World\" in 1929.\nOver the following decades, aviation and aircraft manufacturing continued to drive expansion of the city. In 1934, Stearman's Wichita facilities became part of &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, which would become the city's largest employer. Initial construction of &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Aviation%20Museum\"&gt;Wichita Municipal Airport&lt;/a&gt; finished southeast of the city in 1935. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the site hosted Wichita Army Airfield and Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1. The city experienced a population explosion during the war when it became a major manufacturing center for the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress\"&gt;Boeing B-29&lt;/a&gt; bomber. In 1951, the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Air%20Force\"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to assume control of the airport to establish &lt;a href=\"McConnell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;McConnell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. By 1954, all nonmilitary air traffic had shifted to the new &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20National%20Airport\"&gt;Wichita Mid-Continent Airport&lt;/a&gt; west of the city. In 1962, &lt;a href=\"Learjet\"&gt;Lear Jet Corporation&lt;/a&gt; opened with its plant adjacent to the new airport.\nThroughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, several other prominent businesses and brands had their origins in Wichita. A. A. Hyde founded health-care products maker &lt;a href=\"Mentholatum\"&gt;Mentholatum&lt;/a&gt; in Wichita in 1889. Sporting goods and camping-gear retailer &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Company\"&gt;Coleman&lt;/a&gt; started in the city in the early 1900s. A number of &lt;a href=\"fast-food\"&gt;fast-food&lt;/a&gt; franchises started in Wichita, beginning with &lt;a href=\"White%20Castle%20%28restaurant%29\"&gt;White Castle&lt;/a&gt; in 1921 and followed by many more in the 1950s and 1960s including &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Hut\"&gt;Pizza Hut&lt;/a&gt; in 1958. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city became a regional center of health care and medical research.\nWichita has been a focal point of national political controversy multiple times in its history. In 1900, famous &lt;a href=\"Temperance%20movement\"&gt;temperance&lt;/a&gt; extremist &lt;a href=\"Carrie%20Nation\"&gt;Carrie Nation&lt;/a&gt; struck in Wichita upon learning the city was not enforcing Kansas's &lt;a href=\"prohibition\"&gt;prohibition&lt;/a&gt; ordinance. The &lt;a href=\"Dockum%20Drug%20Store%20sit-in\"&gt;Dockum Drug Store sit-in&lt;/a&gt; took place in the city in 1958 with protesters pushing for &lt;a href=\"desegregation\"&gt;desegregation&lt;/a&gt;. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters blockaded and held sit-ins at Wichita abortion clinics, particularly the clinic of &lt;a href=\"George%20Tiller\"&gt;George Tiller&lt;/a&gt;. Tiller was later killed in Wichita by &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20George%20Tiller\"&gt;Scott Roeder&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.\n21st century.\nExcept for a slow period in the 1970s, Wichita has continued to grow steadily into the 21st century. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city government and local organizations began collaborating to redevelop downtown Wichita and older neighborhoods in the city. &lt;a href=\"Intrust%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Intrust Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; opened downtown in 2010.\nBoeing ended its operations in Wichita in 2014. However, the city remains a national center of aircraft manufacturing with other companies including &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20AeroSystems\"&gt;Spirit AeroSystems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; maintaining facilities in Wichita.\nWichita Mid-Continent Airport was officially renamed Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport after the &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Kansas native and U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.\nGeography.\nWichita is in south-central Kansas at the junction of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035\"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2054\"&gt;U.S. Route 54&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwestern United States&lt;/a&gt;, it is north of &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20City\"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, and east-southeast of &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Hills\"&gt;Flint Hills&lt;/a&gt; in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;. The area's topography is characterized by the broad &lt;a href=\"alluvial%20plain\"&gt;alluvial plain&lt;/a&gt; of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side.\nThe Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries, all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies &lt;a href=\"Chisholm%20Creek\"&gt;Chisholm Creek&lt;/a&gt;, which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks, as well as further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Walnut%20River%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;Walnut River&lt;/a&gt;, flows south through the far eastern part of the city.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which are covered by water.\nAs the core of the &lt;a href=\"Wichita%2C%20KS%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Wichita metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, the city is surrounded by suburbs. Bordering Wichita on the north are, from west to east, &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Center%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Valley Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Park%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Park City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kechi%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Kechi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bel%20Aire%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Bel Aire&lt;/a&gt;. Enclosed within east-central Wichita is &lt;a href=\"Eastborough%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Eastborough&lt;/a&gt;. Adjacent to the city's east side is &lt;a href=\"Andover%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Andover&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"McConnell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;McConnell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; is in the extreme southeast corner of the city. To the south, from east to west, lie &lt;a href=\"Derby%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haysville%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Haysville&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Goddard%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Goddard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maize%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Maize&lt;/a&gt; border Wichita to the west and northwest, respectively.\nClimate.\nWichita lies within the &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; zone (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humid%20subtropical%20climate%23Breakdown%20of%20letters\"&gt;\"Cfa\"&lt;/a&gt;), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;, far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer. These occasionally bring large hail and frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history - in September 1965, during the &lt;a href=\"Andover%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;Andover, Kansas tornado outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of April 1991, and during the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Oklahoma%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;Oklahoma tornado outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of May 1999. Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s (\u00b0F), while cold-air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0\u00b0F. Wind speed in the city averages . On average, January is the coldest month (and the driest), July the hottest, and May the wettest.\nThe average temperature in the city is . Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds an average of 65 days a year and an average of 12 days a year. The minimum temperature falls to or below on an average 7.7 days a year. The hottest temperature recorded in Wichita was in 1936; the coldest temperature recorded was on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Blizzard%20of%201899\"&gt;February 12, 1899&lt;/a&gt;. Readings as low as and as high as occurred as recently as February 16, 2021 and &lt;a href=\"Summer%202012%20North%20American%20heat%20wave\"&gt;July 29\u201330, 2012&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Wichita receives on average about of precipitation a year, most of which falls in the warmer months, and experiences 87 days of measurable precipitation. The average &lt;a href=\"relative%20humidity\"&gt;relative humidity&lt;/a&gt; is 80% in the morning and 49% in the evening. Annual snowfall averages . Measurable snowfall occurs an average of nine days per year with at least an inch of snow falling on four of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 12 days per year. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 25 through April 9.\nNeighborhoods.\nWichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Wichita\"&gt;downtown area&lt;/a&gt; is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg, and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as &lt;a href=\"Century%20II%20Performing%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Century II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"250%20Douglas%20Place\"&gt;Garvey Center&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Center\"&gt;Epic Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.oldtownwichita.com/\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.\nTwo notable residential areas of Wichita are &lt;a href=\"Riverside%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Riverside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20Hill%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;College Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the Riverside Park. College Hill is east of downtown and south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with &lt;a href=\"Delano%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Delano&lt;/a&gt; on the west side and &lt;a href=\"Midtown%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Midtown&lt;/a&gt; in the north-central city.\nFour other historic neighborhoods\u2014developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20Aircraft\"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beech%20Aircraft\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt; aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; housing developments to support war factory personnel: Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.\nDemographics.\nIn terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 49th largest city in the United States, according to the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, 382,368 people, 151,818 households, and 94,862 families were residing in the city. The &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; was 2,304.8 per square mile (889.9/km). The 167,310 housing units had an average density of 1,022.1 per square mile (475.9/km). The racial makeup of the city was 71.9% &lt;a href=\"White%20American\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, 11.5% &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;, 4.8% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20American\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, 1.2% &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Indian&lt;/a&gt;, 0.1% &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islander%20American\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, 6.2% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans\"&gt;Hispanics and Latinos&lt;/a&gt; of any race were 15.3% of the population.\nOf the 151,818 households, 33.4% had children under 18 living with them, 44.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a male householder with no wife present, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were not families. About 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.48, and the average family size was 3.14.\nThe median age in the city was 33.9 years; 26.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.1% were between 18 and 24; 26.9% were from 25 to 44; 24.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11.5% were 65 or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.\nThe &lt;a href=\"median%20household%20income\"&gt;median income for a household&lt;/a&gt; in the city was $44,477, and for a family was $57,088. Males had a median income of $42,783 versus $32,155 for females. The &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the city was $24,517. About 12.1% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the &lt;a href=\"poverty%20line\"&gt;poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, including 22.5% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.\nMetropolitan area.\nWichita is the principal city of both the Wichita &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)&lt;/a&gt; and the Wichita-Winfield &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Combined Statistical Area (CSA)&lt;/a&gt;. The Wichita MSA encompasses Sedgwick, &lt;a href=\"Butler%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sumner%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Sumner&lt;/a&gt; counties and, as of 2010, had a population of 623,061, making it the 84th largest MSA in the United States.\nThe larger Wichita-Winfield CSA also includes &lt;a href=\"Cowley%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Cowley County&lt;/a&gt; and, as of 2013, had an estimated population of 673,598. Nearby &lt;a href=\"Reno%20County\"&gt;Reno County&lt;/a&gt; is not a part of the Wichita MSA or Wichita-Winfield CSA, but, were it included, it would add an additional population of 64,511 as of 2010.\nEconomy.\nIt is the birthplace of famous restaurants such as &lt;a href=\"White%20Castle%20%28restaurant%29\"&gt;White Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Hut\"&gt;Pizza Hut&lt;/a&gt;. A survey of well-known Kansas-based brands conducted by RSM Marketing Services and the Wichita Consumer Research Center showed many of the top-25 Kansas-based brands such as &lt;a href=\"Koch%20Industries\"&gt;Koch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Company\"&gt;Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cessna\"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt;, Pizza Hut, &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft\"&gt;Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freddy%27s%20Frozen%20Custard%20%26amp%3B%20Steakburgers\"&gt;Freddy's&lt;/a&gt;, and more are based in Wichita.\nWichita's principal &lt;a href=\"industrial%20sector\"&gt;industrial sector&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;, which accounted for 21.6% of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.\n&lt;a href=\"Healthcare\"&gt;Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing about 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical-care tower at &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Wesley Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita. Via Christi Hospital on St. Teresa is the system's fifth hospital to serve the Wichita community. In 2016, Wesley Healthcare opened Wesley Children's Hospital, the first and only children's hospital in the Wichita area.\nThanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Butler%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Butler County, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil-exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former &lt;a href=\"Derby%20Oil%20Company\"&gt;Derby Oil Company&lt;/a&gt;, which was purchased by &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Corporation\"&gt;Coastal Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. Wichita is home to oil and natural gas organizations Kansas Strong and Kansas Independent Oil &amp; Gas Association.\nKoch Industries and &lt;a href=\"Cargill\"&gt;Cargill&lt;/a&gt;, the two largest privately held companies in the United States, both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. &lt;a href=\"Cargill%20Meat%20Solutions\"&gt;Cargill Meat Solutions&lt;/a&gt; Div., at one time the nation's third-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Chance%20Morgan\"&gt;Chance Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, gourmet food retailer &lt;a href=\"Dean%20%26amp%3B%20Deluca\"&gt;Dean &amp; Deluca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20Energy%20Solutions\"&gt;Alternative Energy Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Company\"&gt;Coleman Company&lt;/a&gt;, a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. &lt;a href=\"Air%20Midwest\"&gt;Air Midwest&lt;/a&gt;, the nation's first officially certificated \"commuter\" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's eighth-largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.\nAs of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force; 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; and 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).\nThe cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0. As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.\nWichita has a national reputation in U.S. media as an affordable and pleasant place to live. In July 2006, &lt;a href=\"CNNMoney.com\"&gt;CNN/Money&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Money%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Money\"&lt;/a&gt; ranked Wichita ninth on their list of the 10 best U.S. big cities in which to live. In 2008, &lt;a href=\"MSN\"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; Real Estate ranked Wichita 1st on its list of most affordable cities. In its 2019 \"Best Places to Live\" survey, \"&lt;a href=\"U.%20S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U. S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;,\" ranked Wichita at number 79 out of 125 U.S. cities, and noted that violent crime in Wichita had risen over the previous few years. In the 2019 \"&lt;a href=\"KIDS%20COUNT%20Data%20Book\"&gt;KIDS COUNT Data Book&lt;/a&gt;,\" in its annual \"State Rankings on Overall Child Well-Being,\" Kansas was ranked number 15 out of the 50 states. However, the state has a significantly higher rate of child incarceration than the nation, generally, and a higher rate of the state taking children from their homes.\nAircraft manufacturing.\nFrom the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, Emil Matthew \"Matty\" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Beech\"&gt;Walter Beech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al%20Mooney\"&gt;Al Mooney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Lear\"&gt;Bill Lear&lt;/a&gt; began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that led to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations &lt;a href=\"Swallow%20Airplane%20Company\"&gt;E. M. Laird Aviation Company&lt;/a&gt; (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Air\"&gt;Travel Air&lt;/a&gt; (started by Beech, Stearman, and Cessna), &lt;a href=\"Stearman%20Aircraft\"&gt;Stearman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cessna\"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft\"&gt;Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mooney%20Airplane%20Company\"&gt;Mooney&lt;/a&gt; were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932. By 1931, &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating \"Boeing-Wichita\", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.\nToday, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita, having merged into &lt;a href=\"Textron%20Aviation\"&gt;Textron Aviation&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, along with &lt;a href=\"Learjet\"&gt;Learjet&lt;/a&gt; and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20AeroSystems\"&gt;Spirit AeroSystems&lt;/a&gt;. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and &lt;a href=\"Bombardier%20Aerospace\"&gt;Bombardier&lt;/a&gt; (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita, as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.\nIn the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after-effects of the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; to depress the aviation subsector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20Beechcraft\"&gt;Hawker Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raytheon\"&gt;Raytheon Aircraft Co.&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users. In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine &lt;a href=\"light%20aircraft\"&gt;light aircraft&lt;/a&gt; to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft. In early 2012, Boeing announced it would be closing its Wichita plant by the end of 2013, which paved the road for &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20AeroSystems\"&gt;Spirit Aerosystems&lt;/a&gt; to open its plant.\nArts and culture.\nWichita has a complex cultural mix, dominated by &lt;a href=\"Euro-American\"&gt;Euro-American&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue-collar\"&gt;blue-collar&lt;/a&gt; industrial and rural tastes, but embracing, to various degrees, classical arts and music, diverse domestic and foreign cultures (&lt;a href=\"Hispanic\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; cultural influences and activities are conspicuous), and &lt;a href=\"avant%20garde\"&gt;avant garde&lt;/a&gt; cultural activity.\nArts.\nWichita is a cultural center for Kansas, home to several art museums and performing arts groups. The &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;Wichita Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; is the largest art museum in the state of Kansas and contains 7,000 works in permanent collections. The Ulrich Museum of Art at &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20State%20University\"&gt;Wichita State University&lt;/a&gt; is a modern and contemporary art museum with over 6,300 works in its permanent collection.\nSmall art galleries are scattered around the city with some clustered in the districts of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%2C%20Wichita\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delano%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Delano&lt;/a&gt; and south Commerce street. These galleries started the Final Friday Gallery crawl event, where visitors tour attractions free in the evening on the last Friday of each month. Larger museums began participating and staying open late on Final Fridays shortly after its beginning.\nMusic.\nWichita is the music hub of central Kansas, and draws major acts from around the world, performing at various concert halls, arenas, and stadiums around the area. Most major rock'n'roll and pop-music stars, and virtually all country music stars, perform there during their career.\n&lt;a href=\"Music%20Theatre%20Wichita\"&gt;Music Theatre Wichita&lt;/a&gt;, Wichita Grand Opera (both nationally renowned), and the &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Wichita Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; perform regularly at the &lt;a href=\"Century%20II%20Convention%20Hall\"&gt;Century II Convention Hall&lt;/a&gt; downtown. Concerts are also regularly performed by the nationally noted schools of music at Wichita's two largest universities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orpheum%20Theatre%20%28Wichita%29\"&gt;Orpheum Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a classic &lt;a href=\"movie%20palace\"&gt;movie palace&lt;/a&gt; built in 1922, serves as a downtown venue for smaller shows.\nEvents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20River%20Festival\"&gt;Wichita River Festival&lt;/a&gt; has been held in the Downtown and Old Town areas of the city since 1972. It has featured events, musical entertainment, sporting events, traveling exhibits, cultural and historical activities, &lt;a href=\"play%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt;, interactive children's events, a &lt;a href=\"flea%20market\"&gt;flea market&lt;/a&gt;, river events, a &lt;a href=\"parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block%20parties\"&gt;block parties&lt;/a&gt;, a food court, &lt;a href=\"fireworks\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"souvenir\"&gt;souvenir&lt;/a&gt;s for the roughly 370,000+ patrons who attend each year. In 2011, the festival was moved from May to June because of rain during previous festivals. The Wichita River Festival has seen immense growth, with record numbers in 2016 and again in 2018. Much of that growth is attributed to attractive musical acts at the festival. The upcoming 2021 Wichita River Festival is slated to occur from June 4\u201312, 2021.\nThe annual Wichita Black Arts Festival, held in the spring, celebrates the arts, crafts, and creativity of Wichita's large African-American community. It usually takes place in Central-Northeast Wichita. A &lt;a href=\"Juneteenth\"&gt;Juneteenth&lt;/a&gt; event and parade also are common annual events.\nThe International Student Association at &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20State%20University\"&gt;Wichita State University&lt;/a&gt; presents an annual international cultural exhibition and food festival, on the campus at WSU, providing an inexpensive sampling of global culture and cuisine to the general public.\nOne or more large &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20fair\"&gt;Renaissance fair&lt;/a&gt;s occur annually, including the \"RenFair\" in conjunction with the \"Kingdom of Calontir\" of the SCA (&lt;a href=\"Society%20for%20Creative%20Anachronism\"&gt;Society for Creative Anachronism&lt;/a&gt;). The fairs vary in length from one day to a week, typically at Sedgwick County Park or &lt;a href=\"Newman%20University%2C%20Wichita\"&gt;Newman University&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Wichita Public Library&lt;/a&gt;'s Academy Awards Shorts program is reportedly the oldest annual, complete, free public screening outside of Hollywood of the full array of &lt;a href=\"short%20film\"&gt;short film&lt;/a&gt;s nominated for an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Award (\"Oscar\")&lt;/a&gt;. In late winter, shortly before the Academy Awards ceremonies, the films\u2014including all nominated documentary, live action, and animated shorts\u2014are presented, free, at the Library and in local theaters and other venues around Wichita. Wichita's former Congressman, &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20Association\"&gt;Motion Picture Association&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Glickman\"&gt;Dan Glickman&lt;/a&gt;, has served as Honorary Chair of the event, and some of the filmmakers have attended and visited with the audiences.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tallgrass%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Tallgrass Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; has been held in downtown Wichita since 2003. It draws over 100 independent feature and short films from all over the world for three days each October. Notable people from the entertainment industry have attended the festival.\nAviation-related events are common in the Wichita area, including &lt;a href=\"air%20show\"&gt;air show&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fly-in\"&gt;fly-in&lt;/a&gt;s, air races, aviation conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows. The city's two main air shows, which are generally held in alternating years, are the city-sponsored civilian Wichita Flight Festival (originally the \"Kansas Flight Festival\") and the military-sponsored McConnell Air Force Base Open House and Airshow. Both are large regional air shows with famous acts and multimillion-dollar aircraft displays (including many Wichita-built aircraft). In addition, numerous local, regional, and national aviation organizations host fly-ins, conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows in the Wichita area on irregular schedules.\nPoints of interest.\nMuseums and landmarks devoted to science, culture, and area history are located throughout the city. Several lie along the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20River\"&gt;Arkansas River&lt;/a&gt; west of downtown, including the &lt;a href=\"Exploration%20Place\"&gt;Exploration Place&lt;/a&gt; science and discovery center, the &lt;a href=\"Mid-America%20All-Indian%20Center\"&gt;Mid-America All-Indian Center&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Cowtown%20Museum\"&gt;Old Cowtown&lt;/a&gt; living history museum, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Keeper%20of%20the%20Plains\"&gt;The Keeper of the Plains&lt;/a&gt; statue and its associated display highlighting the daily lives of &lt;a href=\"Plains%20Indians\"&gt;Plains Indians&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wichita-Sedgwick%20County%20Historical%20Museum\"&gt;Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Wichita occupies the original Wichita city hall, built in 1892. The museum contains artifacts that tell the story of Wichita and Sedgwick County starting from 1865 and continuing to the present day. Nearby is the 1913 &lt;a href=\"Sedgwick%20County%20Memorial%20Hall%20and%20Soldiers%20and%20Sailors%20Monument\"&gt;Sedgwick County Memorial Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Monument&lt;/a&gt;. East of downtown is the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20World%20Treasures\"&gt;Museum of World Treasures&lt;/a&gt; and railroad-oriented &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains%20Transportation%20Museum\"&gt;Great Plains Transportation Museum&lt;/a&gt;. The Coleman Factory Outlet and Museum was at 235 N St. Francis street and was the home of the &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Lantern\"&gt;Coleman Lantern&lt;/a&gt; until it closed in 2018. Wichita State University hosts the &lt;a href=\"Lowell%20D.%20Holmes%20Museum%20of%20Anthropology\"&gt;Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Aviation%20Museum\"&gt;Kansas Aviation Museum&lt;/a&gt;, housed in the Terminal and Administration building of the former Municipal Airport, is in southeast Wichita adjacent to &lt;a href=\"McConnell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;McConnell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. The Original &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20Hut\"&gt;Pizza Hut&lt;/a&gt; Museum is also located on the Wichita State University campus for pizza lovers and fans to visit.\n&lt;a href=\"Botanica%2C%20The%20Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Botanica, The Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, also along the Arkansas River, has 24 themed gardens including the Butterfly Garden and the award-winning Sally Stone Sensory Garden. The &lt;a href=\"Sedgwick%20County%20Zoo\"&gt;Sedgwick County Zoo&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest part of Wichita is the most popular outdoor tourist attraction in the state of Kansas, and is home to more than 2,500 animals representing 500 different species. The zoo is next to Sedgwick County Park and the &lt;a href=\"Sedgwick%20County%20Extension%20Arboretum\"&gt;Sedgwick County Extension Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Intrust%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Intrust Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; is the city's primary event venue, featuring 22 suites, 2 party suites, 40 loge boxes and over 300 premium seats with a total potential capacity of over 15,000. This arena in the middle of Wichita opened in January 2010.\nLocated immediately east of downtown is Old Town, the city's entertainment district. In the early 1990s, developers transformed it from an old &lt;a href=\"warehouse%20district\"&gt;warehouse district&lt;/a&gt; into a mixed-zone neighborhood with residential space, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and museums.\nMoody's Skidrow Beanery, at 625 E. Douglas in what was to become Old Town, was one of the more famous places in Wichita in the 1960s. It was the scene of a nationally followed First Amendment struggle and was visited by Allen Ginsberg in 1966 (the name had been changed to the Magic Theatre Vortex Art Gallery) where he first read his long poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra.\"\nWichita is also home to two major indoor shopping malls: &lt;a href=\"Towne%20East%20Square\"&gt;Towne East Square&lt;/a&gt;, managed by &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Property%20Group\"&gt;Simon Property Group&lt;/a&gt;, and Towne West Square. Towne East is home to four anchor stores and has more than 100 tenants. Towne West Square, which has was put into foreclosure in 2019, is still operational as of 2021. The oldest mall, Wichita Mall, was for many years largely a &lt;a href=\"dead%20mall\"&gt;dead mall&lt;/a&gt;, but has since been converted into office space. There are also two large outdoor shopping centers, Bradley Fair (which hosts jazz concerts and art festivals) located on the city's northeast side and &lt;a href=\"New%20Market%20Square\"&gt;New Market Square&lt;/a&gt; located on the city's northwest side. Each establishment consists of over 50 stores spread out on several acres.\nIn 1936, the Wichita post office contained two oil-on-canvas murals, \"Kansas Farming\", painted by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Haines\"&gt;Richard Haines&lt;/a&gt; and \"Pioneer in Kansas\" by Ward Lockwood. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the &lt;a href=\"Section%20of%20Painting%20and%20Sculpture\"&gt;Section of Painting and Sculpture&lt;/a&gt;, later called the &lt;a href=\"Section%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Section of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury\"&gt;Treasury Department&lt;/a&gt;. The post office building became &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Post%20Office%20and%20Federal%20Building%20%28Wichita%2C%20Kansas%29\"&gt;the Federal Courthouse&lt;/a&gt; at 401 N. Market Street and the murals are on display in the lobby.\nWichita also has a number of parks and recreational areas such as Riverside Park, College Hill Park, and &lt;a href=\"McAdams%20Park\"&gt;McAdams Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nLibraries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Wichita Public Library&lt;/a&gt; is the city's library system, presently consisting of a central facility, the Advanced Learning Library in &lt;a href=\"Delano%2C%20Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Delano&lt;/a&gt; and six branch locations in other neighborhoods around the city. The library operates several free programs for the public, including special events, technology training classes, and programs specifically for adults, children, and families. As of 2009, its holdings included more than 1.3 million books and 2.2 million items total.\nIn popular culture and the arts.\nWichita is mentioned in the songs \"&lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Lineman\"&gt;Wichita Lineman&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Lineman%20%28album%29\"&gt;album of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Campbell\"&gt;Glenn Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, \"Wichita Skyline\" by &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Colvin\"&gt;Shawn Colvin&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ve%20Been%20Everywhere%23North%20American%20version\"&gt;I've Been Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Snow\"&gt;Hank Snow&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"Seven%20Nation%20Army\"&gt;Seven Nation Army&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stripes\"&gt;White Stripes&lt;/a&gt;. Jazz musicians, &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Metheny\"&gt;Pat Metheny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyle%20Mays\"&gt;Lyle Mays&lt;/a&gt; released a collaborative album titled, \"As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls\" in 1981, which includes a title track that is just under 21 minutes long.

In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.\nAs a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the &lt;a href=\"Wichita-Valley%20Center%20Floodway\"&gt;Wichita-Valley Center Floodway&lt;/a&gt; (locally known as the \"Big Ditch\") was conceived. The project was completed in 1958. The Big Ditch diverts part of the Arkansas River's flow around west-central Wichita, running roughly parallel to the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20235%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;Interstate 235&lt;/a&gt; bypass. A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20135\"&gt;Interstate 135&lt;/a&gt;, running south through the central part of the city. Chisholm Creek is diverted into this canal for most of its length. The city's flood defenses were tested in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Flood%20of%201993\"&gt;Great Flood of 1993&lt;/a&gt;. Flooding that year kept the Big Ditch full for more than a month and caused $6 million of damage to the flood control infrastructure. The damage was not fully repaired until 2007. In 2019, the Floodway was renamed the &lt;a href=\"MS%20Mitch%20Mitchell%20Floodway\"&gt;MS Mitch Mitchell Floodway&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the man credited for its creation.\nUtilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Evergy\"&gt;Evergy&lt;/a&gt; provides electricity. &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Gas%20Service\"&gt;Kansas Gas Service&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;.
