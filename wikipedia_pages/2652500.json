    "text": "Mullum Mullum Creek is a &lt;a href=\"Stream\"&gt;creek&lt;/a&gt; in the outer eastern &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It is the main watercourse of the Mullum Mullum Valley, a &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20River\"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20Valley\"&gt;Yarra Valley&lt;/a&gt;. For tens of thousands of years it was used as a &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; source &lt;a href=\"sustainability\"&gt;sustainably&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Wurundjeri\"&gt;Wurundjeri&lt;/a&gt; people, &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kulin%20people\"&gt;Kulin&lt;/a&gt; nation, who spoke variations of the &lt;a href=\"Woiwurrung\"&gt;Woiwurrung&lt;/a&gt; language group.\nIt is one of the only watercourses lying within urban metropolitan Melbourne that is surrounded by native and regenerated bushland for almost its entire length, and is a significant remnant ecosystem in Melbourne. Around 80,000 people live in the creek's catchment area. The remnant bushland across its length provides habitat for significant species such as &lt;a href=\"platypus\"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rakali\"&gt;rakali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"koalas\"&gt;koalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"powerful%20owl\"&gt;powerful owl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nankeen%20night%20heron\"&gt;nankeen night heron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"white-winged%20chough\"&gt;white-winged chough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yellow-tailed%20black%20cockatoo\"&gt;yellow-tailed black cockatoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn recent decades the creek and valley have been central in many of the issues in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, such as; residential &lt;a href=\"housing%20estate\"&gt;housing estate&lt;/a&gt;s, regeneration of native vegetation and most recently, &lt;a href=\"Tollway\"&gt;Tollway&lt;/a&gt; construction. The &lt;a href=\"EastLink%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Eastlink Tollway&lt;/a&gt; passes underneath the valley through 1.5-km of tunnels to avoid disturbing the remnant ecosystem through the Mullum Mullum Gorge, however through Ringwood, it crosses the creek above ground, resulting in the relocation of the creek through this area.\nEtymology.\n\"Mullum Mullum\" is adapted from &lt;a href=\"Woiwurrung\"&gt;Woiwurrung&lt;/a&gt; language and is thought to mean \"place of many big birds\" and led many historians to conclude that it meant \"Place of Eagles\". Many other interpretations have been suggested including; \"place of many big swifts\" or \"place of many big owls\" perhaps in reference to the powerful owls of the valley. Some historians suspect \"Mullum Mullum\" to be a mistranslation of another Wurundjeri expression \"Ballum Ballum\" meaning \"place of many butterflies\". Around the higher grassy woodlands there are large numbers of &lt;a href=\"butterfly\"&gt;butterfly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; species breeding in the grasslands, many of which have not yet been documented.\nGeography and ecology.\nThe creek flows for through the Mullum Mullum Valley travelling west and then north where it flows into the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20River\"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt;. It passes through many of Melbourne's eastern suburbs including; &lt;a href=\"Croydon%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ringwood%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Ringwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitcham%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Mitcham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donvale%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Donvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Doncaster%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;East Doncaster&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href=\"Warrandyte\"&gt;Warrandyte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Templestowe\"&gt;Templestowe&lt;/a&gt;. It is most often a slight green/brown colour due to the riverbed silt, during heavy rainfall it appears light brown. Its geography is generally divided up into 4 sections; The High Plateau Tract, The Mullum Mullum Gorge, The Valley Tract and The Plains Tract.\nHigh Plateau Tract.\n\"Through: &lt;a href=\"Croydon%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ringwood%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Ringwood&lt;/a&gt;\"\nA ring of high forested hills that separates the &lt;a href=\"Dandenong\"&gt;Dandenong&lt;/a&gt; Valley from the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20Valley\"&gt;Yarra Valley&lt;/a&gt; is the source of the Mullum Mullum Creek. The high plateau is formed by the Wicklow Ridge to Reagh's Hill in the east, Bedford Road and &lt;a href=\"Maroondah%20Highway\"&gt;Maroondah Highway&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and the Loughnan's Hill, Wonga Road ridge to the west. Commencing in Croydon south of Birt's Hill behind the Yarra Valley School, the Mullum Mullum Creek flows south downstream passing remnant &lt;a href=\"orchards\"&gt;orchards&lt;/a&gt;, bushland and parks through Ringwood and past Eastland Shopping Centre. Native hyacinth orchids and small grass trees are present in these remnant forests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"rakali\"&gt;rakali&lt;/a&gt; feeds in the stream here. Grassy, sedgy woodlands here are home to many undocumented species of butterflies as well as birds and &lt;a href=\"Phalangeriformes\"&gt;possums&lt;/a&gt;. Drier mixed species forests gradually give way to swamp gums and &lt;a href=\"manna%20gum\"&gt;manna gum&lt;/a&gt;s as the creek heads south. Near New Street, the creek once turned and flowed south of Maroondah Highway down the now dry bed of the upper Heatherdale Creek and into the &lt;a href=\"Dandenong%20Creek\"&gt;Dandenong Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Philip%20Bay\"&gt;Port Philip Bay&lt;/a&gt;, but a natural 'river capture' has now taken the waters of the creek and diverted them through a narrow gap in the hills to the north and the Yarra River.\nMullum Mullum Gorge.\n\"Through: &lt;a href=\"Ringwood%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Ringwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitcham%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Mitcham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Park%20Orchards\"&gt;Park Orchards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donvale%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Donvale&lt;/a&gt;\"\nWith the extra captured water, the Mullum Mullum Creek has carved a steep \"V\" shaped gorge with rocky cascades. Here in the damp shadows, tall old growth &lt;a href=\"riparian\"&gt;riparian&lt;/a&gt; forests provide habitat for koalas and native birds species. &lt;a href=\"Maidenhair%20fern\"&gt;Maidenhair fern&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tree%20ferns\"&gt;tree ferns&lt;/a&gt; thrive. The drier hillsides are home to native &lt;a href=\"orchids\"&gt;orchids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"echidnas\"&gt;echidnas&lt;/a&gt;. Passing under the steep bushland escarpment below Poynton Avenue in Ringwood, the rocky cascades and fern covered banks of the Mullum Mullum gorge become apparent. Tall manna gum woodlands, some with treefern &lt;a href=\"understorey\"&gt;understorey&lt;/a&gt;, are home to &lt;a href=\"tawny%20frogmouth\"&gt;tawny frogmouth&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sugar%20glider\"&gt;sugar glider&lt;/a&gt;s. Near &lt;a href=\"Schwerkolt%20Cottage\"&gt;Schwerkolt Cottage&lt;/a&gt;, the rocky cascades are bordered by drier open grassy woodlands, rare Valley Heathy Forest rich with native orchids, particularly near Antonio Park, Yarran Dheran, the Hillcrest area at Mitcham, and the Chaim Court bushland and pipe-track at Donvale.\nThe tall ancient manna gum forests near &lt;a href=\"Whitefriars%20College\"&gt;Whitefriars College&lt;/a&gt; are home to &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s (who nest on the tops of old stags) crimson &lt;a href=\"rosella\"&gt;rosella&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"galah\"&gt;galah&lt;/a&gt;s and other parrots (who nest in old hollows), rare large powerful owls and &lt;a href=\"rainbow%20lorikeet\"&gt;rainbow lorikeet&lt;/a&gt;s. Pied &lt;a href=\"cormorant\"&gt;cormorant&lt;/a&gt;s and night &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s cruise the creek pools. Rakali and the occasional &lt;a href=\"platypus\"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt;, fish for &lt;a href=\"Common%20galaxias\"&gt;galaxias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gudgeon%20%28fish%29\"&gt;gudgeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20yabby\"&gt;yabbies&lt;/a&gt;. There are signs of &lt;a href=\"wombat\"&gt;wombat&lt;/a&gt; diggings on the hill face but they are rarely seen. The occasional swamp &lt;a href=\"wallaby\"&gt;wallaby&lt;/a&gt; and eastern grey &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt; visit the gorge. In warm weather &lt;a href=\"skink\"&gt;skink&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blue%20tongue%20lizard\"&gt;blue tongue lizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"copperhead%20snake\"&gt;copperhead snake&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen. Other rarely seen species include marbled &lt;a href=\"geckos\"&gt;geckos&lt;/a&gt; and white-lipped snakes.\nValley Tract.\n\"Through: &lt;a href=\"Donvale%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Donvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20East%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Doncaster East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrandyte\"&gt;Warrandyte&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAt Park Road in &lt;a href=\"Park%20Orchards\"&gt;Park Orchards&lt;/a&gt; the valley begins to open up. Here many small tributaries join the Mullum Mullum Creek. Loughnan's Creek connects to Loughie's Bushland and B.J. Hubbard Bushland Reserves in Ringwood North, and many green corridors and urban pathways link to the Mullum Mullum Creek bushland parks on the west. Pockets of good bushland such as the girl guides camp in McGowans Road provide refuge to koalas and tawny frogmouths. Rare &lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus%20melliodora\"&gt;yellow box&lt;/a&gt; open woodlands with &lt;a href=\"kangaroo%20grass\"&gt;kangaroo grass&lt;/a&gt; understorey to the east help protect the resident kangaroos and the breeding white-winged choughs. The higher ground in Park Orchards provides views to the dividing ranges and Mount Macedon and glimpses of the Yarra Valley to the north. Old gold mines in this area are home to &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; colonies.\nThe rural areas of Park Orchards, the bushland from Tindalls Road to Reynolds Road, the Currawong Bush Park, the regenerated bushland near Larnoo Drive at Donvale all provide wonderful bushland habitat and a very significant linear open space. Small tributaries with wetlands, ferns and &lt;a href=\"growling%20grass%20frog\"&gt;growling grass frog&lt;/a&gt;s link to the Mullum at Currawong Bush Park. Kangaroos, koalas and echidnas are permanent residents in the area, and platypus live in the Creek. The last major tributary, that forms the valley of the Green Gully Linear Park, joins the Mullum Mullum Creek, near Tikalara Park, just opposite the new parklands within the subdivision as the end of Blackburn Road.\nPlains Tract.\n\"Through: &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20East%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Doncaster East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Templestowe\"&gt;Templestowe&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNorth of the &lt;a href=\"Route%202%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road&lt;/a&gt; the creek slowly winds its way towards the Yarra River in &lt;a href=\"Templestowe\"&gt;Templestowe&lt;/a&gt;. Where the Mullum Mullum meets the Yarra, is also where Wurundjeri and European Cultures meet. Tikalara Park, the next stage of the Yarra Valley Metropolitan Park upstream from &lt;a href=\"Petty%27s%20Orchard\"&gt;Petty's Orchard&lt;/a&gt;, is particularly a place of significance for the Wurundjeri. Here ancient scar trees and scatter sites provide physical evidence to support the documented evidence that this area was a clan meeting place of the Wurundjeri.\nPontville homestead on the Mullum Mullum Creek near the Yarra River is a site of state historic significance for its associations with early European settlement, and it is a known site of conflict between European and Wurundjeri cultures. The plains where the Mullum Mullum flows into the Yarra are home to kangaroos, &lt;a href=\"Wallaby\"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt;, wombats and is a known platypus breeding ground. The Australian Platypus Conservancy has been studying the significant population of platypus in this area, and their research has confirmed that the Mullum Mullum Creek provides habitat for the highest density of platypus in the whole of the Yarra River catchment.\nSettlements.\nApproximately 70\u201380,000 people live in the creek's catchment area. The settlements located along its course are listed below, from downstream to upstream;\nHistory.\nThe creek and valley is hypothesised to have been used by &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt; as a route from modern day Melbourne to &lt;a href=\"Warrandyte\"&gt;Warrandyte&lt;/a&gt;. Early European settlement occupied well watered open grassy woodlands on either side of the ridge lines, along the main roads and railway lines, and the more open valleys. &lt;a href=\"Orchards\"&gt;Orchards&lt;/a&gt; were established on the higher plateaus of Ringwood, Croydon, Park Orchards, and Templestowe.\nThe natural significance of the valley was recognised early by Naturalists who made excursions to Mitcham to see the remarkable bushlands and rich wildflower displays. In the 1920s and the 1930s it was proposed that the Mullum Mullum Valley should become protected bush parkland, but the remnant bushlands were not threatened by development, the scenery was not spectacular and society at the time had other priorities. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, more people made excursions and day trips to Mitcham, and to Loughnan's Hill and Louhnan's Lake in Ringwood North to enjoy the views and the wonderful bushlands.\nBy 1946, local town planning schemes again proposed protection of this bushland as parkland, but local planning schemes were being brought together under the MMBW Metropolitan Planning Scheme.\nIn 1954, this scheme first proposed a series of \"parkway\" roads along our creek valleys, which were made obsolete in the 1969 Melbourne transport plan. Many local residents who chose, in the 1930s and 1940s, to establish their residences next to these bushland, have been fighting for more than 50 years to protect these bushlands from development.\nParklands and recreation.\nParks Victoria operate several areas of designated parkland adjoining the Mullum Mullum Creek. Much of this parkland, particularly in the Open Valley Tract was replanted and regenerated, whilst other areas are remnant native bushland. The &lt;a href=\"Mullum%20Mullum%20Creek%20Trail\"&gt;Mullum Mullum Creek Trail&lt;/a&gt; runs through much of this parkland giving cyclists through access to the entire valley. Below is a list of parks adjoining the creek in order from its origin to where it flows into the Yarra River. Adjoining geographic features are shown in bold.\nMost of these parklands contain paths or trails, many of which are shared use (pedestrian/cycling). The Mullum Mullum Creek Linear Park follows the course of the creek in the Open Valley Tract between Doncaster East and Donvale, this is where the &lt;a href=\"Mullum%20Mullum%20Creek%20Trail\"&gt;Mullum Mullum Creek Trail&lt;/a&gt; runs beside the creek. Bicycle trails upstream include the Mullum Mullum Valley Path through the gorge and a trail through Ringwood into Croydon beside the creek.\nCrossings.\nThere are many crossings of the Mullum Mullum Creek including around 15 footbridges, many of which are not included in this list as they are only small local pedestrian bridges:\nTollway tunnels.\nFrom 2006\u20132008 &lt;a href=\"EastLink%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Eastlink&lt;/a&gt; was built, a major tollway servicing Melbourne's eastern and south-eastern suburbs. Eastlink crosses the Mullum Mullum Creek and Valley in Ringwood and Donvale. During the planning stages several proposals were considered for how this crossing would be made, some of which included a 3\u00a0km tunnel to go under the entire valley and a surface freeway requiring the destruction of the natural environment. The state government decided on a compromise and two 1.5-km tunnels were subsequently built under the creek and valley. The eastbound tunnel was named after the creek, the other being named after &lt;a href=\"Nellie%20Melba\"&gt;Dame Nellie Melba&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe irony of the situation was that the primary reason this section of the creek was in so natural a state was that it had been protected from other development through the land having been reserved for the section of the proposed F35 Scoresby Freeway (Renamed Eastlink) to join the end of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Freeway%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;Eastern Freeway&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"1969%20Melbourne%20Transportation%20Plan\"&gt;1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan&lt;/a&gt;.\nPollution.\nThe Mullum Mullum Creek suffers from many of the problems inherent in the development of urban environments and pollution in and around the creek is unfortunately quite prominent. Two of the most significant problems affecting the creek is sewage spills after heavy rain and leakage of &lt;a href=\"septic%20tank\"&gt;septic tank effluent&lt;/a&gt; from residential properties into watercourses and subsequently, the creek itself. This is a problem that extends to the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20River\"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt; and has become a major issue affecting the ecology of central &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and state politics.\nIn 2005, three kayakers contracted &lt;a href=\"leptospirosis\"&gt;leptospirosis&lt;/a&gt; and suffered bouts of delusion and lung hemorrhaging after swallowing Yarra river water. Tests were conducted in the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20River\"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt; and the Mullum Mullum Creek and the levels of many &lt;a href=\"pathogens\"&gt;pathogens&lt;/a&gt; were found to have breached local and international standards for recreational water. This is documented in a 2007 report by &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Protection%20Authority%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;EPA Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in which levels of Human faecal matter and &lt;a href=\"Escherichia%20coli\"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt; were recorded and documented. Other major pollutants entering the creek via stormwater drains and surface runoff include dog &lt;a href=\"feces\"&gt;feces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cigarette\"&gt;cigarette butts&lt;/a&gt;, packaging and other &lt;a href=\"post-consumer%20waste\"&gt;post-consumer waste&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolid pollution.\nIn terms of hard pollution, plastics like bags and packaging are most common, they catch in the trees at the high-water mark on the creek banks, tires are also particularly common as well as other car parts such as batteries and pieces of metal. Large pieces of concrete somehow find their way into the creek at various locations and sit amongst the rocks almost blending in if it weren't for the exposed aggregate. Clothing is also common, particularly synthetic items such as gloves, shoes and bags, while clothing such as shirts made from organic materials break down into the environment.\nOther information.\nMany surrounding features, structures and parks borrow their names from the creek:"
