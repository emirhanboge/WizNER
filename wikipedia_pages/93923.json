    "text": "Cheam () is a commuter suburb now in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Sutton\"&gt;London Borough of Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, England, south-west of &lt;a href=\"Charing%20Cross\"&gt;Charing Cross&lt;/a&gt;. It divides into North Cheam, Cheam Village and South Cheam. Cheam Village contains the &lt;a href=\"listed%20buildings\"&gt;listed buildings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lumley%20Chapel\"&gt;Lumley Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and the 16th-century &lt;a href=\"Whitehall%2C%20Cheam\"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt;. It is adjacent to two large parks, &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Park\"&gt;Nonsuch Park&lt;/a&gt; and Cheam Park. Nonsuch Park contains the listed &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Mansion\"&gt;Nonsuch Mansion&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of Cheam Park and Cheam Village are in a &lt;a href=\"conservation%20area\"&gt;conservation area&lt;/a&gt;. Cheam is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Park\"&gt;Worcester Park&lt;/a&gt; to the north-west, &lt;a href=\"Morden\"&gt;Morden&lt;/a&gt; to the north-east, &lt;a href=\"Sutton%2C%20London\"&gt;Sutton&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Ewell\"&gt;Ewell&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Banstead\"&gt;Banstead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belmont%2C%20Sutton\"&gt;Belmont&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nHistory.\nThe Roman road of &lt;a href=\"Stane%20Street%20%28Chichester%29\"&gt;Stane Street&lt;/a&gt; forms part of the boundary of Cheam. The modern London Road at North Cheam follows the course of the Roman road through the area. It is designated &lt;a href=\"A24%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A24&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe village lay within the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; administrative division of &lt;a href=\"Wallington%20%28hundred%29\"&gt;Wallington&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hundred%20%28division%29\"&gt;hundred&lt;/a&gt;. Cheam is mentioned in the Charters of &lt;a href=\"Chertsey%20Abbey\"&gt;Chertsey Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in 727, which mentions Cheam being given to the monastery of Chertsey in 675; the name appears as \"Cegeham\". However, the Charters are of dubious origin and are now regarded as obvious fabrications. The name 'Cheam', based on \"Cegeham\", may mean 'village or homestead by the tree-stumps'.\nCheam appears in &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; as \"Ceiham\". Held by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lanfranc\"&gt;Archbishop Lanfranc&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Canterbury\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, its Domesday assets were four &lt;a href=\"hide%20%28unit%29\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;s, one church, 17 &lt;a href=\"plough\"&gt;plough&lt;/a&gt;s, of &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt; worth 25 &lt;a href=\"hog%20%28swine%29\"&gt;hog&lt;/a&gt;s. It rendered \u00a314.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, Cheam had potteries, and recent excavations have been carried out by archaeologists. In 1259, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry III of England&lt;/a&gt; made Cheam a town by charter. In 1538, part of Cheam was handed over to &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt;. The same year, Henry began work on &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Palace\"&gt;Nonsuch Palace&lt;/a&gt;, which he decorated elaborately. This was later sold and demolished.\nIn 1801, the time of the first census, Cheam had a population of 616 Cheamonians. Records of Cheam Charter Fair date back to the 1800s, when a fairground accompanied the market.\nCheam was the original home of &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20School\"&gt;Cheam School&lt;/a&gt; which was formed in Whitehall in 1645 and later occupied Tabor Court from 1719 until 1934 when the school moved to Berkshire. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip\"&gt;Prince Philip&lt;/a&gt; attended the school in Cheam in the years immediately preceding its move.\nCheam Charter Fair.\nEvery year on 15 May the Cheam Charter Fair is held. It is thought to date back to 1259 when Henry III granted Cheam a charter, making it a town. Firm historical records of Cheam Charter Fair date back to the 1800s when a fairground accompanied the market.\nCheam Village and North Cheam.\nCheam Village is centred on the crossroads between Sutton, North Cheam, South Cheam and Ewell.\nIt has a &lt;a href=\"conservation%20area\"&gt;conservation area&lt;/a&gt; and a number of historic buildings dating back several centuries, including Nonsuch Mansion, the gabled Whitehall and Lumley Chapel, and a Georgian former rectory.\nCheam Village is a part of Cheam. Cheam Village Conservation Area was designated in 1970 \u2013 it covers historic parkland, housing of varying styles and age and a mock Tudor shopping area with timber detailing and leaded-lights. The entrances to Cheam Park and &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Park\"&gt;Nonsuch Park&lt;/a&gt; with its historic mansion are approximately two hundred yards from the village centre crossroads.\nNorth Cheam is centred north, at the crossroads between Cheam Village and Worcester Park, Epsom and Morden. Victoria Junction is the centre of North Cheam. The area consists of a large Sainsbury's supermarket with adjoining Starbucks, a neighbouring park, a number of independent shops and restaurants, a post office and a Costa. There are plans to redevelop the site of a vacant 1960s building at the North Cheam crossroad and expand commercial and residential buildings. St. Anthony's Hospital is a large private hospital in North Cheam.\nCheam Leisure Centre, on Malden Road, has facilities including a swimming pool (30m x 12m), squash courts and fitness gym.\nThe population of Cheam, consisting of the Cheam and Nonsuch wards, was 20,972 in 2011.\nPlaces of note.\nWhitehall.\nWhitehall is a &lt;a href=\"timber%20framing\"&gt;timber framed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weatherboard\"&gt;weatherboard&lt;/a&gt;ed house in the centre of Cheam Village. It was originally built in about 1500 as a &lt;a href=\"wattle%20and%20daub\"&gt;wattle and daub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeoman\"&gt;yeoman&lt;/a&gt; farmer's house but has been much extended. The external weatherboard dates from the 18th century. In the garden there is a medieval &lt;a href=\"Water%20well\"&gt;well&lt;/a&gt; which served an earlier building on the site.\nNow an &lt;a href=\"historic%20house%20museum\"&gt;historic house museum&lt;/a&gt;, the building features a period kitchen, and house details from the &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20era\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edwardian\"&gt;Edwardian&lt;/a&gt; eras. The museum temporarily closed in 2016 to allow for a \u00a31.6m refurbishment of the building. It reopened in June 2018 with improved facilities.\nCheam War Memorial.\nClose to Cheam Library and the much-rebuilt Church, the memorial is to the people of Cheam who lost their lives during World War I, World War II and the &lt;a href=\"Falklands%20War\"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a number of inscriptions on the structure, including one at the 12 O'Clock Face which reads: \nIt was designated a Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016.\nThe Old Rectory.\nThe Old Rectory is a large part timber-framed house, built in the Tudor period, but extended and remodelled in the 18th century. It is occasionally open to the public.\nThe Old Cottage.\nThe Old Cottage was built in the late 15th or early 16th century. Initially built as a cottage, it became a small &lt;a href=\"brewery\"&gt;brewery&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century. It originally stood in the Broadway (then Malden Road) near the junction with Ewell Road. Under threat of demolition when the road was widened in 1922, it was saved by the local council, working with a local architect and historian.\nThe building was dismantled by removing the original wooden pins from the timber frame. The parts were then moved to the present site one hundred yards down the road and reassembled. The Old Cottage features a local historical plaque, and is now used as a bridalwear shop.\nThe Old Farmhouse.\nA large timber-framed and weatherboarded &lt;a href=\"yeoman\"&gt;yeoman&lt;/a&gt; farmer's house, forming part of the Cheam Conservation Area with St Dunstan's Church, Whitehall, The Old Rectory and the Lumley Chapel, the Old Farmhouse has a crown post roof and large Tudor axial chimney stack in the centre with large fireplaces. The earliest part of the house is 15th century, with several building stages extending the house in the 16th and 17th centuries, creating a Baffle House design popular in the 17th century.\nMany original features remain including oak doors and hinges, &lt;a href=\"window%20shutter\"&gt;window shutter&lt;/a&gt;s and fireplaces. Much of the timber framing is exposed throughout the house. Recent excavation and ground imaging uncovered a large Tudor kitchen underneath the house with a Tudor hearth and hood visible. Access to the cellar kitchen was by a staircase going north to south, which is now under the floor of the current kitchen. A file of text and images relating to the house is available in the Conservation Archive in Sutton Library.\nNonsuch Mansion.\nNonsuch Mansion is a Grade II listed &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20revival\"&gt;Gothic revival&lt;/a&gt; mansion within Nonsuch Park. The Service Wing Museum is open to the public during the summer on Sundays. It is run by the Friends of Nonsuch, which charitable organisation also commissioned the largest model of Nonsuch Palace available. The model was created by designer Ben Taggart and can be seen throughout the year on Sundays. The mansion itself is a popular place for wedding receptions, as is available for hire. In &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; times the land upon which Nonsuch Mansion sits was part of the three thousand &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"manorialism\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cuddington%2C%20Surrey\"&gt;Cuddington&lt;/a&gt;. The mansion was originally built in 1731\u20131743 by Joseph Thompson and later bought by Samuel Farmer in 1799. He employed &lt;a href=\"Jeffry%20Wyattville\"&gt;Jeffry Wyattville&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild it in a Tudor Gothic style in 1802\u20131806. Farmer was succeeded by his grandson in 1838 under whom the gardens became famous.\nNonsuch Mansion bears a resemblance in its design to the original design of &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Palace\"&gt;Nonsuch Palace&lt;/a&gt;, whose construction was begun by King Henry VIII in the 16th century. Built within the north porch of the mansion is a block from the original Nonsuch Palace that bears an inscription which means \"1543 Henry VIII in the 35th year of His reign.\"\nPlaces of worship.\nSt Dunstan's Church is the area's &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt;, situated in Cheam Village, next to Lumley Chapel. St Paul's Howell Hill is on Northey Avenue at the far west of the town, although it is actually in the borough of Epsom and Ewell. It is known locally due to its prominent presence on a roundabout and its contemporary design. At the eastern end of Northey Avenue is St Andrews United Reformed Church. Cheam Baptist Church is located next to St Dunstan's Church. Cheam Methodist Church is in the east of the town just off the A217 and is also home to Sutton Schoolswork, the local Christian schools charity working in the borough of Sutton.\nSt Dunstan's Church.\nThe parish church of &lt;a href=\"Dunstan\"&gt;St. Dunstan&lt;/a&gt; is Grade II* listed. It was built in Cheam Village in 1864 next to &lt;a href=\"Lumley%20Chapel\"&gt;Lumley Chapel&lt;/a&gt; on the site of a medieval church. It was built with &lt;a href=\"Kentish%20ragstone\"&gt;Kentish ragstone&lt;/a&gt; below pitched slate roofs, with dressings to windows and doors in &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Stone\"&gt;Bath Stone&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed by &lt;a href=\"F.%20H.%20Pownall\"&gt;F. H. Pownall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20revival\"&gt;Gothic revival&lt;/a&gt; architectural style, and features &lt;a href=\"polychrome%20brickwork\"&gt;polychrome brickwork&lt;/a&gt; decoration internally. The &lt;a href=\"lychgate\"&gt;lychgate&lt;/a&gt;, dated 1891, at the entrance to the churchyard, is listed Grade\u00a0II. In the churchyard are three tombs which are Grade\u00a0II listed.\nThe graveyard attached to this church was twice subject to a archaeological excavation by the police, first between June and September 2012, and again from April 2013. This excavation was conducted in order to uncover evidence in the investigation into the unsolved &lt;a href=\"disappearance%20of%20Lee%20Boxell\"&gt;disappearance of Lee Boxell&lt;/a&gt;, a fifteen-year-old local schoolboy, in 1988. The church was home to an informal youth club in the 1980s, known as 'The Shed'.\nLumley Chapel.\nSituated next to St Dunstan's Church, &lt;a href=\"Lumley%20Chapel\"&gt;Lumley Chapel&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest standing building in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Sutton\"&gt;London Borough of Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, and contains many notable monuments to local families.\nFollowing the construction of the new St Dunstan's church in 1864, the older church on the site was demolished, other than the east end of the chancel, which was retained to contain the monuments and &lt;a href=\"monumental%20brasses\"&gt;brasses&lt;/a&gt; from the old church. This remnant of the former church is now known as the Lumley Chapel. It is constructed in partly &lt;a href=\"roughcast\"&gt;roughcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rubble\"&gt;rubble&lt;/a&gt; stone and brick, and has a gabled tile roof. The east window dates from the 15th\u00a0century and has three lights. In the south wall is the blocked &lt;a href=\"arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; that formerly led into the south chapel.\nThe remnant was declared &lt;a href=\"Redundant%20church\"&gt;\"redundant\"&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, and &lt;a href=\"vesting\"&gt;vested&lt;/a&gt; in the Churches Conservation Trust. It has been designated by &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; as a Grade\u00a0II* &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;, and is under the care of a national charity, the &lt;a href=\"Churches%20Conservation%20Trust\"&gt;Churches Conservation Trust&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemography.\n38.2% of homes in Cheam are detached houses, 23% are semi-detached, 20.6% are flats/maisonettes/apartments, and 18.6% are terraced.\nParks and gardens.\nCheam is mainly built up, but retains Cheam Park and Nonsuch Park, the latter home to a historic building, &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20Mansion\"&gt;Nonsuch Mansion&lt;/a&gt; and extensive flower gardens.\nCheam Park backs onto Nonsuch Park, with tennis courts, football pitches and a children's playground.\nSchools.\nThere are a number of schools in Cheam, including &lt;a href=\"Nonsuch%20High%20School\"&gt;Nonsuch High School&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt; for girls and &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20High%20School\"&gt;Cheam High School&lt;/a&gt;, a large mixed comprehensive school on Chatsworth Road.\nPrimary schools include Cuddington Croft, St Cecilias Catholic Primary School, Cheam Fields Primary, Cheam Common Primary, Cheam Park Farm Nursery and Infants School, Cheam Park Farm Juniors, Nonsuch Primary and St. Dunstans Church of England Primary.\nTransport.\nCheam is served by &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20railway%20station\"&gt;Cheam station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Sutton%20and%20Mole%20Valley%20lines\"&gt;Sutton and Mole Valley lines&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Sutton%20railway%20station%20%28London%29\"&gt;Sutton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Epsom%20railway%20station\"&gt;Epsom&lt;/a&gt;. It is in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20stations%20in%20London%20fare%20zone%205\"&gt;Travelcard Zone 5&lt;/a&gt;. Services from Cheam to central London include direct trains to Victoria which take about 30 minutes.\nIn 1910, parliamentary approval was given to the &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20and%20Sutton%20Railway\"&gt;Wimbledon and Sutton Railway&lt;/a&gt; to construct a &lt;a href=\"Cheam%20tube%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; at Cheam Road, Sutton that would have been served by the &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"District%20Railway\"&gt;District Railway&lt;/a&gt;. Following negotiations between the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London\"&gt;Underground Electric Railways Company of London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the line was eventually opened in 1930 by the Southern Railway, though the station was replaced by &lt;a href=\"West%20Sutton%20railway%20station\"&gt;West Sutton&lt;/a&gt; to its north.\nIn 1946, a report on London's railways to the Ministry of War Transport detailed possible new routes and rail lines for the London Underground, including the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20line\"&gt;Victoria line&lt;/a&gt; and a route that would serve similar stations to &lt;a href=\"Crossrail\"&gt;Crossrail&lt;/a&gt;. The same report recommended extending the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20line\"&gt;Northern line&lt;/a&gt; to North Cheam, contingent on doubling the tracks between &lt;a href=\"Kennington%20tube%20station\"&gt;Kennington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tooting%20Broadway%20tube%20station\"&gt;Tooting Broadway&lt;/a&gt; such that &lt;a href=\"Charing%20Cross%20tube%20station\"&gt;Charing Cross&lt;/a&gt; trains would terminate at Tooting Broadway, and with an intermediate station at &lt;a href=\"Morden%20South%20railway%20station\"&gt;Morden South&lt;/a&gt;. Both proposals would each have cost \u00a31,500,000. The proposed site for North Cheam station would have occupied the site of what was then a &lt;a href=\"Granada%20plc\"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt; cinema on London Road in &lt;a href=\"North%20Cheam\"&gt;North Cheam&lt;/a&gt;, which was opened in 1937 and closed in 1969; one half was demolished to make way for a community centre car park, and the other half of which is now a &lt;a href=\"Wetherspoon\"&gt;Wetherspoon&lt;/a&gt; pub. However, as no detailed planning and application was made for permission to construct the extension \u2014 by the report's own admission, \"the period required for construction, under the most favourable conditions, would not be less than 30 years\" \u2014 the extension to North Cheam did not take place.\nCheam and North Cheam are served by bus routes including services 213 (Sutton to Kingston), 151 (Wallington to Worcester Park), 93 (North Cheam to Putney Bridge) and the less frequent X26 express service between Heathrow Airport and Croydon.\nCultural references.\nIn the comedy show \"&lt;a href=\"Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour\"&gt;Hancock's Half Hour&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Hancock\"&gt;Tony Hancock&lt;/a&gt; lived in the fictional road Railway Cuttings, in East Cheam. Though not in existence today, the census of 1841 includes the place-names East Cheam, North Cheam, Garden Green and Cheam Common, which indicates that East Cheam did exist officially in name and was not fictional.\nCheam is referred to in a rhyme dating back to the 18th century, and revised in the Victorian era to:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Sutton%2C%20London\"&gt;Sutton&lt;/a&gt; for good mutton;\nCheam for juicy beef;\n&lt;a href=\"Croydon\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt; for a pretty girl\nAnd &lt;a href=\"Mitcham\"&gt;Mitcham&lt;/a&gt; for a thief.\"\nDisappearance of Lee Boxell.\n&lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20Lee%20Boxell\"&gt;Lee Boxell&lt;/a&gt;, a 15-year-old schoolboy, disappeared near his home in Cheam on 10 September 1988. He was last seen outside of the then-&lt;a href=\"Tesco\"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; supermarket (now an &lt;a href=\"Asda\"&gt;ASDA&lt;/a&gt; store) at 2:20pm. The case remains unsolved. It was featured in the national press and on &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; TV's \"&lt;a href=\"Crimewatch\"&gt;Crimewatch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFilm locations.\nSt. Dunstan's Church was used in an episode of the TV comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20I.T.%20Crowd\"&gt;The I.T. Crowd&lt;/a&gt;\", Series 2 (\"Return of the Golden Child\").\nScenes from an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Made%20in%20Chelsea\"&gt;Made in Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;\" were filmed in Nonsuch Mansion."
