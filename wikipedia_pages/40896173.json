    "text": "Federal Hill is a historic home located at &lt;a href=\"Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fredericksburg, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. It was built about 1794, and is a -story, brick and frame dwelling sheathed in weatherboard, with a two-story frame wing. It has a gable roof with dormers. The front facade has a central pedimented pavilion and recessed fanlight door. The large ballroom and elaborate dining room are distinctive for their mixing of late colonial and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20architecture\"&gt;Federal&lt;/a&gt; detailing. Federal Hill was probably built by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Brooke%20%28Virginia%20governor%29\"&gt;Robert Brooke&lt;/a&gt; (1761\u20131800), governor of Virginia from 1794 to 1796.\nIt was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1975."
