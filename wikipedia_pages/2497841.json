    "text": "Mythimna pallens, the common wainscot, is a &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; of the family &lt;a href=\"Noctuidae\"&gt;Noctuidae&lt;/a&gt; distributed throughout the &lt;a href=\"Palearctic%20realm\"&gt;Palearctic realm&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in the west, through Europe (all of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amur%20river\"&gt;Amur&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Kuriles\"&gt;Kuriles&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The species was &lt;a href=\"Species%20description\"&gt;first described&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; in his 1758 &lt;a href=\"10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae\"&gt;10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with other \"wainscots\", this species has buffish-yellow forewings with prominent venation. The common wainscot, as the specific name suggests, is very pale, lacking the darker markings shown by most of its relatives. The hindwings are pure white.\nTechnical description and variation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wingspan\"&gt;wingspan&lt;/a&gt; is 32\u201340\u00a0mm. Forewing yellowish ochreous, often with a rufous tinge; veins pale, defined by grey-brown streaks, and with similar streaks in the intervals; dark spots on veins 2 and 5 beyond middle; hindwing white, grey at centre, the veins dark; \u2014 ab. \"ectypa\" Hbn. is the form in which the red tints are strongest; in \"arcuata\" Stph. the hindwing shows a complete row of dark dots on the veins.\nSimilar species.\n\"Mythimna impura\" is difficult to certainly distinguish from its congeners. See Townsend et al.\nBiology.\nOne or two broods are produced each year with adults on the wing at any time from June to October. The moth flies at night and is attracted to light, sugar and various &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"larva\"&gt;larva&lt;/a&gt; is yellowish or reddish with grey irroration (sprinkling); dorsal line white, with dark edges; spiracles black, lying in a yellowish white lateral stripe, which is edged with blackish. It feeds on various &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;es including \"&lt;a href=\"Deschampsia\"&gt;Deschampsia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"fescue\"&gt;Festuca&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Leymus\"&gt;Leymus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"ryegrass\"&gt;Lolium&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Phalaris%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Phalaris&lt;/a&gt;\". The species overwinters as a small larva."
