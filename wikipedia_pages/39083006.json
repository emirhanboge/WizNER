    "text": "Brisworthy stone circle () is a &lt;a href=\"stone%20circle\"&gt;stone circle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Dartmoor\"&gt;Dartmoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt;. It is located three miles east of the A386, northeast of the village of &lt;a href=\"Shaugh%20Prior\"&gt;Shaugh Prior&lt;/a&gt;. It is three hundred metres from &lt;a href=\"Ringmoor%20stone%20row%20and%20cairn%20circle\"&gt;Ringmoor stone row and cairn circle&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of the archaeological sites found in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Plym%20Valley\"&gt;Upper Plym Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe stone circle is a slight oval shape with a diameter of around 24 metres. It consists of 24 upright stones which are probably only half the original number. The stones are broad rather than tall, and are less than 1 metre tall.\nPrior to 1909 most of the stones had fallen. It was restored in that year, and a trial excavation is said to have yielded a small amount of charcoal and one rough flint flake."
