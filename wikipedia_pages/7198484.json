    "text": "Internal security is the act of keeping peace within the &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt;s of a &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Self-governance\"&gt;self-governing territories&lt;/a&gt;, generally by upholding the national &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; and defending against internal security threats. Responsibility for internal security may range from &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; forces, and in exceptional circumstances, the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nThreats to internal security.\nThreats to the general peace may range from low-level &lt;a href=\"civil%20order\"&gt;civil order&lt;/a&gt;, large scale &lt;a href=\"violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, or even an armed &lt;a href=\"insurgency\"&gt;insurgency&lt;/a&gt;. Threats to internal security may be directed at either the state's &lt;a href=\"citizen\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt;s, or the organs and infrastructure of &lt;a href=\"State%20%28polity%29\"&gt;the state&lt;/a&gt; itself, and may range from petty &lt;a href=\"crime\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;, serious &lt;a href=\"organised%20crime\"&gt;organized crime&lt;/a&gt;, political or industrial unrest, or even domestic &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. Foreign powers may also act as a threat to internal security, by either committing or sponsoring terrorism or &lt;a href=\"rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, without actually &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20war\"&gt;declaring war&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernmental responsibility for internal security will generally rest with an &lt;a href=\"interior%20ministry\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to a &lt;a href=\"Defence%20minister\"&gt;defence ministry&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the state, a state's internal security will be maintained by either the ordinary &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; or more militarised security forces (known as &lt;a href=\"Gendarmerie\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; or, literally, the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Troops\"&gt;Internal Troops&lt;/a&gt;.). Other specialized internal security agencies may exist to augment these main forces, such as &lt;a href=\"border%20guard\"&gt;border guard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20special%20law%20enforcement%20units\"&gt;special police unit&lt;/a&gt;s, or aspects of the state's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20agency\"&gt;intelligence agencies&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, internal security may be the primary responsibility of a &lt;a href=\"secret%20police\"&gt;secret police&lt;/a&gt; force.\nThe level of authorized force used by agencies and forces responsible for maintaining internal security might range from unarmed &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; to fully armed &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; organizations, or employ some level of &lt;a href=\"less-lethal%20weapon\"&gt;less-lethal weapon&lt;/a&gt;ry in between. For violent situations, internal security forces may contain some element of military type equipment such as &lt;a href=\"non-military%20armored%20vehicles\"&gt;non-military armored vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nJustice aspects.\nDepending on the organization of the state, internal security forces may have &lt;a href=\"jurisdiction\"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; on national or &lt;a href=\"Federation\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; levels. As the concept of internal security refers to the entity of the state and its citizens, persons who are threats to internal security may be designated as an &lt;a href=\"enemy%20of%20the%20state\"&gt;enemy of the state&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"enemy%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemy of the people&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersons detained by internal security forces may either be dealt with by the normal &lt;a href=\"criminal%20justice\"&gt;criminal justice&lt;/a&gt; system, or for more serious crimes against internal security such as &lt;a href=\"treason\"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt;, they may face special measures such as &lt;a href=\"secret%20trial\"&gt;secret trial&lt;/a&gt;s. In times of extreme unrest, internal security actions may include measures such as &lt;a href=\"internment\"&gt;internment&lt;/a&gt; (detention without trial).\nRelationship with the military.\nDepending on the nature of the specific state's &lt;a href=\"form%20of%20government\"&gt;form of government&lt;/a&gt;, enforcing internal security will generally not be carried out by a country's &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; forces, whose primary role is external defense, except in times of extreme unrest or other &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20emergency\"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;, short of &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. Often, military involvement in internal security is explicitly prohibited, or is restricted to authorized &lt;a href=\"military%20aid%20to%20the%20civil%20power\"&gt;military aid to the civil power&lt;/a&gt; as part of the principle of &lt;a href=\"civilian%20control%20of%20the%20military\"&gt;civilian control of the military&lt;/a&gt;. Military &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20special%20forces%20units\"&gt;special forces units&lt;/a&gt; may in some cases be put under the temporary command of civilian powers, for special internal security situations such as &lt;a href=\"counter%20terrorism\"&gt;counter terrorism&lt;/a&gt; operations."
