    "text": "Burnum Burnum (10 January 1936 \u2013 17 August 1997) was an &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australian\"&gt;Aboriginal Australian&lt;/a&gt; sportsman, activist, actor, and author. He was a &lt;a href=\"Woiworrung\"&gt;Woiworrung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorta%20Yorta%20people\"&gt;Yorta Yorta&lt;/a&gt; man at &lt;a href=\"Wallaga%20Lake\"&gt;Wallaga Lake&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. He was originally christened Harry Penrith but took the name of his great grandfather, which means \"Great Warrior\".\nEarly life.\nBurnam Burnam was one of the stolen generations, taken from his parents when he was barely three months old. Featured on Late Night Live with Phillip Adams in 1999, the story of his early years graphically illustrates the brutality of the assimilation policy in the second part of the twentieth century&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/burnam-burnam/3560634\"&gt;radionational/programs/latenightlive/burnam-burnam&lt;/a&gt;. Burnam was raised as an orphan and as a white person. He was called Harry Penrith, and was taught that white was good and black bad. Burnam spent many years in children's homes run by the &lt;a href=\"Aborigines%20Welfare%20Board\"&gt;NSW Aborigines Welfare Board&lt;/a&gt;, most notably Kinchela Boys Home at &lt;a href=\"Kempsey%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Kempsey&lt;/a&gt;. The Welfare Board promoted his achievements in &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"surf%20lifesaving\"&gt;surf lifesaving&lt;/a&gt; at Kempsey in their publication &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Dawn\"&lt;/a&gt; magazine, and reported that he left Kinchela to become a pioneer Aboriginal employee in the NSW Public Service, working for the Department of Agriculture, where he remained for 13 years. But stolen generation's people like Burnam, though raised 'white' were rejected by white society, leaving them with nothing. In the 1960s he searched for his Aboriginal identity and joined the battle for Aboriginal rights. \nSportsman.\nBurnum Burnum also played &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Union\"&gt;first grade Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Parramatta, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and both &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivism.\nBurnum Burnum became involved in &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20land%20rights%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Australian Indigenous rights activism&lt;/a&gt; while attending the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tasmania\"&gt;University of Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s, he led a successful movement to reclaim the remains of &lt;a href=\"Truganini\"&gt;Truganini&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tasmanian%20Museum\"&gt;Tasmanian Museum&lt;/a&gt; for cremation. He was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20Fellowship\"&gt;Churchill Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in 1975 to study other Indigenous people.\nHe may be best remembered for planting the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20flag\"&gt;Aboriginal flag&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"white%20cliffs%20of%20Dover\"&gt;white cliffs of Dover&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Bicentenary\"&gt;Australian Bicentenary&lt;/a&gt; Day of 26 January 1988. This was his satirical way of claiming England, as &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Phillip\"&gt;Arthur Phillip&lt;/a&gt; had done to Burnum Burnum's homeland in 1788 when arriving with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Fleet\"&gt;First Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. A copy of the \"Burnum Burnum Declaration\" is on display among the Indigenous carvings and sculptures at the Enchanted Maze (a.k.a. Arthur's Seat Maze), &lt;a href=\"Mornington%20Peninsula\"&gt;Mornington Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nActing.\nIn 1986, Burnum Burnum played roles in three films. The first was \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Age%20%28film%29\"&gt;Dark Age&lt;/a&gt;\", a thriller set in outback and tropical Australia, and which also starred &lt;a href=\"David%20Gulpillil\"&gt;David Gulpillil&lt;/a&gt; as Burnum's son. The second was \"&lt;a href=\"Ground%20Zero%20%281987%20film%29\"&gt;Ground Zero&lt;/a&gt;\", a thriller containing themes critical of the British and Australian governments' treatment of &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga\"&gt;nuclear weapon testing at Maralinga&lt;/a&gt;. The third was a satirical film, \"\", in which Burnum's character becomes a &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Tasmanian%20tiger\"&gt;Tasmanian tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurnum appeared as Uncle Albert in the 1992 TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Boney%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Boney&lt;/a&gt;\" about an Aboriginal detective.\nPolitics.\nBurnum stood for election to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Senate\"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt;, as an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20politicians%20in%20Australia\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales in the &lt;a href=\"Results%20of%20the%201983%20Australian%20federal%20election%20%28Senate%29\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Results%20of%20the%201984%20Australian%20federal%20election%20%28Senate%29\"&gt;1984 Federal elections&lt;/a&gt;. He was also an &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Democrats\"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;' candidate for the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;New South Wales Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1988%20North%20Shore%20state%20by-election\"&gt;1988 North Shore state by-election&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"John%20Howard\"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; described Burnum Burnum as \"a very gracious man and very strongly committed to the welfare of Aboriginal Australians\".\nDeath.\nIn his later life Burnum Burnum lived in &lt;a href=\"Woronora\"&gt;Woronora&lt;/a&gt; a suburb in the &lt;a href=\"Sutherland%20Shire\"&gt;Sutherland Shire&lt;/a&gt;, where he was active in the local community. He died from heart disease on 17 August 1997, aged 61. A portrait of Burnum Burnum now hangs in &lt;a href=\"Sutherland%20Library\"&gt;Sutherland Library&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005 &lt;a href=\"Jannali%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Jannali&lt;/a&gt; Reserve was renamed &lt;a href=\"Burnum%20Burnum%20Reserve\"&gt;Burnum Burnum Reserve&lt;/a&gt; in his honour."
