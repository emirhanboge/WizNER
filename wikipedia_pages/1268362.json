    "text": "The Bangladesh national football team () is the national recognised football team of &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Bangladesh Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (BFF). It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt;, and became a member of FIFA in 1974. Even though the Bangladesh Football Federation was first founded in 1972. Bangladesh was elected as a member of the AFC Executive Committee in 1982\u20131986 and 1998\u20132002. The current Executive Committee was elected democratically, under an AFC approved constitution and direct supervision of &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt;, in April 2008.\nBangladesh's national team debuted in 1973 and has yet to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals. They were dismissed in the first round of their only &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; appearance to date in &lt;a href=\"1980%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;; by qualifying for it, Bangladesh is one of the only two South Asian nations to achieve the feat. The nation's best results came at &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;n level where it won the &lt;a href=\"SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;SAFF Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, under the coaching of &lt;a href=\"Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Kott%C3%A1n\"&gt;Gy\u00f6rgy Kott\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and were gold medalists in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;South Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; once as a national team. Bangladesh was one of &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;southern Asia&lt;/a&gt;'s leading team in the 2000s. However, as is the case elsewhere on the subcontinent, top-level &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh is played somewhere in the shadow of the country's &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;national cricket team&lt;/a&gt;. This is mostly due to inadequate budget allocation and lack of technical skills adaptation. To date, football remains a popular sport in Bangladesh but cricket remains the most popular sport in the nation.\nHistory.\nOrigins (1933\u20131971).\nDuring the early 1930s there were many tournaments being held in East Bengal and, it was seen that the Bengalis their were getting a little better at football. So in 1933, Dhaka Sporting Association, known as the DSA, was formed in a small tin house at Paltan Maidan in &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the three largest clubs in Dhaka at that time, &lt;a href=\"Wari%20Club%20Dhaka\"&gt;Wari Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20SC\"&gt;Victoria SC&lt;/a&gt; and Lakshibazar Club, were already playing daily matches, at the &lt;a href=\"Paltan%20Maidan\"&gt;Paltan Maidan&lt;/a&gt;. The clubs divided the field into three parts and the DSA introduced inter-school and inter-college tournaments after its inception and the current &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Post%20Office\"&gt;GPO&lt;/a&gt; post office in &lt;a href=\"Gulistan%2C%20Dhaka\"&gt;Gulistan&lt;/a&gt; was then the designated ground for the tournament.\nIn those days, &lt;a href=\"Islington%20Corinthians%20F.C.\"&gt;Islington Corinthians&lt;/a&gt; from England toured all around the world, and introduced their football to every country they visited. On November 10, the team visited &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, where they took on the DSA XI. The Bengalis of Dhaka handed Corinthians their first ever loss, when the DSA XI defeated Corinthians 1-0 during their encounter. Most of the players were students of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka University&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of people were overjoyed to see the English lose on the field that day. While leaving, the English side admitted to their defeat, saying, \u201cI heard a lot about the Bengal tiger! This time I saw it!\u201d\nThe football rivalry between &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; started under DSA. Notable clubs which participated in the historical &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20League\"&gt;Dhaka Football League&lt;/a&gt; from 1933 till the partition of the country were &lt;a href=\"Wari%20Club%20Dhaka\"&gt;Wari Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20SC\"&gt;Victoria SC&lt;/a&gt;, Lakshibazar Club, East End Club, Central Jail XI, &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20Wanderers%20Club\"&gt;Dhaka Wanderers Club&lt;/a&gt; and Tejgaon Friends Union. The late 1950s and 1960s saw, Bengali football starting to earn more popularity among the people, when the clubs took part in the &lt;a href=\"Aga%20Khan%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;Aga Khan Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which was held &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; every year. Clubs from all over Asia were invited to compete in the tournament, resulting in massive crowds being drawn into the stadiums, to witness their local clubs take on foreign teams.\nThe first instance of a Bangladesh national football team was the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Shadhin%20Bangla%20Football%20Team\"&gt;Shadhin Bangla Football Team&lt;/a&gt; during the 1971 &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War\"&gt;liberation war&lt;/a&gt;. They toured throughout &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; to raise international awareness and economic support for the liberation war, the team played 16 exhibition matches in different states and cities of India and helped fund the Bangladesh government by handing over all the prize money they earned during their tour.\nEmergence (1972\u20131980).\nFollowing the nations independence from &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of 1971, the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Bangladesh Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;, was founded on 15 July 1972, by &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Yusuf%20Ali\"&gt;Md. Yousuf Ali&lt;/a&gt;, the country's former Minister for Education and Cultural Affairs. The &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;BFF&lt;/a&gt; became affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; in 1973, and &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. \nOn 26 July 1973, the Bangladesh football team played its first official game, a 2\u20132 draw against &lt;a href=\"Thailand%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. During the period between 27 July 1973 and 14 August 1975, the national team played a total of 15 friendly matches, all of them were against &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; teams, 14 of the games were hosted in &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in 3 draws, 10 defeats and 1 victory. On 13 August 1973, during the only friendly match which was not held &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, the Bangladesh team earned their first ever win, by defeating hosts &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130. A year later, on 18 December 1976, the team played a friendly against a strong &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; side, and ended up being trashed 6\u20130.\nThe next official matches came during the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201978%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1978 Asian games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh once again faced &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and also had their first encounter against &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, both games ended in a defeat. In January 1979, the &lt;a href=\"1980%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1980%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1980 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; began and surprisingly considering their previous record, Bangladesh opened their campaign with draws against &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;. A harsh 4\u20130 defeat against Qatar followed, in spite of that, an astonishing 4\u20131 victory over the Afghans, which was only the team's second ever victory, saw them qualify for the main tournament, at their first attempt.\nIn preparation for the Asian Cup, Bangladesh played four more friendly matches, losing three of them and suffering their heaviest ever defeat, when they lost 9\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, the team managed to win one of their games, which came in a 3\u20131 trashing of &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.\n1980 AFC Asian Cup Group A.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1980%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1980 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in September 1980 in &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, and Bangladesh were grouped with defending champions &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"China%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The team opened the tournament respectably with a narrow 3\u20132 defeat against North Korea. Their goals came from &lt;a href=\"Kazi%20Salahuddin\"&gt;Kazi Salahuddin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashraf%20Uddin%20Ahmed%20Chunnu\"&gt;Ashraf Chunnu&lt;/a&gt;. They also held on well against &lt;a href=\"Syria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, only to lose by one goal. However, the next couple of gams saw Bangladesh being embarrassed 7\u20130 and 6\u20130 respectively by Iran and China, finishing the tournament bottom of their table with a total of 17 goals being conceded.\nRise and Fall (1980\u20132002).\nThe early 80s and 90s saw Bangladesh consistently producing great talents, with most of the star players emerging from &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20League\"&gt;Dhaka League&lt;/a&gt; giants &lt;a href=\"Mohammedan%20SC%20%28Dhaka%29\"&gt;Mohammedan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abahani%20Limited%20Dhaka\"&gt;Abahani Limited Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20Union\"&gt;Brothers Union&lt;/a&gt;. The league was highly competitive, drawing thousands of fans into the &lt;a href=\"Bangabandhu%20National%20Stadium\"&gt;Bangabandhu National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and the clubs were even doing well in the &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Champions%20League\"&gt;AFC Champions League&lt;/a&gt;. During the early 80s the &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20Derby\"&gt;Dhaka Derby&lt;/a&gt; which always had masses of spectators visit the capital from all over the country, produced some of the greatest players in the countries footballing history, with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Monem%20Munna\"&gt;Monem Munna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rumman%20Bin%20Wali%20Sabbir\"&gt;Rumman Sabbir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaiser%20Hamid\"&gt;Kaiser Hamid&lt;/a&gt;, to name only a few, that stole the hearts of Bangladeshi football fans with their amazing performances on the field.\nIn 1985, the team took part in the &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20AFC%20First%20Round\"&gt;1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers (AFC)&lt;/a&gt;, in their first attempt to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and were grouped along with &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thailand%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Bangladesh got their first ever win in a &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualifier against &lt;a href=\"Indonesia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. The game took place at the &lt;a href=\"Bangabandhu%20National%20Stadium\"&gt;Bangabandhu National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, and even though the team were trailing with 15 minutes left, defender &lt;a href=\"Kaiser%20Hamid\"&gt;Kaiser Hamid&lt;/a&gt; made good use of his height to score with a header and equalize for Bangladesh, and with 5 minutes to go from full time, &lt;a href=\"Ashraf%20Uddin%20Ahmed%20Chunnu\"&gt;Ashraf Chunnu&lt;/a&gt; scored the winner from a free kick just outside the box. The country's second win in the qualifiers came over &lt;a href=\"Thailand%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh also displayed an impressive performance against &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20Stadium\"&gt;Salt Lake Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, during the last matchday of the qualifiers, when they lost 2-1, with two wins from six games, Bangladesh finish bottom of their group. Nonetheless, it was a highly satisfactory debut in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualifiers for the country. During the &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;1990 World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; the team only managed to register a single victory, which came in a 3-1 thrashing of &lt;a href=\"Thailand%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 4 November 1995, under the guidance of coach &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Pfister\"&gt;Otto Pfister&lt;/a&gt; and legendary captain &lt;a href=\"Monem%20Munna\"&gt;Monem Munna&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh won the 4-nation Tiger Trophy held in Myanmar, this was the nations very first major trophy. Bangladesh also won silver during the 1995 &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201995%20South%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;South Asian Games&lt;/a&gt;, losing in the final to hosts &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The year 1996 saw Bangladesh reach their highest &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Rankings\"&gt;FIFA ranking&lt;/a&gt; to date with the team climbing up to 110, after numerous impressive performances. The team's fortunes in regional competitions also improved, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation%20Gold%20Cup%201999\"&gt;1999 SAFF Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;, held in Goa, saw Bangladesh again reach the final and lose to &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, picking up another silver medal, and at &lt;a href=\"1999%20South%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1999 South Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Kathmandu\"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; the team finally took the extra step and won the gold medal.\nOn 12 January 2001, a historic moment occurred for the Bangladesh team, when they played their first match against &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; country, a &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Super%20Soccer%20Cup\"&gt;Sahara Cup&lt;/a&gt; encounter against &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, who won the game 2\u20130. On 18 March 2001, &lt;a href=\"Firoz%20Mahmud%20Titu%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Firoz Mahmud Titu&lt;/a&gt; became the first Bangladeshi player to score against European opposition, when Bangladesh suffered a 4-1 defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, in the same competition. Bangladesh yet again failed to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, as the team got knocked out from the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20AFC%20First%20Round\"&gt;2002 World Cup qualifiers First Round&lt;/a&gt;, with only 1 win from 4 games.\n(2003) SAFF Gold Cup triumph.\nThe &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation%20Gold%20Cup%202003\"&gt;South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup 2003&lt;/a&gt;, which took place between 10 January 2003 and 20 January 2003, saw Bangladesh under &lt;a href=\"Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Kott%C3%A1n\"&gt;Gy\u00f6rgy Kott\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, win their first major tournament in eight years and this time they did it as the host country. Bangladesh as started off the tournament by winning their opening game against &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; (1-0) with &lt;a href=\"Alfaz%20Ahmed\"&gt;Alfaz Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; scoring the only goal in the 30th minute. In their next game against &lt;a href=\"Maldives%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; they won 1\u20130 by a late winning goal scored by &lt;a href=\"Arif%20Khan%20Joy\"&gt;Arif Khan Joy&lt;/a&gt; in the 90-minute. Bangladesh topped their group by winning their last game against &lt;a href=\"Bhutan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 with &lt;a href=\"Ariful%20Kabir%20Farhad\"&gt;Farhad&lt;/a&gt; scoring two goals and &lt;a href=\"Rokonuzzaman%20Kanchan\"&gt;Kanchan&lt;/a&gt; scoring another one. In the semifinals they faced India, who were the defending champions, after defeating Bangladesh in &lt;a href=\"1999%20South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; SAFF Cup final. Bangladesh avenged their defeat from four years earlier by overcoming India 2\u20131, thanks to an extra time goal by &lt;a href=\"Motiur%20Rahman%20Munna\"&gt;Motiur Rahman Munna&lt;/a&gt; and thus progressing to their second consecutive SAFF Cup final. However, before the finals Bangladesh dealt a huge blow, as their &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rajani%20Kanta%20Barman\"&gt;Rajani Kanta Barman&lt;/a&gt; who played in every game during the tournament until then picked up a suspension which denied him a chance to play in the next match. In the final Bangladesh again faced &lt;a href=\"Maldives%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Al-Mamun\"&gt;Hassan Al-Mamun&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href=\"Rajani%20Kanta%20Barman\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; in defense and took up the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captains&lt;/a&gt; armband before the game. &lt;a href=\"Rokonuzzaman%20Kanchan\"&gt;Rokonuzzaman Kanchan&lt;/a&gt; gave the hosts an early lead in the 13th minute with Bangladesh dominating the first half. During the second half a defensive mistake lead to Bangladesh conceding as &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Umar\"&gt;Ali Umar&lt;/a&gt; equalized in the 57th minute. The game remained tied at 1\u20131 after 90 minutes and even after another 30 minutes of extra time the two sides could not be separated. In the penalty shootout the goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Aminul%20Haque%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Aminul Haque&lt;/a&gt; saved the second penalty from &lt;a href=\"Maldives%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; and at last &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20Sujan\"&gt;Mohammed Sujan&lt;/a&gt; held his nerves and scored the winning penalty and thus Bangladesh won their first and only &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;SAFF&lt;/a&gt; title till date.\nInconsistency (2003\u20132010).\nThe &lt;a href=\"2004%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;2004 AFC Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;, began from March 2003. It was another catastrophic qualifying campaign for Bangladesh, as they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Laos%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt; and tied against &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, which ended the country's &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;AFC Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualification hopes once again. However, the team saw an upturn in form, as they again made it to the final of the &lt;a href=\"SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;SAFF Championship&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"2005%20South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; edition, in &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. They started their campaign defeating Bhutan (3\u20130), &lt;a href=\"Ariful%20Kabir%20Farhad\"&gt;Ariful Kabir Farhad&lt;/a&gt; scored a brace and &lt;a href=\"Zahid%20Hasan%20Ameli\"&gt;Zahid Hasan Ameli&lt;/a&gt; ended the game with his 85th minute goal. A couple of days later the team took on &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; and this time &lt;a href=\"Rokonuzzaman%20Kanchan\"&gt;Rokonuzzaman Kanchan&lt;/a&gt;s brace helped Bangladesh overcome a very defensive &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepali&lt;/a&gt; side. On 12 December 2005, Bangladesh took on tournament favorites &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Football%20Stadium\"&gt;Peoples Football Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, the game ended in a stalemate after &lt;a href=\"Zahid%20Hasan%20Ameli\"&gt;Zahid Hasan Ameli&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal for Bangladesh in the 77th minute. The draw helped Bangladesh reach the semifinals of the tournament as group winners In the semifinals they knocked out the host nation &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20130) thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20Sujan\"&gt;Mohammed Sujan&lt;/a&gt; penalty. In the final they faced &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; just like in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20South%20Asian%20Football%20Federation%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; SAFF Cup final, and once again &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; took home the trophy, defeating Bangladesh 2-0.\nIn December 2005, Bangladesh and &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; played off in a home and away series, to determine which team would progress to the final &lt;a href=\"2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt; round of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Firoz%20Mahmud%20Titu%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Firoz Mahmud Titu&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the series, helping Bangladesh progress to the next round with a 1-0 aggregate scoreline. Nevertheless, the team failed to win a single game during the next round and finished bottom of their qualification group. In 2007 the \n&lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Premier%20League%20%28football%29\"&gt;Bangladesh Premier League&lt;/a&gt; was introduced, replacing the historic &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20League\"&gt;Dhaka League&lt;/a&gt; which had been the countries main league competition even before its independence, this marked the start of a professional football league and the country's first ever wide open national league were teams outside of &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; could participate. The new league was introduced in order to improve the nations footballing standards and to help produce future national stars, as the Bangladesh team were in the midst of bad results. The &lt;a href=\"2008%20SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;2008 SAFF Championship&lt;/a&gt; ended in huge disappointment as Bangladesh failed to win a single game and were knocked out of the tournament during the group-stages.Their underwhelming &lt;a href=\"2008%20SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;SAFF&lt;/a&gt; campaign resulted in the dismissal of coach of Abu Yusuf. He was replaced by former national team player &lt;a href=\"Shafiqul%20Islam%20Manik\"&gt;Shafiqul Islam Manik&lt;/a&gt;, who only lasted at the job for another three months.\nOn 24 January 2009, Bangladesh appointed &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian coach &lt;a href=\"Dido%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Dido&lt;/a&gt;.Under his guidance Bangladesh saw an upturn in results as they won two of their three &lt;a href=\"2010%20AFC%20Challenge%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;2010 AFC Challenge Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt; matches and advanced into the &lt;a href=\"2010%20AFC%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;main tournamnet&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was sacked within 11 months as he refused to select established national team players. During his last interview before leaving Bangladesh, Dido criticized the country's footballing structure and stated that it was corrupt. This again raised questions about &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;BFF&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href=\"Kazi%20Salahuddin\"&gt;Kazi Salahuddin&lt;/a&gt;s management of the country's football. The &lt;a href=\"2009%20SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;2009 SAFF Championship&lt;/a&gt; saw Bangladesh once again hosting the tournament. Former national team keeper Shahidur Rahman Shantoo was appointed as the intern coach just a few days before the tournament. Bangladesh cruised through the group stages with 2 wins and 1 draw, their wins came over &lt;a href=\"Bhutan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sri lanka&lt;/a&gt;.Nonetheless, the team were not able to get through to the final, as they were defeated by a young but energetic &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; team.\nDecline (2011\u2013present).\nOn 29 June 2011 at the &lt;a href=\"Bangabandhu%20National%20Stadium\"&gt;Bangabandhu National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka, Bangladesh beat &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;, the game took place only four days after &lt;a href=\"Nikola%20Ilievski\"&gt;Nikola Ilievski&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the teams head coach. On 3 July 2011, Bangladesh went on to play Pakistan again at &lt;a href=\"Punjab%20Stadium\"&gt;Punjab Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt; where they drew 0\u20130. This allowed Bangladesh to advance to the second round to play against &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.

Since &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; were able to score more goals out of the two games they progressed into the third round eliminating Bangladesh. Bangladesh were not able to reach the semifinals of &lt;a href=\"2011%20SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;2011 SAFF Championship&lt;/a&gt; as they were held to a goalless draw by &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and were defeated by both &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maldives%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; in group stages. \nOn 29 January 2013, &lt;a href=\"Lodewijk%20de%20Kruif\"&gt;Lodewijk de Kruif&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the team, under him Bangladesh failed to qualify into the &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFC%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2014 AFC Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; as they lost to &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; by 0\u20131 despite their wins against the host &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Mariana%20Islands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFC%20Challenge%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt; stage held in March 2013.

These results lead to &lt;a href=\"Lodewijk%20de%20Kruif\"&gt;De Kruif&lt;/a&gt; being sacked, On 8 September 2015. Bangladesh ended their &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;FIFA 2018 World Cup Qualifying&lt;/a&gt; campaign with a disastrous performance, as they suffered a huge 8\u20130 defeat to a &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; team managed by &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Redknapp\"&gt;Harry Redknapp&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Al-Hassan%20Stadium\"&gt;Amman National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March 2016. With seven defeats and a solitary draw against Tajikistan, Bangladesh conceded 32 goals and scored only twice, once apiece against Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. \nOn 29 June 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;BFF&lt;/a&gt; appointed Belgian coach &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Saintfiet\"&gt;Tom Saintfiet&lt;/a&gt;, initially on a short-term contract to guide the national team to the &lt;a href=\"2019%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;AFC Asia Cup 2019 qualification playoff round 2&lt;/a&gt; matches against &lt;a href=\"Bhutan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoach Saintfiet called up the veteran striking pair of &lt;a href=\"Jahid%20Hasan%20Ameli\"&gt;Jahid Hasan Ameli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enamul%20Haque%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Enamul Haque&lt;/a&gt; for the match, but to no avail.

The result in the Asian Cup qualifying play-off meant Bangladesh will not be a part of any &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments for the next couple of years, until the launching of the &lt;a href=\"2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;2022 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2023%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;2023 Asian Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nJamie Day (2018\u20132021).\nOn 17 May 2018, &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Day%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201979%29\"&gt;Jamie Day&lt;/a&gt; was took charge of the team.

Bangladesh managed to earn a well deserved draw against India 1\u20131, where they conceded in the dying minutes of the game. Nonetheless, they lost the remaining matches, but their losses were not as heavy as expected; they even caused hardship to Qatar and Oman. A hard fought draw against &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, saw Bangladesh reach the third Round of &lt;a href=\"2023%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20Third%20Round\"&gt;2023 AFC qualifers&lt;/a&gt;, as the one of the three best fifth-position teams.\nOn September 2021, Bangladesh took part in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Three%20Nations%20Cup%20%28Kyrgyzstan%29\"&gt;2021 Three Nations Cup (Kyrgyzstan)&lt;/a&gt;, the team lost all 3 games, conceding a total of 9 goals and only managing to score 3.

Bangladesh again failed to reach the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20SAFF%20Championship\"&gt;Saff Championship&lt;/a&gt;, this time due to conceding a late penalty against &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, in a game the team had to win to reach the knockout-stages.\nJavier Cabrera (2022\u2013).\nOn 8 January 2022, the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;BFF&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Cabrera\"&gt;Javier Cabrera&lt;/a&gt; as the permanent head coach of Bangladesh, on a 11 month contract.\nTeam image.\nColours.\nThe Bangladesh national football team plays in bottle green shirts and dark red shorts embedded.
