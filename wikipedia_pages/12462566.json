It is one of the 275 \"&lt;a href=\"Paadal%20Petra%20Sthalam\"&gt;Paadal Petra Sthalam&lt;/a&gt;s\" and no &lt;a href=\"Navagraha\"&gt;Navagraha&lt;/a&gt; where the two of the most revered &lt;a href=\"Nayanars\"&gt;Nayanars&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Saivite\"&gt;Saivite&lt;/a&gt; Saints), &lt;a href=\"Appar\"&gt;Appar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Campantar\"&gt;Tirugnana Sambandar&lt;/a&gt; have glorified the temple with their verses during the 7th\u20138th century CE. The temple has been widely expanded by &lt;a href=\"Chola\"&gt;Chola&lt;/a&gt; kings during the 11th century CE. The temple has two seven-tiered gateway towers, a huge tank, with the overall temple area covering 1 acre. The Marundeeswarar temple has been a place of curative worship for people with diseases.\nThe temple has six daily rituals at various times from a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the &lt;a href=\"Chola%20dynasty\"&gt;Chola dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagar rulers. The temple is maintained and administered by the &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20Religious%20and%20Charitable%20Endowments%20Department\"&gt;Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Government of Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;. The latest consecration of the temple after renovation was performed during February 2020. The previous one was in May 2008.\nLegend.\nMarundeeswarar is known so because he imparted sage &lt;a href=\"Agastya\"&gt;Agastya&lt;/a&gt; on curative properties of various herbs and plants. Since then the Marundeeswarar temple has been a place of worship for people with diseases and various problems with their health. It is said that sage &lt;a href=\"Valmiki\"&gt;Valmiki&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote \"&lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt;\", worshiped Shiva in the temple. Since Valmiki was blessed here, the place was to be known as Thiruvalmikiyur, which is pronounced as 'Thiruvanmikiyur' in Tamil, the name gradually changed to Thiruvanmiyur. There is a place present in Thiruvanmiyur called Valmiki Nagar in his honour. There is also a shrine for the sage on the Western side of the temple on what is presently called the East Coast Road (ECR). The &lt;a href=\"lingam\"&gt;lingam&lt;/a&gt; for which &lt;a href=\"Hanuman\"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt; performed &lt;a href=\"Puja%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;pooja&lt;/a&gt;, the lingam (Meenakshi Sundareswarar) that cured the curse of &lt;a href=\"Indra\"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;, the Lingam for which Saint &lt;a href=\"Bharadwaja\"&gt;Bharadwaja&lt;/a&gt; performed pooja are present here. &lt;a href=\"Markandeya\"&gt;Markandeya&lt;/a&gt;r performed a penance and prayed to Shiva here, &lt;a href=\"Brahma\"&gt;Brahma&lt;/a&gt; conducted a festival here for Shiva. The presiding deity is also called Palvannanathar as &lt;a href=\"Kamadhenu\"&gt;Kamadhenu&lt;/a&gt;, the sacred cow, is said to have performed oblation on the Sivalingam with her milk. As per another legend, Sun and Moon perform their worship practices daily during sunset on account of which the main shrine is believed to be facing west.\nHistory.\nThe road starting from Marundeeswarar temple, now called &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Road\"&gt;ECR&lt;/a&gt; was an important route during the &lt;a href=\"Chola\"&gt;Chola&lt;/a&gt; period and was known as Vadagaperuvazhi, connecting the kingdom to places in &lt;a href=\"Thanjavur\"&gt;Thanjavur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;. Inscriptions can be found in the shrine of Tripurasundari Amman dating back to the 11th century during the period of &lt;a href=\"Rajendra%20Chola\"&gt;Rajendra Chola&lt;/a&gt;. The origins and antiquity of this temple is corroborated by the inscriptions found in other temples in the city namely Kapaleeswarar Temple, Virupaksheeswarar Temple and &lt;a href=\"Thiruvidandai\"&gt;Thiruvidandai&lt;/a&gt; which bear testimony to Tiruvanmiyur's existence. A new life has been put into this ancient worshipping place, first in the year 1903 and then in the 1970s. This temple along with the &lt;a href=\"Kapaleeswarar%20Temple\"&gt;Kapaleeswarar Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thyagaraja%20Temple%2C%20Tiruvottiyur\"&gt;Thiruvottiyur Thyagarajaswamy Temple&lt;/a&gt; form the famous Trinity Sea Shore temples of Thondai Mandalam.\nArchitecture.\nThe temple is believed to have partial feature of &lt;a href=\"Pallava%20dynasty\"&gt;Pallava dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and partially with &lt;a href=\"Chola%20art\"&gt;Chola art&lt;/a&gt;.

The \"&lt;a href=\"samadhi\"&gt;samadhi&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Pamban%20Swamigal\"&gt;Pamban Swamigal&lt;/a&gt; is also found near the shrine.\nLiterary mention.\nThe temple is reverred in the verses of \"&lt;a href=\"Tevaram\"&gt;Tevaram&lt;/a&gt;\", the 7th century saivite canonical work by the two saint poets namely, &lt;a href=\"Appar\"&gt;Appar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sambandar\"&gt;Sambandar&lt;/a&gt;. \ntranslating to\nAnother verse explains the devotion towards the goddess of the temple as\ntranslating to\n&lt;a href=\"Arunagirinathar\"&gt;Arunagirinathar&lt;/a&gt; has visited this temple and has sung praises of Subramanya here.\nIn News.\nThe builders of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Road\"&gt;ECR&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Road\"&gt;East Coast Road&lt;/a&gt;) had even considered demolition of the temple of Sage Valmiki lying opposite to the Marundeeswarar temple in order to complete the project (of building the ECR). The high court of Tamil Nadu then directed that the temple be in its place and not to disturb it.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Kumbhabhishekham\"&gt;Kumbhabhishekham&lt;/a&gt;\" (coronation after renovation) of the temple was performed on 23 May 2008. The construction of the \"Rajagopuram\" on the eastern side of temple started 45 years ago, but was completed only before the function following the Government issued orders for completing it at a cost of Rs 45 lakh. Rs 1 crore was spent for improving infrastructure at the temple, which included construction of additional compound wall, Annadanakudam, office complex and amenities for devotees."
