    "text": "Yevgeny Yufit (also known as Evgenii Iufit, 1961 \u2013 13 December 2016) was a Russian &lt;a href=\"filmmaker\"&gt;filmmaker&lt;/a&gt;, photographer and painter, born in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt;. He was a founding member of Russia's &lt;a href=\"Parallel%20Cinema%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Parallel Cinema&lt;/a&gt; movement.\nYufit first became famous for his macabre short films, which, like the films of &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Maddin\"&gt;Guy Maddin&lt;/a&gt;, often looked as though they had been made during the 1920s or 1930s. In the 1990s, Yufit began making features similar in style to his shorts, with plots often centered on &lt;a href=\"genetic%20experimentation\"&gt;genetic experimentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pseudoscience\"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. His most notable feature film is \"&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Heads\"&gt;Silver Heads&lt;/a&gt;\", made in 1998. He is often described as a &lt;a href=\"necrorealism\"&gt;necrorealist&lt;/a&gt;. He died on 13 December 2016 in &lt;a href=\"Petergof\"&gt;Petergof&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther reading.\nEaton, Thomas Dylan (2015), \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thewhitereview.org/feature/lenin-was-a-mushroom/\"&gt;LENIN WAS A MUSHROOM&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Review\"&gt;The White Review&lt;/a&gt;\" 14, pp.\u00a0155\u2013178."
