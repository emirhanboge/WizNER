    "text": "Horfield is a suburb of the city of &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, in southwest England. It lies on Bristol's northern edge, its border with &lt;a href=\"Filton\"&gt;Filton&lt;/a&gt; marking part of the boundary between Bristol and &lt;a href=\"South%20Gloucestershire\"&gt;South Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bishopston%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Bishopston&lt;/a&gt; lies directly to the south. &lt;a href=\"Monks%20Park\"&gt;Monks Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Hill%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Golden Hill&lt;/a&gt; are to the west. &lt;a href=\"Lockleaze\"&gt;Lockleaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Down\"&gt;Ashley Down&lt;/a&gt; are on the eastern fringe. The &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Road%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Gloucester Road&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"A38%20road\"&gt;A38&lt;/a&gt;) runs north\u2013south through the suburb.\nHorfield is also the name of a &lt;a href=\"Wards%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20Council\"&gt;Bristol City Council&lt;/a&gt;. The ward includes Monks Park and &lt;a href=\"Southmead%20Hospital\"&gt;Southmead Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, but does not include the southern part of Horfield, including Horfield Common and &lt;a href=\"Horfield%20Prison\"&gt;Horfield Prison&lt;/a&gt;, which is in Bishopston ward.\nHistory.\nThe name is &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; in origin, and means \"filthy open land\" (&lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"horu\" and \"feld\").\nHorfield was a parish in the &lt;a href=\"Berkeley%20%28hundred%29\"&gt;hundred of Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; in Gloucestershire, which included Bishopston, Golden Hill, Lockleaze and part of Ashley Down.\nHistorically, the area had a reputation as a lawless place because Horfield Wood was the haunt of thieves and vagrants. The area remained rural until the early 19th century.\nFollowing the 1831 &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Riots\"&gt;Bristol Riots&lt;/a&gt;, during which the local gaol burnt down, Horfield Prison was completed in 1847. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of &lt;a href=\"Horfield%20Barracks\"&gt;Horfield Barracks&lt;/a&gt; also in 1847.\nHorfield was mostly developed from the mid 19th century onwards. In 1859, Bishopston became a separate parish. The remainder of Horfield became a &lt;a href=\"civil%20parish\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; in 1866, when civil parishes were introduced. In 1894 Horfield Urban District was formed, but in 1904 it was absorbed into Bristol.\nAmenities.\nHorfield is home to the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Bristol%29\"&gt;Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;: a sports stadium built in 1921 for &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rugby\"&gt;Bristol Rugby Club&lt;/a&gt; in memory of the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; players of the city who died in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and rededicated to also commemorate the dead of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1996, the ground also became home to &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers Football Club&lt;/a&gt; who now own it. Bristol Rugby Club has since moved out of the ground and is now based at the Bristol City FC stadium in the south of the city.\nNear the Memorial Stadium is The Wellington, &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20for%20Real%20Ale\"&gt;CAMRA&lt;/a&gt; Bristol &amp; District joint winner of Pub of the Year for 2005. The 2006 Pub of the Year is also in Horfield, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//innonthegreenbristol.com/\"&gt;The Inn on the Green&lt;/a&gt; (on the Gloucester Road)\nHorfield has a leisure centre that was updated to have a 25-metre swimming pool in 2005. The leisure centre has a gym, swimming pool and learners pool, and a sports hall. Outside the complex is a small skateboard park. The leisure centre was built in the 1980s on open ground opposite the old Horfield Barracks, where open and closed-in rifle ranges once stood.\nOf Horfield's green spaces, Horfield Common is the largest, having a central enclosure of tennis courts and a bowling club. Horfield Common is one of Bristol's highest points of land above sea level.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bristol.gov.uk/libraries-archives/library-finder/-/journal_content/56/20195/LIBRARY-UPRN-000000018539/LIBRARY-DISPLAY\"&gt;Library&lt;/a&gt; on Filton Avenue.\nThere is a Primary School, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//filtonavenue.com/\"&gt;Filton Avenue Primary School&lt;/a&gt;, also on Filton Avenue.\nThere are two GP Surgeries that serve Horfield. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.horfieldhealthcentre.nhs.uk/\"&gt;Horfield Health Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.monksparksurgery.nhs.uk/\"&gt;Monks Park Surgery&lt;/a&gt;\nThe nearest hospital is \"&lt;a href=\"Southmead%20Hospital\"&gt;Southmead Hospital&lt;/a&gt;\", a large public National Health Service hospital, situated a short distance away in the Southmead ward of Bristol. It is part of the North Bristol NHS Trust.\nThe nearest Police Station used to be situated just west of Horfield on Southmead Road, however this was closed and replaced by a care home. The nearest Police Station is now a community police station based in the grounds of Southmead Hospital.\nTransport.\nHorfield is served by bus services on Gloucester Road (&lt;a href=\"First%20West%20of%20England\"&gt;First West of England&lt;/a&gt; routes 24, 25, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78 and 79 and &lt;a href=\"Wessex%20Connect\"&gt;Wessex Connect&lt;/a&gt; routes 3A, 3C commuter buses to Aztec West and 11,12, 15 and 19), and Muller Road (Wessex Connect routes 506 and 507).\nThe main road running through Horfield is the Gloucester Road section of the A38 and is the longest road of independent shops in the UK.\nHistorically, from the latter part of the 19th century until the first third of the 20th century, Horfield was served by Bristol's tram system, with Horfield having its own tram depot near the junction of Gloucester Road and Church Road. The tram depot site is now a petrol station and a doctor's surgery at the rear. Tram lines which once lead into the depot have been preserved in the surface of the car park of the surgery.\nBetween 1927 and 1964, the northeast part of the district was served by &lt;a href=\"Horfield%20railway%20station\"&gt;Horfield railway station&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable residents.\nFamous sons of Horfield include &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Grant\"&gt;Cary Grant&lt;/a&gt;, who was born at 15 Hughenden Road in 1904, and composer &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Steadman-Allen\"&gt;Ray Steadman-Allen&lt;/a&gt; was born at 64 Muller Road in 1922.
