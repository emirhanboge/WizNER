It is one of Barnet's 'Premier Parks'.\nIt is mainly grassed with a children's playground, football pitches, tennis and basketball courts, a bowling green and a car park. There are flower beds which are the remains of a formal &lt;a href=\"flower%20garden\"&gt;flower garden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe park is a roughly square area laid out in the late nineteenth century on land previously known as 'Mrs Cook's Farm', and &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet Football Club&lt;/a&gt; played there in the 1889\u201390 season.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shirebourne%20brook\"&gt;Shirebourne&lt;/a&gt; brook runs along the south side of the park and the &lt;a href=\"Pymmes%20Brook%20Trail\"&gt;Pymmes Brook Trail&lt;/a&gt; passes north\u2013south through the park.\nThere is access from Park Road, Victoria Road, Lawton Road, and by a footpath and footbridge from Cromer Road."
