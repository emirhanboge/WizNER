    "text": "The term \"&lt;a href=\"monument%20historique\"&gt;monument historique&lt;/a&gt;\" is a designation given to some national heritage sites in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. It may also refer to the state procedure in France by which National Heritage protection is extended to a building, a specific part of a building, a collection of buildings, garden, bridge, or other structure, because of their importance to France's architectural and historical cultural heritage. Both public and privately owned structures may be listed in this way, as well as also movable objects.\nExamples of buildings classified as monument historique include well known Parisian structures such as the &lt;a href=\"Eiffel%20Tower\"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Palais%20du%20Louvre\"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20Garnier\"&gt;Palais Garnier opera house&lt;/a&gt;, plus abbeys, churches such as &lt;a href=\"Abbaye%20de%20Saint-Germain-des-Pr%C3%A9s\"&gt;Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, and cathedrals such as &lt;a href=\"Cath%C3%A9drale%20Notre-Dame%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Notre-Dame de Paris&lt;/a&gt; or hotels such as the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Crillon\"&gt;Crillon&lt;/a&gt;.
