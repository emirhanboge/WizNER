    "title": "Pyramid wavefront sensor",
    "text": "A pyramid wavefront sensor is a type of a &lt;a href=\"wavefront%20sensor\"&gt;wavefront sensor&lt;/a&gt;. It measures the &lt;a href=\"optical%20aberration\"&gt;optical aberration&lt;/a&gt;s of an optical &lt;a href=\"wavefront\"&gt;wavefront&lt;/a&gt;. This wavefront sensor uses a pyramidal &lt;a href=\"prism\"&gt;prism&lt;/a&gt; with a large &lt;a href=\"Apex%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;apex angle&lt;/a&gt; to split the beam into multiple parts at the geometric &lt;a href=\"Focus%20%28optics%29\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Lens%20%28optics%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;. A four-faceted prism, with its tip centered at the peak of the point spread function, will generate four identical pupil images in the absence of optical aberrations. In the presence of optical aberrations, the intensity distribution among the pupils will change. The local wavefront gradients can be obtained by recording the distribution of intensity in the pupil images. The wavefront aberrations can be evaluated from the estimated wavefront gradients.\nIt has potential applications in &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ophthalmology\"&gt;ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.\nModulation.\nThe prism is often modulated (mechanically moved in a circle/square) for averaging purposes and to make sure that the ray spends an equal fraction of the total time on every face of the pyramidal prism. This makes the wavefront sensor slightly inconvenient to use due to the need for mechanically moving parts \u2013 either the prism or the beam is modulated. Using a light diffusing plate, mechanically moving parts can be eliminated. Alternatively, it has been shown that the need for mechanically moving parts can be overcome in a digital pyramid wavefront sensor with the &lt;a href=\"spatial%20light%20modulator\"&gt;spatial light modulator&lt;/a&gt;."
