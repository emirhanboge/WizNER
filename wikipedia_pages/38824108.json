    "text": "Joline Blais is a writer, educator, &lt;a href=\"new%20media\"&gt;new media&lt;/a&gt; scholar, and &lt;a href=\"permaculture\"&gt;permaculture&lt;/a&gt; designer.\nAs Associate Professor in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Maine\"&gt;University of Maine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"http%3A//newmedia.umaine.edu\"&gt;New Media Department&lt;/a&gt;, Blais teaches classes on digital narrative, &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20design\"&gt;sustainable design&lt;/a&gt;, and permaculture. With &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Ippolito\"&gt;Jon Ippolito&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, she co-founded &lt;a href=\"Still%20Water\"&gt;Still Water&lt;/a&gt;, a new media &lt;a href=\"Laboratory\"&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; she continues to co-direct that is devoted to studying and building creative &lt;a href=\"Social%20network\"&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt;. Blais' publications and creative work explore the overlap of &lt;a href=\"digital%20culture\"&gt;digital culture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous culture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"permaculture\"&gt;permaculture&lt;/a&gt; which has included advocacy for updated tenure and promotion criteria based on sharing rather than hierarchical principles.\nSelected Projects.\nBlais' 2006 book &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.amazon.com/dp/0500238227\"&gt;At the Edge of Art&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored with Ippolito and published by &lt;a href=\"Thames%20%26amp%3B%20Hudson\"&gt;Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, investigates how new media art puts the power of networks and distributed creativity into the hands of ordinary citizens in a variety of non-art contexts. The book creates a metaphor between &lt;a href=\"digital%20art\"&gt;digital art&lt;/a&gt; and the human &lt;a href=\"immune%20system\"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, relating the auto-immune response to the important role of art in society. In this book Blais coins the terms \"autobotography,\" personal histories automatically recorded by digital devices such as &lt;a href=\"webcam\"&gt;webcam&lt;/a&gt;s and blogs, and \"executability,\" an ability of 21st-century expression to operate on computable, social, or legal codes.\nBlais and collaborators, including &lt;a href=\"John%20P.%20Bell\"&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Ippolito, and Owen Smith, developed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pool.newmedia.umaine.edu\"&gt;The Pool&lt;/a&gt;, an online project design workspace noted by the &lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; as a \"new avenue for new-media scholars to do their jobs.\" The Pool is a collaborative online environment for creating art, &lt;a href=\"code\"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Text%20file\"&gt;texts&lt;/a&gt;. In place of the single-artist, single-artwork paradigm favored by the overwhelming majority of documentation systems, The Pool stimulates &lt;a href=\"collaboration\"&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of forms, including multi-author, asynchronous, and cross-medium projects.\nIn 2005 Blais partnered with New York's &lt;a href=\"Eyebeam%20Art%20and%20Technology%20Center\"&gt;Eyebeam Art and Technology Center&lt;/a&gt; to conceive and produce an online forum on open culture that spanned six weeks and four continents. Entitled &lt;a href=\"Distributed%20creativity\"&gt;Distributed creativity&lt;/a&gt;, this system wove together correspondents from separate email lists based in California (&lt;a href=\"Creative%20Commons\"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;), New York (&lt;a href=\"Rhizome%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Rhizome&lt;/a&gt;), Ireland (DATA), India (&lt;a href=\"The%20Sarai%20Programme%20at%20CSDS\"&gt;Sarai&lt;/a&gt;), and Australia (Fibreculture) in a global conversation on the future of creativity, intellectual property, and mobile media.\nHer sustainability projects include &lt;a href=\"http%3A//longgreenhouse.org\"&gt;LongGreenHouse&lt;/a&gt; (2007\u20132011), which wove the &lt;a href=\"Wabanaki%20Confederacy\"&gt;Wabanaki&lt;/a&gt; Longhouse, permaculture gardens, and networked collaboration in a hybrid \"communiversity,\" in partnership with UMaine, the Wassookeag school, and Wabanaki elders. Other projects include RFC: Request for Ceremony, a call for re-investing quotidian life with ceremony; and the Cross-Cultural Partnership, a legal framework for developing trust networks with indigenous peoples.\nIn 2008 Blais expanded this work from the university to community contexts as a partner and equity member of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//MaineCohousing.org\"&gt;Belfast Cohousing &amp; Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Carbon%20neutrality\"&gt;net zero&lt;/a&gt; prototype house was the US Green Building Council's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.usgbc.org/Docs/News/LEED%2520for%2520Homes%2520Awards%25202011.pdf\"&gt;2011 Project of the Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelected publications.\nJoline Blais and Jon Ippolito, \"Art As Antibody: A Redefinition of Art for the Internet Age,\" Intelligent Agent 6, no. 2 (Summer 2006), mirrored at http://www.intelligentagent.com/archive/ia6_2_transvergence_blaisippolito_artasantibody.pdf.\nJoline Blais and Jon Ippolito, At the Edge of Art (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006).\nJoline Blais, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//thoughtmesh.net/publish/6.php\"&gt;Indigenous Domain: Pilgrims, Permaculture, and Perl&lt;/a&gt;\nJoline Blais, Jon Ippolito, Steve Evans, Owen Smith, and Nate Stormer, \"New Criteria for New Media,\" Leonardo (MIT Press) 42, no. 1 (Spring 2009).\nJoline Blais and Jon Ippolito, \"New Media Innovators,\" in Lucas Dietrich, ed., 60: Innovators Shaping Our Creative Future (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2010).\nJoline Blais, Jon Ippolito, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Lessig\"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;, and Carrie McLaren, \"Share/Share Alike,\" Intelligent Agent (New York and Baton Rouge) 4.2 (June 2004), http://www.intelligentagent.com."
