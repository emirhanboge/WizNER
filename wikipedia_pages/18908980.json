    "text": "The aptly nicknamed Skinny House at 708 Gladys Avenue (corner of 7th Street) in the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Park%2C%20Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Rose Park&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, is a narrow three-story &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; that has been cited by both the &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ripley%27s%20Believe%20It%20or%20Not\"&gt;Ripley's Believe It or Not&lt;/a&gt; as the nation's skinniest house.\nThe yellow-&lt;a href=\"stucco\"&gt;stucco&lt;/a&gt;ed house was built on a lot measuring by in 1932 by Newton P. Rummonds, who received the land as a repayment for a $100 loan one year earlier. He built the house after someone bet him that he could not build a habitable house on such a small lot.\nIn 1959, it was discovered that the house had leaned to the north and was straightened. The Skinny House is a registered city landmark of Long Beach, California, as of 1983.\nPublic interest lawyer &lt;a href=\"William%20John%20Cox\"&gt;William John Cox&lt;/a&gt; maintained his law practice in Skinny House between 1977 and 1981, including his prosecution of the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20denial\"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt; case.\nThe house was featured in a segment of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Early%20Show\"&gt;The Early Show&lt;/a&gt;\"."
