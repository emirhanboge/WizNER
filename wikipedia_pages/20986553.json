For Christmas he got a laptop and looked at American football kickers seeing how far they could kick and then went on holiday to the United States and filmed himself kicking &lt;a href=\"field%20goal\"&gt;field goal&lt;/a&gt;s from . After encouragement from fellow South African former &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; kicker &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Anderson%20%28placekicker%29\"&gt;Gary Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, Pretorius sent copies of the tape to several American universities and was invited to join Ohio State University as a &lt;a href=\"walk-on%20%28sports%29\"&gt;walk-on&lt;/a&gt;.
