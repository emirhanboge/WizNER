    "text": "Liemar (unknown \u2013 16 May 1101, in Bremen) was &lt;a href=\"archbishop%20of%20Hamburg-Bremen\"&gt;archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen&lt;/a&gt; from 1072 to 1101, and an important figure of the early &lt;a href=\"Investiture%20Contest\"&gt;Investiture Contest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Henry%20IV\"&gt;Emperor Henry IV&lt;/a&gt; from 1073. In 1074 the &lt;a href=\"papal%20legate\"&gt;papal legate&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20of%20Ostia\"&gt;Gerald of Ostia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20of%20Palestrina\"&gt;Hubert of Palestrina&lt;/a&gt; put pressure on him to hold a local &lt;a href=\"synod\"&gt;synod&lt;/a&gt;; he resisted, was suspended, and by 1075 his views against papal interference with bishops had hardened. In 1080, he attended the &lt;a href=\"Synod%20of%20Brixen\"&gt;Synod of Brixen&lt;/a&gt; that condemned &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20VII\"&gt;Pope Gregory VII&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Benno%20II%20of%20Osnabr%C3%BCck\"&gt;Benno II of Osnabr\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt; he commissioned the anti-papal polemic of &lt;a href=\"Wido%20of%20Osnabr%C3%BCck\"&gt;Wido of Osnabr\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt; around 1085. Liemar was one of many bishops who was irked by Gregory VII's encroachment of episcopal autonomy. In a letter to Bishop Hezilo of Hildesheim, Liemar complained that Gregory VII was ordering his bishops about 'as though they were his bailiffs'. "
