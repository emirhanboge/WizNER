    "title": "Nasal sebum",
    "text": "Nasal sebum, also known as nose grease/oil, is &lt;a href=\"grease%20%28lubricant%29\"&gt;grease&lt;/a&gt; removed from the surface of the &lt;a href=\"human%20nose\"&gt;human nose&lt;/a&gt;. The pores of the lateral creases (where the nose joins the face) of the exterior of the nose create and store more oil and grease than pores elsewhere on the human body, forming a readily available source of small quantities of grease or oil. The grease is a particularly oily form of &lt;a href=\"sebum\"&gt;sebum&lt;/a&gt;, thought to contain more &lt;a href=\"squalene\"&gt;squalene&lt;/a&gt; (C30H50) than the secretions from other parts of the skin. It is notable because nose grease is a convenient durable &lt;a href=\"lubricant\"&gt;lubricant&lt;/a&gt;.\nNose grease can be used to minimize scratches in optical surfaces, for example when cleaning photographic negatives. &lt;a href=\"Observatory\"&gt;Observatory&lt;/a&gt; lore holds that nose grease was used to reduce &lt;a href=\"stray%20light\"&gt;stray light&lt;/a&gt; and reflections in transmissive &lt;a href=\"telescope\"&gt;telescope&lt;/a&gt;s before the development of vacuum antireflective coatings. The antireflective properties are due in part to the fact that the nose oil fills small cracks and scratches and forms a smooth, polished surface, and in part to the low &lt;a href=\"index%20of%20refraction\"&gt;index of refraction&lt;/a&gt; of the oil, which can reduce surface reflection from transmissive optics that have a high index of refraction. The same effect is sometimes used by &lt;a href=\"numismatic\"&gt;numismatic&lt;/a&gt; hobbyists to alter the apparent grade of slightly worn coins.\nNose grease is often recommended as a lubricant for fly fishing rod ferrules. \nNose grease has mild antifoaming properties and can be used to break down a high &lt;a href=\"beer%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; on freshly poured &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"soft%20drinks\"&gt;soft drinks&lt;/a&gt;. Wiping nose grease onto one's finger and then touching or stirring the foam causes it to dissipate rapidly.\n\"The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies\" suggests using nasal sebum as a remedy for &lt;a href=\"chapped%20lips\"&gt;chapped lips&lt;/a&gt;."
