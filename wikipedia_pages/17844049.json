    "text": "Strays is a 1997 American &lt;a href=\"drama%20film\"&gt;drama film&lt;/a&gt; written, directed, produced by, and starring &lt;a href=\"Vin%20Diesel\"&gt;Vin Diesel&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a drug dealer and &lt;a href=\"Pimp\"&gt;hustler&lt;/a&gt; who is fed up with the repetitious lifestyle he leads and begins looking for meaning in his life. It marked Diesel's feature film directing debut and takes a hard look at his own adolescence and upbringing in New York City.\nSynopsis.\nFrustrated by the repetitious grind of &lt;a href=\"one-night%20stand\"&gt;one-night stand&lt;/a&gt;s and aimless hustling, Rick (&lt;a href=\"Vin%20Diesel\"&gt;Vin Diesel&lt;/a&gt;) is looking for meaning in his life. Like his testosterone-tweaked buddies, Rick is a stray looking for a traditional family structure and wrestling unconsciously with his own father's absence. He sells small amounts of marijuana to cover the expenses of his own use but insists that he is not doing it for a living.\nWhen he meets Heather (&lt;a href=\"Suzanne%20Lanza\"&gt;Suzanne Lanza&lt;/a&gt;), the girl next door, he suddenly perceives a new avenue and an opportunity for a new, committed relationship. Trying to assimilate into Heather's world, Rick takes heat from his perpetually adolescent cohorts whose ambitions are restricted to riding fast, toking slow, and ditching hard. Though the chemistry between the couple is immediately charged, Rick's street chic and volatile aggression threaten to extinguish their relationship before it has ever begun."
