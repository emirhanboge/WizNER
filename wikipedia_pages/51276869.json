    "text": "Sir Humphrey Stafford,(\u00a01341 \u2013 31 October 1413), of &lt;a href=\"Southwick%2C%20Wiltshire\"&gt;Southwick, Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Hooke%2C%20Dorset\"&gt;Hooke, Dorset&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Bramshall\"&gt;Bramshall&lt;/a&gt;, Staffordshire, was a member of the fifteenth-century English &lt;a href=\"gentry\"&gt;gentry&lt;/a&gt;. He held royal offices firstly in the county of his birth, and later in the west country, particularly &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dorset\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt;, and has been called 'one of the wealthiest commoners in England' of the period.\nEarly life and career.\nHumphrey Stafford was born some time after 1341, the eldest son of Sir John Stafford of &lt;a href=\"Amblecote\"&gt;Amblecote&lt;/a&gt; and his second wife, Margaret Stafford (a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Stafford\"&gt;Ralph, 1st Earl of Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, a distant relation). &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Stafford%20%28MP%29\"&gt;Ralph Stafford&lt;/a&gt; was his brother. His first official positions ranged from tax assessor for &lt;a href=\"Wiltshire\"&gt;Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt; (1379), &lt;a href=\"Justice%20of%20the%20Peace\"&gt;JP&lt;/a&gt; for the same county a year later, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20of%20Staffordshire\"&gt;Sheriff of Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; (1383\u20134), and Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Warwickshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt; during the October 1383 parliament. Prior to his long parliamentary career, he was primarily a soldier of the crown, generally &lt;a href=\"Retainer%20%28medieval%29\"&gt;retained&lt;/a&gt; in the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Stafford\"&gt;Earls of Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, campaigning in France (in 1359), Ireland (1361), and &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; (1373).\nFamily.\nStafford married twice. In 1365 he married Alice Greville (born \u00a01345) of &lt;a href=\"Southwick%2C%20Wiltshire\"&gt;Southwick, Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was a &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28law%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Humphrey%20de%20Bohun%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Hereford\"&gt;Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford&lt;/a&gt;, and brought Stafford &lt;a href=\"estate%20%28law%29\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt;s in Warwickshire as well as the manor of &lt;a href=\"Southwick%20Court\"&gt;Southwick Court&lt;/a&gt;. His second marriage, around 1387, to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20d%27Aumarle\"&gt;Elizabeth d'Aumarle&lt;/a&gt; (\u00a01345 \u2013 1413) (daughter of William d'Aumarle) gave him those lands in the south-west which formed his later power-base, and allowed him to stand for the &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary constituency for the subsequent twelve parliaments. His second wife also brought him Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Bonville\"&gt;William Bonville&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shute%20Barton\"&gt;Shute&lt;/a&gt; (died 1408) as a brother-in-law. Elizabeth d'Aumarle also married John Maultravers (c. 1342 \u2013 1386) of Hooke, Dorset.\nLater career.\nIn 1388, Humphrey Stafford was eventually caught up in the crisis of the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20Appellant\"&gt;Lords Appellant&lt;/a&gt;, being required by them to take oaths of loyalty to the regime in Dorset. It was at this time \u2013 in a possibly related incident \u2013 that members of the &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20people\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt; gentry conspired to assassinate him, eventually managing to shoot him 'with a certain engine called a \"gunne\" so that his life was despaired of.' However, since at the same time he loaned King &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt; 100 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%28currency%29\"&gt;marks&lt;/a&gt;, and later received a royal appointment to assess the Appellants' &lt;a href=\"Forfeiture%20%28law%29\"&gt;forfeited&lt;/a&gt; lands there, the king clearly did not see Stafford as a major player in the rebellion locally. Following Richard II's deposition by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry Bollingbroke&lt;/a&gt; in 1399, Stafford does not seem to have lost royal favour by his previous support for the old king; indeed, within a few weeks of Henry's coronation he was referred to as a 'King's Knight' and was &lt;a href=\"Grant%20%28law%29\"&gt;granted&lt;/a&gt; the royal &lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Seavington%20St%20Mary\"&gt;Seavington&lt;/a&gt;, Somerset. By now Stafford was, in &lt;a href=\"E.F.%20Jacob\"&gt;E.F. Jacob&lt;/a&gt;'s words, 'a shire knight of standing and influence,' and of all the gentry in the county, Humphrey was 'at their head for wealth.' His estates were valued in the 1412 tax assessment at around \u00a3570 \"per annum\".\nDeath.\nStafford died on 31 October 1413. In his will he left, among other things, his household servants one pound each; to his &lt;a href=\"Groom%20%28profession%29\"&gt;groom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"%C2%A3sd\"&gt;6s.8d.&lt;/a&gt; apiece; and to his &lt;a href=\"Page%20%28servant%29\"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;s, half that amount. The majority of his bequests were to ecclesiastic institutions: over \u00a323 to &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, \u00a320 to the &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; Abbey in &lt;a href=\"Abbotsbury%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbotsbury&lt;/a&gt;, and \u00a38 for two-years' worth of &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es for Stafford's soul. His wife had died two weeks previously. His &lt;a href=\"heir\"&gt;heir&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Humphrey%20Stafford%20%28died%201442%29\"&gt;Sir Humphrey Stafford&lt;/a&gt; (died 1442). Stafford also left an illegitimate son, &lt;a href=\"John%20Stafford%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, by one Emma, of &lt;a href=\"North%20Bradley\"&gt;North Bradley&lt;/a&gt;; he was the subject of a &lt;a href=\"Papal%20dispensation\"&gt;Papal dispensation&lt;/a&gt; in 1408, rose through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually became &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells\"&gt;Bishop of Bath and Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20England\"&gt;Chancellor of England&lt;/a&gt;."
