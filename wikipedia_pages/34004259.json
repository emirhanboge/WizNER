    "text": "Giuseppina Tuissi, better known as Gianna (also \"La Staffetta Gianna\"; 23 June 1923 \u2013 23 June 1945) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Partisan%20%28military%29\"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Garibaldi%20Brigades\"&gt;52nd Brigata Garibaldi \"Luigi Clerici\"&lt;/a&gt;\". From September 1944 she was the collaborator of the partisan &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Canali\"&gt;Luigi Canali&lt;/a&gt; (known as the captain \"Neri\") and, with him, had an important role in the arrest and the execution of &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clara%20Petacci\"&gt;Clara Petacci&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nGiuseppina was born in 1923 in &lt;a href=\"Abbiategrasso\"&gt;Abbiategrasso&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Milan\"&gt;Province of Milan&lt;/a&gt;, but lived and worked as &lt;a href=\"laborer\"&gt;laborer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baggio%20%28district%20of%20Milan%29\"&gt;Baggio&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1943 she started her activity of partisan courier, using the pseudonym \"Gianna\". On 6 January 1945 she was arrested with Luigi Canali in &lt;a href=\"Lezzeno\"&gt;Lezzeno&lt;/a&gt; by the members of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Brigades\"&gt;XI Black Brigade \"Cesare Rodini\"&lt;/a&gt; and tortured for 23 days. After this period she was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Schutzstaffel\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; headquarter in &lt;a href=\"Monza\"&gt;Monza&lt;/a&gt; by the initiative of a &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; officer, the captain Vernig, moved to pity for her conditions and impressed for her bravery. On March 12 she was released. Refusing an escape route to &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, \"Gianna\" continued participating to the partisan struggle in northern &lt;a href=\"Lombardy\"&gt;Lombardy&lt;/a&gt;. She and \"Neri\" were present during the arrest of Benito Mussolini and Clara Petacci, on 27 April near &lt;a href=\"Dongo%2C%20Lombardy\"&gt;Dongo&lt;/a&gt;; and to their execution, the day after, in &lt;a href=\"Giulino\"&gt;Giulino&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuspected of betrayal, to have revealed some names of partisans during her detention, she was arrested in Baggio on April 29 and detained until May 9, inquired by &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Vergani\"&gt;Pietro Vergani&lt;/a&gt;, regional commander of the Garibaldi Brigades and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;PCI&lt;/a&gt; member. During the detention she became aware of the death of Luigi Canali, executed by a partisan tribunal.\nAt the end of May 1945 she come in &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; with Alice Canali, the sister of Luigi, to know more about his death. Despite threats, \"Gianna\" continued to ask questions threatening to reveal what she learned. In June she also met Ferruccio Lanfranchi, editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"Corriere%20d%27Informazione\"&gt;Corriere d'Informazione&lt;/a&gt;\", that is investigating on the death of Mussolini. Feeling abandoned by the comrades of her party, \"Gianna\" disappeared on 23 June 1945, in the day of her 22nd birthday. It is presumed she was killed and her body thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Como\"&gt;Lake of Como&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cernobbio\"&gt;Cernobbio&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer death, the one of \"Neri\" and other partisans in the late spring of 1945, represents an unresolved mystery of the Italian resistance history. In 1957 &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Gorreri\"&gt;Dante Gorreri&lt;/a&gt;, PCI secretary of &lt;a href=\"Como\"&gt;Como&lt;/a&gt;, and Pietro Vergani, were charged for the murder as instigators; Dionisio Gambaruto and Maurizio Bernasconi as executors. The trial, held in &lt;a href=\"Padua\"&gt;Padua&lt;/a&gt;, did not end for a series of procedural impediments."
