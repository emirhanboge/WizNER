    "text": "Garzia de' Medici (July 5, 1547 \u2013 December 6, 1562) was the son of &lt;a href=\"Cosimo%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20of%20Toledo\"&gt;Eleanor of Toledo&lt;/a&gt;. He was the subject of a famous painting by &lt;a href=\"Bronzino\"&gt;Bronzino&lt;/a&gt; when he was an infant. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; and died of &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; along with his mother while traveling to &lt;a href=\"Pisa\"&gt;Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, a few days after his brother, &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20de%27%20Medici%20%28cardinal%29\"&gt;Cardinal Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;, also died of the disease.\nEarly years.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, he was the son of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleanor of Toledo. His parents had planned for him a military career, and at only 13 years old he had been named Honorary Commander and Supreme Commander of the Tuscan &lt;a href=\"galley\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMalaria and death.\nIn 1562, he accompanied his father and brothers &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20de%27%20Medici%20%28cardinal%29\"&gt;Giovanni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ferdinando%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Ferdinando&lt;/a&gt;, to the Tuscan coast to embark to &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, where the eldest son &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Francesco&lt;/a&gt; lived. But his mother Eleanor and the children contracted &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, and all except Ferdinando died in a few weeks.\nMany of sudden deaths in the family of the Duke immediately aroused the suspicions of the family, who also attended the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Trent\"&gt;Council of Trent&lt;/a&gt;. Several sources confirm, however, that during the period there was a violent flu epidemic.\nCenturies after his death, a myth arose saying that Garzia had murdered his brother, Giovanni, following a dispute in 1562. In turn, his father Cosimo, furious, killed Garzia with his own sword. However, modern exhumations showed no signs of violence on the bodies and found to have died together of malaria in 1562."
