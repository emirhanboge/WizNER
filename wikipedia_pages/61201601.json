    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"firearm\"&gt;firearm&lt;/a&gt;s, barrel threads refer to the &lt;a href=\"screw%20thread\"&gt;screw thread&lt;/a&gt;s used to attach a &lt;a href=\"gun%20barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAction threads, also called receiver threads, are situated at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; end of the barrel, and can be used for attaching the barrel to the &lt;a href=\"receiver%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt;. The receiver normally has corresponding threads which are internal, with the matching action threads on the barrel usually being external threads. This design is most commonly used in &lt;a href=\"rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"revolver\"&gt;revolver&lt;/a&gt;s, but also on some &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s. This method of fixing a barrel to a receiver has been used extensively by firearms manufacturers since before the 20th century, and can be viewed as a traditional barrel mounting method. Action threads are not the only method of fixing a barrel to a receiver (see \"Alternative methods\" below). Furthermore, some firearm designs have moving instead of fixed barrels (e.g. most &lt;a href=\"recoil%20operation\"&gt;recoil operated&lt;/a&gt; pistols or the &lt;a href=\"Barrett%20M82\"&gt;Barrett M82&lt;/a&gt; rifle).\nMuzzle threads are situated at the &lt;a href=\"Gun%20barrel%23Muzzle\"&gt;muzzle&lt;/a&gt; end of the barrel and can be used for mounting accessories such as a &lt;a href=\"flash%20hider\"&gt;flash hider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20brake\"&gt;muzzle brake&lt;/a&gt; (compensator).\nDesignation.\nThere are many systems for designating thread types (&lt;a href=\"ISO%20metric%20screw%20thread\"&gt;metric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unified%20Thread%20Standard\"&gt;unified&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Standard%20Whitworth\"&gt;Whitworth&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Threading can be specified by diameter, &lt;a href=\"Screw%20thread%23Lead%2C%20pitch%2C%20and%20starts\"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thread%20angle\"&gt;angle&lt;/a&gt;, length and fit tolerances. However, the use of action threads is not well standardized within the firearms industry, and threading can vary between manufacturers and models.\nFor example, factory and aftermarket receivers using the &lt;a href=\"Remington%20700\"&gt;Remington 700&lt;/a&gt; footprint are produced with various types of action threads, all with a diameter, but with a pitch of either a 1.588\u00a0mm (16\u00a0TPI, Remington standard), 1.411\u00a0mm (18\u00a0TPI) or 1.270\u00a0mm (20\u00a0TPI, Savage standard).\nTypically, many rifles use thread diameters in the range between . Many older rifles from the first half of the 20th century use a thread pitch around 2\u00a0mm (12.7\u00a0TPI), while many modern rifle use thread pitches around 1.5\u00a0mm (16.93\u00a0TPI). Fine threaded systems intended for hand tightening typically use thread pitches around 1\u00a0mm (25.4\u00a0TPI).\nMounting.\nUsing action threads to mount a barrel to a receiver typically requires fitting by a competent &lt;a href=\"gunsmith\"&gt;gunsmith&lt;/a&gt;, and typically some &lt;a href=\"machining\"&gt;machining&lt;/a&gt; has to be done. \nIn this process it is important so set the correct &lt;a href=\"Headspace%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;headspace&lt;/a&gt;. Correct mounting is important both for safety and accuracy. If the barrel, receiver and bolt are not fitted properly, severe and potential fatal problems can arise due to faulty headspace, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Cartridge%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;cartridge&lt;/a&gt; overpressure and case rupture. Threaded barrels are often mounted to the receiver with a lot of torque, and will therefore generally require tools for assembly and disassembly, such as a suitable action &lt;a href=\"wrench\"&gt;wrench&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"vise\"&gt;vise&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the firearm, a recoil lug is sometimes fitted between the barrel and stock as part of the process, \nCleaning up the receiver and barrel action threads is often done during \"blueprinting\" in order to &lt;a href=\"Accurizing\"&gt;increase accuracy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAction threads.\nAlternative methods.\nSeveral alternative mounting methods to using action threads exist.\nMuzzle threads.\nMuzzle threads is one method of fitting accessories such as flash hiders, suppressors or muzzle brakes (compensators). The applicable thread is limited to a certain degree by the bullet caliber and barrel diameter. Right-hand threads (RH) are most common, but left-hand threads (LH) are sometimes used instead. Unless otherwise stated, right-hand threads are usually assumed. \nIn Europe it has become common to use 1\u00a0mm muzzle thread pitches. M14x1 is a common thread type on European hunting barrels, while M18x1 is common on competition bull barrels. A larger barrel thread diameter can improve the precision of the barrel. As of 2021, various &lt;a href=\"Unified%20Thread%20Standard\"&gt;Unified threads&lt;/a&gt; are still the de facto standard on most American firearms, such as 1/2\"-28 (M12.7x0.907) on 5.6\u00a0mm (.223\") caliber rifles and 5/8\"-24 (M15.88x1.058) on 7.62\u00a0mm (.308\") calibers.\nSome common barrel threads are listed below:\nExternal threads on muzzle accessories.\nSome accessories, notably &lt;a href=\"Silencer%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;suppressors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"concussion%20reduction%20device\"&gt;concussion reduction device&lt;/a&gt;s (CRDs), attach via a muzzle device such as a &lt;a href=\"flash%20hider\"&gt;flash hider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20brake\"&gt;compensator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thread%20protector\"&gt;thread protector&lt;/a&gt; or sleeve."
