    "text": "The Riihim\u00e4ki\u2013Saint Petersburg railway is a long segment of the &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20Central%20railway%20station\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; connection, which is divided between Saint Petersburg and &lt;a href=\"Leningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Leningrad Oblast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the province of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Finland\"&gt;Southern Finland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIt was constructed in 1867\u201370 (starting from both ends), entirely by the government of the autonomous &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Finland&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, although the short section between Saint Petersburg and &lt;a href=\"Beloostrov\"&gt;Beloostrov&lt;/a&gt; (where Russian customs was situated in 1870\u20131939) was laid in Russia (&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg%20Governorate\"&gt;Saint Petersburg Governorate&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Finlyandsky%20Rail%20Terminal\"&gt;Finlyandsky Rail Terminal&lt;/a&gt; was opened in Saint Petersburg in 1870 in order to serve this line.\nThe rail link starts at the &lt;a href=\"Riihim%C3%A4ki%20railway%20station\"&gt;Riihim\u00e4ki railway station&lt;/a&gt; of the connection, heading towards the Finlyandsky Railway Terminal of Saint Petersburg through &lt;a href=\"Lahti%20railway%20station\"&gt;Lahti railway station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kouvola%20railway%20station\"&gt;Kouvola railway station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vyborg%20railway%20station\"&gt;Vyborg railway station&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Viipuri/Viborg/Wiborg) and &lt;a href=\"Zelenogorsk%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Zelenogorsk&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Terijoki).\nIt wasn't until 1913 when the line became connected to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20railways\"&gt;Russian railways&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Finland%20Railway%20Bridge\"&gt;Finland Railway Bridge&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"River%20Neva\"&gt;River Neva&lt;/a&gt; in Saint Petersburg was opened.\nUntil 1917, when Finland became an independent state, the railroad had been operated by the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20State%20Railways\"&gt;Finnish State Railways&lt;/a&gt; for all its length, including that section. Due to construction of the southern sections of the railroad, the western part of the &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Isthmus\"&gt;Karelian Isthmus&lt;/a&gt; on both sides of the Russian-Finnish border became a popular \"&lt;a href=\"dacha\"&gt;dacha&lt;/a&gt;\" resort place among wealthy St. Petersburgers in the late nineteenth century. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; (1939\u201340) and &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt; (1941\u201344), concluded with the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty\"&gt;Moscow Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Armistice\"&gt;Moscow Armistice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Peace%20Treaties\"&gt;Paris Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Isthmus\"&gt;Karelian Isthmus&lt;/a&gt; with the eastern part of the railroad (from Louko (Pogranitshnoye) to Rajajoki (western part of &lt;a href=\"Sestroretsk\"&gt;Sestroretsk&lt;/a&gt;)) was ceded by Finland to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. The railway stations Louko (Pogranitshnoye) and Rajajoki were abandoned by Russians.\nIn 2006, the high speed railway from &lt;a href=\"Lahti\"&gt;Lahti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kerava\"&gt;Kerava&lt;/a&gt; was opened, and that cut half an hour off the travel time from Helsinki. In 2010, the speed was raised to 200\u00a0km/h most of distance Lahti\u2013St Petersburg. The freight traffic will be later moved to another upgraded railway, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg%E2%80%93Hiitola%20railroad\"&gt;Saint Petersburg\u2013Hiitola railroad&lt;/a&gt;. This and the introduction of high speed trains of type &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Trains%20Class%20Sm6\"&gt;Sm6&lt;/a&gt; cut the travel time by two hours to about 3:30. The railway upgrade cost in Finland was \u20ac244M, with an EU contribution of \u20ac23M.\nAt present.\nThe international high-speed train &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Trains%20Class%20Sm6\"&gt;Allegro&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Trains\"&gt;Karelian Trains&lt;/a&gt;, Helsinki\u2013St. Petersburg) and the sleeper train Tolstoy (Russian Railways, Moscow\u2013St. Petersburg\u2013Helsinki) run daily on this route between Hakosilta and Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. The Russian part of the railroad is used by suburban trains (\"&lt;a href=\"elektrichka\"&gt;elektrichka&lt;/a&gt;s\") of the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal with their final destinations at &lt;a href=\"Zelenogorsk%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Zelenogorsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roshchino\"&gt;Roshchino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pobeda%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Kannelj\u00e4rvi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirillovskoye%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Kirillovskoye&lt;/a&gt;, Gavrilovo (K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4) or &lt;a href=\"Vyborg%20railway%20station\"&gt;Vyborg&lt;/a&gt;, as well as elektrichkas Vyborg\u2013&lt;a href=\"Buslovskaya\"&gt;Buslovskaya&lt;/a&gt; (Houni). \nThe railroad is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Vyborg%E2%80%93Joensuu%20railroad\"&gt;Vyborg\u2013Joensuu railroad&lt;/a&gt; at Vyborg, to a number of tracks, including the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg%E2%80%93Hiitola%20railroad\"&gt;Saint Petersburg\u2013Hiitola railroad&lt;/a&gt;, at the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal of St. Petersburg, and also has links to Kerava from Hakosilta, to Vesij\u00e4rvi, Loviisa and Heinola from Lahti, to Kotka and Mikkeli from Kouvola, to Joensuu from Luum\u00e4ki, to &lt;a href=\"Primorsk%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Primorsk&lt;/a&gt; (Koivisto) from Lazarevka (Liimatta) and Zelenogorsk (Terijoki), to &lt;a href=\"Veshchevo\"&gt;Veshchevo&lt;/a&gt; (Heinjoki) (and earlier as far as to &lt;a href=\"Zhitkovo\"&gt;Zhitkovo&lt;/a&gt; (Ristsepp\u00e4l\u00e4) and &lt;a href=\"Michurinskoye%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Michurniskoye&lt;/a&gt; (Valkj\u00e4rvi) from Lazarevka and with Sestroretsk from Beloostrov and Lanskaya. Besides, the line has also a number of short blind branches.\nAs the Russian part of the tracks is planned to be renovated to handle &lt;a href=\"high-speed%20rail\"&gt;high-speed&lt;/a&gt; international trains (see &lt;a href=\"Karelian%20Trains\"&gt;Karelian Trains&lt;/a&gt;) and to be used exclusively for passenger traffic, the cargo traffic (mostly lumber, granite rubble, oil) is expected to be switched to the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg%E2%80%93Hiitola%20railroad\"&gt;Saint Petersburg\u2013Hiitola railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nStations and branches.\nInternational train stops are bolded. Former names (most of the stations ceded to the Soviet Union were renamed in 1948), distance (from Riihim\u00e4ki for the Finnish part and from St. Petersburg for the Russian part) and suburban tariff zones (for the Russian part) are given in brackets."
