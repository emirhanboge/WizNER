    "text": "Zamna () is a river in eastern &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, the right tributary to the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt;. Its valley is known for the caves, arches and a canyon. Local population also calls it Zemna.\nCourse and geography.\nZamna originates on the eastern slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Deli%20Jovan\"&gt;Deli Jovan&lt;/a&gt; mountain, below the Crni Vrh, at an altitude of . It originally flows in an easterly direction. At the village of &lt;a href=\"Plavna%20%28Negotin%29\"&gt;Plavna&lt;/a&gt;, it receives the river Medve\u0111a (also known as Medvedica) from the left. At the mouth, the river formed \"prerast\", or natural arch. Obscured by the thick forest, it is called \"Rajski prerast\" (\"Paradise Arch\") and is away from the center of the village. Cave arches are formed when the porous, limestone ceiling of the cave collapses. Zamna's \"Paradise Arch\" is the tallest rocky arch in Europe.\nAustrian traveler &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Philipp%20Kanitz\"&gt;Felix Philipp Kanitz&lt;/a&gt; visited the area in the second half of the 19th century. He described the Deli Jovan mountain as rising above the river in four terraces, and the local tree flora which at the time included &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"walnut\"&gt;walnut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hazel\"&gt;hazel&lt;/a&gt;. The area was properly explored for the first time in 1895 by the geographer &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Cviji%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan Cviji\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. He gave scientific explanations for the creation of the arches.\nThe cave was formed by the river, which also in time caused ceiling's collapses on two locations. These roof openings are called \"vigledi\". The cave is actually one, continuous cave tunnel. It is long. Entry section is tall and wide. while the ending cavity is and wide. As the holes in the collapsed ceiling are apart, the tunnel is completely lit with daylight. The cave itself is still not being formed into the full arch, but it is slowly being morphed into it.\nApart from the arch, in the Plavna section the river also carved a steep canyon, a typical for the &lt;a href=\"Tithonian\"&gt;Tithonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; region. The canyon is carved in the Deli Jovan's Kum massif. There are also two caves in this section: Dudi\u0107 Cave and Cvetko Cave. Paradise Arch is located at the end of the canyon. The arch is almost tall and wide. Above the arch is a natural lookout. In total, there are over 10 caves, including the still unexplored Medved caves. Dudi\u0107 Cave is long and rich in &lt;a href=\"speleothems\"&gt;speleothems&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the wider valley of the river, there are 23 discovered caves so far, including Vasiljev and Novakovi\u0107 caves. The well arranged hiking path leads to the Dudi\u0107 and Cvetko caves, though it is long and includes passing through water is some sections.\nAt the village of &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0tubik\"&gt;\u0160tubik&lt;/a&gt;, it turns in the northeast direction and receives the Miljakova\u010dka reka from the right and Turija from the left. Passing west of the village of &lt;a href=\"Malajnica\"&gt;Malajnica&lt;/a&gt; and east of the village of &lt;a href=\"Jabukovac%2C%20Negotin\"&gt;Jabukovac&lt;/a&gt;, it receives the Sko\u010dka river from the left. In lower section, the river meanders a lot, before it empties into the Danube at &lt;a href=\"Mihajlovac%20%28Negotin%29\"&gt;Mihajlovac&lt;/a&gt;, across the island of &lt;a href=\"Ostrovu%20Mare\"&gt;Ostrovu Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Jabukovac, there is a former riverbed of the Zamna. It is some long and abundant in fish.\nWildlife.\nLush forests consists of &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"common%20hornbeam\"&gt;common hornbeam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20oak\"&gt;Turkey oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ferns\"&gt;ferns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;. Arable land is mostly cultivated by the &lt;a href=\"corn\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe river is rich in fish, including &lt;a href=\"European%20chub\"&gt;European chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gobio%20gobio\"&gt;gudgeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"common%20barbel\"&gt;common barbel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crayfish\"&gt;Crayfish&lt;/a&gt; also dwell in Zamna.\nThe valley of Zamna is also abundant in snakes. It is a habitat for &lt;a href=\"grass%20snake\"&gt;grass snake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aesculapian%20snake\"&gt;Aesculapian snake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vipera%20ammodytes\"&gt;horned viper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20adder\"&gt;European adder&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the area is close to the protected area of &lt;a href=\"Vratna\"&gt;Vratna&lt;/a&gt;, deer and wild boars can be seen along the Zamna, too, so as the &lt;a href=\"birds%20of%20prey\"&gt;birds of prey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Free%20range\"&gt;Free range&lt;/a&gt; cattle farming is developed.\nHuman history.\n&lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Ancient Roman&lt;/a&gt; archaeological site &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0arkamen\"&gt;\u0160arkamen&lt;/a&gt; is in the vicinity of the river.\nIn 1807, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Serbian%20Uprising\"&gt;First Serbian Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, two battles were fought in the river's valley: and .\nFolklore.\nLocal folklore considers it a magical location, a place where fairies converge to seduce passersby with their magical dance. Local population uses the water from below the arch for magical rituals. It is believed that the water which flows over the stones is magically clear. Also, there are numerous tales of hidden &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20hajduk\"&gt;hajduks'&lt;/a&gt; treasure, so the gorge is dug through on several places. The inhabitants also believed that in the river lives the Water Spirit. Paradise Arch was specifically named that way, as the residents believe it is a place where souls directly enter heaven, and the locality where forces of good and multi-dimensional demons collide. Kanitz described people he met as very pious.\nWatermills.\nZamna was known for its watermills. Over a dozen of them existed on the river. They grinded the corn flower, from which the specific corn bread was baked, called \"malaj(ac)\". It gave name to the village of Malajnica next to which the river flows.\nProtection.\nThe canyon was protected for the first time in 1957. This decision was suppressed in June 2020 with the new one, when under the name of the \"Tunnel Cave Arch in Zamna Canyon\", the feature was protected as the &lt;a href=\"natural%20monument\"&gt;natural monument&lt;/a&gt;. Described as the \"speleological object of the tunnel cave type\", the area was placed in category I of protection because of the \"international, national and outstanding importance\", based on its \"authenticity, representativeness, landscape attractiveness and preservation\". Protected area covers on territories of two villages, \u0160tubik and Plavna. It is administered by the Tourist Organization of &lt;a href=\"Negotin\"&gt;Negotin&lt;/a&gt;."
