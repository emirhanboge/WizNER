The gate piers to the Manor House are Grade II listed and also date from 1673, although the wrought iron gates are 20th-century.\nThe village &lt;a href=\"public%20house\"&gt;public house&lt;/a&gt; is the 17th-century Royal Oak locally referred to as 'The Splash' due to the long ford that runs adjacent to the premises. Kenwick Park Golf Club lies to the north of the village."
