His older brother is football manager and former player &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Kova%C4%8D\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nKova\u010d started his career in lower league clubs Rapide Wedding and &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20Zehlendorf\"&gt;Hertha Zehlendorf&lt;/a&gt; before making his Bundesliga debut with &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;1. FC N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. Regularly featuring in the first\u2013eleven, Kova\u010d attracted much attention to himself and was signed at the end of the season by &lt;a href=\"Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;.\nBayer Leverkusen.\nHe spent the next five seasons in Leverkusen without any significant success, as the club did not win any trophy during that period, although they were three times &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; runners\u2013up.\nBayern Munich.\nAfter his contract expired he went to join reigning champions of &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt; season and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; title holders, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;.

He was one of the few first\u2013team players that decided to stay in Juve following its demotion to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;. He made a total of 35 appearances and scored one goal before he moved back to Germany, this time for &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorussia Dortmund.\nOn 1 August 2007, he signed for Borussia Dortmund, alongside another Croatian national team star, &lt;a href=\"Mladen%20Petri%C4%87\"&gt;Mladen Petri\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, who signed for the club two months earlier. Kova\u010d had an unsuccessful comeback to the Bundesliga and was sold to &lt;a href=\"Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; at the winter transfer window of 2008\u201309 season.\nDinamo Zagreb.\nOn 29 January 2009, close to the January transfer window deadline, he signed 1 and a half year contract with &lt;a href=\"Prva%20HNL\"&gt;Croatian champions&lt;/a&gt; Dinamo Zagreb.

At World Cup 2006 he played well in defence, however after picking up a second yellow against Japan he missed the final group match against Australia through suspension. Without Kova\u010d, Croatia struggled in defence with his replacement Tomas committing handball for Australia's first goal via penalty kick. Croatia eventually drew 2\u20132 with Australia but were eliminated from the tournament.
