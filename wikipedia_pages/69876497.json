    "text": "Freedom Convoy 2022 () is an ongoing &lt;a href=\"Protests%20over%20responses%20to%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; conducted by truck drivers in Canada against &lt;a href=\"Vaccine%20passports%20during%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%23Canada\"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine requirements to re-enter the country by land&lt;/a&gt; introduced by the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Government of Canada&lt;/a&gt; on January 15, 2022. Composed of several routes traversing all of the Canadian &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;, the truck convoys converged on &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; on January 29, 2022, with a &lt;a href=\"Political%20demonstration\"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20Hill\"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The protest continued into January 30, 31 and February 1.\nFundraising was organized by Tamara Lich, the secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Maverick%20Party\"&gt;Maverick Party&lt;/a&gt;, a Western Canadian &lt;a href=\"Separatism\"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt; party. Some protesters have also expressed opposition to Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Trudeau\"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;. Trudeau and his family were evacuated from their home in the capital amid the protests.\nPrior to January 15, 2022, truck drivers and other essential workers had been exempt from the two-week quarantine for unvaccinated travellers crossing Canada's borders. The exemption's abolition has been criticized by some politicians and truckers for having the potential to exacerbate the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%932022%20global%20supply%20chain%20crisis\"&gt;supply chain disruptions&lt;/a&gt; already experienced in Canada. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; also has a vaccine requirement for non-US individuals which began on January 22, 2022. As of January 22, when the United States' mandate came into effect, these mandates would impact 26,000 of the 160,000 drivers in both the United States and Canada who regularly cross the border.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Trucking%20Alliance\"&gt;Canadian Trucking Alliance&lt;/a&gt; estimates that 85% of the 120,000 Canadian truck drivers are already vaccinated against COVID-19. A January 29 CTA statement cautioned the public that a \"great number of protestors\" with no connection to the trucking industry \"have a separate agenda beyond a disagreement over cross border vaccine requirements.\" \nWhile several &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; and right-wing politicians supported the protest, the convoy has been condemned by trucking industry groups. On January 27, Trudeau said that almost 90% of Canadians were vaccinated, as were many truckers in Canada, and that a \"small fringe minority of people\" in the convoy do not \"represent the views of Canadians.\" &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Alghabra\"&gt;Omar Alghabra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Transport%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Minister of Transport&lt;/a&gt; also denounced those carrying signs with swastikas and Confederate flags, and those who \"called for the overthrow of the government.\" Alghabra said that by January 29, based on recent Statistics Canada data, there were no indications that the implementation of the vaccine mandate had decreased cross-border truck volume. Illegal acts committed by protesters drew widespread condemnation and prompted police to launch criminal investigations. A statue of national hero &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Fox\"&gt;Terry Fox&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20War%20Memorial%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;/a&gt; were desecrated during the rally, prompting statements from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Legion\"&gt;Royal Canadian Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Fox%20Foundation\"&gt;Terry Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, defence minister &lt;a href=\"Anita%20Anand\"&gt;Anita Anand&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nBackground and goals.\nThe protest calls for the end of &lt;a href=\"Vaccine%20passports%20during%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; in Canada during the ongoing &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Freedom Convoy's spokesperson Ben Dichter stated on Fox News that \"We want to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the (vaccine) passports. And that passport, that's the really concerning one\".\nOn November 19, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Health%20Agency%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/a&gt; announced upcoming adjustments to Canada's border measures. Included in the announced adjustments was the requirement for essential service providers, including truck drivers, to be fully vaccinated after January 15, 2022. When asked in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; to produce data linking truckers to COVID-19 infections in Canada, neither the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Health%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;minister of health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jean-Yves%20Duclos\"&gt;Jean-Yves Duclos&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20of%20Canada\"&gt;chief public health officer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theresa%20Tam\"&gt;Theresa Tam&lt;/a&gt; were able to do so. As well, the announced adjustments clarified that unvaccinated or partially vaccinated foreign national truck drivers would be prohibited from entering Canada after that date. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security\"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; (DHS) previously announced on October 29, 2021, that proof of vaccination would be required to enter the United States starting in January 2022. On January 22, 2022, like Canada, the DHS implemented proof of vaccination requirements for all non-US individuals entering the country by land and ferry. According to the Canadian Press and CBC, as of January 22, the mandates would impact 26,000 of the 160,000 truck drivers in both the United States and Canada who regularly cross the border.\nOne of the groups associated with the protest, \"Canada Unity\", put out a memo on January 25, 2022, calling all levels of government cease all vaccine mandates, reemploy all employees terminated due to vaccination status and rescind all fines imposed for non-compliance with public health orders. \nAs the convoy reached Ontario, it began to expand from its original goals. Several protesters voiced opposition to perceived authoritarianism and corruption by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Trudeau\"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, stating they wanted him \"out of office\", while others said: \"This is not an anti-vaccination movement, this is a freedom movement\". Jason LaFace, Canada Unity's Ontario organizer for the convoy, has stated that the intent of the protest is to dissolve the government. They plan to present the memo to &lt;a href=\"Governor%20General%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Governor General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Simon\"&gt;Mary Simon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"First%20Nations%20in%20Canada\"&gt;First Nations&lt;/a&gt; members were also seen among the protesters, carrying \"every child matters\" flags, which are used to express anger at the coverup of deaths in residential schools.\nProtest timeline.\nConvoy movements.\nThe first convoy departed &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Prince Rupert&lt;/a&gt; on January 22, arriving in &lt;a href=\"Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Prince George&lt;/a&gt; in the evening. The following day, another convoy left from &lt;a href=\"Delta%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt; with supporters gathering along &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia%20Highway%201\"&gt;Highway 1&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn January 24, a convoy drove through &lt;a href=\"Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;Regina, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; and was greeted by supporters. According to &lt;a href=\"Regina%20Police%20Service\"&gt;police in Regina&lt;/a&gt;, about 1,200 vehicles reached the city. On January 25, another convoy passed through &lt;a href=\"Kenora\"&gt;Kenora&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario, where &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Provincial%20Police\"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt; (OPP) in contact with the convoy stated that 200\u2013300 vehicles would be passing through Kenora. The convoys consist of three main routes across Canada, which will converge for the Ottawa protest on the weekend. The &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20Police%20Service\"&gt;Ottawa Police Service&lt;/a&gt; estimated up to 2,000 demonstrators in the city on the weekend. \nAs of January 26, the OPP estimated approximately 400 vehicles had entered Ontario from the Manitoba border as part of the eastbound convoy. The &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20Police\"&gt;Kingston Police&lt;/a&gt; estimated approximately 300 vehicles (17 full tractor-trailers, 104 tractors without trailers, 424 passenger vehicles and six RVs) to go through Kingston.\nOn January 27, winter weather closed a portion of &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Highway%2017\"&gt;Highway 17&lt;/a&gt;, (the main route of the Trans-Canada) in northern Ontario, causing the eastbound convoy to be divided. Some of the truckers continued on to &lt;a href=\"Sault%20Ste.%20Marie\"&gt;Sault Ste. Marie&lt;/a&gt;, while others diverted to &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Highway%2011\"&gt;Highway 11&lt;/a&gt; (a northern branch of the TCH) and drove towards &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTruckers from the &lt;a href=\"Maritimes\"&gt;Maritime provinces&lt;/a&gt; planned to meet in &lt;a href=\"Moncton\"&gt;Moncton&lt;/a&gt; before departing for Ottawa. On the morning of January 27, supporters gathered in &lt;a href=\"Enfield%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Enfield, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; where fireworks were set off as 10 to 15 trucks departed for the New Brunswick border. &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police\"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; in PEI reported that approximately 70 trucks and supporters' vehicles crossed the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20Bridge\"&gt;Confederation Bridge&lt;/a&gt; into New Brunswick, but that most immediately turned around and returned to the island. About 24 trucks reportedly passed through &lt;a href=\"Fredericton\"&gt;Fredericton&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon, bound for Ottawa. On January 27, one convoy group passed through the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Toronto%20Area\"&gt;Greater Toronto Area&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of protesters gathered at highway overpasses in support of the convoy.\nOn January 27, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McDonell\"&gt;Patrick McDonell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Sergeants-at-Arms%20of%20the%20Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, sent a letter warning of possible &lt;a href=\"doxing\"&gt;doxing&lt;/a&gt; attempts to discover the addresses of Members of Parliament in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Region%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Capital Region&lt;/a&gt;. The letter further warned MPs not to get involved in any demonstrations, to \"go somewhere safe\", and to keep all doors locked. The OPP tweeted \"OPP advises motorists to avoid travel on &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Highway%20417\"&gt;Hwy 417&lt;/a&gt; (the TCH in eastern Ontario) and &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Highway%20416\"&gt;Hwy 416&lt;/a&gt; in the Ottawa area, beginning Friday afternoon and on Saturday.\" \nOn January 28, a convoy was seen passing through &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. About 600 convoy vehicles are expected to stay the night in &lt;a href=\"Arnprior\"&gt;Arnprior&lt;/a&gt; before heading to &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20Hill\"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt; the following morning.\nMembers of the protest use &lt;a href=\"Zello\"&gt;Zello&lt;/a&gt; chat to communicate. \nProvincial response.\nOn January 28, the province of &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; banned gatherings along highways, specifically on the Trans-Canada (&lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia%20Highway%20104\"&gt;Highway 104&lt;/a&gt;) between the Nova Scotia and &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick\"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; border, in relation to protests related to the freedom convoy.\nOttawa.\nOn January 28, as the first trucks began to arrive in the city, the &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20Police%20Service\"&gt;Ottawa Police Service&lt;/a&gt; disclosed that it had called in reinforcements from the RCMP and the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;Canadian Security Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; (CSIS), and were working to identify threats in the convoy. Police Chief &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sloly\"&gt;Peter Sloly&lt;/a&gt; advised people to avoid downtown Ottawa during the weekend protest, adding that \"we are prepared to investigate, arrest if necessary, charge and prosecute anyone who acts violently or breaks the law in the demonstrations, or in association with the demonstrations\".\nOn January 29, the first day of protest at &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20Hill\"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Trudeau\"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; was moved to an undisclosed location due to security concerns.\nVarious images of specific acts during the day received wide condemnation. Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"National%20War%20Memorial%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Eyre\"&gt;Wayne Eyre&lt;/a&gt; described it as a desecration, and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Legion\"&gt;Royal Canadian Legion&lt;/a&gt; condemned the actions. A statue of iconic cancer fundraiser &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Fox\"&gt;Terry Fox&lt;/a&gt; was decorated with an upside-down Canadian flag and a protest sign. The &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Fox%20Foundation\"&gt;Terry Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt; commented that Fox \"believed in science and gave his life to help others\". Images of a Canadian flag marked with a &lt;a href=\"swastika\"&gt;swastika&lt;/a&gt; were seen, as were two &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20flag\"&gt;Confederate flags&lt;/a&gt;. The man with the Confederate flag was later forced out by other protesters, who said \u201cNow he's going. Now he's gone. We called him out. He knows. He's gonna hold his head in shame now\u201d Some protesters harassed volunteers at a local &lt;a href=\"soup%20kitchen\"&gt;soup kitchen&lt;/a&gt; demanding free food intended for Ottawa's homeless population. According to soup kitchen staff, \"One member of our shelter community was assaulted by protesters. A security guard went to his aid and was threatened and called &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ethnic%20slurs\"&gt;racial slurs&lt;/a&gt;.\" The soup kitchen also said that protesters' vehicles blocked the kitchen's ambulance drop-off zone for around 12 hours before they were towed. A video circulated showing protesters appropriating &lt;a href=\"First%20Nations%20in%20Canada\"&gt;First Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drum\"&gt;drumming&lt;/a&gt; while dancing, drinking &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;, and chanting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flintstones\"&gt;yaba daba doo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"fuck Trudeau.\" Senator and &lt;a href=\"Mi%27kmaq\"&gt;Mi'kmaq&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Francis%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Brian Francis&lt;/a&gt; tweeted \"I am disgusted, appalled and saddened. This blatant act of racism must be vehemently condemned by all. Drumming is sacred to all First Nations. Our ways of life should never be mimicked, mocked and appropriated for political or other gain.\"\nOn January 29, the atmosphere was party-like and among the protesters were parents with kids, groups of friends, and elderly people. They were waving flags, playing music and honking horns. Ottawa Police reported de-escalating multiple \"high-risk situations\" making no arrests.\nOn January 30, Ottawa Police launched a criminal investigation into the desecration of the National War Memorial and statue of Terry Fox. They will also be investigating \"threatening/illegal/intimidating behaviour\" toward police officers, workers and other private citizens. Also on January 30, Sloly said that \"I think the only thing we can say for sure we're still going to be dealing with some level of traffic disruption and demonstration over the next 24 hours.\"\nHenry Hildebrandt, a pastor from &lt;a href=\"Aylmer%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Aylmer, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, known for repeated openings of the church during pandemic restrictions, held a sermon outside the Prime Minister's office, suggesting the crowd would \"come and knock at [Trudeau's] door\", if he didn't heed \"the word of God\". A press conference was held at an undisclosed location, open only to invited right-wing outlets.\nThe House of Commons resumed on January 31, after the holiday break.\nOn January 31, Ottawa Paramedics announced that protesters had thrown rocks at an ambulance over the course of the weekend and called paramedics racial slurs. Paramedics had treated 19 people over the course of the weekend, mostly due to alcohol-related intoxication.\nOn the afternoon of January 31, Sloly said that \"The situation of the demonstration has scaled down over the last 12 hours\" and that \"We want that trend to continue until this demonstration comes to a complete end. I cannot guarantee you that right now but I can guarantee that every effort at negotiation, coordination, de-escalation, has continued throughout the last four days and will continue until the complete end of this demonstration.\"\nOn February 1, large downtown Ottawa amenities like &lt;a href=\"Rideau%20Centre\"&gt;Rideau Centre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;National Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt; continued to stay closed due to security concerns. Ottawa police set up a hotline for hate-motivated crimes to be reported.\nFundraising.\nMore than CA$7.5 million has been raised as of January 28, out of the CA$7 million goal, mostly through \"small donations of $50 or $100\". Some donors were anonymous and some were from outside Canada. Jodhveer Singh Dhaliwal, &lt;a href=\"New%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Jagmeet%20Singh\"&gt;Jagmeet Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s brother-in-law, was one of the largest donors to the campaign. He claimed he was unaware what the money would be used for, and claims to have sought a refund.\nFundraising started on January 14, 2022, through the crowdsource fundraising platform &lt;a href=\"GoFundMe\"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;. The Taking Back Our Freedom Convoy 2022 GoFundMe quickly raised over CA$5 million by January 25, 2022. On January 24, 2022, GoFundMe responded to questions by &lt;a href=\"CTV%20News\"&gt;CTV News&lt;/a&gt; stating funds raised would not be distributed until the fundraising organizers could demonstrate how the funds would be properly distributed. On January 27, GoFundMe released the initial CA$1 million of the funds after the organizers have provided a distribution plan.\nOrganizers of the fundraising include B. J. Dichter, a 2015 federal Conservative candidate, now associated with the People's Party of Canada.\nMisinformation.\nIn a Facebook post on January 26, some organizers estimated as many as 50,000 trucks would be participating in the convoys, a statement repeated in the Toronto Sun and on Fox News. On his blog, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; commentator &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Hannity\"&gt;Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; reported that the convoy was made up of 10,000 heavy trucks, and &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Sun\"&gt;Toronto Sun&lt;/a&gt; editor-in-chief Joe Warmington reported that the event may set a &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt; for the largest truck convoy on record. &lt;a href=\"Snopes\"&gt;Snopes&lt;/a&gt; described the claims as a \"gross exaggeration\", suggesting the total count was \"likely hundreds\", and pointing out that the convoy includes many cars and smaller vehicles. &lt;a href=\"Agence%20France-Presse\"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; also fact-checked the claims as false: the current record is 480 trucks, set in &lt;a href=\"Cairo%2C%20Egypt\"&gt;Cairo, Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020, and the Freedom Convoy did not submit an application for an attempt at setting a new record.\nOn January 29, 2022, the Canadian Trucking Alliance commented that many of the supporters at the protest in Ottawa had no direct connection to the trucking industry.\nAlleged links to extremist groups.\nIn the lead-up to the planned arrival in Ottawa, it was anonymously reported on January 25 that alleged &lt;a href=\"Far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20supremacy\"&gt;white-supremacist&lt;/a&gt; groups were hoping for violence on Parliament Hill and redress of grievances akin to the &lt;a href=\"2021%20United%20States%20Capitol%20attack\"&gt;2021 United States Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt;. This has caused organizer Tamara Lich to address convoy members and denounce political violence, saying that protesters should \"hold a peaceful protest\" instead. Organizers and leaders of the convoy condemned extremist groups, and asked that participants report law breakers to the police. They also stated that any extremists found would be \"removed\" from the convoy. Despite this, some protesters were photographed waving Confederate or &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi flags&lt;/a&gt; at the rally. One man who was carrying a confederate flag was heckled and forced to leave by other protesters, who said \u201cNow he's going. Now he's gone. We called him out. He knows. He's gonna hold his head in shame now.\u201d On January 28, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Trudeau\"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern that a small group of protesters are going to be posing a threat during the weekend. \nStatements and reactions.\nCanadian politicians.\nOpposition.\n&lt;a href=\"Justin%20Trudeau\"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, dismissed the supply chain disruption concerns as unfounded on the basis that most Canadian truckers have been vaccinated. On January 31, Trudeau called the protests an \"insult to truth\", saying that \"we are not intimated by those who hurl abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless\" and \"We won\u2019t give in to those who fly racist flags. We won\u2019t cave to those who engage in vandalism, or dishonour the memory of our veterans.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Omar%20Alghabra\"&gt;Omar Alghabra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Transport%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Minister of Transport&lt;/a&gt;, said on January 31, that since January 15 when the truck drivers' vaccine mandate came into effect, the traffic volumes of transport trucks crossing the Canada-U.S. border had not decreased. Compared to the fall of 2021, and based on &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20Canada\"&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s most recent figures, even with a \"massive snowstorm, even though it was a U.S. holiday, we had almost 100,000 truckers cross the border\". On CTV's January 30 Question Period he said that some voices in the crowd of protestors are \"really disturbing and unacceptable\" and \"must be condemned\"; this included those carrying signs with swastikas and Confederate flags, and those who \"called for the overthrow of the government.\" On January 24, he described them as a \"the small number of far-right, vocal opposition that is polluting\" the debate surrounding vaccine mandates. Other Canadian politicians\u2014including &lt;a href=\"Jagmeet%20Singh\"&gt;Jagmeet Singh&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20City%20Council\"&gt;Ottawa City Councillor&lt;/a&gt; Katherine McKenney\u2014described the protests as extremist. Mayor of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Coquitlam\"&gt;Port Coquitlam&lt;/a&gt; Brad West condemned the defacing of Fox's statue during the protest.\n&lt;a href=\"Erin%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Erin O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Official%20Opposition%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Leader of the Official Opposition&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, initially declined to support the protest, saying instead that the best way to maintain supply chains is for truckers to get vaccinated. O'Toole then later said he would meet with the protesters, but would not participate in nor attend their demonstration in Ottawa. O-Toole tweeted \"I support their right to be heard, and I call on Justin Trudeau to meet with these hard-working Canadians to hear their concerns\". O'Toole, a veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, later condemned the protesters for \"desecrating\" the war memorials on Parliament Hill.\nSupport.\nConservative MPs &lt;a href=\"Candice%20Bergen%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Candice Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Poilievre\"&gt;Pierre Poilievre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Scheer\"&gt;Andrew Scheer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garnett%20Genuis\"&gt;Garnett Genuis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Shields\"&gt;Martin Shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Steinley\"&gt;Warren Steinley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Patzer\"&gt;Jeremy Patzer&lt;/a&gt; all expressed their support for the convoy and truckers' movement. &lt;a href=\"Damien%20Kurek\"&gt;Damien Kurek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Cooper%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Michael Cooper&lt;/a&gt; attended the rally, serving food. Cooper was further interviewed on television. A person in behind Cooper had an upside-down Canadian flag with a &lt;a href=\"swastika\"&gt;swastika&lt;/a&gt;; Cooper says that he was unaware.\nThe &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;People's Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; organized a rally in &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; on January 23 in support of the convoy protests. Leader &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Bernier\"&gt;Maxime Bernier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"independent%20politician\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; Ontario MPP &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Hillier\"&gt;Randy Hillier&lt;/a&gt; spoke at the event. Bernier also attended the January 29 event at Parliament Hill, criticizing Erin O'Toole for not attending.\nOn January 29, &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Moe\"&gt;Scott Moe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;Premier of Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, issued a letter in support of the protest. Although repeatedly encouraging vaccination, Moe stated that he did not support the cross-border vaccine mandate because vaccination does not prevent being infected by or transmitting COVID-19 (a statement that was subsequently disputed by multiple provincial doctors), and pledged that he would lift proof of vaccination requirements in Saskatchewan \"in the not too-distant future\" for that reason.\nInternational politicians.\nVarious conservative American politicians endorsed the Freedom Convoy including &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. Representatives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Banks\"&gt;Jim Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Jordan%20%28American%20politician%29\"&gt;Jim Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20McCarthy%20%28California%20politician%29\"&gt;Kevin McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff\"&gt;White House Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Meadows\"&gt;Mark Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump%20Jr.\"&gt;Donald Trump Jr.&lt;/a&gt;\nOrganizations.\nOn January 25, the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Trucking%20Alliance\"&gt;Canadian Trucking Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (CTA), a truckers' &lt;a href=\"trade%20association\"&gt;trade association&lt;/a&gt; and the federal government issued a formal statement reinforcing the use of vaccinations, along with other public health measures, to protect Canadian health care and to reduce Covid-19 risk. In the statement the CTA and the governemen committed to working together to respond supply chain constraints. A January 29 CTA statement cautioned the public that a \"great number of protestors\" have no connection to the trucking industry and \"have a separate agenda beyond a disagreement over cross border vaccine requirements\". CTA's January 22 statement had announced that they do \"not support support and strongly disapprove of any protests on public roadways, highways, and bridges\" and the disruption of the \"motoring public on highways and commerce at the border\". CTA members can express their disagreement with government policies by holding an \"organized, lawful event on Parliament Hill.\" Stephen Laskowski, CTA president said the trucking industry \"must adapt and comply with this mandate.\" \nThe Private Motor Truck Council of Canada noted concern about the convoy's \"racist remarks\", citing the comparisons to &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt;. The Atlantic Provinces Trucking Association and the British Columbia Trucking Association both criticized the protest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Fox%20Foundation\"&gt;Terry Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt; also condemned the defacing of Fox's statue with anti-mandate signs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Legion\"&gt;Royal Canadian Legion&lt;/a&gt; called protesters dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier \"shocking\" and \"strongly condemn[ed]\" their actions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center\"&gt;Simon Wiesenthal Center&lt;/a&gt; for Holocaust Studies denounced the use of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20symbolism\"&gt;Nazi symbols&lt;/a&gt; by some of the protesters.\nOthers.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Eyre\"&gt;Wayne Eyre&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Chief of the Defence Staff&lt;/a&gt;, said he was, \"sickened to see protesters dance on the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&lt;/a&gt; and desecrate the &lt;a href=\"National%20War%20Memorial%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;\", after video of such events surfaced online January 29.\nBarry Prentice, transportation economy professor at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;University of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the truckers should be treated differently than flight crews or passenger-train employees, and that the positive aspects of vaccine mandates should be evaluated against the disruptions they would cause to the freight industry. &lt;a href=\"Elon%20Musk\"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; tweeted \"Canadian truckers rule\" and followed it up with \"If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom. This is the path to tyranny.\" English comedian &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Brand\"&gt;Russell Brand&lt;/a&gt; released a video decrying the media for ignoring reporting on the protest. Brand also said in the video that \"Truckers, who were previously regarded as heroes when they were delivering vital goods and working during the lockdown, are now villains as they protest vaccine mandates\". &lt;a href=\"Krista%20Haynes\"&gt;Krista Haynes&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Ontario Premier &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Ford\"&gt;Doug Ford&lt;/a&gt; and active anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine campaigner, attended a rally in support of the truckers as they headed to Ottawa."
