    "text": "USRC \"Levi Woodbury\" was a &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;screw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"revenue%20cutter\"&gt;revenue cutter&lt;/a&gt; built for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service\"&gt;United States Revenue Cutter Service&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Built in 1863\u201364, she became one of the longest-serving revenue cutters in the Service's history, and was the oldest active-duty ship in U.S. government service by the end of her 51-year career.\nOriginally named Mahoning, the ship spent almost her entire career operating off the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, where through the course of several decades she accumulated an outstanding record for aiding ships in distress. Other highlights of her career included the foiling of a &lt;a href=\"filibuster%20%28military%29\"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; raid on &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; in 1869, and participation in the funeral pageant of renowned philanthropist &lt;a href=\"George%20Peabody\"&gt;George Peabody&lt;/a&gt;. She also briefly served as USS \"Woodbury\" in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter her final decommission in 1915, \"Levi Woodbury\" was placed into service as the merchant Laksco. She disappears from shipping records in 1932.\nConstruction and design.\n\"Levi Woodbury\"\u2014originally named \"Mahoning\" after &lt;a href=\"Mahoning%20Creek%20%28Allegheny%20River%29\"&gt;a creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mahoning%20Valley\"&gt;a valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was one of six \"Pawtuxet\"-class screw &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt;s ordered by the Treasury Department in 1863 for the United States Revenue Marine. \"Mahoning\" was built in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; by J. W. Lynn. Among those aboard for the launch, on the afternoon of Wednesday, 29 July 1863, were \"a number of ladies, many officers of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Philadelphia Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;, and other invited guests.\" \"Mahoning\" was christened by Miss Rebecca B. Thomas, daughter of Philadelphia's Collector of Ports, Colonel W. B. Thomas.\n\"Mahoning\" was long, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and both &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; and hold depth of . Like the other ships of her class, her contract called for a &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20locust\"&gt;locust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"white%20oak\"&gt;white oak&lt;/a&gt;, strengthened with diagonal iron bracing. Her two-&lt;a href=\"cylinder%20%28engine%29\"&gt;cylinder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"marine%20steam%20engine%23Oscillating\"&gt;oscillating&lt;/a&gt; engine drove a single 8-foot (2.4 m) diameter &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mahoning\"s speed is unrecorded but was probably similar to the 12 knots achieved by her sister ship &lt;a href=\"USRC%20Kankakee\"&gt;USRC \"Kankakee\"&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"topsail%20schooner\"&gt;topsail schooner&lt;/a&gt;-rigged for auxiliary sail power.\n\"Mahoning\"s armament consisted of a single 30-pounder &lt;a href=\"Parrott%20rifle\"&gt;Parrott rifle&lt;/a&gt; and five 24-pounder howitzers. She was crewed by a complement of seven officers and 34 enlisted men.\nService history.\nCivil War service, 1864\u201365.\n\"Mahoning\" was commissioned into the Revenue Marine on 18 July 1864. Among her first duties was the transport of a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20congressional%20committee\"&gt;Congressional Committee&lt;/a&gt; in mid-August to &lt;a href=\"Wiscasset%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Wiscasset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Popham\"&gt;Fort Popham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Bath, Maine&lt;/a&gt;. On 29 September, \"Mahoning\" arrived in &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, on the same day as her sister ship &lt;a href=\"USRC%20Pawtuxet\"&gt;\"Pawtuxet\"&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, and a comparative trial between the two vessels announced.\nOn 16 November, while attempting to enter the port of &lt;a href=\"Castine%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Castine, Maine&lt;/a&gt; during a gale, \"Mahoning\" was mistakenly fired upon by Battery White, which apparently mistook her for a &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mahoning\"s Captain Webster reported that the Battery fired three rounds in total, at a range of : \"one blank cartridge and two excellent line shots [that] fell short\". This reception persuaded the vessel to make for &lt;a href=\"Seal%20Harbor%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Seal Harbor&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nAwards, 1866\u201367.\nA year later, at Portland in November 1866, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt; presented Captain Webster, commander of \"Mahoning\", with \"a fine gold chronometer and chain, in token of his services to British seamen in distress during last Winter.\" In May 1867, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; passed a resolution authorizing Captain Webster to receive a gold medal from Sir Frederick Bruck for aiding British vessels in distress.\nFoiled filibuster raid, 1869.\nIn July 1869, \"Mahoning\" participated in the foiling of a planned &lt;a href=\"filibuster%20%28military%29\"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; raid on &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; by \"a motley collection of ex-officers and fanatics\" known as the Cuban Liberators, who had gathered on &lt;a href=\"Gardiners%20Island\"&gt;Gardiners Island&lt;/a&gt;, New York, in preparation for their attack. \"Mahoning\", still under the command of Captain Webster, initially approached the island with a force of 12 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;marines&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly realized this force was inadequate, and an additional party of 38 marines sent for, which arrived aboard the tugboat \"Rocket\". After locating the filibusters' camp and firing a few warning shots, the marines were able to capture most of them without incident. The captives, in a \"dirty and disorganized condition\" and numbering 125 in total, were then transported aboard the revenue cutter to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lafayette\"&gt;Fort Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;, where they were held pending further orders from &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeabody funeral pageant and other events, 1870\u201373.\nOn Saturday 29 January 1870, \"Mahoning\" participated in ceremonies occasioned by the return from the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of the remains of noted &lt;a href=\"philanthropy\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Peabody\"&gt;George Peabody&lt;/a&gt; at Portland Harbor, Maine. The ceremonies began at 10:15 am when \"Mahoning\" conveyed members of the U.S. Legislature to , where they conducted an inspection of the ship and viewed Peabody's casket. The legislators then returned to \"Mahoning\" to be given a sightseeing tour of the assembled fleet from \"Mahoning\"s deck. \"Mahoning\" later joined the fleet as it formed a procession to escort Peabody's casket to shore.\n\"Mahoning\" participated in a second ceremonial passage on Tuesday, 5 August 1872, when she escorted out of the harbor a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese diplomatic mission departing &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; on the \"Olympus\". On 5 June 1873, \"Mahoning\" was renamed \"Levi Woodbury\" in honor of &lt;a href=\"Levi%20Woodbury\"&gt;the Supreme Court Justice&lt;/a&gt; of the same name.\nCable ship welcome, 1874.\nIn early June 1874, \"Levi Woodbury\" was despatched from Boston to try to locate the SS \"Faraday\", a cable-laying ship from Britain whose appearance at Boston was behind schedule. \"Levi Woodbury\" departed Boston with a large party of about 150, including the Mayor, several ex-Mayors and other dignitaries. Thick fog however frustrated the expedition, and \"Levi Woodbury\" was obliged to return in the afternoon.\nOn 8 June \"Faraday\" was finally located off &lt;a href=\"White%20Island%20Shores%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;White Island&lt;/a&gt;, where she had anchored due to thick fog, and \"Levi Woodbury\" despatched to greet the vessel. The party from \"Levi Woodbury\" were warmly greeted aboard \"Faraday\" and treated to a \"sumptuous lunch\", after which various toasts were made celebrating the prospect of a new cable link between the two countries. A formal reception at Portland was organized the following day for \"Faraday\"s officers and electricians, to which the officers of \"Levi Woodbury\" were also invited.\nIn December, \"Levi Woodbury\" was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Eastport%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Eastport, Maine&lt;/a&gt; to take the place of revenue cutter \"Mosswood\", which had been ordered to New York.\nWinter patrols, 1870s\u20131890s.\nOver her many years of operation from &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; ports, \"Levi Woodbury\" was regularly selected for the arduous duty of winter patrolling. The purpose of these patrols, which were carried out from 1 December to 1 April each year, was to cruise off \"dangerous points\" of the coastline in search of ships in distress and render them appropriate assistance:\nMany a poor mariner, with his sails blown away, ground tackle gone, leaking badly, heavily iced up, food lockers empty, or perhaps out of his reckoning, sights the revenue cutter in the distance bearing down upon him, and experiences feelings which a landsman cannot understand.\nThese patrols, authorized directly by the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt;, were made \"as close to the land as the safety of the vessel will permit\", and were as extended as possible, weather, supplies and emergencies allowing.\nPreparation for the patrols began in November, with all the ship's equipment, including masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing hawsers and heaving lines would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18\u00a0inches above and below the waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.\nThe extent of \"Levi Woodbury\"s contribution to maritime safety over this period can be gauged by the fact that she was one of only two cutters assigned to patrol the Maine coastline, and that these waters, with their \"immense number of shoals, rocks, reefs and islands\", combined with the \"very strong tides, high winds, fog, vapor and ice\" typically accounted for about four fifths of the total number of ships aided by the Revenue Cutter Service each year. For example, in 1888, of the 526 ships in distress aided by the Service during the year, 400 were assisted by the two Maine cutters. \"Levi Woodbury\" had already accumulated a \"remarkable\" record of assistance by 1883; by 1892, it was being said of her that she had \"battled with more ice\"\u2014and by extension, assisted more ships in distress\u2014than any other steamer on the Eastern seaboard.\nSpanish\u2013American War, 1898.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon, \"Levi Woodbury\" was ordered to join the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s North Atlantic Fleet on 24 March. Two days later, she received orders to report to &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, arriving there 2 April. She subsequently participated in operations with the North Atlantic Fleet from 8 May to the end of hostilities in August, during which time she was referred to simply as \"Woodbury\" in naval records.\nThough \"Woodbury\" may have participated in troop convoys to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, her primary duty in this period consisted of blockading the port of &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. She took no prizes during her brief naval career and appears to have been involved in no engagements. Control of the cutter was returned to the Treasury Department on 17 August 1898. She seems to have retained the name \"Woodbury\" in Revenue Service records following the transfer.\nLater service.\nAfter the war, \"Woodbury\" returned to her former base at Portland, Maine, on 16 November to resume patrols of the New England coast. That routine occupied her for the next 17 years. On 18 July, 1904 she was involved in a minor collision with in the harbor at &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland, Maine&lt;/a&gt; due to excessive speed in dense fog by the cutter resulting in 1,200 in damage to the steamer. By 1912, her armament had been upgraded to a single rapid-fire 3-pounder. She also carried a 250 watt radio.\nBy 1913, \"Woodbury\" was not only the Coast Guard's oldest cutter, she was the oldest active-duty vessel in U.S. government service, as well as being the only ship to have seen active service in both the American Civil War and the Spanish\u2013American War. Despite her age, she was still able to perform useful service. On 10 January 1913, for example, the crew of \"Woodbury\" were able to effect temporary repairs to their ship's broken rudder to go to the aid of the steamer \"Monhegan\", which, after breaking down on the Maine coast, was being driven to destruction by a gale. \"Woodbury\" was able to get a line to the stricken vessel and tow it to safety, albeit at the stately pace of 3 knots.\nIn spite of such admirable efforts, however, \"Woodbury\" was clearly an obsolete ship, and in barely serviceable condition due to rotting timbers and worn out boilers. In 1913, the Revenue Cutter Service succeeded in its request to Congress for a replacement vessel, which was slated to enter service in 1915.\n\"Woodbury\" achieved one of her last triumphs when on 7 August 1914, \"in one of the most important ... [rescue] incidents of the year\", she towed to safety the steamer \"Bay State\", which, with 250 passengers and a crew of 104, had run aground \"in a very exposed position\" at &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Head%20Light\"&gt;Portland Head&lt;/a&gt;. A little under a year later, on 19 July 1915, \"Woodbury\" was placed out of commission, a few months after the creation of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and a few days before the commission of her $225,000 replacement . \"Woodbury\"s decommission ended a remarkable 51 years with the Revenue Cutter Service, making her one of the longest serving cutters in the organization's history.\n\"Levi Woodbury\" was sold on 10 August to Thomas Butler &amp; Co., of Boston, Massachusetts, and later entered service as the merchant \"Laksco\". She disappears from shipping records in 1932."
