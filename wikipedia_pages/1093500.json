    "text": "Taieri Mouth is a small &lt;a href=\"fishing%20village\"&gt;fishing village&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"river%20mouth\"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Taieri%20River\"&gt;Taieri River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Taieri%20Island\"&gt;Taieri Island&lt;/a&gt; (Moturata) lies in the ocean several hundred metres off the river's mouth.\nIt has a white &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; beach for &lt;a href=\"human%20swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"picnic\"&gt;picnic&lt;/a&gt; areas. Moturata is a distinctive landmark which can be walked to at low-tide. Caution is advised as the tides can change quickly. Another feature is the millennium &lt;a href=\"walking\"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; track that follows the Taieri River from the mouth through the lower &lt;a href=\"gorge\"&gt;gorge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Henley%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Henley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe village is located 40\u00a0km southwest of central &lt;a href=\"Dunedin\"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Scenic%20Route\"&gt;Southern Scenic Route&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Clutha%20District\"&gt;Clutha District&lt;/a&gt; on the boundary of Dunedin City and 10\u00a0km east of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Waihola\"&gt;Lake Waihola&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately to its south is the smaller settlement of Taieri Beach, and the two are often considered parts of the same settlement.\nIt gained a little notoriety or sadness in the 1990s as the place where the father of murder suspect &lt;a href=\"David%20Bain\"&gt;David Bain&lt;/a&gt; worked.\nHistory.\nThere was a &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; occupation site at Taieri Mouth, with &lt;a href=\"moa\"&gt;moa&lt;/a&gt; bones, indicating it was from the Moa Hunter (Archaic) period of M\u0101ori culture.\nAccording to oral tradition in the early 18th century Tuwiriroa moved from &lt;a href=\"Tititea\"&gt;Tititea&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Kawarau%20River\"&gt;Kawarau River&lt;/a&gt; near modern &lt;a href=\"Queenstown%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Queenstown&lt;/a&gt; and built a &lt;a href=\"pa%20%28fortified%20settlement%29\"&gt;pa&lt;/a&gt;, Motupara, near Taieri Mouth. A rival, Tukiauau, had already built a pa, Whakaraupuka, inland on the &lt;a href=\"Taieri%20Plain\"&gt;Taieri Plain&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Waihola\"&gt;Lake Waihola&lt;/a&gt;. Tuwiriroa had a daughter Haki Te Kura, famous for swimming across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wakatipu\"&gt;Lake Wakatipu&lt;/a&gt;. Tukiauau had a handsome son Korokiwhiti. The daughter and son now fell in love but the woman's father, the chief of the Taieri Mouth pa, disapproved. The young man's father was a hunted man. Hearing his enemies had discovered his whereabouts he decided to abandon the upriver settlement and move his people further south. As they came down the river in their canoes the distraught young woman attempted to jump from a rock into her lover's craft but struck the prow and was killed. Adding insult to injury her head was severed and held up angrily to her people on the shore as the flotilla passed by to the sea. There were repercussions and Tukiauau and his son were pursued and eventually killed.\nMaori occupation continued and Edward Shortland recorded a small settlement on the site in 1843 and Maori were still living here in 1850. An early European settler was a former whaler, 'The Hermit of Taieri Mouth' (also known as John Bull) whose real name was John Edward O'Neil. He is remembered for his boisterous ways and prodigious strength.\nDemographics.\nTaieri Mouth is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement.
