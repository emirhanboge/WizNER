    "text": "The Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) was a &lt;a href=\"corps\"&gt;corps&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;. At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps. In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment. In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers&lt;/a&gt; (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Service%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Army Service Corps&lt;/a&gt; were in turn passed over to the RAOC. The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores. In 1964 the &lt;a href=\"McLeod%20Reorganisation%20of%20Army%20Logistics\"&gt;McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Fire%20Service\"&gt;Army Fire Service&lt;/a&gt;, barrack services, sponsorship of &lt;a href=\"NAAFI\"&gt;NAAFI&lt;/a&gt; (EFI) and the management of &lt;a href=\"staff%20clerk\"&gt;staff clerk&lt;/a&gt;s from the same Corps. On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Logistic%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Logistic Corps&lt;/a&gt; (RLC).\nThe permanent establishment of an &lt;a href=\"Ordnance%20Office\"&gt;Ordnance Office&lt;/a&gt; long predated that of a &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt; in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-&lt;a href=\"bowyer\"&gt;bowyer&lt;/a&gt;s, master-&lt;a href=\"Fletcher%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;fletchers&lt;/a&gt;, master-&lt;a href=\"carpenters\"&gt;carpenters&lt;/a&gt; and master-&lt;a href=\"Metalsmith\"&gt;smiths&lt;/a&gt; who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, &lt;a href=\"clerk\"&gt;clerk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Armed-forces%20artificer\"&gt;artificers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armourers\"&gt;armourers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storeman\"&gt;storemen&lt;/a&gt; of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.\nPredecessors of the RAOC.\nSupply and repair of technical equipment, principally artillery and small arms, was the responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Master%20General%20of%20the%20Ordnance\"&gt;Master General of the Ordnance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Ordnance\"&gt;Board of Ordnance&lt;/a&gt; from the Middle Ages until they lost their independence in 1855. Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \nBefore Crimea.\nThe Board of Ordnance had its own military establishment consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; (who were not at that time part of the British Army). The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the &lt;a href=\"Civilian\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not &lt;a href=\"Military%20deployment\"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere. In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, &lt;a href=\"military%20engineers\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"artillerymen\"&gt;artillerymen&lt;/a&gt; received their commissions or patents from the &lt;a href=\"Master-General%20of%20the%20Ordnance\"&gt;Master-General of the Ordnance&lt;/a&gt;, as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold &lt;a href=\"epaulettes\"&gt;epaulettes&lt;/a&gt; indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-&lt;a href=\"hilt\"&gt;hilt&lt;/a&gt;ed sword and a &lt;a href=\"cocked%20hat\"&gt;cocked hat&lt;/a&gt;; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Waterloo\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer. The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the , both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the &lt;a href=\"theatre%20of%20war\"&gt;theatre of war&lt;/a&gt;.\nField Train Department of the Board of Ordnance.\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Arsenal\"&gt;Royal Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;) had outgrown the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt; as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm. In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20battle\"&gt;in the field&lt;/a&gt; (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the &lt;a href=\"Commissariat\"&gt;Commissariat&lt;/a&gt;, a department of &lt;a href=\"HM%20Treasury\"&gt;HM Treasury&lt;/a&gt;). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the &lt;a href=\"theatre%20of%20war\"&gt;theatre of war&lt;/a&gt; was achieved by the formation of &lt;a href=\"artillery%20train\"&gt;artillery train&lt;/a&gt;s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the Board sought to place this \"ad hoc\" arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a Field Train Department. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior &lt;a href=\"Commissary\"&gt;Commissary&lt;/a&gt; based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Major\"&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Army%29\"&gt;Captains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"subalterns\"&gt;subalterns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NCOs\"&gt;NCOs&lt;/a&gt; respectively). In peace time nothing more than a small &lt;a href=\"Cadre%20%28military%29\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt; of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as &lt;a href=\"Conductor%20%28military%20appointment%29\"&gt;Military Conductors&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the civilian staff.\nWith regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and &lt;a href=\"forage\"&gt;forage&lt;/a&gt;). The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their &lt;a href=\"pontoon%20bridge\"&gt;pontoon bridge&lt;/a&gt;s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of &lt;a href=\"artillery%20piece\"&gt;artillery piece&lt;/a&gt;s in the field (other than those pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horse%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Horse Artillery&lt;/a&gt;). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns. In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Artillery%20Barracks%23Related%20institutions%20in%20Woolwich\"&gt;Grand Depot&lt;/a&gt; (just off &lt;a href=\"Woolwich%20Common\"&gt;Woolwich Common&lt;/a&gt;) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was &lt;a href=\"mobilized\"&gt;mobilized&lt;/a&gt; once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Waggon%20Train\"&gt;Royal Waggon Train&lt;/a&gt;, first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare); after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).\nAfter Crimea.\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC. The Military Store Department (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories. In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the Military Store Clerks Corps (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties. These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Arsenal\"&gt;Woolwich Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weedon%20Bec\"&gt;Weedon Bec&lt;/a&gt;, but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a Military Store Staff Corps (MSSC) to provide soldiers: initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Service%20Corps\"&gt;Army Service Corps&lt;/a&gt; (ASC) under the &lt;a href=\"Control%20Department\"&gt;Control Department&lt;/a&gt;. The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC. This arrangement lasted until 1876.\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876. The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created Ordnance Stores Department (OSD). Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the Ordnance Store Corps (OSC). In 1894 there were further changes. The OSD was retitled the Army Ordnance Department (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt; (RA). In parallel the OSC was retitled the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; the Corps received the \"Royal\" prefix in 1922 in recognition of its service during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrdnance Services Organisation before 1914.\nDepots and other installations.\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;, headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Ordnance%20Office\"&gt;Ordnance Office&lt;/a&gt;, which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at &lt;a href=\"Woolwich\"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/a&gt; which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Arsenal\"&gt;Royal Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at &lt;a href=\"Purfleet\"&gt;Purfleet&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at &lt;a href=\"Weedon%20Bec\"&gt;Weedon&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition; and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When &lt;a href=\"Woolwich%20Dockyard\"&gt;Woolwich Dockyard&lt;/a&gt; closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Arsenal%20Railway\"&gt;linked by rail&lt;/a&gt;) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, &lt;a href=\"Horse%20harness\"&gt;harnesses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"accoutrements\"&gt;accoutrements&lt;/a&gt; and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Marine%20Barracks%2C%20Woolwich\"&gt;Royal Marine Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, linked to the nearby Dockyard); as &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Marine%20Barracks%2C%20Woolwich%23Red%20Barracks\"&gt;Red Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, it would continue to serve as the &lt;a href=\"Regimental%20depot\"&gt;regimental Depot&lt;/a&gt;, headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of &lt;a href=\"Chatham%20Dockyard%23The%20Gun%20Wharf\"&gt;Chatham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunwharf%20Quays\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HMNB%20Devonport%23Morice%20Yard%20%28New%20Gun%20Wharf%29\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of &lt;a href=\"mobilization\"&gt;mobilization&lt;/a&gt;. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20Garrison\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt;: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores. In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in &lt;a href=\"Ordnance%20Depot%20Quetta%2C%20Rawalpindi%20and%20Karachi\"&gt;Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi&lt;/a&gt; (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helena\"&gt;St Helena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Colony\"&gt;Cape of Good Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Straits%20Settlements\"&gt;Straits Settlements&lt;/a&gt;. There was also a substantial detachment supporting the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Zulu%20War\"&gt;Anglo-Zulu War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colony%20of%20Natal\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1895 the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Clothing%20Depot\"&gt;Royal Army Clothing Department&lt;/a&gt;, with its factory and depot at &lt;a href=\"Pimlico\"&gt;Pimlico&lt;/a&gt;, was taken over by the AOD which then became responsible for the provision of uniforms and other items of clothing for much of the army.\nField units.\nIn 1855 Captain Henry Gordon (brother of the famous &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20of%20Khartoum\"&gt;Gordon of Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;) left the Army and joined the Ordnance department; From March that year until July 1856 he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Balaklava\"&gt;Balaklava&lt;/a&gt; to take charge of all stores for all branches of the army: the first time an Ordnance Storekeeper had been appointed in the field of battle. The following year, a memorandum was issued making it clear that, in future, a staff of Military Store officers, clerks, artificers and labourers should accompany troops at time of war to ensure abundant provision of equipment for immediate use together with effective maintenance of reserve stocks in the field. These arrangements were put into practice both in &lt;a href=\"Anglo-French%20expedition%20to%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20the%20Waikato\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in 1860. The labourers and artificers were civilians, until the establishment of the Military Store Staff Corps in 1865.\nThere was substantial support by the RAOC's predecessors for every late Victorian expedition with the major efforts being the campaigns in Egypt and the Sudan (1882-5 and 1898) and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Boer War&lt;/a&gt; (1899-1902). All campaigns required the support of very large numbers of troops, animals and equipment in hostile environments. They produced a well-developed system of stores dumps and repair facilities along extended lines of communication.\nFirst World War.\nAs with the rest of the British Army the AOD/AOC was transformed by the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. Both the sheer scale of the war and the increasing technical complexity created an organisational structure that, in its outlines, survives until today. The depots at Woolwich, Weedon and Pimlico were supplemented by the wholesale takeover of warehouses throughout the country and in early 1915 a depot was established at &lt;a href=\"Vauxhall%20Barracks\"&gt;Didcot&lt;/a&gt; to be the major focus for the receipt and distribution of RAOC stores. Ammunition storage was also expanded dramatically and the former peacetime magazines at places such as Purfleet, &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; were supplemented by purpose built depots at &lt;a href=\"Bramley%20Camp\"&gt;Bramley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altrincham\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Credenhill\"&gt;Credenhill&lt;/a&gt; and Didcot.\nOn the Western Front a highly successful logistic infrastructure, largely rail based, was created to support the front. Parallel systems, but of less complexity, supported operations in Italy. Other expeditions such as Gallipoli, Salonika, Palestine and Mesopotamia brought supply challenges and a large logistic bases were established on the Egyptian Canal Zone and &lt;a href=\"Basra\"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;.\n1920\u20131945.\nAfter the war there was considerable retrenchment. In the 1920s the RAOC's principal depots were Bramley (ammunition), &lt;a href=\"Chilwell\"&gt;Chilwell&lt;/a&gt; (general and surplus stores), &lt;a href=\"ROF%20Rotherwas\"&gt;Hereford&lt;/a&gt; (ammunition), Pimlico (clothing), Woolwich (gun stores and ammunition) and Weedon (small arms). In 1922 the RAOC headquarters, regimental depot and School of Instruction moved from Woolwich to &lt;a href=\"Hilsea%20Barracks\"&gt;Hilsea Barracks&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of Portsmouth. (The School provided education and training in all aspects of the Corps' work, with the exception of ammunition which was taught at Bramley, where the &lt;a href=\"Army%20School%20of%20Ammunition\"&gt;Army School of Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; was opened that same year.) The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Clothing%20Depot\"&gt;Royal Army Clothing Depot&lt;/a&gt;, Pimlico, closed in 1932 and its stock was mostly transferred to Didcot.\nIn the 1930s re-armament and the mechanisation of the Army led to a redesign of the UK base. A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War &lt;a href=\"National%20Shell%20Filling%20Factory%2C%20Chilwell\"&gt;National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1937. The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. &lt;a href=\"Branston%20Depot\"&gt;COD Branston&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot. At the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; there were five CODs: Branston, Chilwell, Didcot, Weedon and Woolwich.\nWoolwich was prone to &lt;a href=\"aerial%20bombardment\"&gt;aerial bombardment&lt;/a&gt;, so from September 1939 the War Department leased part of an industrial estate in &lt;a href=\"Greenford\"&gt;Greenford&lt;/a&gt;, which provided 632,000 square feet of covered accommodation. A further COD to hold non-vehicle technical stores opened at &lt;a href=\"MoD%20Donnington\"&gt;Donnington&lt;/a&gt;, Shropshire in 1940 (in order to remove critical items from Woolwich to a less vulnerable site) and purpose-built depots for both tracked and wheeled vehicles were opened across the country. Woolwich then ceased operating as a COD (though by the end of 1942 it was again being used for bulk storage, albeit as a sub-depot of COD Greenford).\nIn the 1930s virtually all the Army's stockpile of ammunition was held at Bramley, which was vulnerable to air attack, so three new Central Ammunition Depots (CAD) were built: Serving south, central and northern England respectively, these were &lt;a href=\"CAD%20Monkton%20Farleigh\"&gt;CAD Monkton Farleigh&lt;/a&gt;, Wiltshire (also known as &lt;a href=\"MoD%20Corsham\"&gt;CAD Corsham&lt;/a&gt;, an underground depot); &lt;a href=\"CAD%20Nesscliffe\"&gt;CAD Nesscliffe&lt;/a&gt;, Shropshire; and &lt;a href=\"CAD%20Longtown\"&gt;CAD Longtown&lt;/a&gt;, Cumbria. By 1942 more storage capacity was required and another CAD was opened: &lt;a href=\"MoD%20Kineton\"&gt;Kineton&lt;/a&gt;. That same year a very large COD, widely spread out across the Oxfordshire countryside to mitigate the risk of bomb damage, opened at &lt;a href=\"MoD%20Bicester\"&gt;Bicester&lt;/a&gt; to hold stores principally to support the invasion of France.\nForward of the UK base, a huge array of temporary depots were built to meet the rapidly changing pace of war. Base Ordnance Depots (BOD) and Base Ammunition Depots (BAD) sprung up all over the world wherever a major line of communication was established.\nMajor changes took place after 1942 when the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers&lt;/a&gt; (REME) absorbed most of the RAOC repair functions and the RAOC in turn took over the RASC's vehicle organisation. The more mobile nature of the Second World War also led to the creation of units at divisional and corps level with higher levels of mobility. The most notable of these was the ordnance field park, principally carrying vehicle and technical stores spares.\nPost-war to 1993.\nDuring the war the RAOC HQ (together with the RAOC School) had moved from Hilsea to &lt;a href=\"Middleton%20Stoney\"&gt;Middleton Stoney&lt;/a&gt; (Bicester); in 1946 it moved again to Matthew Barracks, &lt;a href=\"Tidworth%20Camp\"&gt;Tidworth&lt;/a&gt; and shortly afterwards to &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Royal%20Barracks%2C%20Deepcut\"&gt;Deepcut&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"regimental%20depot\"&gt;regimental depot&lt;/a&gt; was also moved from Hilsea, in 1946, to &lt;a href=\"MoD%20Feltham\"&gt;Feltham Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, Middlesex; in 1955 it too moved to Deepcut. Hilsea, which had been used by the US Army during the war, continued to be used (alongside Deepcut) as a training facility for RAOC-enlisted &lt;a href=\"National%20Service%20Act%201948\"&gt;National Service&lt;/a&gt; recruits; with National Service coming to an end the Barracks closed in 1962 (but not before serving again, temporarily, as the regimental depot from 1960-1962 while Deepcut was being rebuilt).\nA major task that fell to the RAOC in the wake of the war was disposal of ammunition. As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20Technician\"&gt;Ammunition Technician&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20Technical%20Officer\"&gt;Ammunition Technical Officer&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Army%20School%20of%20Ammunition\"&gt;Army School of Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of &lt;a href=\"321%20EOD%20Squadron%20RLC\"&gt;321 EOD Unit&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with &lt;a href=\"improvised%20explosive%20devices\"&gt;improvised explosive devices&lt;/a&gt;; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through &lt;a href=\"the%20Troubles\"&gt;the Troubles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards &lt;a href=\"computer\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt;isation came with the opening of an &lt;a href=\"Automated%20data%20medium\"&gt;Automated Data Processing&lt;/a&gt; Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.)\nThe &lt;a href=\"Free%20Officers%20Movement%20%28Egypt%29\"&gt;Free Officers Movement (Egypt)&lt;/a&gt; concluded the &lt;a href=\"Anglo%E2%80%93Egyptian%20Agreement%20of%201954\"&gt;Anglo\u2013Egyptian Agreement of 1954&lt;/a&gt;, signed on 19 October, with Great Britain. The agreement stipulated a phased evacuation of &lt;a href=\"British%20Troops%20in%20Egypt\"&gt;British troops&lt;/a&gt; from the Suez base, agreed to withdrawal of all troops within 20 months (that is, June 1956); maintenance of the base was to be continued; and allowed Britain to hold the right to return for seven years. The compromise solution to retain British influence over the Suez Canal base area, seen as vital in the event of any future Middle East war with the Soviet Union, was to arrange the Canal Zone depot area to be taken over by specially arranged British civilian contractors. As the risk of British-Egyptian ruptures over the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt; rose, between September 20, 1955, and December 30, 1955, almost all the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;Middle East Land Forces&lt;/a&gt; Canal Zone depots and workshops were handed over to the contractors. Among them were 2 Base Workshop, 5 Base Ordnance Depot, and the Base Vehicle Depot all at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20el%20Kebir\"&gt;Tel el Kebir&lt;/a&gt;; 9 Base Ammunition Depot at Abu Sultan near &lt;a href=\"Deversoir%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Deversoir Air Base&lt;/a&gt;; and the engineering base group (probably including Nos 8 and 9 Engineer Stores Base Depots at Suez and &lt;a href=\"Fanara\"&gt;Fanara&lt;/a&gt; respectively). Other establishments included 33 Supply Reserve Depot and 10 Base Ordnance Depot.\nIn the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'. By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs &lt;a href=\"Branston%2C%20Staffordshire\"&gt;Branston&lt;/a&gt; and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: &lt;a href=\"Ludgershall%2C%20Wiltshire\"&gt;Ludgershall&lt;/a&gt; for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and &lt;a href=\"Ashchurch\"&gt;Ashchurch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hilton%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Hilton&lt;/a&gt; for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehicles (CVD &lt;a href=\"Marchington\"&gt;Marchington&lt;/a&gt; having closed in 1965, CVDs &lt;a href=\"Feltham\"&gt;Feltham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irvine%2C%20North%20Ayrshire\"&gt;Irvine&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1970s).\nAcross the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down. A reconfiguration in the late 1960s provided four Regional Depots (&lt;a href=\"Thatcham%20railway%20station%23Thatcham%20Ordnance%20Depot\"&gt;Thatcham&lt;/a&gt;, Hereford, &lt;a href=\"Catterick%20Garrison\"&gt;Catterick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forthside%20Barracks\"&gt;Stirling&lt;/a&gt;) and nine OSUs: Aldershot, &lt;a href=\"Ashford%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Ashford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burscough\"&gt;Burscough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20Garrison\"&gt;Colchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltham\"&gt;Feltham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dalby\"&gt;Old Dalby&lt;/a&gt;, Thetford, Tidworth and Woolwich (which had been downgraded following the closure of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory\"&gt;Royal Ordnance Factory&lt;/a&gt; and the sale of the old Dockyard). At the height of the Northern Ireland troubles Ordnance Depot &lt;a href=\"Holywood\"&gt;Kinnegar&lt;/a&gt; was a major logistic facility but is now much reduced.\nOverseas, 3 BOD in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; closed in 1972 leaving a &lt;a href=\"Central%20Ordnance%20Munitions%20Depot\"&gt;Composite Ordnance Depot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; (that finally closed shortly before handover in 1997). The Middle East logistic base withdrew from Egypt in 1956 \u2013 5 BOD and 9 BAD closing in 1955 \u2013 and was partially re-established in &lt;a href=\"Aden\"&gt;Aden&lt;/a&gt;; in turn this closed in 1967 with facilities being established in &lt;a href=\"Sharjah\"&gt;Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; (these, in turn, closed in 1971). The Ordnance depot in Gibraltar, where the Board of Ordnance had first established a facility in 1704, was transferred to the Royal Navy in 1964; and the depot in Malta, dating from the 1830s, closed in March 1972. The Ordnance Depot in Cyprus became part of the Joint Logistic Unit in 1988. In Germany, 15 BOD and 3 Base Ammunition and Petrol Depot (BAPD) closed in 1992.\nTwo post-war campaigns (Falklands 1982 and Gulf 1990/1) were unique in being fought in areas completely outside existing theatres. Temporary lines of communication were rapidly established that successfully managed huge surges in mat\u00e9riel.\nFormation of Royal Logistic Corps.\nOn 5 April 1993, following the &lt;a href=\"Options%20for%20Change\"&gt;Options for Change&lt;/a&gt; review, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps united with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Corps%20of%20Transport\"&gt;Royal Corps of Transport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pioneer%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Pioneer Corps&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Catering%20Corps\"&gt;Army Catering Corps&lt;/a&gt;, and the Postal and Courier Service of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, to form the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Logistic%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Logistic Corps&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year the RLC withdrew from the Tower of London, where the RAOC had continued to maintain a centuries-old link; and the following year the last vestige of the once-vast ordnance depot left Woolwich, with the closure of Royal Arsenal (West) and departure of the Ordnance QAD (Quality Assurance Directorate).\nAppointments in the RAOC.\nAppointments in the RAOC.\nPrior to 1981/82 the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, in common with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;, used the idiosyncratic system of staff titles that was unique to British and most Commonwealth armies. After 1981 in &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; assigned units, principally those in &lt;a href=\"British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine\"&gt;British Army of the Rhine&lt;/a&gt; (BAOR), the standard NATO system was adopted with all appointments elsewhere changing the following year.\nThe senior RAOC appointment was Director Equipment and Ordnance Stores (DEOS) \u2212 always a &lt;a href=\"Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Major-General&lt;/a&gt; \u2212 which during the 1920s became Director Ordnance Services (DOS). DOS was also a title given to senior RAOC officers at major commands such as &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20Command\"&gt;Middle East Command&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"21st%20Army%20Group\"&gt;21st Army Group&lt;/a&gt; and in more recent times BAOR. After the &lt;a href=\"Somerville%20Logistic%20Reorganisation%20Committee%20Report\"&gt;Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report&lt;/a&gt; of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS). Following the huge expansion of the RAOC in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; the senior RAOC major general was designated Controller Ordnance Services (COS) from 1942 to 1948\nAfter 1980/1 most of these titles disappeared with the notable exception of CATO/SATO and DOWO/BOWO. All RAOC appointments gave the staff grade (e.g. Staff Officer Grade 2: SO2 suffixed with the word Sup), the head of corps in a headquarters irrespective of rank was titled Comd Sup. In MOD the titles of DGOS and DDOS were retained.\nGeneral Ordnance Services heads.\nThis is a list of heads of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps\nDirectors of Supply Management.\nThis is a list of directors of Supply Management of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps\nRegimental Matters.\nThe RAOC's &lt;a href=\"motto\"&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; was that of the Board of Ordnance: \"Sua tela tonanti\" (literally \"His [i.e. &lt;a href=\"Jupiter%20%28god%29\"&gt;Jupiter's&lt;/a&gt;] Missiles to the one who is Thundering\", but commonly translated as \"To the Warrior his Arms\").\nThe full-dress uniform of the RAOC had evolved from that worn by the Field Train Department in the eighteenth century, itself derived from the uniform of the Royal Artillery. Consisting of a blue tunic with red collar and cuffs and blue trousers with a double red stripe, it continued to be worn by the band (and in mess-dress form) until the corps' amalgamation.\nThe RAOC Band had first been formed in 1922; the regimental march (chosen by its first Bandmaster, WOI R. T. Stevens, as appropriate to the Corps' role and to its artisans) was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Village%20Blacksmith\"&gt;The Village Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn common with the Royal Artillery, the RAOC had &lt;a href=\"St%20Barbara\"&gt;St Barbara&lt;/a&gt; as its &lt;a href=\"patron%20saint\"&gt;patron saint&lt;/a&gt;. The garrison church, first at Hilsea and then at Deepcut, was dedicated in her name; the pulpit, organ, stained glass windows and several memorials were transferred from the former to the latter when Hilsea Barracks closed in 1962. There was also a St Barbara's Church at CAD Bramley, which had originally come from the depot in Pimlico; having done service in Bramley for 52 years it was again disassembled in 1978 and moved to Didcot.\nThe RAOC Gazette.\nThe official journal of the corps was the RAOC Gazette.\nRecruiting.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, RAOC recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall (5 feet 4 inches for Driver Mechanics) and could enlist up to 25 years of age. They initially enlisted for three years with the colours and a further nine years with the reserve. Fitters could also choose six years with the colours and six years in the reserve, or eight and four years. Clerks and Storemen enlisted for six years and six years. They trained at the RAOC Depot, &lt;a href=\"Hilsea%20Barracks\"&gt;Hilsea Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, before proceeding to specialist trade training. Armourers were only recruited from boy entrants and enlisted for twelve years. Armament Artificers trained at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20College%20of%20Science\"&gt;Military College of Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woolwich\"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/a&gt; for fifteen months. Half of them were serving soldiers who were already qualified fitters. Armament Artificers had to be at least 22 years of age and could enlist up to 30; they enlisted for twelve years and were promoted &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Sergeant\"&gt;Staff Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they had completed training."
