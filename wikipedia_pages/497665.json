    "text": "Ubu Roi (; \"Ubu the King\" or \"King Ubu\") is a &lt;a href=\"play%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; by French writer &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Jarry\"&gt;Alfred Jarry&lt;/a&gt;, then 23 years old. It was first performed in Paris in 1896, by &lt;a href=\"Lugn%C3%A9-Poe\"&gt;Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20l%27%C5%92uvre\"&gt;Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Nouveau-Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre\"&gt;Nouveau-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre&lt;/a&gt; (today, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris). The production's single public performance baffled and offended audiences with its unruliness and obscenity. Considered to be a wild, bizarre and comic play, significant for the way it overturns cultural rules, norms and conventions, it is seen by 20th- and 21st-century scholars to have opened the door for what became known as &lt;a href=\"Literary%20modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt; in the 20th century, and as a precursor to &lt;a href=\"Dada\"&gt;Dadaism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrealism\"&gt;Surrealism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd\"&gt;Theatre of the Absurd&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\n\"Ubu Roi\" was first performed in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; on December 10, 1896, by &lt;a href=\"Aur%C3%A9lien%20Lugn%C3%A9-Poe\"&gt;Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20l%27%C5%92uvre\"&gt;Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nouveau-Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre\"&gt;Nouveau-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre&lt;/a&gt; (today, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris), 15, rue Blanche, in the 9th arrondissement . The play \u2013 scheduled for an invited \"industry\" run-through followed by a single public performance the next night \u2013 caused a riotous response in the audience and denunciatory reviews in the days after. It is considered a wild, bizarre and comic play, significant for the way it overturns cultural rules, norms, and conventions. To some of those who were in the audience on opening night, including &lt;a href=\"W.%20B.%20Yeats\"&gt;W. B. Yeats&lt;/a&gt; and the poet and essayist &lt;a href=\"Catulle%20Mend%C3%A8s\"&gt;Catulle Mend\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed an event of revolutionary importance, but many were mystified and outraged by the work's seeming childishness, obscenity, and disrespect. It is now seen by some to have opened the door for what became known as &lt;a href=\"Literary%20modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt; in the 20th century. It is a precursor to &lt;a href=\"Dada\"&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrealism\"&gt;Surrealism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd\"&gt;Theatre of the Absurd&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first of three stylised burlesques in which Jarry satirises power, greed, and their evil practice \u2013 in particular the propensity of the complacent &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; to abuse the authority engendered by success.\nThe title is sometimes translated as \"King Turd\"; however, the word \"Ubu\" is actually merely a nonsense word that evolved from the French pronunciation of the name \"Hebert\", which was the name of one of Jarry's teachers who was the satirical target and inspirer of the first versions of the play.\nJarry made some suggestions regarding how his play should be performed. He wanted King Ubu to wear a cardboard horse's head in certain scenes, \"as in the old English theatre\", for he intended to \"write a \"&lt;a href=\"guignol\"&gt;guignol&lt;/a&gt;\"\". He thought a \"suitably costumed person would enter, as in puppet shows, to put up signs indicating the locations of the various scenes\". He also wanted costumes with as little specific local colour reference or historical accuracy as possible.\n\"Ubu Roi\" was followed by \"Ubu Cocu\" (\"Ubu Cuckolded\") and \"Ubu Encha\u00een\u00e9\" (\"Ubu in Chains\"), neither of which was performed during Jarry's 34-year life. One of his later works, a novel/essay on \"&lt;a href=\"pataphysics\"&gt;pataphysics&lt;/a&gt;\", is offered as an explanation behind the ideas that underpin \"Ubu Roi\". Pataphysics is, as Jarry explains, \"the science of the realm beyond metaphysics\". Pataphysics is a pseudo-science Jarry created to critique members of the academy. It studies the laws that \"govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one\". It is the \"science of imaginary solutions\".\nSynopsis.\nThe story is a parody of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;\" and some parts of \"&lt;a href=\"Hamlet\"&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Lear\"&gt;King Lear&lt;/a&gt;\". Though the writing and dialogue is obscene and childish, the material began to express something deeper, an inner consciousness in a way that is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Symbolists&lt;/a&gt;, with some critics considering Jarry a Symbolist author.\nAs the play begins, Ubu's wife convinces him to lead a revolution, and kills the King of Poland and most of the royal family. The King's son, Bougrelas, and the Queen escape, but the latter later dies. The ghost of the dead king appears to his son and calls for revenge. Back at the palace, Ubu, now King, begins heavily taxing the people and killing the nobles for their wealth. Ubu's henchman gets thrown into prison; who then escapes to Russia, where he has the Tsar declare war on Ubu. As Ubu heads out to confront the invading Russians, his wife tries to steal the money and treasures in the palace. She is driven away by Bougrelas, who is leading a revolt of the people against Ubu. She runs away to her husband, Ubu, who has, in the meantime, been defeated by the Russians, been abandoned by his followers, and been attacked by a bear. Ubu's wife pretends to be the angel Gabriel, in order to try to scare Ubu into forgiving her for her attempt to steal from him. They fight, and she is rescued by the entrance of Bougrelas, who is after Ubu. Ubu knocks down the attackers with the body of the dead bear, after which he and his wife flee to France, which ends the play.\nThe action contains motifs found in the plays of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;: a king's murder and a scheming wife from \"Macbeth\", the ghost from \"Hamlet\", Fortinbras' revolt from \"Hamlet\", the reneging of Buckingham's reward from \"&lt;a href=\"Richard%20III%20%28play%29\"&gt;Richard III&lt;/a&gt;\", and the pursuing bear from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Winter%27s%20Tale\"&gt;The Winter's Tale&lt;/a&gt;\". It also includes other cultural references, for example, to &lt;a href=\"Sophocles\"&gt;Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Oedipus%20Rex\"&gt;Oedipus Rex&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"\u0152dipe Roi\" in French) in the play's title. \"Ubu Roi\" is considered a descendant of the comic grotesque &lt;a href=\"French%20Renaissance\"&gt;French Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais&lt;/a&gt; and his \"&lt;a href=\"Gargantua%20and%20Pantagruel\"&gt;Gargantua and Pantagruel&lt;/a&gt;\" novels.\nThe language of the play is a unique mix of slang code-words, puns and near-gutter vocabulary, set to strange speech patterns.\nDevelopment.\n\"The beginnings of the original Ubu\", writes &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Taylor%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Jane Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, \"have attained the status of legend within French theatre culture\". In 1888, when he became a student at the Lyc\u00e9e in Rennes at the age of fifteen, Jarry encountered a brief farcical sketch, \"Les Polonais\", written by his friend Henri Morin, and Henri's brother Charles. This farce was part of a campaign by the students to ridicule their physics teacher, F\u00e9lix-Frederic H\u00e9bert (1832\u20131917). \"Les Polonais\" depicted their teacher as the King of &lt;a href=\"Fictional%20country\"&gt;an imaginary&lt;/a&gt; Poland, and was one of many plays created around P\u00e8re H\u00e9b\u00e9, the character that, in Jarry's hands, eventually evolved into King Ubu. \"Les Polonais\" was performed as a marionette play by the students at their homes in what they called the \"Theatre des Phynances\", named in honor of P\u00e8re H\u00e9bert's lust for \"phynance\" (finance), or money. This prototype for \"Ubu Roi\" is long-lost, so the true and complete details of the authorship of \"Ubu Roi\" may never be known. It is clear, however, that Jarry considerably revised and expanded the play.\nWhile his schoolmates lost interest in the Ubu legends when they left school, Jarry continued adding to and reworking the material for the rest of his short life. His plays are controversial for their scant respect to royalty, religion and society, their vulgarity and scatology, their brutality and low comedy, and their perceived utter lack of literary finish.\nUbu.\nAccording to Jane Taylor, \"the central character is notorious for his infantile engagement with his world. Ubu inhabits a domain of greedy self-gratification\". Jarry's metaphor for the modern man, he is an antihero \u2013 fat, ugly, vulgar, gluttonous, grandiose, dishonest, stupid, jejune, voracious, greedy, cruel, cowardly and evil \u2013 who grew out of schoolboy legends about the imaginary life of a hated teacher who had been at one point a slave on a &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"galley\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;, at another frozen in ice in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and at one more the King of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ubu Roi\" follows and explores his political, martial and felonious exploits.\n\"There is\", writes Taylor, \"a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks. Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence. While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself. He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost\". The derived adjective \"ubuesque\" is recurrent in French and francophone political debate.\nPremi\u00e8re.\nBoth \"Ubu Cocu\" and \"Ubu Roi\" have a convoluted history, going through decades of rewriting and, in the case of the former, never arriving, despite Jarry's exertions, at a definitive version. By the time Jarry wanted \"Ubu Roi\" published and staged, the Morins had lost their interest in schoolboy japes, and Henri gave Jarry permission to do whatever he wanted with them. Charles, however, later tried to claim credit, but it had never been a secret that he had had some involvement with the earliest version. The music was composed and performed at the premiere by &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Terrasse\"&gt;Claude Terrasse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first word of the play (\"merdre\", the French word for \"shit\", with an extra \"r\") may have been part of the reason for the response to the play in Paris. At the end of the performance a riot broke out, an incident which has since become \"a stock element of Jarry biographia\". After this, \"Ubu Roi\" was outlawed from the stage, and Jarry moved it to a puppet theatre.\nJarry said to the audience in a curtain speech just before that first performance in Paris: \"You are free to see in M. Ubu however many allusions you care to, or else a simple puppet\u2014a school boy's caricature of one of his teachers who personified for him all the ugliness in the world\".\nThe poet &lt;a href=\"W.%20B.%20Yeats\"&gt;W. B. Yeats&lt;/a&gt;, though he did not understand French, attended the premiere with a companion who interpreted the action for him. He recalled, in his memoir \"The Trembling of the Veil\", his dismay that the play challenged the symbolist, spiritual-themed literature he advocated: \"Feeling bound to support the most spirited party, we have shouted for the play, but that night at the Hotel Corneille I am very sad, for comedy, objectivity, has displayed its growing power once more. I say, 'After St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, after Paul Verlaine, after Gustave Moreau, after Puvis de Chavannes, after our own verse, after all our subtle colour and nervous rhythm, after the faint mixed tints of Conder, what more is possible? After us the Savage God.'\u201d\nAdaptations.\n20th century.\nIn 1936 &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Boy-%C5%BBele%C5%84ski\"&gt;Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; modernist and prolific writer and translator created in &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; \"Ubu Kr\u00f3l czyli Polacy\" (\"King Ubu, otherwise, The Poles\"). Some of his phraseology in the play has passed into the language. In 1990, at the invitation of the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Opera\"&gt;Munich Opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Penderecki\"&gt;Krzysztof Penderecki&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=\"opera%20buffa\"&gt;opera buffa&lt;/a&gt; on Jarry's theme entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Ubu%20Rex\"&gt;Ubu Rex&lt;/a&gt;\", staged on 8 July 1991 for the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Opera%20Festival\"&gt;Munich Opera Festival&lt;/a&gt;; the opera was later mounted in Poland in 2003.\nThe first English translation was \"Ubu Roi. Drama in Five acts followed by the Song of Disembraining\", by &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Wright%20%28translator%29\"&gt;Barbara Wright&lt;/a&gt;, for which she wrote the preface. It was illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Franciszka%20Themerson\"&gt;Franciszka Themerson&lt;/a&gt; and published by the &lt;a href=\"Gaberbocchus%20Press\"&gt;Gaberbocchus Press&lt;/a&gt; in 1951.\nIn 1964 the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Puppet%20theatre\"&gt;Puppet theatre&lt;/a&gt; produced a highly popular version of \"Ubu Roi\" directed by Michael Meschke, with scenery by Franciszka Themerson.\n\"Ubu Roi\" was translated into Serbian in 1964 by and performed at the Atelje 212 theatre in Belgrade for the next 20 years, until &lt;a href=\"Zoran%20Radmilovi%C4%87\"&gt;Zoran Radmilovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, who played P\u00e8re Ubu, died. The play was so successful that it was adapted into a movie in 1973.\n\"Ubu Roi\" was translated into &lt;a href=\"Czech%20language\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ji%C5%99%C3%AD%20Voskovec\"&gt;Ji\u0159\u00ed Voskovec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Werich\"&gt;Jan Werich&lt;/a&gt; as \"Kr\u00e1l Ubu\", and premiered in 1928 at &lt;a href=\"Osvobozen%C3%A9%20divadlo\"&gt;Osvobozen\u00e9 divadlo&lt;/a&gt;. The play was banned in &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;1968 Soviet invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe play was the basis for &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Lenica\"&gt;Jan Lenica&lt;/a&gt;'s animated film \"&lt;a href=\"Ubu%20et%20la%20Grande%20Gidouille\"&gt;Ubu et la Grande Gidouille&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976).\nIn 1976\u20131977 &lt;a href=\"Oakley%20Hall%20III\"&gt;Oakley Hall III&lt;/a&gt; translated and adapted \"Ubu Roi\" (called \"Ubu Rex\") and its sequels, and directed them in New York City &lt;a href=\"Off-Off-Broadway\"&gt;Off-Off-Broadway&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Lexington%20Conservatory%20Theatre\"&gt;Lexington Conservatory Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lexington%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Lexington, New York&lt;/a&gt;. The adaptations starred &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Zobel\"&gt;Richard Zobel&lt;/a&gt;, who also produced the play and created the masks for it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; (then part of the USSR) the play was adapted as \"Karalius \u016abas\" by director &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Vaitkus\"&gt;Jonas Vaitkus&lt;/a&gt; in 1983.\nThe play was adapted into an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Finnissy\"&gt;Michael Finnissy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Toovey\"&gt;Andrew Toovey&lt;/a&gt; and music by Toovey. It was produced by the Banff Centre Theatre, Canada, in collaboration with Music Theatre Wales, in May 1992, directed by Keith Turnbull.\nA musical adaptation, \"&lt;a href=\"Ubu%20Rock\"&gt;Ubu Rock&lt;/a&gt;\", book by Andrei Belgrader and Shelly Berc, music and lyrics by &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Magee\"&gt;Rusty Magee&lt;/a&gt;, premiered at the &lt;a href=\"American%20Repertory%20Theater\"&gt;American Repertory Theater&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 and was remounted at ART the following year.\nThe play was adapted for the Czech film \"Kr\u00e1l Ubu\", directed by F. A. Brabec in 1996. The film received three &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Lion%20Awards\"&gt;Czech Lion Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nSherry C. M. Lindquist's adaptation was performed in Chicago, at &lt;a href=\"The%20Public%20Theater\"&gt;The Public Theater&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, at the International Festival of Puppet Theater, and at the Edison Theater, St. Louis, Missouri, by Hystopolis Productions, Chicago, from 1996 to 1997.\n&lt;a href=\"Jane%20Taylor%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Jane Taylor&lt;/a&gt; adapted \"Ubu Roi\" as \"&lt;a href=\"Ubu%20and%20the%20Truth%20Commission\"&gt;Ubu and the Truth Commission&lt;/a&gt;\" (1998), a play addressing the emotional complexities revealed by the process of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Truth and Reconciliation Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed in response to the atrocities committed during &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;.\n21st century.\nIn Poland the play was adapted for the film \"Ubu Kr\u00f3l\" (2003) by &lt;a href=\"Piotr%20Szulkin\"&gt;Piotr Szulkin&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the grotesque nature of political life in Poland immediately after the fall of communism.\nThe play was translated by David Ball in \"The Norton Anthology of Drama\" in 2010, and performed at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; the same year.\nInspired by the black comedy of corruption within \"Ubu Roi\", the Puerto Rican absurdist narrative \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20Banana\"&gt;United States of Banana&lt;/a&gt;\" (2011) by &lt;a href=\"Giannina%20Braschi\"&gt;Giannina Braschi&lt;/a&gt; dramatizes, with over-the-top grotesque flourishes of \"&lt;a href=\"pataphysics\"&gt;pataphysics&lt;/a&gt;\", the fall of the American Empire and the liberation of Puerto Rico.\nThe play was adapted and directed by Dash Kruck as part of Vena Cava Production's 2013 mainstage season. Performed in &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Brisbane, Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the adaptation made cultural political references to Queensland's Premier &lt;a href=\"Campbell%20Newman\"&gt;Campbell Newman&lt;/a&gt;, even including him in the show's promotional poster.\nIn 2014, &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"One%20Little%20Goat%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;One Little Goat Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt; produced \"Ubu Mayor: A Harmful Bit of Fun\", combining the \"merde\"-filled sensibilities of \"Ubu Roi\" with the internationally renowned antics, absurdities and obscenities of Toronto's mayor &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Ford\"&gt;Rob Ford&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Ford%20Jr.\"&gt;Doug&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2016, the play was adapted by Jared Strange into \"UBU ROY: An American Tale\", an updated version of the original play through the lens of the &lt;a href=\"2016%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2016 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. The show opened November 3, 2016, in &lt;a href=\"Lubbock%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Lubbock, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, as the Lubbock Community Theatre's first play in their \"LCT After Dark\" season.\nIn 2020, the play was adapted and set in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, taking place on a purpose-built stage in the &lt;a href=\"Cataract%20Gorge\"&gt;Cataract Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2020, the play was also adapted into a musical by Kneehigh Theatre company.\nIn February 2020, the Vernal &amp; Sere Theatre staged a world-premiere adaptation in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; called \"UBU\", which imagined the titular character of King Ubu as a principal walking the halls of a quintessential American school and called into question the fundamental system by which the United States governs and instructs its citizenry.\nReferences in popular culture.\nIn 1923, the Dadaist pioneer &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ernst\"&gt;Max Ernst&lt;/a&gt; produced a painting entitled \"Ubu Imperator\".\nAlfred Jarry is one of the few real figures to appear among the many literary characters in \"Les Faux-Monnayeurs\" (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Counterfeiters%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Counterfeiters&lt;/a&gt;\", 1925), by &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Gide\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Gide&lt;/a&gt;. In Part III, Chapter 8, Jarry attends a literary banquet, where the fictional Comte de Passavant introduces him as the author of \"Ubu Roi\", saying of the literary set, \"They have dubbed him a genius because the public have just damned his play. All the same, it's the most interesting thing that's been put on the stage for a long time\".\n&lt;a href=\"Joan%20Mir%C3%B3\"&gt;Joan Mir\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; used \"Ubu Roi\" as a subject of his 50 lithographs in 1940 called the &lt;a href=\"Barcelona%20Series\"&gt;Barcelona Series&lt;/a&gt;. These pictures could be Ubu Roi but they also satirise &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;General Franco&lt;/a&gt; and his generals after he had won the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn her book \"Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era\", &lt;a href=\"Linda%20McCartney\"&gt;Linda McCartney&lt;/a&gt; mentions that &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McCartney\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; had become interested in avant-garde theatre and immersed himself in the writings of Jarry. This is how McCartney discovered the word \"pataphysical\", which he used in the lyrics of his song \"&lt;a href=\"Maxwell%27s%20Silver%20Hammer\"&gt;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Jon%20Williams\"&gt;Walter Jon Williams&lt;/a&gt;' novel \"&lt;a href=\"Angel%20Station%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Angel Station&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on the plot.\nThe American experimental rock group &lt;a href=\"Pere%20Ubu\"&gt;Pere Ubu&lt;/a&gt; is named after the main character. Their 2009 album \"Long Live P\u00e8re Ubu!\" is an adaptation of Jarry's play.\n&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Can%20Dance\"&gt;Dead Can Dance&lt;/a&gt;'s frontman &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Perry\"&gt;Brendan Perry&lt;/a&gt; makes a reference to P\u00e8re Ubu in the song \"The Bogus Man\" (on his second solo album \"&lt;a href=\"Ark%20%28Brendan%20Perry%20album%29\"&gt;Ark&lt;/a&gt;\") with the line \"Hail, Father Ubu, here comes the Grand Guignol\".\nThe figure of Ubu Roi, particularly as depicted by Jarry in his woodcut, appears to have inspired the character &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20The%20Nightmare%20Before%20Christmas%20characters%23Oogie%20Boogie\"&gt;Oogie Boogie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Burton\"&gt;Tim Burton&lt;/a&gt;'s animated film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Nightmare%20Before%20Christmas\"&gt;The Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTelevision producer &lt;a href=\"Gary%20David%20Goldberg\"&gt;Gary David Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; named his dog Ubu and his production company &lt;a href=\"Ubu%20Productions\"&gt;Ubu Productions&lt;/a&gt; after Ubu Roi.\nAustralian band &lt;a href=\"Methyl%20Ethel\"&gt;Methyl Ethel&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"Ubu\" contains references to the play.\nNorwegian band &lt;a href=\"Arcturus%20%28band%29\"&gt;Arcturus&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Jarry\"&gt;Alfred Jarry&lt;/a&gt;'s pre-surrealist play \"Ubu the King\" quotes in the inner sleeve of their album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sham%20Mirrors\"&gt;The Sham Mirrors&lt;/a&gt;\", released in 2002."
