This channel divides the Northern from the Central atolls of the Maldives.\nThis channel was important for ancient mariners plying along the spice route trying to bypass the long and dangerous shallow reefs of the Maldives without harm.\nIn the British &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20charts\"&gt;Admiralty charts&lt;/a&gt; it is called Kardiva Channel. It appeared on the old French maps as Courant de Caridou. Locally it is also referred to as the northern part being the &lt;a href=\"Kaashidhoo%20Bodu%20Kandu\"&gt;Kaashidhoo Bodu Kandu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaashidhoo%20Kuda%20Kandu\"&gt;Kaashidhoo Kuda Kandu&lt;/a&gt; the southern part.\nKardiva is the ancient &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;ised name of &lt;a href=\"Kaashidhoo%20%28Kaafu%20Atoll%29\"&gt;Kaashidhu Island&lt;/a&gt;. This island lies towards the eastern end of this channel and gives its name to it. (\"Kardiva Channel\"). Kaashidhu Island is surrounded by deep waters and there is generally heavy surf all around. It has an oval-shaped lagoon (vilu) with a narrow fringing reef on its NW side. "
