    "text": "Bu\u0161ko Blato or Bu\u0161ko Jezero is an accumulation &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; located on the south side of &lt;a href=\"Livno%20field\"&gt;Livanjsko Polje&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Duvno\"&gt;Duvanjsko Polje&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. The name is also a reference to the area surrounding the lake which includes a number of villages, of which &lt;a href=\"Prisoje%2C%20Tomislavgrad\"&gt;Prisoje&lt;/a&gt; is the largest.\nHydrography.\nBu\u0161ko Blato lake, as well as entire watershed system, is a man-made, draining waters of &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"polje\"&gt;polje&lt;/a&gt;s of Western Herzegovina and Western Bosnia regions, in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dinaric%20Alps\"&gt;Dinaric Alps&lt;/a&gt;. These are almost exclusively &lt;a href=\"sinking%20rivers\"&gt;sinking rivers&lt;/a&gt;, draining waters of &lt;a href=\"Livanjsko%20Polje\"&gt;Livanjsko Polje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duvanjsko%20Polje\"&gt;Duvanjsko Polje&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kupre%C5%A1ko%20Polje\"&gt;Kupre\u0161ko Polje&lt;/a&gt; through system of &lt;a href=\"ponor\"&gt;ponor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"estavelle\"&gt;estavelle&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"sinkhole\"&gt;sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"subterranean%20river\"&gt;subterranean flows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"karst%20spring\"&gt;karstic wellsprings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe actual lake is elevated 716 m above sea level, has an area of 55.8\u00a0km\u00b2 and a total volume of 782 million m\u00b3. One third of the area falls under the jurisdiction of the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Livno\"&gt;Livno&lt;/a&gt; while the remaining two-thirds belongs to the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Tomislavgrad\"&gt;Tomislavgrad&lt;/a&gt;. The total area of Bu\u0161ko Blato makes it one of the largest accumulation lakes in all of Europe.\nNature and ecology.\nThe lake also consists of a rich and wide assortment of fish such as &lt;a href=\"Common%20carp\"&gt;carp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brown%20trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnow-Nase\"&gt;minnow-nase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20carp\"&gt;Prussian carp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"European%20chub\"&gt;chub&lt;/a&gt;.\nHydropower and irrigation system.\nBu\u0161ko Blato (blato meaning 'mud' or 'swamp' in Bosnian) was essentially farmland up until 1974 when it was converted into a lake (artificial &lt;a href=\"reservoir\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt;). The hydroelectric power plant system was conceived mainly to provide electricity for the &lt;a href=\"Dalmatia\"&gt;Dalmatian coastline&lt;/a&gt; and further development of tourism. \nThe governments of &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; (republics within &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; at the time) worked together on a project to build a hydroelectric power plant in &lt;a href=\"Rudo\"&gt;Rudo&lt;/a&gt; (municipality of &lt;a href=\"Otok%20%28Sinj%29\"&gt;Otok&lt;/a&gt; in Croatia) called &lt;a href=\"Orlovac%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;HE Orlovac&lt;/a&gt; that would have an output of 237 MW and an average annual yield of 366 GWh.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bistrica%20%28Livanjsko%20Polje%29\"&gt;Bistrica&lt;/a&gt; river is largest, and forms &lt;a href=\"Lipsko%20Lake\"&gt;Lipsko Lake&lt;/a&gt;, near village of &lt;a href=\"Lipa%20%28Livno%29\"&gt;Lipa&lt;/a&gt;, which is first and smaller of two artificial reservoirs in hydroelectric power plant system Bu\u0161ko Blato - &lt;a href=\"Orlovac%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;HE Orlovac&lt;/a&gt;, other being Bu\u0161ko Blato reservoir. In this system Lipsko Lake is a compensation basin and serves for regulation of an outflow of water toward intake facility at &lt;a href=\"penstock\"&gt;penstock&lt;/a&gt; station \"Lipa\" at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Kame%C5%A1nica%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Kame\u0161nica&lt;/a&gt; mountain, and across the border into &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; where hydroelectric power plant \"HE Orlovac\" is situated. \nLipsko Lake is connected with much larger reservoir of Bu\u0161ko Blato, whose &lt;a href=\"Hydraulic%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; can rise above head of Lipsko Lake up to several meters, via the reversible canal of \"Lipsko-Bu\u0161ko\" where it stores an excess waters from Livanjsko Polje and the Bistrica, especially during flooding season and high precipitation periods. For transfer of these waters over the barrage \"Podgradina\", at village &lt;a href=\"Podgradina%20%28Livno%29\"&gt;Podgradina&lt;/a&gt;, into Bu\u0161ko Blato reservoir, system uses reversible pumping station \"Bu\u0161ko Blato\", built at the point where canal reaches barrage."
