    "text": "The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an &lt;a href=\"inter-governmental%20organization\"&gt;inter-governmental organization&lt;/a&gt; headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Gaborone\"&gt;Gaborone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Botswana\"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;. Its goal is to further regional socio-economic cooperation and integration as well as political and security cooperation among 16 countries in southern Africa.\nMember states.\nAs of 2020, SADC has 16 &lt;a href=\"member%20states\"&gt;member states&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Union of Comoros was admitted into SADC at the 37th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Pretoria, South Africa in 2017, bringing the total number of Member States to 16. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Burundi\"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; has requested to join.\nThe origin and history of the SADC..\nThe origins of SADC are in the 1960s and 1970s, when the leaders of majority-ruled countries and national liberation movements coordinated their political, diplomatic and military struggles to bring an end to colonial and white-minority rule in southern Africa. The immediate forerunner of the political and security cooperation leg of today's SADC was the informal &lt;a href=\"Frontline%20States\"&gt;Frontline States&lt;/a&gt; (FLS) grouping. It was formed in 1980.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Southern%20African%20Development%20Coordination%20Conference\"&gt;Southern African Development Coordination Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SADCC) was the forerunner of the socio-economic cooperation leg of today's SADC. The adoption by nine majority-ruled southern African countries of the Lusaka declaration on 1 April 1980 paved the way for the formal establishment of SADCC in April 1980.\nMembership of the FLS and SADCC sometimes differed.\nSADCC was transformed into SADC on 17 August 1992, with the adoption by the founding members of SADCC and newly independent &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; of the Windhoek declaration and treaty establishing SADC. The 1992 SADC provided for both socio-economic cooperation and political and security cooperation. In reality, the FLS was dissolved only in 1994, after South Africa's first democratic elections. Subsequent efforts to place political and security cooperation on a firm institutional footing under SADC's umbrella failed.\nOn 14 August 2001, the 1992 SADC treaty was amended. The amendment heralded the overhaul of the structures, policies and procedures of SADC, a process which is ongoing. One of the changes is that political and security cooperation is institutionalised in the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS); one of the principal SADC bodies. It is subject to the oversight of the organisation's supreme body, the Summit, which comprises the heads of state or government.\nThe organisation holds its own &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20event\"&gt;multi-sport event&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the &lt;a href=\"SADC%20Games\"&gt;SADC Games&lt;/a&gt;, which was first held in 2004 in &lt;a href=\"Maputo\"&gt;Maputo&lt;/a&gt;. Originally planned for an earlier date in Malawi and Lesotho, organisational issues led to abandonment of the plan and the SADC issuing a fine of $100,000 against Malawi. The first event in 2004 in Maputo resulted in over 1000 youths under-20 from 10 countries taking part in a sports programme including &lt;a href=\"athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netball\"&gt;netball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2019 SADC adopted &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; as its fourth working language, alongside English, French and Portuguese. Kiswahili \u2013 a lingua franca in the &lt;a href=\"African%20Great%20Lakes\"&gt;African Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; region, other parts of East Africa, and to a lesser degree, parts of Southern Africa \u2013 is an official language of Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda and of the &lt;a href=\"African%20Union\"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nProtocols.\nSADC has 27 legally binding protocols dealing with issues such as Defence, Development, Illicit Drug Trade, Free Trade and Movement of People.\nSADC FTA.\nThe SADC &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Area\"&gt;Free Trade Area&lt;/a&gt; was established in August 2008, after the implementation of the SADC Protocol on Trade in 2000 laid the foundation for its formation. Its original members were &lt;a href=\"Botswana\"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesotho\"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seychelles\"&gt;Seychelles&lt;/a&gt; joining later. Of the 15 SADC member states, only &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; are not yet participating, however Angolan trade minister Joffre Van-D\u00fanen J\u00fanior said in Luanda that his ministry is working to create conditions for Angola's accession to the SADC Free Trade Area in 2019. The SADC-Customs Union, scheduled to be established by 2010 according to SADC's Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), is unlikely to become reality in the near future. This is because the European Union's Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with their inherent extra-regional freetrade regimes provided for several SADC members more benefits than deeper regional market integration within the framework of a SADC-Customs Union. Since these SADC countries formed four different groupings to negotiate and implement different Economic Partnership Agreements with European Union, the chance to establish a SADC-wide &lt;a href=\"common%20external%20tariff\"&gt;common external tariff&lt;/a&gt; as prerequisite for a regional customs union is missed.\nOn Wednesday 22 October 2008, SADC joined with the &lt;a href=\"Common%20Market%20for%20Eastern%20and%20Southern%20Africa\"&gt;Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Community\"&gt;East African Community&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt;, including all members of each of the organizations. The leaders of the three trading blocs agreed to create a single free trade zone, the &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $624bn (\u00a3382.9bn). It is hoped the &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt; agreement would ease access to markets within the zone and end problems arising from the fact that several of the member countries belong to multiple groups.\nThe &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt; effective has been more than a hundred years in the making\u2014a trade zone spanning the whole African continent from &lt;a href=\"Cape%20to%20Cairo%20Red%20Line\"&gt;Cape to Cairo&lt;/a&gt; and envisioned by &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20Rhodes\"&gt;Cecil Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; and other British imperialists in the 1890s. The only difference is that the &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt; is the creation of independent African Countries. The idea is a free trade zone spanning the whole continent from the Cape to Cairo (&lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Republic of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn addition to eliminating duplicative membership and the problem member states also participating in other regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine each other, the &lt;a href=\"African%20Free%20Trade%20Zone\"&gt;African Free Trade Zone&lt;/a&gt; further aims to strengthen the bloc's bargaining power when negotiating international deals.\nChallenges facing member countries.\nSADC countries face many social, development, economic, trade, education, health, diplomatic, defence, security and political challenges. Some of these challenges cannot be tackled effectively by individual members. Cattle diseases and organised-crime gangs know no boundaries. War in one country can suck in its neighbours and damage their economies. The sustainable development that trade could bring is threatened by the existence of different product standards and tariff regimes, weak customs infrastructure and bad roads. The socio-economic and political and security cooperation aims of SADC are equally wide-ranging, and intended to address the various common challenges.\nOne significant challenge is that member states also participate in other regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine SADC's aims. For example, South Africa and Botswana both belong to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Africa%20Customs%20Union\"&gt;Southern Africa Customs Union&lt;/a&gt;, Zambia is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Common%20Market%20for%20Eastern%20and%20Southern%20Africa\"&gt;Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and Tanzania is a member of the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Community\"&gt;East African Community&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, \"SADC has been criticized for its laxity on making human rights compliance within its member states a priority\".\nStructure and decision-making procedures.\nThe organisation has six principal bodies:\nExcept for the Tribunal (based in &lt;a href=\"Windhoek\"&gt;Windhoek&lt;/a&gt;, Namibia), SNCs and Secretariat, decision-making is by consensus."
