It is the smallest of the Nightingale Islands, and is to the north west of Nightingale Island itself. They are governed as part of &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20da%20Cunha\"&gt;Tristan da Cunha&lt;/a&gt;, an archipelago and part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20overseas%20territory\"&gt;British overseas territory&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Helena%2C%20Ascension%20and%20Tristan%20da%20Cunha\"&gt;Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha&lt;/a&gt;. The island is part of the Nightingale Islands group &lt;a href=\"Important%20Bird%20Area\"&gt;Important Bird Area&lt;/a&gt; (IBA), identified as such by &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; as a breeding site for &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s and endemic landbirds.\nThe island is named after the two brothers Gustav and Friedrich Stoltenhoff who tried to settle on nearby &lt;a href=\"Inaccessible%20Island\"&gt;Inaccessible Island&lt;/a&gt;. Their attempt was abandoned after two difficult years."
