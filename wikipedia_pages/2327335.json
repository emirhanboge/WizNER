    "text": "Robert B. Rivkin (born January 9, 1956), better known by the stage name Bobby Z., is an American musician and record producer, most known as being the original drummer for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Prince's&lt;/a&gt; backing band &lt;a href=\"The%20Revolution%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Revolution&lt;/a&gt; from 1978 to 1986.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nRivkin began his musical career at the age of six, playing several different instruments before finally settling on the &lt;a href=\"drums\"&gt;drums&lt;/a&gt;. In junior high school, he formed a small touring band in the &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt; area that included future &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; football coach &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Trestman\"&gt;Marc Trestman&lt;/a&gt; on rhythm guitar.\nCareer with Prince.\nHe met Prince in the late 1970s as Prince was forming his first band for touring. He started running errands for Prince while working for the man credited with discovering Prince, &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Husney\"&gt;Owen Husney&lt;/a&gt;. Rivkin's stage name, Bobby Z., was derived from the nickname \"Butzie\" his grandmother used to call him.\nPrince was adamant about having a &lt;a href=\"Whites\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; drummer in an effort to have a racially diverse band, so Husney implored Prince to audition Rivkin. Rivkin replaced Prince's cousin and original drummer Charles Smith much akin to &lt;a href=\"Sly%20and%20the%20Family%20Stone\"&gt;Sly and the Family Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Rivkin was acknowledged in Prince's self-titled album as being a \"heaven-sent\" helper alongside &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Cymone\"&gt;Andre Cymone&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the \"&lt;a href=\"1999%20%28Prince%20album%29\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;\" album was released, Prince was relying more and more on &lt;a href=\"electronic%20drum\"&gt;electronic drum&lt;/a&gt;s and Rivkin had to adapt his style to operate these in concert as well as the studio, starting with \"&lt;a href=\"Controversy%20%28Prince%20album%29\"&gt;Controversy&lt;/a&gt;\". He also contributed to \"&lt;a href=\"Purple%20Rain%20%28album%29\"&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Around%20the%20World%20in%20a%20Day\"&gt;Around the World in a Day&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Parade%20%28Prince%20album%29\"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Sign%20o%27%20the%20Times\"&gt;Sign o' the Times&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1986 when &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20%26amp%3B%20Lisa\"&gt;Wendy &amp; Lisa&lt;/a&gt; left The Revolution and the group disbanded after the &lt;a href=\"Parade%20Tour\"&gt;Parade Tour&lt;/a&gt; ended, Prince also took the opportunity to replace Rivkin with &lt;a href=\"Sheila%20E\"&gt;Sheila E&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of veteran &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Area\"&gt;Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; drummer and percussionist &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Escovedo\"&gt;Pete Escovedo&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer after Prince and The Revolution.\nBobby Z. produced The Suburbs' 1986 self-titled &lt;a href=\"A%26amp%3BM%20Records\"&gt;A&amp;M Records&lt;/a&gt; album (credited as Robert Brent). In 1988 he produced some tracks for &lt;a href=\"Boy%20George\"&gt;Boy George&lt;/a&gt;'s album, \"&lt;a href=\"High%20Hat%20%28album%29\"&gt;Tense Nervous Headache&lt;/a&gt;\". Rivkin helped Wendy &amp; Lisa on their debut album and he released his own self-titled album in 1989 (which included a re-recorded version of \"River Run Dry\" that he wrote for &lt;a href=\"The%20Family%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Family&lt;/a&gt;). Rivkin has since focused more on producing for the recently launched record label branch of Copycats media.\nHealth problems, recovery and reunions with Prince.\nBobby Z. suffered a &lt;a href=\"heart%20attack\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; in early 2010 and after his recovery made it his mission to continue to raise public awareness of heart attack warning signs and risk factors. He has lobbied Congress for continued research. He set up a fund raising charity called My Purple Heart which went about raising both funds and awareness of heart disease.\nIn 2011, he celebrated the one-year anniversary of surviving his near-fatal heart attack at First Avenue, with a rare reunion performance of The Revolution\u2014&lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Melvoin\"&gt;Wendy Melvoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Coleman%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Lisa Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Mark\"&gt;Brown Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Fink\"&gt;Dr. Fink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dez%20Dickerson\"&gt;Dez Dickerson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Leeds\"&gt;Eric Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and Bobby Z., which raised much needed funds to benefit heart-health awareness.\nThe concert, billed as a 'Benefit 2 Celebrate Life!' and presented by Z and the American Heart Association, featured The Revolution, along with heart-health and life-saving information and inspiring stories of survival. The Revolution had not played together since 2003.\nHis foundation, My Purple Heart, partnered with the American Heart Association again in 2013 to host a benefit concert and weekend block party on March 9, at First Avenue on the 2nd anniversary of his heart attack. Again members of The Revolution appeared alongside Bobby as well as star guests such as &lt;a href=\"Maya%20Rudolph\"&gt;Maya Rudolph&lt;/a&gt;, local boy and runner up from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Voice%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Voice&lt;/a&gt;\" Nicholas David, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20O%27Neal\"&gt;Alexander O'Neal&lt;/a&gt;, Andr\u00e9 Cymone, &lt;a href=\"Dez%20Dickerson\"&gt;Dez Dickerson&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Fink and The Roots drummer &lt;a href=\"Questlove\"&gt;Questlove&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Melvoin\"&gt;Wendy Melvoin&lt;/a&gt; appeared as the resident guitarist for the night's events.\nIn May 2013, Bobby Z joined &lt;a href=\"Prince%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; on stage during the closing two shows of Prince's whirlwind 3rdeyegirl tour. Both shows took place on the same night with Bobby taking over from Prince's drummer &lt;a href=\"Hannah%20Welton\"&gt;Hannah Welton-Ford&lt;/a&gt;. He sat in on both shows for one song. On both occasions it was \"&lt;a href=\"Purple%20Rain%20%28song%29\"&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/a&gt;\". In late May 2013, Bobby appeared alongside former bandmate &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Cymone\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Cymone&lt;/a&gt; on a web based chat show co-hosted by celebrity blogger Dr.Funkenberry where they both reminisced about their early days on the road with Prince. Bobby also mentioned that it was a thrill to be back onstage with Prince.\nCurrent life.\nBobby Z now hosts a radio show every Sunday on 96.3 K-TWIN in Minneapolis.\nEquipment.\nDrum kit with Prince in the 1980s:\nPersonal life.\nBobby's brothers are film maker &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20E.%20Rivkin\"&gt;Stephen E. Rivkin&lt;/a&gt; and fellow Minneapolis musician &lt;a href=\"David%20Z%20%28music%20producer%29\"&gt;David Z&lt;/a&gt;. He is married to his wife Vicki."
