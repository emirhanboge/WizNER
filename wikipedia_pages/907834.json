    "text": "Knocklyon () is a suburb of &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; in the administrative county of &lt;a href=\"South%20Dublin\"&gt;South Dublin&lt;/a&gt; within the traditional &lt;a href=\"County%20Dublin\"&gt;County Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland. Unlike many Dublin suburbs, Knocklyon was not developed around a village; rather it largely comprises modern housing built between the village of &lt;a href=\"Templeogue\"&gt;Templeogue&lt;/a&gt; and the former hamlet, now a suburb in its own right, of &lt;a href=\"Firhouse\"&gt;Firhouse&lt;/a&gt;. A number of old cottages and farmhouses along the Knocklyon Road attest to the area's rural past.\nEtymology.\nThe area has been known historically in 14th century scrolls as \"Cnocl\u00edn\", literally 'flax mountain'. Until recently, roadsigns in Knocklyon had an incorrect \"reverse anglicised\" translation, giving \"Lyon's hill\" or \"Cnoc Liamhna\", so for example the Irish-language wording on signs for Knocklyon Road showed \"B\u00f3thar Chnoc Liamhna\". The local authority have updated their translation based on a recommendations from the commissioned update on Irish placenames.\nLocation.\nKnocklyon is located among the southwestern suburbs of the city, in the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Wicklow%20Mountains\"&gt;Dublin Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and south of the line of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Dodder\"&gt;River Dodder&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered to the east and south by &lt;a href=\"Rathfarnham\"&gt;Rathfarnham&lt;/a&gt;, to the north by &lt;a href=\"Templeogue\"&gt;Templeogue&lt;/a&gt;, and to the west by &lt;a href=\"Firhouse\"&gt;Firhouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballycullen\"&gt;Ballycullen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"M50%20motorway%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;M50 motorway&lt;/a&gt; divides Knocklyon, with most of the suburb lying east of the motorway. &lt;a href=\"Housing%20estate\"&gt;Housing estate&lt;/a&gt;s to the east include Idrone, Knocklyon Avenue, Beverly, Dargle Wood, Coolamber, Knockcullen, Lansdowne, Delaford, Knockaire, Orlagh, Scholarstown Park, Woodfield and Templeroan. To the west of the M50 are estates such as Castlefield, Glenlyon, Glenvara and Woodstown. The western and eastern portions of the suburb are linked by the Firhouse Road, by the flyover at Junction 12 of the M50 motorway, and by a footbridge close to where the Old Knocklyon Road formerly met Ballycullen Road.\nPopulation.\nThe population figure cannot be isolated from published census data as Knocklyon is composed of Firhouse-Knocklyon &lt;a href=\"district%20electoral%20division\"&gt;district electoral division&lt;/a&gt; (DED) (population 39,602 in 2011), plus fractions of Ballyboden DED (57,085) and Firhouse-Ballycullen DED (77,773), not divided and published distinctly.\nAmenities.\nKnocklyon Shopping Centre contains a supermarket and other retail outlets. There are also two shopping areas in the Orlagh and Woodstown estates. Both are anchored by a supermarket and have a number of fast food take-aways shops, as well as beauty salons and childcare centres. There is also a local &lt;a href=\"Public%20houses%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;public house&lt;/a&gt;.\nA division of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%20Ambulance\"&gt;St. John Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; was established in 2010 which provides first aid training in the community.\nKnocklyon has a number of open spaces within its residential estates and along the &lt;a href=\"River%20Dodder\"&gt;River Dodder&lt;/a&gt;, including the home ground and playing pitches for both a &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Gaelic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; club (&lt;a href=\"Ballyboden%20St.%20Enda%27s%20GAA\"&gt;Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA&lt;/a&gt;) and a football club, Knocklyon United Football Club.\nSchools.\nSt. Colmcille's &lt;a href=\"National%20school%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;national school&lt;/a&gt; opened in September 1976. The school is the largest primary school in Ireland and one of the largest primary schools in Europe and educates 1,600 students and employs 80 teachers, 23 special needs assistants, and 11 ancillary staff.\nGaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna is an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt; that was established in September 1996 with 36 pupils. The school now teaches 234 children.\nSt. Colmcille's &lt;a href=\"Community%20school%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Community School&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Knocklyon Community School) has 700 secondary students and opened in September 2000.\nPrior to the construction of Knocklyon Community School the area was (and to some extent still is) served by &lt;a href=\"Templeogue%20College\"&gt;Templeogue College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terenure%20College\"&gt;Terenure College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sancta%20Maria%20College%2C%20Rathfarnham\"&gt;Sancta Maria College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Mac%20Dara%27s%20Community%20College\"&gt;Saint Mac Dara's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firhouse%20community%20college\"&gt;Firhouse Community School&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Religious%20of%20Christian%20Education\"&gt;Our Lady's Secondary School&lt;/a&gt; and Col\u00e1iste \u00c9anna C.B.S.\nReligion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Parish%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;Catholic Parish&lt;/a&gt; of Knocklyon was established in October 1974 under the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Columba\"&gt;Saint Colmcille&lt;/a&gt;. It is run for the &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Dublin%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29\"&gt;Dublin Archdiocese&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Carmelites\"&gt;Carmelite Order&lt;/a&gt;.
