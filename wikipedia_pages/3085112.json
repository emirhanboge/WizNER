    "text": "Grigore Alexandru Ghica or Ghika (1803 or 1807 \u2013 24 August 1857) was a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; between 14 October 1849, and June 1853, and again between 30 October 1854, and 3 June 1856. His wife was Helena, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sturdza%20family\"&gt;Sturdza family&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Sturdza\"&gt;Ioan Sturdza&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Prince of Moldavia from 1822 to 1828.\nBiography.\nEarly life and first rule.\nBorn sometime between 1800 and 1810, Grigore Alexandru was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Ghica%20family\"&gt;Ghica family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"boyars\"&gt;boyars&lt;/a&gt;, and a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Phanariotes\"&gt;Phanariotes&lt;/a&gt;. After being educated in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to his native country and rallied with the &lt;a href=\"Romantic%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; opposition to Prince &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sturdza\"&gt;Mihail Sturdza&lt;/a&gt; under the \"&lt;a href=\"Regulamentul%20Organic\"&gt;Regulamentul Organic&lt;/a&gt;\" regime. Following the &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;1848 Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and Sturdza's deposition, despite his political choices, with &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s approval, the &lt;a href=\"Sfatul%20boieresc\"&gt;Moldavian Divan&lt;/a&gt; appointed Ghica as ruler for a seven-year term (recognition from the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the country's other overseer, was obtained through the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Balta%20Liman\"&gt;Convention of Balta Liman&lt;/a&gt;).\nSoon after receiving the throne in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;, Ghica carried out a series of moderate reforms, and prepared to implement more radical ones. He was responsible for creating a corps of &lt;a href=\"Gendarmerie\"&gt;Gendarmes&lt;/a&gt; (3 April 1850), which was to serve as an embryo for the present-day &lt;a href=\"Jandarmeria%20Rom%C3%A2n%C4%83\"&gt;Romanian Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;. In 1851, he nominated the &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;n-born intellectual &lt;a href=\"August%20Treboniu%20Laurian\"&gt;August Treboniu Laurian&lt;/a&gt;, himself a noted supporter of &lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;ethnic Romanian&lt;/a&gt; nationalism, as Inspector of the Schools in Moldavia. Additionally, his rule relaxed &lt;a href=\"censorship\"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt;, and became noted for an increase in literary activities.\nGrigore Alexandru Ghica's program was ended by the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt;, when Russian troops occupied the &lt;a href=\"Danubian%20Principalities\"&gt;Danubian Principalities&lt;/a&gt; as a means to attack the Ottoman Empire. Deposed in June 1853, he went into exile in October, crossing into the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and settling in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. When occupying troops were forced to retreat the following year, and Russian influence remained marginal, he was allowed to regain his position, and attempted to fulfill his platform.\nSecond rule and reforms.\nAs such, Ghica ordered the &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism\"&gt;abolition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roma%20minority%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Romania\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;. This came at the end of a gradual process: since slaves owned by the state and the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; had been set free by Mihail Sturdza in 1844, the order applied to the sizable category of privately owned Roma. The legislative project was drafted by &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu\"&gt;Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petre%20Mavrogheni\"&gt;Petre Mavrogheni&lt;/a&gt;, and passed with the Divan's unanimous vote on 22 December 1855, providing compensation for all adult and able Roma, part of which was to be collected from former state-owned slaves. In the end, as the sums owed were threatening to drain state resources, payment was settled with &lt;a href=\"Government%20bond\"&gt;state bonds&lt;/a&gt; (while 264 boyars agreed to free their slaves at no expense to the state). As many as 30,000 Roma or as few as 5,000 gained their freedom as a direct result of the move.\nThe order was the direct consequence of a public scandal involving the family of &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Cantacuzino-Pa%C5%9Fcanu\"&gt;Dimitrie Cantacuzino-Pa\u015fcanu&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Moldavia's \"&lt;a href=\"logof%C4%83t\"&gt;logof\u0103t&lt;/a&gt;\" during the 1830s. Dimitrie's widow Profira had adopted and educated Dinc\u0103, a son of her husband's from an adulterous relationship with a Roma slave, who served the estate as a cook. As a result of his upbringing, Dinc\u0103 had emancipated himself and was even allowed access to French high-society, when he accompanied Profira Cantacuzino to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he made the acquaintance of a chambermaid, Cl\u00e9mentine, who became his fianc\u00e9e and agreed to accompany him back to Moldavia. Upon his return, Dinc\u0103's status as a slave was exposed \u2014 impressed by the situation, Ghica agreed to advocate his release, but met opposition from Profira Cantacuzino, who argued that Dinc\u0103 reminded her of her deceased husband, and stressed that she could not allow him to grow estranged. Confronted with the news and aware that he would not be allowed to marry a free woman, Dinc\u0103 shot his wife and then himself, an event which served to draw additional support for the abolitionist cause.\nGhica's overt approval of the nationalist program, which called for uniting Moldavia and Wallachia and implied measures to support \"&lt;a href=\"Partida%20Na%C5%A3ional%C4%83\"&gt;Partida Na\u0163ional\u0103&lt;/a&gt;\"'s activities, provoked the opposition of Austria and the Ottoman Empire. During the late years of his rule, he appointed several \"Partida Na\u0163ional\u0103\" representatives to government positions.\nIn 1856, Prince Grigore legislated an end to censorship and instituted &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20the%20press\"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt;. A notable cultural event during the later years of his rule was a debate over the authenticity of the \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20of%20Huru\"&gt;Chronicle of Huru&lt;/a&gt;\", a document which claimed to shed light on obscure events in Moldavian history, and which received ideological support from the anti-unionist &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Asachi\"&gt;Gheorghe Asachi&lt;/a&gt;. Ghica appointed a Commission of experts, comprising Laurian, Kog\u0103lniceanu, and &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Costache Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that the document was a forgery.\nLater years and suicide.\nAfter his term expired, Ghica left the country and moved to Paris. In his place, after a short hiatus, the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Porte\"&gt;Porte&lt;/a&gt; appointed a &lt;a href=\"Teodor%20Bal%C5%9F\"&gt;Teodor Bal\u015f&lt;/a&gt;, with the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Caimacam\"&gt;Caimacam&lt;/a&gt;\". A noted adversary of the unionist cause, Bal\u015f focused his attention on becoming titular Prince. Having retreated to his property in &lt;a href=\"Le%20M%C3%A9e-sur-Seine\"&gt;Le M\u00e9e-sur-Seine&lt;/a&gt;, the former ruler continued to advocate the union, which had by then been made more probable by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29\"&gt;1856 Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and, to this end, attempted to determine the &lt;a href=\"Second%20French%20Empire\"&gt;Second French Empire&lt;/a&gt; to issue formal approval for free and transparent elections to be carried out in Moldavia \u2014 annulling the electoral fraud carried out by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Vogoride\"&gt;Nicolae Vogoride&lt;/a&gt; (who had since replaced Bal\u015f). This brought him to the attention of anti-unionists, who began publicizing various inflammatory allegations in reference to Ghica. Feeling insulted by the arguments, Ghica also grew disenchanted by &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20III%20of%20France\"&gt;Napoleon III&lt;/a&gt;'s refusal to grant him an audience (despite the fact that, by then, the French monarch had chosen to endorse new Moldavian elections).\nHe committed suicide in his home. Shortly before this, he drafted his last will, which was introduced by the statement:\n\"I am the victim of a foul deed and cannot live any longer, although I know myself to be completely innocent. The day shall come when truth will be exposed. I await my enemies in front of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Judgment\"&gt;God's court&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nLegacy.\nJust two days after his death, Ottoman authorities agreed to overturn the elections sanctioned by Vogoride. When the Moldo-Wallachian union was effected by the 1859 double election of &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Ioan%20Cuza\"&gt;Alexandru Ioan Cuza&lt;/a&gt;, who reigned as \"&lt;a href=\"Domnitor\"&gt;Domnitor&lt;/a&gt;\", Ghica's law on censorship served as a model for new legislation, and was generalized throughout &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn recognition of his role in creating the &lt;a href=\"Jandarmeria%20Rom%C3%A2n%C4%83\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;, the School for Subordinate Officers in &lt;a href=\"Dr%C4%83g%C4%83%C5%9Fani\"&gt;Dr\u0103g\u0103\u015fani&lt;/a&gt; (originally located in &lt;a href=\"Bumbe%C5%9Fti-Jiu\"&gt;Bumbe\u015fti-Jiu&lt;/a&gt;) was named after him.\nA section &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Creang%C4%83\"&gt;Ion Creang\u0103&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"Amintiri din copil\u0103rie\", which details the Prince's visit to the school in &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgu%20Neam%C5%A3\"&gt;T\u00e2rgu Neam\u0163&lt;/a&gt; at a time when Creang\u0103 was a student there, contains an admiring portrait of Ghica (\"handsome in features and gentle\"), as well as a section of his speech on the occasion.\nGrigore Alexandru Ghica was the grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Ghika\"&gt;Vladimir Ghika&lt;/a&gt;, who was a victim of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian Communist regime&lt;/a&gt;."
