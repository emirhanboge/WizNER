    "text": "Lewisia nevadensis is a species of flowering plant in the family &lt;a href=\"Montiaceae\"&gt;Montiaceae&lt;/a&gt; known by the common name Nevada lewisia. It is native to much of the western United States, where it grows in moist mountain habitat, such as meadows. This is a small perennial herb growing from a &lt;a href=\"taproot\"&gt;taproot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"caudex\"&gt;caudex&lt;/a&gt; unit. It produces a basal rosette of several narrow, fingerlike to threadlike fleshy leaves up to 13 centimeters long. The &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; is a bundle of short stems a few centimeters tall each bearing a flower. The flower has 5 to 10 shiny white to pale pink petals each 1 to 2 centimeters long, pointed or with blunt tips. At the center are many &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s. This is sometimes grown as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt; suitable for &lt;a href=\"alpine%20climate\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rock%20garden\"&gt;rock garden&lt;/a&gt;s."
