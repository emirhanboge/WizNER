    "text": "The fez (, ), also called tarboosh (, derived from ), is a felt headdress in the shape of a short cylindrical peakless hat, usually red, and sometimes with a tassel attached to the top. The name \"fez\" refers to the Moroccan city of &lt;a href=\"Fez%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;, where the dye to colour the hat was extracted from &lt;a href=\"crimson\"&gt;crimson&lt;/a&gt; berries. The modern fez owes much of its popularity to the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20era\"&gt;Ottoman era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fez became a symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the early 19th century. In 1827, &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20II\"&gt;Mahmud II&lt;/a&gt; mandated the fez as a modern headdress for his new army, the &lt;a href=\"Asakir-i%20Mansure-i%20Muhammediye\"&gt;Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was inspired by the Ottoman naval command, who had previously returned from the &lt;a href=\"Maghreb\"&gt;Maghreb&lt;/a&gt; having embraced the style. In 1829, Mahmud issued new regulations mandating use of the fez by all civil and religious officials. The intention was to replace the &lt;a href=\"turban\"&gt;turban&lt;/a&gt;, which acted as a marker of identity and so divided rather than unified the population. The fez was subsequently outlawed in Turkey in 1925 as part of &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk%27s%20Reforms\"&gt;Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Turkish fez got its name from the Moroccan city of &lt;a href=\"Fes\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the crimson berry once used to dye the felt. The hat itself is either of ancient Greek, Moroccan or &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; origin. It was popular especially during the later period of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and its use spread throughout the empire.\nAccording to historian Jeremy Seal, the fez is Turkish in origin and was ordered by &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20II\"&gt;Mahmud II&lt;/a&gt; as a modern alternative to the turban that allowed &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; men to prostrate while praying.\n17th century, medieval Turkish historian &lt;a href=\"Evliya%20Celebi\"&gt;Evliya Celebi&lt;/a&gt; describes &lt;a href=\"Algerian%20people\"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt; men wearing the fez.\nInitially, the fez was a brimless red, white, or black &lt;a href=\"Bonnet%20%28headgear%29\"&gt;bonnet&lt;/a&gt; over which a turban was wrapped (similar to a wrapped &lt;a href=\"keffiyeh\"&gt;keffiyeh&lt;/a&gt;). Later the turban was eliminated, the bonnet shortened, and the color fixed to red. Praying while wearing a fez\u2014instead of a headdress with brim\u2014was easier because &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; put their heads to the ground during &lt;a href=\"Salah\"&gt;Salah&lt;/a&gt; (daily prayers).\nIn 1826, Sultan &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII\"&gt;Mahmud\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Auspicious%20Incident\"&gt;suppressed the Janissaries&lt;/a&gt; and began sweeping reforms of the military. The &lt;a href=\"Nizam-%C4%B1%20Cedid\"&gt;modernized military&lt;/a&gt; adopted Western style uniforms and, as headdresses, the fez with a cloth wrapped around it. In 1827, 50,000 fezzes were ordered from Tunis for the sultan's troops. In 1829 the Sultan ordered his civil officials to wear the plain fez, and banned the wearing of &lt;a href=\"turban\"&gt;turban&lt;/a&gt;s. The intention was to coerce the populace at large to update to the fez, and the plan was successful. This was a radically egalitarian measure, which replaced the elaborate &lt;a href=\"sumptuary%20law\"&gt;sumptuary law&lt;/a&gt;s that signaled rank, &lt;a href=\"millet%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, and occupation, foreshadowing the &lt;a href=\"Tanzimat\"&gt;Tanzimat&lt;/a&gt; reforms. Although tradesmen and artisans generally rejected the fez, it became a symbol of modernity throughout the Near East, inspiring similar decrees in other nations (such as &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in 1873).\nTo meet escalating demand, skilled fez makers were induced to immigrate from Tunisia to &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, where factories were established in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Ey%C3%BCp\"&gt;Ey\u00fcp&lt;/a&gt;. Styles soon multiplied, with nuances of shape, height, material, and hue competing in the market. The striking scarlet and merlot colors of the fez were initially achieved through an extract of &lt;a href=\"Cornus%20mas\"&gt;cornel&lt;/a&gt;. However, the invention of low-cost synthetic dyes soon shifted production of the hat to the factories of &lt;a href=\"Strakonice\"&gt;Strakonice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; (then in the Austrian Empire).\nThe 1908 &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20annexation%20of%20Bosnia-Herzegovina\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a &lt;a href=\"boycott\"&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; of Austrian goods, which became known as the \"Fez Boycott\" due to the near-monopoly the Austrians then held on production of the hat. Although the headdress survived, the year-long boycott brought the end of its universality in the Ottoman Empire as other styles became socially acceptable.\nSymbolism.\nThe fez was a symbol not only of Ottoman affiliation but also of religious adherence to Islam. It was also the main headdress for Christians and Jews during the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Jewish men wore the fez and referred to it by the &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; name \"Tarboush\", especially Arab-Jews (mostly &lt;a href=\"Egyptians\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrian\"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Palestinians\"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt;). In southern Asia, the fez had been adopted due to its links with the Ottoman Empire. \nThrough the 19th and early 20th centuries the fez was the preferred headwear for Christians and Muslims in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, which at the time was still mostly under Ottoman suzerainty. There were variations on the fez in the Balkan states, mainly involving the addition of religious symbols on the front. In semi-independent &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, a client state of the Ottoman Empire that enjoyed complete autonomy, its Orthodox citizens wore their fezzes with a Greek cross on the front. Supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20movement\"&gt;Illyrian movement&lt;/a&gt; among South Slavs, especially in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%28Habsburg%29\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, wore their fezzes with a &lt;a href=\"star%20and%20crescent\"&gt;star and crescent&lt;/a&gt; on the front irrespective of religion, believing that the symbol predated the introduction of Islam in the Balkans. In 1850, regulations in the newly-autonomous &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Principality of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; concerning uniforms of ministerial officers specified the wear of red fezzes displaying the &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Serbian coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, the fez came to be seen as part of an &lt;a href=\"Orientalism\"&gt;Oriental&lt;/a&gt; cultural identity. Seen as exotic and romantic in the west, it enjoyed a vogue as part of men's luxury smoking outfit in the United States and the United Kingdom around the turn of the 20th century. The fez had become so symbolic of tradition to the point that &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt; banned it in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; in 1925 as part of &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk%27s%20Reforms\"&gt;his modernizing reforms&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, the fez is worn by many, most prominently in Morocco. In Morocco, it became a more pronounced cultural symbol in the 20th-century against French dominance. It is still favoured among the royal court.\nMilitary use.\nA version of the fez was used as an &lt;a href=\"arming%20cap\"&gt;arming cap&lt;/a&gt; for the 1400\u20131700s version of the mail armour head protector (a round metal plate or skull-cap, around which hung a curtain of mail to protect the neck and upper shoulder). The red fez with blue tassel was the standard headdress of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Army\"&gt;Turkish Army&lt;/a&gt; from the 1840s until the introduction of a &lt;a href=\"khaki\"&gt;khaki&lt;/a&gt; service dress and peakless &lt;a href=\"sun%20helmet\"&gt;sun helmet&lt;/a&gt; in 1910. The only significant exceptions were cavalry and some artillery units who wore a &lt;a href=\"sheepskin\"&gt;lambskin&lt;/a&gt; hat with coloured cloth tops. &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Albania\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; levies wore a white version of the fez, resembling their traditional &lt;a href=\"qeleshe\"&gt;qeleshe&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; the fez was still worn by some naval reserve units and occasionally by soldiers when off duty. The &lt;a href=\"Evzones\"&gt;Evzones&lt;/a&gt; (light infantry) regiments of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Army\"&gt;Greek Army&lt;/a&gt; wore their own distinctive version of the fez from 1837 until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. It now survives in the parade uniform of the Presidential Guard in Athens.\nFrom the mid-19th century on, the fez was widely adopted as the headdress of locally recruited \"native\" soldiers among the various &lt;a href=\"colonial%20troops\"&gt;colonial troops&lt;/a&gt; of the world. The French North African regiments (&lt;a href=\"Zouave\"&gt;Zouave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tirailleurs\"&gt;Tirailleurs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spahis\"&gt;Spahis&lt;/a&gt;) wore wide, red fezzes with detachable tassels of various colours. It was an off-duty affectation of the Zouaves to wear their fezzes at different angles according to the regiment; French officers of North African units during the 1930s often wore the same fez as their men, with rank insignia attached. (Many volunteer Zouave regiments wore the French North African version of the fez during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.) The Libyan battalions and squadrons of the Italian colonial forces wore lower, red fezzes over white skull caps. &lt;a href=\"Somali%20people\"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrean&lt;/a&gt; regiments in Italian service wore high red fezzes with coloured tassels that varied according to the unit. German &lt;a href=\"askaris\"&gt;askaris&lt;/a&gt; in East Africa wore their fezzes with khaki covers on nearly all occasions.\nThe Belgian &lt;a href=\"Force%20Publique\"&gt;Force Publique&lt;/a&gt; in the Congo wore large and floppy red fezzes similar to those of the French Tirailleurs Senegalais and the Portuguese Companhias Indigenas. The British &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20African%20Rifles\"&gt;King's African Rifles&lt;/a&gt; (recruited in East Africa) wore high straight-sided fezzes in either red or black, while the &lt;a href=\"West%20African%20Frontier%20Force\"&gt;West African Frontier Force&lt;/a&gt; wore a low red version. The &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Army\"&gt;Egyptian Army&lt;/a&gt; wore the classic Turkish model until 1950. The &lt;a href=\"West%20India%20Regiment\"&gt;West India Regiment&lt;/a&gt; of the British Army wore a fez as part of its Zouave-style full dress until this unit was disbanded in 1928. The tradition is continued in the full dress of the band of the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Regiment\"&gt;Barbados Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, with a white turban wrapped around the base.\nWhile the fez was a colourful and picturesque item of uniform, it was in several ways an impractical headdress. If worn without a drab cover, it made the head a target for enemy fire, and it provided little protection from the sun. As a result, it was increasingly relegated to parade or off-duty wear by World War II. However, France's West African \"tirailleurs\" continued to wear a khaki-covered version in the field until about 1943. During the final period of colonial rule in Africa (approximately 1945 to 1962), the fez was seen only as a full-dress item in French, British, Belgian, Spanish, and Portuguese African units, being replaced by wide-brimmed hats or &lt;a href=\"forage%20cap\"&gt;forage cap&lt;/a&gt;s on other occasions. Colonial police forces, however, usually retained the fez as normal duty wear for indigenous personnel.\nPost-independence armies in Africa quickly discarded the fez as a colonial relic. It is, however, still worn by the ceremonial \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Guard%20of%20Senegal\"&gt;Garde Rouge&lt;/a&gt;\" in Senegal as part of their &lt;a href=\"Spahi\"&gt;Spahi&lt;/a&gt;-style uniform, and by the Italian &lt;a href=\"Bersaglieri\"&gt;Bersaglieri&lt;/a&gt; in certain orders of dress. The Bersaglieri adopted the fez as an informal headdress through the influence of the French Zouaves, with whom they served in the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt;. The Italian &lt;a href=\"Arditi\"&gt;Arditi&lt;/a&gt; in the First World War wore a black fez that later became a uniform item of the Mussolini &lt;a href=\"Fascist\"&gt;Fascist&lt;/a&gt; regime. The Spanish &lt;a href=\"Regulares\"&gt;Regulares&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Moorish) Tabors stationed in the Spanish &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ceuta\"&gt;Ceuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melilla\"&gt;Melilla&lt;/a&gt;, in North Africa, retain a parade uniform that includes the fez and white cloaks. Filipino units organised in the early days of U.S. rule briefly wore black fezzes, and officers serving with Muslim personnel of the Philippines Constabulary were authorized to wear this headdress from 1909.\nThe Liberian Frontier Force, although not a colonial force, wore fezzes until the 1940s.\n&lt;a href=\"Bosnian-Herzegovinian%20Infantry\"&gt;Bosnian infantry&lt;/a&gt; regiments in the former &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; Empire had been distinguished by wearing the fez until the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. They wore distinctive light blue or field grey uniforms, with a buckle showing an arm with a scimitar inside a shield as the symbol of Bosniak ethnicity. The primarily &lt;a href=\"Bosniak\"&gt;Bosniak&lt;/a&gt; Muslim &lt;a href=\"13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29\"&gt;13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar&lt;/a&gt;, which was recruited from Bosnia, used a red or field grey fez with Waffen SS cap insignia during the latter half of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo regiments of the Indian Army recruited from Muslim areas wore fezzes under British rule (although the turban was the nearly-universal headdress among Hindu and Muslim sepoys and sowars). A green fez was worn by the Bahawalpur Lancers of Pakistan as late as the 1960s.\nInternational use.\nIn the Middle East and North Africa.\nIt is believed that the chechia originated in Uzbekistan. Unlike the fez, the chechia is shorter and crafted from less stiff material, and is, therefore, softer and more pliable. By the 17th century that the chaouachis, or chechia makers, had spread to the capital &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;. By the 21st century, the procedure for making them remains the same, but the number of craftsmen who make them has decreased. While the market place in the &lt;a href=\"Souk%20Ech-Chaouachine\"&gt;Souk Ech-Chaouachine&lt;/a&gt;, hosted about 30,000 chaouachis during at its peak, that number had dropped by the 2010s to about 20, who struggle to keep the business alive. The modern chechia business is estimated to create jobs for over 2,000 artisans, with the remaining chechias are sold overseas, primarily to Libya, Nigeria, and Niger. Chechia colours vary by country. It is red in Tunisia, and lacks a tassel. In Libya, the chechia is normally black, except the Benghazi version, or \"chenna,\" which is also red and includes a tassel. In Morocco, and some parts of Tunisia, it can also be seen in white or grey.\nIn Southern Asia.\nThe fez appeared in the Nizam's rule when he visited Rome. The purpose of adopting this style was the VII Nizam, Nizam Osman Ali Khan had a mere height of 5 feet. He used this to look taller especially when meeting foreign deligations or on special occasions.\nThe fez is known as the \"Rumi Topi\", which means \"Roman Cap\" (by virtue of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; being seen as the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Rome\"&gt;successor state&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;). It is worn by some sections of the Muslim aristocracy of &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a symbol of the support for the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Caliphate\"&gt;Ottoman Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"British%20Indian%20Empire\"&gt;British Indian Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Khilafat%20Movement\"&gt;Khilafat Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Later, it became associated with some leaders of the &lt;a href=\"All-India%20Muslim%20League\"&gt;Muslim League&lt;/a&gt;, the political party that eventually created the country of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The veteran Pakistani politician &lt;a href=\"Nawabzada%20Nasrullah%20Khan\"&gt;Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few people in Pakistan who wore the fez until his death in 2003.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, the fez was frequently worn by the local Muslim &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Moor\"&gt;Sri Lankan Moor&lt;/a&gt; population. Despite its use declining in popularity, the fez is still used in traditional marriage ceremonies. It continues to be worn by \"\" Sufi path followers. The &lt;a href=\"songkok\"&gt;songkok&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is worn by the local &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Malays\"&gt;Sri Lankan Malays&lt;/a&gt;.\nA variation of the fez has been commonly worn in &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Maritime Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; since the 19th century when it was introduced by Muslims from &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Known as a &lt;a href=\"peci\"&gt;peci&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"songkok\"&gt;songkok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20language\"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt;, this variant is black in colour with a more ellipse shape and sometimes decorated with embroidery. The Philippine varieties tend to be colorful and highly decorated.\nUse by fraternal orders.\nMany &lt;a href=\"fraternal%20order\"&gt;fraternal order&lt;/a&gt;s are known for wearing fezzes. &lt;a href=\"Shriners\"&gt;Shriners&lt;/a&gt; are often depicted wearing a red fez; the headgear became official for the Shriners in 1872. Members of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Order%20of%20Alhambra\"&gt;International Order of Alhambra&lt;/a&gt; wear a white fez. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Order%20of%20Veiled%20Prophets%20of%20the%20Enchanted%20Realm\"&gt;Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm&lt;/a&gt; wear a black fez. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Peter%20Claver\"&gt;Knights of Peter Claver&lt;/a&gt; wear a blue fez. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Mystic%20Order%20of%20Samaritans\"&gt;Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans&lt;/a&gt; wear fezzes of various colors, based upon rank. The &lt;a href=\"Dramatic%20Order%20of%20the%20Knights%20of%20Khorassan\"&gt;Knights of Khorassan&lt;/a&gt; wear a navy blue fez. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World&lt;/a&gt; wear fezzes of various colors, based upon rank. The &lt;a href=\"Loyal%20Order%20of%20Moose\"&gt;Loyal Order of Moose&lt;/a&gt;'s second-degree body, the &lt;a href=\"Moose%20Legion\"&gt;Moose Legion&lt;/a&gt;, wear a purple fez. In the &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20and%20Hardy\"&gt;Laurel and Hardy&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20the%20Desert\"&gt;Sons of the Desert&lt;/a&gt;\" members of the fictional order of the same name wear fezzes, and consequently, so do those of the Laurel and Hardy &lt;a href=\"The%20Sons%20of%20the%20Desert\"&gt;International Appreciation Society&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself named after and modelled on the one seen in the film.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBritish comedian &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Cooper\"&gt;Tommy Cooper&lt;/a&gt; adopted the fez as part of his comic act while serving in Egypt during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. The hat went on to become Cooper's hallmark, and an icon of 20th century comedy. \"&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Who\"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;\" actor &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Smith%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Matt Smith&lt;/a&gt; wore the fez while playing the &lt;a href=\"Eleventh%20Doctor\"&gt;Eleventh Doctor&lt;/a&gt;, something repeated by other Doctors in later episodes."
