    "text": "The 9th Infantry Division Pasubio () was an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Italian Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Pasubio was classified as an auto-transportable division, meaning staff and equipment could be transported on cars and trucks, although not simultaneously. The division was formed as an infantry division in 1934, reorganized as auto-transportable division in 1939 and mobilized in August 1940. It was named for the battles on &lt;a href=\"Pasubio\"&gt;Pasubio&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Its 79th Infantry Regiment and 8th Artillery Regiment were made up of men from &lt;a href=\"Verona\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;, while the ranks of the 80th Regiment were filled with men from &lt;a href=\"Mantua\"&gt;Mantua&lt;/a&gt;. Its I CC.NN. Battalion \"Sabauda\" was made up of &lt;a href=\"Blackshirt\"&gt;Blackshirt&lt;/a&gt; volunteers from &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe division's lineage begins with the Brigade \"Roma\" established in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; on 1 November 1884 with the 79th and 80th infantry regiments.\nWorld War I.\nThe brigade fought on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 December 1926 the brigade assumed the name of IX Infantry Brigade with the 49th Infantry Regiment \"Parma\", 57th Infantry Regiment \"Abruzzi\", and 79th Infantry Regiment \"Roma\", while the &lt;a href=\"80th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%26quot%3BRoma%26quot%3B\"&gt;80th Infantry Regiment \"Roma\"&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded. The brigade was the infantry component of the 9th Territorial Division of Verona, which also included the 8th Artillery Regiment. In 1934 the division changed its name to 8th Infantry Division \"&lt;a href=\"Pasubio\"&gt;Pasubio&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1939 the division ceded the 49th Infantry Regiment \"Parma\" to the &lt;a href=\"49th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BParma%26quot%3B\"&gt;49th Infantry Division \"Parma\"&lt;/a&gt; and the 57th Infantry Regiment \"Abruzzi\" to the &lt;a href=\"10th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPiave%26quot%3B\"&gt;10th Infantry Division \"Piave\"&lt;/a&gt;, and received the re-raised 80th Infantry Regiment \"Roma\" from the &lt;a href=\"16th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPistoia%26quot%3B\"&gt;16th Infantry Division \"Pistoia\"&lt;/a&gt;. On the same date the 79th and 80th infantry regiments, and the 9th Artillery Regiment changed their names to \"Pasubio\".\nWorld War II.\nYugoslavia.\nThe Pasubio took part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in April 1941. First it was deployed at San Pietro del Carso (near modern &lt;a href=\"Pivka\"&gt;Pivka&lt;/a&gt;). By 16 April the division had overcome border defenses and reached the road to &lt;a href=\"Otocac\"&gt;Otocac&lt;/a&gt;. Closer to the end of war, it reached &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0ibenik\"&gt;\u0160ibenik&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Split%2C%20Croatia\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt; region where it participated in mop-up operations until 28 May 1941. After the end of the military operation in Yugoslavia, the Pasubio returned to Verona.\nSoviet Union.\nIn July 1941 the division was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Expeditionary%20Corps%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia&lt;/a&gt; and left Verona on 10 July 1941. It reached &lt;a href=\"Yampil%2C%20Vinnytsia%20Oblast\"&gt;Yampil&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dniester\"&gt;Dniester&lt;/a&gt; river on 6 August 1941. The first contact with the Soviet troops happened on 10 August 1941 near town of &lt;a href=\"Voznesensk\"&gt;Voznesensk&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Bug\"&gt;Southern Bug&lt;/a&gt; river. The Polyana village was reached by 12 August 1941. From 18 September 1941 until 26 September 1941 the Pasubio participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kiev%20%281941%29\"&gt;Battle of Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;, capturing and holding a bridgehead on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Dnieper\"&gt;Dnieper&lt;/a&gt; river. In October 1941 the Pasubio advanced by the route of Petrikovka-&lt;a href=\"Dnipropetrovsk\"&gt;Dnipropetrovsk&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Pavlohgrad\"&gt;Pavlohgrad&lt;/a&gt;-Ulyanivka(Kharkiv Oblast)-&lt;a href=\"Izium\"&gt;Izium&lt;/a&gt;. The Pasubio played a significant role in the capture of &lt;a href=\"Donetsk\"&gt;Stalino&lt;/a&gt; in October 1941, earning the praise of the German First Panzer Group's commander, General Ewald von Kleist. On 1 November 1941, the Pasubio attacked &lt;a href=\"Horlivka\"&gt;Horlivka&lt;/a&gt; and captured it after fierce fighting. The village of Nikitovka north of Horlivka fell soon thanks to a rapid advance. The division also contributed significantly to the capture of the Shazopetovka and Bulavyns'ke to the east of &lt;a href=\"Horlivka\"&gt;Horlivka&lt;/a&gt;. By that time, the Soviets forces increased to an extent where the Pasubio Division was forced to switch to the defense.\nIn January 1942 the Pasubio division helped German troops fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Izium\"&gt;Izium&lt;/a&gt; area, where it defeated a heavy Soviet attack near the village of Novaya Orlovka. By July 1942, Pasubio division fought near the town of &lt;a href=\"Krasnyi%20Luch\"&gt;Krasnyi Luch&lt;/a&gt;. In August, it reached the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;, where the right flank of the division was heavily attacked by Soviet forces on 20 August 1942. The attack was repelled in a few days, and the division's position on the Don remained unchanged until 11 December 1942, when the Soviets attacked with a large number of tanks. By 16 December 1942 the Pasubio's counter attacks had reestablished the initial positions, but by that time the collapse of the entire Italian front-line was already underway. Nearby the &lt;a href=\"52nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BTorino%26quot%3B\"&gt;52nd Infantry Division \"Torino\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BSforzesca%26quot%3B\"&gt;2nd Infantry Division \"Sforzesca\"&lt;/a&gt; had failed to maintain their positions, and therefore the Pasubio was forced to retreat to avoid encirclement. After a few days of retreat, the Pasubio was no longer able to maintain a coherent front-line and choose to only cover the roads of its retreat. On 25 December 1942, a rearguard of 600 men was surrounded in the village of Krasnoyarovka in Rostov Oblast and annihilated by 28 December 1942. The main body of the division had retreated with remnants of German units to the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Chertkovo%2C%20Rostov%20Oblast\"&gt;Chertkovo&lt;/a&gt; village, where they repelled several attacks starting from 23 December 1942. Afterwards the grueling march to first avoid, and then to break the Soviet encirclement, continued. On 15 January 1943 the fight to break through the Soviet lines started. Finally, the 2,000 men remaining of the division broke the encirclement on 17 January 1943 near the town of Belovodsk in &lt;a href=\"Luhansk%20Oblast\"&gt;Luhansk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pasubio's troops marched to &lt;a href=\"Stalino\"&gt;Stalino&lt;/a&gt; and the remnants of the division were repatriated in April 1943. The division received some minor existing units and was in the process of being reformed, when it was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Caserta\"&gt;Caserta&lt;/a&gt; for coastal defense duties. The division's garrisons there were the villages of Avena, &lt;a href=\"Grazzanise\"&gt;Grazzanise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sparanise\"&gt;Sparanise&lt;/a&gt;, and the town of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Capua%20Vetere\"&gt;Santa Maria Capua Vetere&lt;/a&gt;. The garrisons were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Achse\"&gt;invading German forces&lt;/a&gt; after the announcement of the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20of%20Cassibile\"&gt;Armistice of Cassibile&lt;/a&gt; on 8 September 1943.\nWhile the Pasubio was in the Soviet Union the division's &lt;a href=\"regimental%20depot\"&gt;regimental depot&lt;/a&gt;s in Italy raised the &lt;a href=\"104th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BMantova%26quot%3B\"&gt;104th Infantry Division \"Mantova\"&lt;/a&gt;: the 79th Infantry Regiment \"Pasubio\" raised the 113th Infantry Regiment \"Mantova\", the 80th Infantry Regiment \"Pasubio\" raised the 114th Infantry Regiment \"Mantova\", and the 8th Artillery Regiment \"Pasubio\" raised the 121st Motorized Artillery Regiment \"Mantova\".\nOrganization.\nWhen the division was deployed to the Soviet Union it consisted of the following units:\nAfter the division's return from the campaign in the Soviet Union it was assigned already existing minor support units to speed up the process of reforming the division:\nDuring this process the division's engineer units were merged into the newly formed XXIX Mixed Engineer Battalion.\nMilitary honors.\nFor their conduct during the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20participation%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Italian campaign in the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Italy\"&gt;President of Italy&lt;/a&gt; awarded the 79th Infantry Regiment \"Pasubio\" and the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Artillery%20Regiment%20%26quot%3BPasubio%26quot%3B\"&gt;8th Artillery Regiment \"Pasubio\"&lt;/a&gt; Italy's highest military honor, the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Medal%20of%20Military%20Valour\"&gt;Gold Medal of Military Valour&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"80th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%26quot%3BPasubio%26quot%3B\"&gt;80th Infantry Regiment \"Pasubio\"&lt;/a&gt; was awarded two Gold Medals of Military Valour - the only line infantry regiment so honored during the entire conflict.\nCommanding officers.\nThe division's commanding officers were:"
