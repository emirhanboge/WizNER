    "text": "The Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center (DCHC) is a component of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;. It is mandated to manage, develop and execute &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"counterintelligence\"&gt;counterintelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human%20intelligence%20%28espionage%29\"&gt;human intelligence&lt;/a&gt; activities worldwide; it's also responsible for oversight for training, doctrine, policy, &lt;a href=\"Information%20Technology%20Architecture\"&gt;information technology architecture&lt;/a&gt;, planning and &lt;a href=\"career%20management\"&gt;career management&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe DCHC absorbed many functions and authorities of the &lt;a href=\"Counterintelligence%20Field%20Activity\"&gt;Counterintelligence Field Activity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Support%20Branch\"&gt;Strategic Support Branch&lt;/a&gt;, which were disestablished simultaneously with the DCHC's establishment. Despite the counterintelligence component of its work, the center has no &lt;a href=\"law%20enforcement\"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; authority.\nIn 2012, Defense Secretary &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Panetta\"&gt;Leon Panetta&lt;/a&gt; and Director of National Intelligence &lt;a href=\"James%20Clapper\"&gt;James Clapper&lt;/a&gt; announced the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Clandestine%20Service\"&gt;Defense Clandestine Service&lt;/a&gt;. This has been seen as an upgrading and rebranding of DIA's current HUMINT capabilities."
