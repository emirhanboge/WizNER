    "text": "TFF 2. Lig (Turkish Football Federation Second League) or \"TFF 2. Lig\" (in Turkish), is the third level in the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Turkish football league system&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in the 2001\u201302 season with the name of \"Turkish Second League Category B\" as a continuation of the then second level division. In the 2005\u201306 season the name of the league was changed to \"Lig B\". Since the 2007\u201308 season the league's current name is used along with sponsor names.\nTurkish Second Football League (in Turkish: \"T\u00fcrkiye \u0130kinci Futbol Ligi\" or shortly \"\u0130kinci Lig\" or \"2. Lig\") is a defunct &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in Turkey. It was the second level division in Turkish football since its foundation in 1963\u201364 until the formation of the new league system in 2001\u201302. The Second Football League was divided into two categories in the 2001\u201302 season: Category A and Category B. Since 2007\u201308 Category A has continued as the &lt;a href=\"TFF%20First%20League\"&gt;TFF First League&lt;/a&gt; and Category B has continued as the TFF Second League.\nLeague status.\nIn the 2009\u201310 season the league contained 55 clubs spread out over 4 groups of 11 or 12 teams. The league is played over two rounds. In the first round, ten teams in five groups play with other teams in their group, like a regular season. Top two teams of each group qualify to the \"play-off group\". They form a play-off league (consisting of ten teams) and play a regular season starting with zero points. The remaining eight teams in each group keep their points and they play again with each other. These new eight-teamed groups are called \"classifying groups\". The top two teams in each play-off group are &lt;a href=\"Promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"TFF%20First%20League\"&gt;TFF First League&lt;/a&gt;. The three teams classified as third to fifth in each play-off group join the extra play-offs with top teams from each of the five classifying groups. These eight teams play a knockout competition (in a neutral venue) to determine the last team to be promoted. The bottom three teams of the classifying groups are &lt;a href=\"Promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegated&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"TFF%20Third%20League\"&gt;TFF Third League&lt;/a&gt;. The top four clubs from the Promotion Group of the TFF Third League are then promoted to the TFF Second League, while eight others play in a play-off.\nIn the 2010\u201311 season the league was played with 36 teams in two groups, white and red. The winners of each group are directly promoted to the \"1. Lig\" (&lt;a href=\"TFF%20First%20League\"&gt;TFF First League&lt;/a&gt;). In each group 2nd through 5th teams compete in the play-off with the respective team in the other group to determine the finalists. The finalists play a single game to determine the third team to be promoted. The bottom three teams in each group are relegated to the \"3. Lig\" (&lt;a href=\"TFF%20Third%20League\"&gt;TFF Third League&lt;/a&gt;).\nLeague history.\n1963\u201364 Turkish Second Football League.\nLeague was founded in 1963\u201364 as a single group with 13 teams.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1964\u201365 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1965\u201366 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1966\u201367 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1967\u201368 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1968\u201369 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1969\u201370 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1970\u201371 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1971\u201372 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1972\u201373 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1973\u201374 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1974\u201375 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1975\u201376 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1976\u201377 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1977\u201378 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1978\u201379 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1979\u201380 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1980\u201381 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1981\u201382 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1982\u201383 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1983\u201384 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1984\u201385 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1985\u201386 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1986\u201387 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1987\u201388 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1988\u201389 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1989\u201390 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1990\u201391 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1991\u201392 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1992\u201393 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1993\u201394 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1994\u201395 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1995\u201396 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1996\u201397 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1997\u201398 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1998\u201399 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n1999\u20132000 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\n2000\u201301 Turkish Second Football League.\nPromotion and relegation:\nSource: Cem Pekin Archives and TFF and mackolik.com.\nPast promotion since 2001\u201302.\nRegional Group System\nPromotion\u2013Classification Group System\nDual Group System\nPast relegation since 2001\u201302.\nRegional Group System\nPromotion\u2013Classification Group System\nDual Group System"
