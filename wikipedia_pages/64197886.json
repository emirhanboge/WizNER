    "text": "Hypogymnia occidentalis, commonly known as the lattice tube lichen, is a species of &lt;a href=\"foliose%20lichen\"&gt;foliose lichen&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Parmeliaceae\"&gt;Parmeliaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It is found in North America, where it grows on the lower trunks of &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly &lt;a href=\"Douglas-fir\"&gt;Douglas-fir&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Hypogymnia occidentalis\" was &lt;a href=\"species%20description\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a new species by Lawrence Pike in 1982. The &lt;a href=\"type%20%28biology%29\"&gt;type&lt;/a&gt; of the species is based on a collection made in Big Canyon, &lt;a href=\"Wallowa%20County\"&gt;Wallowa County&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;), which was found by botanist &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Perry%20Sheldon\"&gt;Edmund Perry Sheldon&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. The specimen was labeled as \"enteromorpha\", but as the authors explain, that name had been \"applied indiscriminately to vitally every nonseridiate \"Hypogymnia\" species in North America at some time.\"\nIt is commonly known as \"lattice tube lichen\".\nDescription.\nThe &lt;a href=\"thallus\"&gt;thallus&lt;/a&gt; of \"Hypogymnia occidentalis\", usually tightly pressed to its substrate, is made of small lobes (typically less than 3\u00a0wide). Although &lt;a href=\"sorelia\"&gt;sorelia&lt;/a&gt; is lacking from the thallus surface, there are small, rounded lobules extending from the sides of the lobes. The lichen contains &lt;a href=\"atranorin\"&gt;atranorin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"physodic%20acid\"&gt;physodic acid&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hypogymnia%20rugosa\"&gt;Hypogymnia rugosa&lt;/a&gt;\" is somewhat similar in appearance to \"H.\u00a0occidentalis\", but the former has broader lobes, does not have side lobules, and contains &lt;a href=\"hypoprotocetraric%20acid\"&gt;hypoprotocetraric acid&lt;/a&gt;.\nHabitat and distribution.\n\"Hypogymnia occidentalis\" is a common species in the &lt;a href=\"Cascade%20Mountains\"&gt;Cascade Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the northern &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountain\"&gt;Rocky Mountain&lt;/a&gt; area of the United States and Canada; its northern range extend to &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. It often grows on the lower trunks of &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly &lt;a href=\"Douglas-fir\"&gt;Douglas-fir&lt;/a&gt;, and is found at elevations ranging from sea level up to . It prefers trees in open or shaded forests, and is rarely found along the coast."
