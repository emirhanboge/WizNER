    "text": "Electoral district no. 1 () is one of the 12 &lt;a href=\"multi-member\"&gt;multi-member&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20districts%20of%20Estonia\"&gt;electoral districts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Riigikogu\"&gt;Riigikogu&lt;/a&gt;, the national &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. The electoral district was established in 1995 following the re-organisation of the electoral districts in &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;. It is conterminous with the districts of &lt;a href=\"Haabersti\"&gt;Haabersti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kristiine\"&gt;Kristiine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P%C3%B5hja-Tallinn\"&gt;P\u00f5hja-Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; in Tallinn. The district currently elects 10 of the 101 members of the Riigikogu using the &lt;a href=\"Open%20list\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"party-list%20proportional%20representation\"&gt;party-list proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"electoral%20system\"&gt;electoral system&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2019 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; it had 85,469 registered electors.\nElectoral system.\nElectoral district no. 1 currently elects 10 of the 101 members of the Riigikogu using the &lt;a href=\"Open%20list\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"party-list%20proportional%20representation\"&gt;party-list proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"electoral%20system\"&gt;electoral system&lt;/a&gt;. The allocation of seats is carried out in three stages. In the first stage, any individual candidate, regardless of whether they are a party or independent candidate, who receives more votes than the district's simple quota (&lt;a href=\"Hare%20quota\"&gt;Hare quota&lt;/a&gt;: valid votes in district/number of seats allocated to district) is elected via a personal mandate. In the second stage, district mandates are allocated to parties by dividing their district votes by the district's simple quota. Only parties that reach the 5% national &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20threshold\"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; compete for district mandates and any personal mandates won by the party are subtracted from the party's district mandates. Prior to 2003 if a party's surplus/remainder votes was equal to or greater than 75% of the district's simple quota it received one additional district mandate. Any unallocated district seats are added to a national pool of compensatory seats. In the final stage, compensatory mandates are calculated based on the national vote and using a modified &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt;. Only parties that reach the 5% national threshold compete for compensatory seats and any personal and district mandates won by the party are subtracted from the party's compensatory mandates. Though calculated nationally, compensatory mandates are allocated at the district level.\nSeats.\nSeats allocated to electoral district no. 1 by the National Electoral Committee of Estonia at each election was as follows:\nElection results.\nDetailed.\n2019.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2019 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 3 March 2019:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n2015.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2015 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 1 March 2015:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n2011.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2011 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 6 March 2011:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n2007.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2007 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 4 March 2007:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n2003.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2003 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 2 March 2003:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n1999.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1999 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 7 March 1999:\nThe following candidates were elected:\n1995.\nResults of the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Estonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1995 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 5 March 1995:\nThe following candidates were elected:"
