At the time of the finals Djokovic was ranked No. 1 and Federer at No. 2. This encounter was their third meeting in a Grand Slam final, when the last two previous were split between the two at the &lt;a href=\"2007%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;2007 US Open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2014%20Wimbledon%20Championships\"&gt;2014 Wimbledon Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Federer got the first break of serve in the match, during the first set, yet Djokovic quickly broke back leveling the match. When Djokovic was serving to remain in the first set, he had to fend off two set points from Federer, which he eventually got the set into a tiebreak, and it was a lopsided tiebreak that sent Djokovic up one set to none. The second set was a closely fought affair, but was decided to Federer's edge in the tiebreak. The last two sets were rather uneventful in the spectrum of the match because Djokovic got the breaks of serve, allowing him to win his third Wimbledon title, and second in a row. This put Djokovic eighth on the all-time list of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Grand%20Slam%20men%27s%20singles%20champions%23Grand%20Slam\"&gt;Men's Grand Slam singles champions&lt;/a&gt;, and putting him fifth during the Open Era. He now possesses as many &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Wimbledon%20gentlemen%27s%20singles%20champions%23Multiple%20champions\"&gt;Wimbledon singles titles&lt;/a&gt;, as his coach &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Becker\"&gt;Boris Becker&lt;/a&gt; won in his career.\nLadies' Singles.\nThis was their first encounter in a Grand Slam final, whilst all of the past meetings, occurred in Grand Slam events, from the first-time playing each other at the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2013 Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Serena%20Williams\"&gt;Serena Williams&lt;/a&gt; won the match in two sets, during this second round match. Their next contest occurred, at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2014 French Open&lt;/a&gt; in the second round, yet this time around &lt;a href=\"Garbi%C3%B1e%20Muguruza\"&gt;Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza&lt;/a&gt;, turned the tables to with the match in two sets. The third tie came, at the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2015 Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;, and it went three sets in a fourth round encounter, to the eventual victory by Serena in three sets. This bout would be their fourth meeting, and it got off to a rocky start by Serena, who served up three double faults, in order to get broken, during the first game of the match. Muguruza would get out to a four games to two advantage, when Williams held serve, and let out a \"Come On\". This rallied the twenty-time Grand Slam champion to win the first set, 6\u20134, when she broke the serve of Muguruza. Serena would get off to a fast start, during the second set, that she ended up getting breaks of serve from Muguruza in the fourth and sixth games of the set, to go up to a five games to one advantage. The momentous meaning the match held, for Williams ended up hitting her, when she had two bad service games, getting broken, letting Muguruza to come back to a five games to four set. This allowed Muguruza, the opportunity to serve in an attempt to stay in the match and set, yet she quickly got down in a love\u201340 hole, which she could not escape. The victory gave Serena her second \"Serena Slam\", and that was with the &lt;a href=\"2014%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2014 US Open&lt;/a&gt; win counted from the previous year. This victory was her twenty-first Grand Slam singles title, putting her one behind &lt;a href=\"Steffi%20Graf\"&gt;Steffi Graf&lt;/a&gt; in the Open Era of tennis, and three behind the all-time record held by &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Court\"&gt;Margaret Court&lt;/a&gt;. The win meant she became the oldest women's singles Grand Slam champion in the Open Era of tennis, besting the mark previously set by &lt;a href=\"Martina%20Navratilova\"&gt;Martina Navratilova&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithdrawals.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main tournament, but withdrew with injuries."
