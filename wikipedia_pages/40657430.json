The Department for Education found that Egglescliffe school was at fault as it failed to properly record bullying incidents against the victim. The Department for Educations finding said \"The headteacher also confirms that no incident forms had been completed for 12 months. No evidence has been provided to confirm that any of the incidents that this pupil reported were recorded using the Eportal or incident form methods.

The prizes, each worth \u00a370,000, are awarded to outstanding scholars who have made a substantial contribution to their particular field of study, recognised at an international level and where the expectation is that their greatest achievement is yet to come. In October 2017 Professor Levan announced (at an international press conference in Munich) discovery of a neutron star 'kilonova' having detected synchronous gravitational waves and optical signals. This has been heralded as all but conclusive evidence for gravitational radiation. Andrew was leader of the Hubble Space Telescope team for this project which involved collaboration between observers from 18 countries."
