    "text": "Straight Shooter is the second studio album by the &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hard%20rock\"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Supergroup%20%28music%29\"&gt;supergroup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Company\"&gt;Bad Company&lt;/a&gt;. The album was released on April 2, 1975, a month after the release of the album's first single, \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Lovin%27%20Gone%20Bad\"&gt;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&lt;/a&gt;\", and four months before the second single, \"&lt;a href=\"Feel%20Like%20Makin%27%20Love%20%28Bad%20Company%20song%29\"&gt;Feel Like Makin' Love&lt;/a&gt;\" (see &lt;a href=\"1975%20in%20music\"&gt;1975 in music&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe album reached number 3 in the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; and the US &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20200\"&gt;\"Billboard\" 200&lt;/a&gt;. It was certified gold (500,000 units sold) by the &lt;a href=\"Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; a month after its release. The album was remastered and re-released in 1994.\n&lt;a href=\"Mick%20Ralphs\"&gt;Mick Ralphs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Kirke\"&gt;Simon Kirke&lt;/a&gt; stated on \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Studio%20%28radio%20show%29\"&gt;In the Studio&lt;/a&gt;\" (which devoted an episode to \"Straight Shooter\") that the track \"Shooting Star\" (written by lead singer &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Rodgers\"&gt;Paul Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;) was lyrically inspired by the drug and alcohol-related deaths of &lt;a href=\"Jimi%20Hendrix\"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Janis%20Joplin\"&gt;Janis Joplin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Morrison\"&gt;Jim Morrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn June 1974, Bad Company released their &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Company%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled debut album&lt;/a&gt;. Three months later, the band and &lt;a href=\"Audio%20engineer\"&gt;recording engineer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Nevison\"&gt;Ron Nevison&lt;/a&gt; recorded at least eight songs at &lt;a href=\"Clearwell%20Castle\"&gt;Clearwell Castle&lt;/a&gt; in Gloucestershire, England. Sometime later Nevison &lt;a href=\"Mix%20engineer\"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; the songs for \"Straight Shooter\" at Air Studios in London. The sleeve for the album was designed by &lt;a href=\"Hipgnosis\"&gt;Hipgnosis&lt;/a&gt;, who also designed their debut album.\nThe first single from the album, \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Lovin%27%20Gone%20Bad\"&gt;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&lt;/a&gt;\", was released in March 1975 and reached No. 36 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. The album was released in April. The album's final single \"&lt;a href=\"Feel%20Like%20Makin%27%20Love%20%28Bad%20Company%20song%29\"&gt;Feel like Makin' Love&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in August and reached No. 10 on the Hot 100.\nCritical reception.\n\"Straight Shooter\" received different reviews from different music critics. Gautam Baksi's review of the album for &lt;a href=\"Allmusic\"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; said that the album's popularity was attributed to the acoustic ballads \"Shooting Star\" and \"Feel like Makin' Love\", while the two songs written by Simon Kirke\u2014\"Anna\" and \"Weep No More\"\u2014as well as the album not having enough supporting songs and follow-up singles, were what made the album less successful than its predecessor. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Christgau\"&gt;Robert Christgau&lt;/a&gt; felt that although \"Straight Shooter\" was better than its predecessor, it should not be labelled &lt;a href=\"hard%20rock\"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; because Paul Rodgers did not have a strong voice, which is needed to be a rock singer. Ed Naha's feeling of the album, as stated in \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, was much more favourable than Christgau's. Naha thought that, with their second album, Bad Company was proving that they would not end up like &lt;a href=\"Mott%20the%20Hoople\"&gt;Mott the Hoople&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20%28band%29\"&gt;Free&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"King%20Crimson\"&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;\u2014bands that Bad Company's members used to be part of. Naha also thought that Simon Kirke's \"Anna\" was as bad as it was when it was first recorded, but that \"Weep No More\" showed that he was progressing as a writer, while Boz Burrell was also making progress on the bass."
