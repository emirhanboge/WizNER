    "text": "Peru Olympic football team (also known as Peru under-23, Peru U23) represents &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; in international &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competitions in &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20event\"&gt;multi-sport event&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt;. The selection is limited to players under the age of 23, except three overage players. The team is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Peruvian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FPF).\nPeru has participated in two &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Olympic football tournament&lt;/a&gt;s, one &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;Pan American football tournament&lt;/a&gt;, and 7 &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Bolivarian%20Games\"&gt;Bolivarian football tournament&lt;/a&gt;s under this category.\nThe squad requirements to participate in the Summer Olympics has changed multiple times through the history of the competition. Since 1992, squads for &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Football at the Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; have been restricted to three players over the age of 23 with similar changes occurring in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%20Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. The achievements of such teams are not usually included in the statistics of the international team.\nHistory.\n1936 Summer Olympics.\nPeru qualified the Olympics for its first time in 1936, after finishing third in the &lt;a href=\"1935%20South%20American%20Championship\"&gt;1935 South American Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Argentina and Uruguay, who had finished ahead, refuse to participate because of economic issues.\nAmong the line of players featured in this first participation of the \"Blanquirroja\" were &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Villanueva\"&gt;Alejandro Villanueva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teodoro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Teodoro Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Valdivieso\"&gt;Juan Valdivieso&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adelfo%20Magallanes\"&gt;Adelfo Magallanes&lt;/a&gt;. The Peruvian players, after arriving in Germany via an Italian ship, were awestruck by the modern stadiums and the German idolatry of &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. The first match against &lt;a href=\"Finland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; was played on August 6, 1936, and was won with great ease by the Peruvians with a 7-3 result. Peru's next match was against &lt;a href=\"Austria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals. The match was highly contested, and the game went into overtime where the Peruvians tied against the Austrians after being two goals behind. Peru scored 5 goals during overtime, of which 3 were nullified by the referee, and won by a final score of 4-2.\nThe Austrians demanded a rematch on the grounds that Peruvian fans had stormed the field, and because the field did not meet the requirements for a football game. Austria further claimed that the Peruvian players had manhandled the Austrian players and that spectators, one holding a revolver, had \"swarmed down on the field.\" Peru was notified of this situation, and they attempted to go to the assigned meeting but were delayed by a German parade. At the end, the Peruvian defense was never heard, and the Olympic Committee and &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; sided with the Austrians. The rematch was scheduled to be taken under close grounds on August 10, and later rescheduled to be taken on August 11.\nAs a sign of protest against these actions, which the Peruvians deemed as insulting and &lt;a href=\"discriminatory\"&gt;discriminatory&lt;/a&gt;, the complete Olympic delegations of Peru and &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; left Germany. Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Mexico expressed their solidarity with Peru. Michael Dasso, a member of the Peruvian Olympic Committee, stated: \"We've no faith in European athletics. We have come here and found a bunch of merchants.\" The game was awarded to Austria by default. In Peru, angry crowds protested against the decisions of the Olympic Committee by tearing down an Olympic flag, throwing stones at the German consulate, refusing to load German vessels in the docks of &lt;a href=\"Callao\"&gt;Callao&lt;/a&gt;, and listening to inflammatory speeches which included President &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Benavides%20Larrea\"&gt;Oscar Benavides Larrea&lt;/a&gt;'s mention of \"the crafty Berlin decision.\" To this day, it is not known with certainty what exactly happened in Germany, but it is popularly believed that &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; authorities might have had some involvement in the situation.\n1960 Summer Olympics.\nAfter 24 years, Peru once again qualified for the football tournament at the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome&lt;/a&gt; with their U-23 football team. It defeated &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; in the two-leg play-off round by 6-0 in &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; and then by 3-2 in &lt;a href=\"Montevideo\"&gt;Montevideo&lt;/a&gt;. The five play-off winners faced each other in a special tournament held in Lima in April 1960. \"Los Incas\" finished third ahead of &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suriname%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt; and thus qualified for the tournament in Rome.\nIn their first match of the tournament, Peru started out with a surprise as &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Uribe\"&gt;Angel Uribe&lt;/a&gt; scored a 1st-minute goal against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Peru would go on to lose 2-1 against the French, and were later beaten by &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; in a result of 6-2, with only &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20%28footballer%20born%201941%29\"&gt;Alberto Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt; scoring goals for the \"Blanquirroja\". Their last match was against &lt;a href=\"India%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, which was a comfortable 3-1 score in favor of the Peruvians with goals by &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Nieri\"&gt;Nicolas Nieri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Iwasaki\"&gt;Thomas Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeru has not qualified again to the tournament since 1960, but were close to qualifying again in the 1964 and 1980 &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL%20Men%20Pre-Olympic%20Tournament\"&gt;CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament&lt;/a&gt;s.\n2015 Pan American Games.\nAn official multi-sport event squad was created once again for the first time since the 1960 Summer Olympics in 2015 for Peru's first participation in the Pan American football tournament held in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Peru had qualified to this tournament once before in 2007. &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt; only accepted to play with Under-17 teams that year (qualified through the &lt;a href=\"2007%20South%20American%20Under-17%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;2007 South American Under-17 Football Championship&lt;/a&gt;), since the Under-20 teams had to participate in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup\"&gt;U-20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. Peru declined to participate because the &lt;a href=\"Peru%20national%20under-17%20football%20team\"&gt;Under-17 team&lt;/a&gt; preferred to play friendlies in Asia in preparation of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Cup\"&gt;U-17 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href=\"Bolivia%20national%20under-17%20football%20team\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; took its place.\nThus Peru qualified once again in 2015 via the &lt;a href=\"2015%20South%20American%20U-20%20Championship\"&gt;2015 South American U-20 Championship&lt;/a&gt;. That year the top three teams in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20South%20American%20U-20%20Championship%23Final%20stage\"&gt;final stage&lt;/a&gt; of the tournament qualified to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament\"&gt;2016 Olympic tournament&lt;/a&gt; and the bottom three to the 2015 Pan American tournament of which Peru finished 5th.\nThe team's first game was against &lt;a href=\"Panama%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; on July 12. Panama put themselves ahead via &lt;a href=\"Jorman%20Aguilar\"&gt;Jorman Aguilar&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the first half. Peru then equalized the score through a goal by &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Maldonado%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Gonzalo Maldonado&lt;/a&gt; twelve minutes later. The deadlock was broken in the 90th minute when &lt;a href=\"Elsar%20Rodas\"&gt;Elsar Rodas&lt;/a&gt; committed a foul against the Panamanian &lt;a href=\"Cecilio%20Waterman\"&gt;Cecilio Waterman&lt;/a&gt; who was awarded a penalty that was converted by &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Escobar\"&gt;Fidel Escobar&lt;/a&gt; for a final score of 2\u20131. The second game was against &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20Olympic%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; with a final score of 4\u20130 with goals of &lt;a href=\"Luan%20Garcia\"&gt;Luan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20da%20Silveira%20da%20Silva\"&gt;Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B4mulo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Pacheco%20da%20Silva\"&gt;R\u00f4mulo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dod%C3%B4%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201994%29\"&gt;Dod\u00f4&lt;/a&gt;. This was enough to mathematically eliminate Peru out of the tournament before its third game against &lt;a href=\"Canada%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. During that game &lt;a href=\"Elsar%20Rodas\"&gt;Elsar Rodas&lt;/a&gt; scored the first and then &lt;a href=\"Manjrekar%20James\"&gt;Manjrekar James&lt;/a&gt; scored an &lt;a href=\"Own%20goal%23Association%20football\"&gt;own goal&lt;/a&gt; in the second half for a final 0\u20132 against the locals.\n2019 Pan American Games.\nPeru qualified to the 2019 tournament as host. It lost its first game by 2\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20Olympic%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;. Peru's second game was against &lt;a href=\"Honduras%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; who scored two goals in &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; of the game for a 2\u20132 draw. Peru's two goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Quevedo\"&gt;Kevin Quevedo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Guivin\"&gt;Jordan Guivin&lt;/a&gt;. On the last match day, Uruguay defeated Honduras by 3\u20130 which would qualify Peru the second round of the tournament if it was able to defeat Jamaica. In the end Jamaica defeated Peru with two goals in the second half, relegating Peru to the 7th place match against &lt;a href=\"Ecuador%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. There, a final score of 1\u20131 forced both teams to decide the match in penalties which Peru won by 4\u20132 to finish 7th of eight teams.\nBolivarian Games.\nThe Bolivarian Games (Spanish: \"Juegos Bolivarianos\") are a regional &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20event\"&gt;multi-sport event&lt;/a&gt; held in honor of &lt;a href=\"Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar\"&gt;Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar&lt;/a&gt;, and organized by the &lt;a href=\"ODEBO\"&gt;Bolivarian Sports Organization&lt;/a&gt; (\"Organizaci\u00f3n Deportiva Bolivariana\", ODEBO). The games' football tournament has changed category multiple times during the history of the competition with full national teams participating\nonly on the first edition in &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201938%20Bolivarian%20Games\"&gt;1938&lt;/a&gt;. At times the competition was limited to only amateur sides or youth teams. In 1985 the tournament was played by Under-20 sides. Since 1993 the football tournament is played by U-17 national teams.\nPeru won the first tournament which it counts as part of the accomplishments of the &lt;a href=\"Peru%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;senior team&lt;/a&gt;.
