    "text": "Clifton DeBerry (September 18, 1923 \u2013 March 24, 2006) was an American &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; and two-time candidate for &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first black American in the 20th century to be chosen by a political party as its nominee for president.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nClifton DeBerry was born in September 1923 in &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Springs%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Holly Springs, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. He worked as a house painter and was a &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;ist.\nIn the 1940s, DeBerry left his native South and moved to &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked in a factory owned by &lt;a href=\"International%20Harvester\"&gt;International Harvester&lt;/a&gt;. He became active in the Farm Equipment Workers Union and joined the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20USA\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. DeBerry grew critical of the official Communist movement, and in 1953 he joined the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Trotskyist\"&gt;Trotskyist&lt;/a&gt; organization.\nDuring his Chicago years in the late 1950s, DeBerry found it hard to keep a job. \"I would get a job and it would last only 3 days. I would go from one job to another. The &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; would visit my boss and I would be fired.\" DeBerry gave up on the city and moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in 1960.\nPolitical career.\nDeBerry's career as a political activist began in earnest in the 1950s. In 1955 he helped organize a mass protest in Chicago to protest the &lt;a href=\"lynching\"&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Emmett%20Till\"&gt;Emmett Till&lt;/a&gt; back home in his native Mississippi. DeBerry spoke out in defense of the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Revolution\"&gt;Cuban Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, in support of African liberation struggles, and demanded withdrawal of U.S. troops from &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeBerry marched for &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights\"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Selma%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Selma, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and was a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20X\"&gt;Malcolm X&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. He was a delegate to the founding conventions of the &lt;a href=\"Negro%20Labor%20Congress\"&gt;Negro Labor Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Negro%20American%20Labor%20Council\"&gt;Negro American Labor Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 1963, DeBerry ran for councilman in the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; borough of New York City. He received 3,514 votes in the race.\nDeBerry was the Socialist Workers Party's candidate in the &lt;a href=\"1964%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1964 election&lt;/a&gt;. He was the party's first &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; candidate as well as the first African American candidate for president of any existing party (he was preceded in 1960 by marginal candidate &lt;a href=\"Clennon%20King\"&gt;Clennon King&lt;/a&gt;). DeBerry's running mate was &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Shaw%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Ed Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, a printer from &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1965 city election, DeBerry was the SWP's candidate for &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Mayor of New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1970%20New%20York%20state%20election\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;, he ran for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Governor of New York&lt;/a&gt; and polled 5,766 votes.\nDeBerry ran again in the &lt;a href=\"1980%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1980 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt; as one of three candidates the party had that year, the others being &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Pulley\"&gt;Andrew Pulley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Congress\"&gt;Richard Congress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Matilde%20Zimmermann\"&gt;Matilde Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Vice%20President\"&gt;vice presidential&lt;/a&gt; candidate on all three tickets.\nDeath and legacy.\nClifton DeBerry died of heart failure on March 24, 2006 in a hospital near his home of &lt;a href=\"Union%20City%2C%20California\"&gt;Union City, California&lt;/a&gt;. He was 82 years old. A memorial meeting was held in his honor by the Socialist Workers Party in New York City on April 29, 2006.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Activists for African-American civil rights]]\n[[Category:African-American candidates for President of the United States]]\n[[Category:Candidates in the 1964 United States presidential election]]\n[[Category:Candidates in the 1980 United States presidential election]]\n[[Category:Members of the Communist Party USA]]\n[[Category:People from Holly Springs, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Socialist Workers Party (United States) politicians from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Socialist Workers Party (United States) presidential nominees]]\n[[Category:African-American people in Mississippi politics]]"
