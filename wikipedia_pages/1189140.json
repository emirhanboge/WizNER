    "text": "DDT (or \u0414\u0414\u0422 in &lt;a href=\"Cyrillic\"&gt;Cyrillic&lt;/a&gt;) is a popular &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"rock%20band\"&gt;rock band&lt;/a&gt; founded by its lead singer and the only remaining original member, &lt;a href=\"Yuri%20Shevchuk\"&gt;Yuri Shevchuk&lt;/a&gt; (\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0443\u043a), in &lt;a href=\"Ufa\"&gt;Ufa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bashkir%20ASSR\"&gt;Bashkir ASSR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RSFSR\"&gt;RSFSR&lt;/a&gt;) in 1980. The band was named after the pesticide &lt;a href=\"DDT\"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey are one of the better known and most prolific Russian bands of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\nHistory.\nUfa period (1980-1985).\nThe band was formed in 1980 in &lt;a href=\"Ufa\"&gt;Ufa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bashkir%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Bashkir ASSR&lt;/a&gt; and originally consisted of five members:\nIn 1982, the \"&lt;a href=\"Komsomolskaya%20Pravda\"&gt;Komsomolskaya Pravda&lt;/a&gt;\" paper sponsored a competition for young musicians called \"&lt;a href=\"Zolotoy%20Kamerton\"&gt;Zolotoy Kamerton&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Literal%20translation\"&gt;lit.&lt;/a&gt; 'Golden Tuning Fork'). DDT submitted three compositions - \"Inoplanetyane\" (Aliens), \"Chyornoye solntse\" (Black Sun), and \"Ne strelyai!\" (Don't Shoot!). During the long-running competition, the group published their first album (on tape), \"&lt;a href=\"Svinya%20na%20raduge\"&gt;Svinya na raduge&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Pig on a Rainbow\"). The album contained elements of &lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, popular music in the former Soviet Union was split between sanctioned \"official\" performers who were admitted to the musicians' union, and underground artists. Such underground artists were often highly trained musicians who also had other jobs. A complex underground network evolved in the 1980s and \"unofficial\" music became widely distributed (although the compensation for the artists was very limited), by \"&lt;a href=\"magnitizdat\"&gt;magnitizdat&lt;/a&gt;\", i.e., in a similar way to the underground channels that had existed for non-state sanctioned literature (&lt;a href=\"samizdat\"&gt;samizdat&lt;/a&gt;). Such \"underground\" artists became widely known, and their unofficial albums were sometimes mentioned in the press. In the 1980s, DDT straddled the line between underground and sanctioned artists, but was close to the underground in their musical, lyrical, and performing styles.\nDDT's submission to \"Zolotoy Kamerton\" reached the final round of the competition and the group was invited to perform in concert at &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Orlyonok%20complex\"&gt;Orlyonok complex&lt;/a&gt;, together with the other finalist, &lt;a href=\"Rok-sentyabr\"&gt;Rok-sentyabr&lt;/a&gt; (Rock-September) from &lt;a href=\"Cherepovets\"&gt;Cherepovets&lt;/a&gt;. DDT and three members of Rock-September, &lt;a href=\"Vyacheslav%20Kobrin\"&gt;Vyacheslav Kobrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yevgeny%20Belozyorov\"&gt;Yevgeny Belozyorov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Maslennikov\"&gt;Andrey Maslennikov&lt;/a&gt;, soon produced a collaborative album (on tape), \"Monolog v Saigone\" (\"Monologue in Saigon\"), later renamed to \"&lt;a href=\"Kompromiss%20%28DDT%20album%29\"&gt;Kompromiss&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Compromise\"). After recording the album, Sigachyov and Shevchuk returned to &lt;a href=\"Ufa\"&gt;Ufa&lt;/a&gt;.\nSigachyov distanced himself from the group, while Shevchuk recruited new members including Rodin, &lt;a href=\"drummer\"&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Rudoy\"&gt;Sergey Rudoy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guitarist\"&gt;guitarist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rustam%20Rezvanov\"&gt;Rustam Rezvanov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Vladislav%20Senchillo\"&gt;Vladislav Senchillo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 1983, DDT successfully performed at the &lt;a href=\"Luzhniki%20Stadium\"&gt;Luzhniki Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow, as part of a three-day, sanctioned festival, \"&lt;a href=\"Rok%20za%20mir\"&gt;Rok za mir&lt;/a&gt;\" (Rock for Peace). Their performance, however, was edited out of the official television program covering the event.\nThe new collective produced the album \"&lt;a href=\"Periferia\"&gt;Periferia&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Periphery\") in April 1984. After recording this album, some members of the group landed on a &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; watch list and were subjected to government persecution. The band's music was banned, forcing them to go underground. Ironically, this served to increase their popularity among young Russian music fans.\nAlthough they never considered themselves political activists, Shevchuk always felt it his duty as a citizen and a songwriter to address not only the strengths but the weaknesses of his country's government, a dangerous stance to take in the former Soviet Union. DDT continued to work as a \"non-conformist\" group, producing albums and giving concerts throughout the Soviet Union. This was no easy feat, as they received little if any money for the records they produced during this period, and very little for their concerts. Like other dissident artists, they survived through a combination of cleverness, perseverance, and unofficial help from their fan base.\nShevchuk spent some time in Sverdlovsk (present-day &lt;a href=\"Yekaterinburg\"&gt;Yekaterinburg&lt;/a&gt;), performing with the group &lt;a href=\"Urfin%20Juis\"&gt;Urfin Juis&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1985, DDT covertly recorded the album \"&lt;a href=\"Vremya%20%28album%29\"&gt;Vremya&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Time\") in Moscow with additional musicians; recording process was very difficult.\n1986-1997.\nIn 1986, Shevchuk moved to Leningrad (now &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;) with his wife, son and mother. The move helped him to establish himself at the forefront of the Russian rock scene as St. Petersburg was a center of musical resurgence. In 1987, he rebuilt DDT. Its new members included:\nOn January 23, 1987, the new lineup debuted on the stage of the &lt;a href=\"Leningrad%20Rock%20Club\"&gt;Leningrad Rock Club&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1987, DDT performed at a \"Leningrad rock festival\" in front of an overflowing crowd of 3,000 crammed into a venue with a capacity of 1,000.\nIn the summer of 1988, DDT toured across Russia and recorded a new album, \"\" (\"I was given this role\"), which contained some songs from the old albums re-recorded in a professional studio. In 1988, the band also made their first visit to the U.S.; their concert in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; was covered by MTV.\nIn 1989, they went on another tour with the band &lt;a href=\"Alisa%20%28Russian%20band%29\"&gt;Alisa&lt;/a&gt;, performing at a rock festival in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. In 1990, DDT performed several concerts in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Also in 1990 DDT released \"&lt;a href=\"Ottepel%20%28album%29\"&gt;Ottepel&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Thaw\"), which presented the band's first concert program from the St. Petersburg period. They also participate in the &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Tsoi\"&gt;Viktor Tsoi&lt;/a&gt; tribute concert, after the renowned singer-songwriter died in a car accident on August 15, 1990.\nAfter the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, DDT attracted an even greater following both at home and abroad, as their albums and concerts began to be broadcast and publicized more widely. In 1991, DDT recorded another album, the bleak and keyboards-heavy \"\" (\"A crawling soldier\", originally the name of Cossack infantrymen), but after many months of work Shevchuk decided to shelve it and the album was not released until 1995, four years later.\nIn 1992 DDT released the album ' (\"Spring the Actress\"). This lyrical album, which was dedicated to Shevchuk's deceased wife, Elmira, met with great popular success. It contained some of the band's greatest hits, include \"Shto takoe osen'\" (What is autumn), \"Dozhd'\" (Rain), and \"Rodina\" (Motherland). After releasing the album, the band toured extensively. Soon afterwards the group began to change their sound and performance strategy by adding \"programmes\" - conceptually prepared concerts - to its repertoire. During December 1992 and January 1993, DDT presented its first program, ' (Black Mongrel Petersburg), and toured widely in &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;CIS&lt;/a&gt; countries. On May 27, 1993, on the anniversary of the founding of St. Petersburg, DDT performed a free concert in &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Square\"&gt;Dvortsovaya Square&lt;/a&gt;. 120,000 people attended.\nIn the beginning of 1994, a new album, ' (\"That's all\u2026\"), was recorded. Musicians planned to make a double album, however because of challenging deadlines and the instability of the lineup, a significant amount of early musical material and recordings did not make it into the final version. Years later, these songs would be included in the band's ' (\"Born in the USSR\") album.\nDuring the summer of 1994, DDT took part in the rock festival &lt;a href=\"White%20Nights%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;White Nights of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. That autumn, the group was awarded the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Ovatsiya%20award\"&gt;Ovatsiya award&lt;/a&gt; (Ovation) for Best Rock Group of the Year. Yuri Shevchuk was also named Best Rock Musician of the Year.\nIn January 1995, during &lt;a href=\"First%20Chechen%20War\"&gt;First Chechen War&lt;/a&gt;, Shevchuk went on a peace mission to &lt;a href=\"Chechnya\"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, where he performed 50 concerts for both Russian troops and Chechen citizens alike. On June 25, 1995, DDT performed a 15th anniversary concert in &lt;a href=\"Petrovsky%20stadium\"&gt;Petrovsky stadium&lt;/a&gt;, attracting an audience of tens of thousands of fans. Afterwards, the group toured with its newest programme, \"&lt;a href=\"Ot%20i%20do\"&gt;Ot i do&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"From and to\"). At the end of the winter of 1995\u20131996, the group spent time working in the United States.\nIn February\u2013March 1996, DDT recorded a new album, \"&lt;a href=\"Lyubov%20%28album%29\"&gt;Lyubov&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Love\"), at &lt;a href=\"Long%20View%20Farm\"&gt;Long View Farm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; with two new musicians: bassist I. Tikhomirov (from the group &lt;a href=\"Kino%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kino&lt;/a&gt;) and keyboard player D. Galitsky.\nIn the summer of 1996, upon their return from the United States, the group headlined several festivals, including &lt;a href=\"VladiROCKstok\"&gt;VladiROCKstok&lt;/a&gt;, the first large-scale international music festival in the formerly closed city of &lt;a href=\"Vladivostok\"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt; on the Sea of Japan.\n1998-2004.\nIn May 1998, the band released a new album titled ' (\"World number zero\") - a concept album which contained influences from &lt;a href=\"industrial%20music\"&gt;industrial music&lt;/a&gt; and relied heavily on electronic and computer-generated music. With this program DDT had lost a part of their old fans but found a huge success among the young auditory - a fact which DDT were very pleased by. \"Mir nomer nol'\" tour included about 70 cities in Russia and overseas. A new album, ' (\"Snowstorm of August\"), contained mostly outtakes from \"Mir nomer nol\" as well as songs with more warm and lyrical atmosphere.\nSince then, the band has won a number of Russian music awards and been awarded humanitarian citations for their creative and charitable work. Shevchuk and his group also regularly travel throughout the C.I.S. and other former Soviet republics to give benefit concerts: in the spring and summer of 2002, 10 out of 11 concerts that the band played were benefits for various social and cultural organizations. The band has transcended Russia, reaching an ever-growing audience in the U.S. and Europe, and for the past 20 years have traveled frequently throughout the world, playing concerts and gaining new fans with their unique sound. Shevchuk's music and lyrics are not only influenced by traditional \"western\" rock music, but also by the entire scope of Russian folk, classical, and religious music. In many respects, Shevchuk's initial years of struggle as an underground musicians shaped his and, by extension, the band's philosophy toward their art. The question of the music's marketability was never part of the song writing process as there was no \"market\" in which to compete but only an allegiance to the purity of artistic expression.\nIn 2002 and 2003 DDT released a double album called \"Yedinochestvo\" (\"Loneliness/Singleness\"). That duologue had even more experimental sound then \"Mir nomer nol\". After the following tour Vadim Kurilev, band's guitarist and bass-guitarist from original Piter line-up, had left a group to begin his solo career. One of Kurilev's last performances as DDT member was released on CD and DVD called \"&lt;a href=\"Gorod%20bez%20okon\"&gt;Gorod bez okon&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"A city without windows\").\n2005-present.\nIn 2005, DDT celebrated their 25th anniversary with an extended tour throughout Russia, Europe, and North America, and the release of a new album entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Propavshy%20bez%20vesti\"&gt;Propavshiy bez vesti&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Vanished without a trace\"), which received a critical acclaim.\nIn 2007 DDT released the album \"&lt;a href=\"Prekrasnaya%20lyobov%20%28album%29\"&gt;Prekrasnaya lyubov&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Beautiful love\"), a collection of previously unreleased songs which had been performed by the group for many years in addition to several new songs. The album differs from the previous albums, showcasing a greater focus on political and social subjects, rather than the more common musical abstraction of their last albums. Many songs are in the &lt;a href=\"chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt; style.\nOn March 3, 2008, DDT performed at the &lt;a href=\"Dissenters%27%20March\"&gt;Dissenters' March&lt;/a&gt; in St. Petersburg to protest the controversial election of &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Medvedev\"&gt;Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt; as President of Russia. Subsequently, in May 2010 Shevchuk received considerable media attention following a pointed dialogue with Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; in which he openly confronted him (on state television) with questions regarding such controversial topics as democracy, freedom of speech, assembly, and freedom of the press in Russia.\nOn September 24 and 26, 2008, DDT presented an anti-war program called \"Ne strelyay!\" (\"Don't Shoot!\"). These concerts (featuring musical bands from &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Ossetia\"&gt;South Ossetia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;) were dedicated to victims of wars, particularly the victims of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20South%20Ossetia%20war\"&gt;war in South Ossetia&lt;/a&gt;. The concert in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; was shown on TV by &lt;a href=\"Petersburg%20%E2%80%93%20Channel%205\"&gt;Channel 5&lt;/a&gt; without commercial breaks.\nIn the summer of 2009, DDT participated in the \"Rok nad Volgoy\" festival (\"Rock above the Volga\") in Samara and in the international music festival \"Sotvorenie mira\" (\"World creation\") in &lt;a href=\"Kazan\"&gt;Kazan&lt;/a&gt;. On September 2, 2009, the band performed on &lt;a href=\"All-Russia%20Exhibition%20Centre\"&gt;VVC Square&lt;/a&gt; to protest the demolition of historical buildings in Moscow.\nBy the time DDT started recording a next studio album, Shevchuk had become the only member from original Piter line-up and had brought together a brand new team:\nIn 2011, DDT released the concept album \"\" (\"Otherwise\"). According to Shevchuk, the album's central theme is a &lt;a href=\"freedom\"&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt; in all their forms and the lyrical hero is a &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hamlet\"&gt;Prince Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; of the 21st century which has no doubt about the question \"&lt;a href=\"To%20be%2C%20or%20not%20to%20be\"&gt;To be, or not to be&lt;/a&gt;?\", he clearly knows: \"To be!\", but the question - \"In which way?\"\nThe band embarked on a big and successful tour which lasted from 2011 to 2014. On April 5, 2012, DDT released a film titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sky%20Under%20the%20Heart\"&gt;Nebo pod serdtsem&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Sky Under the Heart\") a compilation of behind-the-scenes and concert footage from the band's performance at the \"&lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Moscow%29\"&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;\". That was the first &lt;a href=\"Multiple-camera%20setup\"&gt;multiple-camera&lt;/a&gt; concert films made in Russia. Later that year, the band took part in the rock festival \"The Best City UA\" in &lt;a href=\"Dnepropetrovsk\"&gt;Dnepropetrovsk&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, the band toured in Germany, performing at &lt;a href=\"Tempodrom\"&gt;Tempodrom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Grugahalle\"&gt;Grugahalle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Essen\"&gt;Essen&lt;/a&gt;. A was later released on CD+DVD in 2014.\nDDT always was and still is one of the most popular rock groups in Russia, and their concerts typically attract tens of thousands of fans. Shevchuk put together the first incarnation of the band in the summer of 1980, and although its members have changed over the years, he continues to voice the concerns and frustrations of the Russian people in his music today just as he did in the band's infancy. The more than 20 albums in DDT's discography not only chronicle the history of a rock group, but also provide poignant narratives that examine many aspects of life in the Soviet Union and Russia during the past 35 years."
