    "text": "William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Council%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;PC (Ire)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;FRS&lt;/a&gt; (3 April 174528 May 1814) was a British diplomat and politician who sat in the &lt;a href=\"British%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; from 1774 to 1793.\nEarly life.\nA member of the influential Eden family, Auckland was a younger son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of &lt;a href=\"Windlestone%20Hall\"&gt;Windlestone Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt;, and Mary, daughter of William Davison. His brothers included &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Eden%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir John Eden, 4th Baronet&lt;/a&gt;, also an MP; &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Robert%20Eden%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Maryland\"&gt;Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, the last royal &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Maryland\"&gt;Governor of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Morton%20Eden%2C%201st%20Baron%20Henley\"&gt;Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley&lt;/a&gt;, diplomat.\nHe was educated at &lt;a href=\"Durham%20School\"&gt;Durham School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Christ Church, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, and was called to the bar, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Temple\"&gt;Middle Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in 1768.\nCareer.\nIn 1771 Auckland published \"Principles of Penal Law\", and soon became a recognized authority on commercial and economic questions. In 1772 he took up an appointment as Under-Secretary of State for the North, a post he held until 1778. He was &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Woodstock%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; from 1774 to 1784 and served as a &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Trade\"&gt;Lord of Trade&lt;/a&gt; from 1776 to 1782. In 1778 he carried an Act for the improvement of the treatment of prisoners, and accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Howard%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle\"&gt;Earl of Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; as a commissioner to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; on an unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%20Peace%20Commission\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; to bring an end to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. During the War, he was head of the British spies in Europe, his budget reaching \u00a3200,000 by 1778. He probably oversaw a small group of intelligence collectors for Lord Suffolk. On his return in 1779 he published his widely-read \"Four Letters to the Earl of Carlisle\". In 1780 Auckland became &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Ireland\"&gt;Chief Secretary for Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, which he remained until 1782, and was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Council%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1780. He represented &lt;a href=\"Dungannon%20%28Parliament%20of%20Ireland%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dungannon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;Irish House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; between 1781 and 1783 and was Joint &lt;a href=\"Vice-Treasurer%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Vice-Treasurer of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; between 1783 and 1784. While in Ireland he established the National Bank.\nBetween 1784 and 1793 Auckland was Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Heytesbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Heytesbury&lt;/a&gt;. He was sworn of the &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council\"&gt;British Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1784 and served as Envoy to France from 1785 to 1787 (on a mission dealing with commerce); he was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Spain\"&gt;Ambassador to Spain&lt;/a&gt; between 1787 and 1789 and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Ambassador to the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; between 1789 and 1793. In 1789 he was raised to the &lt;a href=\"Peerage%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Peerage of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; as Baron Auckland and in 1793 he retired from public service, receiving a pension of \u00a32300, and was further honoured when he was made Baron Auckland, of &lt;a href=\"West%20Auckland\"&gt;West Auckland&lt;/a&gt; in the County of Durham, in the Peerage of Great Britain.\nDuring his retirement in the country at &lt;a href=\"Beckenham\"&gt;Beckenham&lt;/a&gt;, he continued his friendship with &lt;a href=\"William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger\"&gt;William Pitt the Younger&lt;/a&gt;, his nearest neighbour at &lt;a href=\"Holwood%20House\"&gt;Holwood House&lt;/a&gt;, who at one time had thoughts of marrying his daughter (see below). With Pitt's sanction he published his \"Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War\" in 1795, to prepare public opinion for a peace.\nHe was later included in Pitt's government as Joint &lt;a href=\"Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Postmaster General&lt;/a&gt; in 1798. He severely criticized Pitt's resignation in 1801, from which he had endeavoured to dissuade him, and retained office under &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Addington%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Sidmouth\"&gt;Henry Addington&lt;/a&gt;. This terminated his friendship with Pitt, who excluded him from his administration in 1804 though he increased his pension. Auckland later served under &lt;a href=\"William%20Grenville%2C%201st%20Baron%20Grenville\"&gt;Lord Grenville&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade\"&gt;President of the Board of Trade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20All%20the%20Talents\"&gt;Ministry of All the Talents&lt;/a&gt; between 1806 and 1807.\nHis \"Journal and Correspondence\", published in 1861\u20131862, throws much light on the political history of the time. The &lt;a href=\"subantarctic\"&gt;subantarctic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Islands\"&gt;Auckland Islands&lt;/a&gt; group to the south of &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, discovered in 1806, were named after him, as was &lt;a href=\"Eden%20Quay\"&gt;Eden Quay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1776, Lord Auckland married Eleanor Elliot, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Gilbert%20Elliot%2C%203rd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Minto\"&gt;Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet&lt;/a&gt; and Agnes Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound (daughter and heiress of Hugh Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound). Eleanor was a sister of &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Eliott%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Minto\"&gt;Gilbert Eliott, 1st Earl of Minto&lt;/a&gt;. They had six sons and eight daughters, including:\nLord Auckland died in May 1814 and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, &lt;a href=\"George%20Eden%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Auckland\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt;, who was created &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Auckland\"&gt;Earl of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; in 1839. Lady Auckland died in May 1818."
