    "text": "Reuben Morris Greenberg (June 24, 1943 \u2013 September 24, 2014) was the first &lt;a href=\"Black%20%28people%29\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20police\"&gt;police chief&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and known for being an innovative &lt;a href=\"criminologist\"&gt;criminologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was police chief there from 1982 until his retirement in 2005.\nChildhood.\nBorn on June 24, 1943 in Houston, Texas, Greenberg was the son of a Russian Jewish &lt;a href=\"immigrant\"&gt;immigrant&lt;/a&gt; father and an &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; mother. Of &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jewish&lt;/a&gt; ancestry on his father's side, he converted to his father's religion of &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 26.\nEducation.\nGreenberg received his &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; in anthropology from &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20State%20University\"&gt;San Francisco State University&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, and earned &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"public%20administration\"&gt;public administration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Urban%20planning\"&gt;city planning&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; in 1969 and 1975. He was also a graduate of the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Academy\"&gt;FBI Academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeaching career.\nHe taught &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant professor at &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University\"&gt;California State University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"political%20science\"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"criminal%20justice\"&gt;criminal justice&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20International%20University\"&gt;Florida International University&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaw enforcement career.\nHe served as the Undersheriff of the Chatham County Sheriff's Department in &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, and he was a major with the city's police department. In Florida, he was Chief of Police at &lt;a href=\"Opa-locka\"&gt;Opa-locka&lt;/a&gt; and Chief Deputy Sheriff of Orange County, rising to Deputy Director of the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Department%20of%20Law%20Enforcement\"&gt;Florida Department of Law Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived in Charleston as Chief of Police in 1982.\nIn the words of Charleston's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Post%20and%20Courier\"&gt;The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;\" reporter David Slade, he \"turned the... Police Department into a national model. In the process, he became a celebrity and a source of pride for the city ...\"\nGreenberg told his cops that their job was not to punish (that was up to the courts), but to make arrests, and in order to do that they had to be on good terms with the citizens. So he put his cops out on the streets, not in cars. They walked, rode bicycles and horses, and were accessible to \"normal people,\" who might not want to call or visit headquarters.\nHe also required that every cop earn a bachelor's degree, whereas when he arrived at the department not all had even graduated from high school. He added a &lt;a href=\"Police%20dog\"&gt;K-9&lt;/a&gt; bomb and drug-sniffing unit, a harbor patrol, and a crime lab to the police department. He had a team of officers remove graffiti the moment it appeared, sending a message that the city belonged to the police, not the vandals.\nIt worked, and Greenberg became a media celebrity. The Los Angeles Times headlined its profile, \"Black Police Chief Skates Past Skeptics.\"\nCharleston's population increased 64% during the time Greenberg was chief, while crime decreased 11 percent.\nGreenberg retired in 2005 after over 23 years of service. This followed a controversial 2005 incident in which a motorist charged that he hit her car door after she told him that she had called the police department to report his erratic driving. Health reasons, such as high blood pressure, were cited as the cause for his behavior for several years, which included poking a news reporter in the chest while on video in 2003 (he later apologized, saying \"I'm not proud ... It was not my finest hour\"), calling an anti-war demonstrator a \"crazy fat lady\" in 2003 (he later said, \"I was wrong. She's not fat. She's obese. She's grossly obese. If she doesn't like that, she can do something about it, like the &lt;a href=\"Atkins%20diet\"&gt;Atkins diet&lt;/a&gt; that I was on.\"), and being involved in five traffic accidents while in his police vehicle over a 6-year period. During one of these accidents, in 2005, he hit a car while turning the wrong way down a one-way street.\nDeath.\nGreenberg died on September 24, 2014, in Charleston, South Carolina after a long illness.\nAwards.\nGreenberg was named \"Justice Professional of the Year\" in 1991 by the Southern Criminal Justice Foundation, received the Foundation for Improvement of Justice 1989 Achievement Award and the \"Free Spirit Award\" from the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Forum\"&gt;Freedom Forum&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 for distinguished success in fighting crime.\nAuthor.\nGreenberg was the author of \"Let's Take Back Our Streets,\" 1989, written with Arthur Gordon, a consulting editor of &lt;a href=\"Guideposts\"&gt;Guideposts&lt;/a&gt;. In the book he told about moves he made to take back the streets in his adopted city from criminals, and what he thought other law officers could do to accomplish that.\nHe also authored a number of police-related articles, and has appeared as a guest columnist for several newspapers, most notably the \"&lt;a href=\"Detroit%20News\"&gt;Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;\" He was the subject of an article in \"&lt;a href=\"Readers%20Digest\"&gt;Readers Digest&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTV.\nGreenberg explained his tactics and strategies on television programs such as &lt;a href=\"60%20Minutes\"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20King%20Live\"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Phil%20Donahue%20Show\"&gt;The Phil Donahue Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Today%20%28NBC%20program%29\"&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Both%20Sides\"&gt;Both Sides&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Jackson\"&gt;Jesse Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20MacNeil/Lehrer%20Newshour\"&gt;The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm.\nGreenberg appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Shalom%20Y%27all\"&gt;Shalom Y'all&lt;/a&gt;\", a 2002 documentary about Jews in the American South which also featured author and singer &lt;a href=\"Kinky%20Friedman\"&gt;Kinky Friedman&lt;/a&gt;."
