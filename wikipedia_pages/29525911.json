    "text": "Rhoicissus tomentosa (or the Cape grape) is a vigorous, evergreen vine that is indigenous to the &lt;a href=\"Afromontane\"&gt;afro-montane forests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"southern%20Africa\"&gt;southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is increasingly popular as an ornamental creeper in gardens, and it has a wide range of uses in traditional medicine.\nAppearance.\nA lush, dense, attractive creeper that naturally reaches up to the &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; canopy and covers the tree-tops with its foliage. New velvety shoots grow upwards, reaching out with their &lt;a href=\"tendril\"&gt;tendril&lt;/a&gt;s, while old stems or &lt;a href=\"liana\"&gt;liana&lt;/a&gt;s hang like rope from the canopy.\nThe large, simple, roughly circular leaves are deep green above and soft and velvety below. In fact, they resemble the 3-lobed leaves of their Eurasian relative, the Grapevine (\"&lt;a href=\"Vitis%20vinifera\"&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/a&gt;\"), with slightly serrated, wavy margins. The leaves start off as maroon or copper-coloured with thick velvety fur (\"tomentosa\" = \"velvety\"), they turn a dark rich green as they mature, and finally before they fall they become crimson.&lt;br&gt;\nThe creeper produces clumps of furry flower-buds that open into small &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s in summer. These are followed by bunches of dark purple, edible, &lt;a href=\"grape\"&gt;grape&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"berries\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. The berries make a good jam.\nDistribution.\nThe Cape grape can be found throughout the wetter regions of southern Africa, from the forests on the eastern slopes of &lt;a href=\"Table%20Mountain\"&gt;Table Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, eastwards throughout the coastal afro-temperate forests of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cape%20Provinces\"&gt;Cape Provinces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KwaZulu-Natal\"&gt;KwaZulu-Natal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Provinces\"&gt;Northern Provinces&lt;/a&gt;) and then on to &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrowing \"Rhoicissus tomentosa\".\nA very attractive and easy-to-grow creeper for gardening. Its even, multi-coloured, evergreen foliage is particularly attractive and ornamental, and it makes a good local alternative to &lt;a href=\"ivy\"&gt;ivy&lt;/a&gt; for African gardens. It can also be grown in the shade (and even indoors) as well as in the open sun.\nIt can be used as a groundcover in shady areas; it can be planted to grow up walls like ivy (although it requires a trellis of some sort for its tendrils to hold onto); it readily climbs up and over a fence to form a screen or hedge; and it can even be used to make wire-basket topiaries.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Cape Grape can easily be grown from seed, although cuttings can also be rooted."
