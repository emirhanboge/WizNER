    "text": "The R-7 Expressway is a proposed expressway in &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; that will be partially elevated and partially underground expressway. Originally proposed in 1993, the project will be constructed over the most heavily congested corridors in Metro Manila, namely &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20Avenue\"&gt;Quezon Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Quezon%20City\"&gt;Commonwealth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. The expressway will be connecting &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; and the City of &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; with high speed transport facility, thus decongest traffic of at-grade road.
