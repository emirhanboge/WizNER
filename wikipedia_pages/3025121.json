The five-song single, released by Thought Squad, continues the band's turn to more politically themed lyrics first heard on their 2003 release, \"&lt;a href=\"Close%20My%20Eyes%20%28album%29\"&gt;Close My Eyes&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe EP features a full-band version of the song \"International War Criminal\" which first appeared on &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Ruggiero\"&gt;Vic Ruggiero&lt;/a&gt;'s second solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Alive%20at%20the%20Ladybug%20House\"&gt;Alive at the Ladybug House&lt;/a&gt;\". A dub version of \"Propaganda\" also appears on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Slackers/Pulley%20Split\"&gt;The Slackers/Pulley Split&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Afternoon%20in%20Dub\"&gt;An Afternoon in Dub&lt;/a&gt;\".
