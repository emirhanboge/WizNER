Souths raced out to an 11-0 lead at halftime before University scored a converted try to make the score 11-5. After University scored this try they were unable to score any further points as the Souths defence held firm and they lost the final at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Showground%20%28Moore%20Park%29\"&gt;Royal Agricultural Society Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in front of 20,000 spectators.\nIn 1927, University finished last on the table and claimed the wooden spoon.
