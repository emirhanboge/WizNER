    "text": "Babi Yar (, Babyn Yar or Babin Yar; , Babiy Yar) is a &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; and a site of massacres carried out by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s forces during &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;its campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The first and best documented of the massacres took place on 29\u201330 September 1941, killing approximately 33,771 &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;. The decision to kill all the Jews in Kyiv was made by the military governor &lt;a href=\"Generalmajor\"&gt;Generalmajor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Eberhard\"&gt;Kurt Eberhard&lt;/a&gt;, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Obergruppenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Jeckeln\"&gt;Friedrich Jeckeln&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Einsatzgruppe\" C Commander &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Rasch\"&gt;Otto Rasch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sonderkommandos%20of%20Einsatzgruppen\"&gt;Sonderkommando&lt;/a&gt; 4a as the sub-unit of \"Einsatzgruppe\" C, along with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Sicherheitsdienst\"&gt;SD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Order%20Police%20battalions\"&gt;Order Police battalions&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Auxiliary%20Police\"&gt;Ukrainian Auxiliary Police&lt;/a&gt; backed by the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;, carried out the orders. Sonderkommando 4a and the 45th Battalion of the German Order Police conducted the shootings. Servicemen of the 303rd Battalion of the German Order Police at this time guarded the outer perimeter of the execution site.\nThe massacre was the largest mass killing under the auspices of the Nazi regime and its collaborators during its campaign against the Soviet Union, and it has been called \"the largest single massacre in the history of &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;\" to that particular date. It is only surpassed overall by the later &lt;a href=\"1941%20Odessa%20massacre\"&gt;1941 Odessa massacre&lt;/a&gt; of more than 50,000 Jews in October 1941 (committed by &lt;a href=\"Romania%20in%20World%20War%20II%23Romania%20and%20the%20Holocaust\"&gt;German and Romanian troops&lt;/a&gt;), and by \"&lt;a href=\"Aktion%20Erntefest\"&gt;Aktion Erntefest&lt;/a&gt;\" of November 1943 in &lt;a href=\"occupied%20Poland\"&gt;occupied Poland&lt;/a&gt; with 42,000\u201343,000 victims.\nVictims of other massacres at the site included Soviet &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt;, communists, &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20nationalists\"&gt;Ukrainian nationalists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 150,000 people were killed at Babi Yar during the German occupation.\nHistorical background.\nThe Babi Yar (Babyn Yar) ravine was first mentioned in historical accounts in 1401, in connection with its sale by \"baba\" (an old woman) who was also the \"cantiniere\", to the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; Monastery. The word \"yar\" is &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20language\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; in origin and means \"gully\" or \"ravine\". In the course of several centuries the site had been used for various purposes including military camps and at least two cemeteries, among them an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christian&lt;/a&gt; cemetery and a Jewish cemetery. The latter was officially closed in 1937.\nMassacres of 29\u201330 September 1941.\nAxis forces, mainly German, occupied Kyiv on 19 September 1941. Between 20 and 28 September, explosives planted by the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;Soviet secret police&lt;/a&gt; caused extensive damage in the city; and on 24 September an explosion rocked Rear Headquarters Army Group South. Two days later, on 26 September, Maj. Gen. &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Eberhard\"&gt;Kurt Eberhard&lt;/a&gt;, the military governor, and SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Obergruppenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Jeckeln\"&gt;Friedrich Jeckeln&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"SS%20and%20Police%20Leader\"&gt;SS and Police Leader&lt;/a&gt;, met at Rear Headquarters Army Group South. There, they made the decision to exterminate the Jews of Kyiv, claiming that it was in retaliation for the explosions. Also present were SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Standartenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Standartenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Blobel\"&gt;Paul Blobel&lt;/a&gt;, commander of \"Sonderkommando 4a\" of Einsatzgruppe C, and his superior, SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Brigadef%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Brigadef\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" Dr. &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Rasch\"&gt;Otto Rasch&lt;/a&gt;, commander of \"&lt;a href=\"Einsatzgruppen\"&gt;Einsatzgruppe C&lt;/a&gt;\". The mass-killing was to be carried out by units under the command of Rasch and Blobel, who were ultimately responsible for a number of atrocities in Soviet Ukraine during the summer and autumn of 1941.\nThe implementation of the order was entrusted to \"Sonderkommando 4a\" of Einsatzgruppe C commanded by Blobel, under the general command of Friedrich Jeckeln. This unit consisted of \"&lt;a href=\"Sicherheitsdienst\"&gt;Sicherheitsdienst&lt;/a&gt;\" (SD) and \"&lt;a href=\"Sicherheitspolizei\"&gt;Sicherheitspolizei&lt;/a&gt;\" (SiPo), the third company of the Special Duties &lt;a href=\"Waffen-SS\"&gt;Waffen-SS&lt;/a&gt; battalion, and a platoon of the 9th Police Battalion. \"Sonderkommando 4a\" of Einsatzgruppe C\nand Police Battalion 45, commanded by Major Besser, conducted the massacre, supported by members of a Waffen-SS battalion. Contrary to the myth of the \"&lt;a href=\"clean%20Wehrmacht\"&gt;clean Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;Sixth Army&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Field Marshal &lt;a href=\"Walter%20von%20Reichenau\"&gt;Walter von Reichenau&lt;/a&gt; worked together with the SS and SD to plan and execute the mass-murder of the Jews of Kyiv.\nOn 26 September 1941 the following order was posted:\nOn 29 and 30 September 1941, the Nazis and their collaborators murdered approximately 33,771 &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; civilians at Babi Yar. The order to kill the Jews of Kyiv was given to \"Sonderkommando\" 4a of \"Einsatzgruppe\" C, consisting of SD and SiPo men, the third company of the Special Duties Waffen-SS battalion, and a platoon of the No. 9 police battalion. These units were reinforced by police battalions Nos. 45 and 303, by units of the Ukrainian auxiliary police, and supported by local collaborators. Sonderkommando 4a and the 45th Battalion of the German Order Police conducted the shootings. Servicemen of the 303rd Battalion of the German Order Police at this time guarded the outer perimeter of the execution site.\nThe commander of the \"&lt;a href=\"Einsatzkommando\"&gt;Einsatzkommando&lt;/a&gt;\" reported two days later:\nAccording to the testimony of a truck driver named Hofer, victims were ordered to undress and were beaten if they resisted:\nThe crowd was large enough that most of the victims could not have known what was happening until it was too late; by the time they heard the &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt; fire, there was no chance to escape. All were driven down a corridor of soldiers, in groups of ten, and then shot. A truck driver described the scene.\nIn the evening, the Germans undermined the wall of the ravine and buried the people under the thick layers of earth. According to the Einsatzgruppe's Operational Situation Report, 33,771 Jews from Kyiv and its suburbs were systematically shot dead by machine-gun fire at Babi Yar on 29 and 30 September 1941. The money, valuables, underwear, and clothing of the murdered were turned over to the local &lt;a href=\"Volksdeutsche\"&gt;ethnic Germans&lt;/a&gt; and to the Nazi administration of the city. Wounded victims were buried alive in the ravine along with the rest of the bodies.\nFurther massacres.\nIn the months that followed, thousands more were seized and taken to Babi Yar where they were shot. It is estimated that more than 100,000 residents of Kyiv of all ethnic groups, mostly civilians, were murdered by the Nazis there during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. A concentration camp was also built in the area.\nMass executions at Babi Yar continued until the Nazis evacuated the city of Kyiv. On 10 January 1942 about 100 captured Soviet sailors were executed there after being forced to disinter and cremate the bodies of previous victims. In addition, Babi Yar became a place of execution of residents of five Gypsy camps. Patients of the Ivan Pavlov &lt;a href=\"Psychiatric%20Hospital\"&gt;Psychiatric Hospital&lt;/a&gt; were gassed and then dumped into the ravine. Thousands of other Ukrainians were killed at Babi Yar. Among those murdered were 621 members of the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20Ukrainian%20Nationalists\"&gt;Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists&lt;/a&gt; (OUN). Ukrainian poet and activist &lt;a href=\"Olena%20Teliha\"&gt;Olena Teliha&lt;/a&gt; and her husband, and renowned &lt;a href=\"bandurist\"&gt;bandurist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mykhailo%20Teliha\"&gt;Mykhailo Teliha&lt;/a&gt;, were murdered there on 21 February 1942. Also killed in 1941 was Ukrainian activist writer &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Rohach\"&gt;Ivan Rohach&lt;/a&gt;, his sister, and his staff.\nUpon the Soviet liberation of Kyiv in 1943, Soviet officials led Western journalists to the site of the massacres and allowed them to interview survivors. Among the journalists were &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Lawrence%20%28news%20personality%29\"&gt;Bill Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Downs\"&gt;Bill Downs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"CBS%20News\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;. Downs described in a report to \"&lt;a href=\"Newsweek\"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;\" what he had been told by one of the survivors, Efim Vilkis:\nNumbers murdered.\nEstimates of the total number killed at Babi Yar during the Nazi occupation vary. In 1946, Soviet prosecutor L. N. Smirnov at the &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg%20trials\"&gt;Nuremberg trials&lt;/a&gt; claimed there were approximately 100,000 corpses lying in Babi Yar, using materials of the &lt;a href=\"Extraordinary%20State%20Commission\"&gt;Extraordinary State Commission&lt;/a&gt; set out by the Soviets to investigate Nazi crimes after the liberation of Kyiv in 1943. According to testimonies of workers forced to burn the bodies, the numbers range from 70,000 to 120,000.\nIn a recently published letter to Israeli journalist, writer and translator Shlomo Even-Shoshan dated 17 May 1965, &lt;a href=\"Anatoly%20Kuznetsov\"&gt;Anatoly Kuznetsov&lt;/a&gt; commented on the Babi Yar :\nSurvivors.\nOne of the most often-cited parts of &lt;a href=\"Anatoly%20Kuznetsov\"&gt;Anatoly Kuznetsov&lt;/a&gt;'s documentary novel is the testimony of &lt;a href=\"Dina%20Pronicheva\"&gt;Dina Pronicheva&lt;/a&gt;, an actress of the Kyiv Puppet Theatre, and a survivor. She was one of those ordered to march to the ravine, to be forced to undress and then be shot. Jumping before being shot and falling on other bodies, she played dead in a pile of corpses. She held perfectly still while the Nazis continued to shoot the wounded or gasping victims. Although the SS had covered the mass grave with earth, she eventually managed to climb through the soil and escape. Since it was dark, she had to avoid the torches of the Nazis finishing off the remaining victims still alive, wounded and gasping in the grave. She was one of the very few survivors of the massacre and later related her story to Kuznetsov. At least 29 survivors are known.\nIn 2006, &lt;a href=\"Yad%20Vashem\"&gt;Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt; and other Jewish organisations started a project to identify and name the Babi Yar victims, but so far only 10% have been identified. Yad Vashem has recorded the names of around 3,000 Jews killed at Babi Yar, as well as those of some 7,000 Jews from &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; who were killed during &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;.\nSyrets concentration camp.\nIn the course of the German occupation, the &lt;a href=\"Syrets%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Syrets concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; was set up in Babi Yar. Interned &lt;a href=\"communists\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;, Soviet &lt;a href=\"prisoners%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt; (POWs), and captured resistance members were murdered there, among others. On 18 February 1943, three &lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20Kyiv\"&gt;Dynamo Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; football players (Trusevich, Klimenko, and Putistin) who took part in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20Match\"&gt;Match of Death&lt;/a&gt; with the German &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; team were also murdered in the camp.\nConcealment of the crimes.\nBefore the Nazis retreated from Kyiv ahead of the Soviet offensive of 1944, they were ordered by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Koppe\"&gt;Wilhelm Koppe&lt;/a&gt; to conceal their atrocities in the East. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Blobel\"&gt;Paul Blobel&lt;/a&gt;, who had been in control of the mass murders in Babi Yar two years earlier, supervised the &lt;a href=\"Sonderaktion%201005\"&gt;Sonderaktion 1005&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating its traces. The \"Aktion\" was carried out earlier in all &lt;a href=\"extermination%20camp\"&gt;extermination camp&lt;/a&gt;s. The bodies were exhumed, burned and the ashes scattered over farmland in the vicinity. Several hundred prisoners of war from the Syrets concentration camp were forced to build funeral pyres out of Jewish gravestones and exhume the bodies for cremation.\nTrials.\nIn the aftermath of the war, several SS commanders who had planned and supervised the massacre were arrested and put on trial. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Blobel\"&gt;Paul Blobel&lt;/a&gt;, the overall commander of the SS unit responsible for the massacre, was sentenced to death by the &lt;a href=\"Subsequent%20Nuremberg%20Trials\"&gt;Subsequent Nuremberg Trials&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Einsatzgruppen%20Trial\"&gt;Einsatzgruppen Trial&lt;/a&gt;. He was hanged on 7 June 1951 at &lt;a href=\"Landsberg%20Prison\"&gt;Landsberg Prison&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Rasch\"&gt;Otto Rasch&lt;/a&gt; was also indicted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial but his case was discontinued for health reasons, and he died in prison in 1948. &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Jeckeln\"&gt;Friedrich Jeckeln&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of war crimes by a Soviet military tribunal in the &lt;a href=\"Riga%20Trial\"&gt;Riga Trial&lt;/a&gt;, sentenced to death, and hanged on 3 February 1946. &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Eberhard\"&gt;Kurt Eberhard&lt;/a&gt; was arrested by US authorities but committed suicide while in custody in 1947.\nIn January 1946, 15 former members of the German police were tried in Kyiv over their role in their massacre. &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Koch\"&gt;Erich Koch&lt;/a&gt;, who had been \"&lt;a href=\"Reichskommissar\"&gt;Reichskommissar&lt;/a&gt;\" of Ukraine at the time, was tried and sentenced to death by a Polish court for his atrocities in occupied Poland, though he was never tried for his crimes in occupied Ukraine. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he died in prison in 1986.\nTwo additional perpetrators were given prison sentences at the &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg%20Trials\"&gt;Nuremberg Trials&lt;/a&gt;. In 1967, 11 men were charged for participating in the massacre in a German court in &lt;a href=\"Darmstadt\"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;. After a 14 month trial, seven were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging between four and fifteen years. In 1971 three more former German police officials were put on trial in &lt;a href=\"Regensburg\"&gt;Regensburg&lt;/a&gt;. The vast majority of the perpetrators were never tried for their roles in the massacre.\nRemembrance.\nAfter the war, specifically Jewish commemoration efforts encountered serious difficulty because of the Soviet Union's policies. &lt;a href=\"Yevgeny%20Yevtushenko\"&gt;Yevgeny Yevtushenko&lt;/a&gt;'s 1961 poem on Babi Yar begins \"Nad Babim Yarom pamyatnikov nyet\" (\"There are no monuments over Babi Yar\"); it is also the first line of Shostakovich's &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20No.%2013%20%28Shostakovich%29\"&gt;Symphony No. 13&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number of memorials have been erected on the site and elsewhere. The events also formed a part of literature. Babi Yar is located in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; at the juncture of today's &lt;a href=\"Kurenivka\"&gt;Kurenivka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lukianivka\"&gt;Lukianivka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syrets\"&gt;Syrets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Kyiv\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;, between Kyrylivska, Melnykov and Olena Teliha streets and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Cyril%27s%20Monastery%20%28Kyiv%29\"&gt;St. Cyril's Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Revolution\"&gt;Orange Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Yushchenko\"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; of Ukraine hosted a major commemoration of the 65th anniversary in 2006, attended by Presidents &lt;a href=\"Moshe%20Katsav\"&gt;Moshe Katsav&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Filip%20Vujanovic\"&gt;Filip Vujanovic&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stjepan%20Mesi%C4%87\"&gt;Stjepan Mesi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Rabbi\"&gt;Chief Rabbi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aviv\"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; Rabbi &lt;a href=\"Yisrael%20Meir%20Lau\"&gt;Yisrael Meir Lau&lt;/a&gt;. Rabbi Lau pointed out that if the world had reacted to the massacre of Babi Yar, perhaps the Holocaust might never have happened. Implying that Hitler was emboldened by this impunity, Lau speculated:\nIn 2006, a message was also delivered on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Kofi%20Annan\"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary-General of the United Nations, by his representative, &lt;a href=\"Resident%20Coordinator\"&gt;Resident Coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Martin%20O%27Donnell\"&gt;Francis Martin O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt;, who added a Hebrew prayer Shalom, from the Mourners' &lt;a href=\"Kaddish\"&gt;Kaddish&lt;/a&gt;.\nMudslide.\nBabi Yar was also the site of a large &lt;a href=\"mudslide\"&gt;mudslide&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1961. An earthen dam in the ravine had held &lt;a href=\"loam\"&gt;loam&lt;/a&gt; pulp that had been pumped from the local &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; factories for ten years without sufficient drainage. The dam collapsed after heavy rain, inundating the lower-lying &lt;a href=\"Kurenivka\"&gt;Kurenivka&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood. The death toll was estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 people."
