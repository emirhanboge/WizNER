    "text": "German submarine \"U-862 was a &lt;a href=\"Type%20IX%20U-boat\"&gt;Type IXD2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. After Germany's surrender in May 1945, \"U-862\" put into &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy&lt;/a&gt; under the name I-502\".\n\"U-862\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 15 August 1942 by &lt;a href=\"DeSchiMAG\"&gt;DeSchiMAG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AG%20Weser\"&gt;AG Weser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 7 October 1943 with \"&lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Timm\"&gt;Heinrich Timm&lt;/a&gt; in command. Timm commanded \"U-862\" for her entire career in \"Kriegsmarine\", receiving a promotion to \"&lt;a href=\"Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Korvettenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" on 1 July 1944. \"U-862\" conducted two patrols, sinking seven ships totalling 42,374 tons.\nDesign.\n&lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine%23Type%20IXD\"&gt;German Type IXD2 submarines&lt;/a&gt; were considerably larger than the original &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine\"&gt;Type IX&lt;/a&gt;s. \"U-862\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20hull\"&gt;pressure hull&lt;/a&gt; length of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a height of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by two &lt;a href=\"MAN%20SE\"&gt;MAN&lt;/a&gt; M 9 V 40/46 &lt;a href=\"supercharged\"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; four-stroke, nine-cylinder &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s plus two &lt;a href=\"MWM%20GmbH\"&gt;MWM&lt;/a&gt; RS34.5S six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines for cruising, producing a total of for use while surfaced, two &lt;a href=\"Siemens-Schuckert\"&gt;Siemens-Schuckert&lt;/a&gt; 2 GU 345/34 &lt;a href=\"Motor%E2%80%93generator\"&gt;double-acting electric motors&lt;/a&gt; producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-862\" was fitted with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 24 &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, one &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20C/32%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK C/32 naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, 150 rounds, and a &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20Flak%2018/36/37/43\"&gt;Flak M42&lt;/a&gt; with 2575 rounds as well as two &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft guns with 8100 rounds. The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of fifty-five.\nService history.\nFirst patrol.\n\"U-862\" was one of the most travelled of all &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt;s. She sailed from Germany in May 1944 and eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt;, in Japanese-controlled &lt;a href=\"British%20Malaya\"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt;, in September 1944. Penang was the base for the 33rd U-boat Flotilla, code-named \"&lt;a href=\"Monsun%20Gruppe\"&gt;Monsun Gruppe&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Monsoon Group\").\nOn the way there, she launched a &lt;a href=\"G7es%20torpedo\"&gt;T5/G7es \"Zaunk\u00f6nig I\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"acoustic%20torpedo\"&gt;acoustic homing torpedo&lt;/a&gt; at a tanker. The Zaunk\u00f6nig came around full circle to home in on \"U-862\". Only an emergency crash dive and staying silent saved the U-boat from her own torpedo. She also shot down an Allied &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina\"&gt;Consolidated PBY Catalina&lt;/a&gt; aircraft H of &lt;a href=\"No.%20265%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 265 Squadron RAF&lt;/a&gt; on 20 August 1944 and then escaped an intense search for her. She sank several merchant ships in the &lt;a href=\"Mozambique%20Channel\"&gt;Mozambique Channel&lt;/a&gt; between Africa and &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond patrol.\n\"U-862\" departed for her second war patrol from &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Batavia&lt;/a&gt; in the Japanese-occupied &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Netherlands East Indies&lt;/a&gt; in December 1944. She sailed down the west coast of Australia, across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Australian%20Bight\"&gt;Great Australian Bight&lt;/a&gt;, around the southern coast of &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; and then north towards &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; where she sank the U.S.-registered &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20ship\"&gt;Liberty ship&lt;/a&gt; on 25 December 1944. She then travelled around New Zealand and entered the port of &lt;a href=\"Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Napier&lt;/a&gt; at night undetected. This has given birth to an urban legend in New Zealand, where it is said that the captain of \"U-862\" sent sailors ashore at night to steal fresh milk from a farm. This may arise from a joke made by Captain Timm to Air Vice Marshal Sir &lt;a href=\"Rochford%20Hughes\"&gt;Rochford Hughes&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1950s. \"U862\"'s voyage to New Zealand was portrayed in a stage comedy \"U Boat Down Under\" which was written and directed by Peter Tait and performed at &lt;a href=\"Downstage%20Theatre\"&gt;Downstage Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington from 27 July to 5 August 2006.\n\"U-862\" then returned to the Indian Ocean. On 6 February 1945, about 1,520\u00a0km (820\u00a0nm) south-west of &lt;a href=\"Fremantle\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;, \"U-862\" sank the U.S.-registered Liberty ship, , which was loaded with &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s bound for &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"U-862\" was also a trial boat for the FuMo 65 \"Hohentwiel\" &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; system. This was cranked out of a casing on the port side of the conning tower and rose on a mast. The aerial was hand trained onto targets whilst the U-boat was on the surface. The radar had a range up to and was very effective where there was little risk from air attack on the U-boat.\nTransfer to Japan.\nWhen Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, she put into &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 July 1945 she became the IJN submarine \"I-502\". The \"I-502\" surrendered at Singapore in August 1945 and was scuttled in the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; at on 13 February 1946.\nThe German crew of \"U-862\" suffered no casualties, and some returned to Germany several years after the war. Others who were interned at &lt;a href=\"Kinmel%20Camp\"&gt;Kinmel Camp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bodelwyddan\"&gt;Bodelwyddan&lt;/a&gt;, North Wales, remained in Wales and settled in the neighbouring communities of &lt;a href=\"Rhyl\"&gt;Rhyl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhuddlan\"&gt;Rhuddlan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prestatyn\"&gt;Prestatyn&lt;/a&gt;, due to the risks of returning to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20zone\"&gt;Soviet occupied areas&lt;/a&gt; of Germany after the war. Two of the crew are buried at the new cemetery at Rhuddlan, North Wales, on nearby plots."
