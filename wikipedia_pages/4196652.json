    "text": "WEVU-LP, &lt;a href=\"VHF\"&gt;VHF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Analog%20television\"&gt;analog&lt;/a&gt; channel 4, was a &lt;a href=\"Low-power%20broadcasting%23Television\"&gt;low-powered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"television%20station\"&gt;television station&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20license\"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Fort Myers, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The station was owned by &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Point%20Capital\"&gt;Silver Point Capital&lt;/a&gt;, and was a &lt;a href=\"Broadcast%20relay%20station%23Satellite%20stations\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Univision\"&gt;Univision&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WUVF-LP\"&gt;WUVF-LP&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCaloosa Television, the owners of &lt;a href=\"WZVN-TV\"&gt;WEVU&lt;/a&gt; (channel 26) in &lt;a href=\"Naples%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Naples, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, was awarded a construction permit for a new low-power TV station in Fort Myers on December 16, 1986. The station went on the air in August 1988 as W07BR (a.k.a.WBR) on channel 7, after Tim Pipher sought out the unused permit; Pipher owned a minority stake and also gave up his Canadian citizenship to be able to own the station. At the time, with no &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; team in Florida, the station was able to affiliate with the networks of multiple Major League teams, carrying as many as 188 games a year. In the baseball offseason, WBR carried &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Myers%20Sun%20Sox\"&gt;Fort Myers Sun Sox&lt;/a&gt; games, using just one camera, plus college sports from several teams, &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Heat\"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; basketball, and other syndicated sports fare, plus a local sports talk call-in show, \"Southwest Florida Sportsline\", hosted by Pipher and former WEVU sports anchor Chris Barnes. Non-sports programming came from &lt;a href=\"Channel%20America\"&gt;Channel America&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the station was no longer able to obtain the baseball rights after the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Marlins\"&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt; began play, WBR shifted its focus to community programs and launched a repeater, W09BS channel 9 in &lt;a href=\"Naples%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;. In 1994, local output included karaoke and gospel shows, a Spanish-language newscast, and community discussion programs; at other times, the station aired &lt;a href=\"National%20Empowerment%20Television\"&gt;National Empowerment Television&lt;/a&gt; programming. On September 1, 1995, W07BR became WBRP-LP, while W09BS became WBSP-LP.\nJust one month after the adoption of the WBRP and WBSP call letters, WEVU\u2014which Caloosa had sold in 1991\u2014became &lt;a href=\"WZVN-TV\"&gt;WZVN-TV&lt;/a&gt;. Caloosa promptly reclaimed the WEVU-LP call letters on November 6, 1995.\nIn March 1998, WTVK (now &lt;a href=\"WXCW\"&gt;WXCW&lt;/a&gt;), at that time the &lt;a href=\"UPN\"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt; affiliate, dropped UPN for &lt;a href=\"The%20WB%20Television%20Network\"&gt;The WB&lt;/a&gt;. The original WB affiliate, cable-only \"WB 10\" (owned by &lt;a href=\"MediaOne\"&gt;MediaOne&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Comcast\"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt;, and branded with the faux calls of \"&lt;a href=\"WNFM-TV\"&gt;WSWF&lt;/a&gt;\") picked up UPN. However, not everyone in the market could get \"TV 10\" (as it was later called), so UPN also made an affiliation deal with WEVU, which would allow for wider coverage.\nIt wasn't until later in 1998 when Caloosa Television made a deal with MediaOne to have the cable system take over the station's programming. MediaOne dropped the faux call letters of \"WSWF\" in favor of WEVU and incorporated WEVU-LP's local programming into their lineup, thus unifying the UPN affiliates in the market. WEVU moved to channel 4 in 2001 and WBSP to channel 7, due to digital television shuffles; WBSP had to move off channel 9 to allow &lt;a href=\"WINK-TV\"&gt;WINK-TV&lt;/a&gt; to begin digital broadcasts on the channel.\nThis working relationship lasted until midnight on September 1, 2004. This occurred shortly after Caloosa struck a deal for carriage of the station (then known on-the-air as \"UPN 8\") on &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;. This forced WEVU to seek UPN programming via microwave from UPN &lt;a href=\"owned-and-operated%20station\"&gt;owned-and-operated station&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WTOG\"&gt;WTOG&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida\"&gt;St. Petersburg, Florida&lt;/a&gt;; they also aired WTOG's three-hour &lt;a href=\"E/I\"&gt;E/I&lt;/a&gt; block. All other programming on the station consisted of &lt;a href=\"infomercial\"&gt;infomercial&lt;/a&gt;s. Comcast continued to operate its own UPN affiliate, which began going by the faux call letters of \"&lt;a href=\"WNFM-TV\"&gt;WNFM&lt;/a&gt;\". WEVU was later picked up by &lt;a href=\"Dish%20Network\"&gt;Dish Network&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen UPN ended broadcasting in September 2006, WEVU filled the time slot with more infomercials. By this time, the stations had been sold to &lt;a href=\"Equity%20Media%20Holdings\"&gt;Equity Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and were simulcasting the six o'clock news from &lt;a href=\"Univision\"&gt;Univision&lt;/a&gt; affiliate and sister station &lt;a href=\"WUVF-LP\"&gt;WUVF-CA&lt;/a&gt;. Equity subsequently decided to rebroadcast WUVF's entire schedule on WEVU (since WEVU, unlike WUVF, is available via &lt;a href=\"Direct%20broadcast%20satellite\"&gt;DBS&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 2007, Equity struck a deal with LatinAmerican Broadcasting to carry &lt;a href=\"LAT%20TV\"&gt;LAT TV&lt;/a&gt; on its group of stations beginning May 30, 2007; WEVU was to be one of the stations. However, WEVU continued to rebroadcast WUVF.\nWBSP signed off March 11, 2008 after suffering technical problems.\nOn April 4, 2008, Equity announced the sale of all five of its Southwest Florida stations (including WEVU and WBSP) to Luken Communications, LLC for $8 million. Equity cited corporate financial losses as a reason for the sale. However, Equity Media Holdings entered &lt;a href=\"chapter%2011\"&gt;chapter 11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; that December, and offers by Luken Communications to acquire Equity-owned stations in six markets were withdrawn.\nWEVU was sold at auction to &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Point%20Capital\"&gt;Silver Point Capital&lt;/a&gt; on April 16, 2009. The sale closed on August 17, 2009. WBSP was not named in the sale. WEVU then surrendered its previous &lt;a href=\"Class%20A%20television%20service\"&gt;class A&lt;/a&gt; classification, which it had held since 2002.\nThree days before the completion of the sale to Silver Point, WEVU was taken silent. As a result, &lt;a href=\"Dish%20Network\"&gt;Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; began to obtain WUVF's programming via another satellite station, &lt;a href=\"WUVF-LP\"&gt;WLZE-LP&lt;/a&gt; (channel 51), on October 7, 2009. On March 10, 2011, WEVU-LP's license was cancelled by the FCC. WBSP's license had been cancelled on June 15, 2010."
