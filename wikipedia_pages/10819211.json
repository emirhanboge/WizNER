    "text": "Gary Etherington (born April 22, 1958 in England) is a retired English-American &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; player who began his professional career in the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%281968%E2%80%9384%29\"&gt;North American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; before moving to the &lt;a href=\"MISL%20I\"&gt;Major Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;. He earned seven &lt;a href=\"cap%20%28sports%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"USMNT\"&gt;U.S. national team&lt;/a&gt;. Since retiring, Etherington has coached youth soccer and is a soccer equipment salesman.\nYouth.\nEtherington was born in England but migrated to the U.S. with his family when he was fifteen. His family settled in Virginia where he attended &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Vernon%20High%20School%20%28Virginia%29\"&gt;Mount Vernon High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alexandria%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Alexandria, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, playing both soccer and as a &lt;a href=\"placekicker\"&gt;placekicker&lt;/a&gt; on his high school &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team. Etherington was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20U-20%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States U-20 men's national soccer team&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 as it attempted to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"1977%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship\"&gt;1977 FIFA World Youth Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Etherington scored six goals to go with striker partner &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Davis\"&gt;Rick Davis&lt;/a&gt; who scored eight. Despite their outstanding production, the U.S. finished third in the CONCACAF and did not qualify for the tournament.\nIn 1976, The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League sign 18-year-old Gary Etherington. The previous spring he was on the Annandale, Virginia team that beat Westport in overtime, in Westport, in the Eastern U.S. finals, then went on to capture what is now the U-19 McGuire Cup national championship. The Annandale Cavaliers defeated Fountain Valley, California 4\u20130 in the semi-finals and Sparta of Chicago (3\u20130) in the finals. Future Cosmos teammate Ricky Davis played for Fountain Valley.\nNASL.\nAfter graduating from high school, Etherington chose to bypass college and turn professional. He signed with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Cosmos%20%281971%E2%80%9385%29\"&gt;New York Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%281968%E2%80%9384%29\"&gt;North American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 as an amateur player and saw time in ten games that year. However, 1978 was considered his first professional season with the Cosmos. As such, he earned NASL Rookie of the Year honors that season. Etherington remained with the Cosmos for only one more season before being traded to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Aztecs\"&gt;Los Angeles Aztecs&lt;/a&gt; before the 1980 season. While Etherington had begun as a forward with the Cosmos, his lack of production had led to his move to the midfield. When the Aztecs traded Etherington to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Earthquakes%20%281974%E2%80%9388%29\"&gt;San Jose Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 1980 season, Etherington found himself at right back for the 1981 season. However, in 1982, he was back in the midfield. Etherington moved once more, this time to the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Strikers\"&gt;Minnesota Strikers&lt;/a&gt; for the 1984 NASL season, the last for the league as it folded at the end of the season.\nMISL.\nThe Earthquakes entered &lt;a href=\"MISL%20I\"&gt;Major Indoor Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; for the 1982\u20131983 indoor season. Etherington began the season with San Jose, but on January 20, 1983, the Earthquakes traded Etherington and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Hill%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Gordon Hill&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Arrows\"&gt;New York Arrows&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Zungul\"&gt;Steve Zungul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"https%3A//query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D9807EFD91138F933A15752C0A965948260\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the time the Earthquakes played in both the NASL and MISL while the Arrows played exclusively in the MISL. With this move, Etherington got his first taste of indoor soccer. The Arrows folded at the end of the 1983\u20131984 season and Etherington moved to the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Strikers\"&gt;Minnesota Strikers&lt;/a&gt; for the 1984 NASL outdoor season. When the NASL collapsed in 1984, the Strikers moved to MISL. Etherington remained with the Strikers and spent the next four seasons with them playing indoor soccer. In 1987, he played in the MISL All Star game. In 1988, Etherington moved to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Sockers%20%281974%E2%80%9396%29\"&gt;San Diego Sockers&lt;/a&gt; for one last season before retiring from playing professionally. He had knee surgery during the pre-season, came back to play ten games then retired in January 1989.\nNational team.\nEtherington earned seven &lt;a href=\"cap%20%28sports%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"USMNT\"&gt;U.S. national team&lt;/a&gt; between 1977 and 1979. His first match came in a 2\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;. He played sporadically throughout 1977, then started all three U.S. games in 1978. His last match came in the first U.S. game of 1979, a February 3 loss to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost\u2013playing career.\nSince retiring from playing professionally, Etherington has been involved in numerous ventures related to soccer. He co-founded the Murrieta Soccer Club in 1992, coaching the club's youth teams for five years. He has also spent several years in adult leagues in northern California.\nEtherington has been a regional sales manager for soccer equipment and clothing companies, including &lt;a href=\"Umbro\"&gt;Umbro&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, Etherington was inducted into the Virginia Soccer Hall of Fame.&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20110707234422/http%3A//www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php%3Farticle_id%3D8637\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"
