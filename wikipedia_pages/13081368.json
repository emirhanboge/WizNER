    "text": "Ormont is an \"&lt;a href=\"Ortsgemeinde\"&gt;Ortsgemeinde&lt;/a&gt;\" (a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Germany\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; belonging to a \"&lt;a href=\"Verbandsgemeinde\"&gt;Verbandsgemeinde&lt;/a&gt;\", a kind of collective municipality) situated in the &lt;a href=\"Vulkaneifel\"&gt;Vulkaneifel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Gerolstein%20%28Verbandsgemeinde%29\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Gerolstein&lt;/a&gt;, whose seat is in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Gerolstein\"&gt;Gerolstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nIt is often supposed that Ormont's name is of &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; origin (\"or\" = \u201cgold\u201d; \"mont\" = \u201cmountain\u201d), but this is not so. In the \"Liber Aureus\", the \u201cGolden Book\u201d of the town of &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%BCm\"&gt;Pr\u00fcm&lt;/a&gt;, is a boundary description for the centres of &lt;a href=\"Olzheim\"&gt;Olzheim&lt;/a&gt; and Ormont. Here, the village is called \"Aurimuncio\", in &lt;a href=\"Mediaeval%20Latin\"&gt;Mediaeval Latin&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, this does have the same literal meaning as the supposed French derivation (\"aurum\" = \u201cgold\u201d; \"mons/montem\" = \u201cmountain\u201d). Either way, therefore, the municipality's name means \u201cGold Mountain\u201d.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe municipality lies at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Schneifel\"&gt;Schneifel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vulkan%20Eifel\"&gt;Vulkaneifel&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the &lt;a href=\"Eifel\"&gt;Eifel&lt;/a&gt; known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.\nGeology.\n&lt;a href=\"Geology\"&gt;Geologically&lt;/a&gt; interesting is the Goldberg, a local mountain whose name, like Ormont's own, means \u201cGold Mountain\u201d, but in &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;Modern High German&lt;/a&gt;. The former &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; is the Vulkaneifel's westernmost outlier. Its name comes from the many &lt;a href=\"biotite\"&gt;biotite&lt;/a&gt; crystals that glitter in the sun. In the local folkspeech, these have been given the name \"Katzengold\" (\u201ccat gold\u201d), although this is actually a name given several minerals in German, including &lt;a href=\"Pyrite\"&gt;fool's gold&lt;/a&gt;. Now and then, &lt;a href=\"olivine\"&gt;olivine&lt;/a&gt; nodules can also be found. Since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the volcano's lava has been intensively quarried.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; times a road led from &lt;a href=\"Losheim%20am%20See\"&gt;Losheim&lt;/a&gt; to Ormont, which to this day bears the name \"Walenstra\u00dfe\". The word \"Walen\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20High%20German\"&gt;Old High German&lt;/a&gt; \"walahisc\", which meant \u201c&lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt;- (but originally &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20languages\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;-) speaking\u201d. It is &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; word \u201cWelsh\u201d.\nIn 893, Ormont had its first documentary mention when &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%BCm%20Abbey\"&gt;Pr\u00fcm Abbey&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s directory of holdings, the \"Pr\u00fcmer Urbar\", said that all inhabitants of \"Oremunte\" were to make &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt; for Pr\u00fcm Abbey.\nThe boundary description mentioned above (see Name), however, is believed to date from 801, but this cannot be definitively confirmed. What can be said, though, is that Ormont can look back on a history more than 1,200 years old.\nIn the directory of holdings from 1222, the reader learns that the Count of Vianden was enfeoffed by the Pr\u00fcm Church with \u201cthe estate at \"Oremunte\"\u201d. Almost a century later, in 1320, Friedrich II of Blankenheim was enfeoffed by King &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;John of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;, who was also &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Luxembourg\"&gt;Duke of Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, with the village of \"Oyrmunde\". Friedrich's wife was \u201cElse, Frau von Neuenstein\u201d (see Neuenstein below).\nIn 1329, the brothers Arnold I and Gerhard V of Blankenheim bought the estate of Neuenstein (as discussed later, the &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; had not yet been built). Ever since, Neuenstein's history has been bound with Ormont's. In the early 14th century, Ormont was therefore Luxembourgish domain and was held by the Lords of Blankenheim as a fief.\nIn 1361, Ormont and Neuenstein passed by way of exchange to Johann I of Schleiden and his brother Konrad of Schleiden, Provost at St. Gereon in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. About 1365, Konrad built Castle Neuenstein.\nIn 1450, Ormont and Neuenstein changed lords once again, ending up under the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Manderscheid\"&gt;Counts of Manderscheid-Schleiden&lt;/a&gt;. They were a mighty and influential dynasty with good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; court, and they significantly shaped the &lt;a href=\"Eifel\"&gt;Eifel&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s history in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this comital line died out in 1593, Count Philipp von der Mark held Ormont and Neuenstein unrightfully for the next 20 years. From 1613 to 1719, the two centres were held by the House of Manderscheid-Gerolstein (Kronenburg). From 1719 on, they were then held by Manderscheid-Blankenheim-Gerolstein (Kronenburg).\nThe last regent was Augusta, Imperial Countess at Manderscheid. She fled in 1794 before &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; troops with her husband, Christian von Sternberg, to his holdings in &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the autumn of 1794, the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; occupied Ormont and Neuenstein. Ormont was grouped into the Department of &lt;a href=\"Ourthe%20%28department%29\"&gt;Ourthe&lt;/a&gt; in the Arrondissement of Malmedy and the Canton of Kronenburg. More locally, it was administered by the \"Mairie\" (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Hallschlag.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in 1814 and 1815, the village passed to &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20Province\"&gt;Rhine Province&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a self-administering municipality in the \"Amtsbezirk\" of Stadtkyll in the Pr\u00fcm district.\nLate in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the village sustained heavy damage during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge\"&gt;Battle of the Bulge&lt;/a&gt;. The local soldiers\u2019 graveyard recalls this difficult time of war in early 1945.\nIn the course of administrative restructuring in &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; in 1970, Ormont passed to the &lt;a href=\"Obere%20Kyll\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Obere Kyll&lt;/a&gt;, and ever since it has belonged to the Daun district, which has since been given the name &lt;a href=\"Vulkaneifel\"&gt;Vulkaneifel&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeuenstein.\nAbout 1300, an \u201cElse, Frau von Neuenstein\u201d crops up in the archives. If this Else was an hereditary daughter of a Lord of Neuenstein, then the House of Neuenstein would be traceable back to the 13th century. However, Else seems to have had no strong link to Neuenstein. When her husband, Friedrich II of Blankenheim, died, she sold the Neuenstein estate in 1329 to Arnold I and Gerhard V of Blankenheim. Arnold's grandson, Gerhard VI of Blankenheim exchanged Neuenstein and Ormont in 1361 for other landholdings.\nThe new owners were Johann I of Schleiden and his brother Konrad of Schleiden, Provost at St. Gereon in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. On a conical hill, high above the &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%BCm%20%28river%29\"&gt;river Pr\u00fcm's&lt;/a&gt; left bank, about 1365, Konrad built Castle Neuenstein. Whatever his spiritual leanings were, Konrad was also a fervent warrior. The &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; served him in defending his estate against his Blankenheim cousins, with whom he was at war. Surrounding the castle were broad moats, which were fed by the river Pr\u00fcm. The castle could be entered behind a wall from the east. In 1370, Provost Konrad died, whereupon the new owner became Konrad V of Schleiden. He openly styled himself \u201cLord of Ormont and Neuenstein\u201d.\nIn 1397, the Cologne Council sent a \u201cJohann von Neuenstein\u201d to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; encampment at &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;. In 1413, a \u201cDr. jur. Johann von Neuenstein\u201d also crops up. Also witnessed in written records are Wolf Ludwig von Neuenstein, Hermann Dietrich von Neuenstein and Georg von Neuenstein.\nIn 1794, &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; troops burnt Castle Neuenstein down and sold it off as a quarry. Scant remnants of the foundations are all that can be found today.\nPolitics.\nMunicipal council.\nThe council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by &lt;a href=\"Plurality%20voting%20system\"&gt;majority vote&lt;/a&gt; at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\nMayor.\nOrmont's mayor is Andreas Maus.\nCoat of arms.\nThe German blazon reads: \"Unter goldenem Zackenschildhaupt und \u00fcber goldenem Bogenschildfu\u00df (Berg), darin ein roter Drachenkopf, der mit einem roten Kreuzstab bedeckt ist, in Rot f\u00fcnf (2:1:2) silberne Kugeln, begleitet rechts und links von je einer goldenen Gleve.\"\nThe municipality's &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;arms&lt;/a&gt; might in English &lt;a href=\"Heraldry\"&gt;heraldic&lt;/a&gt; language be described thus: Gules five plates, two, one and two, between two glaives Or in fess, the whole between a chief indented and in base a mount of the second, the latter charged with a dragon's head erased surmounted by a Latin cross of the first.\nOrmont and the outlying centre of Neuenstein belonged in &lt;a href=\"Feudalism\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; times to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Manderscheid\"&gt;County of Manderscheid&lt;/a&gt;. The \u201cchief indented\u201d \u2013 the stripe across the top of the &lt;a href=\"escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;escutcheon&lt;/a&gt; with the sawtooth lower edge \u2013 is a reference to the arms borne by those counts, whose arms were actually &lt;a href=\"charge%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;d with a fess dancetty of four (see the article about the county to see the Manderscheid arms). Konrad of Schleiden, builder of Castle Neuenstein, bore arms charged with golden &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;s (a &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;mediaeval&lt;/a&gt; pole weapon). The five \u201cplates\u201d (silver roundels, or in this case balls or orbs, as the German blazon has it) are taken from a seal used by a Johann von Neuenstein. The golden mount symbolizes the Goldberg, a mountain in the municipality whose name has the same meaning as the municipality's &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;-derived name, and the charge is therefore also &lt;a href=\"Canting%20arms\"&gt;canting&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon's head and the Latin cross are &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20the%20Virgin\"&gt;Saint Margaret's&lt;/a&gt; attributes, thus representing the municipality's and the church's patron saint.\nThe proposal for and the design of the arms came from Herbert Blum. The arms have been borne since 1992."
