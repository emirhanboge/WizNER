    "text": "Westernization(or Westernisation), also &lt;a href=\"Europeanisation\"&gt;Europeanisation&lt;/a&gt; or occidentalization(from \"&lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;the Occident&lt;/a&gt;\"), is a process whereby &lt;a href=\"Society\"&gt;societies&lt;/a&gt; come under or adopt &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western culture&lt;/a&gt; in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Manufacturing\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lifestyle%20%28sociology%29\"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Social%20norm\"&gt;norms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mores\"&gt;mores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Convention%20%28norm%29\"&gt;customs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tradition\"&gt;tradition&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Value%20%28ethics%29\"&gt;values&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mentality\"&gt;mentality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"perception\"&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diet%20%28nutrition%29\"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"writing%20system\"&gt;writing system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Western%20philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"colonialism\"&gt;colonialism&lt;/a&gt; it often involved the spread of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWesternization has been a growing influence across the world in the last few centuries, with some thinkers assuming Westernization to be the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Modernization%20theory\"&gt;modernization&lt;/a&gt;, a way of thought that is often debated. The overall process of Westernization is often two-sided in that Western influences and interests themselves are joined with parts of the affected society, at minimum, to change towards a more Westernized society, with the putative goal of attaining a Western life or some aspects of it, while Western societies are themselves affected by this process and interaction with non-Western groups.\nWesternization traces its roots back to &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; would take on the first process of Westernization as it was heavily influenced by Greece and created a new culture based on the principles and values of the Ancient Greek society. The Romans emerged with a culture that would lay the new foundations of Europe and grow into a new Western identity based on the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Roman%20world\"&gt;Greco-Roman&lt;/a&gt; society.\nWesternization can also be compared to &lt;a href=\"acculturation\"&gt;acculturation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"enculturation\"&gt;enculturation&lt;/a&gt;. Acculturation is \"the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between cultural groups and their individual members.\" After contact, changes in cultural patterns are evident within \"one\" or \"both\" cultures. Specific to Westernization and the non-Western culture, foreign societies tend to adopt changes in their own social systems relative to Western ideology, lifestyle, and physical appearance, along with numerous other aspects, and shifts in culture patterns can be seen to take root as a community becomes acculturated to Western customs and characteristics \u2013 in other words, Westernized.\nThe phenomenon of Westernization does not follow any one specific pattern across societies as the degree of adaption and fusion with Western customs will occur at varying magnitudes within different &lt;a href=\"communities\"&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the extent to which domination, destruction, resistance, survival, adaptation or modification affect a native culture may differ following inter-ethnic contact.\nDefinition.\nCountries part of the West.\nThe \"West\" was originally defined as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt;. A thousand years later, the &lt;a href=\"East-West%20Schism\"&gt;East-West Schism&lt;/a&gt; separated the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; from each other. The definition of Western changed as the West was influenced by and spread to other nations. Islamic and Byzantine scholars added to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20canon\"&gt;Western canon&lt;/a&gt; when their stores of Greek and Roman literature jump-started the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; also reinterpreted the definition of the West by excluding the countries of the former &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt;. Today, most modern uses of the term refer to the societies in the West and their close &lt;a href=\"genealogical\"&gt;genealogical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"natural%20language\"&gt;linguistic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"philosophical\"&gt;philosophical&lt;/a&gt; descendants, typically included are those countries whose ethnic identity and dominant culture are derived from &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Western European culture&lt;/a&gt;. However, though sharing in a similar historical background, it would be incorrect to regard the Western world as a monolithic bloc, as many cultural, linguistic, religious, political, and economical differences exist between Western countries and populations.\nCountries significantly influenced by westernization.\nThe following countries or regions experienced a significant influence by the process of Westernization:\nDifferent views.\nKishore Mahbubani and westernization.\n&lt;a href=\"Kishore%20Mahbubani\"&gt;Kishore Mahbubani&lt;/a&gt;'s book entitled \"The Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One World\" (Public Affairs), is very optimistic. It proposes that a new global civilization is being created. The majority of non-Western countries admire and adhere to Western living standards. However, he warns us that this newly emerging global order has to be ruled through new policies and attitudes. He argues that the policymakers all over the world must change their preconceptions and accept that we live in one world. The national interests must be balanced with global interests and the power must be shared. Mahbubani urges that only through these actions can we create a world that converges benignly.\nHe states there is conflict between \"the West and the Rest.\" and offers three forms of general action that non-Western civilizations can react toward Western countries.\nThe end of westernizationMahbubani counters this argument in his other book, \"The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East\". This time, he argues that Western influence is now \"unraveling\", with &lt;a href=\"March%20to%20Modernity\"&gt;Eastern powers&lt;/a&gt; such as China arising. He states:\n He goes on further to explain the decline of Western influence, stating reasons as to the loss of Western credibility with the rest of the world.\nSamuel P. Huntington and westernization.\nIn contrast to territorial delineation, others, like the American &lt;a href=\"political%20scientist\"&gt;political scientist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20P.%20Huntington\"&gt;Samuel P. Huntington&lt;/a&gt; \"(see &lt;a href=\"The%20Clash%20of%20Civilizations\"&gt;The Clash of Civilizations&lt;/a&gt;)\", consider what is \"Western\" based on religious affiliation, such as deeming the majority-&lt;a href=\"Western%20Christianity\"&gt;Western Christian&lt;/a&gt; part of Europe and North America the West, and creating 6 other civilizations, including &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confucian\"&gt;Confucian&lt;/a&gt;, Japanese, &lt;a href=\"Islamic\"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Slavic-Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, to organize the rest of the globe.\nFurthermore, Huntington claims that after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;cold war&lt;/a&gt;, world politics had been moved into a new aspect in which non- Western civilizations were no more the exploited recipients of Western civilization but become another important actor joining the West to shape and move the world history.\nHuntington believed that while the age of &lt;a href=\"ideology\"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt; had ended, the world had only reverted to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\nEdward Said and westernization.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Orientalism%20%28book%29\"&gt;Orientalism&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Said\"&gt;Edward Said&lt;/a&gt; views Westernization as it occurred in the process of &lt;a href=\"colonization\"&gt;colonization&lt;/a&gt;, an exercise of essentializing a \"subject race\" in order to more effectively dominate them. Said references &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Balfour\"&gt;Arthur Balfour&lt;/a&gt;, the British Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905, who regarded the rise of nationalism in Egypt in the late 19th century as counterproductive to a \"benevolent\" system of occupational rule. Balfour frames his argument in favor of continued rule over the Egyptian people by appealing to England's great \"understanding\" of Egypt's civilization and purporting that England's cultural strengths complemented and made them natural superiors to Egypt's racial deficiencies. Regarding this claim, Said says, \"Knowledge to Balfour means surveying a civilization from its origins to its prime to its decline \u2013 and of course, it means being able to...The object of such knowledge is inherently vulnerable to scrutiny; this object is a \u2018fact' which, if it develops, changes, or otherwise transforms itself...[the civilization] nevertheless is fundamentally, even ontologically stable. To have such knowledge of such a thing is to dominate it.\" The act of claiming coherent knowledge of a society in effect objectifies and others it into marginalization, making people who are classified into that race as \"almost everywhere nearly the same.\" Said also argues that this relationship to the \"inferior\" races, in fact, works to also fortify and make coherent what is meant by \"the West\"; if \"The Oriental is irrational, depraved (fallen), childlike, \"different...\" then \"...the European is rational, virtuous, mature, normal.\" Thus, \"the West\" acts as a construction in the similar way as does \"the Orient\" \u2013 it is a created notion to justify a particular set of power relations, in this case the colonization and rule of a foreign country.\nProcess of westernization.\nColonization (1400s\u20131970s).\nEuropeanization.\nFrom 1400s onward, &lt;a href=\"Europeanization\"&gt;Europeanization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"colonialism\"&gt;colonialism&lt;/a&gt; spread gradually over much of the world and controlled different regions during this five centuries long period, &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20colonialism\"&gt;colonizing or subjecting&lt;/a&gt; the majority of the globe.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Western leaders and academics sought to expand innate liberties and international equality. A period of &lt;a href=\"decolonization\"&gt;decolonization&lt;/a&gt; began. At the end of the 1960s, most colonies were allowed autonomy. Those new states often adopted some aspects of Western &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; such as a constitution, while frequently reacting against Western culture.\nWesternization in Asia.\nGeneral reactions to Westernization can include &lt;a href=\"fundamentalism\"&gt;fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protectionism\"&gt;protectionism&lt;/a&gt; or embrace to varying degrees. Countries such as &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; attempted to adopt a system of &lt;a href=\"isolationism\"&gt;isolationism&lt;/a&gt; but have ultimately juxtaposed parts of Western culture into their own, often adding original and unique social influences, as exemplified by the introduction of over 1,300 locations of the traditionally Western fast-food chain &lt;a href=\"McDonald%27s\"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt; into China. Specific to &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, the industry of bridal photography (see &lt;a href=\"Photography%20in%20Taiwan\"&gt;Photography in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;) has been significantly influenced by the Western idea of \"love\". As examined by author Bonnie Adrian, Taiwanese bridal photos of today provide a striking contrast to past accepted norms, contemporary couples often displaying great physical affection and, at times, placed in typically Western settings to augment the modernity, in comparison to the historically prominent relationship, often stoic and distant, exhibited between bride and groom. Though Western concepts may have initially played a role in creating this cultural shift in Taiwan, the market and desire for bridal photography has not continued without adjustments and social modifications to this Western notion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the first contact with Westernization was during the &lt;a href=\"Chosun%20Dynasty\"&gt;Chosun Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, in 17th century. Every year, the emperor would dispatch few envoy ambassadors to China and while they were staying in Beijing, the Western missionaries were there. Through the missionaries, Korean ambassadors were able to adopt the Western technology. In 19th century, Korea started to send ambassadors to the foreign countries, other than Japan and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. While Korea was being Westernized slowly in late 19th century, Korea had the idea of \"Eastern ways and Western frames (\u6771\u9053\u897f\u5668)\", meaning that they would accept the Western \"bowl\", but use it with Eastern principles inside.\nIn Japan, the Netherlands continued to play a key role in transmitting Western know-how to the Japanese from the 17th century to the mid-19th century, because the Japanese had only opened their doors to Dutch merchants before US Navy &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20C.%20Perry\"&gt;Commodore Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Expedition\"&gt;visit in 1853&lt;/a&gt;. After Commodore Perry's visit, Japan began to deliberately accept Western culture to the point of hiring Westerners to teach Western customs and traditions to the Japanese starting in the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20era\"&gt;Meiji era&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, many Japanese politicians have encouraged the Westernization of Japan with the use of the term \"&lt;a href=\"Datsu-A%20Ron\"&gt;Datsu-A Ron&lt;/a&gt;\", which means the argument for \"leaving Asia\" or \"Good-bye Asia\". In \"Datsu-A Ron\", \"Westernization\" was described as an \"unavoidable\" but \"fruitful\" change. However, in contrast, despite many advances in industrial efficiency, Japan has managed to sustain a culture of strict social hierarchy and limited individualization.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, the process of Westernization dates back to the country's attempt to westernize during the beginning in the 1930s, which was dictated by &lt;a href=\"Rez%C4%81%20Sh%C4%81h\"&gt;Shah Rez\u0101 Khan&lt;/a&gt; and continued by &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Reza%20Pahlavi\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt; during the Cold War and agitated the largely conservative &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shia Muslim&lt;/a&gt; masses of the country, was partly responsible for the 1979 &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Revolution\"&gt;Iranian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, the process of Westernization dates back to the 19th century, known as the &lt;a href=\"Tanzimat\"&gt;Tanzimat&lt;/a&gt; \"(reorganization)\" period. The &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; began to change itself according to western science, practice and culture. The Empire took some innovations from the West. Also, by the contribution of foreign engineers the Empire repaired its old arm systems. Newly-found schools, permanent ambassadors, and privy councils were essential improvement for the Empire. The Westernization efforts continued under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt;, with the adaptation of the &lt;a href=\"Latin-script%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin-script alphabet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9\"&gt;French concept of secularism&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Turkey is one of the most Westernized majority-Muslim nations.\nGlobalization (1970s\u2013present).\nWesternization is often regarded as a part of the ongoing process of &lt;a href=\"globalization\"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt;. This theory proposes that Western thought has led to globalisation, and that globalisation propagates Western culture, leading to a cycle of Westernization. On top of largely Western government systems such as &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, many Western technologies and customs like music, clothing and cars have been introduced across various parts of the world and copied and created in traditionally non-Western countries.\nHowever, Westernization has been also reversed in some countries following wars or changes in regime, for example: &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; excluding &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; after 1949, Cuba after the Revolution in 1959, South Vietnam after communist takeover in 1975, Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion and Iran after the 1979 revolution.\nThe main characteristics are economic and political (&lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt;) democratisation, combined with the spread of an &lt;a href=\"Individualism\"&gt;individualised culture&lt;/a&gt;. Often it was regarded as opposite to the worldwide influence of &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;break-up&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; in late-1991 and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, many of its component states and allies nevertheless underwent Westernization, including &lt;a href=\"privatization\"&gt;privatization&lt;/a&gt; of hitherto state-controlled industry.\nWith debates still going on, the question of whether globalization can be characterized as Westernization can be seen in various aspects. Globalization is happening in various aspects, ranging from economics, politics and even to food or culture. Westernization, to some schools, is seen as a form of globalization that leads the world to be similar with Western powers. Being globalized means taking positive aspects of the world, but globalization also brings about the debate about being Westernized. Democracy, fast foods, and American pop-culture can all be examples that are considered as Westernization of the world.\nAccording to the \"Theory of the Globe scrambled by Social network: a new Sphere of Influence 2.0\", published by &lt;a href=\"Jura%20Gentium\"&gt;Jura Gentium&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Florence\"&gt;University of Florence&lt;/a&gt;), an increasing role in Westernisation is ruled by &lt;a href=\"Social%20Media\"&gt;Social Media&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison with Eastern realities, who decided to ban the American Social Medias (as Iran and Mainland China with Facebook, Twitter), marks a political desire to avoid the process of Westernisation of own population and way to communicate.\nConsequences.\nDue to the colonization of the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans, the cultural, ethnic and linguistic make-up of the Americas and Oceania has been changed. This is most visible in settler colonies such as: &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and even, to a lesser extent, some &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n countries: &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, where the traditional &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples\"&gt;indigenous population&lt;/a&gt; has been predominantly replaced demographically by non-indigenous settlers due to transmitted disease and conflict. This demographic takeover in settler countries has often resulted in the linguistic, social, and cultural marginalisation of indigenous people. However, even in countries where large populations of indigenous people remain or the indigenous peoples have mixed (&lt;a href=\"mestizo\"&gt;mestizo&lt;/a&gt;) considerably with European settlers, such as: &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belize\"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honduras\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador\"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, relative marginalisation still exists.\nDue to colonization and immigration, the formerly prevalent languages in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and part of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, are now usually Indo-European languages or creoles based on them:\nMany indigenous languages are on the verge of becoming extinct. However, some settler countries have gone to lengths to preserve indigenous languages; for example, in New Zealand the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20language\"&gt;M\u0101ori language&lt;/a&gt; is one of three official languages, the others being English and New Zealand sign language, another example is Ireland, where &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; is the first official language, followed by English as the second official language."
