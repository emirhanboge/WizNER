After a stay at &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;, he signed in 1987 for &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. Over nearly a decade at &lt;a href=\"Molineux%20Stadium\"&gt;Molineux&lt;/a&gt;, Venus was an integral part of the club's resurrection after bankruptcy. Playing &lt;a href=\"left%20back\"&gt;left back&lt;/a&gt; and, occasionally in his preferred position of &lt;a href=\"Central%20defender\"&gt;central defence&lt;/a&gt;, Venus helped Wolves to Divisions &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Division%20Four\"&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Division%20Three\"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; championships.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 after being exchanged for &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Sedgley\"&gt;Steve Sedgley&lt;/a&gt;. With Ipswich Town he won the 1999\u20132000 First Division play-offs, and then finished 5th in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

He was given a &lt;a href=\"free%20transfer%20%28football%29\"&gt;free transfer&lt;/a&gt; by Ipswich Town &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Royle\"&gt;Joe Royle&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2002\u201303.\nWhilst playing for &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambridge United&lt;/a&gt; in 2003\u201304, he fell out with the club and played the rest of that season on loan to &lt;a href=\"Dagenham%20%26amp%3B%20Redbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Dagenham &amp; Redbridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nVenus was hired as &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; assistant manager by his former Ipswich Town teammate &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Mowbray\"&gt;Tony Mowbray&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Venus also registered as a player for Hibs, but played in only one match before ending his playing career. Their contracts were extended in September 2006.\nVenus returned to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20conurbation\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; in October 2006 by following Mowbray to &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;. Their first game in charge was a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Country%20derby\"&gt;Black Country derby&lt;/a&gt; against Wolves, where Venus had spent the bulk of his playing career. They had their contract extended until June 20111 in February 2008.\nVenus was appointed &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; assistant manager on 16 June 2009, again following Mowbray. After Mowbray was sacked as &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; manager in March 2010, Venus and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Grant%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29\"&gt;Peter Grant&lt;/a&gt; also left the club.\nVenus was appointed assistant manager of &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; on 26 October 2010, working again with Mowbray. After Mowbray was sacked by Middlesbrough in October 2013, Venus was made caretaker manager. Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson commented that Venus was on the shortlist of candidates to be the next permanent manager. On 25 October he led Middlesbrough to a 4\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers. Mark Venus' tenure as caretaker manager came to an end on 13 November when Aitor Karanka was appointed as the new Middlesbrough head coach.\nVenus joined Coventry City in June 2015 as technical director. After the resignation of Tony Mowbray on 29 September 2016 he was made caretaker manager.\nPersonal life.\nTwo medals awarded to Venus were stolen during a break-in at his house in the &lt;a href=\"Morningside%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Morningside&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; on 29 December 2010.\nHonours.\nIpswich Town\nIndividual"
