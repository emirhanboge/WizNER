Humanity has disappeared and only robots remain. Players make their mission through the world of pixelated parallax to find Poncho's maker and save humanity. The gameplay consists of a 2D &lt;a href=\"Platform%20game\"&gt;platformer&lt;/a&gt; with different layer of depth, being able to get closer or further away.\nReception.\nThe PC version has been reviewed on &lt;a href=\"Destructoid\"&gt;Destructoid&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 60/100.

Hardcore Gamer compared the game to &lt;a href=\"Fez%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game was a commercial failure. In a blog post at &lt;a href=\"Gamasutra\"&gt;Gamasutra&lt;/a&gt; published over a year after the game's release, Dan Hayes, a developer at Delve stated their company had \"not yet made a single penny from \"Poncho\"\". He further blamed Rising Star Games for a lack of support; the publisher responded by stating that Delve had consistently missed milestones."
