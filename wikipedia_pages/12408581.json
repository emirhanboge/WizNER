Though born in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, he has been based in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20California\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; throughout his ongoing career as a &lt;a href=\"session%20musician\"&gt;session musician&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"songwriter\"&gt;songwriter&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly career.\nBiondo played &lt;a href=\"bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; area band called Storybook People during which time they released a &lt;a href=\"single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Dunhill%20Records\"&gt;Dunhill Records&lt;/a&gt;, which received limited &lt;a href=\"airplay%20%28radio%29\"&gt;airplay&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles. In 1968, Biondo replaced &lt;a href=\"Nick%20St.%20Nicholas\"&gt;Nick St. Nicholas&lt;/a&gt; in another Los Angeles area band called T.I.M.E., when St. Nicholas departed for Steppenwolf. After T.I.M.E. guitarist Larry Byrom also left to join Steppenwolf, T.I.M.E. briefly attempted to carry on with Biondo as lead &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt;, but never released any further &lt;a href=\"sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction\"&gt;recordings&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteppenwolf.\nIn early 1970, Biondo replaced St. Nicholas a second time when he joined Steppenwolf for the recording of \"&lt;a href=\"Steppenwolf%207\"&gt;Steppenwolf 7&lt;/a&gt;\", contributing lead vocals on \"Fat Jack\" and co-lead vocals on \"Foggy Mental Breakdown\" and the chart-hit, \"Who Needs Ya'\".
