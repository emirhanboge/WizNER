    "text": "The Kydoniai Division () was an &lt;a href=\"infantry%20division\"&gt;infantry division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Army\"&gt;Hellenic Army&lt;/a&gt;, active in 1920 during the &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Minor%20Campaign\"&gt;Asia Minor Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20landing%20at%20Smyrna\"&gt;Greek landing at Smyrna&lt;/a&gt; on 2 May 1919, and the establishment of an &lt;a href=\"Smyrna%20Zone\"&gt;occupation zone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ionia\"&gt;Ionia&lt;/a&gt;, the Kydoniai Division, named after the Greek name of the town of &lt;a href=\"Ayvali\"&gt;Ayvali&lt;/a&gt;, began formation in January 1920. Its core was provided by the independent &lt;a href=\"31st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;31st Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Doiran\"&gt;Lake Doiran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"32nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;32nd Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt; detached from the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;8th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ioannina\"&gt;Ioannina&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Smyrna%20Guard%20Regiment\"&gt;Smyrna Guard Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, which was renamed into the &lt;a href=\"33rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;33rd Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. Following completion of its formation in February, the division became part of the &lt;a href=\"Smyrna%20Army%20Corps\"&gt;Smyrna Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;. The division's first and only commander was Colonel &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Othonaios\"&gt;Alexandros Othonaios&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 14\u201320 September, the larger part of the division was shipped to Greece to provide guards for the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%201920\"&gt;November 1920 elections&lt;/a&gt;. The units that remained behind were amalgamated with the &lt;a href=\"Crete%20Division\"&gt;Crete Division&lt;/a&gt; that was transferred to Asia Minor at the same time. Following the elections, the division returned to Asia Minor, only to be abolished: the headquarters were merged with those of the Crete Division, while the 31st and 32nd Regiments were disbanded and merged into the 33rd Regiment, which also became part of the Crete Division, which in turn was renamed as the &lt;a href=\"5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;5th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;."
