    "text": "Ponce de Leon Heights is a historic neighborhood in the west section &lt;a href=\"Decatur%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Decatur&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, USA. It includes single family residences and a church, primarily built in the early 1900s. The neighborhood is located between Scott Blvd. to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Ponce%20de%20Leon%20Avenue\"&gt;Ponce de Leon Avenue&lt;/a&gt; to the south and Coventry Road to the east. Although the neighborhood partially fronts on Ponce de Leon Avenue, there are no commercial businesses.\nArchitecture.\nThe name of the community is apparently derived from fronting on the north side of Ponce de Leon Avenue, and from the hilly terrain of west Decatur. Ponce de Leon Heights homes were primarily constructed starting in 1914, sit on small lots and include many examples of &lt;a href=\"American%20Craftsman\"&gt;Craftsman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bungalows\"&gt;bungalows&lt;/a&gt; architectural style. Streets in the community include Clarion Ave., Nelson Ferry Rd., Woodlawn Ave., Fairfield St. and the southeast leg of Coventry Rd.\nAlthough not directly connected to the other neighborhood roads, Pinetree Dr. falls within the greater community boundaries. However, homes and lots on Pinetree Dr. are substantially larger than neighboring roads. This street is architecturally distinct from the other streets, and a parcel adjoining Ponce de Leon Ave. was developed as cluster housing.\nParks.\nPonce de Leon Heights does not have a City of Decatur or DeKalb County park. However, the church playground at Nelson Ferry Rd. &amp; Northern Ave. is open to residents."
