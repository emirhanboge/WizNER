    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Braathens\"&gt;Braathens&lt;/a&gt; (until 1998 known as Braathens SAFE) was a Norwegian &lt;a href=\"airline%20timetable\"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"charter%20airline\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; airline that operated from 1946 to 2004. The airline used 53 airports serving 50 destinations, 23 of which were in Norway and 6 in Sweden. Braathens provided international services to 24 airports serving 22 cities in 17 countries. Seven of these cities are in Asia, the rest in Europe. In addition, Braathens served numerous destinations as both a regular and an ad-hoc charter airline. Braathens' main hubs were &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Fornebu\"&gt;Oslo Airport, Fornebu&lt;/a&gt; (1949\u201398), &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Gardermoen\"&gt;Oslo Airport, Gardermoen&lt;/a&gt; (1998\u20132007) and &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20Arlanda%20Airport\"&gt;Stockholm Arlanda Airport&lt;/a&gt; (1997\u201399). The main technical base was at &lt;a href=\"Stavanger%20Airport%2C%20Sola\"&gt;Stavanger Airport, Sola&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe destinations in Asia were served from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, and did not have international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Area\"&gt;European Economic Area&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997, it bought &lt;a href=\"Transwede\"&gt;Transwede&lt;/a&gt; and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of &lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20Airlines%20System\"&gt;Scandinavian Airlines System&lt;/a&gt; (SAS) in 2004 to create &lt;a href=\"SAS%20Braathens\"&gt;SAS Braathens&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBraathens SAFE started as a charter airline, flying predominantly to the Far East and South America. In 1949, the airline was granted a concession on the Far East route that was flown until 1954, using &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20DC-4\"&gt;Douglas DC-4&lt;/a&gt;s. The main airport in Norway was &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Fornebu\"&gt;Oslo Airport, Fornebu&lt;/a&gt;, and the main technical base was at &lt;a href=\"Stavanger%20Airport%2C%20Sola\"&gt;Stavanger Airport, Sola&lt;/a&gt;. From 1952 to 1960, the airline cooperated on flights to &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; with the Icelandic airline &lt;a href=\"Loftleidir\"&gt;Loftleidir&lt;/a&gt;. Braathens SAFE started domestic services in 1951, using &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Heron\"&gt;de Havilland Heron&lt;/a&gt;s on a route from Oslo via &lt;a href=\"T%C3%B8nsberg\"&gt;T\u00f8nsberg&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stavanger\"&gt;Stavanger&lt;/a&gt;. Services from Oslo to &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt; were introduced in 1953. This was supplemented with stops in &lt;a href=\"Farsund\"&gt;Farsund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, and &lt;a href=\"Hamar\"&gt;Hamar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B8ros\"&gt;R\u00f8ros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Notodden\"&gt;Notodden&lt;/a&gt; the following year. However, with the delivery of the &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20F-27\"&gt;Fokker F-27&lt;/a&gt;s, many of the smaller airports were cut from the service. The airline started flying from Oslo to &lt;a href=\"%C3%85lesund\"&gt;\u00c5lesund&lt;/a&gt; and along the &lt;a href=\"West%20Norway\"&gt;West Coast&lt;/a&gt; in 1958. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to &lt;a href=\"Sandefjord\"&gt;Sandefjord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aalborg\"&gt;Aalborg&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark. Services to &lt;a href=\"Bod%C3%B8\"&gt;Bod\u00f8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Troms%C3%B8\"&gt;Troms\u00f8&lt;/a&gt; started in 1967, and &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737\"&gt;Boeing 737-200s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20F-28\"&gt;Fokker F-28&lt;/a&gt;s were taken into use two years later. &lt;a href=\"Kristiansund\"&gt;Kristiansund&lt;/a&gt; was added as a destination in 1970 and &lt;a href=\"Molde\"&gt;Molde&lt;/a&gt; two years later. The F-28s were retired in 1986, while services to &lt;a href=\"Longyearbyen\"&gt;Longyearbyen&lt;/a&gt; started the following year.\nFrom 1987, Braathens SAFE was allowed to make international scheduled flights on certain routes. From 1989 to 1993, it opened routes to &lt;a href=\"Billund%2C%20Denmark\"&gt;Billund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6\"&gt;Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;, London and &lt;a href=\"Murmansk\"&gt;Murmansk&lt;/a&gt;. In the same period, the airline replaced its fleet with &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737%20Classic\"&gt;Boeing 737-400 and -500s&lt;/a&gt;. The Norwegian airline market was deregulated in 1994, and Braathens SAFE was free to fly on any domestic and international route; it immediately opened routes to &lt;a href=\"Harstad\"&gt;Harstad&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Narvik\"&gt;Narvik&lt;/a&gt;. Within two years, international routes had been started to &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nice\"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; and Rome. In 1996, Braathens bought Sweden's second-largest airline, &lt;a href=\"Transwede%20Airways\"&gt;Transwede Airways&lt;/a&gt;, and started a route to &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, Transwede was merged into Braathens SAFE, and the airline took over its domestic routes to &lt;a href=\"Halmstad\"&gt;Halmstad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping\"&gt;J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lule%C3%A5\"&gt;Lule\u00e5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sundsvall\"&gt;Sundsvall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ume%C3%A5\"&gt;Ume\u00e5&lt;/a&gt;, using Transwede's &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20100\"&gt;Fokker 100&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1997, &lt;a href=\"KLM\"&gt;KLM&lt;/a&gt; bought part of Braathens SAFE, and the two started a partnership; Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's &lt;a href=\"airline%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation\"&gt;Boeing 737-700s&lt;/a&gt; were taken into use starting in 1998, and the company rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Gardermoen\"&gt;Oslo Airport, Gardermoen&lt;/a&gt;, which increased Braathens number of &lt;a href=\"landing%20slot\"&gt;slots&lt;/a&gt; and allowed them to start a new route to &lt;a href=\"Haugesund\"&gt;Haugesund&lt;/a&gt;. Braathens started a costly price war with its competitors &lt;a href=\"Color%20Air\"&gt;Color Air&lt;/a&gt; and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20Aviation\"&gt;Malm\u00f6 Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1laga\"&gt;M\u00e1laga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alicante\"&gt;Alicante&lt;/a&gt; were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the &lt;a href=\"SAS%20Group\"&gt;SAS Group&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted new services to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Norway\"&gt;Northern Norway&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Alta%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bardufoss\"&gt;Bardufoss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirkenes\"&gt;Kirkenes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lakselv\"&gt;Lakselv&lt;/a&gt;. Braathens was merged with SAS to create &lt;a href=\"SAS%20Braathens\"&gt;SAS Braathens&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\nDestinations.\nThe list shows airports that have been served by Braathens as part of its scheduled services between 1949 and 2004.
