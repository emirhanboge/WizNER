    "text": "The American Federation of Actors (AFA) was an early &lt;a href=\"actor\"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"labor%20union\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. It was supported by &lt;a href=\"Sophie%20Tucker\"&gt;Sophie Tucker&lt;/a&gt; who was elected as the union's president in 1938. In 1939, the AFA was disbanded by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Federation%20of%20Labor\"&gt;American Federation of Labor&lt;/a&gt; for financial mismanagement. The AFL subsequently issued a charter to the succeeding &lt;a href=\"American%20Guild%20of%20Variety%20Artists\"&gt;American Guild of Variety Artists&lt;/a&gt;, with some AFA members joining the &lt;a href=\"Actors%27%20Equity%20Association\"&gt;Actors' Equity Association&lt;/a&gt;."
