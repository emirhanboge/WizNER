    "text": "The parliamentary election for the &lt;a href=\"9th%20legislature%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran\"&gt;9th Islamic Consultative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, or Majlis, were held in &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, 2 March 2012 with a second round on 4 May 2012 in those 65 districts where no candidate received 25% or more of the votes cast. More than 5,000 candidates registered but more than a third were disqualified by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Council\"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt; leaving about 3,400 candidates to run for the 290 seat representing the 31 provinces.\nThe election has been described by journalists and analysts \"as a contest between\" Iran's &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Leader%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Supreme Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Khamenei\"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; and president &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad\"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, with Khamenei supporters winning a large majority of seats. Iranian officials and state media have described the election as a sign of Iranians' trust in the Islamic Republic and a message to the West rejecting pressure over Iran's nuclear program. Although no final election turnout figures were released, state media emphasized that voter turnout was high.\nThe parliament has \"no direct control over key foreign and security policy matters\" but some influence over those policies and coming elections. In the wake of the crushing of &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%932010%20Iranian%20election%20protests\"&gt;reformist protest&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Iranian%20presidential%20election%23Irregularities\"&gt;2009 election results&lt;/a&gt;, few if any &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20reform%20movement\"&gt;reformist&lt;/a&gt; candidates were allowed by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Council\"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt; to run. The new parliament was opened on 27 May 2012.\nBackground.\nAfter two consecutive wins in &lt;a href=\"2004%20Iranian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2008%20Iranian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, the governing conservatives are hoping to secure yet another majority in the parliament.\nEvents since the 2008 election.\nThe 2008 election saw a majority win for the conservatives and supporters of &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Iran\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad\"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; but in the last years of the parliament, It was a despite with the president and the parliament, major in the budget approval. The parliament elected &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Larijani\"&gt;Ali Larijani&lt;/a&gt;, a former opponent of Ahmadinejad in the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2005 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; as the chairman. The first disagreement with the government was the vote of no confidence and dismissal of then Interior Minister, &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Kordan\"&gt;Ali Kordan&lt;/a&gt;, just three months after the opening of the new parliament. The presidential election was held in June 2009 in which Ahmadinejad was re-elected as the president. This was very despite with the results. Opposition &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%932010%20Iranian%20election%20protests\"&gt;repudiated&lt;/a&gt; the result and claimed that there was fraud in the election. The inauguration ceremony, held in parliament on 5 August 2009, was not attended by more than 60 of the 290 members of Parliament. Parliament also rejected three of the introduced ministers of Ahmadinejad's second cabinet.\nElectoral system.\nThe registration of candidates was handled by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Iran%29\"&gt;Interior Ministry&lt;/a&gt; and candidates are vetted by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Council\"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2007, Iran has been divided into 207 &lt;a href=\"electoral%20districts\"&gt;electoral districts&lt;/a&gt;. These districts are roughly based on geography, but shaped according to the number of voters so that each district holds roughly the same number of registered voters. 202 districts are Muslim majority and 5 districts belong to the recognized religious minorities. Therefore, these districts do not correspond to the borders of top administrative divisions within Iran and each district contains one or more or parts of several &lt;a href=\"provinces%20of%20Iran\"&gt;provinces of Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The legal term of the parliament is four years. The elections must be held before the dissolution of the parliament. The new members must be sworn three months after their elections in the first day of opening of the parliament. The speaker and deputy speakers are elected in the opening day. In the time of war and military occupation, after the proposal of the president and approval of three-fourths of the members of the parliament and approval of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Council\"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt;, elections can be postponed in the occupied areas or the entire country for a certain period.\nIf in a district, no one can earn \u00bc of the votes, a second round election will be held after four weeks. If an elected MP dies, resigns or leaves office for other reasons, Ministry of the Interior must hold the election in her/his districts in less than seven months. None of the candidates can nominate herself/himself in more than one district. If so, her/his candidacy will be canceled and they will be disenfranchised. Voting must be an official holiday.\nQualifications.\nAccording to Iran's law, in order to qualify as a candidate one must:\nCandidate will be disqualified if he/she is found to be mentally impaired, actively supporting the &lt;a href=\"Shah\"&gt;Shah&lt;/a&gt; or supporting political parties and organizations deemed illegal or been charged with anti-government activity, converted to another faith or has otherwise renounced the Islamic faith, have been found guilty of corruption, treason, fraud, bribery, is an addict or trafficker or have been found guilty of violating &lt;a href=\"Shariat\"&gt;Shariat&lt;/a&gt; law.\nCampaign.\nThe chief of the Council of Guardians, Ayatollah &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Jannati\"&gt;Ahmad Jannati&lt;/a&gt;, has said that reformists he labeled as traitors \"need not participate.\" Former president &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Khatami\"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt; demanded that political prisoners be freed and that former presidential candidates &lt;a href=\"Mir-Hossein%20Mousavi\"&gt;Mir-Hossein Mousavi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mahdi%20Karroubi\"&gt;Mahdi Karroubi&lt;/a&gt; be released from house arrest as a precondition for his movements participation. Since his call went unheeded &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Mohammad-Gharibani\"&gt;Ali Mohammad-Gharibani&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Reformist Front Coordination Council, said: \"Despite efforts...to create an appropriate election climate, unfortunately more restrictions have been imposed. Therefore, the council has decided that it won\u2019t issue any election list and won\u2019t support anyone.\" The electoral campaign was started on 23 February and ended on 1 March. Over 5,400 had registered to contest the 290 parliamentary seats. More than 47,000 polling stations will operate nationwide during the elections. Some 3.9 million people will cast their votes for the first time. According to Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry, the election process will be managed by some 850,000 observers in 47,000 polling stations and 1,000 constituencies across the country.\nRegistration and vetting of candidates.\nThe registration ran from 24\u201330 January 2012. 5,405 people applied at the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Iran%29\"&gt;Interior Ministry&lt;/a&gt; to stand as candidates. These included 490 women. 1,006 applied in Tehran. &lt;a href=\"North%20Khorasan%20Province\"&gt;North Khorasan Province&lt;/a&gt; had the smallest number with 39 people. The number of applications was down from the 2008 parliamentary elections when 7,597 applied. According to &lt;a href=\"Aljazeera\"&gt;Aljazeera&lt;/a&gt; commentators, the number of rejections\u2014including 33 sitting members of parliament\u2014can be attributed primarily to stricter educational requirements, and the narrowing of what is considered politically acceptable by the Guardian Council.\nBeginning with the 2012 elections, candidates have to have at least a master's degree to stand for elections, not just a Bachelors as in earlier elections. In addition candidate hopefuls may have been disqualified for affiliation with leftist organisations, the reformist camp, or even President Ahmadinejad.\nPolitical parties and coalitions.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Neil%20MacFarquhar\"&gt;Neil MacFarquhar&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", \"there are no real political parties in Iran, only murky, shifting alliances of political figures,\" but according to &lt;a href=\"Al%20Jazeera\"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, the vote is a contest between the &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20of%20Principlists\"&gt;United Front of Principlists&lt;/a&gt;, who support Supreme Leader Khamenei, and the &lt;a href=\"Front%20of%20Islamic%20Revolution%20Stability\"&gt;Front of Islamic Revolution Stability&lt;/a&gt;, which backs Ahmadinejad.\nReformists.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Council%20for%20coordinating%20the%20Reforms%20Front\"&gt;Council for coordinating the Reforms Front&lt;/a&gt; or simply \"Reforms Front\" (), the highest decision-making body inside &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20reform%20movement\"&gt;Iranian reform movement&lt;/a&gt;, called the elections 'illegal and unfair' and \u201cdecided not to present a unified list [of candidates] and not to support anyone [in the race].\u201d However, some member groups inside the council including &lt;a href=\"Worker%20House\"&gt;Worker House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Party%20%28Iran%29\"&gt;Democracy Party&lt;/a&gt;, and some individual reformists formed the \"Reformists Front\" () led by &lt;a href=\"Mostafa%20Kavakebian\"&gt;Mostafa Kavakebian&lt;/a&gt; to compete in the elections. Some reformist groups like &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Qom%20Seminary%20Scholars%20and%20Researchers\"&gt;Assembly of Qom Seminary Scholars and Researchers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Combatant%20Clerics\"&gt;Association of Combatant Clerics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Iran%20Participation%20Front\"&gt;Islamic Iran Participation Front&lt;/a&gt; ruled out any cooperation with this group, and some labeled them as \u201cfake reformists\u201d ().\nResults.\nAccording to the \"IranPolitik\", the results were:\nAccording to \"Mizan Online\", the official news agency of &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Judiciary\"&gt;Iranian Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;, 182 were &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Principlists\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, 13 were &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Reformists\"&gt;reformer&lt;/a&gt; and 88 were independent (excluding 5 religious minority members and 2 vacant seats).\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Stratfor\"&gt;Stratfor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20of%20Conservatives\"&gt;United Front of Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Front%20of%20Islamic%20Revolution%20Stability\"&gt;Stability Front&lt;/a&gt; won 98 and 43 seats respectively, while other political parties and independents took the rest.\nThe affiliations of candidates are determined on the basis of the candidacy lists in which their names appeared. Given the overlap of candidacy lists, the share of each group might be claimed more or less than what is in the table, which shows the results out of 225 confirmed seats. \nAnalysis.\nThe government hopes that the high turnout it claims will give it a boost. According to a statement issued on the Web site of the Foreign Ministry, by turning out in droves, Iranians \u201cespecially in this sensitive historical era, have shown that, despite all of the conspiracies, pressures, and sanctions, and the bleak portrait painted by the media of global arrogance, they will continue defending independence and the national interest.\u201d\nHowever, the foreign journalist &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Secor\"&gt;Laura Secor&lt;/a&gt; found a polling station in Tehran (&lt;a href=\"Hosseiniyeh%20Ershad\"&gt;Hosseiniyeh Ershad&lt;/a&gt;) where she had always seen long lines of voters in previous elections, nearly empty this year.\nMajid Zavari, a &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;-based political analyst, said the economy and the persistent unemployment would be pivotal issues in the election: \"From one end, Iranian society is facing high unemployment, particularly among educated youth who, despite university degrees, do not have decent living standards. This has increased discontent amongst people,\" Zavari told &lt;a href=\"Al%20Jazeera\"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to analyst, Maryam Khatibi, \"reformists are nowhere to be seen,\" in the election campaign. Nasser Karimi and Brian Murphy of the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; see the election as divided between pro-&lt;a href=\"Ahmadinejad\"&gt;Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; conservatives and pro-&lt;a href=\"Ali%20Khamenei\"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; conservatives.\nLiberals, reformists and youth groups that led the protests are virtually absent from the parliamentary ballots after relentless crackdowns and arrests. Conservatives \u2013 now left without a unifying foe \u2013 have splintered into various factions either backing or rejecting Ahmadinejad for daring to challenge Khamenei and the ruling clerics.\nHowever, Mohammad Khatami \u2014 former president of the Islamic Republic and the \"spiritual leader of the reformist movement\" \u2014 who had urged Iranians not to vote, did end up voting March 2.\nTurnout.\nAccording to the official accounts, out of 48,288,799 eligible voters, 26,472,760 turned out."
