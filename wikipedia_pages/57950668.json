    "text": "The Bayfield 30/32 is a Canadian &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt;, that was designed by &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Gozzard\"&gt;Ted Gozzard&lt;/a&gt; as a cruising boat and first built in 1973.\nFirst marketed as the Bayfield 30, the name was eventually change to the Bayfield 32 due to pressure from United States dealers who insisted on calling the boat a \"32\" based on its &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;LOA&lt;/a&gt;, which included the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29%23Types\"&gt;clipper bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bowsprit\"&gt;bowsprit&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of traditional design, modern construction, and roomy interiors for this size of the boat was popular from the start. More than 300 Bayfield 30/32s were built during their long production run.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Bayfield%20Boat%20Yard\"&gt;Bayfield Boat Yard&lt;/a&gt;, first in &lt;a href=\"Bayfield%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Bayfield, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, and later in &lt;a href=\"Clinton%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Clinton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Bayfield 30/32 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with wood trim. Most were built with a &lt;a href=\"cutter%20rig\"&gt;cutter rig&lt;/a&gt;, though a few &lt;a href=\"ketch\"&gt;ketch&lt;/a&gt;es were produced, with a sail area of . A small number of special, tall-rig sloops were built, with of additional mast height, and an extended bowsprit increasing the total sail area to . This version was sold as the Bayfield 32C.\nThe 30/32 featured a clipper bow, a bowsprit, wooden decorative &lt;a href=\"trailboard\"&gt;trailboard&lt;/a&gt;s on the bow, a keel-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed long &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;. The hulls were solid &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly heavy lay up with mat and woven roving. The deck was cored with 3/8th-inch balsa, while some high-load areas were cored with plywood. The 30/32 displaces and carries of internally mounted lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel and most boats were fitted with a Japanese &lt;a href=\"Yanmar\"&gt;Yanmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of two cylinders and or, less commonly three cylinders and , though a few early Bayfield 30/32s were fitted with a unique Sperry Vickers hydraulic drive and a few with &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; diesels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mainsheet%20traveller\"&gt;mainsheet traveller&lt;/a&gt; is mounted at the aft of the cockpit. The &lt;a href=\"staysail\"&gt;staysail&lt;/a&gt; has tracks mounted inboard and the &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20%28sail%29\"&gt;genoa&lt;/a&gt; has outboard tracks on the bulwarks. The cockpit has dual two-speed winches and dual single speed winches. The three &lt;a href=\"halyard\"&gt;halyard&lt;/a&gt; winches are mounted on the aft coach house roof.\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 228 with a high of 222 and low of 237. It has a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nAccommodations.\nThe accommodations include a forward cabin with a door and &lt;a href=\"Berth%20%28sleeping%29%23Beds%20in%20boats%20or%20ships\"&gt;\"V\"-berth&lt;/a&gt;. The door can close the cabin or the starboard-mounted &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;. The main cabin has three berths, a pull-out double berth and a quarter berth. The chart table stows in the cabin ceiling. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the starboard side and has a &lt;a href=\"stainless%20steel\"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; sink with a pressurized water supply, a two burner stove with oven, and a &lt;a href=\"ice%20box\"&gt;ice box&lt;/a&gt; that has a &lt;a href=\"teak\"&gt;teak&lt;/a&gt; ice grate. Originally the cabin was fitted with &lt;a href=\"dorade%20vent\"&gt;dorade vent&lt;/a&gt;s and an opening hatch, along with five fixed ports, and one opening port in the heads, though later boats had the number of port lights increased to eight.\nOperational history.\nIn a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"The Bayfield line of sailboats are dedicated cruising boats and aren't known for their outstanding performance. However, the Bayfield 32 equipped with a tall rig is supposed to be quite fast, although it will not point as high as a club racer with a fin keel. This boat has a shallow draft, a wide beam, and plenty of living space down below. The Bayfield 32 is a good looking boat with a distinctive appearance which sets it apart from the many look-alike boats that were manufactured in Canada in large numbers in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\nA 2010 review in \"Sailing\" magazine concluded, \"the Bayfield 32 is another example of why there's no excuse not to get out on the water. This sturdy, handsome, quality cruiser is an ideal family boat that will provide drama-free sailing for years to come.\"\nSee also.\nRelated development\nSimilar sailboats"
