This capped a meteoric rise, as Sloga played in the sixth division in 2014, receiving four consecutive promotions and obtaining a goal difference of 83:8 in the 2017\u201318 season.\nSloga finished second in the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20the%20Republika%20Srpska\"&gt;First League of RS&lt;/a&gt; in the 2018\u201319 season, 20 points behind the champions &lt;a href=\"FK%20Borac%20Banja%20Luka\"&gt;Borac Banja Luka&lt;/a&gt;.

Issues arose in the summer when the club had difficulty paying the 100,000\u00a0km guaranteed to secure their spot in the league. A number of players left over the summer due to financial issues as well. The league ultimately let the club participate, but the club's finances meant it ended up playing its juniors in the first two games of the season, losing 8\u20130 and 10\u20130 respectively. Sloga then failed to show up to their third-round game at home without requesting a postponement. The club finally withdrew from the league on 31 August 2019."
