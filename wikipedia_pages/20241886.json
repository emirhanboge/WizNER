SSK MB\" played their first &lt;a href=\"Czech%20handball\"&gt;Czech handball&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href=\"Ljudski%20vrt\"&gt;Ljudski vrt&lt;/a&gt; area. In 1928, the 1. SSK Maribor have won the national league. The first men's handball team, named \"Polet\", was formed in 1949. They were renamed to \"Branik\" in 1951, when they participated in the Yugoslav First League qualifiers. In 1954, Branik have won their first Slovenian Republic League title, and were promoted to the Yugoslav First League. The women's team have won the league one year later, in 1955. Between 1955 and 1968, Branik did not achieve any major success and were even relegated to the local &lt;a href=\"Styria%20%28Slovenia%29\"&gt;Styrian&lt;/a&gt; League in 1966, but returned to the top Slovenian division two years later. They were relegated again in 1972, but once again returned in 1979 after spending a few years in the local regional leagues. In 1977, the team was merged with Kovinar Tezno to form \"Maribor\". The team was struggling in the next decade and did not achieve any major results. After the independence of Slovenia, the team was reformed with a help from some former handball players, including Marko \u0160ibila. They reached the 3. DRL (Third National Handball League).\nMaribor Branik.\nIn 2003, a new club called Maribor Branik was founded. In their first season, the team was promoted to the 2. DRL East.

As he was also the owner of the air conditioning company Klima Petek, which was the main sponsor of the club, the fan group was composed of employees of the company. In 2010, when Andrej Bauman has been appointed a new director of Maribor Branik, the club gained a new group of fans, named Maribor Supporters, which supposedly consisted of the younger members of &lt;a href=\"Viole%20Maribor\"&gt;Viole Maribor&lt;/a&gt;, the supporters of &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"NK%20Maribor\"&gt;NK Maribor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 2012, members of the Maribor Supporters chanted a song about the &lt;a href=\"Srebrenica%20massacre\"&gt;Srebrenica massacre&lt;/a&gt; against the Bosnian team &lt;a href=\"RK%20Grada%C4%8Dac\"&gt;Grada\u010dac&lt;/a&gt; during the 2011\u201312 &lt;a href=\"EHF%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;EHF Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; match.

However, at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, RK Maribor Branik changed their main colour to purple due to popularity of &lt;a href=\"NK%20Maribor\"&gt;NK Maribor&lt;/a&gt;, the most successful &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; club in the country, which main colour is purple.
