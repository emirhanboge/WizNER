    "text": "Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius (c. 250 \u2013 c. 325) was an &lt;a href=\"early%20Christian\"&gt;early Christian&lt;/a&gt; author who became an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20emperor\"&gt;Roman emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I\"&gt;Constantine I&lt;/a&gt;, guiding his Christian religious policy in its initial stages of emergence, and a tutor to his son &lt;a href=\"Crispus\"&gt;Crispus&lt;/a&gt;. His most important work is the \"&lt;a href=\"Institutiones%20Divinae\"&gt;Institutiones Divinae&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Divine Institutes\"), an &lt;a href=\"Apologetics\"&gt;apologetic&lt;/a&gt; treatise intended to establish the reasonableness and truth of Christianity to pagan critics.\nHe is best known for his apologetic works, widely read during the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"humanists\"&gt;humanists&lt;/a&gt; who called Lactantius the \"Christian Cicero\". Also often attributed to Lactantius is the poem \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Phoenix%20%28Lactantius%20poem%29\"&gt;The Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;\", which is based on the myth of the &lt;a href=\"phoenix%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; from Oriental mythology. Though the poem is not clearly Christian in its motifs, modern scholars have found some literary evidence in the text to suggest the author had a Christian interpretation of the eastern myth as a symbol of resurrection.\nBiography.\nLactantius was of Punic or &lt;a href=\"Berbers\"&gt;Berber&lt;/a&gt; origin, born into a pagan family. He was a pupil of &lt;a href=\"Arnobius\"&gt;Arnobius&lt;/a&gt; who taught at &lt;a href=\"Sicca%20Veneria\"&gt;Sicca Veneria&lt;/a&gt;, an important city in &lt;a href=\"Numidia\"&gt;Numidia&lt;/a&gt;. In his early life, he taught rhetoric in his native town, which may have been &lt;a href=\"Cirta\"&gt;Cirta&lt;/a&gt; in Numidia, where an inscription mentions a certain \"L. Caecilius Firmianus\".\nLactantius had a successful public career at first. At the request of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20emperor\"&gt;Roman emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diocletian\"&gt;Diocletian&lt;/a&gt;, he became an official professor of rhetoric in &lt;a href=\"Nicomedia\"&gt;Nicomedia&lt;/a&gt;; the voyage from Africa is described in his poem \"Hodoeporicum\" (now lost). There, he associated in the imperial circle with the administrator and polemicist &lt;a href=\"Sossianus%20Hierocles\"&gt;Sossianus Hierocles&lt;/a&gt; and the pagan philosopher &lt;a href=\"Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29\"&gt;Porphyry&lt;/a&gt;; he first met &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galerius\"&gt;Galerius&lt;/a&gt;, whom he cast as villain in the &lt;a href=\"Persecutions%20of%20Diocletian\"&gt;persecutions&lt;/a&gt;. Having converted to Christianity, he resigned his post before Diocletian's purging of Christians from his immediate staff and before the publication of Diocletian's first \"Edict against the Christians\" (February 24, 303).\nAs a Latin \"rhetor\" in a Greek city, he subsequently lived in poverty according to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jerome\"&gt;Saint Jerome&lt;/a&gt; and eked out a living by writing until &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine I&lt;/a&gt; became his &lt;a href=\"patron\"&gt;patron&lt;/a&gt;. The persecution forced him to leave Nicomedia, perhaps re-locating to North Africa. The emperor &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt; appointed the elderly Lactantius Latin tutor to his son &lt;a href=\"Crispus\"&gt;Crispus&lt;/a&gt; in 309-310 who was probably 10-15 years old at the time. Lactantius followed Crispus to &lt;a href=\"Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt; in 317, when Crispus was made &lt;a href=\"Caesar%20%28title%29\"&gt;Caesar&lt;/a&gt; (lesser co-emperor) and sent to the city. Crispus was &lt;a href=\"death%20penalty\"&gt;put to death&lt;/a&gt; by order of his father &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I\"&gt;Constantine I&lt;/a&gt; in 326, but when Lactantius died and under what circumstances are unknown.\nWriting.\nLike so many of the early Christian authors, Lactantius depended on &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; models. &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jerome\"&gt;Saint Jerome&lt;/a&gt; praised his writing style while faulting his ability as a Christian apologist, saying: \"Lactantius has a flow of eloquence worthy of &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Tully&lt;/a&gt;: would that he had been as ready to teach our doctrines as to pull down those of others!\" Similarly, the early &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanists&lt;/a&gt; called him the \"Christian &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Cicero Christianus\"). A translator of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Divine%20Institutes\"&gt;Divine Institutes&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"Lactantius has always held a very high place among the Christian Fathers, not only on account of the subject-matter of his writings, but also on account of the varied erudition, the sweetness of expression, and the grace and elegance of style, by which they are characterized.\"\nHe wrote &lt;a href=\"apologetic\"&gt;apologetic&lt;/a&gt; works explaining &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; in terms that would be palatable to educated people who still practiced the &lt;a href=\"religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome\"&gt;traditional religions of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He defended Christian beliefs against the criticisms of &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20philosophy\"&gt;Hellenistic philosophers&lt;/a&gt;. His \"Divinae Institutiones\" (\"Divine Institutes\") were an early example of a systematic presentation of Christian thought.\nHe was considered somewhat &lt;a href=\"heresy\"&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt; after his death, but &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanist&lt;/a&gt;s took a renewed interest in him, more for his elaborately rhetorical Latin style than for his &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;. His works were copied in manuscript several times in the 15th century and were first printed in 1465 by the Germans &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Pannartz%20and%20Konrad%20Sweynheim\"&gt;Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim&lt;/a&gt; at the Abbey of &lt;a href=\"Subiaco%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Subiaco&lt;/a&gt;. This edition was the first book printed in Italy to have a date of printing, as well as the first use of a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek alphabet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"font\"&gt;font&lt;/a&gt; anywhere, which was apparently produced in the course of printing, as the early pages leave Greek text blank. It was probably the fourth book ever printed in Italy. A copy of this edition was sold at auction in 2000 for more than $1 million.\nProphetic exegesis.\nLike many writers in the first few centuries of the early church, Lactantius took a &lt;a href=\"Premillennialism\"&gt;premillennialist&lt;/a&gt; view, holding that the second coming of Christ will precede a millennium or a thousand-year reign of Christ on earth. According to Charles E. Hill, \"With Lactantius in the early fourth century we see a determined attempt to revive a more \u201cgenuine\u201d form of chiliasm.\" Lactantius quoted the &lt;a href=\"Sibyl\"&gt;Sibyl&lt;/a&gt;s extensively (although the &lt;a href=\"Sibylline%20Oracles\"&gt;Sibylline Oracles&lt;/a&gt; are now considered to be &lt;a href=\"pseudepigrapha\"&gt;pseudepigrapha&lt;/a&gt;). Book VII of \"The Divine Institutes\" indicates a familiarity with Jewish, Christian, Egyptian and Iranian apocalyptic material.\nAttempts to determine the time of the End were viewed as in contradiction to Acts 1:7: \"It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has established by his own authority,\" and Mark 13:32: \"But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\""
