    "text": "Emil \"Hill Billy\" Bildilli (September 16, 1912 \u2013 September 16, 1946) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in 41 &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; over all or part of five seasons for the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; (\u2013). A left-hander born in &lt;a href=\"Diamond%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Diamond, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, he was listed as tall and .\nPlaying career.\nMinor leagues.\nBildilli grew up in &lt;a href=\"Shepardsville%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Shepardsville&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vigo%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Vigo County, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, and attended &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20High%20School%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;Clinton High School&lt;/a&gt;. As a young man, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Terre Haute&lt;/a&gt;, where he played &lt;a href=\"semiprofessional\"&gt;semiprofessional&lt;/a&gt; baseball. In 1937, Terre Haute's Class B &lt;a href=\"Illinois-Indiana-Iowa%20League\"&gt;Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League&lt;/a&gt; team, the &lt;a href=\"Terre%20Haute%20Tots\"&gt;Tots&lt;/a&gt;, a Browns' &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm club&lt;/a&gt;, signed Bildilli, then 24, to his first pro contract. He appeared in 15 games and posted a 7\u20137 &lt;a href=\"win-loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;won\u2013lost record&lt;/a&gt; before the Tots folded on July 3. Bildilli then spent the rest of the 1937 minor-league campaign with the Class C &lt;a href=\"Johnstown%20Johnnies\"&gt;Johnstown Johnnies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Atlantic%20League\"&gt;Middle Atlantic League&lt;/a&gt;.\nMajor leagues.\nIn late August, he was recalled all the way to St. Louis, getting into four games for the 1937 Browns (with one &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt;), but he struggled, losing his only &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; with a 10.13 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt;.\nBildilli was back in the minor leagues for the bulk of 1938, but it was a banner year for him. He won 18 of 22 decisions for &lt;a href=\"Springfield%20Browns\"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt; of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League, and was effective in three appearances in the high-level &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Missions\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. He earned another late-season trial with the Browns, working in five games and recording his first &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; victory, but he remained ineffective, with 7.06 ERA. St. Louis sent him back to San Antonio in , where he helped pitch the Missions into the playoffs by winning 22 games, tied for tops in the Texas League. Back with the Browns for a third consecutive September stint, he posted two &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;s in as many starts and lowered his ERA to 3.32 in 19 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;, setting the stage for his season, Bildilli's only full year in the major leagues.\nAppearing in 28 games for a sixth-place &lt;a href=\"1940%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1940 Browns team&lt;/a&gt; that lost 87 games, Bildilli compiled a modest 2\u20134 won\u2013lost mark, and his earned run average was a poor 5.57. However, on April 30, 1940, at &lt;a href=\"Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and facing the defending world champion &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, Bildilli turned in a scintillating performance. After allowing &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; to the first two batters he faced\u2014a &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triple&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Crosetti\"&gt;Frankie Crosetti&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rolfe\"&gt;Red Rolfe&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Bildilli settled down and allowed only two more baserunners, both of whom he &lt;a href=\"base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walked&lt;/a&gt;. The Browns battled back to score two &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; in the middle innings, rewarding Bildilli with a two-hit, complete game 2\u20131 triumph.\nHe pitched only one more season in professional baseball. In 1941, after two early-season games and only 2 innings pitched, St. Louis sent him to &lt;a href=\"Toledo%20Mud%20Hens\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, their top affiliate, where he struggled to a 5\u20139 (5.57) record. He closed the book on a major league career that included a 4\u20138 record and 5.84 earned run average in 41 games, including 17 starts. He registered seven career complete games and one &lt;a href=\"save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt;. In 148 innings pitched, he surrendered 184 hits and 75 walks, with 55 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter pro baseball.\nIn 1942, Bildilli took a job with the fire department in &lt;a href=\"Muncie%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Muncie, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, and played &lt;a href=\"semi-professional\"&gt;semi-professional&lt;/a&gt;ly. After defeating a barnstorming team from the &lt;a href=\"Negro%20leagues\"&gt;Negro leagues&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Fort Wayne&lt;/a&gt; on September 14, 1946, he was driving home to Muncie when his car ran off the road and hit a tree. Bildilli suffered a fractured skull, and died two days later in &lt;a href=\"Hartford%20City%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Hartford City&lt;/a&gt; on his 34th birthday, leaving his wife and two children."
