    "text": "A Dienstmann (plural: \"Dienstleute\" or, in Austria, \"Dienstm\u00e4nner\") was a &lt;a href=\"medieval%20retainer\"&gt;medieval retainer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"vassal\"&gt;vassal&lt;/a&gt; and, later, a hired man, in German-speaking countries, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; until the first half of the 20th century.\nUsage.\nThe term \"Dienstmann\" first surfaced in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; as a Germanicization of the Latin word &lt;a href=\"ministerialis\"&gt;ministerialis&lt;/a&gt;, for men, who served at a court and, in the course of time, were raised to be &lt;a href=\"armiger\"&gt;armiger&lt;/a&gt;s with a social status similar to that of free &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Ritter\").\nHowever the term \"Dienstmann\" could also refer to men who were obliged to pay duties or render &lt;a href=\"socage\"&gt;socage&lt;/a&gt; to their &lt;a href=\"liege%20lord\"&gt;liege lord&lt;/a&gt;s a \"&lt;a href=\"socager\"&gt;socager&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"socman\". Unlike &lt;a href=\"ministeriales\"&gt;ministeriales&lt;/a&gt;, they held a lower social rank equivalent to the English &lt;a href=\"serf\"&gt;serf&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the term described was used to describe a hired man who, in public service or in a private household, was contracted to perform time-limited functions of all types in return for a fee. His main duties were the carriage of belongings, such as &lt;a href=\"suitcase\"&gt;suitcase&lt;/a&gt;s, and messenger duties.\nIn fiction.\nWell-known fictional \"Dienstm\u00e4nner\" are the \"Dienstmann\", Alois Hingerl, in &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Thoma\"&gt;Ludwig Thoma&lt;/a&gt;'s Satire \"Ein M\u00fcnchner im Himmel\" or &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Moser%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Hans Moser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20H%C3%B6rbiger\"&gt;Paul H\u00f6rbiger&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Dienstm\u00e4nner\" in the film \"Hallo Dienstmann\". As a so-called \"Berliner Original\", the \"Dienstmann\", Ferdinand Strumpf, went under the name, Eckensteher Nante."
