    "text": "Teversal Football Club are a semi-professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Teversal\"&gt;Teversal&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Mansfield\"&gt;Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. They play in the .\nHistory.\nA previous club, Teversal Miners Welfare, had existed in the town since the 1918, playing at the same Carnarvon Street ground as is used today, but had long since dropped to playing youth football by the time the current senior set up re-established in 1986, under the name M W Teversal. The closure of the two local collieries (Teversal and Silverhill) lead to a period of uncertainty, but the local &lt;a href=\"Ashfield%20District%20Council\"&gt;Ashfield District Council&lt;/a&gt; took over the trusteeship of the complex in 1989, with the name becoming the Teversal Grange Sports and Social Centre. The football club followed suit, changing the name to Teversal Grange. A further name-change took place in 2000 when they dropped the \"Grange\" to become simply Teversal F.C.\nUpon formation, Miners Welfare Teversal joined the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Midlands%20League\"&gt;Central Midlands League&lt;/a&gt;, winning that league's second division in their inaugural season. but dropped down to the more local &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire%20Alliance\"&gt;Nottinghamshire Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. After a spell of seven years in that company, but no league titles, they re-joined the Central Midlands in its lower Premier Division. The quality of the facilities available led to promotion to the Supreme Division in 2001, where they again consolidated for a period, this time four years, again without picking up the league title. Their third place in 2004\u201305 was enough however to merit a further promotion, and they commenced the 2006\u201307 campaign in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Counties%20East%20Football%20League\"&gt;Northern Counties East Football League&lt;/a&gt; Division One. The club competed in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 2003\u201304 and two seasons later they made their debut appearance in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2017 they were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"East%20Midlands%20Counties%20League\"&gt;East Midlands Counties League&lt;/a&gt;\nThe club play at Teversal Grange Sports and Social Centre."
