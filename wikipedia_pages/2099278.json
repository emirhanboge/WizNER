    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway\"&gt;London and North Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt; (LNER) J94 Class is a class of &lt;a href=\"steam%20locomotive\"&gt;steam locomotive&lt;/a&gt; that was formed when 75 former &lt;a href=\"Hunslet%20Austerity%200-6-0ST\"&gt;\"Austerity\" 0-6-0ST&lt;/a&gt;s were purchased by the LNER in 1946 from the &lt;a href=\"War%20Department%20%28UK%29\"&gt;War Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe LNER had had trials with one in November 1945 and bought 75 of them in 1946, numbering them 8006-80. All entered &lt;a href=\"British%20Railways\"&gt;British Railways&lt;/a&gt; (BR) service in 1948. BR added 60000 to their numbers so they became 68006-80, and classified them 4F.\nThey were used for shunting in docks, and other similar work where their short wheelbase meant they could negotiate sharp curves. They were used on the &lt;a href=\"Cromford%20and%20High%20Peak%20Railway\"&gt;Cromford and High Peak Railway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, where they displaced the ex-&lt;a href=\"North%20London%20Railway\"&gt;North London Railway&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NLR%20Class%2075\"&gt;Class 75&lt;/a&gt; class 2F s.\nThey were withdrawn between 1960 and 1967. A few were sold into industrial use with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Coal%20Board\"&gt;National Coal Board&lt;/a&gt; (who had several other Austerities) and others.\nPreservation.\nTwo, BR Nos 68077 and 68078 and have been preserved. In addition a large number of Austerities that were used in industry and have survived to preservation. Several of these have been disguised as BR locomotives.\nModels.\nThe erstwhile Rosebud &lt;a href=\"Kitmaster\"&gt;Kitmaster&lt;/a&gt; company produced an unpowered polystyrene injection moulded model kit for &lt;a href=\"00%20gauge\"&gt;00 gauge&lt;/a&gt;, which went on sale in Spring 1961. In early 1963, the Kitmaster brand was sold by its parent company (Rosebud Dolls) to &lt;a href=\"Airfix\"&gt;Airfix&lt;/a&gt;, who transferred the moulding tools to their own factory; they re-introduced some of the former Kitmaster range, including this locomotive. The tool (for this model) was destroyed in a fire at the premises of Dapol Model Railways Ltd in &lt;a href=\"Winsford\"&gt;Winsford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheshire\"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt; so that &lt;a href=\"Dapol\"&gt;Dapol&lt;/a&gt; were unable to produce further kits after their first two production runs totalling 4000 kits after acquisition of the former Airfix moulds."
