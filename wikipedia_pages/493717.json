    "text": "The War of the Roses, (also known in its last years as the County of Origin Series) was the inter-county &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; matches between representative teams from &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, the areas where rugby league has traditionally been most popular in England. The series started in 1895 and was last played in 2003.\nHistory.\nThe first War of the Roses was contested in 1895 as part of the &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;County Championship&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the clubs in rugby league came from Yorkshire and Lancashire and the fixtures was held almost annually, with exceptions for the two world wars (1914\u20131918 and 1939\u20131945) and 1977\u20131978, until 1983 when the County Championship was abandoned. Fixtures between Lancashire and Yorkshire briefly returned firstly between 1985 and 1991 and then again between 2001 and 2003. Eligibility to play was established either by county of birth or in which county players had originally played the sport professionally.\nIn 1985, an annual fixture between Lancashire and Yorkshire was proposed as a replacement for the County Championship. The fixture became known as the Rodstock War of the Roses and the first game was played in September 1985. The series lasted until 1991, when it was scrapped due to lack of interest.\nThe fixture was revived in 2001 under the name of the County of Origin series, inspired by the success of Australia's &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Maroons\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. After three years, the Origin series games were discontinued due to falling attendances.\nRoses matches have continued at amateur level as part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Amateur%20Rugby%20League%20Association\"&gt;BARLA&lt;/a&gt; Three Counties Championship but despite several calls for a return at professional level the fixture remains unplayed.\nResults.\nThe two teams have met in 91 competitive matches with each team having won 44 and three games ending in draws. In addition there have been a number of exhibition matches during the First and Second World Wars when the County Championship was suspended.\nInternational touring teams.\nBoth Lancashire and Yorkshire have played numerous matches against touring &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; teams. From the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20Kangaroo%20tour%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20France\"&gt;1967\u201368&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kangaroo%20Tour\"&gt;Kangaroo Tour&lt;/a&gt;, both Lancashire and Yorkshire were taken off the Australian's itinerary with the only county side they played being &lt;a href=\"Cumbria%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;. The two teams also played in the only Rugby League County Championship in 1974\u201375.\nLancashire.\nAlso see \",\" \".\"\nYorkshire.\nAlso see \",\" \".\"\nWomen's Rugby League.\nIn 2015, the RFL announced that they would stage the inaugural Women's \"War of the Roses\", between Lancashire Ladies and Yorkshire Ladies. The match, which took place at Thatto Heath Crusaders, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%2C%20Merseyside\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;, saw the sides share the honours after a 22\u201322 draw, with an attendance of around 500.\nThe match, held on 18 October 2015, followed a Lancashire Girls vs Yorkshire Girls under 18s match, which finished 34\u20130 in favour of the Yorkshire side.\nOrigin Legends.\nIn 2017, Rugby AM announced a charity game between Yorkshire and Lancashire legends at Headingley Stadium in &lt;a href=\"Leeds%2C%20West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, which saw Yorkshire defeat Lancashire 14\u201312.\nThe following year Yorkshire retained their Origin Legends title with a 32\u201314 victory over Lancashire in Castleford. 28 August 2019 saw the return of the game at Headingley and notable players including Gary Connolly, Denis Betts and Sean Long for Lancashire and Jason Robinson, Stuart Fielden and Rob Burrow for Yorkshire. The game was won 21\u201318 by Lancashire"
