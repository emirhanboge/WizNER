    "text": "The City of Aurora (, ) is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20in%20Colorado%23Home%20rule%20municipality\"&gt;home rule municipality&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Arapahoe%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Arapahoe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adams%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Adams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20counties%20in%20Colorado\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The city's population was 386,261 at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 United States Census&lt;/a&gt; with 336,035 residing in Arapahoe County, 47,720 residing in Adams County, and 2,506 residing in Douglas County. Aurora is the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20municipalities\"&gt;third most populous city&lt;/a&gt; in the State of Colorado and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population\"&gt;51st most populous city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Aurora is a principal city of the &lt;a href=\"Denver%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Denver\u2013Aurora\u2013Lakewood Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; (MSA) and a major city of the &lt;a href=\"Front%20Range%20Urban%20Corridor\"&gt;Front Range Urban Corridor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBefore European settlement, the land that now makes up Aurora was the territory of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, N\u00fau-agha-t\u0289v\u0289-p\u0289\u0331 (Ute), and O\u010deti \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b (Sioux) tribes.\nAurora originated in the 1880s as the town of Fletcher, taking its name from Denver businessman &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Fletcher\"&gt;Donald Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; who saw it as a real estate opportunity. He and his partners staked out east of &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, but the town - and Colorado - struggled mightily after the &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Depression%20of%201893\"&gt;Silver Crash of 1893&lt;/a&gt;. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town Aurora in 1907, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aurora, composed of hundreds of subdivisions, thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.\nAurora's growing population in recent decades has led to efforts for co-equal recognition with its larger neighbor. Former mayor Dennis Champine once expressed the somewhat whimsical notion that eventually the area would be called the \"Aurora/Denver Metropolitan Area\". Indeed, since the 2000 Census Aurora has surpassed Denver in land area, and much of Aurora is undeveloped, while Denver is more fully built-out. However, such efforts are somewhat hampered by the lack of a large, historically important &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Aurora is largely suburban in character, as evidenced by the city's modest number of multi-story buildings.\nA large military presence has existed in Aurora since the early 20th century. In 1918, Army General Hospital #21 (later renamed &lt;a href=\"Fitzsimons%20Army%20Hospital\"&gt;Fitzsimons Army Hospital&lt;/a&gt;) opened, with the U.S. government expanding and upgrading the hospital facilities in 1941 just in time to care for the wounded servicemen of World War II. &lt;a href=\"Lowry%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Lowry Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1938, straddling the border of Aurora and Denver. It eventually closed in 1994, and has been redeveloped into a master-planned community featuring residential, commercial, business and educational facilities. In 1942, the Army Air Corps built Buckley Field, which has been renamed Naval Air Station, Buckley Air National Guard Base, Buckley Air Force Base, and finally &lt;a href=\"Buckley%20Space%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Buckley Space Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. The base, home of the &lt;a href=\"Buckley%20Garrison\"&gt;Buckley Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"140th%20Wing\"&gt;140th Wing&lt;/a&gt; Colorado Air National Guard, is Aurora's largest employer.\nPresident &lt;a href=\"Warren%20G.%20Harding\"&gt;Warren G. Harding&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Fitzsimons%20Army%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Fitzsimons Army Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in 1923, and President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; visited in 1936. In 1943 the hospital was the birthplace of 2004 Democratic presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;. President &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; recovered from a heart attack at Fitzsimons for seven weeks during the fall of 1955. Decommissioned in 1999, the facility is part of the &lt;a href=\"Anschutz%20Medical%20Campus\"&gt;Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colorado%20Denver\"&gt;University of Colorado Denver&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fitzsimons%20Life%20Science%20District\"&gt;Fitzsimons Life Science District&lt;/a&gt;. The Anschutz Medical Campus also includes the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colorado%20Hospital\"&gt;University of Colorado Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, which moved to Aurora from Denver in 2007, and the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Hospital%20%28Aurora%2C%20Colorado%29\"&gt;Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The first carbon-ion &lt;a href=\"Particle%20therapy\"&gt;radiotherapy research&lt;/a&gt; and treatment facility in the U.S. has been proposed at the site. These facilities will employ a workforce of 32,000 at build-out.\nIn 1965, mayor &lt;a href=\"Norma%20O.%20Walker\"&gt;Norma O. Walker&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20first%20female%20mayors\"&gt;first woman&lt;/a&gt; to head a U.S. city with a population over 60,000.\nIn 1978, the cult coming-of-age film \"&lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Edge%20%28film%29\"&gt;Over the Edge&lt;/a&gt;\" was filmed in Aurora; the crime drama has been named the \u201csignature film\u201d of Denver.\nIn 1979, it was announced that a science fiction theme park would be built in Aurora using the sets of a $50 million film based on the fantasy novel &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Light\"&gt;Lord of Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to legal problems the project was never completed. The script of the unmade film project, renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Argo%20%282012%20film%29\"&gt;Argo&lt;/a&gt;\", was used as cover for the \"Canadian Caper\": the exfiltration of six U.S. diplomatic staff trapped by the &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20hostage%20crisis\"&gt;Iranian hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993, &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Creek%20State%20Park\"&gt;Cherry Creek State Park&lt;/a&gt; on the southwestern edge of Aurora was the location for the papal mass of the 8th &lt;a href=\"World%20Youth%20Day\"&gt;World Youth Day&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, attended by an estimated 500,000 people.\nAurora is split among three counties and lies distant from the respective county seats. A &lt;a href=\"consolidated%20city-county\"&gt;consolidated city and county government&lt;/a&gt; such as those found elsewhere in Colorado (&lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broomfield%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Broomfield&lt;/a&gt;) was considered in the mid-1990s but failed to win approval by city voters; the issue was reconsidered in 2006.\nAurora Sports Park opened in 2003. In 2004, Aurora was honored as the \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's 50th Anniversary \"Sportstown\" for Colorado because of its exemplary involvement in facilitating and enhancing sports. The city attracts more than 30 regional and national sports tournaments annually to Aurora's fields, which include the Aurora's active populace is also reflected in the variety of professional athletes &lt;a href=\"%23Notables\"&gt;hailing from the city&lt;/a&gt;. Aurora's first semi-professional sports franchise, the &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Cavalry\"&gt;Aurora Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Basketball%20League%20%282005-%29\"&gt;International Basketball League&lt;/a&gt;, began play in 2006 but folded by season's end due to budget mishaps.\nIn 2008, Aurora was designated an &lt;a href=\"All-America%20City\"&gt;All-America City&lt;/a&gt; by the National Civic League.\nIn 2017, the &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador\"&gt;Republic of El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; opened a consulate in Aurora, serving Colorado, &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nebraska\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wyoming\"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.\nAurora theater shooting.\nOn July 20, 2012, Aurora was the site of the third largest &lt;a href=\"mass%20shooting\"&gt;mass shooting&lt;/a&gt; in terms of number of casualties in United States history at the time and the second-deadliest shooting in Colorado after the 1999 &lt;a href=\"Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre\"&gt;Columbine High School massacre&lt;/a&gt;. The shooting occurred just after midnight, when &lt;a href=\"James%20Holmes%20%28mass%20murderer%29\"&gt;James Holmes&lt;/a&gt; opened fire during the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20movie%23Midnight%20releases\"&gt;midnight premiere&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Knight%20Rises\"&gt;The Dark Knight Rises&lt;/a&gt;\" in a &lt;a href=\"Century%20Theatres\"&gt;Century&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"movie%20theater\"&gt;movie theater&lt;/a&gt;, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Holmes was arrested and was eventually sentenced to 12 life sentences in prison with an additional required 3,318 years. The shooting drew an international response from world leaders. U.S. President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; visited victims, as well as local and state officials, and addressed the nation in a televised address from Aurora on July 22. Actor &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Bale\"&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt;, who plays &lt;a href=\"Batman\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; in the film, also visited some victims in hospitals. The events marked a turning point in recognition and public perception of the city; rather than referring to the site as being in \"Denver\" or \"suburban Denver\", as would have been typical before the event, virtually all media accounts of the incident unequivocally named \"Aurora\" as its location.\nElijah McClain.\nOn August 30, 2019, Aurora &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; massage therapist &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20Elijah%20McClain\"&gt;Elijah McClain&lt;/a&gt; died six days after an incident with three Aurora police officers. On June 27, 2020, Aurora Police in riot gear dispersed thousands of protestors in the &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20Elijah%20McClain%23Violin%20Protest\"&gt;Violin Protest of the death of Elijah McClain&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAurora's official elevation, posted on signs at the city limits, is .

The lowest elevation of is found at the point where &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Creek%20%28Denver%2C%20Colorado%29\"&gt;Sand Creek&lt;/a&gt; crosses the city limit in the northwest corner of the city, while the highest elevation of is on the extreme southern border of the city in Douglas County, near the intersection of Inspiration and Gartrell roads.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, the city had a total area of including of water. The city is about 5 percent more extensive than neighboring &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; and ranks as the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20area\"&gt;56th largest U.S. city in land area&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeighborhoods.\nAurora is composed of dozens of neighborhoods, districts and (current and former) military installations. Among them:\nClimate.\nAurora experiences a &lt;a href=\"semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Cold%20l%20steppe\"&gt;\"BSk\"&lt;/a&gt;\"), with four distinct seasons and modest precipitation year-round.

The Regional Transportation District's &lt;a href=\"light%20rail\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; transit system was extended to serve the southwestern edge of Aurora on November 17, 2006. The &lt;a href=\"H%20Line%20%28RTD%29\"&gt;H Line&lt;/a&gt; stops at Aurora's &lt;a href=\"Dayton%20%28RTD%29\"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Mile%20%28RTD%29\"&gt;Nine Mile&lt;/a&gt; Stations; a comprehensive network of feeder buses in southern Aurora serve the latter. On February 24, 2017, the line was extended as the &lt;a href=\"R%20Line%20%28RTD%29\"&gt;R Line&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Peoria%20station\"&gt;Peoria Station&lt;/a&gt; in the city's northwest, where riders may transfer to the &lt;a href=\"A%20Line%20%28RTD%29\"&gt;A Line&lt;/a&gt; providing service between Union Station in downtown Denver and &lt;a href=\"Denver%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Denver International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (DIA). Much of Aurora is more convenient to DIA than Denver itself, and the city is planning an &lt;a href=\"aerotropolis\"&gt;aerotropolis&lt;/a&gt; along the airport's southern flank. This proximity is a factor in the expected growth of the E-470 corridor directly south of DIA, projected to eventually accommodate 250,000 additional Aurora residents. The easternmost portions of Aurora adjoin the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Air%20and%20Space%20Port\"&gt;Colorado Air and Space Port&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2017, Aurora became the first city in Colorado to host a dockless &lt;a href=\"Bicycle-sharing%20system\"&gt;bike sharing program&lt;/a&gt;.\nSports.\nIn 2014 the &lt;a href=\"U.S.A.%20Powerlifting\"&gt;U.S.A.

The WC was the 35th Women and 44th Men open Powerlifting Championships, and it was held on the &lt;a href=\"Radisson%20Hotel%20Denver%20Southeast\"&gt;Radisson Hotel Denver Southeast&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable people.\nSome notable individuals who were born in or have lived in Aurora include:\nSister cities.\nAurora's &lt;a href=\"sister%20cities\"&gt;sister cities&lt;/a&gt; are:\nFriendship cities.\nAurora also has one friendship city:"
