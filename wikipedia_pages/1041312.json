    "text": "Phytoplasmas are &lt;a href=\"obligate%20intracellular%20parasite\"&gt;obligate intracellular parasite&lt;/a&gt;s of plant &lt;a href=\"phloem\"&gt;phloem&lt;/a&gt; tissue and of the &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;vectors&lt;/a&gt; that are involved in their plant-to-plant transmission. Phytoplasmas were discovered in 1967 by Japanese scientists who termed them &lt;a href=\"mycoplasma\"&gt;mycoplasma&lt;/a&gt;-like organisms. Since their discovery, phytoplasmas have resisted all attempts at \"in vitro\" culture in any cell-free medium; routine cultivation in an artificial medium thus remains a major challenge. Phytoplasmas are characterized by the lack of a &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pleomorphism%20%28microbiology%29\"&gt;pleiomorphic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Filamentation\"&gt;filamentous&lt;/a&gt; shape, a &lt;a href=\"diameter\"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt; normally less than 1 &lt;a href=\"micrometre\"&gt;\u03bcm&lt;/a&gt;, and a very small &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhytoplasmas are &lt;a href=\"pathogen\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;s of agriculturally important plants, including &lt;a href=\"coconut\"&gt;coconut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sandalwood\"&gt;sandalwood&lt;/a&gt;, in which they cause a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild yellowing to death. Phytoplasmas are most prevalent in &lt;a href=\"Tropics\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Subtropics\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; regions. They are transmitted from plant to plant by vectors (normally sap-sucking insects such as &lt;a href=\"leafhopper\"&gt;leafhopper&lt;/a&gt;s) in which they both survive and &lt;a href=\"Asexual%20reproduction\"&gt;replicate&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nReferences to diseases now known to be caused by phytoplasmas can be found as far back as 1603 (&lt;a href=\"Morus%20%28plant%29\"&gt;mulberry&lt;/a&gt; dwarf disease in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;). Such diseases were originally thought to be caused by &lt;a href=\"plant%20virus\"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, which, like phytoplasmas, require insect vectors, and cannot be cultured. Viral and phytoplasmic infections share some symptoms. In 1967, phytoplasmas were discovered in ultrathin sections of plant phloem tissue and were termed mycoplasma-like organisms due to their physiological resemblance. The organisms were renamed phytoplasmas in 1994, at the 10th Congress of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Mycoplasmology\"&gt;International Organization for Mycoplasmology&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorphology.\nPhytoplasmas are &lt;a href=\"Mollicutes\"&gt;Mollicutes&lt;/a&gt;, which are bound by a triple-layered &lt;a href=\"membrane\"&gt;membrane&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a cell wall. The phytoplasma cell membranes studied to date usually contain a single immunodominant &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; of unknown function that constitutes most of the protein in the membrane. A typical phytoplasma is pleiomorphic or filamentous in shape and is less than 1 \u03bcm in diameter. Like other &lt;a href=\"prokaryote\"&gt;prokaryote&lt;/a&gt;s, phytoplasmic DNA is distributed throughout the &lt;a href=\"cytoplasm\"&gt;cytoplasm&lt;/a&gt;, instead of being concentrated in a nucleus.\nSymptoms.\nPhytoplasmas can infect and cause various symptoms in more than 700 plant species. One characteristic &lt;a href=\"symptom\"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; is abnormal floral organ development including &lt;a href=\"phyllody\"&gt;phyllody&lt;/a&gt;, (i.e., the production of &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaf&lt;/a&gt;-like structures in place of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"virescence\"&gt;virescence&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the development of green flowers attributable to a loss of pigment by &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt; cells). Phytoplasma-harboring flowering plants may nevertheless be &lt;a href=\"sterility%20%28physiology%29\"&gt;sterile&lt;/a&gt;. The expression of genes involved in maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Meristem%23Apical%20meristems\"&gt;apical meristem&lt;/a&gt; or in the development of floral organs is altered in the morphologically affected floral organs of phytoplasma-infected plants.\nA phytoplasma infection often triggers leaf yellowing, probably due to the presence of phytoplasma cells in phloem, which can affect phloem function and &lt;a href=\"carbohydrate\"&gt;carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; transport, inhibit &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt; biosynthesis, and trigger chlorophyll breakdown. These symptoms may be attributable to stress caused by the infection rather than a specific pathogenetic process.\nMany phytoplasma-infected plants develop a &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;bushy&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"witches%27%20broom\"&gt;witches' broom&lt;/a&gt;\" appearance due to changes in their normal growth patterns. Most plants exhibit &lt;a href=\"apical%20dominance\"&gt;apical dominance&lt;/a&gt; but infection can trigger the proliferation of axillary (side) shoots and a reduction in internode size. Such symptoms are actually useful in the commercial production of &lt;a href=\"poinsettia\"&gt;poinsettia&lt;/a&gt;s. Infection triggers more axillary shoot production; the poinsettia plants thus produce more than a single flower.\nEffector (virulence) proteins.\nMany plant pathogens produce &lt;a href=\"virulence%20factor\"&gt;virulence factor&lt;/a&gt;s (i.e., effectors) that modulate or interfere with normal host processes to the benefit of the pathogens. In 2009, a secreted protein, termed \u201ctengu-su inducer\u201d (TENGU; ), was identified from a phytoplasma causing yellowing of &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;s; this was the first phytoplasmal virulence factor to be described. TENGU induces characteristic symptoms (termed \u201ctengu-su\u201d), including witches' broom and dwarfism. Transgenic expression of TENGU in \"&lt;a href=\"Arabidopsis\"&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/a&gt;\" plants induced sterility in male and female flowers. TENGU contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus; after cleavage, the mature protein is only 38 amino acids in length. Although phytoplasmas are restricted to phloem, TENGU is transported from phloem to other cells, including those of the apical and axillary meristems. TENGU was suggested to inhibit both auxin- and jasmonic acid-related pathways, thereby affecting plant development. Surprisingly, the N-terminal 11 amino acid region of the mature protein triggers symptom development in \"&lt;a href=\"Nicotiana%20benthamiana\"&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/a&gt;\" plants. TENGU undergoes proteolytic processing by a plant serine protease \"in vivo\", suggesting that the N-terminal peptide (i.e., the 11 amino acid fragment) alone induces the observed symptoms. TENGU homologs have been identified in AY-group phytoplasmas. All such homologs undergo processing and can induce symptoms, suggesting that the symptom-inducing mechanism is conserved among TENGU homologs.\nIn 2009, 56 genes for secreted proteins were identified in the genome of &lt;a href=\"Aster%20yellows\"&gt;aster yellows witches' broom&lt;/a&gt; phytoplasma strain (AY-WB); these were named secreted AY-WB proteins (SAPs) and considered effectors. Also in 2009, effector SAP11 was shown to target plant cell nuclei and unload from phloem cells in AY-WB-infected plants. SAP11 was found to induce stem proliferations and changes of leaf shapes of plants; the stem proliferations induced by SAP11 resemble witches' broom symptoms of AY-WB-infected plants. In addition, it was demonstrated that SAP11 interacts with and destabilizes plant class II &lt;a href=\"TCP%20protein%20domain\"&gt;TCP protein domain&lt;/a&gt; transcription factors that leads to shoot proliferations and leaf shape changes. In addition to regulation of plant development, TCPs also control the expression of lipoxygenase genes required for &lt;a href=\"jasmonate\"&gt;jasmonate&lt;/a&gt; biosynthesis. Jasmonate levels are decreased in phytoplasma-infected \"Arabidopsis\" plants and plants that transgenically express the AY-WB SAP11 effector. The downregulation of jasmonate production is beneficial to phytoplasmas because jasmonate is involved in plant defenses against herbivorous insects such as &lt;a href=\"leafhopper\"&gt;leafhopper&lt;/a&gt;s. Leafhoppers lay increased numbers of eggs on AY-WB-infected plants, at least in part because of SAP11 production. For example, the leafhopper \"&lt;a href=\"Macrosteles%20quadrilineatus\"&gt;Macrosteles quadrilineatus&lt;/a&gt;\" laid 30% more eggs on plants that expressing SAP11 transgenically than control plants, and 60% more eggs on plants infected with AY-WB. Phytoplasmas cannot survive in the external environment and are dependent upon insects such as leafhoppers for transmission to new (healthy) plants. Thus, by compromising jasmonate production, SAP11 'encourages' leafhoppers to lay more eggs on phytoplasma-infected plants, thereby ensuring that newly hatched leafhopper nymphs feed upon infected plants to become phytoplasma vectors. SAP11 effectors are identified in a number of divergent phytoplasmas and these effectors also interact with TCPs and modulate plant defenses. SAP11 is the first phytoplasma virulence protein for which plant targets and effector functions (i.e. evidence of benefit for the pathogen) were identified. TCPs were found to be targeted by a number of other pathogen effectors.\nThe AY-WB phytoplasma effector SAP54 was shown to induce virescence and phyllody when expressed in plants and homologs of this effector were found in at least three other phytoplasmas. Two SAP54 homologs, PHYL1 of the onion yellows phytoplasma and PHYL1PnWB of the peanut witches' broom phytoplasma, also induce phyllody-like floral abnormalities. These results suggest that PHYL1, SAP54, and their homologs form a phyllody-inducing gene family, the members of which are termed phyllogens. &lt;a href=\"MADS-box\"&gt;MADS-box&lt;/a&gt; transcription factors (MTFs) of the ABCE model play critical roles in floral organ development in \"Arabidopsis\". Phyllogens interact directly with class A and class E MTFs, inducing protein degradation in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner that, at least for SAP54, is dependent on interactions with the proteasome shuttle factor RAD23. Interestingly, RAD23 mutants do not show phyllody when infected with phytoplasma indicating that RAD23 proteins are susceptibility factors; i.e. phytoplasmas and SAP54 require these plant proteins to induce phyllody symptoms. The accumulation of mRNAs encoding class B MTFs, the transcription of which is positively regulated by class A and class E MTFs, is drastically decreased in Arabidopsis constitutively expressing PHYL1. Phyllogens induce abnormal floral organ development by inhibiting the functions of these MTFs. RAD23 proteins are also required for promoting leafhopper vector egg laying on plants that express SAP54 and are infected with AY-WB phytoplasma.\nTransmission.\nMovement between plants.\nPhytoplasmas are spread principally by &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;families&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leafhopper\"&gt;Cicadellidae&lt;/a&gt; (leafhoppers), &lt;a href=\"Fulgoridae\"&gt;Fulgoridae&lt;/a&gt; (planthoppers), and &lt;a href=\"Jumping%20plant%20louse\"&gt;Psyllidae&lt;/a&gt; (jumping plant lice), \nwhich feed on the phloem of infected plants, ingesting phytoplasmas and transmitting them to the next plant on which they feed. Thus, the host range of phytoplasmas is strongly dependent upon that of the insect vector. Phytoplasmas contain a major antigenic protein constituting most of the cell surface protein. This protein associates with insect microfilament complexes and is believed to control insect-phytoplasma interactions. Phytoplasmas can overwinter in insect vectors or perennial plants. Phytoplasmas can have varying effects on their insect hosts; examples of both reduced and increased fitness have been noted.\nPhytoplasmas enter the insect body through the &lt;a href=\"stylet%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;stylet&lt;/a&gt;, pass through the &lt;a href=\"Gastrointestinal%20tract%23Lower%20gastrointestinal%20tract\"&gt;intestine&lt;/a&gt;, and then move to the &lt;a href=\"hemolymph\"&gt;hemolymph&lt;/a&gt; and colonize the &lt;a href=\"salivary%20gland\"&gt;salivary gland&lt;/a&gt;s: the entire process can take up to 3 weeks. Once established in an insect host, phytoplasmas are found in most major organs. The time between ingestion by the insect and attainment of an infectious titer in the salivary glands is termed the latency period.\nPhytoplasmas can also be spread via dodders (\"&lt;a href=\"Cuscuta\"&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/a&gt;\") or by vegetative propagation such as the &lt;a href=\"grafting\"&gt;grafting&lt;/a&gt; of infected plant tissue onto a healthy plant.\nMovement within plants.\nPhytoplasmas move within phloem from &lt;a href=\"Phloem%23Function\"&gt;a source to a sink&lt;/a&gt;, and can pass through &lt;a href=\"sieve%20tube%20element\"&gt;sieve tube element&lt;/a&gt;. However, as phytoplasmas spread more slowly than &lt;a href=\"solute\"&gt;solute&lt;/a&gt;s, and for other reasons, passive translocation within plants is thought to be unimportant\nDetection and diagnosis.\nBefore the molecular era, the diagnosis of phytoplasma-caused diseases was difficult because the organisms could not be cultured. Thus, classical diagnostic techniques, including symptom observation were used. Ultrathin sections of phloem tissue from plants with suspected phytoplasma-infections were also studied. The empirical use of &lt;a href=\"antibiotics\"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"tetracycline\"&gt;tetracycline&lt;/a&gt; was additionally employed.\nMolecular diagnostic techniques for phytoplasma detection began to emerge in the 1980s and included enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (&lt;a href=\"ELISA\"&gt;ELISA&lt;/a&gt;)-based methods. In the early 1990s, &lt;a href=\"polymerase%20chain%20reaction\"&gt;polymerase chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; (PCR)-based techniques were developed: these are far more sensitive than ELISAs, and &lt;a href=\"restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism\"&gt;restriction fragment length polymorphism&lt;/a&gt; (RFLP) analysis allowed the accurate identification of various phytoplasma &lt;a href=\"Strain%20%28biology%29\"&gt;strains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore recent techniques allow infection levels to be assessed. Both &lt;a href=\"Real-time%20polymerase%20chain%20reaction\"&gt;quantitative PCR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bioimaging\"&gt;bioimaging&lt;/a&gt; can effectively quantify phytoplasma &lt;a href=\"titer\"&gt;titer&lt;/a&gt;s within plant. In addition, &lt;a href=\"loop-mediated%20isothermal%20amplification\"&gt;loop-mediated isothermal amplification&lt;/a&gt; (a sensitive, simple, and rapid diagnostic method) is now available as a commercial kit allowing all known phytoplasma species to be detected in about 1 h, including the DNA extraction step.\nAlthough phytoplasmas have recently been reported to be grown in a specific artificial medium, experimental &lt;a href=\"Reproducibility\"&gt;repetition&lt;/a&gt; has yet to be reported.\nControl.\nPhytoplasmas are normally controlled by the breeding and planting of disease-resistant crop varieties (perhaps the most economically viable option) and by the control of insect vectors.\n&lt;a href=\"Tissue%20culture\"&gt;Tissue culture&lt;/a&gt; can be used to produce healthy clones of phytoplasma-infected plants. Cryotherapy (i.e., the freezing of plant samples in &lt;a href=\"liquid%20nitrogen\"&gt;liquid nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;) prior to tissue culture increases the probability of producing healthy plants in this manner.\n&lt;a href=\"Plantibody\"&gt;Plantibodies&lt;/a&gt; targeting phytoplasmas have also been developed.\n&lt;a href=\"Tetracycline\"&gt;Tetracycline&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"Bacteriostatic%20agent\"&gt;bacteriostatic&lt;/a&gt; to phytoplasmas. However, disease symptoms reappear in the absence of continuous antibiotic application. Thus, tetracycline is not a viable agricultural control agent, but it is used to protect ornamental coconut trees.\nGenetics.\nThe genomes of four phytoplasmas have been &lt;a href=\"DNA%20sequencing\"&gt;sequenced&lt;/a&gt;: \"onion yellows\", \"&lt;a href=\"aster%20yellows\"&gt;aster yellows&lt;/a&gt; witches' broom\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Candidatus\"&gt;Candidatus&lt;/a&gt;\" Phytoplasma asteris), \"Ca.\"\u00a0Phytoplasma australiense, and \"Ca.\"\u00a0Phytoplasma mali. Phytoplasmas have very small genomes, with extremely low &lt;a href=\"GC%20content\"&gt;GC content&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes as little as 23%, which is thought to be the lower threshold for a viable genome). In fact, the Bermuda grass white-leaf phytoplasma (&lt;a href=\"Candidatus%20Phytoplasma%20cynodontis\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) has a genome size of only 530 kb, one of the smallest known genomes of all living organisms. The larger phytoplasma genomes are around 1350 kb in size. The small genome size of phytoplasma is attributable to reductive evolution from \"&lt;a href=\"Bacillus\"&gt;Bacillus&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"&lt;a href=\"Clostridium\"&gt;Clostridium&lt;/a&gt;\" ancestors. Phytoplasmas have lost \u226575% of their original genes, and can thus no longer survive outside of insects or plant phloem. Some phytoplasmas contain &lt;a href=\"extrachromosomal%20DNA\"&gt;extrachromosomal DNA&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"plasmid\"&gt;plasmid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite their small genomes, many predicted phytoplasma genes are present in multiple copies. Phytoplasmas lack many genes encoding standard &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolic&lt;/a&gt; functions and have no functioning &lt;a href=\"homologous%20recombination\"&gt;homologous recombination&lt;/a&gt; pathway, but they do have a \"&lt;a href=\"Secretion\"&gt;sec&lt;/a&gt;\" transport pathway. Many phytoplasmas contain two &lt;a href=\"rRNA%20operon\"&gt;rRNA operon&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"Mollicutes\"&gt;Mollicutes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Genetic%20code\"&gt;triplet code&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stop%20codon\"&gt;UGA&lt;/a&gt; is used as a &lt;a href=\"stop%20codon\"&gt;stop codon&lt;/a&gt; in phytoplasmas.\nPhytoplasma genomes contain large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Transposable%20element\"&gt;transposons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"insertion%20sequence\"&gt;insertion sequence&lt;/a&gt;s and also contain a unique family of &lt;a href=\"repetitive%20extragenic%20palindrome\"&gt;repetitive extragenic palindrome&lt;/a&gt;s termed PhREPS for which no role is known. However, it is theorized that the &lt;a href=\"stem-loop\"&gt;stem-loop&lt;/a&gt; structures in PhREPS play a role in &lt;a href=\"Terminator%20%28genetics%29\"&gt;transcription termination&lt;/a&gt; or genome stability.\nTaxonomy.\nPhytoplasmas belong to the &lt;a href=\"monotypic%20taxon\"&gt;monotypic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Order%20%28biology%29\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Acholeplasmatales\"&gt;Acholeplasmatales&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992, the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Mollicutes proposed the use of 'Phytoplasma' rather than 'mycoplasma-like organisms' 'for reference to the phytopathogenic mollicutes'. In 2004, the generic name Phytoplasma was adopted and is currently of &lt;a href=\"Candidatus\"&gt;Candidatus&lt;/a&gt; (Ca.) status (used for &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that cannot be cultured). Phytoplasma &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; is complicated because the organisms cannot be cultured; methods normally used to classify &lt;a href=\"prokaryote\"&gt;prokaryote&lt;/a&gt;s are thus not available. Phytoplasma taxonomic groups are based on differences in fragment sizes produced by &lt;a href=\"restriction%20digest\"&gt;restriction digest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"16S%20ribosomal%20RNA\"&gt;16S ribosomal RNA&lt;/a&gt; gene sequences (&lt;a href=\"restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism\"&gt;RFLPs&lt;/a&gt;) or by comparisons of DNA sequences from 16s/23s spacer regions. The actual number of taxonomic groups remains unclear; recent work on computer-simulated restriction digests of the 16Sr gene suggested up to 28 groups, whereas others have proposed fewer groups with more subgroups. Each group includes at least one \"Ca.\" Phytoplasma species, characterized by distinctive biological, phytopathological, and genetic properties.\nSpecies.\n, the following names and type strains are from LPSN, the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature. The associated diseases and 16Sr group-subgroup classifications are from various sources."
