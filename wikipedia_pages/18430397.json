    "text": "Tlatelolco (, or \"\", from \"tlalli\" - land; \"telolli\" - hill; \"co\" - place; ) is an area now within the &lt;a href=\"Cuauht%C3%A9moc%2C%20D.F.\"&gt;Cuauht\u00e9moc&lt;/a&gt; borough of &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, centered on the &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20de%20las%20Tres%20Culturas\"&gt;Plaza de las Tres Culturas&lt;/a&gt; (Square of Three Cultures). Its archeological history extends to remains from the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as more recent &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Colonial%20architecture\"&gt;colonial structures&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe square is bounded by an excavated &lt;a href=\"Aztec\"&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tlatelolco%20%28archaeological%20site%29\"&gt;archaeological site&lt;/a&gt;, the 16th century college church designed by &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Juan%20de%20Torquemada\"&gt;Fray Juan de Torquemada&lt;/a&gt; and dedicated to &lt;a href=\"St%20James%20the%20Great\"&gt;St James the Great&lt;/a&gt; (known as &lt;a href=\"Colegio%20de%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tlatelolco\"&gt;Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco&lt;/a&gt;), the remains of a former Franciscan convent to which was formerly attached the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, and an office complex that was used by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Relations&lt;/a&gt; and is now the property of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;National Autonomous University of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory of modern Tlatelolco.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unidad%20Habitacional%20Nonoalco-Tlatelolco\"&gt;Nonoalco-Tlatelolco housing project&lt;/a&gt;, built in the 1960s, is served by &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Tlatelolco\"&gt;Metro Tlatelolco&lt;/a&gt;. The complex includes the &lt;a href=\"Torre%20Insignia\"&gt;pyramid-shaped&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Banobras\"&gt;Banobras&lt;/a&gt; building, which houses a 47-bell &lt;a href=\"carillon\"&gt;carillon&lt;/a&gt;. At 125 meters, this is the world's tallest carillon tower. A building with a facade of white marble was constructed by the government for and used by the &lt;a href=\"Secretariat%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Secretariat of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (SRE). It is now used by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;National Autonomous University of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1967, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tlatelolco\"&gt;Treaty of Tlatelolco&lt;/a&gt; signed here, with the aim of establishing a &lt;a href=\"nuclear-weapon-free%20zone\"&gt;nuclear-weapon-free zone&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, all the region's countries have signed and ratified the treaty.\nThe late 1960s were a time of political unrest in Mexico and many western nations. On October 2, 1968, ten days before the start of the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1968 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, the plaza was the scene of the &lt;a href=\"Tlatelolco%20massacre\"&gt;Tlatelolco massacre&lt;/a&gt;. The exact number of dead and injured in that tragic afternoon is still unknown, but it is estimated that 15 thousand shells were fired and there were more than 300 dead and 700 injured by the Mexican &lt;a href=\"army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; who were trying to suppress the protests, in addition, 5 thousand students were arrested.\nOn September 19, 1985, many homes and business structures were destroyed or suffered damage due to the &lt;a href=\"1985%20Mexico%20City%20earthquake\"&gt;1985 Mexico City earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Nuevo Le\u00f3n\" building collapsed. Because of Mexicans working together to rescue people from the ruins, it became a symbol of their solidarity during the disaster . A small square marks this spot. Among the many who had family there, the opera singer &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt; worked to help to rescue survivors."
