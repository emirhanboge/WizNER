    "text": "Laetamur admodum issued November 1, 1956, is an &lt;a href=\"encyclical\"&gt;encyclical&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XII\"&gt;Pope Pius XII&lt;/a&gt; renewing his request for &lt;a href=\"prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"peace\"&gt;peace&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Polish%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Holy Father&lt;/a&gt; is most pleased to learn that the Catholic World responded with generosity and enthusiasm to his request for public prayers. And so seems that maybe a new dawn of &lt;a href=\"peace\"&gt;peace&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; seems to be breaking at long last for the people of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. He was happy to learn, that Cardinals &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Wyszynski\"&gt;Stefan Wyszynski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Mindszenty\"&gt;Joseph Mindszenty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Esztergom\"&gt;Esztergom&lt;/a&gt;, who had both been expelled from their Sees, have been restored to their positions, and were warmly welcomed by their faithful. He asks all the Catholics of those countries to unite themselves with their shepherds. True peace has not materialized yet. And war continues in the Middle East."
