    "text": "The Black Island () is the seventh volume of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin\"&gt;The Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\", the comics series by Belgian cartoonist &lt;a href=\"Herg%C3%A9\"&gt;Herg\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children's supplement , it was serialised weekly from April to November 1937. The story tells of young Belgian reporter &lt;a href=\"Tintin%20%28character%29\"&gt;Tintin&lt;/a&gt; and his dog &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20%28character%29\"&gt;Snowy&lt;/a&gt;, who travel to &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of a gang of counterfeiters. Framed for theft and hunted by detectives &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20and%20Thompson\"&gt;Thomson and Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, Tintin follows the criminals to &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, discovering their lair on the Black Island.\n\"The Black Island\" was a commercial success and was published in book form by &lt;a href=\"Casterman\"&gt;Casterman&lt;/a&gt; shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Ottokar%27s%20Sceptre\"&gt;King Ottokar's Sceptre&lt;/a&gt;\", while the series itself became a defining part of the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Belgian%20comics\"&gt;Franco-Belgian comics tradition&lt;/a&gt;. In 1943, \"The Black Island\" was coloured and re-drawn in Herg\u00e9's distinctive style for republication. In the mid-1960s, Herg\u00e9's British publishers requested a major revision of the story, for which he sent his assistant &lt;a href=\"Bob%20De%20Moor\"&gt;Bob De Moor&lt;/a&gt; to Britain on a research trip; on his return, &lt;a href=\"Studios%20Herg%C3%A9\"&gt;Studios Herg\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; produced a revised, third edition of the story, serialised in \"&lt;a href=\"Tintin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine. \"The Black Island\" introduces the recurring villain &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Dr. M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;, and has been widely cited as one of the most popular instalments in the series. The story was adapted for the 1957 &lt;a href=\"Belvision\"&gt;Belvision&lt;/a&gt; animation \"&lt;a href=\"Herg%C3%A9%27s%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin\"&gt;Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\", the 1980-1 &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt; play \"Tintin and the Black Island\", the 1991 &lt;a href=\"Ellipse%20Programm%C3%A9\"&gt;Ellipse&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Nelvana\"&gt;Nelvana&lt;/a&gt; animated series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\", and the 1992-3 &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%205%20%28former%29\"&gt;BBC Radio 5&lt;/a&gt; dramatisation of the \"Adventures\".\nSynopsis.\nTintin witnesses a plane land in the Belgian countryside, and is shot by the pilot when he offers his help. While he recovers in hospital, detectives &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20and%20Thompson\"&gt;Thomson and Thompson&lt;/a&gt; visit him and inform him that the plane subsequently flew to &lt;a href=\"Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;, England, where it crashed. Tintin and &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20%28character%29\"&gt;Snowy&lt;/a&gt; proceed to Sussex, but along the way, two criminals frame Tintin for robbery, and he is arrested by Thomson and Thompson; he escapes, but is pursued by the detectives. After arriving in England by ferry in Newhaven, Tintin and Snowy continue their journey in a blue taxi but they are ambushed. With the taxi driver knocked down by one of the criminals, Tintin is kidnapped by the criminals, who attempt to kill him over the cliffs of Seaford, but with Snowy's help he escapes. Discovering the plane wreckage, he finds a torn-up note in the pilot's jacket, and following the writing on it arrives at the estate of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Dr. J. W. M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;, a German who owns a mental institution. M\u00fcller captures Tintin, but the young reporter again escapes. In a scuffle, M\u00fcller's house catches ablaze and the criminals escape.\nFinally, the fire brigade arrived just in time to extinguish the fire of Dr. Muller\u2019s house, but Tintin is still trapped inside the burning house. In the end, one of the firemen finally rescued Tintin out of the burning house.\nThe next morning, just after Tintin recovers in hospital, he finds electric cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising that they are there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that M\u00fcller is part of a gang of forgers. He pursues M\u00fcller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When M\u00fcller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20landing\"&gt;crash land&lt;/a&gt; in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.\nLearning that M\u00fcller's plane had crashed off the coast of Kiltoch, a Scottish coastal village, Tintin travels there to continue his investigation. At Kiltoch, an old man tells him the story of Black Island\u00a0\u2014 an island off the coast where a \"ferocious beast\" kills any visitors. Tintin and Snowy travel to the island, where they find that the \"beast\" is a trained gorilla named Ranko. They further discover that the forgers are using the island as their base, and radio the police for help. Although the forgers attempt to capture Tintin, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Ranko, who was injured during Tintin's attempts to hold off the forgers, becomes docile enough to allow Tintin to bring him to a zoo.\nHistory.\nBackground and research.\nGeorges Remi\u2014best known under the pen name &lt;a href=\"Herg%C3%A9\"&gt;Herg\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was employed as editor and illustrator of (\"\"The Little Twentieth\"), a children's supplement to (\"The Twentieth Century\"\"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, &lt;a href=\"social%20conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; Belgian newspaper based in Herg\u00e9's native Brussels which was run by the \"&lt;a href=\"Abb%C3%A9\"&gt;Abb\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Norbert%20Wallez\"&gt;Norbert Wallez&lt;/a&gt;. In 1929, Herg\u00e9 began \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin\"&gt;The Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\" comic strip for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter &lt;a href=\"Tintin%20%28character%29\"&gt;Tintin&lt;/a&gt;. Wallez ordered Herg\u00e9 to set his first adventure in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"anti-socialism\"&gt;anti-socialist&lt;/a&gt; propaganda for children (\"&lt;a href=\"Tintin%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20the%20Soviets\"&gt;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&lt;/a&gt;\"), to set his second adventure in the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Congo\"&gt;Belgian Congo&lt;/a&gt; to encourage colonial sentiment (\"&lt;a href=\"Tintin%20in%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Tintin in the Congo&lt;/a&gt;\"), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (\"&lt;a href=\"Tintin%20in%20America\"&gt;Tintin in America&lt;/a&gt;\"). Wallez was subsequently removed from the paper's editorship following a scandal, although Herg\u00e9 was convinced to stay on the condition of a salary increase.\nFor his next serial, Herg\u00e9 planned to put together a story that caricatured the actions of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, developing the plot for \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Ottokar%27s%20Sceptre\"&gt;King Ottokar's Sceptre&lt;/a&gt;\". However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Klondike%2C%20Yukon\"&gt;Klondike&lt;/a&gt; as potential locations. The result was \"The Black Island\", although Herg\u00e9 only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a snowdrift on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of &lt;a href=\"anarchism\"&gt;anarchists&lt;/a&gt; bent on destroying Europe's iconic buildings, but again this idea did not make it into the eventual story. Having decided to set most of his story in Britain, Herg\u00e9 briefly visited &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and the southern English coast to learn more about the country. There, he purchased a stainless steel &lt;a href=\"Gillott%27s\"&gt;Gillott's&lt;/a&gt; Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an &lt;a href=\"Anglophilia\"&gt;Anglophilia&lt;/a&gt; that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHerg\u00e9 retained the anti-German sentiment that he had first considered for \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" through the inclusion of a German villain, Dr. M\u00fcller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the Tintin series. He based the character largely on , a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from a February 1934 article of the anti-conformist Belgian magazine \"La Crapouillot\" (\"The Mortar Shell\"). M\u00fcller's counterfeiting operations were inspired by Bell's actions, as he was involved in a plot to destabilise Soviet &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; through counterfeiting Russian roubles. Rather than Germans, M\u00fcller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed &lt;a href=\"Puschov\"&gt;Puschov&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.\nForging banknotes was a topical crime at the time, while the idea of villains using superstition to hide their lair was a common trope, one that Herg\u00e9 had used previously in \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\".\nThe idea of Ranko brought together two popular fictional creatures of the 1930s; the giant ape &lt;a href=\"King%20Kong\"&gt;King Kong&lt;/a&gt;, who had been introduced in the film \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29\"&gt;King Kong&lt;/a&gt;\" (1933), and the &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Ness%20Monster\"&gt;Loch Ness Monster&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cryptid\"&gt;cryptid&lt;/a&gt; who was to have lived in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Ness\"&gt;Loch Ness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Leroux\"&gt;Gaston Leroux&lt;/a&gt;'s character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Hitchcock\"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;'s 1935 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%2039%20Steps%20%281935%20film%29\"&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/a&gt;\", itself an adaptation of &lt;a href=\"John%20Buchan\"&gt;John Buchan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-Nine%20Steps\"&gt;1915 adventure novel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginal publication.\n\"The Black Island\" was first serialised in \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\" from 15 April to 16 November 1937 under the title \"Le Myst\u00e8re De L'Avion Gris\" (\"The Mystery of the Grey Plane\"). From 17 April 1938, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"C%C5%93urs%20Vaillants\"&gt;C\u0153urs Vaillants&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1938, \u00c9ditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume, publishing it under the title \"L'\u00cele noire\" (\"The Black Island\"). Herg\u00e9 however was unhappy with this publication due to errors throughout, most egregiously that the front cover omitted his name.\nThe inclusion of a television in the original version would have surprised many readers. The &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.\nSecond and third versions.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, when Herg\u00e9's popularity had increased, he and his team at &lt;a href=\"Studios%20Herg%C3%A9\"&gt;Studios Herg\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; redrew and coloured many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures. They used the (\"clear line\") drawing style that Herg\u00e9 had developed, in this way ensuring that the earlier stories fitted in visually alongside the new \"Adventures of Tintin\" being created. Casterman published this second, colourised version of the story in 1943, reduced from 124 pages to 60.\nThis second version contained no significant changes from the original 1937 one, although the black-and-white television screen that had appeared in the 1930s version was now depicted as a colour screen, despite the fact that &lt;a href=\"Color%20television%23Development\"&gt;such technology was not yet available&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 1960s, Herg\u00e9's English language publishers, &lt;a href=\"Methuen%20Publishing\"&gt;Methuen&lt;/a&gt;, were planning on translating and publishing \"The Black Island\" for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers would find the depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew up a list of 131 errors that they asked Herg\u00e9 to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared with some of the most recently published \"Adventures\" like \"&lt;a href=\"Destination%20Moon%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Destination Moon&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Calculus%20Affair\"&gt;The Calculus Affair&lt;/a&gt;\", which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Herg\u00e9 was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, \"&lt;a href=\"Flight%20714%20to%20Sydney\"&gt;Flight 714 to Sydney&lt;/a&gt;\", and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant &lt;a href=\"Bob%20De%20Moor\"&gt;Bob De Moor&lt;/a&gt; to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as &lt;a href=\"Batemans\"&gt;Batemans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"White%20Cliffs%20of%20Dover\"&gt;White Cliffs of Dover&lt;/a&gt;, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked &lt;a href=\"British%20Rail\"&gt;British Rail&lt;/a&gt; if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.\nThe new version was serialised in \"&lt;a href=\"Tintin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine from June to December 1965, before Casterman published it in a collected volume in 1966. Studios Herg\u00e9 made many alterations to the illustrations as a result of De Moor's research. Reflecting the fact that television had become increasingly commonplace in Western Europe, Herg\u00e9 changed the prose from \"It's a television set!\" to \"It's only a television set!\" However, as colour television was not yet available in Britain, the screen on the television encountered in Britain was once again reverted to black-and-white. Additionally, at least one line of dialogue was \"softened\" from the original version - in one scene where Tintin aims a pistol at two of the counterfeiters, he states, \"Get back! And put up your hands!\" compared to the original's \"One more step and you're dead!\". The counterfeit notes that Tintin finds were also increased in value, from one &lt;a href=\"Pound%20%28currency%29\"&gt;pound&lt;/a&gt; to five pounds. The multiple aircraft featured throughout the story were redrawn by Studios member &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Leloup\"&gt;Roger Leloup&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced the depiction of planes that were operational in the 1930s to those active at the time, such as a &lt;a href=\"Percival%20Prentice\"&gt;Percival Prentice&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-1%20Chipmunk\"&gt;D.H. Chipmunk&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20150\"&gt;Cessna 150&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth\"&gt;Tiger Moth&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"British%20European%20Airways\"&gt;British European Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hawker%20Siddeley%20Trident\"&gt;Hawker Siddeley Trident&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe clothing worn by characters was brought up-to-date, while the old steam locomotives that were initially featured were replaced by more modern diesel or electrified alternatives. Adverts for the genuine &lt;a href=\"Johnnie%20Walker\"&gt;Johnnie Walker&lt;/a&gt; whisky were replaced by adverts for the fictional &lt;a href=\"in-universe\"&gt;in-universe&lt;/a&gt; Loch Lomond whisky, while a Sussex County Council signpost was added to page 11. Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. The police were no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Willoughby-Drupe%20and%20Marco%20Rizotto\"&gt;Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto&lt;/a&gt;, who had first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Castafiore%20Emerald\"&gt;The Castafiore Emerald&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963), were retroactively added into the background of one scene.\nWith the backgrounds and other elements of the new version drawn by staff members of the Studios, the only thing drawn by Herg\u00e9 in the 1966 version was the characters themselves.\nLater publications.\nCasterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of their collection. In 1986, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition, that they followed in 1996 with the publication of a facsimile of the second, 1943 edition.\nCritical analysis.\n&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Thompson\"&gt;Harry Thompson&lt;/a&gt; thought that \"The Black Island\" expressed a \"convenient, hitherto unsuspected regard for the British\" on Herg\u00e9's behalf, with Britain itself appearing as \"a little quaint\". He thought that it \"outstrips its predecessors\" both artistically and comedically, describing it as \"one of the most popular Tintin stories\". He felt that some of the logically implausible slapstick scenes illustrated \"the last flicker of 1920s Tintin\", but that the 1966 version was \"a fine piece of work and one of the most beautifully drawn Tintin books\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Farr\"&gt;Michael Farr&lt;/a&gt; commented on the \"distinct quality and special popularity\" of \"The Black Island\". He thought that the inclusion of many airplanes and a television in the first version was symptomatic of Herg\u00e9's interest in innovation and &lt;a href=\"modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt;. Commenting on the differences between the third version of the comic and the earlier two, he thought that the latter was \"strongly representative\" of the artistic talents of Studios Herg\u00e9 in the 1960s, but that it was nevertheless inferior, because it had replaced the \"spontaneity and poetry\" of the original with \"over-detailed and fussily accurate\" illustrations.\nJean-Marc and Randy Lofficier described \"The Black Island\" as \"a clever little thriller\" that bore similarities with the popular detective serials of the era. The Lofficiers thought that the 1966 version \"gained in slickness\" but became less atmospheric, awarding it two out of five. Biographer &lt;a href=\"Beno%C3%AEt%20Peeters\"&gt;Beno\u00eet Peeters&lt;/a&gt; thought \"The Black Island\" to be \"a pure detective story\", describing it as \"Remarkably well constructed\" and highlighting that it contrasted the modern world of counterfeiters, airplanes, and television, with the mysteries of superstition and the historic castle. He described it as \"an adventure full of twists and turns\", with the characters Thompson and Thomson being \"on top form\". He nevertheless considered the 1966 version to be \"shorter on charm\" than the earlier versions. Elsewhere he was more critical, stating that \"under the guise of modernization, a real massacre occurred\", and adding that \"the new \"Black Island\" was more than just a failure; it also showed one of the limitations of the Herg\u00e9an system\", in that it was obsessed with repeated redrawing.\nLiterary critic &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marie%20Apostolid%C3%A8s\"&gt;Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; believed that \"The Black Island\" expanded on a variety of themes that Herg\u00e9 had explored in his earlier work, such as the idea of counterfeiting and Snowy's fondness for &lt;a href=\"whisky\"&gt;whisky&lt;/a&gt;. He thought that there was a human-animal link in the story, with Tintin's hair matching Snowy's fur in a similar manner to how Wronzoff's beard matched Ranko's fur coat. However, he added that while Tintin's relationship with Snowy was wholly one based in good, Wronzoff's connection with Ranko is one rooted in evil. By living on an island, Apostolid\u00e8s thought that Wronzoff was like \"a new &lt;a href=\"Robinson%20Crusoe\"&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/a&gt;\", also highlighting that it was the first use of the island theme in Herg\u00e9's work.\nLiterary critic &lt;a href=\"Tom%20McCarthy%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;Tom McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; thought that \"The Black Island\" linked to Herg\u00e9's other \"Adventures\" in various ways; he connected the counterfeit money in the story to the counterfeit idol in \"The Broken Ear\" and the fake bunker in \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\". He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Unicorn\"&gt;The Secret of the Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;\", and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or \"mort\" (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of &lt;a href=\"Marlinspike%20Hall\"&gt;Marlinspike Hall&lt;/a&gt; in \"The Secret of the Unicorn\".\nAdaptations.\n\"The Black Island\" is one of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" that was adapted for the second series of the animated \"&lt;a href=\"Herg%C3%A9%27s%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin\"&gt;Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\" by the Belgian studio &lt;a href=\"Belvision\"&gt;Belvision&lt;/a&gt; in 1957. Belvision's adaptation, directed by Ray Goossens and written by &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Greg\"&gt;Michel Greg&lt;/a&gt;, divided The Black Island up into 5-minute colour episodes that diverted from Herg\u00e9's original plot in a variety of ways. The French studio &lt;a href=\"Ellipse%20Programme\"&gt;Ellipse&lt;/a&gt; and Canadian animation company &lt;a href=\"Nelvana\"&gt;Nelvana&lt;/a&gt; subsequently adapted the comic into a 1991 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Adventures of Tintin&lt;/a&gt;\" television series. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.\nIn 1992, a radio adaption by the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; was first broadcast on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%205%20Live\"&gt;Radio 5&lt;/a&gt;. It was produced by &lt;a href=\"John%20Yorke%20%28producer%29\"&gt;John Yorke&lt;/a&gt;, Tintin was voiced by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Pearce%20%28British%20actor%29\"&gt;Richard Pearce&lt;/a&gt; and Snowy by &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Sachs\"&gt;Andrew Sachs&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 19 March 2010, the British TV network &lt;a href=\"Channel%204\"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a documentary titled \"Dom Joly and The Black Island\" in which the comedian &lt;a href=\"Dom%20Joly\"&gt;Dom Joly&lt;/a&gt; dressed up as Tintin and followed in Tintin's footsteps from &lt;a href=\"Ostend\"&gt;Ostend&lt;/a&gt; to Sussex and then to Scotland. Reviewing the documentary in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Tim Dowling commented: \"It was amusing in parts, charming in others and a little gift for Tintinophiles everywhere. A Tintinologist, I fear, would not learn much he or she didn't already know\"."
