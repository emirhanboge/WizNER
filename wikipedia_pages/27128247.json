    "text": "John Joseph \"Joe\" Hawcridge (28 September 1863 \u2013 1 January 1905), also known by the &lt;a href=\"nickname\"&gt;nickname&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Artful Dodger\", was an English &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1880s. He played at representative level for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, and at club level for &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Three-quarters\"&gt;three-quarter&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Wing\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Centre\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to Tuesday 27 August 1895, Bradford F.C. was a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club, it then became a rugby league club, and since 1907 it has been the &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; (soccer) club &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nJoe Hawcridge was born in &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield\"&gt;Macclesfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheshire\"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;, and he died aged 41 in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, United States.\nPlaying career.\nInternational honours.\nJoe Hawcridge won caps for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; while at Bradford F.C. in 1885 against Wales, and Ireland.\nChange of Code.\nWhen Bradford F.C. converted from the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; code to the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; code on Tuesday 27 August 1895, Joe Hawcridge would have been approximately 31. Consequently, he could have been both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Bradford F.C.\nIn the early years of rugby football the \"goal\" was to score goals, and a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to \"try\" at goal, and \"&lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt;\" the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \"score\" a try, without scoring any points.\nGenealogical information.\nJoe Hawcridge's marriage to Helena Jane (&lt;a href=\"Given%20name%23Name%20at%20birth\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; Wilkinson) (born first \u00bc 1868 in &lt;a href=\"Bradford\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 died July\u2013September 1937 (age 69) in &lt;a href=\"Wharfedale\"&gt;Wharfedale&lt;/a&gt;) was registered during first \u00bc 1888 in &lt;a href=\"Bradford\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; district.\nNote.\nJoe Hawcridge's surname is variously spelt correctly with a \"c\" as Hawcridge, or incorrectly with a \"k\" Hawkridge."
