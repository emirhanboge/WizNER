    "text": "Gaspar Frutuoso (c.1522 in &lt;a href=\"Ponta%20Delgada\"&gt;Ponta Delgada&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1591 in &lt;a href=\"Ribeira%20Grande%2C%20S%C3%A3o%20Miguel\"&gt;Ribeira Grande&lt;/a&gt;) was a Portuguese priest, historian and &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;humanist&lt;/a&gt; from the island of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island\"&gt;S\u00e3o Miguel&lt;/a&gt;, in the Portuguese archipelago of the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt;. His major contribution to &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20history\"&gt;Portuguese history&lt;/a&gt; was his detailed descriptions of the history and geography of the Azores, &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt; and references to &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Cape%20Verde\"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt;, which he published in his six-part tome \"&lt;a href=\"Gaspar%20Frutuoso%23Saudades%20da%20Terra\"&gt;Saudades da Terra&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as \"Saudades do C\u00e9u\". He is normally cited in settlement history of the islands of the Azores.\nBiography.\nGaspar Frutuoso was born in 1522, on the island of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island\"&gt;S\u00e3o Miguel&lt;/a&gt;, son of Frutuoso Dias, a merchant and rural property-owner, and his wife Isabel Fernandes. Little is known of his childhood, apart from references to him working his father's lands during this period.\nThe first trustworthy record about Frutuoso was his admission to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Salamanca\"&gt;University of Salamanca&lt;/a&gt; (in 1548) where he later obtained an &lt;a href=\"Art\"&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt;s certification. At the age of 31 (in 1554), he was ordained during a visit to S\u00e3o Miguel; his records from 1554 to 1555 show him registered as \"presbitero bachiller\". He continued his studies in &lt;a href=\"Salamanca\"&gt;Salamanca&lt;/a&gt; under the noted theologian &lt;a href=\"Domingo%20de%20Soto\"&gt;Domingo de Soto&lt;/a&gt;, the royal confessor of King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (and Charles I of Spain)&lt;/a&gt; and envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Trent\"&gt;Council of Trent&lt;/a&gt;, where he obtained a theology baccalaureate. During his time in Salamanca he became friends with Father Miguel Torres, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, which would later serve him as he was promoting charitable activities in the Azores.\nHe briefly returned to the Azores between 1558 and 1560, where he became &lt;a href=\"parish%20priest\"&gt;parish priest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20%28Lagoa%29\"&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Lagoa%20%28Azores%29\"&gt;Lagoa&lt;/a&gt; (records written by him during this period date his time in the parish).\nIn 1560, he decided to return to Salamanca in order to complete a &lt;a href=\"Doctorate\"&gt;Doctorate&lt;/a&gt; in Theology, but began working with &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; Juli\u00e3o de Alva in &lt;a href=\"Bragan%C3%A7a%20Municipality\"&gt;Bragan\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained until 1563. It is unclear when, and from where, he attained his Doctorate, but he began to use this title from 1565, also when his name began appearing on the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20%C3%89vora\"&gt;University of \u00c9vora&lt;/a&gt;'s registry (an institution of the Society of Jesus), after 1569.\nBy decree, 20 May 1565, he was nominated to be the &lt;a href=\"vicar\"&gt;vicar&lt;/a&gt; and orator at the parochial Church of \"Nossa Senhora da Estrela\" (\"Our Lady of the Star\"), in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Ribeira%20Grande%2C%20S%C3%A3o%20Miguel\"&gt;Ribeira Grande&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held for the next 26 years (until his death). During this time, he was dedicated to the parish, as well as charitable works he contributed towards on and off-island, but still had time writing his 16 manuscripts that included Saudades da Terra, and Saudades do Ceu.\nEver mindful of the politics of the time, during the period of the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Dynasty\"&gt;Philippine Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, he was:\nIn 1566, during the French assault on &lt;a href=\"Funchal\"&gt;Funchal&lt;/a&gt;, he collected funds and wheat for the people of &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe died on 24 August 1591 and was buried in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Estrela, in Ribeira Grande.\nSaudades da Terra.\nSaudades da Terra, literally \"Nostalgic-longing for the Land\", is a six-volume tome that contains observations by the author, of the history and geography of the Atlantic territories of the Kingdom of Portugal, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt; (lands at one time attributed to Portugal). It is a referential work for the understanding of the islands of &lt;a href=\"Macaronesia\"&gt;Macaronesia&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 16th Century. The work is not limited to &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt; and history, but also covers daily life, customs and traditions, &lt;a href=\"genealogy\"&gt;genealogy&lt;/a&gt;, the origins of place names, &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, and affirms Frutuoso's humanist nature, typical of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;. The author is an encyclopedic, literary and artistic observer of the natural phenomenons, preoccupied with experimental &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and speculative on aspects of &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biology\"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineralogy\"&gt;mineralogy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"petrology\"&gt;petrology&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis detailed descriptions are so detailed that they were published into separate volumes which cover:\nThe fifth volume is an elaborate poem, from the perspective of a fictional character, writing in a pastoral style, about the history of two friends that are separated and forced to live far from home. Some biographers have cited this as a deliberate autobiography of Frutuoso and his university friend, the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island\"&gt;Micalense&lt;/a&gt; medic, Gaspar Gon\u00e7alves.\nGaspar Frutuoso apparently attempted to publish his work, going so far as to rework and edit his manuscript (the original has many edits in his hand). For reasons that are never clear, although the Spanish occupation of the island (during the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Union\"&gt;Iberian Union&lt;/a&gt;) may have influenced his decision, he never published the work. The manuscript, along with documents from his library, were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Jesuit%20College%20%28Ponta%20Delgada%29\"&gt;Jesuit College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ponta%20Delgada\"&gt;Ponta Delgada&lt;/a&gt; and preserved until 1760 (when the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; was expelled from Portugal). The manuscript fell into the hands of people who restricted access to the document, until it was donated to the General Committee of &lt;a href=\"Ponta%20Delgada\"&gt;Ponta Delgada&lt;/a&gt;, and incorporated into the holdings of the Public Library and Archive (where it now resides). The work was finally published in 1873, with thirty notes by \u00c1lvaro Rodrigues de Azevedo, and a prologue by the \"Dicion\u00e1rio Universal de Portugu\u00eas Ilustrado\" (\"Illustrated Universal Dictionary of Portugal\"), written by Fernandes Costa. Many partial editions of \"Saudades da Terra\" have been re-published by the \"Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada\" since 1966."
