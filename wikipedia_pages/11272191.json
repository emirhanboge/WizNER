The team achieved promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; in 1947, club's name was changed to \"CSM Media\u0219\" in the same year. At the end of the season, the team managed to secure a comfortable 11th place out of 16, in its first Divizia A season.

After the second round, disgruntled players complained to the press and the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Romanian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FRF) about the poor training conditions at the club. FRF decided to allow the factory \"Zorile Ro\u0219ii\" (Red Dawn) to take the ownership of the club. The name of the team was also changed to \"Zorile Ro\u0219ii Media\u0219\". Later that season the team merged with Vitrometan Media\u0219.

The club carried the following names: \"Partizanul\" (1950\u201351), \"Flacara\" (1951\u201356), \"Energia\" (1956\u201358), \"Gaz Metan\" (1958\u201360), and \"CSM Media\u0219\" (1960\u20131963). The final name change took place in 1963 when the club reverted to its former \"Gaz Metan Media\u0219\" name. In 1951, the club achieved its most significant domestic performance by reaching the final stage of the Romanian Cup as a &lt;a href=\"Divizia%20B\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt; team. Led from the bench by the famous &lt;a href=\"%C8%98tefan%20Dobay\"&gt;\u0218tefan Dobay&lt;/a&gt;, Flac\u0103ra lost 3\u20131 in overtime against &lt;a href=\"CCA%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;CCA Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; (current &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;).
