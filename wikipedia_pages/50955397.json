    "text": "Eoconodontus is an extinct genus of conodonts of the Late Cambrian. It is a two-elements (rounded and compressed) genus from the \"&lt;a href=\"Proconodontus\"&gt;Proconodontus&lt;/a&gt;\" lineage.\nUse in stratigraphy.\nIt is suggested that \"Eoconodontus notchpeakensis\" can be a marker of the &lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20Stage%2010\"&gt;Stage 10&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Furongian\"&gt;Furongian&lt;/a&gt; the fourth and final series of the Cambrian.\nIn 2006, a working group proposed the first appearance of \"&lt;a href=\"Cordylodus%20andresi\"&gt;Cordylodus andresi&lt;/a&gt;\". Currently the first appearance of \"E. notchpeakensis\" is favored by many authors because it is globally widespread and is independent of &lt;a href=\"facies\"&gt;facies&lt;/a&gt; (known from continental rise to peritidal environments).\nThe \"Eoconodontus notchpeakensis\" proposal would also incorporate a non-biostratigraphic marker to correlate the beginning of Stage 10 globally. A carbon isotope excursion (the HERB-event) occurs in the lower part of the \"E. notchpeakensis\" range."
