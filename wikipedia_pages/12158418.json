    "text": "The culture of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Australian state of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, encompasses the city's artistic, culinary, literary, musical, political and social elements. Since its founding as a British settlement in 1835, Melbourne has been culturally influenced by &lt;a href=\"culture%20of%20Europe\"&gt;European culture&lt;/a&gt;, particularly that of the British Isles. During the 1850s &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20gold%20rush\"&gt;Victorian gold rush&lt;/a&gt; and in the decades the immediately followed, immigrants from many other parts of the world, notably China and the Americas, helped shape Melbourne's culture. Over time, Melbourne has become the birthplace of a number of unique cultural traits and institutions, and today it is one of the world's most multicultural cities.\nTraditionally acclaimed as Australia's \"cultural capital\", Melbourne topped the &lt;a href=\"Economist%20Intelligence%20Unit\"&gt;Economist Intelligence Unit&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Global%20Liveability%20Ranking\"&gt;annual ranking&lt;/a&gt; of the world's &lt;a href=\"most%20liveable%20cities\"&gt;most liveable cities&lt;/a&gt; throughout much of the 2010s, based in part on its cultural attributes.\nOverview.\nMelbourne hosts and supports many cultural institutions, such as museums, galleries, events, festivals, public/&lt;a href=\"street%20art\"&gt;street art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"popular%20music\"&gt;popular music&lt;/a&gt;, live music, film, &lt;a href=\"independent%20music\"&gt;independent music&lt;/a&gt; and literary talks, &lt;a href=\"independent%20film\"&gt;independent film&lt;/a&gt; and fashion. The city celebrates a wide variety of major annual cultural events, including local, national and international events. A number of cultural hubs also exist in the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;Victorian Arts Precinct&lt;/a&gt;, with its distinctive spire, and &lt;a href=\"Federation%20Square\"&gt;Federation Square&lt;/a&gt;, one of the city's main cultural hubs and tourist centres that celebrated its ten-year anniversary in 2012. Federation Square's distinctive architecture, large digital screen and public space attracts congregations, rallies and public audiences for sporting events.\nArts.\nArchitecture.\nMelbourne's buildings and structures feature a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architectural designs&lt;/a&gt;, and the city is home to the Royal Exhibition Building, the first Australian building to be listed on the World Heritage Register.\nAustralia's second oldest architectural firm, and one of the world's oldest, &lt;a href=\"Bates%20Smart\"&gt;Bates Smart&lt;/a&gt;, is based in Melbourne.\nSome of Australia's most prolific architects have originated from Melbourne, including &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Reed%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Joseph Reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Wardell\"&gt;William Wardell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20James%20Clark\"&gt;John James Clark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20D%27Ebro\"&gt;Charles D'Ebro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Webb%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Charles Webb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Pitt%20%28architect%29\"&gt;William Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nahum%20Barnet\"&gt;Nahum Barnet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Norris\"&gt;Harry Norris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Roy%20Grounds\"&gt;Sir Roy Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Boyd%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Robin Boyd&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, Melbourne has produced internationally recognised architectural firms, including &lt;a href=\"Denton%20Corker%20Marshall\"&gt;Denton Corker Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Katsalidis\"&gt;Fender Katsalidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Jackson\"&gt;Daryl Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peddle%20Thorp\"&gt;Peddle Thorp&lt;/a&gt;, as well as local award-winning trendsetters, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20%26amp%3B%20Corrigan\"&gt;Edmund &amp; Corrigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashton%20Raggatt%20McDougall\"&gt;Ashton Raggatt McDougall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Marsh\"&gt;Wood Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiterature.\nMelbourne's literary history is rich and diverse. The &lt;a href=\"State%20Library%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;State Library of Victoria&lt;/a&gt; was the first major cultural institution to be established in Melbourne since its founding in 1854, and is one of Australia's oldest cultural institutions. The library holds more than two million books and 16,000 serials, and is a part of an extensive network of public and university libraries across the city. A wide range of independent bookstores also exist in the city, as well as a variety of larger bookstore chains, and in 1960, the first children's bookstore in Australia, The Little Bookroom, was opened. The &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Language%20Bookshop\"&gt;Foreign Language Bookshop&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest and largest language bookshop in &lt;a href=\"Australasia\"&gt;Australasia&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1938 in Bourke Street as a free lending library. The primary aim of the business was to reduce migrant isolation, particularly for European migrants disembarking from ships into Australia.\nIn the decades following the gold rush, Melbourne was Australia's undisputed literary capital, famously referred to by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Kendall%20%28poet%29\"&gt;Henry Kendall&lt;/a&gt; as \"that wild bleak Bohemia south of the &lt;a href=\"Murray%20River\"&gt;Murray&lt;/a&gt;\". During this time, Melbourne-based writers and poets &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Lindsay%20Gordon\"&gt;Adam Lindsay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Clarke\"&gt;Marcus Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rolf%20Boldrewood\"&gt;Rolf Boldrewood&lt;/a&gt; produced classic visions of colonial life and created a nascent national literature.\nMelbourne's literary publishing sector is the largest in Australia, including the largest number of independent publishers, and presents two of Australia's most significant literary awards: the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards and the Melbourne Prize for Literature. Melbourne is the setting of many significant novels including &lt;a href=\"Fergus%20Hume\"&gt;Fergus Hume&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mystery%20of%20a%20Hansom%20Cab\"&gt;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&lt;/a&gt;\" (1886), &lt;a href=\"George%20Johnston%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;George Johnston&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Brother%20Jack\"&gt;My Brother Jack&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964), &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Garner\"&gt;Helen Garner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Grip%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Monkey Grip&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977) and &lt;a href=\"Christos%20Tsiolkas\"&gt;Christos Tsiolkas&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Slap%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Slap&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008). \"The Mystery of a Hanson Cab\" was the best-selling detective novel of the 19th century. Garner's seminal 1977 novel \"Monkey Grip\" achieved notability for capturing Melbourne's burgeoning &lt;a href=\"counter-culture\"&gt;counter-culture&lt;/a&gt; and Bohemia scene, as well as the lives of communal single-mothers, junkies and artists living in sharehouses in the inner city neighbourhoods of &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Carlton&lt;/a&gt;. It is now considered one of Australia's earliest and most important contemporary novels, with the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; selecting it as one of \"100 stories that shaped the world\" \u2013 the only Australian novel on the list. Other contemporary writers from Melbourne include &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20Greenwood\"&gt;Kerry Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germaine%20Greer\"&gt;Germaine Greer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephanie%20Alexander\"&gt;Stephanie Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Birch\"&gt;Tony Birch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Dickins\"&gt;Barry Dickins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Writers%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne Writers Festival&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1986 and is an annual, two-week literary festival that hosts keynotes, panels and workshops by a wide range of local and international guests. Since beginning as a one-day zine fair in 2004, the Emerging Writers' Festival has expanded to ten days of events, workshops, and panel discussions that are focused on the development of writers. Annually across Melbourne there are many local writers\u2019 festivals including the Bayside Literary Festival, Williamstown Literary Festival and Glen Eira Storytelling Festival. In addition to book readings by local authors, many of these events provide opportunities for local writers to develop their skills via workshops and short-story competitions.\nIn August 2008, Melbourne was the second city in the world to be recognised as a &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Literature\"&gt;City of Literature&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Wheeler%20Centre\"&gt;Wheeler Centre&lt;/a&gt; for Books, Writing and Ideas is a literary and publishing centre founded as part of Melbourne's successful bid. As well as programming literary events, debates and awards, the Wheeler Centre hosts literary organisations such as the Melbourne Writers\u2019 Festival, Emerging Writers\u2019 Festival, SPUNC, Australian Poetry, &lt;a href=\"Express%20Media\"&gt;Express Media&lt;/a&gt;, Writers Victoria and the Melbourne City of Literature Office.\nOpera and theatre.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Ballet%20Company\"&gt;Australian Ballet Company&lt;/a&gt; is based in Melbourne and the National Theatre in &lt;a href=\"St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;St Kilda&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt; school in Australia. Ballet is a regular feature at the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;Victorian Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt; and National Theatre venues. Melbourne is the second home of &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Australia\"&gt;Opera Australia&lt;/a&gt; after it merged with Victoria State Opera in 1996. The &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Opera%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;Victorian Opera&lt;/a&gt; held its inaugural season in 2006 and operates in various Melbourne venues.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Melbourne%20Philharmonic\"&gt;Royal Melbourne Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 1853, making it Australia's oldest musical organisation and the only orchestra in Australia to be bestowed \"royal\" status. The Victoria Orchestra, based in Melbourne, was Australia's first professional orchestra and performed during the period from 1888 to 1891. The &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Melbourne Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, first assembled in 1906, is now the city's premier orchestra and tours internationally.\nThere are more theatres and performance venues in Melbourne than any other city in Australia. In &lt;a href=\"Southbank%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Southbank, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20Centre%20Melbourne\"&gt;Arts Centre Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; is a hub of performing arts venues and is the cornerstone of the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Arts%20Precinct\"&gt;Melbourne Arts Precinct&lt;/a&gt; which also includes the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Recital%20Centre\"&gt;Melbourne Recital Centre&lt;/a&gt; and Southbank Theatre, home of the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Melbourne Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;. In the city's &lt;a href=\"East%20End%20Theatre%20District\"&gt;East End Theatre District&lt;/a&gt;, notable theatres include the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Princess Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Regent Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Theatre\"&gt;Forum Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comedy%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Comedy Theatre&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Her Majesty's Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Theatre\"&gt;Palais Theatre&lt;/a&gt; is a significant music venue in nearby St Kilda.\nSeveral professional theatre companies operate in Melbourne, of which the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Melbourne Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest professional theatre company in Australia, has the most institutional support of any in Australia. There is also a range of smaller professional theatre companies in Melbourne, including the Malthouse, &lt;a href=\"La%20Mama%20Theatre%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;La Mama&lt;/a&gt; in Carlton, Cariad Productions, the Red Stitch Actors Theatre and Theatreworks in St Kilda. An array of amateur companies also exist, such as OXAGEN Productions, the Malvern Theatre Company, CLOC, Catchment Players of Darebin, MLOC Productions, Theatrical Incorporated, &lt;a href=\"Altona%20City%20Theatre\"&gt;Altona City Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, Windmill Theatre Company and Dandenong Theatre Company.\nComedy.\nMelbourne is known throughout both Australia and the world as a centre of comedy, with the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20International%20Comedy%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne International Comedy Festival&lt;/a&gt; listed as one of the three largest &lt;a href=\"stand-up%20comedy\"&gt;stand-up comedy&lt;/a&gt; festivals in the world. The city has also produced many of Australia's top-rating comedy television and radio shows, and many of the country's leading comedians either come from the city or .\nMelbourne-born satirist &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Humphries\"&gt;Barry Humphries&lt;/a&gt; created his main character, \"&lt;a href=\"Dame%20Edna%20Everage\"&gt;Dame Edna Everage&lt;/a&gt;\", as a comic version of a suburban &lt;a href=\"homemaker\"&gt;homemaker&lt;/a&gt;. Through Everage, Humphries has written and performed cutting odes to Melbourne &lt;a href=\"mores\"&gt;mores&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Moonee%20Ponds%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Moonee Ponds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highett%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Highett&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The character was retired in mid-2012 during the \"Eat Pray Laugh\" farewell tour.\nDance events.\nMelbourne also hosted the 2008 World Latin American Dance Championships. The competition was held in the Vodafone Arena and immediately following the Australian Dancesport Championships. The Australian Dancesport championships will commence on 10 December 2008 and the World Latin Championships will be held on 14 December 2008.\nVisual arts.\nThe Melbourne arts scene is vibrant and the city hosts the annual &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20International%20Arts%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne International Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt; as a celebration of its artistic tradition.\nIn the 1880s, a group of Melbourne artists formed the first distinctive Australian school of painting. Named the &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%20School\"&gt;Heidelberg School&lt;/a&gt;, and latterly described as &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Impressionism\"&gt;Australian Impressionism&lt;/a&gt;, the movement's four principle artists were &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Roberts\"&gt;Tom Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Streeton\"&gt;Arthur Streeton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Conder\"&gt;Charles Conder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20McCubbin\"&gt;Frederick McCubbin&lt;/a&gt;. Together they painted \"&lt;a href=\"en%20plein%20air\"&gt;en plein air&lt;/a&gt;\" at artists' camps set up around Melbourne's rural suburbs, including &lt;a href=\"Box%20Hill%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Box Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to capture the unique light, colour and atmosphere of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20bush\"&gt;Australian bush&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the group's most famous works from this period are large-scale sunlit landscapes and pastoral figure subjects, however they also explored Melbourne's urban scenery, local history (including pioneer and &lt;a href=\"bushranger\"&gt;bushranger&lt;/a&gt; themes), beaches (often along &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20Bay\"&gt;Port Phillip Bay&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mentone%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Mentone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandringham%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Sandringham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beaumaris%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Beaumaris&lt;/a&gt;), and did portraits of wealthy Melburnians from their inner-city studios. In 1889 they staged the &lt;a href=\"9%20by%205%20Impression%20Exhibition\"&gt;9 by 5 Impression Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; opposite the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Melbourne Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;. It is regarded as a landmark event in Australian art history.\nModernist &lt;a href=\"John%20Brack\"&gt;John Brack&lt;/a&gt; captured the idiosyncrasies of daily life in Melbourne. His most iconic painting, \"&lt;a href=\"Collins%20Street.%2C%205%20pm\"&gt;Collins Street., 5 pm&lt;/a&gt;\" (1955), shows grim-faced pedestrians moving in unison down &lt;a href=\"Collins%20Street%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Collins Street&lt;/a&gt;. It was voted by patrons in 2011 as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;National Gallery of Victoria&lt;/a&gt;'s most popular work.\nThere are more than 100 galleries in Melbourne. In the city, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ngv.vic.gov.au/\"&gt;NGV International&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060714012130/http%3A//www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvaustralia/\"&gt;Ian Potter Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Potter%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Ian Potter Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Centre%20for%20Contemporary%20Art\"&gt;Australian Centre for Contemporary Art&lt;/a&gt;, Flinders Lane Gallery, Anna Schwartz Gallery, McCulloch Gallery, and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Centre%20for%20the%20Moving%20Image\"&gt;Australian Centre for the Moving Image&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an organisation dedicated to the moving image in all its forms, from film and &lt;a href=\"animation\"&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt;s and television \u2014 have been established. The &lt;a href=\"Gertrude%20Contemporary%20Art%20Spaces\"&gt;Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20for%20Contemporary%20Photography\"&gt;Centre for Contemporary Photography&lt;/a&gt;, both based in &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt;, are examples of galleries in the inner-city. Suburban venues also exist, such as &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art\"&gt;Heide Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a&gt;, located in the north-eastern region of the city. The \"Art Almanac\" website, promoting itself as \"Australia's Monthly Briefing on Art\", publishes a monthly list of activities for Melbourne's galleries and art services, in addition to the other Australian states, covering more than 550 art galleries throughout the entire nation; the organisation also publishes a hard copy almanac each month.\nMelbourne is home to a large array of public artworks, statues and sculptures. &lt;a href=\"Sculptor\"&gt;Sculptor&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Halpern\"&gt;Deborah Halpern&lt;/a&gt; have played a large part in enhancing many of the city's public spaces with their iconic and larger-than-life works. In more modern times, the city has become well known for &lt;a href=\"stencil%20graffiti\"&gt;stencil graffiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; that appears in the city's numerous laneways.\nThe city has major &lt;a href=\"film%20festival\"&gt;film festival&lt;/a&gt;s including the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Queer%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne Queer Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Underground%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne Underground Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20International%20Animation%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne International Animation Festival&lt;/a&gt;, featuring several of the city's major cinemas. The Central City Studios in Melbourne Docklands, constructed in 2005, has seen the production of several big budget films.\nMelbourne is also known for &lt;a href=\"fashion\"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;. The city, once a leader in the &lt;a href=\"textile%20industry\"&gt;textile industry&lt;/a&gt;, retains a small manufacturing base, but has diversified into the more creative areas of the fashion industry. The &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Fashion%20Festival\"&gt;Melbourne Fashion Festival&lt;/a&gt; is one of the city's annual events, while the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Spring%20Racing%20Carnival\"&gt;Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Logies\"&gt;Logies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brownlow%20Medal\"&gt;Brownlow Medal&lt;/a&gt; dinner are three of the biggest annual &lt;a href=\"red%20carpet\"&gt;red carpet&lt;/a&gt; events in the country.\n&lt;a href=\"Street%20Art%20in%20Melbourne\"&gt;Street Art in Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; is internationally recognised. International artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Banksy\"&gt;Banksy&lt;/a&gt;, have painted work in Melbourne.\nMusic.\nMelbourne has one of the most highly regarded live music scenes in the world. In terms of the quality and number of venues, arguably, it is comparable with cities such as &lt;a href=\"Austin\"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of venues throughout Melbourne host live music, some of which host live music every night of the week.\nOperatic soprano &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Nellie%20Melba\"&gt;Dame Nellie Melba&lt;/a&gt;, one of the late &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Era\"&gt;Victorian Era&lt;/a&gt;'s most famous singers, took her stage name from her native Melbourne, her stage name also being the source of the term \u2018&lt;a href=\"melba%20toast\"&gt;melba toast&lt;/a&gt;\u2019.\nIn 1934 Clement Williams recorded \"Let\u2019s Take a Trip to Melbourne\", written by Jack O'Hagan. Singer &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Kelly%20%28Australian%20musician%29\"&gt;Paul Kelly&lt;/a&gt; has written several well-known songs about aspects of the city close to the heart of many Melburnians, notably \"&lt;a href=\"Leaps%20and%20Bounds%20%28song%29\"&gt;Leaps And Bounds&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"From%20St%20Kilda%20to%20King%27s%20Cross\"&gt;From St Kilda to King's Cross&lt;/a&gt;\", while &lt;a href=\"Skyhooks%20%28band%29\"&gt;Skyhooks&lt;/a&gt; also wrote some more tongue-in-cheek songs about Melbourne. \"Balwyn Calling\", \"Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)\" and \"Toorak Cowboy\" are examples. Melbourne-originated indie-rock band &lt;a href=\"The%20Living%20End\"&gt;The Living End&lt;/a&gt; wrote the song \"West End Riot\" about differences between eastern and western suburbs in Melbourne's inner city.\nMelbourne's &lt;a href=\"Indie%20%28music%29\"&gt;independent music&lt;/a&gt; scene flourished in the 1970s and 1980s with strong support from local venues, street press, community radio stations, and numerous record labels. Several distinct &lt;a href=\"post-punk\"&gt;post-punk&lt;/a&gt; scenes emerged in the inner suburbs, each sharing a &lt;a href=\"DIY%20ethic\"&gt;DIY ethic&lt;/a&gt; and a passion for experimentation. Led by the &lt;a href=\"Primitive%20Calculators\"&gt;Primitive Calculators&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"little%20band%20scene\"&gt;little band scene&lt;/a&gt; gave rise to groups such as &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Can%20Dance\"&gt;Dead Can Dance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunters%20%26amp%3B%20Collectors\"&gt;Hunters &amp; Collectors&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Clifton%20Hill%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Clifton Hill&lt;/a&gt;, collaborations occurred between conceptual composers, such as &lt;a href=\"David%20Chesworth\"&gt;David Chesworth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Brophy\"&gt;Philip Brophy&lt;/a&gt;, and experimental punk outfits, namely &lt;a href=\"Tsk%20Tsk%20Tsk\"&gt;Tsk Tsk Tsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essendon%20Airport%20%28band%29\"&gt;Essendon Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt;-tinged &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Talking\"&gt;I'm Talking&lt;/a&gt;, which launched the career of &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Ceberano\"&gt;Kate Ceberano&lt;/a&gt;. St Kilda's &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ballroom%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;Crystal Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; became the stomping ground for darker, noisier punk groups, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Moodists\"&gt;The Moodists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20the%20City%20Solution\"&gt;Crime and the City Solution&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Cave\"&gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Birthday%20Party%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Birthday Party&lt;/a&gt;.

The film depicted the denizens of Melbourne quietly slipping off into eternity as the last victims of a global &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20holocaust\"&gt;nuclear holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. It was filmed on location in and around Melbourne. Similar filming was undertaken when a 2000 &lt;a href=\"television%20movie\"&gt;television movie&lt;/a&gt; remake was produced.\nThe world's first &lt;a href=\"feature%20film\"&gt;feature film&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20the%20Kelly%20Gang\"&gt;The Story of the Kelly Gang&lt;/a&gt;\", was filmed in Melbourne in 1906.
