The college's football program began in 1907, lasting until 1930, when it was discontinued due to financial reasons. In 1982, the decision was made to re-establish a football program at the school, with the school resuming football operations the following year. Initially, the Panthers were an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20III\"&gt;NCAA Division III&lt;/a&gt; team, unaffiliated with any conference. They moved into Division II beginning with the 1994 football season.\nHistory.\n1907\u20131930.\nNot much information is available regarding the Panthers teams of the early 20th century. The team played teams such as &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20University\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20University\"&gt;Xavier&lt;/a&gt;. According to the scant material available through Fanbase.com, they did not have much success during this period. Eventually, due to financial reasons, the football program was discontinued after the 1930 season.\nDivision III \u2013 1983\u20131993.\n1983\u20131989.\nWhen the football program was re-established at Kentucky Wesleyan in 1983, the school played at the Division III level as an independent school, unaffiliated with any conference. That first season, they finished with a 3\u20135 record, and they followed that with another nine straight losing seasons before posting a 6\u20134 record in 1993. The Panther's first coach after the re-establishment of the program was Billy Mitchell, who compiled a record of 22\u201341\u20133 during his seven seasons.\n1990\u20131993.\nMitchell was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Awrey\"&gt;Randy Awrey&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the defensive coordinator for four years at another Division III school, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20University\"&gt;St. Lawrence University&lt;/a&gt;. He posted four losing seasons, before posting the school's first winning season in 1993 at 6\u20134.

In his nine years as head coach, from 1994 to 2002, Johnson's overall record was 34\u201358. Those 34 wins are still the most by any Kentucky Wesleyan football coach. While he had a losing record during his tenure, the Panthers played NCAA &lt;a href=\"Division%20I-AA\"&gt;Division I-AA&lt;/a&gt; teams 26 times, losing all 26 games. Johnson had two winning seasons as KWC's head football coach, 6\u20134 in 1997 and 7\u20134 in 1999.

The 2001 and 2002 teams finished with a combined record of 2\u201319, but WR Corey Jordan, LB Vince Brodt, and LB Frank Wintrich, were named NCAA Division II Mid-Major 1st Team All-Americans by Don Hansen's \"National Weekly Football Gazette\" for 2001. Following the 2002 season, offensive lineman Jake Colson (1998\u20132002) was selected as an NCAA Division II Mid-Major 1st Team All-American by Don Hansen's \"National Weekly Football Gazette\". Following consecutive one-win seasons, John Johnson's tenure at Kentucky Wesleyan ended January 1, 2003.\n2003\u2013present.\nCurrent head coach, Brent Holsclaw, a former Kentucky Wesleyan quarterback, was hired in January 2002. Through the 2013 football season, Holsclaw's overall record at Kentucky Wesleyan is 24\u201394. In Holsclaw's first season as KWC's head football coach, Holsclaw's 2003 Panthers finished 1\u20139.

In 2006 the Panthers returned to NCAA Division II, becoming a charter member of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;Great Lakes Football Conference&lt;/a&gt;. The 2006 Panthers finished 0\u201311; the eleven losses were the most in school history. The 2013 team under Holsclaw, in his 11th season, equaled their worst season in 2006 by going 0\u201311.\nFacilities.\nFrom 1983 to 2003 the Kentucky Wesleyan Football team played their home games at Owensboro area high schools. In 2004, the Panthers began playing their home football games at Bullet Wilson Field, an on-campus field completed prior to the 2004 football season. The playing surface at Bullet Wilson Field features &lt;a href=\"FieldTurf\"&gt;FieldTurf&lt;/a&gt;, an artificial playing surface. The stadium around the field underwent a major upgrade project following the 2006 season. When the upgrade was completed the home of the Panthers football team was to be known as Steele Stadium (Bullet Wilson Field).\nAlumni in the pros.\nThree former Kentucky Wesleyan football players have played in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Football%20League%20%281987-2008%29\"&gt;Arena Football League&lt;/a&gt; (AFL).
