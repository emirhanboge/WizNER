    "text": "Latinka Perovi\u0107 (; born 4 October 1933) is a &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;n historian and former politician. During the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; Perovi\u0107 was a secretary general of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;League of Communists of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; in period between 1968\u22121972. In 1972 Federal &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;League of Communists of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; dismissed her from her position together with &lt;a href=\"Marko%20Nikezi%C4%87\"&gt;Marko Nikezi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirko%20Tepavac\"&gt;Mirko Tepavac&lt;/a&gt; under the accusation that they were excessively &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;. Dismissal of Serbian liberals in 1972 followed an earlier dismissal of Croatian nationalists of the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Spring\"&gt;Croatian Spring&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing her removal from active politics, Perovi\u0107 focused on scientific work at the Institute for the History of the Labor Movement of Serbia (modern day Institute for Recent History of Serbia). During the 1990s &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Wars\"&gt;Yugoslav Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Perovi\u0107 was one of the sharpest critics of &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20nationalism\"&gt;Serbian nationalism&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87\"&gt;Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and his regime.\nBiography.\nShe was born in &lt;a href=\"Kragujevac\"&gt;Kragujevac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; in 1933. She graduated in history at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Belgrade\"&gt;University of Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; and earned a &lt;a href=\"PhD\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; degree in political science 1975 at the same university.\nAt the age of 27, she was already &lt;a href=\"president%20%28corporate%20title%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conference%20for%20the%20Women%27s%20Social%20Activity%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Conference for the Women's Social Activity of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (1960-1964). Perovi\u0107 was Secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;League of Communists of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; from 1968 to 1972. She was considered the most influential woman in Serbia at that time and the only one who did not gain her position based on marriage with a more powerful man than herself, but rather through her own intelligence, competence and ambition.\nIn 1972 &lt;a href=\"Marko%20Nikezi%C4%87\"&gt;Marko Nikezi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (the president of the CC of the LCS) and Perovi\u0107 were removed from their positions because &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Broz%20Tito\"&gt;Josip Broz Tito&lt;/a&gt; considered their views too liberal. After that, she never returned to politics. Perovi\u0107 devoted herself to historical research and became known as one of the most prominent experts on Serbian history from the 19th century onwards.\nFrom 1976 to 1998 Perovi\u0107 worked at the Institute for Recent History of Serbia. In her writings and studies on modern Serbia, she often emphasizes that Serbia needs a politician who would publicly claim responsibility for the destruction wrought in the former Yugoslavia in order to help the reconciliation with the neighboring states and prevent the recurrence of this kind of tragedy. She was opposed to the regime of &lt;a href=\"Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87\"&gt;Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1993 Perovi\u0107 has been an &lt;a href=\"editor%20in%20chief\"&gt;editor in chief&lt;/a&gt; of \"Currents of History\" magazine. She rarely appears in public or gives interviews.\nSelected works.\n2010 book \"Facts and Interpretations. Two Conversations with Latinka Perovic\" included detailed bibliography of Latinka Perovi\u0107 with the list of 8 monographs, 10 historical source-books with introductory studies on 19th century, 9 historical source-books with introductory studies on 20th and 21st century, 18 forewords and postscripts, 78 studies, discussions and articles and 13 noticed reviews. Bibliography did not include articles, interviews, and speeches on book promotions, which have been published in various newspapers and magazines as well as obituaries. Perovi\u0107 continued writing in the following years. Her 2015 book \"\"Dominantna i ne\u017eeljena elita\" ()\" initiated critical response from Croatian Sociologist &lt;a href=\"Mira%20Bogdanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Mira Bogdanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; who in her 2016 book \"\"Elitisti\u010dki pasijans: Povijesni revizionizam Latinke Perovi\u0107\" ()\" criticized Perovi\u0107 for inventing concepts of dominant and unwanted elites which do not exist in Sociological science."
