    "text": "Duriense is a &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20wine\"&gt;Portuguese wine&lt;/a&gt; region covering the same area as the &lt;a href=\"Douro%20DOC\"&gt;Douro DOC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Port%20wine\"&gt;Port wine&lt;/a&gt; region. In difference from Douro DOC, Duriense VR is a designation at the lower \"&lt;a href=\"Vinho%20Regional\"&gt;Vinho Regional&lt;/a&gt;\" (VR) level, which corresponds to &lt;a href=\"table%20wine\"&gt;table wine&lt;/a&gt;s with a geographical indication under &lt;a href=\"European%20Union%20wine%20regulations\"&gt;European Union wine regulations&lt;/a&gt;, similar to a &lt;a href=\"French%20%28wine%29\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"vin%20de%20pays\"&gt;vin de pays&lt;/a&gt;\" region. Thus, it is the simpler or less typical wines of the Douro region that are sold using a Duriense VR label.\nBefore the creation of a separate Duriense VR, the Douro vineyards were part of the former &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%A1s-os-Montes%20VR\"&gt;Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes VR&lt;/a&gt;, which is now called &lt;a href=\"Transmontano%20VR\"&gt;Transmontano VR&lt;/a&gt; and no longer includes the Douro vineyards.\n&lt;a href=\"Donzelinho%20branco\"&gt;Donzelinho branco&lt;/a&gt; is one of the authorized grape permitted to be blended in the wines of Duriense."
