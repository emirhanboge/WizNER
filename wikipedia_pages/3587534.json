    "text": "Ben Hope () is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It is the most northerly &lt;a href=\"Munro\"&gt;Munro&lt;/a&gt;, standing alone in the &lt;a href=\"Flow%20Country\"&gt;Flow Country&lt;/a&gt; (a region of bumpy, peat-covered moorland) south-east of Loch Hope in &lt;a href=\"Sutherland\"&gt;Sutherland&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain is a roughly triangular wedge, with a great crag on the west, with two lower shoulders to the south and northeast. &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20plant\"&gt;Alpine flowers&lt;/a&gt; are abundant in season, although the ground is very rocky.\nAscent.\nThe principal route to the summit starts in &lt;a href=\"Strathmore%2C%20Sutherland\"&gt;Strathmore&lt;/a&gt;, to the west of the mountain, where there is parking off a small road. The route lies along the Allt-na-caillich &lt;a href=\"burn%20%28topography%29\"&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; which flows down through a gap in the west-facing crags. The route is steep, but well marked with occasional &lt;a href=\"cairn\"&gt;cairn&lt;/a&gt;s and not exposed. There is little available &lt;a href=\"scrambling\"&gt;scrambling&lt;/a&gt;. \nApproach from the east is rare, as there is a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not possible for walkers, as there is no path between the crags.\nThe view from the summit includes the &lt;a href=\"Pentland%20Firth\"&gt;Pentland Firth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Eriboll\"&gt;Loch Eriboll&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby mountains of &lt;a href=\"Arkle%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Arkle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Foinaven\"&gt;Foinaven&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Orkney%20Islands\"&gt;Orkney Islands&lt;/a&gt; are visible on a clear day.\nJust south of the Allt-na-caillich burn on the Strathmore road is the D\u00f9n Dornaigil &lt;a href=\"Broch\"&gt;Broch&lt;/a&gt;."
