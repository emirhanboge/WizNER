She was the first clipper owned by &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Willis%20Shipping%20Line\"&gt;Jock Willis Shipping Line&lt;/a&gt;. She was a fast sailer, being the second ship home in the 1858-59 tea season. She was a favourite of John Willis senior.\nConstruction.\n\"Lammermuir\" measured 178'0\" \u00d7 34'0\" \u00d7 22'0\", with tonnage 952 NRT. Whilst she did not set any sails above &lt;a href=\"Royal%20%28sail%29\"&gt;royals&lt;/a&gt;, she did have a great spread of sail.\nLoss of the ship.\nWhen she was wrecked on the Amherst Reef in the Macclesfield Channel, &lt;a href=\"Gaspar%20Strait\"&gt;Gaspar Strait&lt;/a&gt; on 31 December 1863, Jock \"White Hat\" Willis commissioned another ship by the same name, the \"&lt;a href=\"Lammermuir%20%281864%20clipper%29\"&gt;Lammermuir&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1864.\nThe wreck of the original \"Lammermuir\" was still visible above the water line in August 1866 when the new \"Lammermuir\" sailed past en route to &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and also later in 1874."
