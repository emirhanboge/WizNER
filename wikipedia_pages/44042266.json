    "text": "The Rampurva capitals are the &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;capitals&lt;/a&gt; of a pair of &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Ashoka\"&gt;Ashoka Pillars&lt;/a&gt; discovered in by &lt;a href=\"A.%20C.%20L.%20Carlleyle\"&gt;A. C. L. Carlleyle&lt;/a&gt;. The archaeological site is called Rampurva, and is located in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Champaran%20district\"&gt;West Champaran district&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n state of &lt;a href=\"Bihar\"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;, situated very close to the border with &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. The lion capital is now in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Museum\"&gt;Indian Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kolkota\"&gt;Kolkota&lt;/a&gt;, while the bull capital is located at the center of the porch of the &lt;a href=\"Rashtrapati%20Bhavan\"&gt;Rashtrapati Bhavan&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian Presidential Palace.\nBuddhist significance.\n&lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Waddell\"&gt;Waddell&lt;/a&gt; in 1896 suggested that the death or &lt;a href=\"parinirvana\"&gt;parinirvana&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gautama%20Buddha\"&gt;Gautama Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was in the region of Rampurva: \"I believe that Kus\u012bnagara, where the Buddha died may be ultimately found to the North of &lt;a href=\"Bettiah\"&gt;Bettiah&lt;/a&gt;, and in the line of the A\u00e7\u014dka pillars which lead hither from &lt;a href=\"Patna\"&gt;Patna&lt;/a&gt; (P\u0101\u021baliputra).\" Modern scholarship, based on archaeological evidence, believes that the Buddha died in &lt;a href=\"Kushinagar\"&gt;Kushinagar&lt;/a&gt; (Uttar Pradesh).\nRampurava lion capital.\nThe lion pillar is inscribed with the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Pillar%20Edicts\"&gt;Major Pillar Edicts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Edicts%20of%20Ashoka\"&gt;Edicts of Ashoka&lt;/a&gt;, Pillar Edicts I, II, III, IV, V, VI.\nRampurva bull capital.\nThe Rampurva bull capital is noted as one of the seven remaining animal &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;capitals&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Ashoka\"&gt;Pillars of Ashoka&lt;/a&gt;. It is composed of a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20plants%20known%20as%20lotus\"&gt;lotiform&lt;/a&gt; base, with an &lt;a href=\"abacus%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;abacus&lt;/a&gt; decorated with floral designs, and the realistic depiction of a &lt;a href=\"zebu\"&gt;zebu&lt;/a&gt; bull. \nThe abacus in particular displays a strong influence of &lt;a href=\"Greek%20art\"&gt;Greek art&lt;/a&gt;: it is composed of &lt;a href=\"honeysuckles\"&gt;honeysuckles&lt;/a&gt; alternated with stylized &lt;a href=\"palmette\"&gt;palmette&lt;/a&gt;s and small &lt;a href=\"rosette%20%28design%29\"&gt;rosettes&lt;/a&gt;. A similar kind of capital can be seen at the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Sankassa\"&gt;Sankassa&lt;/a&gt; elephant capital. A similar frieze is also visible on the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20throne\"&gt;Diamond throne&lt;/a&gt; built by Ashoka at &lt;a href=\"Bodh%20Gaya\"&gt;Bodh Gaya&lt;/a&gt;. These design likely originated in Greek and Near-Eastern arts.\nThe bull is without inscriptions, presumably because its twin pillar, the Rampurava lion pillar already had them and therefore there was no need to repeat. It is thought that the bull symbol is not related to the bull &lt;a href=\"Nandi%20%28bull%29\"&gt;Nandi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, as Ashoka was quite eclectic in his choice of animals for his pillars anyway: lions, elephants, camels, geese, and horses are known."
