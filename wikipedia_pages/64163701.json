    "text": "Cider Making is a mid 19th-century painting by American artist &lt;a href=\"William%20Sidney%20Mount\"&gt;William Sidney Mount&lt;/a&gt;. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts the making of &lt;a href=\"cider\"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt; at a cider mill in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island\"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt;. Mount's work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nDescription.\n\"Cider Making\" was painted by William Sidney Mount in either 1840 or 1841. The painting can be seen as a political work; Mount, a conservative &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;democrat&lt;/a&gt;, was strongly opposed to the presidency of &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Jackson\"&gt;Andrew Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and his successor &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Van%20Buren\"&gt;Martin Van Buren&lt;/a&gt;, whose political opponent &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Harrison\"&gt;William Henry Harrison&lt;/a&gt; often used rural imagery to criticize the former. Harrison's &lt;a href=\"Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Whig Party&lt;/a&gt; was also commonly associated with cider makers.\nThe cider mill depicted in the painting was located in &lt;a href=\"Setauket%2C%20Long%20Island\"&gt;Setauket, Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, and was in operation until the early 20th century. Mount was paid $250 for the painting."
