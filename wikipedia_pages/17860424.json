    "text": "Domenico Fischietti (1725\u20131810) was an Italian composer.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; and studied at the Conservatory of Sant'Onofrio Porta Capuana under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20Leo\"&gt;Leonardo Leo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Durante\"&gt;Francesco Durante&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis first opera, \"Armindo\", premiered in 1742 at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, though there are doubts about whether he could have started composing at such a young age - it may have been by his father. In 1755 he was in Venice to present \"Lo speziale\" (the apothecary), the first opera with a libretto by &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Goldoni\"&gt;Carlo Goldoni&lt;/a&gt;. He followed this success with \"La ritornata a Londra\" (The Return to London) in 1756, \"Il mercato di Malmantile\" (The Market of Malmantile) in 1758, \"Il signor dottore\" (The Doctor) also in 1758, and \"La fiera di Sinigaglia\" in 1760. These works, all &lt;a href=\"dramma%20giocoso\"&gt;drammi giocosi&lt;/a&gt;, represent Fiscietti's chief claim to fame.\nIn 1764, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; where he was associated with the impresario &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Bustelli\"&gt;Giuseppe Bustelli&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Divadlo%20v%20Kotc%C3%ADch\"&gt;Divadlo v Kotc\u00edch&lt;/a&gt; (German \"Kotzentheater\"). Besides a number of operas, it is known that Fischietti's oratorio \"La morte d'Abel\" was staged in this theater in 1763. In 1766 he became the master of the chapel court and the director of sacred music in Dresden. Here he worked with &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottlieb%20Naumann\"&gt;Johann Gottlieb Naumann&lt;/a&gt;. In 1772, he left Dresden and first travelled to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href=\"Salzburg\"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt; where he became a master of the chapel of the prince-archbishop, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hieronymus%20von%20Colloredo\"&gt;Count Hieronymus von Colloredo&lt;/a&gt;. He died in &lt;a href=\"Salzburg\"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt; in or after 1810.\nReferences.\nSome of the information in this article is taken from the ."
