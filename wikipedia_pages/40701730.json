The series is based on &lt;a href=\"Hasbro\"&gt;Hasbro&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Littlest%20Pet%20Shop\"&gt;Littlest Pet Shop&lt;/a&gt;\" toy line, and features Blythe Baxter (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Ashleigh%20Ball%20%28voice%20actress%29\"&gt;Ashleigh Ball&lt;/a&gt;, with the character based on the &lt;a href=\"Blythe%20%28doll%29\"&gt;doll of the same name&lt;/a&gt;) as the main protagonist, as well as other characters who reside in Downtown City (a city modeled after &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;). Along with Blythe is her father, Roger Baxter (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kopsa\"&gt;Michael Kopsa&lt;/a&gt;), and her employer Mrs. Anna Twombly (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Kathleen%20Barr\"&gt;Kathleen Barr&lt;/a&gt;) at the nearby &lt;a href=\"pet%20store\"&gt;pet store&lt;/a&gt;, Littlest Pet Shop. Away from home, she maintains several friends at her local high school. As well as the human cast are her seven animal companions, who reside within Littlest Pet Shop during the day, that Blythe unexpectedly gains the ability communicate with.\nProtagonists.\nBlythe Baxter.\nBlythe is the central character of the series and is an aspiring fashion artist and designer. She is very kind and compassionate and is always ready to assist others in need, whether it be the pets, Mrs. Twombly or her new friends Youngmee, Sue and Jasper or maybe Whittany and Brittany Biskit. She has chestnut hair and light blue eyes and is always wearing fashionable, unique outfits. Blythe, along with her father, Roger Baxter, moves to a flat in Downtown City above a pet store named \"Littlest Pet Shop\". Soon after moving into the building, Blythe hits her head and discovers that she now has the ability to talk and to understand animals. She comes to enjoy working at the Littlest Pet Shop not long after she saves the store from going out of business. Although she has wanted to be on TV all her life, she is also extremely camera shy. She is also little closer to YoungMee, her best friend. Blythe's mother was Lauren Smith (nicknamed \"Betty\") prior to adopting the surname Baxter upon marrying Roger, and Lauren's former pet tortoise Speedy Shellberg claims that Betty also had the ability to talk to animals, a fact that was confirmed by her father in the series' finale. Throughout the series, several jokes were made at the expanse of Blyt\nRussell Ferguson.\nRussell is a male orange &lt;a href=\"European%20hedgehog\"&gt;European hedgehog&lt;/a&gt; with yellow-green eyes. He is the organiser of the group with a love of food. Though uptight, he maintains everyone in the shop, making sure everything's orderly. Though Russell heavily wishes to fit in more with his friends, unfortunately, his love for safety and maintenance and friendship of six friends often spoils the other pets' enjoyment, which causes them to poke fun at him. A running gag is that he is often mistaken for a &lt;a href=\"porcupine\"&gt;porcupine&lt;/a&gt;. In the Season 1 episode \"Penny for Your Laughs\" it is revealed that he has an abnormal fear of marshmallows. He also has a fear of ghosts.\nSunil Nevla.\nSunil is a male blue &lt;a href=\"banded%20mongoose\"&gt;banded mongoose&lt;/a&gt; with golden eyes and an &lt;a href=\"Indian%20people\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; accent.

He is a magician, who enjoys performing various magic tricks to his friends at the shop. Most of them fail or rarely work when he needs it to. Despite his timid appearance and personality, Sunil becomes aggressive at the thought of &lt;a href=\"cobras\"&gt;cobras&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"mongoose%23Diet\"&gt;allusion to mongooses&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Predation\"&gt;natural prey&lt;/a&gt;).

Though slow at times, he is a talented dancer. Unfortunately, he is prone to wreaking havoc for others in the pet shop because of his natural clumsiness.
