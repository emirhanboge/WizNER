    "text": "Mars Hill Audio is a &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Publishing\"&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Charlottesville, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, primarily of &lt;a href=\"Sound\"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; materials, most notably a bimonthly \"audio magazine,\" the \"Mars Hill Audio Journal\". According to the company's website, the purpose of the company is \"to assist Christians who desire to move from thoughtless &lt;a href=\"Consumerism\"&gt;consumption&lt;/a&gt; of modern culture to a vantage point of thoughtful engagement.\"\nMost of the published materials focus on critiques of &lt;a href=\"postmodernity\"&gt;postmodernity&lt;/a&gt; and modern &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; values, and how an &lt;a href=\"orthodoxy\"&gt;orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Christian &lt;a href=\"worldview\"&gt;worldview&lt;/a&gt; applies to a wide range of modern issues such as &lt;a href=\"bioethics\"&gt;bioethics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"city%20planning\"&gt;city planning&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20media\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"academics\"&gt;academics&lt;/a&gt;. However, the viewpoints expressed in the \"Journal\" and other materials are not necessarily politically &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, although the leaning is often in this direction; more accurately, the focus is critical rethinking of many of the assumptions of &lt;a href=\"modernity\"&gt;modernity&lt;/a&gt; and modern &lt;a href=\"Ethics\"&gt;ethical&lt;/a&gt; theory.\nPublications.\nThe \"Mars Hill Audio Journal\", produced regularly since 1993, is a bimonthly, 90-minute \"audio magazine\" available on &lt;a href=\"cassette%20tape\"&gt;cassette tape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CD\"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MP3\"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; and is sold by subscription. Hosted by Ken Myers (formerly with &lt;a href=\"National%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; and a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Theological%20Seminary\"&gt;Westminster Theological Seminary&lt;/a&gt;), the \"Journal\" consists of conversations between Myers and guests, most of whom are authors of recently published books. While a majority of the guests make a Christian profession, guests are selected for the merits of their arguments and the relevance of their viewpoints to the organization's purpose. Myers also provides commentary and analysis to segue from one conversation to the next.\nAlthough the restrictions of the medium limit the length of these conversations to 12 to 15 minutes on the \"Journal\" (with 6 to 8 interviews on each issue), many are available as full-length \"Mars Hill Audio Conversations\" which are sold separately. Common topics include bioethics, city planning and communities, education, &lt;a href=\"natural%20law\"&gt;natural law&lt;/a&gt; theory, &lt;a href=\"relativism\"&gt;relativism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the \"Journal\", Mars Hill Audio also produces anthologies of previously published essays and articles, documentary-type \"Reports\", &lt;a href=\"audiobook\"&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt;s, and a limited amount of printed material."
