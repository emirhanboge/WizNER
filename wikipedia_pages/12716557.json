    "text": "The CAMS 51 was a transport &lt;a href=\"flying%20boat\"&gt;flying boat&lt;/a&gt; built in France in the mid-1920s. Designed as a private venture by &lt;a href=\"Chantiers%20A%C3%A9ro-Maritimes%20de%20la%20Seine\"&gt;Chantiers A\u00e9ro-Maritimes de la Seine&lt;/a&gt; (CAMS), it was a conventional &lt;a href=\"biplane\"&gt;biplane&lt;/a&gt; with two &lt;a href=\"radial%20engine\"&gt;radial engine&lt;/a&gt;s mounted in a tractor-pusher installation in the interplane gap. One example (the 51C) was sold to &lt;a href=\"A%C3%A9ropostale%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;A\u00e9ropostale&lt;/a&gt;, which used it for tests in preparation for &lt;a href=\"Transatlantic%20flight\"&gt;transatlantic&lt;/a&gt; services. CAMS also built a militarised version as the 51R3 in the hopes of interesting the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; in it as a &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, but no order was forthcoming. A final aircraft was built as a record-breaking machine originally designated 51-3\u00a0R that broke the world payload-to-altitude record on 18 August &lt;a href=\"1927%20in%20aviation\"&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt; by lifting 2,000\u00a0kg to 4,684 m (15,368\u00a0ft). This aircraft was later used as a pathfinder for French airmail routes to South America."
