    "text": "Giovanni \"Gianni\" De Biasi (; born 16 June 1956) is an Italian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and former player. He holds dual Italian and Albanian citizenship. De Biasi was the first coach of the &lt;a href=\"Albania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Albania national team&lt;/a&gt; to lead the team to qualify for a major tournament, namely &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202016\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2016&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nDe Biasi was born in &lt;a href=\"Sarmede\"&gt;Sarmede&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Treviso\"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. A &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, he started his professional playing career for &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;; he was part of the first team squad but, despite this, never played for the \"nerazzurri\" and was then loaned to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Reggiana%201919\"&gt;Reggiana&lt;/a&gt; in 1975 and newly promoted &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Pescara%20Calcio\"&gt;Pescara Calcio&lt;/a&gt; one year later. He was sold to &lt;a href=\"Brescia%20Calcio\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 as partial compensation for the signing of &lt;a href=\"Evaristo%20Beccalossi\"&gt;Evaristo Beccalossi&lt;/a&gt; by Inter. De Biasi played in Brescia for five seasons, only one of them in Serie A. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, but abruptly left it three years later following the cancellation of the Sicilian club in the summer of 1986. This was followed by a single season with &lt;a href=\"Vicenza%20Calcio\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt; and two Serie C2 seasons for &lt;a href=\"Treviso%20F.B.C.%201993\"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt;. De Biasi retired from active football in 1990, after a &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt; season with &lt;a href=\"Bassano%20Virtus%2055%20S.T.\"&gt;Bassano&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nClubs in Italy.\nIn 1990, De Biasi became youth team coach for &lt;a href=\"Bassano%20Virtus%2055%20S.T.\"&gt;Bassano&lt;/a&gt;; in 1991, he was appointed by &lt;a href=\"Vicenza%20Calcio\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt; to coach the \"allievi nazionali\" youth squad. In 1992, De Biasi made his debut as first team coach, being boss of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt;2 club &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Pro%20Vasto\"&gt;Vastese&lt;/a&gt; (now Pro Vasto); this was followed by three seasons as &lt;a href=\"Carpi%20F.C.%201909\"&gt;Carpi&lt;/a&gt; boss. In 1996, De Biasi was appointed coach of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Cosenza%20Calcio%201914\"&gt;Cosenza&lt;/a&gt;, but was fired on Christmas' eve day. After a two-year spell at &lt;a href=\"Spal%201907\"&gt;SPAL&lt;/a&gt;, De Biasi was contacted and hired by Serie C1 club &lt;a href=\"Modena%20F.C.\"&gt;Modena&lt;/a&gt; on 2000; with the \"canarini\", De Biasi obtained two consecutive promotions that brought Modena back in Serie A after 38 years. For his achievements with Modena, he was the awarded the \"&lt;a href=\"Panchina%20d%27Oro\"&gt;Silver Bench&lt;/a&gt;\" award in 2002. He left Modena in 2003, after having led his club to safety, achieving an impressive 13th-place finish in the Serie A table, and signed for &lt;a href=\"Brescia%20Calcio\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt;, where he had the opportunity to coach &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Baggio\"&gt;Roberto Baggio&lt;/a&gt; in his last &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Serie%20A\"&gt;playing season of his career&lt;/a&gt;. He was sacked during the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2004\u201305 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, &lt;a href=\"Torino%20F.C.\"&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; appointed De Biasi as head coach, offering him a squad quickly built in a very few days following the cancellation of the old Torino Calcio club and the forming of a new society, owned by &lt;a href=\"Urbano%20Cairo\"&gt;Urbano Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. Under De Biasi, Torino obtained immediate Serie A promotion, after having defeated &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Mantova\"&gt;Mantova&lt;/a&gt; on play-offs. De Biasi, initially confirmed as head coach also for the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2006\u201307 Serie A&lt;/a&gt; campaign, was however sacked three days before the first matchday and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Zaccheroni\"&gt;Alberto Zaccheroni&lt;/a&gt;. On 26 February 2007 Torino FC chairman Cairo decided to sack Zaccheroni too and recall De Biasi at the helm of the \"granata\", leading them to avoid relegation.\nAfter several rumours regarding a possible move to &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Levante%20UD\"&gt;Levante UD&lt;/a&gt;, he was announced on 9 October 2007 to have reached an agreement with the Spanish side, where he will join fellow Italians &lt;a href=\"Damiano%20Tommasi\"&gt;Damiano Tommasi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Rigan%C3%B2\"&gt;Christian Rigan\u00f2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Storari\"&gt;Marco Storari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Cirillo\"&gt;Bruno Cirillo&lt;/a&gt;. He did not manage to save the club from relegation, mainly because of financial struggles which questioned the club's own survival and led to sell several key players during the January transfer window. Despite the lack of top-quality players and as the risk of bankruptcy loomed, he led the team to some unexpected victories, displaying linearity and tactical discipline that gained him the love of the Spanish fans and esteem of the critics: in one of its editions, the popular sports daily \u201cAs\u201d declared him the best coach in the championship\nOn 16 April 2008, he was announced by Torino to replace &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Novellino\"&gt;Walter Novellino&lt;/a&gt; for the five final matchdays, with the aim to save the club from relegation once again. Once again, De Biasi saved the team. On 8 December 2008 he was sacked after fifteen matches, blamed by the team's manager for the fact that Torino was once again struggling to avoid relegation. However, despite hiring and then dismissing a second and then a third coach, the team was still relegated at the end of the championship.\nOn 22 December 2009, &lt;a href=\"Udinese%20Calcio\"&gt;Udinese&lt;/a&gt; dismissed manager &lt;a href=\"Pasquale%20Marino\"&gt;Pasquale Marino&lt;/a&gt; and appointed De Biasi to take charge of the struggling team from North-Eastern Italy. However, results did not particularly improve under his tenure as head coach, and De Biasi himself was removed from his post on 21 February 2010 with Marino being named back at the helm of the club.\nAlbania national team.\nOn 14 December 2011, following &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Ku%C5%BEe\"&gt;Josip Ku\u017ee&lt;/a&gt;'s dismissal, the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Albanian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; announced to have agreed a two-year deal with De Biasi as new head coach of the national team for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;. His first match as Albania manager was a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, during which &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20%C3%87ani\"&gt;Edgar \u00c7ani&lt;/a&gt;, one of his innovations, scored after three minutes for the \"Red and Blacks\".\nIn May 2012, in two friendlies against &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, De Biasi launched new players such as &lt;a href=\"M%C3%ABrgim%20Mavraj\"&gt;M\u00ebrgim Mavraj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%ABrgim%20Brahimi\"&gt;M\u00ebrgim Brahimi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Etrit%20Berisha\"&gt;Etrit Berisha&lt;/a&gt;, whereas in the friendly against Moldova, scheduled on 16 August 2012, he convocated three young players, &lt;a href=\"Erjon%20Dushku\"&gt;Erjon Dushku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erjon%20Vu%C3%A7aj\"&gt;Erjon Vu\u00e7aj&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Renato%20Arapi\"&gt;Renato Arapi&lt;/a&gt;. Albania won narrowly against Iran and Qatar, but was held by Moldova at home.\nDe Biasi won his first competitive match on 7 September 2012, defeating &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 in their opening &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%20E\"&gt;2014 World Cup Qualifying match&lt;/a&gt;, in Tirana, with goals by Sadiku, \u00c7ani and Bogdani. This match saw two newcomers to the Albania's midfield, &lt;a href=\"Alban%20Meha\"&gt;Alban Meha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burim%20Kukeli\"&gt;Burim Kukeli&lt;/a&gt;, who played for the entire match. On 22 March 2013, he led Albania with his schemes and defensive tactical to a 1\u20130 historic win against &lt;a href=\"Norway%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, moving Albania into joint 2nd place in the group 9 points, ahead of Norway who were left on 7 points.\nDe Biasi started &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202016%20qualification\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier&lt;/a&gt; with a 1\u20130 win over group favorites &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. This victory was described as historic by Albanian and international medias, and caused the resignation of Portugal's coach, &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Bento\"&gt;Paulo Bento&lt;/a&gt;. In the next qualifying match against &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; at the newly renovated &lt;a href=\"Elbasan%20Arena\"&gt;Elbasan Arena&lt;/a&gt;, Albania was on lead until 81st minute when &lt;a href=\"Lasse%20Vibe\"&gt;Lasse Vibe&lt;/a&gt; levelled the score to 1\u20131.
