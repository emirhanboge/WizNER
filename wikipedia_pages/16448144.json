    "text": "Coates College for Women was a &lt;a href=\"liberal%20arts\"&gt;liberal arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20college\"&gt;women's college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Terre Haute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. It opened in 1885 and closed in 1897.\nFounding.\n&lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary-of-the-Woods%20College\"&gt;St. Mary-of-the-Woods College&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1840, was originally the only women's college in the Terre Haute area. However, during an industrial boom of the 1860s and 1870s, several new &lt;a href=\"college\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;s, mostly &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20college\"&gt;targeted at male students&lt;/a&gt;, opened in Terre Haute, including &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Indiana State Normal School&lt;/a&gt; in 1865 and the &lt;a href=\"Rose-Hulman%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Rose Polytechnic Institute&lt;/a&gt; in 1874.\nRecognizing that women were also in need of higher education, and also wanting to put a particular emphasis on the teaching of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, Jane B. Coates of &lt;a href=\"Greencastle%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Greencastle&lt;/a&gt; purchased 13 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s in the Strawberry Hill section of Terre Haute and founded the Coates College for Women in 1885. The college opened that October to three students, with Rev. Dr. Laurence G. Hay of &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"president%20%28education%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcademics and culture.\nCoates aimed to be the \"&lt;a href=\"Wellesley%20College\"&gt;Wellesley&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;\" and modeled its &lt;a href=\"curriculum\"&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt; after those of Wellesley and &lt;a href=\"Vassar%20College\"&gt;Vassar College&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, three separate &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;Bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt; programs were offered. The college quickly gained a reputation for attracting excellent students, and many Coates &lt;a href=\"graduates\"&gt;graduates&lt;/a&gt; began to pursue &lt;a href=\"Graduate%20school\"&gt;graduate education&lt;/a&gt; at some of the most esteemed universities in the United States, including the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Coates was &lt;a href=\"nondenominational\"&gt;nondenominational&lt;/a&gt; by design, the college's &lt;a href=\"bylaws\"&gt;bylaws&lt;/a&gt; required at least two-thirds of the &lt;a href=\"trustee\"&gt;trustee&lt;/a&gt;s to be &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt;. It also required that the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; be used as \"the chief &lt;a href=\"textbook\"&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt;\" in classes. All &lt;a href=\"Graduation\"&gt;commencements&lt;/a&gt; were held at local Presbyterian &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28building%29\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt;. A \"religious census\" of Presbyterian colleges in 1897 noted that of the eleven students enrolled, seven were Presbyterian, two were &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt;, one was &lt;a href=\"Baptist\"&gt;Baptist&lt;/a&gt;, and one was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Christ\"&gt;Disciples of Christ&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the College Calendar, the cost for the 1896-97 school year was $300. This included board, &lt;a href=\"tuition\"&gt;tuition&lt;/a&gt;, fuel, light and gymnasium privileges. Music classes were extra.\nGrowth and decline.\n&lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;Enrollment&lt;/a&gt; grew quickly and had surpassed 100 &lt;a href=\"student\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt;s by 1889, even though the college had only three &lt;a href=\"Professor\"&gt;faculty members&lt;/a&gt; at its start. With its rapid growth, the need for more land was recognized. Jane Coates financed more purchasing and construction and also brought in more instructors, including noted &lt;a href=\"sculptor\"&gt;sculptor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Scudder\"&gt;Janet Scudder&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of Jane Coates in 1891, however, the college's main source of &lt;a href=\"funding\"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; became no longer available. Like many other colleges, Coates was severely impacted by the &lt;a href=\"Panic%20of%201893\"&gt;Panic of 1893&lt;/a&gt;. The founder's &lt;a href=\"Will%20%28law%29\"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; became legally disputed by her &lt;a href=\"heir\"&gt;heir&lt;/a&gt;s, making it even more difficult for the college to receive any funding. Enrollment also declined dramatically in the college's final years. As a result, Coates College closed after the conclusion of the 1896 - 1897 &lt;a href=\"academic%20year\"&gt;academic year&lt;/a&gt;."
