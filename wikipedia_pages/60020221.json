    "text": "Freya Ruth Davies (born 27 October 1995) is an English &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er who plays for &lt;a href=\"Sussex%20Women%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20Stars\"&gt;South East Stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London%20Spirit\"&gt;London Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; as a right-arm &lt;a href=\"seam%20bowling\"&gt;fast-medium bowler&lt;/a&gt;. Davies made her Sussex debut in 2010 at the age of fourteen, and played her first match for England in 2019.\nEarly life.\nDavies was born on 27 October 1995 in &lt;a href=\"Chichester\"&gt;Chichester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Sussex\"&gt;West Sussex&lt;/a&gt;. When Davies was a young child, her father, and her older brother Jack, both played for the family's local cricket club, Chichester. At the age of eight, Davies decided to join in, and played her first hard-ball game with Jack's under-11 team. She was attracted to fast bowling, because \"that seemed like the most fun\"; at 10 and 11 she was tall for her age, which also helped. Eventually, she joined the Sussex junior ranks as an 11 year old. \nDavies attended &lt;a href=\"Chichester%20High%20School\"&gt;Chichester High School for Girls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20College\"&gt;Brighton College&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Exeter\"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDomestic career.\nIn 2010, Davies made her county debut for Sussex, against &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20Women%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt;. She took her first wicket a day later in her third match, dismissing the then England captain &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Edwards\"&gt;Charlotte Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to a catch by &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Taylor%20%28cricketer%29\"&gt;Sarah Taylor&lt;/a&gt; that Davies later described as \"unbelievable\". Davies soon became a regular player in Sussex's side, and was part of their team in three title wins: the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Women%27s%20County%20Championship\"&gt;2013 Women's County Championship&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Women%27s%20Twenty20%20Cup\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2015%20Women%27s%20Twenty20%20Cup\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; T20 Cups. In the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Women%27s%20Twenty20%20Cup\"&gt;2019 Women's Twenty20 Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Davies was Sussex's leading wicket-taker, with 8 at an average of 14.62.\nDavies played every game (36) for &lt;a href=\"Western%20Storm\"&gt;Western Storm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Cricket%20Super%20League\"&gt;Women's Cricket Super League&lt;/a&gt; from its inception in 2016 until its conclusion in 2019, helping her side to two titles, in &lt;a href=\"2017%20Women%27s%20Cricket%20Super%20League\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2019%20Women%27s%20Cricket%20Super%20League\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. Davies was the leading wicket-taker in the 2019 competition, with 19 wickets, and the second highest wicket-taker across the four years of the competition, with 37.\nIn October 2019, Davies was named as one of the first two players signed for &lt;a href=\"London%20Spirit\"&gt;London Spirit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Hundred%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;The Hundred&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, Davies played two matches in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Rachael%20Heyhoe%20Flint%20Trophy\"&gt;Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20Stars\"&gt;South East Stars&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to take a wicket.\nInternational career.\nIn February 2019, although uncapped at the time, Davies was one of twenty-one cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board\"&gt;England and Wales Cricket Board&lt;/a&gt; (ECB). Later the same month, she was named in the &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; squad for their tours to &lt;a href=\"English%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20India%20in%202018%E2%80%9319\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20Sri%20Lanka%20in%202018%E2%80%9319\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. She made her &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Twenty20%20International%20cricket\"&gt;Women's Twenty20 International cricket&lt;/a&gt; (WT20I) debut for England against &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20women%27s%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March 2019, and recorded figures of 2/28 from her four overs. She played all three T20Is on the tour, and returned an economy rate of just 4.58.\nThe following month, she made her &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20One%20Day%20International\"&gt;Women's One Day International&lt;/a&gt; (WODI) debut for England, against &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20women%27s%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; on 14 December 2019, and finished with figures of 0/19 from her seven overs. She also played two T20Is on the &lt;a href=\"English%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20against%20Pakistan%20in%20Malaysia%20in%202019%E2%80%9320\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt;, taking three wickets at an average of 14.66.\nDavies played two matches in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Australia%20women%27s%20Tri-Nation%20Series\"&gt;2020 Australia women's Tri-Nation Series&lt;/a&gt;, and was in England's squad for the &lt;a href=\"2020%20ICC%20Women%27s%20T20%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, but did not play a match.\nOn 18 June 2020, Davies was named in a squad of 24 players to begin training ahead of international women's fixtures starting in England following the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. She played one T20I in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202020\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20women%27s%20cricket%20team\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;, taking 1/11 from one over in a rain-reduced 5-over match.\nIn 2021, Davies was named in the squad for England's &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%202020%E2%80%9321\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20women%27s%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Davies played five matches on the tour, and was most successful in the T20 series, where she took her T20I best bowling figures of 4/23 in the second match and ended the series as the joint-leading wicket-taker. In June 2021, Davies was named as in England's &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Test%20cricket\"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt; squad for their one-off match &lt;a href=\"India%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202021\"&gt;against India&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was later released from the squad, allowing her to play in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Rachael%20Heyhoe%20Flint%20Trophy\"&gt;2021 Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy&lt;/a&gt; ahead of England's one-day matches.\nIn December 2021, Davies was named in England's squad for their &lt;a href=\"English%20women%27s%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202021%E2%80%9322\"&gt;tour to Australia&lt;/a&gt; to contest the &lt;a href=\"The%20Women%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;Women's Ashes&lt;/a&gt;."
