    "text": "The Claridge Hi-Tec and its antecedent the Goncz High-Tech Long Pistol are &lt;a href=\"Semi-automatic%20firearm\"&gt;semi-automatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s designed by Hungarian inventor Lajos John Goncz. This unique &lt;a href=\"firearm\"&gt;firearm&lt;/a&gt; features a &lt;a href=\"telescoping%20bolt\"&gt;telescopic bolt design&lt;/a&gt; encased in a tubular upper receiver with a forged &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; frame, &lt;a href=\"rifling\"&gt;button rifled&lt;/a&gt; match &lt;a href=\"gun%20barrel\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;, and 16-round &lt;a href=\"magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt; standard.\nHistory.\nGoncz Armament, Inc. of North Hollywood, CA designed, prototyped, and produced a few hundred High-Tech Long Pistols models GA and GS between 1984 and 1990.\nThe Claridge &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"carbine\"&gt;carbine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;s were based on this design. In 1990, Claridge Hi-Tec, Inc. was created by Joe and Gail Claridge who incorporated Claridge Hi-Tec, Inc. in Northridge, CA. Claridge used this design to produce &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; models S, L, T, ZL-9 and ZT-9, and carbine rifle models C, LEC-9 and ZLEC-9. However, the property rights of the design and rights to produce the weapon came under dispute. In 1993 Claridge Hi-Tec was forced to cease operations due to the Government out lawing the guns in the state of California. No &lt;a href=\"firearms\"&gt;firearms&lt;/a&gt; based on the Goncz design have been produced since then.\nDesign.\nThe lower receiver/frame is a one-piece machined design integral with the &lt;a href=\"pistol%20grip\"&gt;pistol grip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trigger%20guard\"&gt;trigger guard&lt;/a&gt;. It houses all the firing components and the &lt;a href=\"safety%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;safety mechanism&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; is fed through the &lt;a href=\"pistol%20grip\"&gt;pistol grip&lt;/a&gt;. 16-, 20- and 30-round &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt; were made for the weapon, but since 1993 none have been produced. However, re-notched &lt;a href=\"Beretta%2092F\"&gt;Beretta 92F&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt; can be used, and many of those found on the market today are in fact modified &lt;a href=\"Beretta\"&gt;Beretta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Schweizerische%20Industrie%20Gesellschaft\"&gt;SIG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe upper &lt;a href=\"Receiver%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; is a one-piece tube with a screwed in match barrel. Goncz Armament utilized heat treated 4130 solid &lt;a href=\"Chromium\"&gt;chrome&lt;/a&gt; alloy for the &lt;a href=\"Receiver%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; tube. On the Goncz GA and Claridge T and L models, and all &lt;a href=\"rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;s, it also acts as a &lt;a href=\"barrel%20shroud\"&gt;barrel shroud&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Receiver%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; tube houses the &lt;a href=\"bolt%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt;, guide rods and guide springs. All Claridge Hi-Tec and Goncz Armament firearms utilize match barrels manufactured in-house that are &lt;a href=\"rifling\"&gt;button-rifled&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Goncz bolt structure is a clone of the &lt;a href=\"Sa_vz._23\"&gt;SA-VZ23&lt;/a&gt; sub-machinegun. This design utilizes a &lt;a href=\"blowback%20%28arms%29\"&gt;blowback-operated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"telescoping%20bolt\"&gt;telescopic bolt system&lt;/a&gt; housed in the upper receiver tube. \nThe &lt;a href=\"bolt%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt; travels on a &lt;a href=\"firing%20pin\"&gt;firing rod&lt;/a&gt; which protrudes through the &lt;a href=\"bolt%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt;, left of center, next to the &lt;a href=\"firing%20pin\"&gt;firing pin&lt;/a&gt;, and a guide rod located at the top of the bolt. Both rods and their corresponding springs are attached to the spring holder base plate. A &lt;a href=\"recoil%20buffer\"&gt;recoil buffer&lt;/a&gt; sits on the base plate to prevent damage to the bolt when cycling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"firing%20pin\"&gt;firing pin&lt;/a&gt; is a totally unique design. It is attached to a striker plate that travels in a channel on the left side of the &lt;a href=\"bolt%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt; when cycling. This design ensures the &lt;a href=\"firing%20pin\"&gt;firing pin&lt;/a&gt; remains exceptionally sturdy compared with other designs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"iron%20sights\"&gt;iron sights&lt;/a&gt; consist of a square notch in the rear, and a vertical hooded post in the front. There are no &lt;a href=\"picatinny%20rail\"&gt;accessory rails&lt;/a&gt; and no adapters have been produced for the use of a &lt;a href=\"rifle%20scope\"&gt;scope&lt;/a&gt; or other aiming devices.\nOperation.\nThe Goncz action cycles as a closed-bolt mechanism. The user operates the bolt with a knob on the upper-left side of the gun similar to a Tec-9. When Claridge Hi-Tec began production they modified the Goncz design by adding a bolt hold-open button on the left side of the frame. None of the guns produced by Goncz Arms had this feature. However, this is only for inspection as the bolt cannot travel forward from this position with a &lt;a href=\"magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; inserted. The user must insert the &lt;a href=\"magazine%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"bolt%20%28firearm%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt; closed and cock the gun in order to &lt;a href=\"chamber%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;round&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nClaridge produced five models of the Hi-Tec pistols and three models of the Hi-Tec rifles:\nPistols.\nS9 - Similar to the Goncz Armament GS-9, with the exception of the bolt hold open; there was no bolt hold open on any Goncz Armament model. A model marketed as a \"sub-compact\" (although this is misleading as it is far from being subcompact) with a 5\" threaded barrel capable of receiving various attachments. These include a threaded barrel protector, a smooth 3\" barrel extension, a ribbed 3\" barrel extension, and a &lt;a href=\"barrel%20shroud\"&gt;shrouded extension&lt;/a&gt;. Ostensibly, a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;silencer&lt;/a&gt; could also be attached, but there are none available for the thread type.\nS45 - Same design as the S9 chambered in .45 caliber.\nT9/L9 - Similar to the Goncz Armament GA-9, these 9\u00a0mm target/long models utilized a 9.5\" &lt;a href=\"barrel%20shroud\"&gt;shrouded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rifling\"&gt;button rifled&lt;/a&gt; match barrel. These pistols are highly accurate, therefore \"target model\" is apt in this case. These pistols came either all blued or with a blued upper and silver frame.\nT45/L45 - Same design as the T9/L9 except chambered in .45 caliber.\nZL-9 - Unknown.\nZT-9 - Unknown.\nRifles.\nAll Hi-Tec rifles were semi-automatic carbines with 16\" shrouded button rifled match barrels.\nC9 - Walnut stock and forend chambered in 9\u00a0mm.\nC45 - Walnut stock and forend chambered in .45 caliber.\nLEC9 - Black synthetic stock and forend chambered in 9\u00a0mm.\nLEC45 - Black synthetic stock and forend chambered in .45 caliber.\nZLEC9 - Unknown.\nGoncz Armament Models.\nThe Goncz Hi-Tech Models were introduced in 1984 in the following Models:\nGS - Goncz Special: GS-9 (9\u00a0mm), GS-4 (.45 ACP) and GS-3 (.30) Mauser with 5.5\u00a0inch threaded barrel is able to accept &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;silencers&lt;/a&gt; with a 3/4 - 13 thread; also will accept a barrel extension or a &lt;a href=\"picatinny%20rail\"&gt;thread protector&lt;/a&gt;.\nGA - Goncz Assault Pistol GA-9 (9\u00a0mm), GA-4 (.45 ACP) and GA- 3 (.30) Mauser has a longer barrel at 9.5\u00a0inches and a &lt;a href=\"barrel%20shroud\"&gt;barrel shroud&lt;/a&gt; for looks and &lt;a href=\"heat%20sink\"&gt;heatsinking&lt;/a&gt;.\nGC - Goncz &lt;a href=\"Carbine\"&gt;Carbine&lt;/a&gt; GC-9 (9\u00a0mm) with walnut forearm.\nGCL - Goncz &lt;a href=\"Carbine\"&gt;Carbine&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Laser%20applications\"&gt;Laser&lt;/a&gt; GCL-9 (9\u00a0mm) has the Laser as an integral part of the gun.\nGCLight - Goncz &lt;a href=\"Carbine\"&gt;Carbine&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; GCLight-9 (9\u00a0mm), and the light is integral part of the gun frame."
