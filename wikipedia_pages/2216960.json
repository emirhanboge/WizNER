    "text": "Walter Jones Jr. (born January 19, 1974) is an American former professional &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who was an &lt;a href=\"offensive%20tackle\"&gt;offensive tackle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) for 13 seasons. Born in &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, he played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State Seminoles&lt;/a&gt;.\nJones played his entire professional career with the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Seahawks\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a seven-time &lt;a href=\"All-Pro\"&gt;All-Pro&lt;/a&gt; selection and eventual &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%202000s%20All-Decade%20Team\"&gt;NFL 2000s All-Decade Team&lt;/a&gt; honoree. Starting in each of his 180 games in Seattle, the Seahawks attempted more than 5,500 passes with Jones on the field, while Jones gave up a total of only 23 &lt;a href=\"quarterback%20sack\"&gt;quarterback sack&lt;/a&gt;s, and was penalized for holding just nine times. On February 1, 2014, Jones was selected to the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in his first year of eligibility. His son, Walterious Jones, played almost one full season at &lt;a href=\"Dakota%20State%20University\"&gt;Dakota State University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Madison%2C%20South%20Dakota\"&gt;Madison, South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nCollege career.\nJones attended &lt;a href=\"Holmes%20Community%20College\"&gt;Holmes Community College&lt;/a&gt; for two seasons, where he was named Mississippi Junior College Player of the Year by the \"&lt;a href=\"Jackson%20Clarion-Ledger\"&gt;Jackson Clarion-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1994. Then 6\u20325\u2033 () and , Jones played both offensive tackle and tight end. He allowed one sack in two seasons.\nAfter transferring to &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20University\"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;, Jones played for coach &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bowden\"&gt;Bobby Bowden&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Seminoles&lt;/a&gt; teams in 1995 and 1996. He had to &lt;a href=\"Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29\"&gt;redshirt&lt;/a&gt; the 1995 season. As a junior in &lt;a href=\"1996%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, Jones started 11 games and the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; for the Seminoles and allowed one sack, subsequently earning second-team All-&lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;ACC&lt;/a&gt; honors. He decided to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the &lt;a href=\"1997%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1997 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional career.\nJones was drafted by the Seahawks sixth overall in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1997 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. He started every game in which he played, beginning with his rookie season. Jones was a member of the 2005 Seahawks team that lost &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XL\"&gt;Super Bowl XL&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, Jones topped the list of the 101 best NFL players by the Sporting News.\nJones was a nine-time &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; selection and seven-time &lt;a href=\"All-Pro\"&gt;All-Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Jones was perhaps the best at his position in the NFL during the early part of the decade, exemplified by being voted to the NFL's 2000s All-Decade Team. From 1998 through 2000, he helped &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Watters\"&gt;Ricky Watters&lt;/a&gt; achieve three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons for the Seahawks and, later, paved the way for &lt;a href=\"Shaun%20Alexander\"&gt;Shaun Alexander&lt;/a&gt;'s NFL record-setting success.\nJones was recognized by &lt;a href=\"John%20Madden\"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt; as the best player in the NFL in 2004 in a broadcast. Madden recognized Jones in numerous broadcasts as the best left tackle in the NFL and possibly one of the best of all time.\nSeahawks coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Holmgren\"&gt;Mike Holmgren&lt;/a&gt; has called Jones the best offensive player he had ever coached.\nOn Thanksgiving 2008, Jones succumbed to a knee injury playing against the Cowboys in his 180th and final game. The injury required microfracture surgery to repair and immediately ended his season. Jones tried to play again in 2009 but was unsuccessful. On October 28, 2009, Jones was placed on injured reserve by the Seahawks. In a press conference the same day, Jones stated his intention to play in 2010. On April 29, 2010, Jones announced on his Twitter account that he would retire.\nThe Seahawks announced the retirement of his number, 71, and governor &lt;a href=\"Christine%20Gregoire\"&gt;Christine Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; declared April 30 to be \"Walter Jones Day\" in the state of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn December 5, 2010, in a game versus the Carolina Panthers, in front of a crowd of over 66,000, the Seahawks honored the career of Jones by retiring his #71 jersey. This was only the second player number (#80 &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Largent\"&gt;Steve Largent&lt;/a&gt; was the first) to be retired by the Seahawks (they have also retired #12 in honor of the &lt;a href=\"12th%20man%20%28football%29\"&gt;fans&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn January 8, 2011, Jones lifted the 12th Man flag at Qwest Field before the Seahawks' wild card matchup against the &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20Saints\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;. The 7\u20139 Seahawks went on to defeat the defending Super Bowl champion Saints 41\u201336.\nOn February 2, 2014, Jones served as the Seahawks' honorary captain at &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLVIII&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"MetLife%20Stadium\"&gt;MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;East Rutherford, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, prior to their 43-8 victory over the Broncos. This coincided with his election onto the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also helped former &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; and fellow Hall of Famer &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Strahan\"&gt;Michael Strahan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coin%20flipping\"&gt;toss the coin&lt;/a&gt; to end the pregame ceremonies."
