    "text": "The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE SA) is an operating unit within &lt;a href=\"IEEE\"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; that develops global &lt;a href=\"technical%20standard\"&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; in a broad range of industries, including: &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Energy%20development\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artificial_intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"internet%20of%20things\"&gt;internet of things&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20Consumer%20Electronics%20Society\"&gt;consumer technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"consumer%20electronics\"&gt;consumer electronics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medical%20research\"&gt;biomedical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"health%20care\"&gt;health care&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Educational_technology\"&gt;learning technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"information%20technology\"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"robotics\"&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"telecommunication\"&gt;telecommunication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"home%20automation\"&gt;home automation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Automotive_industry\"&gt;automotive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"home%20automation\"&gt;home automation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nanotechnology\"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"information%20assurance\"&gt;information assurance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerging%20technologies\"&gt;emerging technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and many more.\nIEEE SA has developed standards for over a century, through a program that offers balance, openness, &lt;a href=\"fair%20procedure\"&gt;fair procedure&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"consensus\"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt;. Technical experts from all over the world participate in the development of &lt;a href=\"IEEE\"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; standards.\nIEEE SA provides a neutral platform that unites communities for standards development and technological innovation and is independent of any government oversight. IEEE SA develops standards that are consensus-based and has two types of standards development participation models. These are individual and entity.\nIEEE SA is not a body formally authorized by any government, but rather a community. &lt;a href=\"International_Organization_for_Standardization\"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission\"&gt;IEC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"International_Telecommunication_Union\"&gt;ITU&lt;/a&gt; are recognized international standards organizations. ISO members are national standards bodies such as American &lt;a href=\"American%20National%20Standards%20Institute\"&gt;ANSI&lt;/a&gt;, German &lt;a href=\"Deutsches%20Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Normung\"&gt;DIN&lt;/a&gt; or Japanese &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Industrial%20Standards%20Committee\"&gt;JISC&lt;/a&gt;. IEC members are so called National Committees, some of which are hosted by national standards bodies. These are not identical to ISO members. Both IEC and ISO develop International Standards that are consensus-based and follow the \"one country one vote principle\", representing broad industry needs. Their standards cannot be sponsored by individual companies or organizations.\nThe 2021-2022 IEEE SA President is Jim Matthews. Jim has been active in IEEE for over 28 years. He belongs to the IEEE SA, &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20Communications%20Society\"&gt;IEEE Communications Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20Photonics%20Society\"&gt;IEEE Photonics Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IEEE_Power_%2526_Energy_Society\"&gt;IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society&lt;/a&gt;, and the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society. Jim has also been a member of the ANSI Board since 2001, IEC Vice-President and SMB Chair, and was an ITU-T Rapporteur for over 10 years. Previous Presidents of the IEEE SA include Robert S. Fish (2019-2020), F. Don Wright (2017-2018), Bruce Kraemer (2015-2016, and Karen Bartleson (2013-2014).\nThe 2021 Chair of IEEE SA Standards Board (SASB) is Gary Hoffman. Previous SASB chairs include J.P Faure and John Kulick.\nIn March 2020, IEEE Standards Association Open - SA Open, (for open source software) announced Silone Bonewald as its new Executive Director.\nMembership.\nIEEE SA has two membership options that enable enhanced participation in IEEE SA activities, standards development, and governance. These are:\nAt IEEE SA, participation is open to everyone. However, IEEE SA Individual or Corporate Members benefit from enhanced participation privileges.\nIEEE SA Members enjoy added benefits, including but not limited to the ability to hold working group positions, vote on standards, assume leadership positions in standards working groups and activities, and participate in elections for IEEE SA governing bodies. \nThe IEEE has various related programs in addition to standards development, including Industry Connections, Registries, Conformity Assessment, Alliance Management Services, and IEEE SA Open (for open source).\nStandards.\nThe standardization process.\nEach year, the IEEE SA conducts over 200 standards ballots, a process by which proposed standards are voted upon for technical reliability and soundness. In 2020, IEEE had over 1,200 active standards, with over 650 standards under development.\nOne of the more notable are the &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20802\"&gt;IEEE 802&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LAN\"&gt;LAN&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area%20network\"&gt;MAN&lt;/a&gt; group of standards, with the widely used computer networking standards for both wired (&lt;a href=\"ethernet\"&gt;ethernet&lt;/a&gt;, aka IEEE 802.3) and wireless (&lt;a href=\"IEEE%20802.11\"&gt;IEEE 802.11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20802.16\"&gt;IEEE 802.16&lt;/a&gt;) networks, &lt;a href=\"IEEE%201547\"&gt;IEEE 1547&lt;/a&gt; Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems, and &lt;a href=\"ISO/IEEE%2011073\"&gt;ISO/IEEE 11073&lt;/a&gt; Standards for Health Informatics.\nThe IEEE standards development process can be broken down into six basic steps:\nIEEE SA supports the development, production, and distribution of standards by:\nThe patent policy.\nBecause the IEEE's standards often incorporate technologies that are covered by one or more patent claims, the IEEE SA has developed and added to its governing bylaws a patent policy to ensure both that the implementers using the standard-essential patented technology in their standard-compliant products have access to that technology and that the patent holders that voluntarily contribute those technologies to the standard receive adequate compensation for the implementers' use. An important part of the IEEE patent policy is the FRAND commitment, which is a voluntary contractual commitment signifying that a patent holder with patented technology that has been adopted into one of the IEEE's standards will accept as adequate compensation a &lt;a href=\"reasonable%20and%20non-discriminatory%20licensing\"&gt;fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory royalty&lt;/a&gt; for third-party use of that technology. Most standard-setting organizations have developed similar patent policies with similar commitments.\nIn 2014, the IEEE SA became the center of a large academic debate among economic and legal scholars when it appointed an ad hoc committee to recommend and subsequently draft amendments to the IEEE patent policy, to which the IEEE Board of Governors gave final approval in February 2015 and which went into effect in March 2015. The IEEE said that the reason for the amendments was to increase the clarity of the patent policy and the obligations that the patent policy's FRAND commitment imposes on patent holders seeking to enforce their standard-essential patents. One particularly controversial amendment was a provision that prohibited patent holders from seeking injunctions and exclusion orders (from the ITC) against infringers of standard-essential patents.\nThe Antitrust Division stated its support for the 2015 patent policy revisions in a business review letter that it issued in January 2015, upon request from the IEEE SA. In the letter, the Antitrust Division said that the provisions would unambiguously produce net benefits for consumers with insignificant anticompetitive implications. At least one commentator has criticized the Antitrust Division's legal and economic analysis put forth in its business review letter of the revisions, claiming that the Antitrust Division exaggerated the patent policy's procompetitive benefits and wrongly dismissed as unlikely some of its potential anticompetitive costs.\nThe IEEE Get Program.\nThe \"IEEE Get Program\" makes some standards publicly available for download: \"This program grants public access to view and download current individual standards at zero charges.\" On July 11, 2017, the \"IEEE Get Program\" moved to the &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20Xplore\"&gt;IEEE Xplore&lt;/a&gt; digital library website and standards eligible for the program past that date will only be made available there. On September 1, 2017, the original website was decommissioned and remains, without further updates, to redirect visitors.\nBoards and committees.\nA member-elected IEEE SA Board of Governors (BOG) directs the activities of the IEEE SA to establish and maintain policy, provide financial oversight and conduct standards-related activities within IEEE technological fields. It also establishes and oversees boards and committees to carry out the work of the IEEE SA. These boards and committees include:\nThe IEEE SA BOG has eight Strategic Management and Delivery Committees to address strategic focus areas that are necessary and critical for the IEEE SA to achieve long-term organizational objectives. These are:\nAwards.\nThe IEEE SA recognizes outstanding standards development participation through various &lt;a href=\"http%3A//standards.ieee.org/develop/awards/index.html\"&gt;award categories&lt;/a&gt;."
