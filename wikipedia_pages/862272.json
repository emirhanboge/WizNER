    "text": "The Newsroom is a &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; television &lt;a href=\"comedy-drama\"&gt;comedy-drama&lt;/a&gt; series which ran on &lt;a href=\"CBC%20Television\"&gt;CBC Television&lt;/a&gt; in the 1996\u201397, 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305 seasons. A two-hour television movie, Escape from the Newsroom, was broadcast in 2002.\nThe show is set in the &lt;a href=\"newsroom\"&gt;newsroom&lt;/a&gt; of a television station which is never officially named, but is generally understood to be based on CBC's own Toronto affiliate &lt;a href=\"CBLT-DT\"&gt;CBLT&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by American series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Larry%20Sanders%20Show\"&gt;The Larry Sanders Show&lt;/a&gt;\" and similar to such earlier series as the British \"&lt;a href=\"Drop%20the%20Dead%20Donkey\"&gt;Drop the Dead Donkey&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Australian \"&lt;a href=\"Frontline%20%28Australian%20television%20series%29\"&gt;Frontline&lt;/a&gt;\", the series mined a dark vein of comedy from the political machinations and the sheer incompetence of the people involved in producing the fictional \"City Hour\", the station's nightly newscast.\nHistory.\nSeason 1.\n\"The Newsroom\" was not originally intended to be an ongoing series. Its first season of thirteen episodes, broadcast in 1996\u201397, led to critical acclaim but no immediate follow-up commissioning. Following the end of \"The Newsroom\", creator &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Finkleman\"&gt;Ken Finkleman&lt;/a&gt; produced three different short-run series for the CBC, \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Tears\"&gt;More Tears&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Foolish%20Heart%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Foolish Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Objects%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Foreign Objects&lt;/a&gt;\", all of which included George Findlay, the central character of \"The Newsroom\", as a linking character. A Findlay-like character with a different surname had also appeared in Finkleman's pre-\"Newsroom\" series \"&lt;a href=\"Married%20Life%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Married Life&lt;/a&gt;\". Findlay was also revived in the later &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Canada\"&gt;HBO Canada&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Dog\"&gt;Good Dog&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20God%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Good God&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSeason 2.\nAs none of the subsequent series after the initial season of \"The Newsroom\" were as well received by the public or by critics as the original show, the CBC began to seek a new set of \"Newsroom\" episodes. \"Escape from the Newsroom\", which included a &lt;a href=\"fourth%20wall\"&gt;fourth wall&lt;/a&gt;-breaking plot digression in which the characters directly addressed the idea of reviving the series, was meant partly as a sarcastic response to that request. However, Finkleman ultimately agreed to produce 13 new episodes, which were broadcast after a six-year hiatus since the initial series, in the winter of 2004. The last four episodes of the second season were shot as a &lt;a href=\"mockumentary\"&gt;mockumentary&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 3.\nA third season of \"The Newsroom\", consisting of six episodes, was broadcast on CBC beginning on February 14, 2005.\nIn the United States, \"The Newsroom\" aired on &lt;a href=\"PBS\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; stations. All three seasons and \"Escape from the Newsroom\" are available on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowup.\nThe series drew some renewed media attention in 2011, when &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Sorkin\"&gt;Aaron Sorkin&lt;/a&gt; announced that his new 2012 series, set in the newsroom of a &lt;a href=\"cable%20news\"&gt;cable news&lt;/a&gt; channel and originally to be titled \"More As This Story Develops\", would be renamed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Newsroom%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;\". Writing in \"&lt;a href=\"Maclean%27s\"&gt;Maclean's&lt;/a&gt;\", Jaime Weinman said the choice of name was \"a bit of a grimly amusing reminder that the U.S. TV industry doesn't take Canada very seriously\u00a0... 'The Newsroom' is often considered the greatest show Canada has ever produced, but a U.S. network feels no need to fear unflattering comparisons: assuming they\u2019ve heard of the show, they probably think most people in the States have not heard of it.\" In an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Beast\"&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;\" following the Sorkin show's premiere, Finkleman revealed that HBO did contact him for permission to reuse the title, which he granted as he had no further plans to revive his series.\nCharacters.\nMain characters.\nAlthough the series had a large and variable &lt;a href=\"ensemble%20cast\"&gt;ensemble cast&lt;/a&gt;, only three major characters were present throughout the show's entire run.\nGeorge Findlay (series creator &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Finkleman\"&gt;Ken Finkleman&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"executive%20producer\"&gt;executive producer&lt;/a&gt; of \"City Hour\", is a venal, petty man who cares only about his sex life, his lunch orders and his personal image within the &lt;a href=\"Television%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"bureaucracy\"&gt;bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;. Although exceptionally intelligent, he is highly self-absorbed and utterly unconcerned about anything besides himself.\nIn the third-season episode \"One Dumb Idea\", Karen offers her idea on a character based on Findlay for a &lt;a href=\"sitcom\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; idea he was trying to come up with, saying, \"I think if you're gonna go for reality, or, sorry, for \"&lt;a href=\"verisimilitude\"&gt;verisimilitude&lt;/a&gt;\", I think your character should be deceitful and self-serving. Basically, pathologically ambitious and actually lacking in any real humanity.\" In other words, a sociopath.\nFindlay apparently suffers from &lt;a href=\"constipation\"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, hinted at by his obsession with bran muffins, fibre products and doctor appointments for procedures including a &lt;a href=\"colonoscopy\"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe constantly avoids talking to his mother (&lt;a href=\"Clare%20Coulter\"&gt;Clare Coulter&lt;/a&gt;) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her he is in a meeting or on vacation, he even went so far as to have an &lt;a href=\"intern\"&gt;intern&lt;/a&gt; get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, \"Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, \"she\" could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no one to talk to.\" Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; dealer, often calling him about small problems with his \"$40,000 German car.\"\nFindlay has also appeared in nearly all of Finkleman's other television series as a linking character, always working as a film or television producer.\nJim Walcott (&lt;a href=\"Peter%20Keleghan\"&gt;Peter Keleghan&lt;/a&gt;) is \"City Hour\" similarly shallow but far less intelligent &lt;a href=\"anchorman\"&gt;anchorman&lt;/a&gt;. Walcott is often told by the others that he is smart, but Findlay always refers to him as an idiot when he is not around. He lives alone with his cat and has been charged with &lt;a href=\"sexual%20harassment\"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; several times, including an incident when he offered sexual favours to an underage girl in return for a ride in a helicopter.\nIn the final episode of the first season, \"The Campaign\", Walcott, along with other staff of the newsroom, go into &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;. Walcott is running as a &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; for the provincial government of &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. He is asked by a reporter from \"&lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Star\"&gt;The Star&lt;/a&gt;\" whether he is in favour of eliminating &lt;a href=\"child%20poverty\"&gt;child poverty&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, to which he responds confusedly, \"this is a provincial election.\"\nDuring a fundraising party he mishears a woman he is talking to about &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;, thinking she said, \"the decision should be between the woman, her doctor and her \"dog\".\" After \"listening to [their] &lt;a href=\"Opinion%20poll\"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Political%20campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; team decides it best for Walcott to be &lt;a href=\"anti-abortion\"&gt;anti-abortion&lt;/a&gt;, and at an anti-abortion rally he falls victim to a &lt;a href=\"slip%20of%20the%20tongue\"&gt;slip of the tongue&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"I believe life begins at masturbation\". Walcott's attempts to garner additional support include making appearances with his ex-wife and a disabled person, both of whom are represented by &lt;a href=\"Casting%20agent\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; demanding more money per appearance.\nDuring a campaign speech, Walcott is shot and ends up in a &lt;a href=\"coma\"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; with a bullet lodged in his brain. While watching the results of the election on the news, the campaign team celebrates its win just as Walcott dies in the hospital bed beside them.\nIn \"Escape from the Newsroom\", Walcott returns to his job as news anchor. His \"death\" was clarified as a two-year coma. Walcott offers &lt;a href=\"Atom%20Egoyan\"&gt;Atom Egoyan&lt;/a&gt; a story idea about \"a news anchor, who's shot in the head, is in a coma for two years, but survives with a bullet lodged in his brain, and then struggles to return to his news desk.\" After Egoyan says to Walcott that he read about the same thing happening to Walcott, Walcott seems surprised and says, \"yeah, there is a parallel there somewhere.\"\nKaren Mitchell (&lt;a href=\"Karen%20Hines\"&gt;Karen Hines&lt;/a&gt;) is a segment producer, and the news department's only real example of intelligence and professionalism. Karen seems to be the only one who takes &lt;a href=\"journalistic%20integrity\"&gt;journalistic integrity&lt;/a&gt; seriously, while the others try to find ways to boost ratings by glamourizing news stories with &lt;a href=\"sensationalism\"&gt;sensationalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nKaren is apt to point out the ignorant &lt;a href=\"prejudices\"&gt;prejudices&lt;/a&gt; of most of the staff, as they, in turn, tease her for not being able to find a date. Findlay suspects her of being a lesbian after she is featured in a &lt;a href=\"feminist\"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt; magazine as one of ten women in the news who make a difference. He \"&lt;a href=\"connect%20the%20dots\"&gt;connects the dots&lt;/a&gt;\" of her different personality traits to arrive at this conclusion, including observations of her not being able to sustain a male-female relationship, the fact that she knows the editor of a women's magazine, and that she is aggressive, argumentative, sure of herself and moralistic. Karen, however, is not a lesbian, as this only illustrates Findlay's way of thinking.\nWhen offering her suggestion on characters profiles for Findlay's sitcom idea, after ridiculing Findlay she went on to describe a character based on herself that should be \"highly intelligent and attractive in an unconventional way, with very strong legs from the years and years of &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; and running that she has had to do to keep her sanity in a toxic psychic environment that is 'the newsroom', and basically far too busy doing her job to get involved in your stupidity or, I'm sorry, your character's stupidity.\"\nSupporting characters.\nEach season had a different supporting cast of newswriters, reporters, producers and network bureaucrats. The 1996 season one cast included &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Hotz\"&gt;Jeremy Hotz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Farrell%20%28comedian%29\"&gt;Mark Farrell&lt;/a&gt; as Findlay's two \"&lt;a href=\"yes%20men\"&gt;yes men&lt;/a&gt;\" segment producers, &lt;a href=\"Tanya%20Allen\"&gt;Tanya Allen&lt;/a&gt; as Audrey the intern, David Huband as Bruce the weatherguy, &lt;a href=\"Julie%20Khaner\"&gt;Julie Khaner&lt;/a&gt; as Findlay's boss Sidney, &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Beatty\"&gt;Nancy Beatty&lt;/a&gt; as Nancy, Findlay's other boss and David Gale as the entertainment reporter.\n&lt;a href=\"Leah%20Pinsent\"&gt;Leah Pinsent&lt;/a&gt; appeared in \"Escape from the Newsroom\" as anchor Diane Gordon, a character she had previously played in Finkleman's \"More Tears\".\nThe 2004 season two cast included &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Watts%20%28comedian%29\"&gt;Matt Watts&lt;/a&gt; as Matt and &lt;a href=\"Jody%20Racicot\"&gt;Jody Racicot&lt;/a&gt; as Alex who replaced Jeremy and Mark as Findlay's \"yes men\" segment producers. &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Douglas Bell&lt;/a&gt; played Allen, a writer, &lt;a href=\"hypochondriac\"&gt;hypochondriac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harvard\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; graduate who often stutters. &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Lewis\"&gt;Holly Lewis&lt;/a&gt; played Claire and &lt;a href=\"Alberta%20Watson\"&gt;Alberta Watson&lt;/a&gt; played Susan. &lt;a href=\"Tom%20McCamus\"&gt;Tom McCamus&lt;/a&gt; also appeared in one of the 2004 episodes as a newswriter who informed Findlay of his own terminal illness, to Findlay's lack of concern; his character died at the end of the episode.\nIn 2005, the season three additions to the cast included &lt;a href=\"Shaughnessy%20Bishop-Stall\"&gt;Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall&lt;/a&gt; as Jason, who replaced Alex as segment producer, &lt;a href=\"Kristin%20Booth\"&gt;Kristin Booth&lt;/a&gt; as Nora and &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Strange\"&gt;Sarah Strange&lt;/a&gt; as Susan Murdoch, Findlay's boss. &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Hotz\"&gt;Jeremy Hotz&lt;/a&gt; returned to the cast for the first episode when Findlay rehired his character and then fired him later that episode.\nGuest stars.\nThe show also included guest appearances by a number of public figures, including &lt;a href=\"David%20Cronenberg\"&gt;David Cronenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Salutin\"&gt;Rick Salutin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Rae\"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Segal\"&gt;Hugh Segal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naomi%20Klein\"&gt;Naomi Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Richler\"&gt;Daniel Richler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Mosca\"&gt;Angelo Mosca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linda%20McQuaig\"&gt;Linda McQuaig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cynthia%20Dale\"&gt;Cynthia Dale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noam%20Chomsky\"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, playing themselves in interviews on the newscast. \"Escape from the Newsroom\" featured &lt;a href=\"Atom%20Egoyan\"&gt;Atom Egoyan&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction notes.\nThe series was produced by Finkleman's long-time collaborator, Peter Meyboom. For several years they ran an independent production company together called 100 Per Cent Films. Other key creative contributors to The Newsroom were cinematographer Joan Hutton whose documentary style added an authentic feel and music composer Sid Robinovitch, an old friend of Finkleman's who wrote the mournful, jazzy closing theme. Another key collaborator was editor &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Novak\"&gt;Allan Novak&lt;/a&gt;, who edited all of Finkleman's early Canadian work including \"Married Life, More Tears, Foolish Heart\", and \"Foreign Objects\". Novak also produced and directed a half hour behind the scenes documentary called Inside the Newsroom. CBC executives green-lighting and overseeing the project included Deborah Bernstein, Susan Morgan, &lt;a href=\"Slawko%20Klymkiw\"&gt;Slawko Klymkiw&lt;/a&gt; and Phyllis Platt.\nAwards and nominations.\n&lt;a href=\"Directors%20Guild%20of%20Canada\"&gt;DGC Craft Award&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Directors%20Guild%20of%20Canada\"&gt;DGC Team Award&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Gemini%20Awards\"&gt;Gemini Awards&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Awards%23International\"&gt;International Emmy Awards&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Rose%20d%27Or\"&gt;Rose d'Or&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;San Francisco International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Writers%20Guild%20of%20Canada\"&gt;WGC Awards&lt;/a&gt;"
