    "text": "The Lutheran Church in Mo\u0161ovce (&lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;) belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Augsburg\"&gt;Augsburg&lt;/a&gt; Denomination of the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Church\"&gt;Lutheran Church&lt;/a&gt; and was built in 1864 \u2013 1871 after the acquisition of religious freedoms in the contemporary &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, allowing &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; parishioners to construct their own &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;. This was done in the place of an original church from 1783, which was smaller and had no tower.\nDescription.\nThe church is a rectangular building, reconstructed in 1927, specific for its simple &lt;a href=\"Classical%20architecture\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; expression and a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; under the tower. The tower with a &lt;a href=\"Clock%20face\"&gt;four-faced&lt;/a&gt; (functional) &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; is terminated with a high &lt;a href=\"roof\"&gt;roof&lt;/a&gt;. From three sides, the interior of the church is lined with a &lt;a href=\"choir\"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;, resting on &lt;a href=\"column\"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;s. The entrance area is adorned by an oil painting of &lt;a href=\"Mo%C5%A1ovce\"&gt;Mo\u0161ovce&lt;/a&gt; from the 19th century and the main &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; hosts a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; depicting the &lt;a href=\"last%20supper\"&gt;last supper&lt;/a&gt;. The church's furnishings include an electrical &lt;a href=\"organ%20%28music%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;, glass chandeliers and an &lt;a href=\"altar\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"pulpit\"&gt;pulpit&lt;/a&gt;. The rear part of the church contains 3 pronouncedly vertically elongated arch painted-glass&lt;a href=\"window\"&gt;window&lt;/a&gt;s depicting &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; motives. Between 1973 \u2013 1975 a general reconstruction of the church was performed, allowing for the exchange of the benches, windows, choirs, as well as the altar and pulpit. Following reconstructions of the outer &lt;a href=\"facade\"&gt;facade&lt;/a&gt; took place at the beginning of the 1990s and thereafter at around 2005. The reason for the relatively frequent reconstructions was the material used for the construction of the church, containing substances constantly penetrating the plaster up to its surface and degrading it strongly. In the past, damage was visible especially during humid weather. After the last reconstruction, the condition of the church seems to be stable.\nBells.\nThe tower's belfry hosts three &lt;a href=\"church%20bell\"&gt;church bell&lt;/a&gt;s of various size. In addition to their basic purpose, calling church-members for &lt;a href=\"service%20of%20worship\"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt;, the bells fulfill yet another function by announcing the death of the town residents according to the following formula:\nOriginally, until the beginning of the 1990s, the bells also announced the time using chimes of the smallest bell:"
