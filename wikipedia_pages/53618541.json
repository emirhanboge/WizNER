    "text": "The Moccasin Bluff Site (also designated 20BE8) is an &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20site\"&gt;archaeological site&lt;/a&gt; located along the Red Bud Trail and the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29\"&gt;St. Joseph River&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Buchanan%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Buchanan, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. It was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1977, and has been classified as a multi-component &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; site with the major component dating to the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; period.\nHistory.\nThe terrace between Moccasin Bluff and the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;St. Joseph River&lt;/a&gt; was home to temporary camps as early as 6300 B.C. Around A.D 500, inhabitants here traded with other groups of &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. By A.D. 1100-1400, more permanent villages were established here, and the residents farmed the local lands.\nBy the late 1820s, European settlers moved into the area to log and farm the land. The US government then adopted a policy of moving the local &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; out of the area and further west. This bluff is said to be named for Cogomoccasin, leader of one of the nearby displaced Potawatomi villages.\nIn 1948, the site was excavated by a &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; team, which found &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"burial\"&gt;burial&lt;/a&gt;s and remnants of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; and storage pits. In 2002, &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; excavated a wetland area at a lower elevation that had not been previously examined.\nDescription.\nThe Moccasin Bluff Site is located on a terrace along Red Bud Trail. The terrace overlooks a wide bend in the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;St. Joseph River&lt;/a&gt; containing a pair of islands. The site is protected by a half-circle of hills to the north, west and south.\nThe site is significant in being one of the few Prehistoric sites in western &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; showing evidence of intensive occupation over a long time period. This has resulted in a rich &lt;a href=\"midden\"&gt;midden&lt;/a&gt; which yields a large quantity of &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. The deposits are not stratified, but the artifacts themselves, supported by &lt;a href=\"radiocarbon%20date\"&gt;radiocarbon date&lt;/a&gt;s and comparison to other sites, are diagnostic of several periods of Native American &lt;a href=\"prehistory\"&gt;prehistory&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from c. 8500 BC to the 1600s A.D. or just prior to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an contact. The &lt;a href=\"Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Archaic&lt;/a&gt; (c. 8500-1500 BC), &lt;a href=\"Early%20Woodland%20Period\"&gt;Early Woodland&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1500-100 BC) and &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Woodland\"&gt;Middle Woodland&lt;/a&gt; (c. 100BC-500 AD) are represented based on the types of artifacts recovered. However, the main occupation was in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland%20period\"&gt;Late Woodland period&lt;/a&gt; (c. 500-1500 AD) with evidence of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1000-1500 AD) occupation and/or influence as well.\nResults of 1948 Excavations.\nThe excavations yielded pit features, &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, animal bone and plant remains.\nFeatures.\nThere were no trace of &lt;a href=\"dwelling\"&gt;dwelling&lt;/a&gt;s found at the site. Nor were there post molds that might have indicated the presence of &lt;a href=\"Building\"&gt;structures&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded that the lack of structural features may be due to the fact that the main part of the site was destroyed during the construction of the Red Bud Trail Highway.\nFour feature types were identified; &lt;a href=\"Storage%20pit%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;storage pits&lt;/a&gt; (62), &lt;a href=\"fire%20pit\"&gt;fire pit&lt;/a&gt;s (17), &lt;a href=\"hearth\"&gt;hearth&lt;/a&gt;s (19) and smudge pits (2). Three &lt;a href=\"burial\"&gt;burial&lt;/a&gt;s were located, of which only one was fully excavated.\nThe fire pits may have functioned as &lt;a href=\"earth%20oven\"&gt;earth oven&lt;/a&gt;s for the roasting of the &lt;a href=\"Nymphaea%20odorata\"&gt;white water lily&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tuber\"&gt;tuber&lt;/a&gt;. No trace of the tubers were found at the site, but in similar pits at the &lt;a href=\"Griesmer%20Site\"&gt;Griesmer site&lt;/a&gt; in northwest &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; the carbonized remains of &lt;a href=\"Nymphaea%20odorata\"&gt;white water lily&lt;/a&gt; tuber were identified; and at the &lt;a href=\"Schwerdt%20Site\"&gt;Schwerdt Site&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Kalamazoo%20River\"&gt;Kalamazoo River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, the carbonized tubers of a similar water-lily species, &lt;a href=\"American%20Lotus\"&gt;American Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, were found in deep roasting pits.\nBoth smudge pits contained the carbonized remains of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;. The contents were analyzed and it was determined to be Eastern Complex &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;. Based on previous ethnographic observation, the researchers concluded the features were used as a smudge to cure hides.\nAnimal Bone.\nThe remains of 32 species were present at Moccasin Bluff. However when the remains were analyzed to assign pounds of meat present of each species, the results were 32% &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, 27% &lt;a href=\"elk\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt;, 8% &lt;a href=\"sturgeon\"&gt;sturgeon&lt;/a&gt;, 6% &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;, 5% &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; and 2% &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;. These bones were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog and bear, possibly the remains of ceremonial activities. Dog sacrifice and &lt;a href=\"dog%20meat\"&gt;dog meat&lt;/a&gt; consumption was observed to have &lt;a href=\"Ceremony\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; implications in early &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; tribes. &lt;a href=\"Bear%20worship\"&gt;Bear worship&lt;/a&gt; and ceremonialism has also been recorded in the &lt;a href=\"Ethnology\"&gt;ethnological&lt;/a&gt; record.\nPlant Remains.\nSpecimens of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"fire%20pit\"&gt;fire pit&lt;/a&gt;s were analyzed and found to be primarily &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hickory\"&gt;hickory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maple\"&gt;maple&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting the makeup of the local &lt;a href=\"deciduous%20forest\"&gt;deciduous forest&lt;/a&gt;. Some carbonized food remains were identified as &lt;a href=\"acorn\"&gt;acorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"walnut\"&gt;walnut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20plum\"&gt;Canadian plum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Butternut%20tree\"&gt;butternut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hickory%20nut\"&gt;hickory nut&lt;/a&gt;. Eastern complex &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; was present in the two smudge pits.\nArtifacts.\nThe following types of &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; were recovered from the site:\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; ceremonial or religious activities; recreational activities; and clothing or personal adornment.\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:\nOccupations and Associated Pottery Types.\nArchaeologists often find pottery to be a very useful tool in analyzing a prehistoric culture. It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Middle%20Woodland\"&gt;Middle Woodland&lt;/a&gt; (c. 100 BC-500 AD).\nA total of 20 vessels of Havana Ware &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; was collected in the 1948 excavations. The Havana Culture was thought to be a local variant of the main &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Woodland\"&gt;Middle Woodland&lt;/a&gt;, which was dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Adena%20culture\"&gt;Adena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hopewell%20culture\"&gt;Hopewell&lt;/a&gt; cultures of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt; Valleys. &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Woodland\"&gt;Middle Woodland&lt;/a&gt; cultures are characterized by their large &lt;a href=\"burial%20mounds\"&gt;burial mounds&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are still visible today; as well as their distinctive &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; forms, &lt;a href=\"ceremonial\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; practices, &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; activities, and widespread &lt;a href=\"trade%20network\"&gt;trade network&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; (c. 500 AD-1500 AD) / &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1000-1500 AD).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; period in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; region was characterized by the introduction of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed for more efficient food production. This led to &lt;a href=\"Population%20growth\"&gt;population increases&lt;/a&gt; which in turn led to increased competition for resources, resulting in more conflict/&lt;a href=\"war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;fare. After 1000 AD, there was increased interaction and influence from the &lt;a href=\"Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; cultures of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Mississippi River Valley&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the formation of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Upper Mississippian culture&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20area\"&gt;Great Lakes area&lt;/a&gt;.\nBased on analysis of the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; collected in the 1948 excavations, 2 distinct types of pottery wares were defined: &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; grit-&lt;a href=\"Temper%20%28pottery%29\"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt; Moccasin Bluff Ware (327 vessels) and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; shell-&lt;a href=\"Temper%20%28pottery%29\"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt; Berrien Ware (48 vessels).\nMoccasin Bluff Ware (327 vessels).\nMoccasin Bluff Ware is divided into several types, some of which have variants, groups and sub-groups:\nBerrien Ware (48 vessels).\nThe shell-&lt;a href=\"Temper%20%28pottery%29\"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt; Berrien Ware present at the site is divided into 5 subgroups based on shoulder, neck, surface finish and rim and lip attributes, and can be typed according to 2 previously recognized &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; cultures:\nProposed Late Prehistoric Chronology.\nThe large quantity of &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; collected at the Moccasin Bluff site, in conjunction with comparisons with other sites, enabled the authors of the site report to propose a chronological history of &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; cultures in the western &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; / northwest &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; region.\nThe Berrien Phase terminates with the end of &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistory&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Historical%20archaeology\"&gt;Historic&lt;/a&gt; period. The authors of the site report hypothesize that Berrien-Huber ware may be associated with the historic &lt;a href=\"Miami%20tribe\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; tribe; the Moccasin Bluff Scalloped with an &lt;a href=\"Algonquian%20languages\"&gt;Algonquian&lt;/a&gt;-speaking tribe such as the &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt;; and the Moccasin Bluff Notched Applique Strip with &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; tribes who may have been displaced during the &lt;a href=\"Iroquois%20Wars\"&gt;Iroquois Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the fact that &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; was traditionally considered the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt;, other researchers have also suggested that the Berrien Phase represents the material culture of the &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; tribe.\nNotably, there are no &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an trade goods present in the Berrien Phase at Moccasin Bluff. Therefore the site was abandoned at or just before the time of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an contact. The same may be said for the Berrien Phase component at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Schwerdt%20Site\"&gt;Schwerdt&lt;/a&gt; site. The reason for this may be that in the &lt;a href=\"Protohistory\"&gt;Protohistoric&lt;/a&gt; or early &lt;a href=\"Historical%20archaeology\"&gt;Historic&lt;/a&gt; period the &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; were displaced from western Michigan as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Iroquois%20Wars\"&gt;Iroquois Wars&lt;/a&gt; and moved to the west shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Island%20II%20Site\"&gt;Rock Island II Site&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Island%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Rock Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29\"&gt;Green Bay&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of a &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; village in this early &lt;a href=\"Historical%20archaeology\"&gt;Historic&lt;/a&gt; period. As a result, the lower peninsula of Michigan became a \"no-mans land\", mostly unoccupied for several decades.\nResults of 2002 Excavations.\nFurther excavations were conducted in 2002 to further clarify questions about the &lt;a href=\"Subsistence%20economy\"&gt;subsistence&lt;/a&gt; patterns and site function. Further examples of Moccasin Bluff Ware were recovered; Moccasin Bluff Plain Modified Lip, Moccasin Bluff Impressed Exterior Lip, Moccasin Bluff Scalloped, Moccasin Bluff &lt;a href=\"Cord-marked%20pottery\"&gt;Cordmarked&lt;/a&gt;, and Moccasin Bluff Plain. In addition, there were vessels recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Woodland\"&gt;Middle Woodland&lt;/a&gt; and also a partially reconstructed vessel from the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Woodland%20Period\"&gt;Early Woodland&lt;/a&gt;, a poorly represented time period in the 1948 excavations.\nThe 2002 excavations used the &lt;a href=\"Flotation%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;flotation&lt;/a&gt; technique to recover small plant remains, a practice that was not used in earlier times. As a result, numerous small seeds and fruit seeds were recovered. Of the fruits, &lt;a href=\"pin%20cherry\"&gt;pin cherry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pokeberry\"&gt;pokeberry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grape\"&gt;grape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blackberry\"&gt;blackberry&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"raspberry\"&gt;raspberry&lt;/a&gt; were present. Of the seeds, several indigenous starchy and oily seed were recovered, including &lt;a href=\"goosefoot\"&gt;goosefoot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"maygrass\"&gt;maygrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"knotweed\"&gt;knotweed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amaranth\"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sumpweed\"&gt;sumpweed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sunflower\"&gt;sunflower&lt;/a&gt;. These seeds are part of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Agricultural%20Complex\"&gt;Eastern Agricultural Complex&lt;/a&gt;, a group of cultivated or semi-cultivated plants utilized by the Prehistoric populations in addition to the better-known crops such as &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bean\"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cucurbita\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;. These types of small seeds are not likely to be recovered unless &lt;a href=\"Flotation%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;flotation&lt;/a&gt; is used, which is why they were underreported and largely unknown until &lt;a href=\"Flotation%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;flotation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28statistics%29\"&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; became widespread among &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeologists&lt;/a&gt;.\nSite function and Berrien Phase settlement patterns.\nThe data recovered from the Moccasin Bluff site shows many indications that the site was occupied for most or all of the year:\nBased on evidence from the excavations, combined with evidence from the early Historic Native American tribes, it was concluded that the Moccasin Bluff site represented a permanent or semi-permanent site, with other sites such as Schwerdt serving as temporary encampments to exploit seasonal resources. There are no structures reported from Moccasin Bluff, but the researchers felt that the part of the site containing the houses was destroyed in the building of a highway through the area.\nThe 2002 excavations found no additional evidence of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; and still no evidence of structures, and some archaeologists are re-thinking the agricultural village interpretation. Since there is a lack of known &lt;a href=\"Late%20Woodland\"&gt;Late Woodland&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian%20culture\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"protohistoric\"&gt;protohistoric&lt;/a&gt; agricultural village sites elsewhere in western &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, some researchers are suggesting that perhaps the subsistence pattern was not heavily focused on maize cultivation as was originally thought. Instead, the adaptation of the Berrien Phase population may have been more balanced between hunting, fishing, gathering and limited cultivation of Eastern Agricultural Complex seeds as well as maize."
