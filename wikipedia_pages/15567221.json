    "text": "Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne (, literally \"Beaulieu on &lt;a href=\"Dordogne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Dordogne&lt;/a&gt;\"; ) is a &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Corr%C3%A8ze\"&gt;Corr\u00e8ze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nouvelle-Aquitaine\"&gt;Nouvelle-Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20France\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, central &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Beaulieu is a medieval city, originally dominated by its great &lt;a href=\"abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt; of St Pierre, of which only the abbey church remains. On 1 January 2019, the former commune &lt;a href=\"Brivezac\"&gt;Brivezac&lt;/a&gt; was merged into Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne.\nGeography.\nToponymy.\nBeaulieu comes from the Latin \"bellus locus\", \"lieu beau\", a nice place to live. The inhabitants of Beaulieu are called by varies names: Beaulieusard, Beaulieurois, Bellilocien, Bellieurain, Bellilocois, Belliloquois, Belliloqueteux, Belliqui\u00e8re, Berlugan, Beloudonien.\nLocation.\nBeaulieu is in the south of the &lt;a href=\"Corr%C3%A8ze\"&gt;Corr\u00e8ze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on the D940 road on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Dordogne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Dordogne river&lt;/a&gt;, south of the &lt;a href=\"Limousin\"&gt;Limousin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tulle\"&gt;Tulle&lt;/a&gt; is 37\u00a0km north. &lt;a href=\"Brive-la-Gaillarde\"&gt;Brive-la-Gaillarde&lt;/a&gt; is 38\u00a0km away and &lt;a href=\"Collonges-la-Rouge\"&gt;Collonges-la-Rouge&lt;/a&gt; is 20\u00a0km to the northwest. &lt;a href=\"Aurillac\"&gt;Aurillac&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cantal\"&gt;Cantal&lt;/a&gt;) is 60\u00a0km to the east.\nHydrography and relief.\nThe commune is limited on its entire eastern border by the Dordogne, and watered to the north by its tributary the M\u00e9noire.\nHistory.\nMiddle ages.\nIn the midst of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20succession\"&gt;War of succession&lt;/a&gt; at the head of Aquitaine, around 855, Rodolphe de Turenne, Archbishop of &lt;a href=\"Bourges\"&gt;Bourges&lt;/a&gt;, rallied to the \"legitimate\" cause embodied by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20the%20Bald\"&gt;Charles the Bald&lt;/a&gt;, was committed to establishing a monastic foundation on his family lands. After a vain attempt at V\u00e9gennes, he turned to Vellinus. The &lt;a href=\"cartulary\"&gt;cartulary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt; reported that at the sight of the place's splendour, he could not help but baptise it \"bellus locus\". From the great &lt;a href=\"Solignac%20Abbey\"&gt;Solignac Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, he invited a team of monks to set up a new monastery and participated with his wide kin in the building of the abbey's heritage. The &lt;a href=\"monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; was consecrated in 860. Like those at nearby &lt;a href=\"Uzerche\"&gt;Uzerche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Limoges\"&gt;Limoges&lt;/a&gt;, the abbey of Saint Pierre at Beaulieu was a &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; foundation and flourished largely because of its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20St.%20James\"&gt;Way of St. James&lt;/a&gt;. The first monks came from the abbey of &lt;a href=\"Solignac\"&gt;Solignac&lt;/a&gt;, near Limoges.\nThanks to the pious donations of the Counts of Quercy, the Viscounts of &lt;a href=\"Turenne%2C%20Corr%C3%A8ze\"&gt;Turenne&lt;/a&gt;, their multiple vassals, the area of the abbey consists of a third of the Bas-Limousin. Endowed with a treasure trove of relics (Saint-Prime and F\u00e9licien), and although it suffered from secular lusts, it had a spectacular rise that allowed the development of pilgrimages. Beaulieu became an essential stage on the roads uniting Limoges to Aurillac and &lt;a href=\"Figeac\"&gt;Figeac&lt;/a&gt;, leading to Conques, Moissac, Toulouse and Compostela. As its wealth grew, the independence of the abbey was threatened by neighbouring &lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; lords and it was defended against their depredations by the bishops of Limoges. Annexed to the &lt;a href=\"Cluny%20Abbey\"&gt;Cluny Abbey&lt;/a&gt; around 1095, it was reformed and experienced a favourable period and the construction of the great abbey church was begun and it continued for nearly half a century. In the fourteenth century, a separate western steeple was erected: this also acted as the town's belfry.\nThe powerful abbey, under the protection of popular saints, was located around fertile lands, an indispensable condition for the village inhabitants to develop. From the end of the 12th century, a village was built around the &lt;a href=\"conventual\"&gt;conventual&lt;/a&gt; buildings protected by a wall, punctuated by towers and bordered by a ditch. From the monastic enclosure, districts developed outside the walls: the \"Faubourg de la Grave\", towards the Dordogne, where the former hospital was located; the main district at the site of the old village of Vellinus; the \"Barri du Trou\" in which the deceased were buried and the Mirabel district near the ancient orchards of the abbey. Beaulieu became an important commercial place from which emerged a true bourgeois community that aroused the desires of the Lords of Castelnau and Turenne.\nFrom 1213, saw the end of the Cluny stranglehold, with the abbey losing power little by little. Beaulieu became the seat of the conflicts for power between the Lord Abbot, the middle-class and the Viscount of Turenne. With the beginning of the fifteenth century, the abbey gradually crumbled.\nModern era.\nThe abbey declined during the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, which devastated the region. The &lt;a href=\"French%20Wars%20of%20Religion\"&gt;French Wars of Religion&lt;/a&gt; completed the process. The abbey suffered the attacks by the Protestants during that war. As the sixteenth century approached, the ideas of the reform had spread under the influence of the merchants and \"gabariers\" (barge-men) of the Dordogne. Twice (1569\u20131574), the Protestants troops of the Admiral &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny\"&gt;Gaspard de Coligny&lt;/a&gt; plundered the city and the abbey. The abbey church was then transformed into a Protestant temple. Given to the Catholic cult, in 1622, thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20League%20%28French%29\"&gt;Catholic League&lt;/a&gt;, the abbey was rebuilt in the seventeenth century by the Benedictine Congregation of Saint-Maur. They reinstate the monastic discipline and it was not until 1663 that the abbey began to function again. The city, again prosperous, erected its opulent mansions. The former Leaguer's created, with the help of the bishops, many brotherhoods.\nFrench Revolution and Empire.\nThe abbey still sheltered six monks when the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the conventual buildings and the &lt;a href=\"Maurist\"&gt;Maurist&lt;/a&gt; constructions. The abbey was spared and became a parish church.\nContemporary period.\nOn January 1, 2019, the municipality extended its perimeter to that of &lt;a href=\"Brivezac\"&gt;Brivezac&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation and society.\nSport.\nBeaulieu's rugby club was created in 1908: \"Union Sportive Beaulieu \"(U.S.B.). A regular champion of the Limousin, the club participated in several stages of the French championship reaching the semifinals in 1921. During the 2011-2012 season, the club was shown by winning the title of Champion of France in 2nd Series by beating in the final, \"US Josbaig Saint Goin\" (15 to 11), crowning a great season and allowing the club to climb in 1st Series for the season 2012-2013.\nEconomy.\nThe Beaulieu region produces 400 tonnes of strawberries or nearly 1% of French production. In particular, it feeds the production of jams by the Andros group in its factories in Biars-Bretenoux. A strawberry festival is held on the second Sunday in May, where a strawberry pie is made of 8 metres diameter and 900\u00a0kg of strawberries.\nLocal culture and heritage.\nCivil buildings.\nCh\u00e2teau d'Estresse.\nThe Chateau was built on a terrace supported by a medieval retaining wall on the Dordogne river, so as to defend Beaulieu and the upper valley from invasions from the river (King &lt;a href=\"Odo%20of%20France\"&gt;Odo of France&lt;/a&gt; stopped the Normans in 889). The Chateau consists of buildings from the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, and one can still see a &lt;a href=\"bret%C3%A8che\"&gt;bret\u00e8che&lt;/a&gt; protruding over the entrance gate. The Chateau approached the twentieth century in the state of ruin, but it was restored. It is included in the inventory of historical monuments.\nReligious buildings.\nAbbey Church of St Pierre.\nFounded in the 9th century by Rodolphe of the family of the Counts of Turenne, Lords of Beaulieu, the abbey was attached to &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Cluny\"&gt;Cluny&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th century. Under the impetus of the &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20Reform\"&gt;Gregorian reforms&lt;/a&gt;, the pilgrimages flourished, necessitating the construction of new, better-adapted churches.\nIn 1150, the &lt;a href=\"Choir%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"transept\"&gt;transept&lt;/a&gt; of the new Church of Beaulieu were already completed. The construction would continue until the 13th century. The plan was similar to the others &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque churches&lt;/a&gt; of the pilgrimages, with a &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Cross\"&gt;Latin Cross&lt;/a&gt;, having a &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"aisle\"&gt;aisle&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"ambulatory\"&gt;ambulatory&lt;/a&gt; allowing pilgrims, to pray to the saints of their choice in the &lt;a href=\"Apse%20chapel\"&gt;apsidal chapel&lt;/a&gt; without disturbing high &lt;a href=\"altar\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt;. The architect &lt;a href=\"Anatole%20de%20Baudot\"&gt;Anatole de Baudot&lt;/a&gt; carried out restoration work.\nThe church has a nave of four spans. The choir, the southern arm of the transept and much of the nave date back to the original &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; phase of the building. The belfry and the central tower are of later, &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; construction. The total length of the building is 71 metres, and the width at the transept is 38 metres. The nave rises to 17 metres, while the central tower exceeds it by 6 metres.\nThe most notable feature of the church is the elaborately sculpted south portal, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Tympanum%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;tympanum&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the usual &lt;a href=\"Last%20Judgement\"&gt;Last Judgement&lt;/a&gt;, this depicts the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Coming\"&gt;Second Coming&lt;/a&gt;, the triumphant return of Christ, and the &lt;a href=\"General%20Resurrection\"&gt;General Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;. A 2.1 metre Christ, his arms spread in the form of a cross, is flanked by the 12 &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;Apostles&lt;/a&gt;, while angels above him carry the crown and nails. Meanwhile, other angels sound the trumpet to summon up the dead.\nAnother notable feature is a fine &lt;a href=\"baroque\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"retable\"&gt;retable&lt;/a&gt; in gilded wood, dating from 1678, shortly after the refounding of the abbey. It depicts the &lt;a href=\"Assumption%20of%20the%20Virgin\"&gt;Assumption of the Virgin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"church%20treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt; contains a number of important high medieval items, including a &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20and%20Child\"&gt;Virgin and Child&lt;/a&gt; and two arm &lt;a href=\"reliquaries\"&gt;reliquaries&lt;/a&gt;, all made of wood and covered in silver or gold leaf.\nCultural heritage.\nIn its 2017 charts, \"le Conseil national des villes et villages fleuris de France\" (National Council of the Flower Towns and Villages of France) awarded a flower to the commune in the \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" (Contest of the Flowers towns and villages).\nPersonalities.\nNotable personalities linked to the commune include:"
