It premiered on &lt;a href=\"Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; on November 8, 2015.\nPlot.\n&lt;a href=\"Carrie%20Mathison\"&gt;Carrie&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Claire%20Danes\"&gt;Claire Danes&lt;/a&gt;) asks Saul (&lt;a href=\"Mandy%20Patinkin\"&gt;Mandy Patinkin&lt;/a&gt;) to fetch copies of the leaked CIA documents, voicing her theory that the Russians are trying to kill her due to something contained in the documents. Saul refuses to help her, but his suspicions are soon aroused when he notices that he is being followed by a surveillance detail. He learns from Allison (&lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Otto\"&gt;Miranda Otto&lt;/a&gt;) that Dar Adal (&lt;a href=\"F.%20Murray%20Abraham\"&gt;F. Murray Abraham&lt;/a&gt;) ordered the surveillance. During a heated argument, Adal accuses Saul of being in league with the Israelis, and proclaims that Saul will be subjected to a &lt;a href=\"polygraph\"&gt;polygraph&lt;/a&gt; test.\nCarrie returns to Jonas (&lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Fehling\"&gt;Alexander Fehling&lt;/a&gt;) at their hideaway, who tells her that Quinn wandered off while severely bleeding and is probably dead. Jonas gives Carrie an ultimatum, telling her it's time to notify the authorities and to come home with him, but Carrie stays behind. With nowhere else to turn, she asks Otto D\u00fcring (&lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Koch\"&gt;Sebastian Koch&lt;/a&gt;) for access to a private airplane, explaining that she brings ruin to everyone around her and that she wants to simply disappear.\nQuinn (&lt;a href=\"Rupert%20Friend\"&gt;Rupert Friend&lt;/a&gt;) is rehabilitated by Hussein, a doctor who resides with a group of Syrian &lt;a href=\"jihad\"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;ists. The leader of the group, Hajik (Jarreth Merz), is released from prison due to his prosecution being based on the CIA's illegal spying. Hajik suspects Quinn of being an American spy, but Quinn is able to convince the rest of the group that he is a mercenary. When Quinn is healthy enough to leave, he is attacked by Hajik. Quinn kills him in hand-to-hand combat.\nSaul arrives at the station to find that much of his clearances have been revoked, and that he's locked out of the computer system. Saul sneaks onto Mills' computer to copy the leaked documents and then goes to a private club owned by D\u00fcring. He asks D\u00fcring to deliver the documents to Carrie. They are quickly accosted by CIA personnel. The CIA men find nothing after thoroughly searching Saul and D\u00fcring, and then take Saul away. When D\u00fcring stops at the coat check before leaving, he discovers that Saul had already left the documents in his coat pocket. D\u00fcring presents the documents to Carrie before she boards the airplane.\nProduction.\nThe episode was directed by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Graves\"&gt;Alex Graves&lt;/a&gt; and co-written by executive producer &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Johannessen\"&gt;Chip Johannessen&lt;/a&gt; and co-executive producer &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Mann%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Ted Mann&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\nReviews.\nWith 9 positive reviews out of 12, the episode received a rating of 75% with an average score of 7.5 out of 10 on the review aggregator &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, with the site's consensus stating \"'Parabiosis' makes a long-overdue effort to pull the various plots of season five together, even though \"Homeland\" is still taking too long to bring significant parts of its story into focus.\" Joshua Alston of &lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt; gave the episode a \"B+\" grade, praising Carrie's storyline for continuing to explore new ground for the series. However, Alston also expressed reservations about Quinn's storyline, calling it a \"desperate ploy to keep the gutshot Quinn tethered to a story he doesn\u2019t currently have a lot of utility in\". &lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;'s Scott Collura rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying that \"[Mandy] Patinkin\u2019s restrained, tightly wound performance, as always, is one of the best aspects of this show\" and citing the Saul/Dar Adal confrontation as a standout scene. Price Peterson of \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars, and wrote \"'Parabiosis' worked well not only as an acceleration of the season's story, but as sheer moment-by-moment entertainment\".\nRatings.\nThe original broadcast was watched by 1.35 million viewers, an increase in viewership from the previous week of 1.30 million viewers."
