Although a loss for American forces, the battle delayed the British from sailing up the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; in time to relieve Burgoyne's forces at Saratoga. After the fort's demolition, American defenses centered on &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;West Point, New York&lt;/a&gt;, upriver, and the location was not re-used militarily.\nThe town subsequently became the site of a major ore &lt;a href=\"Dock%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;dock&lt;/a&gt;. Ore from the Forest of Dean Mine was shipped via a railroad and an &lt;a href=\"aerial%20tramway\"&gt;aerial tramway&lt;/a&gt; to the dock, where it was loaded into &lt;a href=\"steamboat\"&gt;steamboat&lt;/a&gt;s on the Hudson. Coal for the mine machinery travelled in the opposite direction. Some ore was also mined in the immediate vicinity of Fort Montgomery. The &lt;a href=\"West%20Shore%20Railroad\"&gt;West Shore Railroad&lt;/a&gt; was constructed through the town in the early 1880s.\nLocal mining activity was relatively ephemeral, and the large Forest of Dean Mine was shut down in 1931. With the loss of its main industry, the town sank into decline, accelerated by the end of railroad passenger service in 1958.\nToday, the hamlet is a well-known stop on the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20trail\"&gt;Appalachian trail&lt;/a&gt; due to the close proximity to the trail of its post office, food, and lodging.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 1,418 people, 574 households, and 393 families residing in the CDP.
