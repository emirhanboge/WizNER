    "text": "Kanto (, ) is a popular genre of &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20music\"&gt;Turkish music&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerminology.\n&lt;a href=\"Italian%20opera\"&gt;Italian opera&lt;/a&gt; and theater had a profound effect on &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20culture\"&gt;Turkish culture&lt;/a&gt; during the early 20th century. The terminology of music and theater derived from Italian. In the argot of the improvisational theater of Istanbul the stage was called \"sahano\", backstage was referred to as \"koyuntu\", backdrops depicting countryside as \"bosko\", the applause as \"furi\", and the songs sung as solos or duets between the acts and plays were called \"kanto\". As was the case with their Italian counterparts, the Turkish troupe members played songs and music before the show and between the acts to pique people's interest and draw in customers. Kanto were based on traditional eastern &lt;a href=\"makam\"&gt;makam&lt;/a&gt; but performed with Western instruments.\nTheatrical origins.\nThe improvised theatrical pieces were stage adaptations of the &lt;a href=\"Karag%C3%B6z%20and%20Hacivat\"&gt;Karag\u00f6z&lt;/a&gt; (shadow puppet) and (form of Turkish theatre performed in the open air) traditions, although in a simplified form. The themes explored in these traditional theater arts (as well as their stereotypes) were used as the framework for the new extemporaneous performances of the tuluat (\"improvised\") theater. In this way, kanto may be considered as the unifying feature of all tuluat theater.\nPeriods.\nKanto is usually divided into two periods. The division, particularly in terms of musical structure, is clear between the early kanto (1900s - 1923) and the kanto of the Post-Republican period (especially after the mid-1930s). It is further possible to identify two styles within the early period: &lt;a href=\"Galata\"&gt;Galata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Direkleraras%C4%B1\"&gt;Direkleraras\u0131&lt;/a&gt; (after the neighbourhoods of Old Istanbul).\nEarly period: 1900s\u2013mid-1930s.\nThe early period kanto tradition was nourished in Istanbul. The same was also true in the Post-Republican period. The city's large and diverse population provided the themes that were the mainstay of kanto. Kanto was heavily influenced by musical theatre, Balkan and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20music\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; or Anatolian music (&lt;a href=\"Karsilamas\"&gt;Karsilamas&lt;/a&gt;) (which was however often a subject of satire in kanto songs) and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20music\"&gt;Greek music&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kalamatiano\"&gt;Kalamatiano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballos\"&gt;Ballos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrtos\"&gt;Syrtos&lt;/a&gt;) (especially the Istanbul Rum who were so fond of urban forms of entertainment). In other words, kanto was the result of cultural exchange and almost all the early kanto singers were either Rum or Armenian: &lt;a href=\"Pepron\"&gt;Pepron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Caracach%20Efendi\"&gt;Karakas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haim%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Haim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shamiram%20Kelleciyan\"&gt;Shamiram Kelleciyan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peruz%20Terzekyan\"&gt;Peruz Terzekyan&lt;/a&gt; (all of them performed during the period following 1903).\nGalata and Direkleraras\u0131.\n&lt;a href=\"Galata\"&gt;Galata&lt;/a&gt; was the part of Istanbul where sailors, rowdies, and roustabouts used to frequent. Ahmet Rasim Bey gives a vivid picture of the Galata theaters in his novel Fuhs-i Akit \"An Old Whore\":\n\"Everyone thought Peruz was the most flirtatious, most skillful and the most provocative. The seats closest to the stage were always crammed full... They said of Peruz, 'she is a trollop who has ensnared the heart of many a young man and has made herself the enemy of many. 'Her songs would hardly be finished when chairs, flowers, bouquets and beribboned letters. Come flying from the boxseats. It seemed the building would be shaken to the ground.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Vefa\"&gt;Direkleraras\u0131&lt;/a&gt; in comparison to Galata was a more refined center of entertainment. Direkleraras\u0131 was said to be quite lively at night during the month of Ramadan (or Ramazan in Turkish). It was there that the troupes of Kel Hasan and Abdi Efendi and later that of Neshid gained popularity. Under the influence of these masters kanto had its golden years.\nThe troupes' orchestras featured instruments such as the &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"trombone\"&gt;trombone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Drum%20kit\"&gt;trap drum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cymbal\"&gt;cymbal&lt;/a&gt;s. The orchestra would start to play contemporary popular songs and marches about an hour before the beginning of main show. This intermission music ended up with the well known \u0130zmir Mar\u015f\u0131 (Izmir March); a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as soon as the musicians had taken their places at the side of the stage.\nProminent artists include: Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and B\u00fcy\u00fck Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin.\n1923\u2013mid-1930s: decline in popularity.\nAfter the 1923 &lt;a href=\"Single-party%20period%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;formation of the Turkish Republic&lt;/a&gt;, there were changes in the cultural life of Turkey. It was a period of rapid transformation and its effects were widespread. Turkish women had finally won the freedom to appear on the stage, breaking the monopoly previously held by &lt;a href=\"R%C3%BBm\"&gt;R\u00fbm&lt;/a&gt; (Istanbul Greek) and &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20people\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; women who performed both in musical and non-musical theatre. Institutions such as &lt;a href=\"Darulbedayi\"&gt;Darulbedayi&lt;/a&gt; (Istanbul City Theatre) and &lt;a href=\"Darulelhan\"&gt;Darulelhan&lt;/a&gt; (Istanbul Conservatory of Music) had trained musicians that turned out to work as kanto artists.\nBefore the 1930s, Western lifestyle and western art had put pressure on the traditional Turkish formats which were marginalized. The &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tango%20%28ballroom%29\"&gt;tango&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20%28dance%29\"&gt;charleston&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"foxtrot\"&gt;foxtrot&lt;/a&gt; overshadowed kanto. Kanto's popularity began to fade, the centers of entertainment shifted and the theaters of Galata and Direkleraras\u0131 were eventually closed. Turkish female artists who were not receptive to kanto's typical ribaldry chose to turn away from it.\nThemes.\nThe kanto singers of this period were also composers. The songs had simple melodies combined with lyrics that described the tensions between men and women, or explored love themes, or just reflected local events of the time. The compositions were in well-known makams such as Rast, H\u00fczzam, Hicaz, H\u00fcseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and their creators.\nLate 1930s and beyond.\nThere occurred a new change of trends after the late 1930s: there was a revival of interest in the kanto form. Although rather far from its fundamental principles a new type of kanto was once again popular. Kanto was not anymore exclusively limited to stage performances; there began to exist records produced in studios. While the lyrics began to include satirical takes on contemporary cultural trends and fashion. The songs were recorded with the 78 rpm phonograph. Columbia was the leading record label that commissioned kanto from &lt;a href=\"Kaptanzade%20Ali%20R%C4%B1za%20Bey\"&gt;Kaptanzade Ali R\u0131za Bey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Refik%20Fersan\"&gt;Refik Fersan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dramal%C4%B1%20Hasan\"&gt;Dramal\u0131 Hasan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadettin%20Kaynak\"&gt;Sadettin Kaynak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%C3%BCmb%C3%BC%C5%9F%20Mehmet\"&gt;C\u00fcmb\u00fc\u015f Mehmet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mildan%20Niyazi%20Bey\"&gt;Mildan Niyazi Bey&lt;/a&gt;. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by &lt;a href=\"c%C3%BCmb%C3%BC%C5%9F\"&gt;c\u00fcmb\u00fc\u015f&lt;/a&gt; (a fretlees &lt;a href=\"banjo\"&gt;banjo&lt;/a&gt;-like instrument) the &lt;a href=\"Oud\"&gt;ud&lt;/a&gt; (a fretless &lt;a href=\"lute\"&gt;lute&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"calpara\"&gt;calpara&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"castanets\"&gt;castanets&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Foxtrot\"&gt;Foxtrot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20%28dance%29\"&gt;charleston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rhumba\"&gt;rumba&lt;/a&gt; rhythms were combined with the typical kanto forms.\nFemale soloists from this period include: &lt;a href=\"Makbule%20Enver\"&gt;Makbule Enver&lt;/a&gt;, Mahmure, and Neriman; &lt;a href=\"Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9Fl%C4%B1%20Kemal%20Senman\"&gt;Be\u015fikta\u015fl\u0131 Kemal Senman&lt;/a&gt; was the most sought after male singer for duets.\nThemes.\nAmong the themes explored by the new kantocu (singer(s) or composer(s) of kanto), the most frequent subject of satire was the new role of women after the formation of the Republic. Songs like \"Sarho\u015f K\u0131zlar\" (Drunken Girls) or \"\u015eof\u00f6r Kad\u0131nlar\" (Female Drivers) were written in revenge for all the suffering women had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other songs with similar themes include \"Daktilo\" (The Typewriter) (which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires Society), \"Bereli K\u0131z\" (The Girl with the Beret), \"Kad\u0131n Asker\", and \"Olursa\" (If Women Were Soldiers).\nContemporary use of the term.\nKanto had a tremendous impact on contemporary Turkish popular music. However, the word Kanto eventually became more of a generalized umbrella term than a precise definition of a musical genre. Any tune that does not follow any conventions, or any song that appealed to the trends and tastes of the time it is released is labeled kanto. Any music instrumented in a novel way is also labeled kanto.\n&lt;a href=\"Nurhan%20Damc%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Nurhan Damc\u0131o\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a contemporary (post 1980s) artist labeled as a kanto singer.\nRhythms.\nMost rebetiko songs are based on traditional Greek or Anatolian dance rhythms. Most common are:"
