    "text": "Hwandudaedo (\"ring-pommel sword\") is the modern Korean term for one of earliest original types of &lt;a href=\"Korean%20sword\"&gt;Korean sword&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in the &lt;a href=\"Proto%E2%80%93Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms of Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese swords were at first symbols of a ruler's power, but their availability increased in the 5th century, and it became a more widespread symbol of military or political rank. The frequency of finds declines in the 6th century.\nThe \"hwandudaedo\" was a large military sword made for battle, as it had a thick back and sharpened blade. This sword's name was given because of the round shape of the pommel ( \ub300\ub3c4\u628a\u982d). The swords were richly decorated, with inlay work and especially by elaborate &lt;a href=\"pommel%20%28sword%29\"&gt;pommel (sword)&lt;/a&gt; shapes.\nHwandudaedo subtypes are distinguished based on their decoration. They include \" Sohwandudaedo\" (no decoration on the pommel rings), \"Samyeophwandudaedo\" (pommel ring with three opened leaves), \"Samruhwandudaedo\" (three pommel rings forming a triangle), \"Yonghwandudaedo\" (pommel with &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;), \"Bonghwandudaedo\" (pommel with &lt;a href=\"phoenix%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt;), \"Bonghwangmun\" (a pattern of a legendary bird), \"Indongdangchomun, Samyeopmun, Wondudaedo, Gyududaedo, Samruhwandudaedo, Bangdudaedo, Duchudaedo\".\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.arscives.com/historysteel/koreanarticle.htm\"&gt;History and characteristics of Korean Swords by Park Je Gwang \u2013 Curator War Memorial of Korea&lt;/a&gt;"
