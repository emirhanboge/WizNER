    "text": "Christine Nee is an &lt;a href=\"Irish-American\"&gt;Irish-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"children%27s%20television\"&gt;children's television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"screenwriter\"&gt;screenwriter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TV%20producer\"&gt;producer&lt;/a&gt;. Nee is best known as the creator of \"&lt;a href=\"Doc%20McStuffins\"&gt;Doc McStuffins&lt;/a&gt;\", which she describes as \"&lt;a href=\"Cheers\"&gt;Cheers&lt;/a&gt;\" for Preschoolers.\" She has previously worked as an &lt;a href=\"associate%20producer\"&gt;associate producer&lt;/a&gt; on several &lt;a href=\"Sesame%20Street%20international%20co-productions\"&gt;international versions&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Sesame%20Street\"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCareer.\nNee said that while she did not originally connect with any shows because she did not see herself \"represented onscreen,\" she first tried to be an actor. Realizing she couldn't fit in, she worked on scripts for \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%27s%20Clues\"&gt;Blue's Clues&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2001 and \"Wonder Pets\", continuing to work as a producer, the latter on \"&lt;a href=\"Deadliest%20Catch\"&gt;Deadliest Catch&lt;/a&gt;\" for two episodes.\nNee conceived of her award-winning show, \"&lt;a href=\"Doc%20McStuffins\"&gt;Doc McStuffins&lt;/a&gt;\" while in the shower after her son had visited the doctor for asthma a few days before. It was her idea to make the lead character female and she readily agreed when Nancy Kanter, the creative head of &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Junior\"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that she should be &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt;. Although some at Disney were hesitant originally that a show with a female lead \"might not have mass appeal,\" this did not deter Kanter, and within a year of the show's release in 2012, \"merchandise generated about $500 million in sales.\" Nee said she was very pleased that her character had unusual background for a TV character, and hoped this would influence the next generation.\nIn March 2016, it was announced that Nee will be executive producer of a Disney Junior series, \"&lt;a href=\"Vampirina\"&gt;Vampirina&lt;/a&gt;\", based on the children's picture book \"Vampirina Ballerina\". The series, which featured many of the same staff who worked on \"Doc McStuffins\", premiered on October 1, 2017. The series ended on June 28, 2021 after 3 seasons and 75 episodes during its 4-year run.\nIn April 2019, Nee joined other WGA writers in firing their agents as part of the &lt;a href=\"Writers%20Guild%20of%20America\"&gt;WGA's&lt;/a&gt; stand against the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Talent%20Agents\"&gt;ATA&lt;/a&gt; and the unfair practice of &lt;a href=\"Movie%20packaging\"&gt;packaging&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 4, 2021, a 10-part series of animated music videos, which Nee created, titled \"&lt;a href=\"We%20the%20People%20%282021%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;We the People&lt;/a&gt;\", premiered on &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. Kenya Barris was also a showrunner and the series was produced by &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Obama\"&gt;Michelle Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. On July 13, 2021, \"&lt;a href=\"Ridley%20Jones\"&gt;Ridley Jones&lt;/a&gt;\", an animated series meant for children, is set to debut on the same network. It is part of a slate of animated preschool series on the streaming service, with others including \"Spirit Rangers\", \"Dino Daycare\", and \"Ada Twist, Scientist\", of which Nee is the showrunner.\nPersonal life.\nAt age 18, during the 1980s, Nee came out as lesbian. In June 2021, she described herself as a gay and \"relatively &lt;a href=\"Butch%20and%20femme%23Butch\"&gt;butch&lt;/a&gt;\" woman. She has one child, a son."
