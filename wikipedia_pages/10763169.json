    "text": "Robert Douglas Flynn, Jr. (born April 18, 1951) is an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; former professional &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. He played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) from 1975 to 1985 as an &lt;a href=\"infielder\"&gt;infielder&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt;. Flynn was a member of two world championship winning teams with the Cincinnati Reds and won a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Glove%20Award\"&gt;Gold Glove Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 as a member of the New York Mets.\nEarly life.\nFlynn was born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Lexington%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Lexington, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Station%20High%20School\"&gt;Bryan Station High School&lt;/a&gt;, where he starred in &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; on a 12-1 team. He went to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kentucky\"&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; on a combination baseball-basketball scholarship. While attending Kentucky, Flynn and some friends went to a Cincinnati Reds tryout camp. Flynn made the cut. After one more tryout camp and yet another audition at &lt;a href=\"Riverfront%20Stadium\"&gt;Riverfront Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the Reds signed him as an amateur free agent in .\nPlaying career.\nCincinnati Reds.\nFlynn batted .245 with six home runs and 113 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; over three seasons in the Reds' &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt;. Still, his glove impressed Reds &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sparky%20Anderson\"&gt;Sparky Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having played &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; predominantly in the minors, Flynn went into &lt;a href=\"Spring%20training\"&gt;Spring training&lt;/a&gt; battling &lt;a href=\"Darrell%20Chaney\"&gt;Darrell Chaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Driessen\"&gt;Dan Driessen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Vukovich\"&gt;John Vukovich&lt;/a&gt; for the open &lt;a href=\"third%20base\"&gt;third base&lt;/a&gt; job.\nHe made the team, but as a &lt;a href=\"utility%20infielder\"&gt;utility infielder&lt;/a&gt;, and made his major league debut on April 9 against the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; at short. Starting the following night, Flynn scored his first major league &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; after reaching on a force play on the fourth &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;. Three innings later, he chased Dodgers &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Rhoden\"&gt;Rick Rhoden&lt;/a&gt; out of the game with his first career &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; to center.\nFlynn batted just .172 with no home runs or RBIs in April. With Reds third basemen batting a combined .162, Anderson shifted perennial &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; MVP &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Rose\"&gt;Pete Rose&lt;/a&gt; to third, with &lt;a href=\"George%20Foster%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;George Foster&lt;/a&gt; taking over in left. The shift worked, as the team won 108 games that season to storm to a first-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;National League West&lt;/a&gt; by twenty games over the Dodgers. The reduced role also seemed to do Flynn's bat some good. Over the rest of the season, Flynn batted .296 with twenty RBI. He hit his first major league &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; on May 21 against the New York Mets, a game in which &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Seaver\"&gt;Tom Seaver&lt;/a&gt; was the losing &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlynn saw semi-regular action early in the season due to a back injury to &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Morgan\"&gt;Joe Morgan&lt;/a&gt;. During a nine-game stretch in June, Flynn batted .382. He ended up appearing in 93 games for the \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Red%20Machine\"&gt;Big Red Machine&lt;/a&gt;\", as they became affectionately called, and batted .283 with one home run and twenty RBIs. The Reds won the and &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Flynn's only postseason appearance came as a defensive replacement in the &lt;a href=\"1976%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;1976 National League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlynn's role with the Reds decreased drastically in 1977. Through June 12, he appeared in 36 games, mostly as a late inning defensive replacement for Rose at third. Meanwhile, Tom Seaver was in a contract dispute with New York Mets chairman &lt;a href=\"M.%20Donald%20Grant\"&gt;M. Donald Grant&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, June 15, 1977 Grant traded Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds for &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Henderson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Steve Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Norman\"&gt;Dan Norman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Zachry\"&gt;Pat Zachry&lt;/a&gt; and Flynn.\nNew York Mets.\nFlynn's playing time increased substantially upon his arrival in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, even though he batted just .191 with no home runs and fourteen RBIs. Most of his playing time came at short, but he spent time at second base as well. Following the season, the Mets reacquired formed number one overall draft pick &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Foli\"&gt;Tim Foli&lt;/a&gt; to play short. Just as pitchers and &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt;s were reporting to Spring training, the Mets sold the contract of &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20Mill%C3%A1n\"&gt;F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Taiyo%20Whales\"&gt;Taiyo Whales&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball\"&gt;Nippon Professional Baseball&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of using Flynn at second.\nHe began the season at second, but shifted to short when Foli injured his knee at the end of April, and returned there periodically throughout the remainder of the season. All told, he logged 430 innings at short, committing just seven &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; for a .968 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. At second, he logged the league's second best fielding percentage (behind the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Cash%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Dave Cash&lt;/a&gt;) at .986. With the bat, Flynn produced a modest .237 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; with no home runs and 36 RBIs in the eighth spot of manager &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Torre\"&gt;Joe Torre&lt;/a&gt;'s batting order, however, he tied &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Randle\"&gt;Lenny Randle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Youngblood\"&gt;Joel Youngblood&lt;/a&gt; for the team lead with eight &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triples&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlynn's first home run as a Met was a three-run shot off future &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;r &lt;a href=\"Gaylord%20Perry\"&gt;Gaylord Perry&lt;/a&gt; on May 1, . It was also his only career four RBI game. On June 12, just three days shy of the second anniversary of the \"Midnight Massacre\", Flynn hit his second home run, an inside-the-park three run homer, against the Reds to cap off a 12-6 Mets victory. Flynn seemed to be at his best against his former club. A week earlier, he &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; in the tying run, and later scored the go-ahead run in the Mets' 5\u20133 win over Cincinnati, and produced a .310 batting average with seven RBIs against Reds pitching. All told, 1979 was Flynn's best offensive season, as he batted .243 with career highs in home runs (4) and RBIs (61). He also began to emerge as one of the better fielding second basemen in the National League. He led the league in &lt;a href=\"putout\"&gt;putout&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;s turned, and was third in the league with a .983 fielding percentage.\nOn August 5, , Flynn tied a major league record with three triples in one game. He also scored all three times. For the week, he batted .419 (13 for 31) with five runs scored and five RBIs to be named NL Player of the Week. Still, Flynn's greatest contribution to his club was with his glove. His .991 fielding percentage was tops in the league, and earned him the National League &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Glove\"&gt;Gold Glove&lt;/a&gt; Award at second base. He was just the third Met ever to receive this honor (&lt;a href=\"Tommie%20Agee\"&gt;Tommie Agee&lt;/a&gt; in and Bud Harrelson in being the first two).\nFlynn signed a new five-year contract before the season, but that did not prevent it from being his last season as a Met. With top prospect &lt;a href=\"Wally%20Backman\"&gt;Wally Backman&lt;/a&gt; ready to make the jump to the majors, the Mets traded Flynn to the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Boitano\"&gt;Dan Boitano&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kern\"&gt;Jim Kern&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the season. Kern was then packaged with &lt;a href=\"Greg%20A.%20Harris\"&gt;Greg Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Trevi%C3%B1o\"&gt;Alex Trevi\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; for George Foster from the Cincinnati Reds.\nRangers, Expos and Tigers.\nJust prior to the start of the season, the Rangers traded incumbent second baseman &lt;a href=\"Bump%20Wills\"&gt;Bump Wills&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;, opening the starting job for Flynn. As the season wore on, rookie prospect &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Richardt\"&gt;Mike Richardt&lt;/a&gt; began getting the bulk of the playing time at second with Flynn splitting his time between second and short. The &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt; had used seven different players at second base, and were desperate need of an upgrade at that position when they purchased Flynn's contract from Texas on August 2.\nHe held the starting second base job with the Expos through . At the 1984 &lt;a href=\"Winter%20meetings\"&gt;Winter meetings&lt;/a&gt;, the Expos acquired third baseman &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Law\"&gt;Vance Law&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;. Law had also played some second and was a shortstop in the minors. The intention was to convert him into a second baseman in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. Once the experiment proved successful, the Expos placed Flynn on waivers. Though the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; expressed interest, he ended up signing with the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of the season. He retired from &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; when the Tigers released him in Spring training the following season.\nAfter retirement, Flynn shortly took up slow-pitch softball, playing on several traveling tournament teams in the late 80's and early 90's.\nPersonal life.\nFlynn's father, Bobby, was a second baseman in the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Dodgers\"&gt;Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;' organization in , and later played semi-pro ball with the Lexington Hustlers. While his son was coming up through the Reds' minor league system, Bobby was also climbing politically, serving as Kentucky state senator. His mother also played second base in fast-pitch softball for years. After retirement from baseball, Flynn spent a couple of years working in the Mets minor league system. He then headed up the state of Kentucky's anti-drug program.\nFlynn\u2019s younger sister, Melanie, went missing in 1977 at the age of 24 and has not been heard from since. The case is heavily featured in the 1990 book \"The Bluegrass Conspiracy\".\nHis wife, Olga, is a former &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cheerleader\"&gt;cheerleader&lt;/a&gt; whom he was set up with by Pete Rose. They were married in February 1982 and they currently live in Lexington, Kentucky. Doug has been a banking officer for Central Bank, a locally owned, independent bank, since 1998.\nIn 1981, Flynn began singing &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; songs at Cody's, a club at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. When baseball went on strike in 1981, Flynn traveled briefly with the &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Ridge%20Boys\"&gt;Oak Ridge Boys&lt;/a&gt; and sang on tour with them. He still loves to sing and pairs up with former Reds teammate &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Bench\"&gt;Johnny Bench&lt;/a&gt; at their successful golf tournament every year on cabaret night. He still attends both New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds reunion events including serving as the Chairman of the Reds Fantasy Camp and guest for the Mets camp.\nIn early 2010, he faced a bout with thyroid cancer. '\"They took my thyroid out, and it did a little damage to my voice box, but I'm doing good\", Flynn said later that year, his voice giving away little hint of what's happened.'\nBeginning in 2013, Flynn worked as a part-time radio broadcaster for the Cincinnati Reds, filling in for several games a year when one of their regular complement of broadcasters had some time off. He also appears periodically on Reds' TV broadcasts on &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Ohio\"&gt;Fox Sports Ohio&lt;/a&gt; hosting feature segments. Flynn also appears on &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats%20baseball\"&gt;Kentucky Wildcats baseball&lt;/a&gt; games carried on the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Network\"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/a&gt; and SEC Network Plus.\nSince 2015, Flynn has hosted \"&lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Life\"&gt;Kentucky Life&lt;/a&gt;\", a weekly half-hour magazine program on &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Educational%20Television\"&gt;Kentucky Educational Television&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/F/Pflynd001.htm\"&gt;Retrosheet&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//ultimatemets.com/profile.php%3FPlayerCode%3D0264\"&gt;The Ultimate Mets Database&lt;/a&gt;"
