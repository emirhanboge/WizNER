    "text": "Wanderers Special Club (often abbreviated as Wanderers SC) were a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand.\nThe team was age-restricted, and featured only players below 20 years of age. The club was formed to develop players for the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20under-20%20football%20team\"&gt;New Zealand national under-20 football team&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the then up-coming &lt;a href=\"2015%20FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, hosted in New Zealand. New Zealand Football High Performance Director &lt;a href=\"Fred%20de%20Jong\"&gt;Fred de Jong&lt;/a&gt; said that \"one of the objectives is to retain our top young players in New Zealand for longer, and entry into the &lt;a href=\"ASB%20Premiership\"&gt;ASB Premiership&lt;/a&gt; gives us an opportunity to prepare in a cost effective manner when compared to touring the team internationally.\"\nThe club is considered to be a continuation of Northern-Based, an under-17 team that played in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Youth%20League%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;ASB Youth League&lt;/a&gt; and provided several players to New Zealand for the &lt;a href=\"2013%20OFC%20U-17%20Championship\"&gt;2013 OFC U-17 Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team entered the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20ASB%20Premiership\"&gt;2013\u201314 ASB Premiership&lt;/a&gt; season, replacing outgoing &lt;a href=\"YoungHeart%20Manawatu\"&gt;YoungHeart Manawatu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team was withdrawn from the ASB Premiership following the completion of the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20ASB%20Premiership\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; season."
