    "text": "Plasmodiophora bicaudata is a marine &lt;a href=\"plant%20pathology\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"obligate%20parasite\"&gt;obligate parasite&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Zostera\"&gt;Zostera&lt;/a&gt;\" and the causal agent of wasting disease in the genus. These marine plants grow in fine sediment in shallow seas and the pathogen seems to have a worldwide distribution.\nBiology.\nThe life cycle of \"Plasmodiophora bicaudata\" is complex. It includes &lt;a href=\"resting%20spore\"&gt;resting spore&lt;/a&gt;s which can lie &lt;a href=\"Dormancy\"&gt;dormant&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting suitable conditions to infect a new plant. Its other forms include two types of &lt;a href=\"Plasmodium%20%28life%20cycle%29\"&gt;plasmodia&lt;/a&gt;, the feeding stage that derive their energy from the &lt;a href=\"Host%20%28biology%29\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; cells, and two types of &lt;a href=\"zoospore\"&gt;zoospore&lt;/a&gt;s. The motile zoospores are the only form that can move outside the host cells. They have whiplash &lt;a href=\"flagella\"&gt;flagella&lt;/a&gt; and can swim to reach new seagrass plants and can also crawl on the surface of the leaves in an &lt;a href=\"Amoeba\"&gt;amoeboid&lt;/a&gt; way by extending &lt;a href=\"Pseudopodium\"&gt;pseudopodia&lt;/a&gt; forward. This parasite causes &lt;a href=\"gall\"&gt;gall&lt;/a&gt;s to form in the internodes of the &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;s of its host seagrasses, species of the genus \"Zostera\". The condition is known as wasting disease, the nodes bunch up together and root development is poor so the plants are more easily uprooted in storms. Detached floating plants may spread the infection to new areas and when the seagrass has been planted for erosion control, the target seabed cover may not be achieved. The growth of leaves seems little affected by the parasite but flowering of the seagrass does not take place. The galls contain a large number of thick-walled, dormant spores 4-6 &lt;a href=\"micrometre\"&gt;\u03bcm&lt;/a&gt; in diameter that are separate from one another. The infection of seagrasses by this parasite has been little studied but it is possible that it is a &lt;a href=\"vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt;, able to transmit disease-causing &lt;a href=\"Plant%20virus\"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; between plants as happens in some terrestrial species in this &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt;. This has not yet been observed in the marine environment."
