    "text": "Legislative elections were held in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; on 9 December 2012. The &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; (USL) of Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Ponta\"&gt;Victor Ponta&lt;/a&gt; won an absolute majority in both the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the severe weather in parts of the country, the turnout was at 42%, slightly higher than the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Romanian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;last legislative elections held in 2008&lt;/a&gt; which saw a turnout of 39%.\nThe Social Liberal Union (USL) obtained a huge majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with 60% and 59% respectively of the votes and in MP mandates, a record number of 395 seats. Far behind, the &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;Right Romania Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (ARD) came in second place with only 17% of the vote and 80 seats, losing about half of what they won in 2008.\nThe ARD was officially dissolved after the elections. &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Dan%20Diaconescu\"&gt;People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu&lt;/a&gt; (PP\u2013DD) and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Alliance%20of%20Hungarians%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania&lt;/a&gt; (UDMR/RMDSZ) were the only other political groups that won seats in the Senate. Several &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20ethnic%20minorities%20parties\"&gt;parties for ethnic minorities&lt;/a&gt; also received individual seats in the Chamber of Deputies.\nBackground.\nProtests.\nFollowing weeks of demonstrations against &lt;a href=\"austerity%20measures\"&gt;austerity measures&lt;/a&gt; demanded by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; for a multi-billion US dollar loan, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Boc\"&gt;Emil Boc&lt;/a&gt; resigned from his post on 6 February 2012. The opposition, represented by &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; leaders &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Ponta\"&gt;Victor Ponta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crin%20Antonescu\"&gt;Crin Antonescu&lt;/a&gt;, then called for early elections. However, as the three parties behind the government (&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20of%20Hungarians%20in%20Romania\"&gt;UDMR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20for%20the%20Progress%20of%20Romania\"&gt;UNPR&lt;/a&gt;) still relied on a slight parliamentary majority, an interim solution was agreed with the opposition that the government could stay in power until the next elections, conditional of electing a political independent technocrat as the new &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;. The former &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Intelligence%20Service%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; Director &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20R%C4%83zvan%20Ungureanu\"&gt;Mihai R\u0103zvan Ungureanu&lt;/a&gt; was appointed interim prime minister on 9 February as a result.\nThe government announced the intention to hold legislative and &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20local%20election\"&gt;local elections&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, by lengthening the term of the local elected officials (Mayors, Local Councils, County Councils and County Councils Presidents). It was suspected the attempt to delay local elections were related to the fact, that massive street protests had erupted, and at the same time the Opposition political alliance &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; went on strike in &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, pushing for early legislative elections to be called one or two weeks after local elections in June. Initially, the government proposed an election date in November 2012, but as the mayoral mandates expire in June 2012, this was ruled unconstitutional. The local elections were eventually held on &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20local%20election\"&gt;10 June&lt;/a&gt;, with an unexpected runoff and three repeated elections on 17 June.\nMotion of no confidence.\nThe political alliance &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt;, at that time comprising the three parties &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PNL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, initiated and succeeded to vote a &lt;a href=\"motion%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;motion of no confidence&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20R%C4%83zvan%20Ungureanu\"&gt;Mihai R\u0103zvan Ungureanu&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Ungureanu%20Cabinet\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; on 27 April 2012 after just two months in office. &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Romania\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Traian%20Basescu\"&gt;Traian Basescu&lt;/a&gt; nominated Opposition leader and president of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Ponta\"&gt;Victor Ponta&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Prime minister&lt;/a&gt;.\nElectoral system.\nIn May 2012, the new &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;USL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"First%20Ponta%20cabinet\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; passed an electoral law in parliament, which changed the election system to a single-round &lt;a href=\"First-past-the-post%20voting\"&gt;FPTP&lt;/a&gt; system without the 5% &lt;a href=\"electoral%20threshold\"&gt;electoral threshold&lt;/a&gt; with extra seats for minorities, both ethnic minorities and Romanian minorities. However, after PDL, fearing poor results in the elections ahead because of it, appealed the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Constitutional Court of Romania&lt;/a&gt; who invalidated the law on 27 June 2012 and reinstated the old one.\nA consequence of this is that after the 2012 legislative elections the size of the new Parliament grew to a record total number of 588, an added 117 seats than in the last legislature: 39 supplementary &lt;a href=\"Senate%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; seats, and 97 supplementary &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; seats, including the 18 seats for the ethnic minorities parties and organisations.\nParty standings and political alliances.\nIn late 2010, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20PSD%2BPUR\"&gt;PSD+PC Alliance&lt;/a&gt; broke up without affecting the &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt; seat held by the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2011, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;National Liberal Party \u2013 PNL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Conservative Party \u2013 PC&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Right%20Alliance\"&gt;Centre Right Alliance \u2013 ACD&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2011, &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Right%20Alliance\"&gt;ACD&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Social Democratic Party \u2013 PSD&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union \u2013 USL&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20local%20election\"&gt;local election&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PSD&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20for%20the%20Progress%20of%20Romania\"&gt;National Union for the Progress of Romania \u2013 UNPR&lt;/a&gt; formed the Centre Left Alliance, thus &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20for%20the%20Progress%20of%20Romania\"&gt;UNPR&lt;/a&gt; joining &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;USL&lt;/a&gt; in mid 2012.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20local%20election\"&gt;2012 local election&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt; formed various county-level alliances with a wide range of parties, including &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20for%20the%20Progress%20of%20Romania\"&gt;UNPR&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20presidential%20impeachment%20referendum\"&gt;presidential impeachment referendum&lt;/a&gt; it urged the formation of a political alliance with a number of minor political parties and foundations, such as &lt;a href=\"New%20Republic%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;New Republic&lt;/a&gt; led by Mihail Neam\u021bu, and the centre-right Civic Initiative led by &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20R%C4%83zvan%20Ungureanu\"&gt;Mihai R\u0103zvan Ungureanu&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20R%C4%83zvan%20Ungureanu\"&gt;Ungureanu&lt;/a&gt; joined a minor party, &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Force\"&gt;Civic Force&lt;/a&gt; (FC), and was elected its president. The alliance registered at the Central Electoral Bureau was called &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;Right Romania Alliance \u2013 ARD&lt;/a&gt; formed by &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian-Democratic%20National%20Peasants%27%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PN\u021a-CD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Force\"&gt;FC&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpinion polling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt; centred &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; alliance was formed late after the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Romanian%20presidential%20impeachment%20referendum\"&gt;2012 Romanian presidential impeachment referendum&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, some opinion polls do not include the &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt;. Opinion polls that show &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PDL&lt;/a&gt; do not show &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20for%20the%20Progress%20of%20Romania\"&gt;UNPR&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;USL&lt;/a&gt; in August\u2013September 2012, in a sceptical environment. As a result, some opinion polls show both political entities. &lt;a href=\"New%20Generation%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PNG-CD&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Gigi%20Becali\"&gt;George Becali&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;PNL&lt;/a&gt; an runs backed by the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;USL&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. His former party did not propose any candidates for this election.\nCandidates.\nOut of the 12 contesting parties running for the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, only three submitted a full list of candidates: &lt;a href=\"Social%20Liberal%20Union\"&gt;Social Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Right%20Romania%20Alliance\"&gt;Right Romania Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20-%20Dan%20Diaconescu\"&gt;People's Party - Dan Diaconescu&lt;/a&gt; submitted a list with one candidate less than all the available colleges. Only one independent candidate decided to run for the Senate, and 12 for the Chamber of Deputies. There were 18 national minorities associations proposing one candidate each for the Chamber of Deputies.\nResults.\nThe Social Liberal Union maintained majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.\nLocal referendums.\nTwo local non-binding referendums were also organized on 9 December, concerning environmental issues.\nThe first one took place in &lt;a href=\"Alba%20county\"&gt;Alba county&lt;/a&gt; and people were asked whether they were in favor or against the &lt;a href=\"Ro%C8%99ia%20Montan%C4%83\"&gt;Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ro%C8%99ia%20Montan%C4%83%20Project\"&gt;mining project&lt;/a&gt;. Although 62% of those who voted voiced support for the controversial project, the referendum did not meet the required turnout of 50%, as only 43,2% of voters turned up.\nThe second referendum was held in the communes of &lt;a href=\"Limanu\"&gt;Limanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costine%C8%99ti\"&gt;Costine\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the city of &lt;a href=\"Mangalia\"&gt;Mangalia&lt;/a&gt; and asked voters to say whether they were in favor or against the use, by &lt;a href=\"Chevron%20Corporation\"&gt;Chevron&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"shale%20gas\"&gt;shale gas&lt;/a&gt; extraction by means of &lt;a href=\"hydraulic%20fracturing\"&gt;hydraulic fracturing&lt;/a&gt;. This referendum failed to meet the required turnout as well.\nIncidents.\nAlthough a report by the OSCE stated the elections were administered \"professionally and efficiently\", the &lt;a href=\"electioneering\"&gt;electioneering&lt;/a&gt;, initiated on 9 November and ended on 8 December, was not without incidents.\n&lt;a href=\"Dan%20Diaconescu\"&gt;Dan Diaconescu&lt;/a&gt;, candidate from &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Dan%20Diaconescu\"&gt;PP-DD&lt;/a&gt; in the same college of Chamber of Deputies in &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgu%20Jiu\"&gt;T\u00e2rgu Jiu&lt;/a&gt; with Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Ponta\"&gt;Victor Ponta&lt;/a&gt;, is investigated for electoral bribery. Authorities were notified after PSD representatives within Gorj County Council filed a complaint regarding the distribution of food and the organization of an electoral spectacle before the electioneering. According to the Emergency Ordinance issued on 6 November by &lt;a href=\"First%20Ponta%20cabinet\"&gt;Ponta Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, offering food, drink and money in the campaign is illegal.\nOn 11 November, an old man from the commune of &lt;a href=\"M%C4%83t%C4%83sari\"&gt;M\u0103t\u0103sari&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gorj%20County\"&gt;Gorj County&lt;/a&gt;) had a heart attack shortly after a discussion in contradictory with PDL deputy Constantin Severus Militaru. PDL deputy said that the old man was very indignant because his pension was not recalculated, although he had worked all his life in mining.\nThe President of PDL Vrancea, Alin Tr\u0103\u0219culescu, was caught in the act by anticorruption prosecutors while receiving \u20ac50,000 from a businessman in the form of bribe. He was detained for 24 hours for allegations of lobbyism, instigation to false and incitement to the misdemeanor of money laundering. Alin Tr\u0103\u0219culescu was under the supervision of National Anticorruption Department for two years. He claimed he could get contracts with the State, from the Ministry of Development and Tourism, led then by &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Udrea\"&gt;Elena Udrea&lt;/a&gt;."
