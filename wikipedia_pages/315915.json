    "text": "Sports in Puerto Rico can be traced from the ceremonial competitions amongst the &lt;a href=\"pre-Columbian\"&gt;pre-Columbian&lt;/a&gt; Native Americans of the Arawak (&lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%ADno%20people\"&gt;Ta\u00edno&lt;/a&gt;) tribes who inhabited the island to the modern era in which sports activities consist of an organized physical activity or skill carried out with a recreational purpose for competition. One of the sports which the Ta\u00edno's played was a ball game called \"Batey\". The \"Batey\" was played in \"U\" shaped fields two teams; however, unlike the ball games of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.\nThe Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as &lt;a href=\"horse%20racing\"&gt;horse racing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cockfighting\"&gt;cockfighting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dominoes\"&gt;dominoes&lt;/a&gt; and a game similar to \"Bowling\" called \"Boliche\". The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports.\nSpain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;. American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico. The sport of baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States.\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though it is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico has participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. On March 2, 1917, Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the enactment of the &lt;a href=\"Jones%E2%80%93Shafroth%20Act\"&gt;Jones\u2013Shafroth Act&lt;/a&gt; (Pub.L. 64\u2013368, 39 Stat. 951) and as such Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland were and still are permitted to participate and represent that country in international sports events. However, their achievements representing the United States is part of the intertwined history of sports in the United States and Puerto Rico.\nThe following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and other countries and of the Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who have excelled in those sports locally and/or in international events as representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country.\nBrief history of sports in Puerto Rico.\nPre-Columbian era.\nThe Ta\u00ednos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called \"Batey\", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a \"U\". The ball was made of vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain number of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray &lt;a href=\"Bartolom%C3%A9%20de%20las%20Casas\"&gt;Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas&lt;/a&gt; the game was played in the following manner: \"One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.\" In 1975, archaeologists from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a \"Batey\" in an area called Tibes, on the outskirts of the city of &lt;a href=\"Ponce%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Ponce&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is now known as \"&lt;a href=\"Centro%20Ceremonial%20Indigena%20de%20Tibes\"&gt;Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes&lt;/a&gt;\" (The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.\nSpanish colonization.\nThe first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were &lt;a href=\"horse%20racing\"&gt;horse racing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cockfighting\"&gt;cockfighting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dominoes\"&gt;dominoes&lt;/a&gt;. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was \"Boliche\". The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. \"Boliche\" was similar to &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt;. Another popular sport was &lt;a href=\"bullfighting\"&gt;bullfighting&lt;/a&gt;, which was limited to the larger cities of &lt;a href=\"Ponce%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Ponce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmerican (United States) colonization.\nIn the late 19th century \"new\" sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;. Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball by the occupying military forces.\nModern era.\nPuerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the Olympic Games.\nPuerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship, Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or moving to the United States, living there for 3 previous years or more and then representing that country in the games. Some Puerto Ricans, such as Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1948%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1948 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event. The island's delegation consisted of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in &lt;a href=\"pole%20vault\"&gt;pole vault&lt;/a&gt;. In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games. The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20%28U.S.%20insular%20area%29\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; on July 25, 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.\nIn 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow, Russian SFSR, USSR in protest of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Soviet invasion of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Germ%C3%A1n%20Rieckehoff\"&gt;Germ\u00e1n Rieckehoff&lt;/a&gt;, who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Mercado\"&gt;Alberto Mercado&lt;/a&gt;, who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.\nIn 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then governor &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Romero%20Barcel%C3%B3\"&gt;Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the &lt;a href=\"Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt; and the Central American and Caribbean Games.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20national%20baseball%20team\"&gt;Puerto Rican national baseball team&lt;/a&gt; won a bronze medal at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;1988 Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul, South Korea, but that medal is not counted among Puerto Rico's Olympic medals totals because baseball was only an exhibition sport during those games.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1988%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1988 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, officially known as the \"XV Olympic Winter Games\", was celebrated in &lt;a href=\"Calgary\"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; between February 13 and 28. It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada. It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent the island in an Olympic ski competition. No Puerto Rican had ever skied in the Olympics. The six-person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native Puerto Ricans. They were &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20Flechas\"&gt;F\u00e9lix Flechas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Sandza\"&gt;Walter Sandza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Wilson%20%28skier%29\"&gt;Kevin Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, his sister &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Pat%20Wilson\"&gt;Mary Pat Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Edelmann\"&gt;Jason Edelmann&lt;/a&gt;. Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico's first and only female Olympic skier. Even though the team did not do well in the competition, they were highly respected by their competitors. Since then. Puerto Rico has participated in all but three of the Winter Olympic Games, missing those of 2006, 2010, and 2014.\n&lt;a href=\"Kristina%20Brandi\"&gt;Kristina Brandi&lt;/a&gt; represented Puerto Rico in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athens%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;. She became the first tennis player representing Puerto Rico to win a singles match in an Olympic when she beat &lt;a href=\"Jelena%20Kostani%C4%87\"&gt;Jelena Kostani\u0107&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; (7\u20135 and 6\u20131). She lost in the second round to Russian &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Myskina\"&gt;Anastasia Myskina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2016 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Rio de Janeiro, &lt;a href=\"Monica%20Puig\"&gt;Monica Puig&lt;/a&gt; made Olympic history when she became the first person to win an Olympic gold medal for Puerto Rico by defeating Germany's &lt;a href=\"Angelique%20Kerber\"&gt;Angelique Kerber&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20singles\"&gt;women's singles tennis&lt;/a&gt; final. She became the first Puerto Rican female medalist in any sport. On August 2, 2021, &lt;a href=\"Jasmine%20Camacho-Quinn\"&gt;Jasmine Camacho-Quinn&lt;/a&gt; won Puerto Rico's second Olympic Gold Medal. She won the medal in the Women's 100m Hurdles in the Olympic games which were celebrated in Tokyo, Japan.\nOlympics medallists.\nThe following table has a list of Puerto Ricans, including people of Puerto Rican ancestry, who won Olympic medals. \"Puerto Ricans\" is a term also used to describe a resident of the United States who was \"born in Puerto Rico or who traces their family ancestry to Puerto Rico.\" Not all represented the island, some represented the United States. Puerto Ricans have won a total of 38 Olympic medals, 28 representing the United States and 10 representing Puerto Rico. \nPuerto Rico at the Paralympic Games.\nPuerto Rico debuted in the &lt;a href=\"Paralympic%20Games\"&gt;Paralympic Games&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"1988%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. In this event, &lt;a href=\"Isabel%20Bustamante\"&gt;Isabel Bustamante&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the first medals for the delegation, winning one gold and two silver medals in athletics. In the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2000 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;, Alexis Pizarro became the first male athlete to win a medal for Puerto Rico, reaching bronze in athletics. Pizarro repeated this performance in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2004 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 20, 2008, &lt;a href=\"David%20Bernier\"&gt;David Bernier&lt;/a&gt; awarded the flag of Puerto Rico to Nilda G\u00f3mez, who was selected to be the flag bearer in the opening ceremonies of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Paralympics\"&gt;2008 Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;. Three athletes that registered A-marks attended the ceremony, which also included Alexis Pizarro in athletics and Julio Reguero in sailing. Puerto Rico's first medal in this edition of the Paralympics was won by G\u00f3mez, who won bronze in &lt;a href=\"Shooting%20sports\"&gt;rifle shooting&lt;/a&gt;. She won bronze in the 10-meter trial, finishing with 489 points.\nPuerto Rico at the Special Olympics.\nPuerto Rico's Special Olympics program was founded in 1970, since then it has offered services to more than a thousand athletes.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Special%20Olympics%20World%20Summer%20Games\"&gt;2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Rico won 57 medals.\nPuerto Rico won a total of 34 medals in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Special%20Olympics%20World%20Summer%20Games\"&gt;2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games&lt;/a&gt;, including 7 gold, 18 silver and 9 bronze medals. Due to the team's performance, the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Senate of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; organized a ceremony where the athletes and trainers received recognitions.\nDistribution and practice among sports.\nAmerican football.\n&lt;a href=\"Ron%20Rivera\"&gt;Ron Rivera&lt;/a&gt; became the first &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; player of Puerto Rican descent when he played for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s. In 1986, Rivera also became the first NFL player of Puerto Rican descent to win a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; championship ring.\nOthers who have played in the NFL are &lt;a href=\"O.J.%20Santiago\"&gt;O.J. Santiago&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Falcons\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Rivera\"&gt;Marco Rivera&lt;/a&gt; who played for the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; and who in 2002 became the first Puerto Rican to play in the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; (the first of three appearances) and &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Martinez\"&gt;Glenn Martinez&lt;/a&gt; who in 2005 played for the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Lions\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Amato\"&gt;Ken Amato&lt;/a&gt; who played for the &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Titans\"&gt;Tennessee Titans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20Pearman\"&gt;Alvin Pearman&lt;/a&gt; who played with the &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%20Jaguars\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; are of Puerto Rican descent. &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Colon%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Willie Colon&lt;/a&gt; who was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 and won &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLIII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLIII&lt;/a&gt; is also of Puerto Rican descent. &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Hernandez\"&gt;Aaron Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, was also of Puerto Rican descent. &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Cruz%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Victor Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, another player of Puerto Rican descent, played for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; and was known for his salsa touchdown dance. While all of these players are of Puerto Rican descent, there has yet to be a Puerto Rican born NFL player.\nAmerican Football has been played in the island for many decades, dating all the way back to the installment of American military bases. Puerto Rico currently has 4 football leagues. PR Pee Wee league, for children 8-16, PRHSFL, for high school students, the newly created AFAF, for college students, and PRAFL, a semi-professional league. Although football has been in the island for so many years, it is not widely known. Many things attribute to this, for example lack of proper funding and advertising, lack of high school affiliated teams, both attributing to lack of good coaching. In July 2012, the Puerto Rico American Football Federation became a member of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Federation%20of%20American%20Football\"&gt;International Federation of American Football&lt;/a&gt;.\nPee Wee Football League\nThis federation has 4 divisions, with areas in: Baldrich, Parque Central, University Gardens, Parkville, Ft. Buchanan, Carolina, and lastly Caguas. The league is played from January to March at \"El Complejo Deportivo Roberto Clemente\" in San Juan Saturday mornings. The following is a table with the years and weight distribution for each division:\nPRHSFL\nThis league has 6 Varsity teams and 3 teams at Junior Varsity level. the league is made up of 2 schools, Antilles High School Pirates, and Commonwealth Comets, and four clubs, Carolina Blittz, Bayam\u00f3n Wolfpack, University Garden Dolphins, and Parque Central Blue Wave.\nAFAF\nThis league was founded in 2009 to rival the PRAFL and to one day be a part of local college athletics. There are four teams, Cata\u00f1o Gators, San Juan Hurricanes, Carolina Blittz, and Baldrige Falcons.\nPRAFL (&lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20American%20Football%20League\"&gt;Puerto Rico American Football League&lt;/a&gt;)\nA semi-professional league founded in 1985, with 5 teams. The Bayam\u00f3n Wolfpack, Baldrich 57 Falcons, Carolina Blitzz, Cata\u00f1o Lancheros, and Fajardo Cariduros.\nThe Cata\u00f1o Lancheros were the 2011 PRAFL Champions.\nBaseball.\nEarly history of baseball in Puerto Rico.\nDuring the late 19th century Puerto Rico was to witness the introduction of organized team sports. The game of &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.\nAccording to the daily newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\", on January 11, 1898, the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.\nPuerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18. In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there.\nModern era\nPuerto Rico has over 100 &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; players who are currently active, in addition to the hundreds others who have participated in the past. These facts combine to make baseball one of the most popular sports in the island.\nSome of the most notable baseball players from Puerto Rico are five Hall of Famers &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente\"&gt;Roberto Clemente&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Cepeda\"&gt;Orlando Cepeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Alomar\"&gt;Roberto Alomar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iv%C3%A1n%20Rodr%C3%ADguez\"&gt;Iv\u00e1n \"Pudge\" Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Martinez\"&gt;Edgar Martinez&lt;/a&gt;. Another baseball player who is a Hall of Famer and who was born to a Puerto Rican father is &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Jackson\"&gt;Reginald Martinez \"Reggie\" Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. Also amongst the notable players or former players are &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Cruz\"&gt;Jose \"Cheo\" Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28baseball%20player%29\"&gt;Juan Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Pellot\"&gt;Victor Pellot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Posada\"&gt;Jorge Posada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Williams\"&gt;Bernie Williams&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronological order of major events\nCurrently.\nPuerto Rico has a winter baseball league named the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Puerto Rico Baseball League&lt;/a&gt; that has operated since the early 20th century. The champion of the Puerto Rico league represents Puerto Rico is in the annual &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20World%20Series\"&gt;Caribbean World Series&lt;/a&gt;. It currently has six teams:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20national%20baseball%20team\"&gt;Puerto Rico national baseball team&lt;/a&gt; competes in international events, including the &lt;a href=\"World%20Baseball%20Classic\"&gt;World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt;, separately from the United States. &lt;a href=\"Hiram%20Bithorn%20Stadium\"&gt;Hiram Bithorn Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in San Juan has hosted first-round games in each of the first three World Baseball Classic tournaments.\nBasketball.\nEarly history of basketball in Puerto Rico.\nThe United States military government banned cockfighting and bullfighting from the island. They did, however, introduce a \"new\" sport called basketball. Basketball was used by the American soldiers as part of their physical training. When the soldiers played basketball, they used a plain straw basket which was cut open at both ends and placed it on the highest end of a pole. For a ball, they used a football and the game was played without any established set of rules.\nIn 1913, the &lt;a href=\"YMCA\"&gt;YMCA&lt;/a&gt; of Puerto Rico organized the first game played using the official rules of basketball and in 1916, the YMCA organized the first basketball tournament in Puerto Rico. Teams organized in the other YMCAs in the island participated in the tournament. The first basketball organization in Puerto Rico was the San Juan Basketball League. &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Piedras%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;R\u00edo Piedras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bayam%C3%B3n%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Bayam\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; later followed and formed their own leagues.\nBasketball became a popular sport in Puerto Rico, due in part to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Superior%20Basketball\"&gt;BSN&lt;/a&gt;, which has been around since the 1930s. During the early 1980s, with many games shown on television, the sport's popularity increased. There is also a women's professional league, which is affiliated to the BSN. &lt;a href=\"Street%20basketball\"&gt;Street basketball&lt;/a&gt; is also popular among Puerto Rico's youth.\nChronological order of major events\nInternational Puerto Rican Basketball players.\n&lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rican%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Puerto Rico's national basketball team&lt;/a&gt; has reached the Olympic Games multiple times, including the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Athens%20Olympics\"&gt;2004 Athens Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, where they became the first team to defeat the United States &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Team%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Dream Team&lt;/a&gt; during Olympic competition. Puerto Rico's national team has won gold medals in other international competitions.\nPuerto Ricans have also been members of the &lt;a href=\"Harlem%20Globetrotters\"&gt;Harlem Globetrotters&lt;/a&gt;. In 1995, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Antigua\"&gt;Orlando Antigua&lt;/a&gt;, whose mother is Puerto Rican, became the first non-black in 52 years to play for the &lt;a href=\"Harlem%20Globetrotters\"&gt;Harlem Globetrotters&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Melendez\"&gt;Orlando Melendez&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a. \"El Gato\" became the first Puerto Rican-born player and the second Hispanic to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.\nBobsled.\nPuerto Rico had a Bobsled team in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoxing.\nEarly history of boxing in Puerto Rico.\nThe sport of &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; was also introduced by the United States military which occupied Puerto Rico and the same as Basketball, boxing was used by the American soldiers as part of their physical training. Boxing competitions amongst the soldiers were open to the public. The first boxing match in Puerto Rico was held on January 15, 1899.\nBoxing has, for many years, disputed the top spot for the Puerto Rican fan's favorite sport with Baseball and Basketball. Puerto Ricans have distinguished themselves both as amateurs and professionals.
