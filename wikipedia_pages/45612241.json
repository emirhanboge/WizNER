The film had its world premiere on 13 January 2012 and it was given a &lt;a href=\"Limited%20release\"&gt;limited theatrical release&lt;/a&gt; on 6 April 2012. \"Purification\" stars Ciminera as Bret, a ruthless &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; real-estate developer who begins to experience terrifying visions of souls trapped in limbo for the &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt;s they committed in life.\nPlot.\nBret Fitzpatrick (Joe Ciminera) is a New York real-estate developer who values his business and money over the well-being of his family and friends. Bret has had a difficult childhood and all the success he has had in his life makes him want more.\nSoon Bret has to travel back to his home town to evict Mrs. Keller (Natalie Swan) his tenant due to late rent payments. Bret arrives at Mrs. Keller's rented house and gives her 12 days time to vacate the house. Mrs. Keller agrees to vacate the premises but requests for longer time but Bret does not agree. As he leaves the premises, he is distracted by a call and nearly gets hit by a car after walking into its path.\nAfter this, Bret starts seeing dead people. He sees his dead sister and goes to a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; to consult him. The rest of the movie is about Bret coming to terms with his imminent death.\nProduction.\nFilming took place in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Long Island, New York&lt;/a&gt; from August 2011 and post-production wrapped in December 2011. Actors were not given their script and dialogue until the first day of the shoot, at which time they were assigned their roles.\nReception.\n&lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20It%20Cool%20News\"&gt;Ain't It Cool News&lt;/a&gt; gave a favorable review for \"Purification\", writing \"Decently performed and directed, yet I saw the twist from a mile away, \"PURIFICATION\" ain\u2019t all bad.\" Bryan Cain-Jackson of \"&lt;a href=\"Technorati\"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote in praise on the film, \"once in a blue moon, something truly unique comes along that will add a much welcomed shakeup to the current zeitgeist\", calling \"Purification\" \"a profoundly thought provoking film with the best examples of a Kubrickian modern horror piece and a Hitchcockian &lt;a href=\"psychological%20thriller\"&gt;psychological thriller&lt;/a&gt;\"."
