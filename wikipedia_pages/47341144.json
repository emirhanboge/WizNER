He was a stockman before joining his father at their nursery at &lt;a href=\"Newtown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Newtown&lt;/a&gt;. He established his own seed and plant business. On 19 May 1857 he married Isabella Deane, with whom he had ten children; a second marriage, around 1875 to Sarah Jane Una Barnier, produced a further seven children. He joined the Volunteer Artillery in 1861, retiring a &lt;a href=\"major%20%28rank%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in 1876.
