    "text": "Anti-flash white is a &lt;a href=\"white\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"colour\"&gt;colour&lt;/a&gt; commonly seen on &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20weapon\"&gt;nuclear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bombers\"&gt;bombers&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the colour was to reflect some of the &lt;a href=\"effects%20of%20nuclear%20explosions\"&gt;thermal radiation&lt;/a&gt; from a nuclear explosion, protecting the aircraft and its occupants.\nChina.\nSome variants of the &lt;a href=\"Xian%20H-6\"&gt;Xian H-6&lt;/a&gt; had the underside of the fuselage painted anti-flash white.\nSoviet Union/Russia/Ukraine.\nSome nuclear bombers had the underside of the fuselage painted anti-flash white with the upper surfaces painted light silver-gray. This was true for the specially fitted, single Soviet &lt;a href=\"Tupolev%20Tu-95%23Variants%20and%20derivatives\"&gt;Tu-95V&lt;/a&gt; bomber that test-deployed the most powerful bomb of any kind \u2013 the 50+ MT-rating \"&lt;a href=\"Tsar%20Bomba\"&gt;Tsar Bomba&lt;/a&gt;\" on 30 October 1961 \u2013 as it had the anti-flash white on all its undersurfaces and sides.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tupolev%20Tu-160\"&gt;Tupolev Tu-160&lt;/a&gt; of the 1980s was the first series-built Soviet/Russian bomber aircraft to be painted anti-flash white all over, leading to its \"Beliy Lebed\" (\"White Swan\") Russian nickname.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAnti-flash white was used on the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"V%20bombers\"&gt;V bombers&lt;/a&gt; force and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Buccaneer\"&gt;Blackburn Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; when used in the nuclear strike role. Nuclear bombers were given \u2013 though not at first, until the problem was considered \u2013 salmon pink and baby blue &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force%20roundels\"&gt;roundel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fin%20flash\"&gt;fin flash&lt;/a&gt; rather than the traditional dark red, white and blue.\nAnti-flash white was applied to several prototype aircraft, including the &lt;a href=\"BAC%20TSR-2\"&gt;British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2&lt;/a&gt;. Paint used on the &lt;a href=\"Avro%20Vulcan\"&gt;Avro Vulcan&lt;/a&gt; was manufactured by \"Cellon\", and that on the &lt;a href=\"Handley%20Page%20Victor\"&gt;Handley Page Victor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Titanine%20Ltd.\"&gt;Titanine Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;\nUnited States.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Air%20Command\"&gt;Strategic Air Command&lt;/a&gt; nuclear bombers carried anti-flash white without insignia on the underside of the fuselage with light silver-gray or natural metal (later light camouflage) on the upper surfaces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20A-5%20Vigilante\"&gt;A-5 Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; carried anti-flash white without insignia on the underside of the fuselage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20E-6\"&gt;Boeing E-6&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"TACAMO\"&gt;TACAMO&lt;/a&gt; role was painted anti-flash white but its roundels were not subdued.\nOther aircraft.\nIn addition to these military aircraft, &lt;a href=\"Concorde\"&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; was painted white to reduce the additional heating effect on the aluminium skin caused by the sun whilst the aircraft was flying at high altitudes, the skin temperature already being raised to over at Mach 2 by &lt;a href=\"aerodynamic%20heating\"&gt;aerodynamic heating&lt;/a&gt;.\nAircraft with at least part of the fuselage painted anti-flash white on nuclear delivery variants:"
