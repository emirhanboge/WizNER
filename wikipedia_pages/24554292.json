    "text": "Willi (Willy) Lehmann (15 March 1884, in Leipzig \u2013 13 December 1942, in Berlin) was a police official and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; agent in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nLehmann was a criminal inspector and &lt;a href=\"SS\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt;-\"&lt;a href=\"Hauptsturmf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" (captain), alias Agent A-201/Breitenbach. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; Lehmann was one of the most valuable sources for the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; in Germany.\nBiography.\nLehmann joined the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Police\"&gt;Berlin Police&lt;/a&gt; force in 1911. In 1920 he became deputy division chief of anti-espionage. In 1929 Lehmann began providing information for the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt;. He did this not out of &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; sympathy, but because he was married, also had a girlfriend, and needed money. In addition, he had a fondness for betting on horses.\nIn 1933 Lehmann joined the &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt;. The NKVD code name for the Gestapo was \"Apotheke\" (pharmacy). In the Gestapo, Lehmann became director of the division combating Soviet espionage. Thanks to Lehmann's information, the Soviets were able to free their agent &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Deutsch\"&gt;Arnold Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;, who later recruited &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Philby\"&gt;Kim Philby&lt;/a&gt;.\nLehmann joined the &lt;a href=\"SS\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; in 1934. Toward the end of June, &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring\"&gt;Hermann G\u00f6ring&lt;/a&gt; asked Lehmann to help organize the R\u00f6hm Putsch to liquidate opponents of the regime. Lehmann later told the NKVD that the murders he committed during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Long%20Knives\"&gt;Night of the Long Knives&lt;/a&gt; sickened him. But at the same time they solidified his position with his Gestapo superiors.\nIn 1939 Lehmann transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Security%20Main%20Office\"&gt;Reich Security Main Office&lt;/a&gt; (RSHA), division IV. His responsibility was to prevent the Soviets from spying on the German armaments industry. This position enabled Lehmann to provide valuable information to the Soviets about German armaments. On 19 June 1941, Lehmann reported to the NKVD the exact date on which the Germans planned to invade the Soviet Union. Operation &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt; was launched on 22 June 1941. His message was telegraphed to Beria and Stalin.\nIn 1942, with the Germans' discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Orchestra%20%28espionage%29\"&gt;Red Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, Lehmann was arrested and shot without trial on orders of &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Himmler\"&gt;Heinrich Himmler&lt;/a&gt;, who at the same time had the entire matter hushed up."
