    "text": "Zvenigorod () is an old &lt;a href=\"types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Moscow Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Population: \nHistory.\nThe town's name is based either on a personal name (cf. Zvenislav, Zvenimir) or on a hydronym (cf. the Zvinech, Zvinyaka, Zveniga Rivers); the derivation from \"town of ringing (bells)\" is a folk etymology.\nThe community has existed since the 12th century, although its first written mention is dated around 1339, in the last will of Grand Duke of Moscow &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20I%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Ivan I Daniilovich Kalita&lt;/a&gt;, in which he says: \"Thus, I pass on to my son &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20II%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt;: Zvenigorod, Kremchina, &lt;a href=\"Ruza%2C%20Ruzsky%20District%2C%20Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Ruza&lt;/a&gt;...\" In the historical records, or annals ( [letopis'] in Russian), Zvenigorod is first mentioned around 1382, soon after &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tokhtamysh\"&gt;Tokhtamysh&lt;/a&gt; burnt down Moscow, and destroyed a number of towns on the way, including Zvenigorod.\nZvenigorod rose to prominence in the late 14th century after it was bequeathed by &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Donskoy\"&gt;Dmitry Donskoy&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Yury%20of%20Zvenigorod\"&gt;second son Yuri&lt;/a&gt;, who founded his residence on the steep bank of the &lt;a href=\"Moskva%20River\"&gt;Moskva River&lt;/a&gt;. The local kremlin, called Gorodok, contains the only fully preserved example of 14th-century Muscovite architecture, the Dormition Cathedral (1399). The cathedral's interior features frescoes attributed to &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Rublev\"&gt;Andrei Rublev&lt;/a&gt;.\nZvenigorod is primarily remembered for &lt;a href=\"Muscovite%20Civil%20War\"&gt;internecine wars waged by Yuri's sons&lt;/a&gt; for control of Moscow during the reign of their cousin &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20II%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Vasily\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt; (1425\u20131462). After their party was defeated, the town was incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.\nZvenigorod was granted town rights in 1784. By the late 19th century, the town gained popularity among the &lt;a href=\"intelligentsia\"&gt;intelligentsia&lt;/a&gt; as a fashionable &lt;a href=\"banlieue\"&gt;banlieue&lt;/a&gt; of Moscow. Many extravagant &lt;a href=\"dacha\"&gt;dacha&lt;/a&gt;s were built in the neighbourhood. Some of these house museums of &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Taneyev\"&gt;Sergey Taneyev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Chekhov\"&gt;Anton Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Levitan\"&gt;Isaac Levitan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; Zvenigorod was near, or on the frontline in the 1941-2 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Battle of Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.\nSavvino-Storozhevsky Monastery.\n The &lt;a href=\"Storozhi%20Monastery\"&gt;Storozhi Monastery&lt;/a&gt; near Zvenigorod was established in 1398 by &lt;a href=\"Savva%20of%20Storozhi\"&gt;St.\u00a0Savva&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first disciples of &lt;a href=\"Sergius%20of%20Radonezh\"&gt;Sergius of Radonezh&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest church is the &lt;a href=\"katholikon\"&gt;katholikon&lt;/a&gt; completed in 1405 and dedicated to the feast of the &lt;a href=\"Nativity%20of%20the%20Theotokos\"&gt;Nativity of the Theotokos&lt;/a&gt;. In 1650, the monastery was chosen by &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Alexis&lt;/a&gt; as his suburban residence. In five years, they constructed a white-stone royal palace and a festive chamber for &lt;a href=\"tsaritsa\"&gt;tsaritsa&lt;/a&gt;. The compound was encircled with stone walls and towers, patterned after those of the &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Lavra%20of%20St.%20Sergius\"&gt;Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly noteworthy is a large belfry, erected in four bays in 1650 and crowned with three tents and a clocktower. A church over the holy gates was consecrated to the &lt;a href=\"Trinity\"&gt;Holy Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in 1652.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Feodor%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Feodor III&lt;/a&gt;, who spent most of his time there, the monastery declined. In May 1918, when the &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt;s tried to seize the relics of St.\u00a0Savva, several persons were shot dead. In 1985, the cloister was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Danilov%20Monastery\"&gt;Danilov Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow. St.\u00a0Savva's relics were returned to the monastery in 1998.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions\"&gt;framework of administrative divisions&lt;/a&gt;, it is incorporated as Zvenigorod &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20federal%20subject%20significance\"&gt;Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20divisions%20of%20Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;. As a &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions\"&gt;municipal division&lt;/a&gt;, Zvenigorod Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Zvenigorod Urban Okrug.\nSport.\nThe city has a woman's handball team &lt;a href=\"Zvezda%20Zvenigorod\"&gt;Zvezda Zvenigorod&lt;/a&gt;\",\" which won the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20EHF%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Women's EHF Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in the 2007\u201308 season.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2014 Sister cities.\nZvenigorod is &lt;a href=\"Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
