    "text": "Mansfield Rugby Club is an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; team based in &lt;a href=\"Mansfield\"&gt;Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;. The club runs four senior sides, a colts team and eleven junior sides. The first XV currently plays in &lt;a href=\"Midlands%203%20East%20%28North%29\"&gt;Midlands 3 East (North)&lt;/a&gt;, a sixth tier league in the &lt;a href=\"English%20rugby%20union%20system\"&gt;English rugby union system&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMansfield Rugby Club was formed in 1956 and by 1977 the club had bought its own ground at Eakring Road. The club was placed in &lt;a href=\"Midlands%201\"&gt;Midlands 1&lt;/a&gt; when the league system was introduced in 1987. A reorganisation of the leagues resulted in the club moving to &lt;a href=\"Midlands%202%20East\"&gt;Midlands 2 East&lt;/a&gt; but Mansfield has since gained two promotions, moving into National 3 Midlands in 2011. However recent seasons have seen several relegations and the club is now playing at a level similar to where the club was a decade earlier."
