    "text": "N. V. Krishnaiah (also known as NVK) was a &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; politician from &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. He was a municipal councillor in &lt;a href=\"Nellore\"&gt;Nellore&lt;/a&gt;, member of the Andhra Pradesh legislature, president of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Indian Federation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; and a central leader in the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20%28Kanu%20Sanyal%29\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNVK was born in 1930 in Yataluru village, &lt;a href=\"Venkatagiri\"&gt;Venkatagiri&lt;/a&gt; mandal, &lt;a href=\"Nellore%20district\"&gt;Nellore district&lt;/a&gt;. He completed high school in Venkatagiri and then moved to Nellore to join &lt;a href=\"V.R.%20College\"&gt;V.R. College&lt;/a&gt;. At V.R. College he joined the students movement and later became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1952.\nHe then returned to Venkatagiri and began to work in the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Kisan%20Sabha\"&gt;peasant front&lt;/a&gt; of the party. In 1957 he shifted his activities to Nellore and became a &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt; organizer amongst motor workers. In both cases he led militant campaigns and came into conflicts with landlords and private bus company owners.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"1964%20split%20in%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party of India was divided&lt;/a&gt;, NVK sided with the leftist tendency. He became the secretary of the Nellore town committee and a member of the Nellore district committee of the new party, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist)&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964 he was elected to the Municipal Corporation of Nellore.\nNVK contested the 1967 &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vidhan%20Sabha\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; election as a CPI(M) candidate in the Nellore constituency. He came second with 11951 votes (25.89%). He was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Bharatiya%20Jan%20Sangh\"&gt;Jan Sangh&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"M.%20R.%20Annadata\"&gt;M. R. Annadata&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, the CPI(M) in Andhra Pradesh faced another split. Large sections of the regional party cadres began to condemn the CPI(M) leadership as 'neo-revisionist'. Led by &lt;a href=\"T.N.%20Reddy\"&gt;T.N. Reddy&lt;/a&gt;, the radical elements rallied around the &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh%20Coordination%20Committee%20of%20Communist%20Revolutionaries\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt;. NVK joined the APCCCR, and as a consequence he later resigned from his position as a municipal councillor.\nNVK was one of the accused in the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case. During the period of 1968-1978, he was frequently jailed, and spent over five years in imprisonment. When the APCCCR was divided in 1971, NVK sided with the &lt;a href=\"Chandra%20Pulla%20Reddy\"&gt;Chandra Pulla Reddy&lt;/a&gt;-led faction. This grouping merged into the &lt;a href=\"PCC%2C%20CPI%28ML%29\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter being released from jail in 1978, he became involved in trade union activities. He became the president of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Indian Federation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt;. In 1980 he sided with C.P. Reddy, who broke away and formed &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20%28Chandra%20Pulla%20Reddy%29\"&gt;his own CPI(ML)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, NVK contested the &lt;a href=\"Sircilla\"&gt;Sircilla&lt;/a&gt; seat as an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;. He won with 26430 votes (29.84%). During his legislative tenure, he raised over 2500 questions in the assembly. One of the issues he highlighted was the need for irrigation in the &lt;a href=\"Karimnagar\"&gt;Karimnagar&lt;/a&gt; area.\nFollowing the 1994 Legislative Assembly election, CPI(ML) Janashakti was divided. NVK became the leader of a break-away group, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20Janashakti%20COC\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti COC&lt;/a&gt;. Later, CPI(ML) Janashakti COC would merge with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20New%20Initiative\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) New Initiative&lt;/a&gt; of Arvind Sinha and form the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20Unity%20Initiative\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Unity Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. CPI(ML) Unity Initiative then merged with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Organisation%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29\"&gt;Communist Organisation of India (Marxist-Leninist)&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kanu%20Sanyal\"&gt;Kanu Sanyal&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20%28Kanu%20Sanyal%29\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20Red%20Flag\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag&lt;/a&gt; merged into the CPI(ML) led by Sanyal, at a conference in &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada\"&gt;Vijayawada&lt;/a&gt;. NVK became a &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; member of the unified CPI(ML).\nNVK died on 13 September 2006."
