    "text": "Togus, formally known as the Togus VA Medical Center, is a facility operated by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs\"&gt;United States Department of Veterans Affairs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;. The facility was built as a resort &lt;a href=\"hotel\"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;, and housed &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"veteran\"&gt;veteran&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; prior to being converted to a &lt;a href=\"veterans%20hospital\"&gt;veterans hospital&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first veterans facility developed by the United States government.\nTogus Springs Hotel.\n&lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;Springs&lt;/a&gt; on the site were originally described by &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;s as \"worromontogus\" (sometimes translated as \"place of the mineral spring\"). The 134-room Togus Springs Hotel was built on the site in 1858 by &lt;a href=\"Rockland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Rockland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; dealer &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Beals\"&gt;Horace Beals&lt;/a&gt;. Beals constructed a stable, large pool, bathing house, race track, and bowling alley on the site in an effort to duplicate the success of the &lt;a href=\"Poland%20Spring\"&gt;Poland Spring&lt;/a&gt; Hotel. Beal's investment of one-quarter-million dollars failed to attract the anticipated number of visitors, and the facility closed when receipts failed to cover expenses.\nSoldiers' home.\nThe hotel was purchased by the federal government for &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 in 1866. Togus began operations on as the Eastern Branch of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Home%20for%20Disabled%20Volunteer%20Soldiers\"&gt;National Asylum For Disabled Volunteer Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. The first veteran admitted was &lt;a href=\"James%20P.%20Nickerson\"&gt;James P. Nickerson&lt;/a&gt; of Company A, 19th Massachusetts Volunteers. Two hundred veterans were living at Togus during the summer of 1867, and a new &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; were under construction. A fire in a main building on January 7, 1868, displaced 270 residents. Three 3-story brick dormitories and an amusement hall recreation building were built in 1868. Togus resembled a military establishment where the men wore surplus blue army &lt;a href=\"uniform\"&gt;uniform&lt;/a&gt;s and were subject to military discipline including confinement in the guardhouse for infractions of the rules. The residents signed over their federal &lt;a href=\"pension\"&gt;pension&lt;/a&gt; in return for their care.\nThose who were able to work could earn money working at the shops or farms raising much of the food consumed at Togus. Three &lt;a href=\"Holstein%20%28cattle%29\"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dairy%20cattle\"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt; were imported from the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in 1871 to form the first registered herd of the breed in Maine. In 1872 the name was changed to the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. New buildings included a &lt;a href=\"bakery\"&gt;bakery&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"butcher\"&gt;butcher&lt;/a&gt; shop, a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; shop, a &lt;a href=\"brickyard\"&gt;brickyard&lt;/a&gt;, a boot and shoe factory, a carpentry shop, a fire station, a harness shop, a &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt;, a soap works, a store, and an opera house &lt;a href=\"theatre\"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt;. President &lt;a href=\"Ulysses%20S.%20Grant\"&gt;Ulysses S. Grant&lt;/a&gt; visited Togus on August 13, 1873 to review the men who had served with him during the Civil War. There were 933 men living at Togus in 1878. Most were Civil War veterans, but some had served in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Mexican\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"narrow-gauge\"&gt;narrow-gauge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kennebec%20Central%20Railroad\"&gt;Kennebec Central Railroad&lt;/a&gt; offered transportation to &lt;a href=\"Gardiner%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Gardiner&lt;/a&gt; beginning on July 23, 1890. The &lt;a href=\"interurban\"&gt;interurban&lt;/a&gt; Augusta and Togus Electric Railway offered transportation to &lt;a href=\"Augusta%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Augusta&lt;/a&gt; beginning on June 15, 1901. The number of veterans living at Togus peaked in 1904 at just under 2800. Most men lived in dormitories, but some resided in small &lt;a href=\"cottage\"&gt;cottage&lt;/a&gt;s they constructed on the grounds. The men in cottages drew their rations from the &lt;a href=\"commissary\"&gt;commissary&lt;/a&gt; and cooked their own meals. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic\"&gt;Grand Army of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; post Cutler No. 48 was based at Togus and named for major &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Cutler\"&gt;Nathan Cutler&lt;/a&gt;. Togus became a popular recreation center for civilians from the surrounding area. Large crowds arrived on weekends to observe &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; games, &lt;a href=\"military%20band\"&gt;military band&lt;/a&gt; concerts, opera house performances, and a &lt;a href=\"zoo\"&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"antelope\"&gt;antelope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Bison\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elk\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Common%20chimpanzee\"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;s. Special military ceremonies were held on &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Day\"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flag%20Day%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Flag Day&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nVeterans Administration hospital.\nAdditional buildings were constructed to convert the site to a Veterans Administration hospital. The facilities, along with the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Togus%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Togus National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, were listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20House%20%28Togus%2C%20Maine%29\"&gt;Governor's House&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest building in the complex and the oldest veteran-related facility in the country, was designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; in 1973.\nOn July 8, 2010 a Veteran with ongoing health issues had an armed confrontation with VA police and a Maine Game Warden in a wooded area of the campus after calls were placed to authorities regarding gunshots. The Veteran was shot and killed by police."
