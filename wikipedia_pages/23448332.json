The school was originally the home of Terence Mackin who gave his home to the Dominican sisters of Nashville so that a school could be created. His sister Sister Aloysius Mackin helped with the creation of the school. In 1962 more classrooms were added to the Mackin house. A few years later it was the first private school in Birmingham to desegregate. In 1993 the gym building was built which contains three classrooms as well as a multipurpose sport court and music room. A few years later the school bought the Discovery Place building.\nCampus.\nSaint Rose Academy's campus is located just above the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Expressway%20Cut\"&gt;Red Mountain Expressway Cut&lt;/a&gt;.

The school has two playgrounds, an outdoor classroom, and a grassy lawn.\nStudents, faculty, and administration.\nSaint Rose Academy has an average class size of 22 with one class per grade.
