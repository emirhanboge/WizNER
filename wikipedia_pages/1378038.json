    "text": "Jan Dismas Zelenka (16 October 1679 \u2013 23 December 1745), baptised Jan Luk\u00e1\u0161 Zelenka and also known as Johann Dismas Zelenka or Johannes Lucas Ignatius Dismas Zelenka, was a composer and musician of the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque period&lt;/a&gt;. His music is admired for its &lt;a href=\"harmony%20%28music%29\"&gt;harmonic&lt;/a&gt; inventiveness and &lt;a href=\"counterpoint\"&gt;counterpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nZelenka was raised in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bohemia\"&gt;Central Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;, educated in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, and spent his professional life in &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest success during his career was the performance of the extensive composition \"&lt;a href=\"Sub%20olea%20pacis%20et%20palma%20virtutis\"&gt;Sub olea pacis et palma virtutis&lt;/a&gt;\" in the presence of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles VI&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after his &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20of%20the%20Bohemian%20monarch\"&gt;coronation as king of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; in 1723.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nZelenka was born in &lt;a href=\"Lou%C5%88ovice%20pod%20Blan%C3%ADkem\"&gt;Lou\u0148ovice pod Blan\u00edkem&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Launiowitz\"), a small market town southeast of &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;. He was the eldest of eight children born to Marie Magdalena (n\u00e9e H\u00e1jek) and Ji\u0159\u00ed Zelenka. The middle name &lt;a href=\"Dismas\"&gt;Dismas&lt;/a&gt; is probably his &lt;a href=\"confirmation\"&gt;confirmation&lt;/a&gt; name. Zelenka's father Ji\u0159\u00ed was a schoolmaster and organist in Lou\u0148ovice, and was likely his first music teacher. Nothing more is known with certainty about Zelenka's early years, but it is known that he received his musical training at the &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; college &lt;a href=\"Clementinum\"&gt;Clementinum&lt;/a&gt; in Prague and that his instrument was the &lt;a href=\"violone\"&gt;violone&lt;/a&gt; (bass &lt;a href=\"viol\"&gt;viol&lt;/a&gt;). His first works were probably written in Prague. His earliest known work is the school drama \"Via laureta\" (ZWV 245), composed in 1704, from which only the &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; has been preserved.\nIn 1709 in Prague, Zelenka served Baron von Johann Hubert von Hartig before his appointment as a violone player in &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;'s royal orchestra. Baron von Hartig was a well-known connoisseur of music and a virtuoso musician. He corresponded with many important Italian composers, and amassed a great music library which Zelenka would later have access to, notably including &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Lotti\"&gt;Antonio Lotti&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Missa Sapientiae\". Zelenka copied this work from Hartig's collection around 1729, and later in the 1730s &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach\"&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt; acquired a copy of it from Zelenka's library. &lt;a href=\"George%20Frideric%20Handel\"&gt;George Frideric Handel&lt;/a&gt;'s copy of the same Mass might also have been acquired through Zelenka. When Johann Hubert died in Prague in 1741, Zelenka dedicated his \"Litaniae Lauretanae 'Salus infirmorum\"' (ZWV 152) to his old patron.\nBaron von Hartig may have recommended Zelenka to the &lt;a href=\"Staatskapelle%20Dresden\"&gt;Dresden \"Hofkapelle\"&lt;/a&gt; (court orchestra) as a double bass player. In any event, he entered the service of the Dresden court with a salary of 300 thalers in 1710/11. The favorable conditions for music making there added impetus to his creativity, particularly with respect to the composition of sacred music for the Catholic court church. His first major work in Dresden was a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Missa Sanctae Caeciliae\" (c. 1711). Zelenka's music must have impressed the court, because only a few months after his arrival in Dresden his salary was increased to 350 thalers. This placed him among the most highly paid musicians in the \"Hofkapelle\". Three years later, it was raised to 400 thalers.\nVienna.\nIn 1716, Zelenka continued his education in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; Imperial &lt;a href=\"Kapellmeister\"&gt;Kapellmeister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Joseph%20Fux\"&gt;Johann Joseph Fux&lt;/a&gt;. It is unlikely that he visited &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; as once thought. A &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; court document of 1715 records a royal cash advance for a trip to Italy by Zelenka with his fellow musicians and composers Pierre (Peter) Gabriel Buffardin, Johann Christian Richter and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Georg%20Pisendel\"&gt;Johann Georg Pisendel&lt;/a&gt;. New documents confirming the arrival of the oboist Richter and violinist Pisendel in Italy have now surfaced but neither Zelenka nor Buffardin were travelling with them.\nBack in Dresden in 1719, he remained there except for an extended stay in Prague in 1722-3, when he conducted the premi\u00e8re of one of his major secular works, \"&lt;a href=\"Sub%20olea%20pacis%20et%20palma%20virtutis\"&gt;Sub olea pacis et palma virtutis conspicua orbi regia Bohemiae Corona&lt;/a&gt;\" (a &lt;a href=\"melodrama\"&gt;melodrama&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Wenceslas\"&gt;St. Wenceslas&lt;/a&gt;), at the time of the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles VI&lt;/a&gt;. While in Prague he composed some of his highly original instrumental works, as seen in the autograph of the score of \"Concerto \u00e0 8 Concertanti\" \u2014 \"Six concerti written in a hurry in Prague in 1723\" (ZWV 186, 187, 188, 189).\nIn the early 1720s, Zelenka composed some of his finest works like the \"Responsoria pro hebdomada\" (ZWV 55) and the \"Lamentations\" (ZWV 53). His compositions still constitute an important part of the repertoire of the Catholic court church. Following the frequent illnesses of \"&lt;a href=\"Kapellmeister\"&gt;Kapellmeister&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Johann%20David%20Heinichen\"&gt;Johann David Heinichen&lt;/a&gt;, Zelenka gradually took over the direction of the sacred music. In January 1726, he began entering his own works and those of others he collected into a register called \"Inventarium (1726-39)\", one of the most important documents of Dresden baroque music. In July 1729, Heinichen died and Zelenka became acting \"Kapellmeister,\" a position he occupied in an unofficial capacity until 1734. This period is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;\", a term coined by Professor Wolfgang Horn. The first work that confirms Zelenka's new status is a \"Sinfonia\" (ZWV 190, 18 May 1729, previously known as \"Capriccio\"), which, as Janice B. Stockigt has established, was performed at a \"Gala\" to celebrate the birthday of the Saxon Elector and Polish king, &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Augustus II the Strong&lt;/a&gt;. The official publication \"K\u00f6nigl. Polnischer und Churf\u00fcrstl. S\u00e4chsischer Hoff-\" \"und Staats-Calender (Hof- from 1734),\" which listed the members and servants of the Dresden court, listed Zelenka as a \"Contra-Basso\" &amp; \"Compositeur\" in the editions of 1731 and 1732; in 1733, he is listed as a \"Compositeur\" only, which suggests that he was no longer playing the double bass. Instead, he most likely directed the music in his capacity as a singer.\n1730s.\nThe period of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to a number of outlandish theories on Zelenka's position at the Dresden court, and especially around his petitions from October/November 1733 for the \"Kapellmeister\" position. The fact is that before the death of Heinichen in 1729, the Dresden court was already actively looking for a well-established opera composer to take Heinichen's place. This was a part of a long-term project to re-establish the Italian opera in Dresden. In 1724, the Dresden court began training five young Italian opera singers with some of the finest vocal teachers in Italy like &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Porpora\"&gt;Nicola Porpora&lt;/a&gt;, a great composer in his own right and future teacher of the young &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Haydn\"&gt;Joseph Haydn&lt;/a&gt;. In the first week of February 1730, the young singers, the castrato alto &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Annibali\"&gt;Domenico Annibali&lt;/a&gt;, the castrato sopranos (also called \"Porporino\"), and the sister sopranos &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.quellusignolo.fr/sopranos/negri-rosa.html\"&gt;Maria Rosa Negri and Anna Negri&lt;/a&gt; were called to Dresden. There is hardly any coincidence that in the same week, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Adolf%20Hasse\"&gt;Johann Adolf Hasse&lt;/a&gt; was offered the \"primo\" \"Kapellmeister\" position.\nFollowing the arrival of the five young singers in Dresden in April 1730, Zelenka played an important role in their continuing education. After the \"compositeur de la musique italienne\" &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Alberto%20Ristori\"&gt;Giovanni Alberto Ristori&lt;/a&gt; travelled to Moscow in the end of 1730, Zelenka, as the senior composer at the court, became responsible for supplying secular vocal music for the chamber concerts at the royal palace in Dresden. It is at this point in time when he began to assemble his fascinating collection of Italian opera and cantata scores, which partly still exists in Dresden and are individually numbered in Zelenka's own hand. This suggest that he wrote down a complete inventory of the secular works in his possession, and by referring to the numbers he assigned each work it was possible to reconstruct the now missing inventory. This included a number of arias of Hasse, who arrived in Dresden in July 1731 with his famous wife, &lt;a href=\"Faustina%20Bordoni\"&gt;Faustina Bordoni-Hasse&lt;/a&gt;, the most brilliant female singer of the Baroque era. Shortly after his arrival, Hasse was officially appointed \"Kapellmeister\" and, unrivalled and unchallenged, retained the position for the next 32 years. After the performances of his opera \"Cleofide\" in September 1731, Hasse and Faustina travelled back to Italy, but not before the future arrangements of the \"Hofkapelle\" had been decided and later put in motion. Pisendel, one of the greatest violinist of the baroque era, was officially appointed Konzertmeister. Eleven new musicians were hired for the orchestra on 28 November of the same year. On that same day, Zelenka was awarded a handsome salary increase of 37.5%, which brought his wages up to 550 thalers. This might have enabled him to purchase 24 opera arias, one duet, eight secular cantatas and two sacred motets in score from &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Vivaldi\"&gt;Antonio Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt;, music he was then able to use both in the chamber and the church.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong\"&gt;August II&lt;/a&gt; died in Warsaw on 1 February 1733, his son and successor as Saxon Elector &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20III%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Friedrich August&lt;/a&gt; moved swiftly and signed Hasse and Faustina to an extraordinary contract worth an astonishing 6,000 thalers annually, while their travel expenses were also paid for by the court. At that time, Hasse was already one of the most famous composers in Europe and it was a major coup for the Dresden court to have secured his and Faustina's services. Confirmation of Hasse's position is seen in the libretto to his Siroe which was performed in Bologna in May 1733, where the composer was awarded the title of \"Maestro di Cappella di S.A. R. l\u2019Elettore di Sassonia\". In that same month, Zelenka was also referred to as the elector's \"well-born and virtuoso \"Kapellmeister\"\" in a letter written by the Superior of the Catholic court church in Dresden.\nFollowing the election of Friedrich August as &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20III%20of%20Poland\"&gt;August III, King of Poland&lt;/a&gt; in October 1733, servants from all departments of the Dresden court sent in petitions for unpaid salaries or promotions. Zelenka was one of those who petitioned. It was only natural for the composer to wish to attain official recognition from the newly elected Polish king. The impression has often been given in the literature that Zelenka was in direct competition with Hasse for the Kapellmeister position, but this is a misunderstanding. It was very clear to Zelenka at that time that his colleague Hasse was, and would remain, senior Kapellmeister. This led the Dresden court to create the official position of church composer (essentially Vice-Kapellmeister), which Zelenka held from 1734 onwards, along with his student Tobias Buz and, from November 1736 onwards, J.S. Bach, who received a \"titular\" position.\nLater life and death.\nBach held Zelenka in high esteem, and the two composers knew each other, as evidenced by a letter of 13 January 1775 from his son &lt;a href=\"C.P.E.%20Bach\"&gt;C.P.E. Bach&lt;/a&gt; to the Bach biographer &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Nikolaus%20Forkel\"&gt;Johann Nikolaus Forkel&lt;/a&gt;. Bach was trusted enough by Zelenka for his eldest son &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Friedemann%20Bach\"&gt;Wilhelm Friedemann&lt;/a&gt; to copy out the Amen from Zelenka's third Magnificat (ZWV 108) to use in the Leipzig's St. Thomas' Church, where J. S. Bach was cantor for the last two and a half decades of his life. In addition to composing, Zelenka taught throughout his life a number of prominent musicians of his time, like &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Joachim%20Quantz\"&gt;Johann Joachim Quantz&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt; of Prussia's longtime court flautist and flute teacher) and J. G. Roellig. His close friends included eminent composers such as &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann\"&gt;Georg Philipp Telemann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Georg%20Pisendel\"&gt;Johann Georg Pisendel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvius%20Leopold%20Weiss\"&gt;Sylvius Leopold Weiss&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 23 December 1745, Zelenka died of &lt;a href=\"dropsy\"&gt;dropsy&lt;/a&gt; and was buried on Christmas Eve. He never married and had no children, and his compositions and musical estate were purchased from his beneficiaries by the Electress of Saxony and the Queen of Poland &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Josepha%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Maria Josepha of Austria&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, these were considered valuable court possessions. &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann\"&gt;Telemann&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Georg%20Pisendel\"&gt;Pisendel&lt;/a&gt;'s assistance, tried unsuccessfully to publish Zelenka's \"Responsoria.\" On 17 April 1756, he wrote that \"the complete manuscript will be at the Dresden court, kept under lock and key as something very rare.\"\nMusical style.\nZelenka's pieces are characterized by a very daring compositional structure with a highly spirited harmonic invention and complex counterpoint. His works are often virtuosic and difficult to perform, but always fresh and surprising, with sudden turns of harmony. In particular, his writing for bass instruments is far more demanding than that of other composers of his era. His instrumental works, the &lt;a href=\"trio%20sonata\"&gt;trio sonata&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"capriccio%20%28music%29\"&gt;capricci&lt;/a&gt;, and concertos are exemplary models of his early style (1710s \u20131720s). The six trio sonatas demand high virtuosity and expressive sensitivity from performers. As Zelenka was himself a violone player, he was known to write fast-moving continuo parts with driving and complicated rhythm.\nZelenka was aware of the music in different regions of Europe. He wrote complex &lt;a href=\"fugue\"&gt;fugue&lt;/a&gt;s, ornate operatic &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"galant\"&gt;galant&lt;/a&gt;-style dances, baroque &lt;a href=\"recitative\"&gt;recitative&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina\"&gt;Palestrina&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"chorale\"&gt;chorale&lt;/a&gt;s, and virtuosic concertos. Zelenka's musical language is closest to Bach's, especially in its richness of &lt;a href=\"counterpoint\"&gt;contrapuntal&lt;/a&gt; harmonies and ingenious usage of fugal themes. Nevertheless, Zelenka's language is &lt;a href=\"idiosyncrasy\"&gt;idiosyncratic&lt;/a&gt; in its unexpected harmonic twists, obsession with &lt;a href=\"chromatic\"&gt;chromatic&lt;/a&gt; harmonies, large usage of &lt;a href=\"syncopation\"&gt;syncopated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuplet\"&gt;tuplet&lt;/a&gt; figures, and unusually long phrases full of varied musical ideas. He is sometimes considered Bach's Catholic counterpart.\nZelenka's music is influenced by &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"traditional%20music\"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt;. In this respect, he continues the tradition of the production of specific Czech national music initiated by &lt;a href=\"Adam%20V%C3%A1clav%20Michna%20z%20Otradovic\"&gt;Adam Michna z Otradovic&lt;/a&gt; and brought to its culmination by &lt;a href=\"Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana\"&gt;Bed\u0159ich Smetana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k\"&gt;Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt; in the nineteenth century and &lt;a href=\"Leo%C5%A1%20Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bohuslav%20Martin%C5%AF\"&gt;Bohuslav Martin\u016f&lt;/a&gt; in the twentieth century.\nIn regards to his masses, Zelenka was not afraid to challenge the established traditions of his time. Furthermore, from his unorthodox, disjointed, and \"bizarre\" sounding fugal subjects (such as the Kyrie Eleison from ZWV 48) to his fiery orchestration, he presents fresh interpretations of established &lt;a href=\"Liturgy\"&gt;liturgical&lt;/a&gt; mass texts\nReception.\nAppreciation by his contemporaries.\nDespite his posthumous neglect, Zelenka was highly regarded during his own career and was respected by significant composers of the day, such as Telemann, Bach (as aforementioned), and &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20Graupner\"&gt;Graupner&lt;/a&gt;. His music's innovative counterpoint (such as in the \"Miserere in D Minor, ZWV 56\"), clarity, and part-writing (especially in his fugues) earned him the respect of some of the most renowned contrapuntists (composers and performers who practice the art of counterpoint).\nBetween the years 1716 and 1719, Zelenka studied under the guidance J.J. Fux, the author of \"&lt;a href=\"Gradus%20ad%20Parnassum\"&gt;Gradus ad Parnassum&lt;/a&gt;\" (1660-1741) in Vienna and accepted J.J. Quantz (1697-1773) as one of his students. Zelenka also met A. Caldara (1671-1736) as well as F.B. Conti (c.1681-1732) in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna, Austria&lt;/a&gt;.\nRediscovery.\nThe rediscovery of Jan Dismas Zelenka's work is attributed to &lt;a href=\"Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana\"&gt;Bed\u0159ich Smetana&lt;/a&gt;, who rewrote some scores from the archives in Dresden and introduced one of the composer's orchestral suites in Prague's New Town Theatre festivals in 1863.\nIt was mistakenly assumed that many of Zelenka's &lt;a href=\"autograph\"&gt;autograph&lt;/a&gt; scores were destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;firebombing of Dresden&lt;/a&gt; in February 1945. However, the scores were not kept in the &lt;a href=\"Katholische%20Hofkirche\"&gt;Katholische Hofkirche&lt;/a&gt; but in the basement of the Japanese Palace, north of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;river Elbe&lt;/a&gt;. Some are certainly missing, but this probably happened gradually \u2013 and the lost scores represent only a small proportion of his extant works.\nInterest in Zelenka's music has grown, especially since the end of the 1950s with the revival of interest in Baroque music.\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s all Zelenka's instrumental compositions and selected liturgical music were published in &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. The most important revival was demonstrated by the first presentation of selected compositions by the Czech conductor &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Munclinger\"&gt;Milan Munclinger&lt;/a&gt; and his ensemble &lt;a href=\"Ars%20Rediviva\"&gt;Ars Rediviva&lt;/a&gt;. They were three trio sonatas in 1958\u201360, Sinfonia concertante in 1963 and the exquisite interpretation of \"Lamentationes Jeremiae prophetae\" with the soloists Karl Berman, &lt;a href=\"Nedda%20Casei\"&gt;Nedda Casei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theo%20Altmeyer\"&gt;Theo Altmeyer&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. The music of Zelenka has become widely known and available since that time through &lt;a href=\"Gramophone%20record\"&gt;recordings&lt;/a&gt; and sparked the interest of other musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Holliger\"&gt;Heinz Holliger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinhard%20Goebel\"&gt;Reinhard Goebel&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore than half of Zelenka's works have now been recorded, mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Such recordings include the masses \"Missa Purificationis\", \"Missa Sanctissimae trinitatis\", \"&lt;a href=\"Missa%20Votiva\"&gt;Missa Votiva&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Missa Sancti Josephi\", and his secular works \"&lt;a href=\"Sub%20olea%20pacis%20et%20palma%20virtutis\"&gt;Sub olea pacis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20Diamante\"&gt;Il Diamante&lt;/a&gt;\", mostly performed by new Czech ensembles using original instruments and interpretational techniques of the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20era\"&gt;Baroque era&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular are &lt;a href=\"Musica%20Florea\"&gt;Musica Florea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Collegium%201704\"&gt;Collegium 1704&lt;/a&gt;, Ensemble In\u00e9gal, and &lt;a href=\"Capella%20Regia%20Musicalis\"&gt;Capella Regia Musicalis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn honor of Jan Dismas Zelenka, in 1984 \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Autumn%20Music%20Festival%20under%20Blan%C3%ADk\"&gt;The Autumn Music Festival under Blan\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"\" in Czech) was founded and commemorated with the memorial plaque on his house. Since then, performances of Zelenka's music have regularly taken place in and around his birthplace.\nSeveral analyses of the composer's sacred and instrumental compositions (particularly fugues and other counterpoint) have contributed to his popularity, due to the efforts of both &lt;a href=\"Musicology\"&gt;musicologists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;s dedicated to the dissemination of his work. The most analyzed of Zelenka's compositions are his &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;masses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"requiem\"&gt;requiem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Litany\"&gt;litanies&lt;/a&gt; and other sacred vocal compositions, which have, ever since the revival of his music, experienced a surge in reputation and veneration. According to Susanne Oschmann, \"Jan Dismas Zelenka has of late been recognized as one of the most original composers of a musical epoch that was long thought to have been shaped by Bach and Handel\", and according to &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Holliger\"&gt;Heinz Holliger&lt;/a&gt;, \"It seems essential to me, that Zelenka (like Bach) obviously has absorbed the total compositional knowledge of the previous generations, and, by virtue of his most individual personality exposes it to a breaking test, thus setting free a critical element opposing the tradition.\"\nCompositions.\nZelenka's complete compositions are listed in the digitized database of the , as well as on the \"Discover Zelenka\" website.\nThe total number of Zelenka's known and attributed &lt;a href=\"Opus%20number\"&gt;opus-numbered&lt;/a&gt; works is 249. The sacred vocal-instrumental music is at the center of his compositions and include over 20 &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es, four extensive &lt;a href=\"oratorio\"&gt;oratorio&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Music%20for%20the%20Requiem%20Mass\"&gt;requiem&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Magnificat\"&gt;Magnificat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Te%20Deum\"&gt;Te Deum&lt;/a&gt; settings, 13 &lt;a href=\"litany\"&gt;litanies&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"psalm\"&gt;psalm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hymn\"&gt;hymn&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"antiphony\"&gt;antiphons&lt;/a&gt;. Zelenka also wrote a number of purely instrumental works \u2013 six trio or quartet sonatas, five capricci, one \"Hipocondrie\" and other &lt;a href=\"concerto\"&gt;concerto&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"overture\"&gt;overture&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"symphony\"&gt;symphonie&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe most appreciated of Zelenka's sacred works are his &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;masses&lt;/a&gt;, above all his \"Missa Purificationis\" (ZWV 16, his last mass to include brass instruments) and his final five pieces (ZWV 17\u201321), commonly called \"High Mass\" compositions, written between 1736 and 1741 and considered as Zelenka's compositional peak. The last three were also called \"Missae ultimae\" (Last Masses)."
