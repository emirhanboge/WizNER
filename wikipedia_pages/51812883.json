It was designed by architect &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Todd\"&gt;Frederick Todd&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt takes its name from an old &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt; dam discovered during the work.\nDescription.\nAbout by , Beaver Lake is shaped like a four-leafed clover. It was traditionally used an outdoor rink in winter, but this practice was ended in 2017 and skating now takes place on an artificial rink nearby.\nThe surroundings of the lake are equipped for various recreational activities: skating and sliding in the winter, vast lawns in summer.\nHistory.\nThe Beaver Lake pavilion.\nBuilt between 1956 and 1958, inaugurated in 1961, the pavilion is located west of the lake. Designed by architects Hazen Sise and Guy Desbarats of montreal-based architectural firm &lt;a href=\"Arcop\"&gt;Arcop&lt;/a&gt;, it was considered one of the most innovative buildings in Montreal, with a corrugated roof and large windows. It was renovated in 2005-2007.\nThe pavilion houses a restaurant named \"The Pavilion\".\nIn 2007, the &lt;a href=\"Ordre%20des%20architectes%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec\"&gt;Ordre des architectes du Qu\u00e9bec&lt;/a&gt; (Order of Architects of Quebec) awarded the Excellence Award in architecture to architects Pierina Saia and R\u00e9al Paul and to the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Montreal\"&gt;City of Montreal&lt;/a&gt; for the conservation and heritage restoration of the Beaver Lake pavilion."
