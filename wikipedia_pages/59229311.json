    "text": "Megorashim ( \"expelled\") is a term used to refer to &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; who arrived in &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%201391\"&gt;anti-Jewish persecutions of 1391&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"expulsion%20of%20Jews%20from%20Spain\"&gt;expulsion of Jews from Spain&lt;/a&gt; in 1492. These migrants were distinct from pre-existing North African Jews called &lt;a href=\"Toshavim\"&gt;Toshavim&lt;/a&gt;. The Toshavim had been present in North Africa since ancient times, spoke the local languages (&lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Berber&lt;/a&gt;), and had traditions that were influenced by Maghrebi &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. The Megorashim influenced North African Judaism, incorporating traditions from Spain. They eventually merged with the Toshavim, so that it is now difficult to distinguish between the two groups. The Jews of North Africa are often referred to as &lt;a href=\"Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardi&lt;/a&gt;, a term that emphasizes their &lt;a href=\"Iberians\"&gt;Iberian&lt;/a&gt; roots and Iberian traditions.\nMigrations.\nThe first migration took place following the persecutions of 1391 in &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valencia\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Many Megorashim took refuge along the North African coast, especially in &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;. Among them were prestigious rabbis like &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20ben%20Sheshet\"&gt;Isaac ben Sheshet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20ben%20Zemah%20Duran\"&gt;Simeon ben Zemah Duran&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 40,000 to 70,000 Jews who left Spain in 1492 following the Alhambra decree, the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; estimates that 32,000 reached the coast of North Africa; (20,000 in Morocco, 10,000 in Algeria). Others say, however, that it is impossible to really estimate how many Iberian Jews found refuge in &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maghreb\"&gt;Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommunities.\nThese Jews had their own leaders, &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;s and spiritual leaders as well as their own &lt;a href=\"minhag\"&gt;minhag&lt;/a&gt;. They spoke the different languages of the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; from which they originated (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Castilian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aragonese%20language\"&gt;Aragonese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20language\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galician%20language\"&gt;Galician&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and a standardized Judeo-Spanish form, called &lt;a href=\"Judaeo-Spanish\"&gt;Judezmo&lt;/a&gt;, has long been used by the diaspora.\nAfter 1391, the Megorashim had settled mainly in &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; and its adjacent cities, &lt;a href=\"Tlemcen\"&gt;Tlemcen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oran\"&gt;Oran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A9n%C3%A8s\"&gt;T\u00e9n\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9ja%C3%AFa\"&gt;B\u00e9ja\u00efa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantine%2C%20Algeria\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Meknes\"&gt;Meknes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fez%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Debdou\"&gt;Debdou&lt;/a&gt;, with the capture of &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;). Following the &lt;a href=\"Alhambra%20Decree\"&gt;expulsion edict of 1492&lt;/a&gt;, new waves of Megorashim came to North Africa, specifically &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A9touan\"&gt;Tetouan&lt;/a&gt;, Fez, Meknes, &lt;a href=\"Rabat\"&gt;Rabat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sal%C3%A9\"&gt;Sale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marrakesh\"&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/a&gt;. They then moved to &lt;a href=\"Essaouira\"&gt;Mogador&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Alaouite%20dynasty\"&gt;Alaouite&lt;/a&gt; King Mohammed bin Abdullah invited the Jews to settle there and take care of relations with &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn most of the communities where they settled, the Megorashim imposed their rabbis and their reforms, eventually merging with local Jews (the Toshavim). They were at the origin of the revival of Maghreb Judaism strongly weakened by &lt;a href=\"Almohade\"&gt;Almohade&lt;/a&gt; persecution. The arrival of Rabbi &lt;a href=\"Ephraim%20Alnaqua\"&gt;Ephraim Alnaqua&lt;/a&gt; of Seville at the end of 1391 in Tlemcen allowed Jews settled in the neighboring towns of &lt;a href=\"Honaine\"&gt;Honaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agadir\"&gt;Agadir&lt;/a&gt; to settle in the city itself. In Tetouan, where they formed the main Jewish component of the city, the Megorashim imposed their Judeo-Spanish language known as &lt;a href=\"Haketia\"&gt;Haketia&lt;/a&gt;. In Algiers in the 15th century, the Jews were classified in several categories: those native to Africa, those coming from the &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 16th Century, Spanish attacks on the shores of Algeria and &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; often pushed the Jews to abandon the coast for the interior of the land. This provoked several times the expulsion of Jews from the city of Oran and the destruction of B\u00e9ja\u00efa and Algiers. The defeat of the Spanish on the taking of the city was famous by the Jewish community during the Purim of Algiers. With the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20protectorate%20in%20Morocco\"&gt;Spanish protectorate in northern Morocco&lt;/a&gt; from the 19th Century, we are witnessing the first reconciliation between &lt;a href=\"Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spaniards\"&gt;Spaniards&lt;/a&gt;, and many Jews from Tetuan settled in &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;, Spain, and &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; at the same time.\nIn Mogador and along the Atlantic coast, Jews are generally heavily involved in trade between Morocco and Portugal. Within the regency of Algiers and Tunis the trade with Europe and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; was often the fact of the Megorashim, especially the Grana of &lt;a href=\"Livorno\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; who had settled there since the 16th Century.\nMegorashim relations with, and influence over, the Toshavim varies widely among the communities in which they settled. This European influence on the local way of life tended to ignore the population living on the edge of urban centers, or even provoked a hostile reaction."
