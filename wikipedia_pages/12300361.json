As of April 1, 2017, the city has an estimated &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; of 44,498, with 18,119 &lt;a href=\"household\"&gt;household&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; of 210 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 209.43\u00a0km\u00b2.\nThe modern city of Akaiwa was established on March 7, 2005, from the merger of the towns of &lt;a href=\"Akasaka%2C%20Okayama\"&gt;Akasaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kumayama%2C%20Okayama\"&gt;Kumayama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%27y%C5%8D%2C%20Okayama\"&gt;San'y\u014d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yoshii%2C%20Okayama%20%28Akaiwa%29\"&gt;Yoshii&lt;/a&gt; (all from &lt;a href=\"Akaiwa%20District%2C%20Okayama\"&gt;Akaiwa District&lt;/a&gt;).\nAkaiwa is one of three remaining places in Japan that produces the &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; stalk for \"fude\" &lt;a href=\"ink%20brush\"&gt;ink brush&lt;/a&gt;es. The harvested bamboo stalks are spread in the dry riverbed of the &lt;a href=\"Yoshii%20River\"&gt;Yoshii River&lt;/a&gt; during the winter to dry under the sun. The stalks are then boiled in the town to remove impurities.\nAkaiwa is home to the Kumayama Archeological Site. The site was utilized as a sacred spot as early as the &lt;a href=\"Yayoi%20period\"&gt;Yayoi period&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20temple\"&gt;Buddhist temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reizan-ji\"&gt;Reizan-ji&lt;/a&gt;, was active on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kuma%20%28Okayama%29\"&gt;Mount Kuma&lt;/a&gt; () from the early &lt;a href=\"Nara%20period\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Muromachi%20period\"&gt;Muromachi period&lt;/a&gt;. A stone base remains on the site, and is protected by the Japanese government. The stone base originally supported a large Buddhist statue."
