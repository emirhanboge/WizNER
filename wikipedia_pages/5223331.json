    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;European Rugby Champions Cup&lt;/a&gt; is an annual &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition for European clubs whose countries compete in the &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced in 2014, the competition replaced the Heineken Cup, which had been run by &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Cup\"&gt;European Rugby Cup&lt;/a&gt; (ERC) since 1995, following &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup%23Disagreements%20over%20structure%20%26amp%3B%20governance\"&gt;disagreements&lt;/a&gt; between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition.\nIt is organised by &lt;a href=\"European%20Professional%20Club%20Rugby\"&gt;European Professional Club Rugby&lt;/a&gt; (EPCR), with teams qualifying via their final positions in their respective national/cross-border leagues (&lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Top%2014\"&gt;Top 14&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pro14\"&gt;Pro14&lt;/a&gt;). The winners of the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;first final&lt;/a&gt; were French team &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Toulousain\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, who beat Welsh side &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20RFC\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; 21\u201318 after &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Rugby%20union\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;.\n20 teams initially compete in five separate pools. The top eight teams from the pools progress to the knockout stage. If the score in a knockout match is a &lt;a href=\"Tie%20%28draw%29\"&gt;draw&lt;/a&gt; after 80 minutes of regular play, an additional 20-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If the score remains tied, an additional 10 minutes of &lt;a href=\"Sudden%20death%20%28sport%29\"&gt;sudden-death&lt;/a&gt; extra time are played, with the first team to score points immediately declared the winner. If no team is able to break the tie during extra time, the winner is ultimately decided by a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout%23Rugby%20union\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt;. As well as the first final, the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Heineken%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2005 final&lt;/a&gt; between French teams Toulouse and &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; went to extra time, which Toulouse won 18\u201312.\nToulouse are the most successful team in the history of the tournament, with five wins. &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; have won the competition four times, while &lt;a href=\"RC%20Toulonnais\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saracens%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Saracens&lt;/a&gt; are third with three wins. Toulon are the only team to have won three consecutive tournaments, from 2013 to 2015. Three teams have played in more than one final and failed to win any of them \u2013 Clermont three times, Racing 92, Stade Fran\u00e7ais and &lt;a href=\"Biarritz%20Olympique\"&gt;Biarritz&lt;/a&gt; twice. No teams from Scotland and Italy have progressed to the final.\nThe 2017\u201318 final was held in &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first time that the final was contested in a country without a team participating in the competition. The 2020\u201321 final was relocated from &lt;a href=\"Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. and the 2021\u201322 final will be held in Marseille instead."
