    "text": "The Ava 4A was a low power &lt;a href=\"flat-four\"&gt;flat-four&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"boxer%20engine\"&gt;boxer engine&lt;/a&gt;) developed for very light aircraft in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s. It was used by several prototypes and at least one production series.\nDesign and development.\nMarcel Violet was a French racing driver who designed his own two-cylinder, &lt;a href=\"two-stroke%20engine\"&gt;two-stroke engine&lt;/a&gt;s. He also designed a two stroke &lt;a href=\"horizontally%20opposed\"&gt;horizontally opposed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flat-four\"&gt;flat-four&lt;/a&gt;, which was built under licence at \"L'agence general moteurs \"Ava\"\" by Jean Aubry of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 J. Thibault, G Aubry et Cie\", alloy metal specialists, as the Ava 4A. It only produced and was intended to power small, low cost, single seat aircraft, replacing the aging &lt;a href=\"Anzani\"&gt;Anzani&lt;/a&gt;s and completing with the French &lt;a href=\"Mengin%20Type%20B\"&gt;Mengin Type B&lt;/a&gt; and the older &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Cherub\"&gt;Bristol Cherub&lt;/a&gt; engines.\nThe Ava 4A was on display at the November 1936 Paris Salon. It powered several prototypes and also the forty-six examples of the series production variant of the &lt;a href=\"Farman%20Moustique\"&gt;Farman Moustique&lt;/a&gt;, the F.451.\nSurvivors.\nA 4A-00 survives in a private collection and is sometimes exhibited on loan."
