    "text": "Presidential elections were held in &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; on 26 May 2021, with expatriates able to vote in some embassies abroad on 20 May. The three candidates were incumbent president &lt;a href=\"Bashar%20al-Assad\"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud%20Ahmad%20Marei\"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmad Marei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20Sallum%20Abdullah\"&gt;Abdullah Sallum Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;. The elections occurred under the authoritarian regime of al-Assad and were considered not to be free and fair.\nPrior to the election, several countries and intergovernmental organisations expressed concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the election, and stated they would not recognize the results. In what was considered by some international observers to be a foregone conclusion and by many as an \"empty election\" marked by &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20fraud\"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, the result was a &lt;a href=\"landslide%20victory\"&gt;landslide victory&lt;/a&gt; for Assad, who won over 95% of the vote.\nOfficials said 78.6% of voters took part, but in the context of the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20of%20the%20Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;population displacement&lt;/a&gt;, this figure has been questioned. The government claimed over 18,000,000 \"eligible\" voters, but because ballots were only offered in areas under government control, only just over 10,000,000 were actually able to vote, while, according to the official results, Assad won over 13,000,000 votes. However, many observers and analysts noted that these numbers exceeded the possible number of adult voters in government-held areas of the country. President al-Assad was sworn-in for his fourth term (2021\u20132028) on 17 July 2021 at the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Palace%2C%20Damascus\"&gt;Presidential Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was the last election to be contested by al-Assad under Chapter three, Article 88 of the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Constitution\"&gt;Syrian Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which only allows for a maximum of one re-election.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Bashar%20al-Assad\"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, the 19th &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Syria\"&gt;President of Syria&lt;/a&gt;, took power in a &lt;a href=\"2000%20Syrian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;referendum in 2000&lt;/a&gt; following the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Hafez%20al-Assad\"&gt;Hafez al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, who had ruled Syria for 30 years. Assad also inherited the role of leader of the ruling party: the &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Command%20of%20the%20Arab%20Socialist%20Ba%27ath%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Syria%20Region\"&gt;Regional Secretary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Socialist%20Ba%27ath%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Syria%20Region\"&gt;Syrian Regional Branch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Socialist%20Ba%27ath%20Party\"&gt;Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party&lt;/a&gt;. He received 97.29% and 97.6% support, respectively, in the uncontested and undemocratic 2000 and &lt;a href=\"2007%20Syrian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2007 elections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"2014%20Syrian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;On 16 July 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after another non-democratic, but this time multi-candidate, election where he received 88.7% of the vote. The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;ongoing civil war&lt;/a&gt; and was criticised by the &lt;a href=\"UN\"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2021 election takes place as the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;Syrian civil war&lt;/a&gt; enters the eleventh year of conflict and as a result the country still remains divided among various factions. The pre-war citizen population was over 21 million. As of 2020, Syria remains the largest source country of &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20of%20the%20Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; with 6.6\u00a0million refugees having fled the nation since the start of the conflict. Additionally, seven million Syrians are &lt;a href=\"Internally%20displaced%20persons%20in%20Syria\"&gt;internally displaced&lt;/a&gt;, including 4.4 million in &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20opposition\"&gt;rebel&lt;/a&gt;-held territory, and two to four million) live in the Kurdish-ruled &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20Administration%20of%20North%20and%20East%20Syria\"&gt;Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria&lt;/a&gt; - see &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Demographics of Syria&lt;/a&gt; - while over 100,000 citizens are detained as political prisoners. The election is held only in government-held territory. According to &lt;a href=\"TRT%20World\"&gt;TRT World&lt;/a&gt;, 5-6 million adults live in areas under government control, while the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Observatory%20for%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Syrian Observatory for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (SOHR) estimates 10.9 million adults and children. According to SOHR, only five million people participated in the election, some coerced into doing so. Interior minister &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Khaled%20al-Rahmoun\"&gt;Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun&lt;/a&gt; said that 18 million Syrians are eligible to vote.\nThe vote took place despite a 2015 &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; resolution calling for a new constitution ahead of elections.\nAnalysts said the elections were held so that the government and its backer &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; could claim victory in the war, to rehabilitate the country's reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20League\"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt;, and to demonstrate that Syria is a safe country for &lt;a href=\"refoulement\"&gt;refugees to return to&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour hundred civil servants, judges, lawyers and journalists detained in a crackdown early in the year on social media dissent under &lt;a href=\"cybercrime\"&gt;cybercrime&lt;/a&gt; laws were granted an amnesty on May in advance of the election, along with thousands freed under a general amnesty for currency speculators, drug dealers, smugglers and kidnappers. Most of the freed critics were on the government side in the Civil War, and the amnesty excluded tens of thousands of Assad political detainees.\nThe election was also held in the context of a severe economic crisis. The government took a series of steps in the weeks before the vote to influence public opinion, including attempts to reduce &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; and to extend government grants to state employees in areas experiencing economic hardship.\nElectoral system.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Constitution of Syria&lt;/a&gt; approved in 2012 states that:\n\"Voters shall be the citizens who have completed eighteen years of age and met the conditions stipulated in the Election Law.\" (Article 59)\nThe Election Law shall include the provisions that ensure: (Article 61)\nSelection of candidates.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Assembly%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Assembly%20of%20Syria\"&gt;People's Assembly of Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammouda%20Sabbagh\"&gt;Hammouda Sabbagh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Arab%20Socialist%20Ba%27ath%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Syria%20Region\"&gt;Ba'ath Party&lt;/a&gt;), announced the commencement of candidacy for Presidential elections, starting from Monday 19 April. In his speech at the first session of the second extraordinary round of the People\u2019s Assembly, Sabbagh called on those who wish to run to submit their candidacy applications to the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Syria\"&gt;Supreme Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt; within a period of 10 days until Wednesday 28 April.\nRequirements for a presidential candidate.\nAccording to Law No. 5 of the year 2014 of the general elections code, The 5th chapter - article No. 30, the candidate for the post of President of the Syrian Arab Republic must:\nFurther eligibility requirements in the Constitution include: \nThe requirement for candidates to be backed by 35 members of parliament gives power to the ruling &lt;a href=\"National%20Progressive%20Front%20%28Syria%29\"&gt;National Progressive Front&lt;/a&gt;, which dominates the assembly, and the requirement to have lived continuously in Syria for the past 10 years excludes opposition figures in exile.\nCandidates.\nOn 3 May, the Syrian Supreme Constitutional Court announced that three candidates had been accepted, with the others rejected for not meeting the constitutional and legal conditions:\nAccording to the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Few consider former state minister Abdallah Salloum Abdallah and Mahmoud Merhi, a member of the so-called \"tolerated opposition\", serious contenders.\"\nUnsuccessful candidates.\nCandidates reported to have put themselves forward included:\nCampaign.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Druze\"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt;-majority &lt;a href=\"Sweida\"&gt;Sweida&lt;/a&gt; in south-west Syria, election billboards were torn and splashed with red paint within hours.\nElections.\nPrior to the elections, a Supreme Electoral Committee was formed.\nExpatriates.\nExpatriate voting occurred on 20 May in countries where it was allowed. One requirement for voting is a valid Syrian passport with an exit stamp issued by an official border crossing, which excludes many who fled the war. The &lt;a href=\"Embassy%20of%20Syria%20in%20Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Embassy of Syria in Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt; was the first embassy that started the election process.\nThe following countries have allowed Syrian citizens to vote:\nThe following eight countries did not allow expatriate voting to be held in the Syrian diplomatic missions:\nIn Lebanon, thousands were bussed to the embassy outside &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; to vote. Lebanese security forces struggled to control the crowd. Many voters carried portraits of Assad and chanted pro-Assad slogans, and the embassy played pro-Assad music. There were violent attacks on Syrian voters by Lebanese people. It was estimated that 50,000 of the 1.2 million Syrians in Lebanon voted.\nOnly a few hundred out of the 1.3 million Syrians in &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; voted in the presidential election.\nAccording to the state news agency, on 23 May, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, &lt;a href=\"Faisal%20Mekdad\"&gt;Faisal Mekdad&lt;/a&gt;, handed over the results of counting the votes of the Syrian voters residing abroad to the Minister of Justice, &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Al-Sayed\"&gt;Ahmed Al-Sayed&lt;/a&gt;, and to the Supreme Judicial Committee for Elections. He described the vote as peaceful and democratic, with the exception of Lebanon, and some Western states, where some voters were prevented from participating, and stated that these results would be included in the total and published together with them.\nIn Syria.\nThe elections were held in the country on 26 May, from 7 am to 7 pm, later extended until 12 am. Banners of the incumbent president were hung on the 12,000 polling stations across the country.\nAlthough the government reported that 14 million citizens voted, SOHR estimated the real number was closer to five million.\nPresident Assad publicly cast his ballot in the former rebel stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Douma%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Douma&lt;/a&gt;, site of a &lt;a href=\"Douma%20chemical%20attack\"&gt;suspected chemical weapons attack&lt;/a&gt; by his forces in 2018.\nThe elections were not held in the predominantly &lt;a href=\"Kurds\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20Administration%20of%20North%20and%20East%20Syria\"&gt;Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria&lt;/a&gt;, apart from ballot boxes in military zones controlled by the government in &lt;a href=\"Hasakah\"&gt;Hasakah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qamishli\"&gt;Qamishli&lt;/a&gt;, or in the opposition-held Northwest, which together make up a third of the country. Authorities in the Autonomous Administration closed the border to all vehicles except ambulances to prevent residents from travelling to government areas to vote. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Sabah\"&gt;Daily Sabah&lt;/a&gt;\", tribes in &lt;a href=\"Daraa\"&gt;Daraa&lt;/a&gt;, in Syria's south, also declared the election illegitimate, and hundreds of people there protested against the vote.\nVideo footage showed polling officials casting votes on citizens' behalf before handing back ID cards. A student in Damascus told &lt;a href=\"Al-Jazeera\"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; that \u201cSome universities will fail or even expel you if you don\u2019t vote\" and state employees were instructed to vote by the security apparatus. Many voters pricked their fingers to sign their support for Assad in blood. Pro-government &lt;a href=\"Shabiha\"&gt;shabiha militias&lt;/a&gt; controlled the process in voting centers. Ibrahim al Jibawi, opposition representative in the Constitutional Committee in Geneva, declared that there were militia members that voted more than once.\nProtests were held against the elections in &lt;a href=\"Daraa\"&gt;Daraa&lt;/a&gt;, where in response polling stations were reportedly shut down, and &lt;a href=\"Suweida\"&gt;Suweida&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational observers.\nAccording to the state news agency, the People's Assembly voted to invite representatives of the parliaments of the following countries to monitor and supervise the electoral process: &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauritania\"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. Observers from Belarus arrived on 23 May.\nRussian observers were shown on Syrian state TV station &lt;a href=\"SANA\"&gt;SANA&lt;/a&gt;, watching voters casting ballots without any privacy."
