Its &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; and most populous city is &lt;a href=\"Junction%20City%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Junction City&lt;/a&gt;. The county is named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Kansas\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Geary\"&gt;John W. Geary&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nFor many &lt;a href=\"millennia\"&gt;millennia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"nomadic\"&gt;nomadic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;. From the 16th century to 18th century, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;Kingdom of France&lt;/a&gt; claimed ownership of large parts of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. In 1762, after the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20War\"&gt;French and Indian War&lt;/a&gt;, France secretly ceded &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, per the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fontainebleau%20%281762%29\"&gt;Treaty of Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century.\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Kansas\"&gt;modern day Kansas&lt;/a&gt; was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20Purchase\"&gt;Louisiana Purchase&lt;/a&gt; for 2.83 &lt;a href=\"Penny%20%28United%20States%20coin%29\"&gt;cents&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1854, the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Territory\"&gt;Kansas Territory&lt;/a&gt; was organized, then in 1861 &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; became the 34th &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt;.

During the American Civil War, when Davis became president of the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, attempts were made to change the county's name, but both failed. Federal and state census records show it as Davis County from 1860 through 1885. In 1888 the county was renamed in honor of &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Geary\"&gt;John W.
