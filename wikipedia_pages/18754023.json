    "text": "Elections were held in the &lt;a href=\"States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; on 21 October 1914 to elect 50 members to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Western Australian Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28Western%20Australian%20Branch%29\"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party, led by &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Scaddan\"&gt;John Scaddan&lt;/a&gt;, retained government against the opposition &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Liberal%20Party%20%281911%E2%80%931917%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Opposition Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Wilson%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Frank Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, though with only the barest of majorities. The election also saw the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28WA%29\"&gt;Western Australian Country Party&lt;/a&gt;, which had been formed at a conference of the Farmers and Settlers Association the previous year to fight for rural interests, and won eight seats at the election.\nThe fragility of the Labor Party's majority was demonstrated when, a year later, Labor member &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Gardiner%20%28Western%20Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;Joseph Gardiner&lt;/a&gt;'s seat was declared vacant on account of his non-attendance and a Liberal was elected in his stead, and Labor became a minority government when on 18 December 1915, &lt;a href=\"Bertie%20Johnston\"&gt;Bertie Johnston&lt;/a&gt; resigned from the Labor Party and became an independent. On 27 July 1916, the &lt;a href=\"Scaddan%20Ministry\"&gt;Scaddan Ministry&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and Wilson became the new Premier.\nResults.\nNotes:"
