    "text": "Racing stripes, also called &lt;a href=\"24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; stripes or &lt;a href=\"Rallying\"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; stripes, were originally applied to &lt;a href=\"racecars\"&gt;racecars&lt;/a&gt; to help identify them in the field during races. The term \"racing stripe\" is also used to refer to diagonal lines painted on watercraft &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hulls&lt;/a&gt;, usually on vessels belonging to a country's &lt;a href=\"coast%20guard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacing cars.\nRacing stripes were applied to the &lt;a href=\"Briggs%20Cunningham\"&gt;Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; team's racecars beginning in 1951. Usually two parallel blue stripes running from front to rear in the centre of the white body, they helped spectators identify the cars during races. These evolved from the traditional &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile\"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt;-registered American &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20international%20auto%20racing%20colours\"&gt;racing colours&lt;/a&gt; of a white body and blue chassis, which dated from when racing cars had the chassis exposed. The two blue stripes were a symbolic echo of the chassis colours.\nIn 1964, the &lt;a href=\"Shelby%20Daytona\"&gt;Shelby Daytona Coupe&lt;/a&gt; would use the converse blue with white stripes and would compete in the 1964 and 1965 &lt;a href=\"24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans\"&gt;24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoad cars and \"go-faster stripes\".\nThe first road car to implement racing stripes was the 1965 Ford &lt;a href=\"Shelby%20Mustang\"&gt;Mustang GT350&lt;/a&gt;. From the 1960s, stripes have sometimes been applied to road cars as well as racing cars. Such cars as the &lt;a href=\"Renault%208\"&gt;Renault 8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gordini\"&gt;Gordini&lt;/a&gt; had stripes fitted as standard. They are sometimes referred to as \"go-faster stripes\" on road cars.\nAn alternative style features stripes which wrap around the car sideways instead of running down the center of the vehicle, called \"&lt;a href=\"bumblebee\"&gt;bumblebee&lt;/a&gt; stripes\". These stripes were featured prominently on the &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20Charger%20Daytona\"&gt;Dodge Charger Daytona&lt;/a&gt; racecar. Dodge's \"Scat Pack\" performance package for 1968-1971 muscle cars featured the bumblebee stripe as a signature.\nIn 1996, a pair of 8-inch wide stripes were used on the &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20Viper\"&gt;Dodge Viper&lt;/a&gt; GTS, starting a revival of the fashion. Since then, they have often been referred to as \"Viper Stripes\".\nUse on watercraft.\nMany &lt;a href=\"coast%20guard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt;-type organizations have diagonally-slanted lines on their vessels' hulls, which are referred to as \"racing stripes\". An example is the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%23Service%20Mark%20%28%26quot%3BRacing%20Stripe%26quot%3B%29\"&gt;service mark&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;."
