    "text": "Paul Smith Callaway, (August 16, 1909 \u2013 March 21, 1995) was a prominent &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"organist\"&gt;organist&lt;/a&gt; and choral conductor, particularly well known for his thirty-eight years at the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20National%20Cathedral\"&gt;Washington National Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, between 1939\u20131977. A friend of &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Bernstein\"&gt;Leonard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Rorem\"&gt;Ned Rorem&lt;/a&gt;, he was also active in &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; and a frequent guest conductor of the Lake George Opera Company (now Saratoga Opera) and was the founding musical director of the Opera Society of Washington in 1956, now the renowned &lt;a href=\"Washington%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Washington National Opera&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of his death in 1995, he was acclaimed for his great influence on the musical life of the nation's capital. In 1977, Callaway was appointed an &lt;a href=\"Honorary%20Officer%20of%20The%20Most%20Excellent%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;Honorary Officer of The Order of the British Empire (OBE)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Investiture%23Government\"&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; by Ambassador &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Jay%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Peter Jay&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years and education.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Atlanta, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, in 1909, Callaway attended &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20College%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Westminster College, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently studied organ with &lt;a href=\"T.%20Tertius%20Noble\"&gt;T. Tertius Noble&lt;/a&gt; (1930\u20131935), followed by studies with &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Sowerby\"&gt;Leo Sowerby&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"American%20Conservatory%20of%20Music\"&gt;American Conservatory of Music&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago and then &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Dupr%C3%A9\"&gt;Marcel Dupr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. While pursuing his advanced studies, Callaway was organist and choirmaster at St. Thomas Chapel in New York (1930\u20131935) and later St. Mark's Episcopal Church in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Grand Rapids, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; (1935\u20131939).\nAt Washington National Cathedral.\nOn September 1, 1939, Callaway became organist and choirmaster at the Washington National Cathedral, where he founded the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Choral%20Society\"&gt;Cathedral Choral Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1941. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Callaway was drafted into the Army as a &lt;a href=\"bandmaster\"&gt;bandmaster&lt;/a&gt; in the South Pacific., returning in May 1946. During his tenure at the Cathedral, Callaway expanded the music program's support of American &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20music\"&gt;liturgical music&lt;/a&gt; and also oversaw considerable expansion of the organ in the 1950s\u20131970s as construction of the Cathedral's &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; was completed. He was quite short in stature, necessitating the installation of a custom-made adjustable &lt;a href=\"Pedal%20keyboard\"&gt;pedalboard&lt;/a&gt; operated hydraulically so that the diminutive organist could comfortably reach the pedals of the Washington Cathedral's organ.\nNotable appearances.\nIn addition to his principal duties at the Cathedral, Callaway frequently served as a guest conductor at prominent venues. He was a guest conductor of Washington's &lt;a href=\"National%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; and also conducted the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Carlo%20Menotti\"&gt;Gian Carlo Menotti&lt;/a&gt;'s ballet, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Unicorn%2C%20the%20Gorgon%2C%20and%20the%20Manticore\"&gt;The Unicorn, the Gorgon, and the Manticore&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1956. At New York City's &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20Church\"&gt;Riverside Church&lt;/a&gt; in December 1962, he conducted the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"John%20La%20Montaine\"&gt;John La Montaine&lt;/a&gt;'s religious opera \"Novellis Novellis\" about the &lt;a href=\"Annunciation\"&gt;Annunciation&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther La Montaine operas conducted by Callaway at their world premiers were \"The Shephardes Playe\" and \"Play of Herode\". Callaway was the founding music director of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Washington National Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1956. He played the solo organ part in the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Barber\"&gt;Samuel Barber&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Toccata Festiva\" in 1960 with the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Orchestra\"&gt;Philadelphia Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Ormandy\"&gt;Eugene Ormandy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 17, 1966, Callaway directed the 51-voice choir of the Washington National Cathedral at &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in London. It was the first time an American choral group had sung there and an American flag was raised outside the Abbey for the occasion.\nWorks.\nCallaway's works include \"The Great Organ of Washington Cathedral\", recorded in 1974, \"An hymne of heavenly love\", composed in the late-1930s while at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids., and \"Hark! the Glad Sound!\" composed in December 1944 for the Cathedral Choral Society.\nRetirement and death.\nUpon Callaway's retirement as the Cathedral's third organist and choirmaster in 1977, he was succeeded by assistant organist &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wayne%20Dirksen\"&gt;Richard Wayne Dirksen&lt;/a&gt;, the Canon Precentor. &lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;\"Washington Post\"&lt;/a&gt; music critic &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Hume\"&gt;Paul Hume&lt;/a&gt; said of Callaway at the time, \"It seems incontrovertible that he has had a larger influence on the musical life of this city than any other person\". Callaway then served as organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Washington. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Ascension%20and%20Saint%20Agnes\"&gt;Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, where his &lt;a href=\"requiem\"&gt;requiem&lt;/a&gt; was held following his death from cancer on March 21, 1995. A memorial tuba rank was installed on the organ of the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes in his memory."
