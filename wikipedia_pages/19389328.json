Prior to his coaching career, he had a nine-year playing career in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Football%20League\"&gt;Arena Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nStingley also played &lt;a href=\"college%20baseball\"&gt;college baseball&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Triton%20College\"&gt;Triton College&lt;/a&gt; and was selected in the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft\"&gt;1993 Major League Baseball Draft&lt;/a&gt; as a center fielder by the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent three seasons (1993\u20131995) in their minor-league system.\nEarly life.\nStingley was just seven years old when his father, &lt;a href=\"Darryl%20Stingley\"&gt;Darryl Stingley&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"paralyzed\"&gt;paralyzed&lt;/a&gt; in a preseason game, after being hit by &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Tatum\"&gt;Jack Tatum&lt;/a&gt; on August 12, 1978.\nCollege career.\nStingley enrolled at &lt;a href=\"Purdue%20University\"&gt;Purdue University&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, where he intended to play both &lt;a href=\"College%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;. However, he soon decided that he was too small, at just 5' 10\" tall and 150 &lt;a href=\"Pound%20%28mass%29\"&gt;pounds&lt;/a&gt;, to play football in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt;.
