    "text": "Musa K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir (also spelled Kiazim Karabekir in English; 23 July 1882 \u2013 26 January 1948) was a &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; general and politician. He was the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Eastern Army&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; at the end of World War I and served as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Speakers%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Grand National Assembly of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; before his death.\nEarly life.\nKarabekir was born in 1882 as the son of an Ottoman general, Mehmet Emin Pasha, in the Kocamustafapa\u015fa quarter of the Kuleli neighborhood of Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire. The Karabekir family traced its heritage back to the medieval &lt;a href=\"Karamanids\"&gt;Karamanid Principality&lt;/a&gt;, in central Anatolia.\nKarabekir toured several places in the Ottoman Empire while his father served in the army. He returned to Istanbul in 1893 with his mother after his father died in &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in the &lt;a href=\"Zeyrek%20Camii\"&gt;Zeyrek Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Karabekir was put into Fatih Military Secondary School the next year. After finishing his education there, he attended the &lt;a href=\"Kuleli%20Military%20High%20School\"&gt;Kuleli Military High School&lt;/a&gt; from which he graduated in 1899. He continued his education at the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Military%20College\"&gt;Ottoman Military College&lt;/a&gt;, which he finished on 6 December 1902 at the top of his class.\nMilitary career.\nAs a junior officer, he was commissioned in January 1906 after two months to the Third Army in the region around &lt;a href=\"Bitola\"&gt;Bitola&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manastir%20Vilayet\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. There, he was involved in fights with &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"komitadji\"&gt;komitadji&lt;/a&gt;s. For his successful service, he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"senior%20captain\"&gt;senior captain&lt;/a&gt; in 1907. In the following years, he served in Constantinople and again in the Second Army in Edirne.\nOn 15 April 1911, K\u00e2z\u0131m applied to change his family name from Zeyrek to Karabekir. Until then, he had been called K\u00e2z\u0131m Zeyrek, after the place in which he lived with his mother, a custom in the Ottoman Empire as family names were not used. From then on, he adopted the name Karabekir, the name of his ancestors.\nBalkan Wars.\nDuring his service in Edirne, Karabekir was promoted to the rank of major on 27 April 1912. He took part in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Balkan%20War\"&gt;First Balkan War&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; forces but was captured during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Adrianople%20%281912%E2%80%9313%29\"&gt;Battle of Edirne-Kale&lt;/a&gt; on 22 April 1913. He remained a &lt;a href=\"prisoner-of-war\"&gt;prisoner-of-war&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"armistice\"&gt;armistice&lt;/a&gt; of 21 October 1913.\nWorld War I.\nBefore the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Karabekir served in &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; and was then sent to some European countries like &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, France and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1914, he returned home, as a world war was likely.\nBack in Constantinople, Karabekir was assigned the chief of &lt;a href=\"intelligence%20%28information%20gathering%29\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; at the General Staff. Soon, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;. After a short time on the southeastern front, he was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Dardanelles\"&gt;Dardanelles&lt;/a&gt;. As commander of the 14th Division, Karabekir fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gallipoli\"&gt;Battle of Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1915. In October 1915, he was appointed chief staff officer at the First Army in Istanbul.\nHe was commissioned to the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Iraq\"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; front to join the Sixth Army. For his success at &lt;a href=\"Gallipoli\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;, he was decorated in December 1915 by both the Ottoman and the German Commands and was contemporaneously promoted to &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;. In April 1916, he took over the command of the 18th Corps, which gained a great victory over the British forces led by General &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Vere%20Ferrers%20Townshend\"&gt;Charles Townshend&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Kut\"&gt;Siege of Kut-al Amara&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq.\nKarabekir was appointed commander of the 2nd Corps on the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasia&lt;/a&gt;n front and fought bitterly against the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; forces for almost ten months. In September 1917, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"brigadier%20general\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt; by a decree of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;. In Mai 1918 he became the commander of the 15th Army Corps in &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzerum&lt;/a&gt; and as he began to grasp the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, he began to prepare for a war against the Armenians. \nTurkish War of Independence.\nIn compliance with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres\"&gt;Treaty of S\u00e8vres&lt;/a&gt;, which ended World War I, Ottoman Sultan &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20VI\"&gt;Mehmet Vahdettin&lt;/a&gt; gave Karabekir the order to surrender to &lt;a href=\"Entente%20powers\"&gt;Entente powers&lt;/a&gt;, which he refused to obey. Contrary to the orders of the British to demobilize the Ottoman army in Eastern Anatolia he provided the Turkish rural population with weapons. He stayed in the region and, on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Erzurum%20Congress\"&gt;Erzurum Congress&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk)&lt;/a&gt; had just arrived in &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt;, he secured the city with a cavalry brigade under his command to protect him and the congressmen. He pledged with Mustafa Kemal to join the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20national%20movement\"&gt;Turkish national movement&lt;/a&gt; and then took the command of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Turkish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Kuva-yi%20Milliye\"&gt;Kuva-yi Milliye&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early September 1920, Karabekir commenced the first military operations against the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Armenia&lt;/a&gt;. There were brief small-scale skirmishes in the region of &lt;a href=\"Olti\"&gt;Olti&lt;/a&gt;, but as the Turkish offensive elicited virtually no reaction from the Allied Powers, Karabekir opened up the offensive. On 28 September, he sent four divisions from the XV Army Corps across the Armenian border with the objective of capturing the strategic fortress of &lt;a href=\"Sar%C4%B1kam%C4%B1%C5%9F\"&gt;Sarikamish&lt;/a&gt;. Sarikamish was taken the following day, and the rest of the Turkish advance continued unchecked. Throughout October, Armenian resistance progressively collapsed, and the Turkish armies captured &lt;a href=\"Kars\"&gt;Kars&lt;/a&gt; on 30 October and occupied &lt;a href=\"Gyumri\"&gt;Alexandropol&lt;/a&gt;, a major centre of the new &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Republic\"&gt;Armenian Republic&lt;/a&gt;, on 6 November. A ceasefire was concluded on 18 November, and negotiations were carried out between Karabekir and a peace delegation, led by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Khatisian\"&gt;Alexander Khatisian&lt;/a&gt;, in Alexandropol. Although Karabekir's terms were extremely harsh, the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. Karabekir affixed his signature under the peace agreement, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Alexandropol\"&gt;Treaty of Alexandropol&lt;/a&gt;, which was signed on 2/3 December 1920.\nIn 1924, he was assigned to take &lt;a href=\"Hakkari%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt; back. He was designated by the new &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Grand National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; to sign also the friendship agreement &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Kars\"&gt;Treaty of Kars&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; on 23 October 1921.\nPolitical career.\nAfter the defeat of Greek forces in Western &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Republic of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed. K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir Pasha moved to &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; in October 1922 and continued to serve in the parliament as Deputy of Edirne. He was still the acting commander of the Eastern Army when he was elected Deputy of Constantinople on 29 June 1923. Six months later, he was appointed Inspector of the First Army. He received the highest Turkish award by the parliament, the \"Order of Independence\" for his meritorious and distinguished service in the military and politics during the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. He retired from military service in October 1924 and then entered politics.\nKarabekir had differences of opinion with &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal&lt;/a&gt; about the realization of &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk%27s%20reforms\"&gt;Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most important being the abolition of &lt;a href=\"caliphate\"&gt;caliphate&lt;/a&gt;. Even though he agreed with Mustafa Kemal on the subject, he did not agree with him on immediate action. For Karabekir, the timing was inappropriate because British forces stood at the border of southeastern &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and claimed &lt;a href=\"Kirkuk\"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt;, now in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Karabekir did not believe that the caliphate should be abolished before this was solved. &lt;a href=\"Kurds\"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;, more radical in their &lt;a href=\"Shafi\"&gt;Shafi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; beliefs, began to rise against the government because they thought that the government would abolish religion after it ended the caliphate. Struggling with the rebellion, Turkey agreed to leave Kirkuk to Iraq, which was under the British mandate. Such conflicts prompted tensions between Karabekir and Mustafa Kemal.\nOn 17 November 1924, several politicians around Karabekir and &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Fuat%20Cebesoy\"&gt;Ali Fuat Cebesoy&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Republican%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Progressive Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet F\u0131rkas\u0131\"), which had several prominent current and former military commanders as its members. Afterwards, the party's recent members were blamed for the &lt;a href=\"Sheikh%20Said%20rebellion\"&gt;Sheikh Said rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the assassination attempt made against Mustafa Kemal in &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0zmir\"&gt;\u0130zmir&lt;/a&gt;. The party was closed on 5 June 1925 by the government, and Karabekir was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Tribunal\"&gt;Independence Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;s with many of his party members but later acquitted and released. Following those developments, all relations were broken between Karabekir and Mustafa Kemal.\nRetiring temporarily from politics, Karabekir devoted himself to writing his memoirs of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Turkish War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; and Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms. After Kemal Atat\u00fcrk died in 1938, Karabekir's close friend &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0smet%20%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC\"&gt;\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc&lt;/a&gt; rehabilitated him.\nIn 1939, K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir returned to politics and re-entered parliament as an MP from Istanbul. He was elected speaker of the parliament on 5 August 1946. He died in office at the age of 66 on 26 January 1948 in Ankara after a heart attack. His remains were later relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20State%20Cemetery\"&gt;Turkish State Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Ankara.\nK\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir was survived by his wife \u0130clal and three daughters Hayat, Emel, and Timsal. The four-story mansion in the Erenk\u00f6y quarter of &lt;a href=\"Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y\"&gt;Kad\u0131k\u00f6y&lt;/a&gt; district in Istanbul, where he lived for almost 15 years, was converted into a museum in 2005.\nPersonal views.\n&lt;a href=\"Rauf%20Orbay\"&gt;Rauf Orbay&lt;/a&gt; stated that the proclamation of the &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; was rushed, and the most correct form of government would be the one in which the &lt;a href=\"caliph\"&gt;caliph&lt;/a&gt; would preside. While &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Fuat%20Cebesoy\"&gt;Ali Fuat Cebesoy&lt;/a&gt; was agreeing to this view, K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir told them that he was a supporter of the republic, and was against a personal &lt;a href=\"sultanate\"&gt;sultanate&lt;/a&gt;."
