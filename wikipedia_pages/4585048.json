    "text": "Ioan Viorel Ganea (born 10 August 1973) is a Romanian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28sport%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nGanea debuted in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Liga I&lt;/a&gt; (Divizia A at that time) with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bra%C8%99ov%20%281936%29\"&gt;FC Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. He went on to play for a number of clubs in Romanian football over the next five years. He joined &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; in January 1999, where he scored 11 goals in the remainder of the season to fire the club to the league championship. He finished &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;that season&lt;/a&gt; with 28 goals overall, making him the leading goalscorer.\nThis form won him a move to &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1999. He remained in Germany for four seasons and tasted &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; action, but was never a regular starter. He moved to &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCper%20Lig\"&gt;Turkish top flight&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Bursaspor\"&gt;Bursaspor&lt;/a&gt; in June 2003 on a free transfer, but stayed there for just six months before moving to England.\nThe striker joined &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; in December 2003 after his contract in Turkey was cancelled by mutual consent. He scored three Premier League goals during the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football%23FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2003\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 against eventual champions &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 but could not prevent relegation.\nHe remained with the club for two seasons in the second tier, mostly under the managerialship of &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Hoddle\"&gt;Glenn Hoddle&lt;/a&gt;. The first of these years was written off after suffering cruciate knee ligament injury on a pre-season tour of Norway. He recovered for the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; but never held down a regular starting place, and was released as his contract expired at the end of the campaign.\nHe moved back to Romania, with &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; on an initial one-year deal. However, just six months later, Ganea broke this contract to rejoin &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; on a record &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;350,000 (&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;462,000) a season. Although contracted to the end of 2009 with Rapid, Ganea left on a free transfer in June 2007 for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Timi%C5%9Foara\"&gt;FC Timi\u015foara&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that he could have earned up to \u20ac1\u00a0million a season through bonuses at Rapid.\nHe returned briefly on the pitch as a professional player only for one game on 22 September 2011 in a &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Cupa%20Rom%C3%A2niei%23Round%20of%2032\"&gt;Romanian Cup&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nGanea made his debut for the &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romanian national team&lt;/a&gt; on 3 March 1999 against &lt;a href=\"Estonia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 win. He represented his country at &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; and scored a last-minute penalty against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; that took Romania to the quarter finals at the expense of their opponent. He made 45 caps and 19 goals, but his last game was in 2006.\nControversy.\nAt the beginning of his career, while playing at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bra%C8%99ov%20%281936%29\"&gt;FC Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt;, Ganea beat up the team captain Dorel Purdea.\nDuring his stay at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;U Craiova&lt;/a&gt;, Ganea was involved in several controversies. Ganea kicked his teammate &lt;a href=\"Cornel%20Fr%C4%83sineanu\"&gt;Cornel Fr\u0103sineanu&lt;/a&gt; in the mouth, which left him without a few teeth and for a while he had to eat using a straw. &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Tric%C4%83\"&gt;Eugen Tric\u0103&lt;/a&gt; tried to calm him down but Ionel threatened to beat him too so Tric\u0103 backed off. He also had a fight with &lt;a href=\"Silvian%20Cristescu\"&gt;Silvian Cristescu&lt;/a&gt; who threw a massage table at his head. On 2 May 1998 &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; needed to win the match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;U Craiova&lt;/a&gt; in order to be sure that they win the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Liga I&lt;/a&gt; title so they agreed with George Ilinca who was &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;U Craiova&lt;/a&gt;'s owner to let them win the game. Some players, including Ionel Ganea did not agree to take part in the arrangement, the game ended 2\u20132 with both of U Craiova's goals being scored by Ganea, and the title was won by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; he had a fight with teammate &lt;a href=\"Jochen%20Seitz\"&gt;Jochen Seitz&lt;/a&gt;, for which he was punished by the club with a 10.000 &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Mark\"&gt;marks&lt;/a&gt; fine. One day Ganea was eating an ice cream and coach &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Magath\"&gt;Felix Magath&lt;/a&gt; saw him and told him that he shouldn't be eating food that contains too many calories because he has weight issues, Ganea got mad and threw the ice cream at him.\nIn a match at &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; Ionel was tackled hard by &lt;a href=\"Sol%20Campbell\"&gt;Sol Campbell&lt;/a&gt; but the referee did not take any measure against him, so Ionel waited for Campbell to get close to him and when none of the referees were watching he hit him and cussed him: \"Motherfucker! Bitch!\". \nIn 2001, he had a fight with the goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Stelea\"&gt;Stelea&lt;/a&gt; in a training session that took part before a &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; game. During the match with the Italians, the striker was one step away from hitting his coach &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%B6l%C3%B6ni\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni&lt;/a&gt;, because he was mad that the coach left him on the bench.\nWhile playing for &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in April 2004, he tackled &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"John%20Kennedy%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29\"&gt;John Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; resulting in a knee injury that left Kennedy unable to play for three years. Kennedy has since been forced to retire from professional football as a result of this and subsequent injuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Steven%20Gerrard\"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt;'s autobiography contains an episode about an incident between him and Ionel Ganea in a &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; game played in January 2004: \"He tore my leg from the knee to the ankle. Under the puttee, my leg was cut deep, a nasty wound\". After finding out what Gerrard wrote about him in his autobiography Ganea told the press:\"I inform Gerrard that when I write my autobiography, I will not mention him. I will not have room for little girls\".\nIn April 2006 he was involved in more controversy when he criticised the &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; manager at that time, &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Hoddle\"&gt;Glenn Hoddle&lt;/a&gt;, claiming \"he is the most difficult manager I have worked with in my career\". &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Hoddle\"&gt;Glenn Hoddle&lt;/a&gt; also fined him with a one-week salary for fighting at a training session with a teammate.\nWhile playing for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; in a match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;U Craiova&lt;/a&gt; he hit opponent's &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Baird%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Michael Baird&lt;/a&gt;'s mouth with his head during half-time.\nIn August 2007 after a &lt;a href=\"FC%20Unirea%20Urziceni\"&gt;Unirea Urziceni&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; game the striker had a conflict with the president of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Unirea%20Urziceni\"&gt;Unirea Urziceni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Stoica\"&gt;Mihai Stoica&lt;/a&gt;, with Ganea grabbing him by the neck until the &lt;a href=\"Gendarmery\"&gt;Gendarmery&lt;/a&gt; officers separated them.\nOne week later, Ganea was banned for 22 matches, which were later reduced to 16, after attacking one of the assistant referees after being sent off during a match between his club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Politehnica Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. In his first match played against &lt;a href=\"CFR%20Cluj\"&gt;CFR Cluj&lt;/a&gt; after executing the 16 match suspension, he had a verbal conflict with former &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Craiova\"&gt;U Craiova&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Tric%C4%83\"&gt;Eugen Tric\u0103&lt;/a&gt; before the beginning of the match, being close to start a fight after the end of the match.\nIn 2012 while attending at &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Dr%C4%83gan\"&gt;Ioan Dr\u0103gan&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral, who was his wedding's Godfather and a former &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bra%C8%99ov%20%281936%29\"&gt;FC Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt; teammate he almost got into a fight with the priest, being unsatisfied of the way he was preaching.\nWhile coaching &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Cluj\"&gt;Universitatea Cluj&lt;/a&gt; he was accused by player Cristian Mure\u0219an of beating him up but Ganea denied the incident.\nDuring his coaching period at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Voluntari\"&gt;FC Voluntari&lt;/a&gt; after a 1\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Ia%C8%99i%20%282010%29\"&gt;CSMS Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt; he had a conflict with a female journalist named Alina Iosub in which he offended and cussed her, she also threatened him by saying that if he comes to &lt;a href=\"Boto%C8%99ani\"&gt;Boto\u0219ani&lt;/a&gt;, he won't leave there alive.\nHis wife, Dana, with which he was married for over 24 years accused him of physical and verbal domestic violence and filled for divorce several times, also asking for a restraining order against him.\nPersonal life.\nHis son, &lt;a href=\"George%20Ganea\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; is also a footballer.\nInternational stats.\nInternational goals.\n\"Scores and results table. \"Score\" indicates the score after the player's goal:\"\nHonours.\nClub.\nUniversitatea Craiova\nRapid Bucure\u0219ti\nVfB Stuttgart\nCoach.\nDun\u0103rea C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i"
