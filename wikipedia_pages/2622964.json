    "title": "Scabbling",
    "text": "Scabbling\u2014also called scappling\u2014is the process of reducing stone or concrete. In masonry, it refers to shaping a stone to a rough square by use of an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;. In Kent, &lt;a href=\"rag-stone\"&gt;rag-stone&lt;/a&gt; masons call this \"knobbling\". It was similarly used to shape &lt;a href=\"grindstones\"&gt;grindstones&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn modern construction, scabbling is a mechanical process of removing a thin layer of concrete from a structure, typically achieved by &lt;a href=\"compressed%20air\"&gt;compressed air&lt;/a&gt; powered machines. A typical scabbling machine uses several heads, each with several &lt;a href=\"carbide\"&gt;carbide&lt;/a&gt; or steel tips that peck at the concrete. It operates by pounding a number of tipped rods down onto the concrete surface in rapid succession. It takes several passes with the machine to achieve the desired depth. \nScabbling is used to remove road markings, surface &lt;a href=\"contamination\"&gt;contamination&lt;/a&gt; (used in the &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear&lt;/a&gt; industry), to add a decorative or textured pattern to concrete, or to prepare a concrete surface prior to the installation of &lt;a href=\"grout\"&gt;grout&lt;/a&gt;."
