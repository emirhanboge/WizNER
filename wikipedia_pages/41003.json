    "text": "dBm or dBmW (decibel-milliwatts) is a unit of &lt;a href=\"level%20%28logarithmic%20quantity%29\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; used to indicate that a power level is expressed in &lt;a href=\"decibel\"&gt;decibel&lt;/a&gt;s (dB) with reference to one &lt;a href=\"milliwatt\"&gt;milliwatt&lt;/a&gt; (mW). It is used in radio, microwave and fiber-optical communication networks as a convenient measure of absolute &lt;a href=\"power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; because of its capability to express both very large and very small values in a short form. &lt;a href=\"dBW\"&gt;dBW&lt;/a&gt; is a similar unit, referenced to one watt (1000\u00a0mW).\nThe decibel (dB) is a &lt;a href=\"dimensionless%20unit\"&gt;dimensionless unit&lt;/a&gt;, used for quantifying the ratio between two values, such as &lt;a href=\"signal-to-noise%20ratio\"&gt;signal-to-noise ratio&lt;/a&gt;. The dBm is also dimensionless, but since it compares to a fixed reference value, the dBm rating is an absolute one.\nThe dBm is not a part of the &lt;a href=\"International%20System%20of%20Units\"&gt;International System of Units&lt;/a&gt; and therefore is discouraged from use in documents or systems that adhere to SI units (the corresponding SI unit is the watt). However, the unit &lt;a href=\"decibel\"&gt;decibel&lt;/a&gt; (dB), without the 'm' suffix, is permitted for relative quantities, but not accepted for use directly alongside SI units. 10 dBm may be written 10 dB (1 mW) in SI.\nIn audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to a 600-ohm &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20impedance\"&gt;impedance&lt;/a&gt;, while in radio-frequency work dBm is typically referenced relative to a 50-ohm impedance.\nUnit conversions.\nA power level of 0\u00a0dBm corresponds to a power of 1 milliwatt. A 10\u00a0dB increase in level is equivalent to a 10-fold increase in power. Therefore, a 20\u00a0dB increase in level is equivalent to a 100-fold increase in power. A 3\u00a0dB increase in level is approximately equivalent to doubling the power, which means that a level of 3\u00a0dBm corresponds roughly to a power of 2\u00a0mW. Similarly, for each 3\u00a0dB decrease in level, the power is reduced by about one half, making \u22123\u00a0dBm correspond to a power of about 0.5\u00a0mW.\nTo express an arbitrary power \"P\" in mW as \"x\" in dBm, the following expression may be used:\nConversely, to express an arbitrary power level \"x\" in dBm, as \"P\" in mW:\nBelow is a table summarizing useful cases:\nThe signal intensity (power per unit area) can be converted to received signal power by multiplying by the square of the wavelength and dividing by 4\u03c0 (see &lt;a href=\"Free-space%20path%20loss\"&gt;Free-space path loss&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;United States Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; practice, &lt;a href=\"Weighting%20filter\"&gt;unweighted&lt;/a&gt; measurement is normally understood, applicable to a certain &lt;a href=\"Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29\"&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt;, which must be stated or implied.\nIn European practice, &lt;a href=\"psophometric%20weighting\"&gt;psophometric weighting&lt;/a&gt; may be, as indicated by context, equivalent to &lt;a href=\"dBm0p\"&gt;dBm0p&lt;/a&gt;, which is preferred.\nIn audio, 0 dBm often corresponds to approximately 0.775 volts, since 0.775\u00a0V dissipates 1\u00a0mW in a 600\u00a0\u03a9 load. The corresponding voltage level is 0 &lt;a href=\"Decibel%23Voltage\"&gt;dBu&lt;/a&gt;, without the 600 \u03a9 restriction. Conversely, for RF situations with a 50\u00a0\u03a9 load, 0\u00a0dBm corresponds to approximately 0.224 volts, since 0.224\u00a0V dissipates 1\u00a0mW in a 50\u00a0\u03a9 load.\nIn general the relationship between the power level \"P\" in dBms and the RMS voltage \"V\" in volts across a load of resistance \"R\" (typically used to terminate a transmission line with impedance \"Z\") is:\nExpression in dBm is typically used for optical and electrical power measurements, not for other types of power (such as thermal). A &lt;a href=\"Orders%20of%20magnitude%20%28power%29\"&gt;listing by power levels in watts&lt;/a&gt; is available that includes a variety of examples not necessarily related to electrical or optical power.\nThe dBm was first proposed as an industry standard in the paper \"A New Standard Volume Indicator and Reference Level\"."
