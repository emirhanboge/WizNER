In two years, he allows the club now called the Olympic Club of Medenine to access in &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20Ligue%20Professionnelle%201\"&gt;Ligue I&lt;/a&gt;. His successor in 2000, Mongi Ksiksi, provided some continuity for the club but the financial means were no longer up to the ambitions and the club found itself again in Ligue III. However, the club regained its ambitions and, in two years, got two accessions that bring him temporarily in Ligue I in 2017, after a play-off against the &lt;a href=\"AS%20La%20Marsa\"&gt;AS La Marsa&lt;/a&gt;."
