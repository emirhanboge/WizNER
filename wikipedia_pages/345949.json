    "text": "The King's African Rifles (KAR) was a multi-&lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"British%20colony\"&gt;British colonial&lt;/a&gt; regiment raised from Britain's various possessions in East Africa from 1902 until independence in the 1960s. It performed both military and internal security functions within the colonial territories, and served outside these territories during the World Wars. The rank and file (&lt;a href=\"askaris\"&gt;askaris&lt;/a&gt;) were drawn from native inhabitants, while most of the officers were seconded from the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;. When the KAR was first raised there were some Sudanese officers in the battalions raised in &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, and native officers were commissioned towards the end of British colonial rule.\nUniforms.\nUntil independence, the parade uniform of the KAR comprised &lt;a href=\"khaki\"&gt;khaki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drill%20%28fabric%29\"&gt;drill&lt;/a&gt;, with tall &lt;a href=\"Fez%20%28hat%29\"&gt;fezzes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cummerbund\"&gt;cummerbund&lt;/a&gt;s. Both of the latter items were normally red, although there were some battalion distinctions with Nyasaland units, for example, wearing black fezzes.\nPrior to 1914, the regiment's field service uniforms consisted of a dark blue &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"puttee\"&gt;puttee&lt;/a&gt;s, khaki shorts and a khaki fez cover with integral foldable cloth peak and neck flap. Askaris wore sandals or were barefoot, on the rationale that the heavy military boots of the period were unsuitable for African recruits who had not previously worn footwear. Fezzes bore an Arabic or Roman number with the wartime-raised battalions wearing theirs on geometric-shaped patches of cloth. During the Great War, all the dark blue items were replaced with khaki equivalents, and a short &lt;a href=\"pillbox%20hat\"&gt;pillbox hat&lt;/a&gt; with a khaki cover was worn on campaign. After the war, the khaki shirt was replaced by a collarless blue-grey &lt;a href=\"Angora%20wool\"&gt;angora&lt;/a&gt; shirt called a \"greyback\". Officers and senior NCOs wore &lt;a href=\"slouch%20hats\"&gt;slouch hats&lt;/a&gt; with coloured &lt;a href=\"hackle\"&gt;hackle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFormation.\nSix &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s were formed in 1902 by the amalgamation of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Africa%20Regiment\"&gt;Central Africa Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (CAR), &lt;a href=\"East%20Africa%20Rifles\"&gt;East Africa Rifles&lt;/a&gt; (EAR) and &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20Rifles\"&gt;Uganda Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, with one or two battalions located in each of &lt;a href=\"Nyasaland\"&gt;Nyasaland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20Somaliland\"&gt;British Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalions were also known as the 1st and 2nd &lt;a href=\"British%20Central%20Africa\"&gt;Central African&lt;/a&gt; Battalions.\nOn formation, there was no regular staff system in connection with these six battalions beyond the usual regimental staff and an Inspector-General who made two annual tours and reported to the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Office\"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 5th and 6th battalions were disbanded by 1910 as a cost-saving measure by the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Office\"&gt;Colonial Office&lt;/a&gt; and out of white-settler concern over the existence of a large indigenous armed force.\nOperational history.\nSomaliland campaigns.\nDuring the early 1900s the King's African Rifles took part in the &lt;a href=\"Somaliland%20campaign\"&gt;Somaliland campaign&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20Abdullah%20Hassan\"&gt;Mohammed Abdullah Hassan&lt;/a&gt; (known to the British as the 'Mad Mullah') and the &lt;a href=\"Dervish%20movement%20%28Somali%29\"&gt;Dervishes&lt;/a&gt;. Lt-Col. &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Cobbe\"&gt;Alexander Cobbe&lt;/a&gt; of 1st (Central Africa) Battalion KAR, was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; for his action at Erego, on 6 October 1902.\nThe KAR were part of the British air and ground force that defeated the &lt;a href=\"Dervish%20movement%20%28Somali%29\"&gt;Dervish movement&lt;/a&gt; in 1920.\nFirst World War.\nThe KAR began the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; with 21 small companies in three battalions (each with up to eight companies following the British pre-1913 half-company &lt;a href=\"Table%20of%20Organization%20and%20Equipment\"&gt;establishment&lt;/a&gt;): the 1st Nyasaland (half of the battalion was located in the northeast &lt;a href=\"Nyasaland\"&gt;Nyasaland&lt;/a&gt;), 3rd East Africa (with one company on &lt;a href=\"Zanzibar\"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt;) and the 4th Uganda, both of the latter included the 4th platoon of Sudanese with the 4th platoon of 4th battalion being led by Sudanese officers. Additionally, the companies were scattered over British East Africa.\nFull strength of the KAR in 1914 was 70 British officers, three British NCOs, and 2,325 Africans. There were no organic heavy weapons (each company had one machine gun), including artillery or organised reserves and the companies were, in reality, large platoons of 70 to 80 men.\nIn 1915 the KAR was expanded by having the three battalions reorganised into standard four-company battalions, which were then brought up to full strength at 1,045 men each. It was not until early 1916 that the 2nd Nyasaland and 5th Kenya battalions [1916\u20131963] were re-raised, this being due to do with white sensitivities in Kenya about arming and training large numbers of black African troops. Later in 1916 the 2nd, 3rd and 4th battalions were expanded into two battalions each through recruiting in their home areas. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Hoskins\"&gt;General Hoskins&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the &lt;a href=\"Inspector%20General\"&gt;Inspector General&lt;/a&gt; of the KAR) was appointed to command British East African forces in 1917 that genuine expansion began. The 1st Battalion was doubled and the 6th (Tanganyika Territory) Battalion was raised from \"&lt;a href=\"Schutztruppe\"&gt;Schutztruppe&lt;/a&gt;\" of the former &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;German East Africa&lt;/a&gt; and then it too was doubled. The 7th was formed from the Zanzibar Armed Constabulary and the &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Island\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; Constabulary. Later in 1917 many other duplicate battalions were created as the first four battalions (now called regiments in the British tradition) each raised a 3rd battalion and a 4th or Training Battalion. The 4th Regiment raised an additional two battalions, the 5th, and 6th through recruiting in Uganda. The KAR Mounted Infantry Unit (on camels), originally part of the 3rd regiment and the KAR Signals Company were also raised.\nThus in late 1918, the KAR consisted of 22 battalions as follows:\nPart of the KAR's expansion involved bringing up unit strengths to the same size as British and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Army\"&gt;Indian Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Service%20Troops\"&gt;Imperial Service units&lt;/a&gt;, while also increasing the numbers of white officers and NCOs. The increase in cadres was difficult due to the shortage of &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt;-speaking whites, as many white settlers had already formed segregated units such as the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Mounted%20Rifles\"&gt;East African Mounted Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Regiment\"&gt;East African Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20Volunteer%20Rifles\"&gt;Uganda Volunteer Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zanzibar%20Volunteer%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Zanzibar Volunteer Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe regiment fought in the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;East African Campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the German commander &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erich%20von%20Lettow-Vorbeck\"&gt;Paul Erich von Lettow-Vorbeck&lt;/a&gt; and his forces in German East Africa. Transport and support into the interior were provided by over 400,000 porters of the &lt;a href=\"Carrier%20Corps\"&gt;Carrier Corps&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the end of the Great War, the KAR comprised 1,193 British officers, 1,497 British NCOs and 30,658 Africans (33,348 total) in 22 battalions, including two made up of former German askaris, as noted above. In \"Armies in East Africa 1914\u201318\", Peter Abbot notes that the KAR units recruited from former prisoners of war were used as garrison troops by the British, to avoid any &lt;a href=\"conflict%20of%20interest\"&gt;conflict of loyalties&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of these battalions was involved in the pursuit of a force under Hauptman Wintgens from February to October 1917.\nKAR casualties in the First World War were 5,117 killed and wounded with another 3,039 dying from diseases.\nInter-war period.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt;, the KAR was slowly demobilised to a peacetime establishment of six battalions, at which strength the regiment remained until the Second World War. In 1938, the regiment was composed of two brigade-strength units organised as a \"Northern Brigade\" and a \"Southern Brigade.\" The combined strength of both units amounted to 94 officers, 60 non-commissioned officers, and 2,821 African other ranks. After the outbreak of war, these units provided the trained nucleus for the rapid expansion of the KAR. By March 1940, the strength of the KAR had reached 883 officers, 1,374 non-commissioned officers, and 20,026 African other ranks.\nSecond World War.\nThe KAR fought in several campaigns during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. It fought against the Italians in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20East%20Africa\"&gt;Italian East Africa&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;East African Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, against the &lt;a href=\"Vichy%20France\"&gt;Vichy French&lt;/a&gt; in Madagascar during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Madagascar\"&gt;Battle of Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, and against the Japanese in &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Burma%20Campaign\"&gt;Burma Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The Somaliland battalions were heavily involved in defending the colony against the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20conquest%20of%20British%20Somaliland\"&gt;Italian invasion&lt;/a&gt; of August 1940, but were forced to retreat and evacuate after defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tug%20Argan\"&gt;Battle of Tug Argan&lt;/a&gt; from 11\u201315 August.\nInitially, the KAR was deployed as the 1st East African Infantry Brigade and the 2nd East African Infantry Brigade. The first brigade was responsible for coastal defence and the second for the defence of the interior. (See &lt;a href=\"1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;1st SA Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;). By the end of July 1940, two additional East African brigades were formed, the 3rd East African Infantry Brigade and the 6th East African Infantry Brigade. Initially a Coastal Division and a Northern Frontier District Division were planned, but, instead, the &lt;a href=\"1st%20%28African%29%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;11th African Division&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20%28African%29%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;12th African Division&lt;/a&gt; was formed.\nThe two divisions included East African, &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;ian, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n, and South African troops. The Ghanaian and Nigerian troops came from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20West%20African%20Frontier%20Force\"&gt;Royal West African Frontier Force&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of a war contingency plan, a brigade each was provided from the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; (now Ghana) and from Nigeria for service in Kenya. A Nigerian brigade, together with two East African brigades (the KAR brigades) and some South Africans, formed the 11th African Division. The 12th African Division was similarly formed, but with the Ghanaian brigade instead of the Nigerian brigade.\nIn 1941, during the East African Campaign, Sergeant &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Gray%20Leakey\"&gt;Nigel Gray Leakey&lt;/a&gt; of the 1/6th Battalion was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; (VC).\nThe 11th African Division was disbanded in November 1941 and the 12th African Division was disbanded in April 1943. In 1943, the &lt;a href=\"11th%20%28East%20Africa%29%20Division\"&gt;11th (East Africa) Division&lt;/a&gt; was formed and it fought in &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, two independent infantry brigades were sent from East Africa to India for service in Burma. The 22 (East Africa) Infantry Brigade served in the Arakan under command of XV Indian Corps, while the 28th (East Africa) Infantry Brigade served under IV Corps, playing a crucial role in the crossing of the Irrawaddy River.\nBy the end of the war, the regiment had raised forty-three battalions (including two in British Somaliland), nine independent garrison companies, an armoured car regiment, an artillery unit, as well as engineer, signal and transport sections.\nAfter the Second World War.\nThe regiment played a major role in operations during the &lt;a href=\"Mau%20Mau%20Uprising\"&gt;Mau Mau Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya. In 1952, the 7th (Kenya) Battalion was reformed; it was renumbered as the 11th (Kenya) Battalion in 1956. 2nd/3rd Battalion, a reserve unit, was raised during the military phase of the emergency in Kenya and was under consideration for disbandment by 1957. A company of the regiment was accused of war crimes in connection with the &lt;a href=\"Chuka%20massacre\"&gt;Chuka massacre&lt;/a&gt; in 1952.\nThe 1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions saw service in the &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20Emergency\"&gt;Malayan Emergency&lt;/a&gt;, where they were heavily involved in fighting Communist rebels, suffering 23 dead.\nThe regiment was retitled the East African Land Forces in 1957. The last &lt;a href=\"Colonel-in-Chief\"&gt;Colonel-in-Chief&lt;/a&gt; of the KAR was &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;HM Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the various territories from which the KAR was recruited became independent, the regiment began to break up:\nThe extent to which KAR traditions influence the modern national armies of the former East African colonies varies from country to country. In Tanzania, &lt;a href=\"Tanganyika%20Rifles\"&gt;a mutiny in 1964&lt;/a&gt; led to a conscious decision to move away from the British military model. In Kenya, on the other hand, the title of Kenya Rifles survives and the various campaigns in which the KAR distinguished itself in both World Wars are still commemorated.\nOn the island of &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt; which is located off the eastern coast of Africa, a detachment of the King's African Rifles was present until 1960. It was gradually replaced by the newly formed Special Mobile Force (SMF) and Police Riot Unit (PRU).\nOnly the &lt;a href=\"Kenya%20Rifles\"&gt;Kenya Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Malawi%20Rifles\"&gt;Malawi Rifles&lt;/a&gt; still exist.\nBattle honours.\nThe regiment's battalions were not awarded &lt;a href=\"colour%20%28flag%29\"&gt;colours&lt;/a&gt; until 1924, as colours were not traditionally carried by rifle regiments. The colours had many of the regiment's &lt;a href=\"battle%20honour\"&gt;battle honour&lt;/a&gt;s emblazoned on it. The old colours were replaced in the 1950s."
