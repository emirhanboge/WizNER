    "text": "The municipalities of Iceland ( ) are local administrative areas in &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as &lt;a href=\"kindergarten\"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elementary%20school\"&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"waste%20management\"&gt;waste management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20services\"&gt;social services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20housing\"&gt;public housing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20transportation\"&gt;public transportation&lt;/a&gt;, services to &lt;a href=\"senior%20citizen\"&gt;senior citizen&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"disability\"&gt;handicap&lt;/a&gt;ped people. They also govern &lt;a href=\"zoning\"&gt;zoning&lt;/a&gt; and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Iceland\"&gt;Icelandic constitution&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the municipalities can be traced back to the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Iceland\"&gt;commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; period in the 10th century when rural communities were organized into &lt;a href=\"Hreppur\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; (\"hreppar\" ) with the main purpose of providing help for the poorest individuals in society. When &lt;a href=\"urbanization\"&gt;urbanization&lt;/a&gt; began in Iceland during the 18th and 19th centuries, several independent &lt;a href=\"township\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt;s (\"kaupsta\u00f0ir\" ) were created. The role of municipalities was further formalized during the 20th century and by the end of the century there was no longer any official distinction between urban and rural municipalities. \nThe trend in recent years has been to transfer more functions and power from the state to the municipalities. This has called for larger municipalities. The government encourages municipalities to merge but has taken a different approach to the issue than governments in other &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20countries\"&gt;Nordic countries&lt;/a&gt; where forced amalgamation is regularly carried out (such as the &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Denmark%23Municipal%20Reform%202007\"&gt;municipal reform&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; that took effect in 2007). Instead, the process is voluntary. Municipalities negotiate possible mergers among themselves, and any merger must first receive approval from the relevant municipality's constituent voting electorate in a referendum. A similar approach is used by the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroese&lt;/a&gt; government. However, municipalities having a population of below 50 may be forced to merge.\nThe number of municipalities peaked in the mid-20th century. There were 229 of them in 1950. By 1995, their number had been reduced to 170. In the year 2000, only 124 municipalities remained in Iceland, and since 2020 there are 69.\nGovernment.\nThe municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. Municipal elections were last held on 26 May 2018. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;s (\"b\u00e6jarstj\u00f3ri\" or \"borgarstj\u00f3ri\" ) in the mostly urban municipalities but \"municipal manager\" (\"sveitarstj\u00f3ri\" ) in the rural or mixed municipalities. It is common for these executive managers to be professionally hired and &lt;a href=\"Independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;politically independent&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOver the years, the number of municipalities in Iceland changed from 229 in 1953 to 69 in 2020:"
