    "text": "Baldrine is a village in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt;. It is close to the east coast of the island, about 3\u00a0km south of &lt;a href=\"Laxey\"&gt;Laxey&lt;/a&gt; and 6\u00a0km NE of &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the historic parish of &lt;a href=\"Lonan%20%28parish%29\"&gt;Lonan&lt;/a&gt;, in the sheading of &lt;a href=\"Garff\"&gt;Garff&lt;/a&gt;. For administrative purposes it is in the parish district of Garff, and it is also in the House of Keys constituency of Garff.\nGeography.\nBaldrine is located on the &lt;a href=\"A2%20road%20%28Isle%20of%20Man%29\"&gt;A2 road&lt;/a&gt;, the coast road between &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; and the area includes three halts (or stations) on the &lt;a href=\"Manx%20Electric%20Railway\"&gt;Manx Electric Railway&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Baldrine%20railway%20station\"&gt;Baldrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunnycott%20Halt\"&gt;Sunnycott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garwick%20Glen%20Halt\"&gt;Garwick Glen&lt;/a&gt;. The River Gawne flows through the village and then through Garwick Glen down towards Garwick Beach at Garwick Bay (part of &lt;a href=\"Laxey%20Bay\"&gt;Laxey Bay&lt;/a&gt;).\nAlso within the bounds of Baldrine is Ballannette Country Park, a nature reserve which includes a group of lakes and bird watching locations. The country park is a registered &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sky%20Park\"&gt;Dark Sky Park&lt;/a&gt;, where light pollution is restricted.\nHistory.\nThe name of the village dates back to at least 1643 and comes from the Manx words \"Bailey drine\", which translates to \"farm of the &lt;a href=\"Prunus%20spinosa\"&gt;blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt has had two &lt;a href=\"Primitive%20Methodist\"&gt;Primitive Methodist&lt;/a&gt; chapels, the first was built in 1843, under the direction of Anne Kelly, a resident of &lt;a href=\"Barroose\"&gt;Barroose&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband, Thomas Kelly, sold of land for the chapel for 2 shillings. Anne Kelly laid the first stone, and prayed upon it for the head of the church to bless the building. The building would cost \u00a3100 to erect.\nThe second chapel was built in 1883 when the first started to exceed its capacity, at the cost of \u00a3383. The new chapel could seat 118, and included a &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20school\"&gt;Sunday school&lt;/a&gt; for the local children.\nIn 1850, the Liverpool Arms &lt;a href=\"public%20house\"&gt;public house&lt;/a&gt; was opened in the village. The pub was shut in 2017, and the brewery that owned it put it up for sale, on the understanding that it would not longer be a pub. However, the local council did not allow the change of use, stating that the building should remain a pub.\nIn 2018 &lt;a href=\"Laxey%20Bay\"&gt;Laxey Bay&lt;/a&gt; was designated as a &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Marine Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt;."
