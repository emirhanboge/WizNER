Completed and commissioned in May 1945, she served during the final months of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. She surrendered at the end of the war in September 1945 and was &lt;a href=\"Scuttling\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; in April 1946.\nDesign and description.\nAt the end of 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided it needed large numbers of high-speed coastal submarines to defend the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Archipelago\"&gt;Japanese Home Islands&lt;/a&gt; against an anticipated &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; invasion (named &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Downfall\"&gt;Operation Downfall&lt;/a&gt; by the Allies). To meet this requirement, the \"Ha-201\"-class submarines were designed as small, fast submarines incorporating many of the same advanced ideas implemented in the German &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXI%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXIII%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXIII&lt;/a&gt; submarines. They were capable of submerged speeds of almost .\nThe \"Ha-201\" class &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by a single &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; that drove one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;. When submerged the propeller was driven by a &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;. They could reach on the surface and submerged. On the surface, the \"Ha-201\"-class submarines had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . Their armament consisted of two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s with four &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and a single mount for a 7.7-millimeter &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction and commissioning.\n\"Ha-203\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel-laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 5 April 1945 by the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Naval%20Arsenal\"&gt;Sasebo Naval Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sasebo\"&gt;Sasebo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, as Submarine No. 4913. She was renamed Ha-203 on 1 May 1945 and was attached provisionally to the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Naval%20District\"&gt;Sasebo Naval District&lt;/a&gt; that day. &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;Launched&lt;/a&gt; on 25 May 1945, she was completed and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 20\u00a0June\u00a01945.\nService history.\nUpon commissioning, \"Ha-203\" was attached formally to the Sasebo Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 33 in the &lt;a href=\"Kure%2C%20Hiroshima\"&gt;Kure&lt;/a&gt; Submarine Flotilla for workups. She had not yet conducted an operational patrol when hostilities between Japan and the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt; ended on 15 August 1945. She surrendered to the Allies at Sasebo on 2 September 1945. On 2 November 1945, she was reassigned to Japanese Submarine Division Three under &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; command along with her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s , , , and .\nDisposal.\nThe Japanese struck \"Ha-203\" from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. She was among a number of Japanese submarines the U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"Scuttling\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Goto%20Islands\"&gt;Goto Islands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Road%27s%20End\"&gt;Operation Road's End&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 1946, sinking just beyond the line at ."
