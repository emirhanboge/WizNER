    "text": "Rudolf Burger (8 December 1938 \u2013 19 April 2021) was an Austrian &lt;a href=\"philosopher\"&gt;philosopher&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nBurger was born in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in the year of the occupation and the annexation of Austria into &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Anschluss\"&gt;Anschluss&lt;/a&gt;. His parents were active &lt;a href=\"communists\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;. He concluded his studies of &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Technische%20Universit%C3%A4t%20Wien\"&gt;Technical University&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna and thereafter served as an assistant at the \"Institute of Applied Physics\", where he concluded his &lt;a href=\"doctorate\"&gt;doctorate&lt;/a&gt; in 1965.\nAfter working at the &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Boltzmann%20Gesellschaft\"&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Condensed Matter Physics&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna, Burger switched to the &lt;a href=\"Battelle%20Memorial%20Institute\"&gt;Battelle Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;. There he was part of the team for research plannings. He also joined the Planning Commission of Germany's &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Ministry%20of%20Education%20and%20Research%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Federal Ministry of Education and Research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bonn\"&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1973 to 1990 Burger headed the department for &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"humanities\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the Austrian \"Ministry of Science\". In 1979 Burger achieved his &lt;a href=\"habilitation\"&gt;habilitation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"sociology%20of%20scientific%20knowledge\"&gt;sociology of scientific knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, in 1987 he became a professor at the &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A4t%20f%C3%BCr%20angewandte%20Kunst%20Wien\"&gt;University of Applied Arts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where he was appointed to the chair for &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. From 1995 to 1999 Burger served as rector of this university. In 2007 he retired.\nSince the 1980s Burger initiated or participated in several intellectual and political discussions in Austria. His essays are published in the daily newspaper &lt;a href=\"Die%20Presse\"&gt;Die Presse&lt;/a&gt;, in the weekly &lt;a href=\"Profil%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;profil&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in intellectual magazines like &lt;a href=\"FORVM\"&gt;FORVM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leviathan%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Merkur%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Merkur&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurger died on 18 April 2021, aged 82.\nStatus.\nBurger is well appreciated for his elegant style as an essayist and his avid love for &lt;a href=\"intellectual\"&gt;intellectual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"criticism\"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;. His cynicism stirred some controversies, starting in 1990, when he opened the &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCnther%20Anders\"&gt;G\u00fcnther Anders&lt;/a&gt; symposium of the city of Vienna by speaking of \"moralistic extortion\", comparing Anders and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Heidegger\"&gt;Heidegger&lt;/a&gt;, equating their philosophies, and finally stating:\nPhilosopher &lt;a href=\"Konrad%20Paul%20Liessmann\"&gt;Konrad Paul Liessmann&lt;/a&gt; defended \"Anders\" and responded: \"[...] therefore the circumstances are dancing; but where is the rose?\". In 1992 Burger both criticised Austria's foreign policy at the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; as \"warmonger\" (in German: kriegsgeil) and at the same time requested to let the parties of the war &lt;a href=\"exsanguinate\"&gt;exsanguinate&lt;/a&gt;. These comments caused a nationwide controversy. In 2000 Burger criticised the \"Thursday Demonstrations\" against the &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Sch%C3%BCssel\"&gt;Sch\u00fcssel&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6rg%20Haider\"&gt;Haider&lt;/a&gt; coalition as an \"antifascist carnival\" and again unchained a national debate. Finally, in 2001 he angered a lot of critical intellectuals with his request to forget and close the debates on guilt and remembrance. Historian Heribert Schiedel therefore named him \"the black and blue court philosopher,\" black referring to &lt;a href=\"%C3%96VP\"&gt;\u00d6VP&lt;/a&gt;, blue to &lt;a href=\"FP%C3%96\"&gt;FP\u00d6&lt;/a&gt;."
