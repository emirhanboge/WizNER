    "text": "Two-Mile Borris (also written Twomileborris or Two Mile Borris; also called Borrisleigh and locally Borris or TMB) is a village in &lt;a href=\"County%20Tipperary\"&gt;County Tipperary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The village is located on the L4202 road at the junction with the Ballyduff Road, close to the &lt;a href=\"N75%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N75&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Thurles\"&gt;Thurles&lt;/a&gt; town centre. It is also situated 1 mile from junction 5 of the &lt;a href=\"M8%20motorway%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;M8 motorway&lt;/a&gt;. Its population was 572 as of the 2016 census, up from 502 in 2006. It is situated in the &lt;a href=\"townland\"&gt;townland&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Borris%2C%20Twomileborris\"&gt;Borris&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Twomileborris%20%28civil%20parish%29\"&gt;Twomileborris&lt;/a&gt; in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Barony%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;barony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eliogarty\"&gt;Eliogarty&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the 1830s, the village was the property of &lt;a href=\"Nugent_baronets%23Nugent_baronets.2C_of_Ballinlough_.281795.29\"&gt;Hugh Nugent O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory of the placename.\nThe name \"Borris\" is generally believed to have come from the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20language\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; word for a borough, district or stronghold. The Irish name \"Buir\u00edos L\u00e9ith\" was historically anglicised as \"Borrisleigh\" or \"Borris Leigh\". The use of \"Leigh\" in the placename would seem to be related to the monastic settlement of &lt;a href=\"Liathmore-Mochoem%C3%B3g\"&gt;Liathmore-Mochoem\u00f3g&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Leigh%2C%20County%20Tipperary\"&gt;Leigh&lt;/a&gt;, about a mile and a half to the north-east of the village. Those who prefer the Irish name of \"Buirgheas Dh\u00e1 Mh\u00edle\" say that the name refers to King Mile, ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Niall%20of%20the%20Nine%20Hostages\"&gt;Niall of the Nine Hostages&lt;/a&gt; and numerous Irish Kings and heroes.\nAmenities and facilities.\nIt has a primary school, Catholic church, two pubs and two shops. There are a number of &lt;a href=\"housing%20estate\"&gt;housing estate&lt;/a&gt;s. The village is located right at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Vale\"&gt;Golden Vale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bog%20of%20Allen\"&gt;Bog of Allen&lt;/a&gt; and so the quality of the land varies around the area, with most of the best farming land located to the west of the village. Parts of the land to the east are too boggy to be used, even for extracting turf. The village proper is bounded on the west by the Black River, a tributary of &lt;a href=\"River%20Drish\"&gt;River Drish&lt;/a&gt;, which goes on to join &lt;a href=\"River%20Suir\"&gt;River Suir&lt;/a&gt;. The approach to the village is dominated by a Norman tower-house.\nIn June 2011 &lt;a href=\"planning%20permission\"&gt;planning permission&lt;/a&gt; was given by &lt;a href=\"An%20Bord%20Plean%C3%A1la\"&gt;An Bord Plean\u00e1la&lt;/a&gt; for a casino, hotel with 500 rooms and a racetrack, known as the &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20Venue\"&gt;Tipperary Venue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"An%20Taisce\"&gt;An Taisce&lt;/a&gt; opposed the project, telling a planning tribunal that it had concerns about the impact on local water and other ecological factors as well as the commercial impact on &lt;a href=\"Limerick%20Racecourse\"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20Racecourse\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2011 then &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Justice%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Minister for Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Shatter\"&gt;Alan Shatter&lt;/a&gt; said that the casino project had been \"ruled out\" based on a &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; decision."
