    "text": "Sir Thomas Browne (140220 July 1460) was a &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer\"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;. Browne's tenure as Chancellor occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bullion%20Famine\"&gt;Great Bullion Famine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Slump%20%2815th%20century%29\"&gt;Great Slump&lt;/a&gt; in England. He was executed for treason on 20 July 1460.\nCareer.\nThomas Browne was the son and heir of Robert Browne and a nephew of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Browne\"&gt;Stephen Browne&lt;/a&gt; MP. In 1434 he was sworn to the peace in &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, and made a &lt;a href=\"Justice%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Justice of Peace&lt;/a&gt; there from 1436 to 24 December 1450. He was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Kent\"&gt;High Sheriff of Kent&lt;/a&gt; in 1439.\nHe was &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Dover%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt; in the 1439-40 Parliament, for &lt;a href=\"Kent%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; in 1445\u20136, and for &lt;a href=\"Wallingford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Wallingford&lt;/a&gt; in 1449\u201350. He attended the Parliaments of 1447 and February 1449, though this appears to have been as Under-Treasurer rather than as an elected MP.\nHe served as &lt;a href=\"Treasurer%20of%20the%20Household\"&gt;Treasurer of the Household&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VI&lt;/a&gt;. He was knighted 1449/1451. During the reign of King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VI&lt;/a&gt;, his highest post was that of &lt;a href=\"Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer\"&gt;Under Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Marmaduke%20Lumley\"&gt;Marmaduke Lumley, Bishop of Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Exchequer\"&gt;Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;, which he held between February 1447 and July 1449. He was later Justice of Peace for &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; from 20 July 1454 till his death.\nBrowne remained loyal to Henry IV and Lancastrian forces as England became increasingly politically unstable, especially from 1453 after Henry's mental breakdowns, as tensions mounted between &lt;a href=\"Margaret_of_Anjou\"&gt;Queen Margaret&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard_of_York%2C_3rd_Duke_of_York\"&gt;Richard, Duke of York&lt;/a&gt; over control of the incapacitated King's government resulted with &lt;a href=\"Wars_of_the_Roses\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in 1455. Browne was pardoned by the Yorkist's in 1455, and 1458. He was &lt;a href=\"Henry_Holland%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Exeter\"&gt;Duke of Exeter&lt;/a&gt; right-hand man in 1460, unwavering to the Lancastrian cause when &lt;a href=\"Battle_of_Northampton_%281460%29\"&gt;Yorkist Earls (Warwick, Salisbury, and Edward)&lt;/a&gt; arrived in England. Browne assisted the effort by collecting men and broke the blockade during the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20the%20Tower%20of%20London%20%281460%29\"&gt;siege of the Tower of London (1460)&lt;/a&gt;. \nBrowne was convicted of &lt;a href=\"Treason_Act_1351\"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt; on 20 July 1460. According to some sources he was immediately executed by beheading, while according to other sources he and five others were executed at &lt;a href=\"Tyburn\"&gt;Tyburn&lt;/a&gt; by hanging on 29 July 1460.\nFamily.\nIn about 1437, Browne married Eleanor FitzAlan, daughter and heiress of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Fitzalan\"&gt;Sir Thomas FitzAlan&lt;/a&gt; of Betchworth Castle in Surrey, the third son of &lt;a href=\"John%20FitzAlan%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Arundel\"&gt;John FitzAlan, 2nd Baron Arundel&lt;/a&gt; (d.1390) by his wife &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20le%20Despenser\"&gt;Elizabeth le Despenser&lt;/a&gt; (d.1408). By Eleanor FitzAlan he had seven sons and two daughters:"
