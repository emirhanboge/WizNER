But Agbedi fell out with Governor Sylva and opted to resign his PDP chairmanship position after criticising Sylva that his government was failing. PDP leaders in the state including then vice president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan prevailed on Agbedi to remain in his position. In 2008, Governor Sylva instigated crisis in the party that led to the removal of Agbedi from office as Bayelsa State PDP Chairman in February that year.\nDG Governor Dickson campaign.\nAgbedi was Director General of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Dickson\"&gt;Siriake Dickson&lt;/a&gt; governorship campaign for his first and second term campaigns in 2012 and 2015.

He resigned from this position in 2014 to run for Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency in Bayelsa State.\nElection to House of Representatives.\nElection to the 3rd National Assembly in the 3rd Republic.\nAgbedi was first elected to the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria during the 3rd Assembly in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Nigerian%20Republic\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 representing Ekeremor Federal Constituency then of &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20State\"&gt;Rivers State&lt;/a&gt;. He held membership assignment on house committees on Public Accounts and Sports and Youth Development in the 3rd Assembly. Agbedi was the youngest member in the 3rd assembly. In 1993, the third republic was aborted after General &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Babangida\"&gt;Ibrahim Babangida&lt;/a&gt; annulled the disputed June 12, 1993 presidential election. &lt;a href=\"Moshood%20Abiola\"&gt;Moshood Kashmawo Abiola&lt;/a&gt; was the acclaimed winner of the election. Agbedi returned to his home state after the dissolution of the assembly and continued his grass root mobilisation under different community services retaining and gaining more of his grass root popularity until democracy returned in 1999.\nReturn to the National Assembly in the 4th Republic.\nAgbedi started the race to return to the national assembly in 2014 after resigning from his position in the government of Governor Siriake Dickson as senior special adviser on political matters.

His first attempt was in 2011 when he ran for the PDP nomination against incumbent Governor &lt;a href=\"Timipre%20Sylva\"&gt;Timipre Sylva&lt;/a&gt; who was running for a second term. It was widely speculated that Agbedi was being sponsored to run against governor Sylva by President Goodluck Jonathan. But agbedi denied that he was being sponsored by anyone. Ahead of the party primary, the PDP Screening Committee disqualified both Agbedi and Sylva from contesting in the party's primary. This ended Agbedi's first attempt to be governor of the state. Agbedi transferred his campaign structure and supporters to Siriake Dickson who eventually won the party's primary in 2011. Dickson in turn appointed Agbedi as Director General of his governorship campaign organisation and proceeded to victory in the general election.\n2019 Governorship race.\nIn 2019, Agbedi made a second attempt to be governor of Bayelsa. At a public declaration of interest to run for governor in July 2019, Agbedi declared himself the most qualified candidate. \u201cOf course, I consider myself popular to win election in Bayelsa, simply because the people know me for who I am. I have a character, I have exhibited transparency, I have exhibited sincerity and the people know that I can be trusted\u201d.\nAhead of his party's primary, several issues came up against Agbedi including the issue of zoning or rotation of governor among the three senatorial districts in the state. Agbedi from a zone that had already produced governors dismissed the zoning principle and continued his campaign.\nFew weeks to the party primary election, Governor Dickson announced three persons as his preferred candidates. Senator Douye Diri was one of the \u201cAnointed candidates\u201d. Agbedi reacted almost immediately describing the decision as \u201cfairy tale\u201d and said Dickson had no preferred candidates. Douye Diri won the primary election but the result was disputed saying Governor Dickson manipulated the process."
