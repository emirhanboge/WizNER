Distant cousins of the Apache are the &lt;a href=\"Navajo\"&gt;Navajo&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they share the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Athabaskan%20languages\"&gt;Southern Athabaskan languages&lt;/a&gt;. There are Apache communities in &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20reservation\"&gt;reservations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Apache people have moved throughout the United States and elsewhere, including urban centers. The Apache Nations are politically autonomous, speak several different languages, and have distinct cultures.\nHistorically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;, including areas in what is now Eastern Arizona, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Mexico\"&gt;Northern Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Texas\"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South-Central%20Colorado\"&gt;Southern Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. These areas are collectively known as &lt;a href=\"Apacheria\"&gt;Apacheria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Apache tribes fought the &lt;a href=\"Conquistador\"&gt;invading Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt; appear to have taken place during the late 17th century. In 19th-century confrontations during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Indian%20Wars\"&gt;American-Indian wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; found the Apache to be fierce &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and skillful strategists.\nContemporary tribes.\nThe following Apache tribes are &lt;a href=\"federally%20recognized%20tribe\"&gt;federally recognized&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Jicarilla are headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Dulce%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Dulce, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Mescalero\"&gt;Mescalero&lt;/a&gt; are headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Mescalero%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Mescalero, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The Western Apache, located in Arizona, is divided into several reservations, which crosscut cultural divisions. The Western Apache reservations include the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Apache%20Indian%20Reservation\"&gt;Fort Apache Indian Reservation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Carlos%20Apache%20Indian%20Reservation\"&gt;San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yavapai-Apache%20Nation\"&gt;Yavapai-Apache Nation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tonto%20Apache\"&gt;Tonto-Apache Reservation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Chiricahua were divided into two groups after they were released from being &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt;. The majority moved to the Mescalero Reservation and form, with the larger Mescalero political group, the &lt;a href=\"Mescalero\"&gt;Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Apache Reservation&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Lipan%20Apache%20people\"&gt;Lipan Apache&lt;/a&gt;. The other Chiricahua are enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sill%20Apache%20Tribe\"&gt;Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Apache%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Apache, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Plains%20Apache\"&gt;Plains Apache&lt;/a&gt; are located in Oklahoma, headquartered around &lt;a href=\"Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Anadarko&lt;/a&gt;, and are federally recognized as the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma.\nName.\nThe people who are known today as \"Apache\" were first encountered by the &lt;a href=\"conquistador\"&gt;conquistador&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish crown&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the term \"Apache\" has its roots in the Spanish language. The Spanish first used the term (Navajo) in the 1620s, referring to people in the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Chama%20%28Rio%20Grande%29\"&gt;Chama&lt;/a&gt; region east of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt;. By the 1640s, they applied the term to southern Athabaskan peoples from the Chama on the east to the San Juan on the west. The ultimate origin is uncertain and lost to Spanish history.\nModern Apache people use the Spanish term to refer to themselves and tribal functions, and so does the US government. However, Apache language speakers also refer to themselves and their people in the Apache term meaning 'person' or 'people'. Distant cousins and Apache subgroup, the Navajo, in their language refer to themselves as the .\nThe first known written record in Spanish is by in 1598. The most widely accepted origin theory suggests \"Apache\" was borrowed and transliterated from the &lt;a href=\"Zuni%20language\"&gt;Zuni&lt;/a&gt; word meaning \"Navajos\" (the plural of \"Navajo\").\nAnother theory suggests the term comes from &lt;a href=\"Yavapai%20language\"&gt;Yavapai&lt;/a&gt; meaning \"enemy\". The Zuni and Yavapai sources are less certain because O\u00f1ate used the term before he had encountered any Zuni or Yavapai. A less likely origin may be from Spanish , meaning \"raccoon\".\nThe fame of the tribes' tenacity and fighting skills, probably bolstered by &lt;a href=\"dime%20novel\"&gt;dime novel&lt;/a&gt;s, was widely known among Europeans. In early 20th century Parisian society, the word \"Apache\" was adopted into French, essentially meaning an outlaw.\nThe term \"Apachean\" includes the related &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20people\"&gt;Navajo people&lt;/a&gt;.\nDifficulties in naming.\nMany of the historical names of Apache groups that were recorded by non-Apache are difficult to match to modern-day tribes or their subgroups. Over the centuries, many Spanish, French and English-speaking authors did not differentiate between Apache and other semi-nomadic non-Apache peoples who might pass through the same area. Most commonly, Europeans learned to identify the tribes by translating their &lt;a href=\"exonym\"&gt;exonym&lt;/a&gt;, what another group whom the Europeans encountered first called the Apache peoples. Europeans often did not learn what the peoples called themselves, their &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aautonym\"&gt;autonym&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"anthropologist\"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt;s agree on some traditional major subgrouping of Apaches, they have often used different criteria to name finer divisions, and these do not always match modern Apache groupings. Some scholars do not consider groups residing in what is now Mexico to be Apache. In addition, an Apache individual has different ways of identification with a group, such as a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aband\"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the larger tribe or language grouping, which can add to the difficulties in an outsider comprehending the distinctions.\nIn 1900, the US government classified the members of the Apache tribe in the United States as &lt;a href=\"Pinal%20Coyotero\"&gt;Pinal Coyotero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jicarilla\"&gt;Jicarilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mescalero\"&gt;Mescalero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Carlos%20Apache\"&gt;San Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tonto%20Apache%20people\"&gt;Tonto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"White%20Mountain%20Apache%20people\"&gt;White Mountain&lt;/a&gt; Apache. The different groups were located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.\nIn the 1930s, the anthropologist &lt;a href=\"Greenville%20Goodwin\"&gt;Greenville Goodwin&lt;/a&gt; classified the Western Apache into five groups (based on his informants' views of &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt; and cultural differences): White Mountain, Cibecue, San Carlos, North Tonto, and South Tonto. Since then, other anthropologists (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Schroeder\"&gt;Albert Schroeder&lt;/a&gt;) consider Goodwin's classification inconsistent with pre-reservation cultural divisions. &lt;a href=\"Willem%20de%20Reuse\"&gt;Willem de Reuse&lt;/a&gt; finds linguistic evidence supporting only three major groupings: White Mountain, San Carlos, and Dilzhe'e (Tonto). He believes San Carlos is the most divergent dialect, and that Dilzhe'e is a remnant, intermediate member of a dialect continuum that previously spanned from the Western Apache language to the Navajo.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Upton%20Terrell\"&gt;John Upton Terrell&lt;/a&gt; classifies the Apache into western and eastern groups. In the western group, he includes Toboso, Cholome, Jocome, Sibolo or Cibola, Pelone, Manso, and Kiva or Kofa. He includes Chicame (the earlier term for Hispanized &lt;a href=\"Chicano\"&gt;Chicano&lt;/a&gt; or New Mexicans of Spanish/&lt;a href=\"Hispanic\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; and Apache descent) among them as having definite Apache connections or names which the Spanish associated with the Apache.\nIn a detailed study of &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Catholic Church records, David M. Brugge identifies 15 tribal names which the Spanish used to refer to the Apache. These were drawn from records of about 1000 baptisms from 1704 to 1862.\nList of names.\nThe list below is based on Foster and McCollough (2001), Opler (1983b, 1983c, 2001), and de Reuse (1983).\nThe term \"Apache\" refers to six major Apache-speaking groups: Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Plains Apache, and Western Apache. Historically, the term was also used for &lt;a href=\"Comanche\"&gt;Comanche&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mohave%20people\"&gt;Mojave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hualapai\"&gt;Hualapai&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Yavapai\"&gt;Yavapai&lt;/a&gt;s, none of whom speak Apache languages.\nJicarilla.\n&lt;a href=\"Jicarilla\"&gt;Jicarilla&lt;/a&gt; primarily live in Northern New Mexico, Southern Colorado, and the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Panhandle\"&gt;Texas Panhandle&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"jicarilla\" comes from the Spanish word for \"little gourd.\"\nLipan.\n&lt;a href=\"Lipan%20Apache%20people\"&gt;Lipan&lt;/a&gt; (also Ypandis, Ypandes, Ipandes, Ipandi, Lipanes, Lipanos, Lipaines, Lapane, Lipanis, etc.) live in Western Texas today. They traveled from the Pecos River in Eastern New Mexico to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29\"&gt;upper Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Saba%20River\"&gt;San Saba River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Llano%20River\"&gt;Llano River&lt;/a&gt; of central Texas across the Edwards Plateau southeast to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. They were close allies of the Natag\u00e9s. They were also called Plains Lipan (Golgah\u012f\u0301\u012f\u0301, K\u00f3'l kuk\u00e4'\u207f, \"Prairie Men\"), not to be confused with \"Lipiy\u00e1nes\" or \"Le Panis\" (French for the &lt;a href=\"Pawnee%20people\"&gt;Pawnee&lt;/a&gt;). They were first mentioned in 1718 records as being near the newly established town of &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Antonio, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMescalero.\n&lt;a href=\"Mescalero\"&gt;Mescalero&lt;/a&gt;s primarily live in Eastern New Mexico.\nEthnobotany.\nA full list of documented plant uses by the Mescalero tribe can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/11/ (which also includes the Chiricahua; 198 documented plant uses) and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/12/ (83 documented uses).\nPlains Apache.\n&lt;a href=\"Plains%20Apache\"&gt;Plains Apache&lt;/a&gt; (Kiowa-Apache, Naisha, Na\u02bcishandine) are headquartered in Southwest Oklahoma. Historically, they followed the &lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt;. Other names for them include N\u00e1'\u012f\u012fsha, N\u00e1'\u0119sha, Na'isha, Na'ishandine, Na-i-shan-dina, Na-ishi, Na-e-ca, N\u0105'ish\u0105\u0301, Nadeicha, Nardichia, Nad\u00edisha-d\u00e9na, Na'd\u00ed'\u012f\u0301sh\u0105\u0301\u02bc, N\u0105d\u00ed'\u012f\u012fsh\u0105\u0105, and Naisha.\nWestern Apache.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20Apache\"&gt;Western Apache&lt;/a&gt; include Northern Tonto, Southern Tonto, Cibecue, White Mountain and San Carlos groups. While these subgroups spoke the same language and had kinship ties, Western Apaches considered themselves as separate from each other, according to Goodwin. Other writers have used this term to refer to all non-Navajo Apachean peoples living west of the Rio Grande (thus failing to distinguish the Chiricahua from the other Apacheans). Goodwin's formulation: \"all those Apache peoples who have lived within the present boundaries of the state of Arizona during historic times with the exception of the Chiricahua, Warm Springs, and allied Apache, and a small band of Apaches known as the Apache Mansos, who lived in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nEntry into the Southwest.\nThe Apache and &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20people\"&gt;Navajo&lt;/a&gt; tribal groups of the North American Southwest speak related languages of the &lt;a href=\"Athabaskan\"&gt;Athabaskan&lt;/a&gt; language family. Other Athabaskan-speaking people in North America continue to reside in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest\"&gt;Northwest Pacific Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Anthropological evidence suggests that the Apache and Navajo peoples lived in these same northern locales before migrating to the Southwest sometime between AD 1200 and 1500.\nThe Apaches' nomadic way of life complicates accurate dating, primarily because they constructed less substantial dwellings than other Southwestern groups. Since the early 21st century, substantial progress has been made in dating and distinguishing their dwellings and other forms of material culture. They left behind a more austere set of tools and material goods than other Southwestern cultures.\nThe Athabaskan-speaking group probably moved into areas that were concurrently occupied or recently abandoned by other cultures. Other Athabaskan speakers, perhaps including the Southern Athabaskan, adapted many of their neighbors' technology and practices in their own cultures. Thus sites where early Southern Athabaskans may have lived are difficult to locate and even more difficult to firmly identify as culturally Southern Athabaskan. Recent advances have been made in the regard in the far southern portion of the American Southwest.\nThere are several hypotheses about Apache migrations. One posits that they moved into the Southwest from the Great Plains. In the mid-16th century, these mobile groups lived in tents, hunted &lt;a href=\"bison\"&gt;bison&lt;/a&gt; and other game, and used dogs to pull &lt;a href=\"travois\"&gt;travois&lt;/a&gt; loaded with their possessions. Substantial numbers of the people and a wide range were recorded by the Spanish in the 16th century.\nIn April 1541, while traveling on the plains east of the &lt;a href=\"Pueblo\"&gt;Pueblo&lt;/a&gt; region, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Coronado\"&gt;Francisco Coronado&lt;/a&gt; referred to the people as \"dog &lt;a href=\"nomad\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt;s.\" He wrote:\nThe Spanish described Plains &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;s as very white, with black spots, and \"not much larger than &lt;a href=\"Water%20dog\"&gt;water spaniel&lt;/a&gt;s.\" Plains dogs were slightly smaller than those used for hauling loads by modern Inuit and northern First Nations people in Canada. Recent experiments show these dogs may have pulled loads up to 50 &lt;a href=\"Pound%20%28mass%29\"&gt;lb&lt;/a&gt; (20\u00a0kg) on long trips, at rates as high as two or three miles per hour (3 to 5\u00a0km/h). The Plains migration theory associates the Apache peoples with the &lt;a href=\"Dismal%20River%20culture\"&gt;Dismal River culture&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20culture\"&gt;archaeological culture&lt;/a&gt; known primarily from ceramics and house remains, dated 1675\u20131725, which has been excavated in &lt;a href=\"Nebraska\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, eastern Colorado, and western &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the first documentary sources mention the Apache, and historians have suggested some passages indicate a 16th-century entry from the north, archaeological data indicate they were present on the plains long before this first reported contact.\nA competing theory posits their migration south, through the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountains\"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately reaching the American Southwest by the 14th century or perhaps earlier. An archaeological material culture assemblage identified in this mountainous zone as ancestral Apache has been referred to as the \"Cerro Rojo complex\". This theory does not preclude arrival via a plains route as well, perhaps concurrently, but to date the earliest evidence has been found in the mountainous Southwest. The Plains Apache have a significant Southern Plains cultural influence.\nWhen the Spanish arrived in the area, trade between the long established Pueblo peoples and the Southern Athabaskan was well established. They reported the Pueblo exchanged &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; and woven &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; goods for bison meat, and hides and materials for stone tools. Coronado observed the Plains people wintering near the Pueblo in established camps. Later Spanish sovereignty over the area disrupted trade between the Pueblo and the diverging Apache and Navajo groups. The Apache quickly acquired horses, improving their mobility for quick raids on settlements. In addition, the Pueblo were forced to work Spanish mission lands and care for mission flocks; they had fewer surplus goods to trade with their neighbors.\nIn 1540, Coronado reported that the modern Western Apache area was uninhabited, although some scholars have argued that he simply did not see the American Indians. Other Spanish explorers first mention \"Querechos\" living west of the Rio Grande in the 1580s. To some historians, this implies the Apaches moved into their current Southwestern homelands in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Other historians note that Coronado reported that Pueblo women and children had often been evacuated by the time his party attacked their dwellings, and that he saw some dwellings had been recently abandoned as he moved up the Rio Grande. This might indicate the semi-nomadic Southern Athabaskan had advance warning about his hostile approach and evaded encounter with the Spanish. Archaeologists are finding ample evidence of an early proto-Apache presence in the Southwestern mountain zone in the 15th century and perhaps earlier. The Apache presence on both the Plains and in the mountainous Southwest indicate that the people took multiple early migration routes.\nConflict with Mexico and the United States.\nIn general, the recently arrived Spanish colonists, who settled in villages, and Apache bands developed a pattern of interaction over a few centuries. Both raided and traded with each other. Records of the period seem to indicate that relationships depended on the specific villages and bands: a band might be friends with one village and raid another. When war occurred, the Spanish would send troops; after a battle both sides would \"sign a treaty\" and go home.\nThe traditional and sometimes treacherous relationships continued after the independence of Mexico in 1821. By 1835 Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps (see &lt;a href=\"scalping\"&gt;scalping&lt;/a&gt;), but certain villages still traded with some bands. When &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Comp%C3%A0\"&gt;Juan Jos\u00e9 Comp\u00e0&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Copper Mines &lt;a href=\"Mimbre%C3%B1o%20Apaches\"&gt;Mimbre\u00f1o Apaches&lt;/a&gt;, was killed for bounty money in 1837, \"&lt;a href=\"Mangas%20Coloradas\"&gt;Mangas Coloradas&lt;/a&gt;\" (Red Sleeves) or \"Dasoda-hae\" (He just sits there) became the principal chief and war leader; also in 1837 &lt;a href=\"Soldado%20Fiero\"&gt;Soldado Fiero&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Fuerte), leader of the Warm Springs &lt;a href=\"Mimbre%C3%B1o%20Apaches\"&gt;Mimbre\u00f1o Apaches&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by Mexican soldiers near Janos, and his son \"&lt;a href=\"Cuchillo%20Negro\"&gt;Cuchillo Negro&lt;/a&gt;\" (Black Knife) became the principal chief and war leader. They (being now Mangas Coloradas the first chief and Cuchillo Negro the second chief of the whole Tchihende or Mimbre\u00f1o people) conducted a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans. By 1856, authorities in horse-rich &lt;a href=\"Durango\"&gt;Durango&lt;/a&gt; would claim that Indian raids (mostly Comanche and Apache) in their state had taken nearly 6,000 lives, abducted 748 people, and forced the abandonment of 358 settlements over the previous 20 years.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;United States went to war against Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 1846, many Apache bands promised U.S. soldiers safe passage through their lands. When the U.S. claimed former territories of Mexico in 1846, \"Mangas Coloradas\" signed a peace treaty with the nation, respecting them as conquerors of the Mexicans' land. An uneasy peace with U.S. citizens held until the 1850s. An influx of gold miners into the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Rita%20Mountains\"&gt;Santa Rita Mountains&lt;/a&gt; led to conflict with the Apache. This period is sometimes called the &lt;a href=\"Apache%20Wars\"&gt;Apache Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnited States' concept of a &lt;a href=\"Indian%20reservation\"&gt;reservation&lt;/a&gt; had not been used by the Spanish, Mexicans or other Apache neighbors before. Reservations were often badly managed, and bands that had no kinship relationships were forced to live together. No fences existed to keep people in or out. It was common for a band to be allowed to leave for a short period of time. Other times a band would leave without permission, to raid, return to their homeland to forage, or to simply get away. The U.S. military usually had forts nearby to keep the bands on the reservations by finding and returning those who left. The reservation policies of the U.S. caused conflict and war with the various Apache bands who left the reservations for almost another quarter century.\nWar between the Apache peoples and Euro-Americans has led to a stereotypical focus on certain aspects of Apache cultures. These have often been distorted through misunderstanding of their cultures, as noted by &lt;a href=\"anthropology\"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keith%20H.%20Basso\"&gt;Keith Basso&lt;/a&gt;:\nForced removal.\nIn 1875, United States military forced the removal of an estimated 1500 &lt;a href=\"Yavapai-Apache%20Nation\"&gt;Yavapai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tonto%20Apache%20people\"&gt;Dilzhe'e Apache&lt;/a&gt; (better known as \"Tonto Apache\") from the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20McDowell%20Yavapai%20Nation\"&gt;Rio Verde Indian Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and its several thousand acres of treaty lands promised to them by the United States government. At the orders of Indian Commissioner L.E. Dudley, U.S. Army troops made the people, young and old, walk through winter-flooded rivers, mountain passes and narrow canyon trails to get to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Carlos%20Apache%20Indian%20Reservation\"&gt;Indian Agency at San Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, away. The trek killed several hundred people. The people were interned there for 25 years while white settlers took over their land. Only a few hundred ever returned to their lands. At the San Carlos reservation, the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20soldiers\"&gt;Buffalo soldiers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"9th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;9th Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;\u2014replacing the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Cavalry%20Regiment\"&gt;8th Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; who were being stationed to Texas\u2014guarded the Apaches from 1875 to 1881.\nBeginning in 1879, an Apache uprising against the reservation system led to &lt;a href=\"Victorio%27s%20War\"&gt;Victorio's War&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Victorio\"&gt;Chief Victorio's&lt;/a&gt; band of Apaches and the 9th Cavalry.\nDefeat.\nMost United States' histories of this era report that the final defeat of an Apache band took place when 5,000 US troops forced &lt;a href=\"Geronimo\"&gt;Geronimo&lt;/a&gt;'s group of 30 to 50 men, women and children to surrender on September 4, 1886, at &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Canyon\"&gt;Skeleton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. The Army sent this band and the Chiricahua scouts who had tracked them to military confinement in &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Pickens\"&gt;Fort Pickens&lt;/a&gt; and, subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Ft.%20Sill\"&gt;Ft. Sill&lt;/a&gt;, Oklahoma.\nMany books were written on the stories of hunting and trapping during the late 19th century. Many of these stories involve Apache raids and the failure of agreements with Americans and Mexicans. In the post-war era, the US government arranged for Apache children to be taken from their families for adoption by &lt;a href=\"white%20American\"&gt;white American&lt;/a&gt;s in assimilation programs.\nPre-reservation culture.\nSocial organization.\nAll Apache peoples lived in extended family units (or \"family clusters\"); they usually lived close together, with each nuclear family in separate dwellings. An extended family generally consisted of a husband and wife, their unmarried children, their married daughters, their married daughters' husbands, and their married daughters' children. Thus, the extended family is connected through a lineage of women who live together (that is, matrilocal residence), into which men may enter upon marriage (leaving behind his parents' family).\nWhen a daughter married, a new dwelling was built nearby for her and her husband. Among the Navajo, residence rights are ultimately derived from a head mother. Although the Western Apache usually practiced matrilocal residence, sometimes the eldest son chose to bring his wife to live with his parents after marriage. All tribes practiced &lt;a href=\"sororate%20marriage\"&gt;sororate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"levirate%20marriage\"&gt;levirate&lt;/a&gt; marriages.\nApache men practiced varying degrees of \"avoidance\" of his wife's close relatives, a practice often most strictly observed by distance between mother-in-law and son-in-law. The degree of avoidance differed by Apache group. The most elaborate system was among the Chiricahua, where men had to use indirect polite speech toward and were not allowed to be within visual sight of the wife's female relatives, whom he had to avoid. His female Chiricahua relatives through marriage also avoided him.\nSeveral extended families worked together as a \"local group\", which carried out certain ceremonies, and economic and military activities. Political control was mostly present at the local group level. Local groups were headed by a &lt;a href=\"Tribal%20chief\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt;, a male who had much influence due to his effectiveness and reputation. The position was not &lt;a href=\"hereditary\"&gt;hereditary&lt;/a&gt;, and was often filled by members of different extended families. The chief's influence was as strong as he was evaluated to be\u2014no group member was obliged to follow the chief. Western Apache criteria for a good chief included: industriousness, generosity, impartiality, forbearance, conscientiousness, and eloquence in language.\nMany Apache peoples joined several local groups into \"&lt;a href=\"band%20society\"&gt;bands&lt;/a&gt;\". Banding was strongest among the Chiricahua and Western Apache, and weak among the Lipan and Mescalero. The Navajo did not organize into bands, perhaps because of the requirements of the &lt;a href=\"sheepherd\"&gt;sheepherd&lt;/a&gt;ing economy. However, the Navajo did have \"the outfit\", a group of relatives that was larger than the extended family, but smaller than a local group community or a band.\nOn a larger level, Western Apache bands organized into what &lt;a href=\"Grenville%20Goodwin\"&gt;Grenville Goodwin&lt;/a&gt; called \"groups\". He reported five groups for the Western Apache: Northern Tonto, Southern Tonto, Cibecue, San Carlos, and White Mountain. The Jicarilla grouped their bands into \"&lt;a href=\"Kinship%23Lineages%2C%20clans%2C%20phratries%2C%20moieties%2C%20and%20matrimonial%20sides\"&gt;moieties&lt;/a&gt;\", perhaps influenced by the northeastern &lt;a href=\"Pueblo\"&gt;Pueblo&lt;/a&gt;. The Western Apache and Navajo also had a system of &lt;a href=\"matrilineal\"&gt;matrilineal&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s\" organized further into \"&lt;a href=\"phratries\"&gt;phratries&lt;/a&gt;\" (perhaps influenced by the western Pueblo).\nThe notion of \"&lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;\" in Apache cultures is very weakly developed; essentially it was only a recognition \"that one owed a modicum of hospitality to those of the same speech, dress, and customs.\" The six Apache tribes had political independence from each other and even fought against each other. For example, the Lipan once fought against the Mescalero.\nKinship systems.\nThe Apache tribes have two distinctly different &lt;a href=\"kinship%20term\"&gt;kinship term&lt;/a&gt; systems: a \"Chiricahua type\" and a \"Jicarilla type.\" The Chiricahua-type system is used by the Chiricahua, Mescalero, and Western Apache. The Western Apache system differs slightly from the other two systems, and has some similarities to the Navajo system.\nThe Jicarilla type, which is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sioux\"&gt;Dakota&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Iroquois\"&gt;Iroquois&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iroquois%20kinship\"&gt;kinship systems&lt;/a&gt;, is used by the Jicarilla, Navajo, Lipan, and Plains Apache. The Navajo system is more divergent among the four, having similarities with the Chiricahua-type system. The Lipan and Plains Apache systems are very similar.\nChiricahua.\nThe Chiricahua language has four words for &lt;a href=\"grandparent\"&gt;grandparent&lt;/a&gt;: \"-ch\u00fa\" \"maternal grandmother\", \"-ts\u00fay\u00e9\" \"maternal grandfather\", \"-ch\u02bcin\u00e9\" \"paternal grandmother\", \"-n\u00e1l\u00e9\" \"paternal grandfather\". Additionally, a grandparent's siblings are identified by the same word; thus, one's maternal grandmother, one's maternal grandmother's sisters, and one's maternal grandmother's brothers are all called \"-ch\u00fa\". Furthermore, the grandchild terms are reciprocal, that is, one uses the same term to refer to their grandchild. For example, a person's maternal grandmother is called \"-ch\u00fa\" and that grandmother also calls that granddaughter \"-ch\u00fa\" (i.e. \"-ch\u00fa\" can mean the child of either your own daughter or your sibling's daughter.)\nChiricahua cousins are not distinguished from &lt;a href=\"sibling\"&gt;sibling&lt;/a&gt;s through kinship terms. Thus, the same word refers to either a sibling or a &lt;a href=\"cousin\"&gt;cousin&lt;/a&gt; (there are not separate terms for &lt;a href=\"parallel-cousin\"&gt;parallel-cousin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cross-cousin\"&gt;cross-cousin&lt;/a&gt;). The terms depend on the sex of the speaker (unlike the English terms \"brother\" and \"sister\"): \"-k\u02bcis\" \"same-sex sibling or same-sex cousin\", \"-\u00b4-l\u0105h\" \"opposite-sex sibling or opposite-sex cousin\". This means if one is a male, then one's brother is called \"-k\u02bcis\" and one's sister is called \"-\u00b4-l\u0105h\". If one is a female, then one's brother is called \"-\u00b4-l\u0105h\" and one's sister is called \"-k\u02bcis\". Chiricahuas in a \"-\u00b4-l\u0105h\" relationship observed great restraint and respect toward that relative; cousins (but not siblings) in a \"-\u00b4-l\u0105h\" relationship may practice total \"avoidance\".\nTwo different words are used for each parent according to sex: \"-m\u00e1\u00e1\u02bc\" \"mother\", \"-taa\" \"father\". Likewise, there are two words for a parent's child according to sex: \"-y\u00e1ch\u02bce\u02bc\" \"daughter\", \"-ghe\u02bc\" \"son\".\nA parent's siblings are classified together regardless of sex: \"-gh\u00fay\u00e9\" \"maternal aunt or uncle (mother's brother or sister)\", \"-deed\u00e9\u00e9\u02bc\" \"paternal aunt or uncle (father's brother or sister)\". These two terms are reciprocal like the grandparent/grandchild terms. Thus, \"-gh\u00fay\u00e9\" also refers to one's opposite-sex sibling's son or daughter (that is, a person will call their maternal aunt \"-gh\u00fay\u00e9\" and that aunt will call them \"-gh\u00fay\u00e9\" in return).\nEthnobotany.\nA list of 198 ethnobotany plant uses for the Chiricahua can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/11/, which also includes the Mescalero.\nJicarilla.\nUnlike the Chiricahua system, the Jicarilla have only two terms for grandparents according to sex: \"-ch\u00f3\u00f3\" \"grandmother\", \"-ts\u00f3y\u00e9\u00e9\" \"grandfather\". They do not have separate terms for maternal or paternal grandparents. The terms are also used of a grandparent's siblings according to sex. Thus, \"-ch\u00f3\u00f3\" refers to one's grandmother or one's grand-aunt (either maternal or paternal); \"-ts\u00f3y\u00e9\u00e9\" refers to one's grandfather or one's grand-uncle. These terms are not reciprocal. There is a single word for grandchild (regardless of sex): \"-ts\u00f3y\u00ed\u0331\u00ed\u0331\".\nThere are two terms for each parent. These terms also refer to that parent's same-sex sibling: \"-\u02bcn\u00ed\u00edh\" \"mother or maternal aunt (mother's sister)\", \"-ka\u02bc\u00e9\u00e9\" \"father or paternal uncle (father's brother)\". Additionally, there are two terms for a parent's opposite-sex sibling depending on sex: \"-da\u02bc\u00e1\u0331\u00e1\u0331\" \"maternal uncle (mother's brother)\", \"-b\u00e9j\u00e9\u00e9\" \"paternal aunt (father's sister).\nTwo terms are used for same-sex and opposite-sex siblings. These terms are also used for &lt;a href=\"parallel-cousin\"&gt;parallel-cousin&lt;/a&gt;s: \"-k\u02bcis\u00e9\" \"same-sex sibling or same-sex parallel cousin (i.e. same-sex father's brother's child or mother's sister's child)\", \"-\u00b4-l\u00e1h\" \"opposite-sex sibling or opposite parallel cousin (i.e. opposite-sex father's brother's child or mother's sister's child)\". These two terms can also be used for &lt;a href=\"cross-cousin\"&gt;cross-cousin&lt;/a&gt;s. There are also three sibling terms based on the age relative to the speaker: \"-nd\u00e1d\u00e9\u00e9\" \"older sister\", \"-\u00b4-na\u02bc\u00e1\u0331\u00e1\u0331\" \"older brother\", \"-shd\u00e1\u0331zha\" \"younger sibling (i.e. younger sister or brother)\". Additionally, there are separate words for cross-cousins: \"-zeed\u0144\" \"cross-cousin (either same-sex or opposite-sex of speaker)\", \"-i\u0142naa\u02bcaash\" \"male cross-cousin\" (only used by male speakers).\nA parent's child is classified with their same-sex sibling's or same-sex cousin's child: \"-zh\u00e1che\u02bce\" \"daughter, same-sex sibling's daughter, same-sex cousin's daughter\", \"-ghe\u02bc\" \"son, same-sex sibling's son, same-sex cousin's son\". There are different words for an opposite-sex sibling's child: \"-da\u02bc\u00e1\u0331\u00e1\u0331\" \"opposite-sex sibling's daughter\", \"-da\u02bc\" \"opposite-sex sibling's son\".\nHousing.\nApache lived in three types of houses. &lt;a href=\"Teepee\"&gt;Teepee&lt;/a&gt;s were common in the plains. W&lt;a href=\"Wigwam\"&gt;ickiups&lt;/a&gt; were common in the highlands; these were framed of wood held together with yucca fibers and covered in brush. If a family member died, the wickiup would be burned. Apache of the desert of northern Mexico lived in &lt;a href=\"hogan\"&gt;hogan&lt;/a&gt;s, an earthen structure for keeping cool.\nBelow is a description of Chiricahua wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler:\nRecent research has documented the archaeological remains of Chiricahua Apache wickiups as found on protohistoric and at historical sites, such as Canon de los Embudos where C.S. Fly photographed Geronimo, his people, and dwellings during surrender negotiations in 1886, demonstrating their unobtrusive and improvised nature.\"\nFood.\nApache people obtained food from four main sources:\nParticular types of foods eaten by a group depending upon their respective environment.\nHunting.\nHunting was done primarily by men, although there were sometimes exceptions depending on animal and culture (e.g. Lipan women could help in hunting rabbits and Chiricahua boys were also allowed to hunt rabbits).\nHunting often had elaborate preparations, such as &lt;a href=\"fasting\"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; and religious rituals performed by &lt;a href=\"Medicine%20man\"&gt;medicine men&lt;/a&gt; before and after the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals to ensure smooth hunting. Slaughter follows religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) prescribing cutting, prayers, and bone disposal. Southern Athabascan hunters often distributed successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as half of his kill with a fellow hunter and needy people at the camp. Feelings of individuals about this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.\nThe most common hunting weapon before the introduction of European guns was the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;bow and arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Various hunting techniques were used. Some involved wearing animal head masks as a disguise. Whistles were sometimes used to lure animals closer. Another technique was the relay method where hunters positioned at various points would chase the prey in turns in order to tire the animal. A similar method involved chasing the prey down a steep cliff.\nEating certain animals was taboo. Although different cultures had different taboos, common examples included bears, peccaries, turkeys, fish, snakes, insects, owls, and coyotes. An example of taboo differences: the black bear was a part of the Lipan diet (although less common as buffalo, deer, or antelope), but the Jicarilla never ate bear because it was considered an evil animal. Some taboos were a regional phenomenon, such as fish, which was taboo throughout the southwest (e.g. in certain Pueblo cultures like the &lt;a href=\"Hopi\"&gt;Hopi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zuni%20people\"&gt;Zuni&lt;/a&gt;) and considered to resemble a snake (an evil animal) in physical appearance.\nWestern Apache hunted deer and &lt;a href=\"pronghorn\"&gt;pronghorn&lt;/a&gt;s mostly in the ideal late fall. After the meat was smoked into jerky around November, they migrated from the farm sites in the mountains along stream banks to winter camps in the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20River%20%28Arizona%29\"&gt;Salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20River%20%28Arizona%29\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gila%20river\"&gt;Gila river&lt;/a&gt; and even the Colorado River valleys.\nThe Chiricahua mostly hunted deer followed by pronghorn. Lesser game included &lt;a href=\"cottontail%20rabbit\"&gt;cottontail rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s (but not &lt;a href=\"jack%20rabbit\"&gt;jack rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"opossum\"&gt;opossum&lt;/a&gt;s, squirrels, surplus horses, surplus mules, \"wapiti\" (elk), wild cattle and &lt;a href=\"wood%20rat\"&gt;wood rat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Mescalero primarily hunted deer. Other game includes: &lt;a href=\"bighorn%20sheep\"&gt;bighorn sheep&lt;/a&gt;, buffalo (for those living closer to the plains), cottontail rabbits, elk, horses, mules, opossums, pronghorn, wild steers and wood rats. Beavers, minks, muskrats, and weasels were hunted for their hides but body parts but were not eaten.\nThe Jicarilla primarily hunted bighorn sheep, buffalo, deer, elk and pronghorn. Other game included beaver, bighorn sheep, chief hares, chipmunks, doves, ground hogs, grouse, peccaries, porcupines, prairie dogs, quail, rabbits, skunks, snow birds, squirrels, turkeys and wood rats. Burros and horses were only eaten in emergencies. Minks, weasels, wildcats and wolves were not eaten but hunted for their body parts.\nThe Lipan ate mostly buffalo with a three-week hunt during the fall and smaller hunts until the spring. The second most utilized animal was deer. Fresh &lt;a href=\"Deer%20Blood\"&gt;deer blood&lt;/a&gt; was drunk for health. Other animals included beavers, bighorns, black bears, burros, ducks, elk, fish, horses, mountain lions, mourning doves, mules, prairie dogs, pronghorns, quail, rabbits, squirrels, turkeys, turtles and wood rats. Skunks were eaten only in emergencies.\nPlains Apache hunters hunted primarily buffalo and deer. Other game were badgers, bears, beavers, fowls, geese, opossums, otters, rabbits and turtles.\nClothing.\nInfluenced by the Plains Indians, Western Apaches wore animal hide decorated with seed beads for clothing. These beaded designs historically resembled that of the Great Basin Paiute and is characterized by linear patterning. Apache beaded clothing was bordered with narrow bands of glass &lt;a href=\"seed%20bead\"&gt;seed bead&lt;/a&gt;s in diagonal stripes of alternating colors. They made buckskin shirts, ponchos, skirts and moccasins and decorated them with colorful beadwork.\nUndomesticated plants and other food sources.\nThe gathering of plants and other food was primarily done by women. The men's job was usually to hunt animals such as deer, buffalo, and small game. However, men helped in certain gathering activities, such as of heavy &lt;a href=\"agave\"&gt;agave&lt;/a&gt; crowns. Numerous plants were used as both food and medicine and in religious ceremonies. Other plants were used for only their religious or medicinal value.\nIn May, the Western Apache baked and dried agave crowns pounded into pulp and formed into rectangular cakes. At the end of June and beginning of July, &lt;a href=\"saguaro\"&gt;saguaro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"opuntia\"&gt;prickly pear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cylindropuntia\"&gt;cholla&lt;/a&gt; fruits were gathered. In July and August, &lt;a href=\"mesquite\"&gt;mesquite&lt;/a&gt; beans, &lt;a href=\"Hesperoyucca%20whipplei\"&gt;Spanish bayonet&lt;/a&gt; fruit, and &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20emoryi\"&gt;Emory oak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"acorn\"&gt;acorn&lt;/a&gt;s were gathered. In late September, gathering was stopped as attention moved to harvesting cultivated crops. In late fall, &lt;a href=\"juniper%20berries\"&gt;juniper berries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pinyon%20pine\"&gt;pinyon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pine%20nut\"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; were gathered.\nThe most important plant food for the Chiricahua was the &lt;a href=\"Century%20plant\"&gt;Century plant&lt;/a&gt; (also known as &lt;a href=\"Agave%20parryi\"&gt;mescal&lt;/a&gt; or agave). The crowns (the &lt;a href=\"tuberous\"&gt;tuberous&lt;/a&gt; base portion) were baked in large underground ovens and sun-dried. The shoots were also eaten. Other plants used by the Chiricahua include: &lt;a href=\"Mahonia%20trifoliolata\"&gt;agarita&lt;/a&gt; (or algerita) berries, &lt;a href=\"Juniperus%20deppeana\"&gt;alligator juniper&lt;/a&gt; berries, &lt;a href=\"Matelea%20producta\"&gt;anglepod&lt;/a&gt; seeds, &lt;a href=\"Yucca%20baccata\"&gt;banana yucca&lt;/a&gt; (or datil, broadleaf yucca) fruit, &lt;a href=\"chili%20pepper\"&gt;chili pepper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Prunus%20virginiana\"&gt;chokecherries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cota%20%28plant%29\"&gt;cota&lt;/a&gt; (used for tea), &lt;a href=\"Ribes\"&gt;currant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sporobolus\"&gt;dropseed grass&lt;/a&gt; seeds, &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20gambelii\"&gt;Gambel oak&lt;/a&gt; acorns, Gambel oak bark (used for tea), grass seeds (of various varieties), &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20vegetable\"&gt;greens&lt;/a&gt; (of various varieties), &lt;a href=\"Crataegus\"&gt;hawthorne&lt;/a&gt; fruit, &lt;a href=\"Chenopodium%20berlandieri\"&gt;Lamb's-quarters&lt;/a&gt; leaves, &lt;a href=\"Cheilanthes\"&gt;lip ferns&lt;/a&gt; (used for tea), &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20turbinella\"&gt;live oak&lt;/a&gt; acorns, &lt;a href=\"Robinia%20neomexicana\"&gt;locust&lt;/a&gt; blossoms, locust pods, &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; kernels (used for &lt;a href=\"tiswin\"&gt;tiswin&lt;/a&gt;), and mesquite beans.\nAlso eaten were &lt;a href=\"Mulberry\"&gt;mulberries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yucca%20angustissima\"&gt;narrowleaf yucca&lt;/a&gt; blossoms, narrowleaf yucca stalks, &lt;a href=\"Mammillaria\"&gt;nipple cactus&lt;/a&gt; fruit, &lt;a href=\"Juniperus%20monosperma\"&gt;one-seed juniper&lt;/a&gt; berries, onions, &lt;a href=\"Chenopodium%20album\"&gt;pigweed&lt;/a&gt; seeds, pinyon nuts, &lt;a href=\"pitahaya\"&gt;pitahaya&lt;/a&gt; fruit, prickly pear fruit, prickly pear juice, raspberries, &lt;a href=\"Prosopis%20pubescens\"&gt;screwbean&lt;/a&gt; (or tornillo) fruit, saguaro fruit, &lt;a href=\"spurge\"&gt;spurge&lt;/a&gt; seeds, strawberries, &lt;a href=\"Rhus%20trilobata\"&gt;sumac&lt;/a&gt; (\"Rhus trilobata\") berries, &lt;a href=\"sunflower%20seed\"&gt;sunflower seed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tule\"&gt;tule&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rootstock\"&gt;rootstock&lt;/a&gt;s, tule shoots, &lt;a href=\"Amaranthus%20albus\"&gt;pigweed tumbleweed&lt;/a&gt; seeds, &lt;a href=\"Proboscidea%20%28plant%29\"&gt;unicorn plant&lt;/a&gt; seeds, walnuts, &lt;a href=\"Ponderosa%20Pine\"&gt;western yellow pine&lt;/a&gt; inner bark (used as a sweetener), western yellow pine nuts, &lt;a href=\"Ipomoea%20lacunosa\"&gt;whitestar potatoes&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ipomoea lacunosa\"), &lt;a href=\"Vitis\"&gt;wild grapes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solanum%20jamesii\"&gt;wild potato&lt;/a&gt;es (\"Solanum jamesii\"), &lt;a href=\"Oxalis\"&gt;wood sorrel&lt;/a&gt; leaves, and &lt;a href=\"yucca\"&gt;yucca&lt;/a&gt; buds (unknown species). Other items include: honey from ground hives and hives found within agave, &lt;a href=\"Dasylirion%20wheeleri\"&gt;sotol&lt;/a&gt;, and narrowleaf yucca plants.\nThe abundant agave (mescal) was also important to the Mescalero, who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared. The smaller sotol crowns were also important. The crowns of both plants were baked and dried. Other plants include: acorns, agarita berries, &lt;a href=\"amole\"&gt;amole&lt;/a&gt; stalks (roasted and peeled), &lt;a href=\"aspen\"&gt;aspen&lt;/a&gt; inner bark (used as a sweetener), &lt;a href=\"Nolina\"&gt;bear grass&lt;/a&gt; stalks (roasted and peeled), &lt;a href=\"Acer%20negundo\"&gt;box elder&lt;/a&gt; inner bark (used as a sweetener), banana yucca fruit, banana yucca flowers, box elder sap (used as a sweetener), cactus fruits (of various varieties), &lt;a href=\"cattail\"&gt;cattail&lt;/a&gt; rootstocks, chokecherries, currants, &lt;a href=\"Sporobolus\"&gt;dropseed grass&lt;/a&gt; seeds (used for &lt;a href=\"flatbread\"&gt;flatbread&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Sambucus%20nigra\"&gt;elderberries&lt;/a&gt;, gooseberries (\"&lt;a href=\"Ribes%20leptanthum\"&gt;Ribes leptanthum&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ribes%20pinetorum\"&gt;R. pinetorum&lt;/a&gt;\"), grapes, &lt;a href=\"Celtis\"&gt;hackberries&lt;/a&gt;, hawthorne fruit, and &lt;a href=\"hops\"&gt;hops&lt;/a&gt; (used as condiment).\nThey also used &lt;a href=\"Monarda\"&gt;horsemint&lt;/a&gt; (as a condiment), juniper berries, Lamb's-quarters leaves, locust flowers, locust pods, mesquite pods, mint (as a condiment), mulberries, &lt;a href=\"Mentha%20pulegium\"&gt;pennyroyal&lt;/a&gt; (as a condiment), pigweed seeds (for flatbread), pine inner bark (as a sweetener), pinyon pine nuts, prickly pear fruit (dethorned and roasted), &lt;a href=\"Portulaca%20oleracea\"&gt;purslane&lt;/a&gt; leaves, raspberries, &lt;a href=\"Salvia\"&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt; (as a condiment), screwbeans, &lt;a href=\"Cyperaceae\"&gt;sedge&lt;/a&gt; tubers, &lt;a href=\"Capsella%20bursa-pastoris\"&gt;shepherd's purse&lt;/a&gt; leaves, strawberries, sunflower seeds, tumbleweed seeds (for flatbread), &lt;a href=\"vetch\"&gt;vetch&lt;/a&gt; pods, walnuts, &lt;a href=\"western%20white%20pine\"&gt;western white pine&lt;/a&gt; nuts, western yellow pine nuts, white &lt;a href=\"Oenothera\"&gt;evening primrose&lt;/a&gt; fruit, &lt;a href=\"Cymopterus%20acaulis\"&gt;wild celery&lt;/a&gt; (as a condiment), &lt;a href=\"Allium\"&gt;wild onion&lt;/a&gt; (as a condiment), wild pea pods, wild potatoes, and wood sorrel leaves.\nThe Jicarilla used acorns, chokecherries, juniper berries, mesquite beans, pinyon nuts, prickly pear fruit, yucca fruit, and many other kinds of fruits, acorns, greens, nuts, and seed grasses.\nThe Lipan heavily used agave (mescal) and sotol. Other plants include agarita, blackberries, cattails, devil's claw, elderberries, gooseberries, hackberries, hawthorn, juniper, Lamb's-quarters, locust, mesquite, mulberries, &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabal\"&gt;palmetto&lt;/a&gt;, pecan, pinyon, prickly pears, raspberries, screwbeans, seed grasses, strawberries, sumac, sunflowers, &lt;a href=\"Diospyros%20texana\"&gt;Texas persimmons&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts, western yellow pine, wild cherries, wild grapes, wild onions, wild plums, wild potatoes, &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20arkansana\"&gt;wild rose&lt;/a&gt;s, yucca flowers, and yucca fruit. Other gathered food includes salt obtained from caves and honey.\nThe Plains Apache gathered chokecherries, blackberries, grapes, &lt;a href=\"Psoralea%20esculenta\"&gt;prairie turnip&lt;/a&gt;s, wild onions, and wild plums, and many other fruits, vegetables, and tuberous roots.\nEthnobotany of Apache.\nThis is a list of 54 ethnobotany plant uses for the uncategorized Apache. http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/10/.\nCrop cultivation.\nThe Navajo practiced the most crop cultivation, the Western Apache, Jicarilla, and Lipan less. The one Chiricahua band (of Opler's) and the Mescalero practiced very little cultivation. The other two Chiricahua bands and the Plains Apache did not grow any crops.\nTrade, raids, and war.\nInterchanges between the Apache and European-descended explorers and settlers included trading. The Apache found they could use European and American goods.\nUnlike Europeans and Euro-Americans, Apaches distinguished raiding from war. Raiding was done in small parties with a specific economic purpose. War was waged in large parties (often clan members), usually to achieve retribution. Raiding was traditional for the Apache, but Mexican settlers objected to their stock being stolen. As tensions grew between the Apache and settlers, the Mexican government passed laws offering cash rewards for Apache scalps.\nReligion.\nApache &lt;a href=\"mythology\"&gt;religious stories&lt;/a&gt; relate to two &lt;a href=\"culture%20hero\"&gt;culture hero&lt;/a&gt;es (one of the Sun/fire:\"Killer-Of-Enemies/Monster Slayer\", and one of Water/Moon/thunder: \"Child-Of-The-Water/Born For Water\") who destroy several creatures harmful to humankind.\nAnother story is of a hidden ball game, where good and evil animals decide whether or not the world should be forever dark. &lt;a href=\"Coyote%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Coyote&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"trickster\"&gt;trickster&lt;/a&gt;, is an important being that often has inappropriate behavior (such as marrying his own daughter, etc.) in which he overturns social convention. The Navajo, Western Apache, Jicarilla, and Lipan have an emergence or Creation Story, while this is lacking in the Chiricahua and Mescalero.\nMost Southern Athabascan gods are personified natural forces that run through the universe. They may be used for human purposes through ritual ceremonies. The following is a formulation by the &lt;a href=\"anthropologist\"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Basso\"&gt;Keith Basso&lt;/a&gt; of the Western Apache's concept of \"diy\u00ed\"':\nThe term \"diy\u00ed\"' refers to one or all of a set of abstract and invisible forces which are said to derive from certain classes of animals, plants, minerals, meteorological phenomena, and mythological figures within the Western Apache universe. Any of the various powers may be acquired by man and, if properly handled, used for a variety of purposes.\n&lt;a href=\"Medicine%20men\"&gt;Medicine men&lt;/a&gt; learn the ceremonies, which can also be acquired by direct revelation to the individual. Different Apache cultures had different views of ceremonial practice. Most Chiricahua and Mescalero ceremonies were learned through the transmission of personal religious visions, while the Jicarilla and Western Apache used standardized rituals as the more central ceremonial practice. Important standardized ceremonies include the puberty ceremony (Sunrise Dance) of young women, Navajo chants, Jicarilla \"long-life\" ceremonies, and Plains Apache \"&lt;a href=\"sacred\"&gt;sacred&lt;/a&gt;-bundle\" ceremonies.\nCertain animals - owls, snakes, bears, and coyotes - are considered spiritually evil and prone to cause sickness to humans. .\nMany Apache ceremonies use masked representations of religious spirits. &lt;a href=\"Sandpainting\"&gt;Sandpainting&lt;/a&gt; is an important ceremony in the Navajo, Western Apache, and Jicarilla traditions, in which healers create temporary, sacred art from colored sands. Anthropologists believe the use of masks and sandpainting are examples of &lt;a href=\"cultural%20diffusion\"&gt;cultural diffusion&lt;/a&gt; from neighboring &lt;a href=\"Pueblo\"&gt;Pueblo&lt;/a&gt; cultures.\nThe Apaches participate in many religious dances, including the rain dance, dances for the crop and harvest, and a spirit dance. These dances were mostly for influencing the weather and enriching their food resources.\nLanguages.\nThe five Apache languages are &lt;a href=\"Apachean%20languages\"&gt;Apachean languages&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn belong to the &lt;a href=\"Athabaskan%20languages\"&gt;Athabaskan&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"Na-Dene%20languages\"&gt;Eyak-Athabaskan language family&lt;/a&gt;. All Apache languages are &lt;a href=\"endangered%20language\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt;. Lipan is reported &lt;a href=\"extinct%20language\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Southern Athabascan branch was defined by &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Hoijer\"&gt;Harry Hoijer&lt;/a&gt; primarily according to its &lt;a href=\"Sound%20change\"&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Word%20stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt;-initial &lt;a href=\"consonant\"&gt;consonant&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Proto-language\"&gt;Proto&lt;/a&gt;-Athabascan series ' and ' into ' (in addition to the widespread merger of ' and ' into ' also found in many &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Athabascan\"&gt;Northern Athabascan&lt;/a&gt; languages).\nHoijer (1938) divided the Apache sub-family into an eastern branch consisting of Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains Apache and a Western branch consisting of Navajo, Western Apache (San Carlos), Chiricahua, and Mescalero based on the merger of Proto-Apachean ' and ' to \"k\" in the Eastern branch. Thus, as can be seen in the example below, when the Western languages have noun or verb stems that start with \"t\", the related forms in the Eastern languages will start with a \"k\":\nHe later revised his proposal in 1971 when he found that Plains Apache did not participate in the \"\" merger to consider Plains Apache as a language equidistant from the other languages, now called Southwestern Apachean. Thus, some stems that originally started with \"*k\u032f\" in Proto-Athabascan start with \"ch\" in Plains Apache while the other languages start with \"ts\".\nMorris Opler (1975) has noted cultural similarities of Jicarilla and Lipan with Eastern Apache language speakers and differences from Western Apache speakers, supporting Hojier's initial classification. Other linguists, particularly &lt;a href=\"Michael%20E.%20Krauss\"&gt;Michael Krauss&lt;/a&gt; (1973), have noted that a classification based only on the initial consonants of noun and verb stems is arbitrary and when other &lt;a href=\"sound%20correspondence\"&gt;sound correspondence&lt;/a&gt;s are considered the relationships between the languages appear more complex.\nApache languages are &lt;a href=\"tonal%20language\"&gt;tonal&lt;/a&gt;. Regarding tonal development, all Apache languages are \"low-marked\", which means that stems with a \"constricted\" &lt;a href=\"syllable%20rime\"&gt;syllable rime&lt;/a&gt; in the proto-language developed low tone while all other rimes developed high tone. Other Northern Athabascan languages are \"high-marked\": their tonal development is the reverse. In the example below, if low-marked Navajo and Chiricahua have a low tone, then the high-marked Northern Athabascan languages, &lt;a href=\"Slavey%20language\"&gt;Slavey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chilcotin%20language\"&gt;Chilcotin&lt;/a&gt;, have a high tone, and if Navajo and Chiricahua have a high tone, then Slavey and Chilcotin have a low tone.\nNotable historic Apache.\nContemporary Apache people are listed under their specific tribes."
