    "text": "Louis Moilliet (October 6, 1880 \u2013 August 24, 1962) was an artist from &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; who was noted as a &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;painter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; designer. He was lifelong friends with fellow artists &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Klee\"&gt;Paul Klee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"August%20Macke\"&gt;August Macke&lt;/a&gt;, spending time painting and traveling with them in &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; 1914 and introducing Klee into the group &lt;a href=\"Der%20Blaue%20Reiter\"&gt;Der Blaue Reiter&lt;/a&gt; (The Blue Rider) earlier in 1911. His expressionist painting style was closely connected with that of the &lt;a href=\"Orphism%20%28art%29\"&gt;Orphism&lt;/a&gt; movement. One of his more popular works is titled \"In The Circus\"."
