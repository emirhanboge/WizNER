    "text": "Knapp Lake is a small natural &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; located in western &lt;a href=\"Noble%20County%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Noble County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnapp Lake is directly attached to Little Bause Lake via a &lt;a href=\"channel%20%28geography%29\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt; and Little Knapp Lake on the south and southwest and Moss Lake to the north. Little Bause has development around its shores while Little Knapp is undeveloped. &lt;a href=\"Harper%20Lake%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;Harper Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Lake\"&gt;Gilbert Lake&lt;/a&gt;, both undeveloped for the most part form the southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Papakeechie%20watershed\"&gt;Papakeechie watershed&lt;/a&gt; as it flows northward to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wawasee\"&gt;Lake Wawasee&lt;/a&gt; through Moss Lake.\nThe southwest, northeast and north shores comprise the bulk of the homes on the lake. The north shore has five man-made channels. The northwest shore is forested. &lt;a href=\"Arable%20land\"&gt;Farmland&lt;/a&gt; surrounds mostly the east and south beyond inhabited areas.\nIn 1999, with the assistance of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Wawasee Property Owners Association purchased of land and &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;s on Knapp Lake and surrounding Little Knapp Lake."
