From that point forward, the river is referred to as the Katsura River, and its flow continues for several kilometers through &lt;a href=\"Kyoto%20Prefecture\"&gt;Kyoto Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; until it joins the &lt;a href=\"Kamo%20River\"&gt;Kamo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uji%20River\"&gt;Uji&lt;/a&gt; rivers.\nThe Katsura River area features some of the oldest shrines in Kyoto and Japan, such as &lt;a href=\"Matsuo%20Shrine\"&gt;Matsuo Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, and, as a counterpoint to the channelled &lt;a href=\"Kamo%20River\"&gt;Kamo River&lt;/a&gt;, supports acres of &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; area on its flood plain. It also is known for its summer supply of \"&lt;a href=\"ayu\"&gt;ayu&lt;/a&gt;\" and is a popular place for holding &lt;a href=\"barbecue\"&gt;barbecue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExternal links.\n (confluence with Kizu River and Uji River)"
