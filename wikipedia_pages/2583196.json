As DG &lt;a href=\"Inter-Services%20Intelligence\"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt;, General Akhtar collaborated with the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; and masterminded the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Cyclone\"&gt;resistance network&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20Mujahideen\"&gt;Afghan Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, eventually managing to force the Soviets out of &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his close friendship with &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;President of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"General%20Zia-ul-Haq\"&gt;General Zia-ul-Haq&lt;/a&gt;, General Akhtar was widely considered to be the second most powerful man in the country during &lt;a href=\"Zia%20ul-Haq\"&gt;General Zia's&lt;/a&gt; eleven-year military &lt;a href=\"dictatorship\"&gt;dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20state%20funeral%20of%20Muhammad%20Zia-ul-Haq\"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; in the plane crash which also killed &lt;a href=\"Zia%20ul-Haq\"&gt;General Zia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"US%20Ambassador%20to%20Pakistan\"&gt;US Ambassador to Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Lewis%20Raphel\"&gt;Arnold Lewis Raphel&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, his sons &lt;a href=\"Humayun%20Akhtar%20Khan\"&gt;Humayun Akhtar Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haroon%20Akhtar%20Khan\"&gt;Haroon Akhtar Khan&lt;/a&gt; joined politics and have been elected as &lt;a href=\"Members%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and headed key ministerial portfolios several times.\nEducation.\nAkhtar Abdur Rahman Khan was born on 11 June 1924 in &lt;a href=\"Peshawar%2C%20North-West%20Frontier\"&gt;Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province&lt;/a&gt;. into a &lt;a href=\"Kakazai\"&gt;Kakazai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pashtuns\"&gt;Pashtun&lt;/a&gt; family. Akhtar's father, Dr Abdul Rahman Khan was a doctor in a government hospital in Peshawar, &lt;a href=\"North-West%20Frontier%20Province\"&gt;North-West Frontier Province&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa\"&gt;Khyber Pakhtunkhwa&lt;/a&gt;). He lost his father at the tender age of four and was raised by his mother, after the family moved to East Punjab in British India. He enrolled in &lt;a href=\"Government%20College%20University%20%28Faisalabad%29\"&gt;Government College University (Faisalabad)&lt;/a&gt; in 1941, subsequently earning a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;Bachelor of Science&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Statistics\"&gt;Statistics&lt;/a&gt; in 1945 followed by a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Science\"&gt;Master of Science&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt; in 1947.\nMilitary career.\nRising through the ranks.\nGeneral Akhtar Abdur Rahman joined the &lt;a href=\"British%20Indian%20Army\"&gt;British Indian Army&lt;/a&gt; in 1946, before becoming &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28OF-2%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Army\"&gt;Pakistan Army&lt;/a&gt; in 1949. After witnessing the traumatic events during the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20India\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt;, Akhtar was appointed as an instructor at the Artillery School in &lt;a href=\"Nowshera%2C%20Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa\"&gt;Nowshera&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he was selected for an infantry training course with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; and was sent on deputation to complete a course in the United Kingdom. Upon returning to Pakistan, he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Major\"&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; and posted as a &lt;a href=\"military%20adviser\"&gt;military adviser&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan%20Rifles\"&gt;East-Pakistan Army&lt;/a&gt; from April 1954 to October 1954. He was later transferred back to &lt;a href=\"General%20Headquarters%20%28Pakistan%20Army%29\"&gt;General combatant headquarters&lt;/a&gt; (GHQ) as a &lt;a href=\"staff%20officer\"&gt;staff officer&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held from April 1956 to February 1957. He actively participated in the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201965\"&gt;Indo-Pakistani War of 1965&lt;/a&gt; and was appointed at &lt;a href=\"IV%20Corps%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;IV Corps&lt;/a&gt; as an operational field officer. In the 1965 war he gallantly defended the Lahore sector and that led to his promotion to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant-colonel\"&gt;lieutenant-colonel&lt;/a&gt; and he remained &lt;a href=\"second-in-command\"&gt;second-in-command&lt;/a&gt; of the infantry regiment in Lahore. After the war, he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Colonel\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; while being stationed with the IV Corps. Later, he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Brigadier\"&gt;Brigadier&lt;/a&gt; and transferred to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Pakistan\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; parts of the country where he commanded an infantry brigade in &lt;a href=\"Azad%20Kashmir\"&gt;Azad Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1971, he was promoted to the Two-Star General rank of &lt;a href=\"Major-General\"&gt;Major-General&lt;/a&gt; and served as &lt;a href=\"General%20Officer%20Commanding\"&gt;General Officer Commanding&lt;/a&gt; (GOC) of the &lt;a href=\"12th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;12th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; stationed in &lt;a href=\"Murree\"&gt;Murree&lt;/a&gt;. as GOC of the 12th Infantry Division, General Akhtar was considered very close to Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Zulfiqar%20Ali%20Bhutto\"&gt;Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; and personally received Bhutto whenever he visited the command office of the 12th Division. He did not take part in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Fair%20Play\"&gt;1977 military coup&lt;/a&gt; and privately opposed the martial law to remove &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto\"&gt;Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;. Six months after the military coup of 1977 he was appointed as &lt;a href=\"adjutant%20general\"&gt;adjutant general&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"General%20Headquarters%20%28Pakistan%20Army%29\"&gt;General Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; for the next two years. During this time, General Akhtar became aware of a conspiracy in which Lieutenant-General Faiz Ali Chishti of &lt;a href=\"X%20Corps%20%28Pakistan%29\"&gt;X Corps&lt;/a&gt;, a close associate of General Zia-ul-Haq, secretly became rebellious and conspired to stage a military coup in the country. As early as of 1979, Akhtar received a call from General Chishti and met him at his office in &lt;a href=\"Chaklala%20Cantonment\"&gt;Chaklala Military District&lt;/a&gt; (CMD). At this meeting, General Chishti informed him of the conspiracy that aimed to topple General Zia-ul-Haq and sought his assistance. According to the &lt;a href=\"The%20News%20International\"&gt;News International&lt;/a&gt;'s intelligence unit, Chishti was under the impression that since Rahman had not been promoted, he would accept this invitation; especially when he was promised that after the coup worked out successfully, he would not only be promoted but would also become one of the pillars of the new regime. After returning to the GHQ, General Akhtar contacted General &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Zia-ul-Haq\"&gt;Zia-ul-Haq&lt;/a&gt; and foiled the plot against Zia. In June 1979 after the counter-coup had been foiled, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; General Zia-ul-Haq awarded General Akhtar a promotion to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General\"&gt;Lieutenant General&lt;/a&gt; and appointed him Director General of the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Services%20Intelligence\"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoviet\u2013Afghan War.\nWhen the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army in Afghanistan, Pakistan's top military brass led by General Akhtar believed that &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; would be the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;'s next target. They felt that because of Pakistan's strategic location and given the fact that it has warm water ports in the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Sea\"&gt;Arabian Sea&lt;/a&gt;, it was a prime target for future invasion. Considering the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; threatened Pakistan's national security, Pakistan's premier intelligence agency the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Services%20Intelligence\"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt; headed by General Akhtar started providing financial, military, and strategic assistance to the Afghan mujahideen. The &lt;a href=\"Inter-Services%20Intelligence\"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt; received billions of dollars in military assistance from the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; to train and command the Afghan rebels in a bid to defeat the Soviets. This covert operation was known as &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Cyclone\"&gt;Operation Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;, and was executed with the CIA providing the money and weapons, the ISI training and commanding the Afghan Mujahideen groups, and the Mujahideen conducting &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately leading to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. During this time, General Akhtar developed a highly effective working relationship with key figures in the United States including &lt;a href=\"CIA%20Director\"&gt;CIA Director&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20Casey\"&gt;William Casey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Congressman\"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Wilson%20%28Texas%20politician%29\"&gt;Charlie Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his tenure as DG ISI, General Akhtar's influence on Pakistan's &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction\"&gt;atomic weapons program&lt;/a&gt; grew and he worked tirelessly to collect around him colleagues who were equally dynamic and determined to make the ISI an organisation that would influence the domestic and external policies of the country and it was under him that the ISI became recognized one of the most powerful spy agencies in the world. In 1987, at the pinnacle of his career after having achieved remarkable success as in the Afghan war and protecting Pakistan's Nuclear Program, General Akhtar was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"four-star%20rank\"&gt;four-star rank&lt;/a&gt; and appointed &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee%2C%20Pakistan\"&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee&lt;/a&gt;, the highest ranking four-star assignment in the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Pakistan Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nOn 17 August 1988, General Akhtar died in a plane crash along with several other high-profile casualties including &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;President of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"General%20Zia-ul-Haq\"&gt;General Zia-ul-Haq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"US%20Ambassador%20to%20Pakistan\"&gt;US Ambassador to Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Lewis%20Raphel\"&gt;Arnold Lewis Raphel&lt;/a&gt;. General Akhtar had accompanied General Zia to &lt;a href=\"Bahawalpur\"&gt;Bahawalpur&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"C-130B%20Hercules\"&gt;C-130B Hercules&lt;/a&gt; Presidential aircraft to witness a &lt;a href=\"M1%20Abrams\"&gt;US M1 Abrams&lt;/a&gt; tank demonstration. After the Generals witnessed the demonstration, the aircraft departed from Bahawalpur Airport and was expected to reach Islamabad International Airport.[110] Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air claimed it was flying erratically and then nosedived and exploded on impact, killing all 31 passengers on board. Shortly after the plane crash, the Senate chairman &lt;a href=\"Ghulam%20Ishaq%20Khan\"&gt;Ghulam Ishaq Khan&lt;/a&gt; became President and announced Zia's death on radio and TV. [113] There is speculation that various state intelligence agencies including the Soviet &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt;, Indian &lt;a href=\"Research%20and%20Analysis%20Wing\"&gt;RAW&lt;/a&gt;, Israeli &lt;a href=\"MOSSAD\"&gt;MOSSAD&lt;/a&gt;, and Afghan &lt;a href=\"KHAD\"&gt;KHAD&lt;/a&gt; (in retaliation for Pakistani support of the mujahideen in Afghanistan) or an alliance of the four countries intelligence agencies along with dissident groups within the Pakistan Army were involved in the incident.\nShortly after the crash, a board of inquiry was set up to investigate it. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given.[116] There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed. To this day, the cause of the plane crash remains a mystery and has given rise to many conspiracy theories."
