The party's main values are &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Family%20values\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe party was formed in 2019 by renowned layer and &lt;a href=\"Coali%C8%9Bia%20pentru%20Familie\"&gt;Coali\u021bia pentru Familie&lt;/a&gt; figure, Peter Costea, and his supporters after he failed to enter the &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament\"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20politician\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Romania\"&gt;elections held earlier that year&lt;/a&gt;.

The law is deemed by him as being illegitimate as it was issued in 1989 by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20National%20Salvation%20Front%20Council\"&gt;National Salvation Front Council&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Revolution\"&gt;anti-communist revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The party also opposes &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Anti-gender%20movement\"&gt;gender ideology&lt;/a&gt;, or any form of &lt;a href=\"sex%20education\"&gt;sex education&lt;/a&gt; for children in schools.
