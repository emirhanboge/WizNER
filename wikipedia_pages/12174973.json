    "text": "Transandinomys talamancae is a &lt;a href=\"rodent\"&gt;rodent&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cricetidae\"&gt;Cricetidae&lt;/a&gt; that occurs from &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; to southwestern &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. Its habitat consists of lowland forests up to above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. With a body &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; of , it is a medium-sized &lt;a href=\"Oryzomyini\"&gt;rice rat&lt;/a&gt;. The fur is soft and is reddish to brownish on the upperparts and white to &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Abuff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"underparts\"&gt;underparts&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"tail\"&gt;tail&lt;/a&gt; is dark brown above and lighter below and the ears and feet are long. The &lt;a href=\"whiskers\"&gt;vibrissae&lt;/a&gt; (whiskers) are very long. In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long and the &lt;a href=\"braincase\"&gt;braincase&lt;/a&gt; is low. The number of &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s varies from 34 to 54.\nThe species was first described in 1891 by &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Asaph%20Allen\"&gt;Joel Asaph Allen&lt;/a&gt; and thereafter a variety of names, now considered &lt;a href=\"synonym%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt;, were applied to local populations. It was &lt;a href=\"Lumpers%20and%20splitters\"&gt;lumped&lt;/a&gt; into a widespread species \"Oryzomys capito\" (now \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys%20megacephalus\"&gt;Hylaeamys megacephalus&lt;/a&gt;\") from the 1960s until the 1980s and the current allocation of synonyms dates from 1998. It was placed in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Oryzomys\"&gt;Oryzomys&lt;/a&gt;\" until 2006, as \"Oryzomys talamancae\", but is not closely related to the &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt; of that genus and was therefore moved to a separate genus \"Transandinomys\" in 2006. It shares this genus with \"&lt;a href=\"Transandinomys%20bolivaris\"&gt;Transandinomys bolivaris&lt;/a&gt;\", which has even longer vibrissae; the two overlap broadly in distribution and are &lt;a href=\"morphology%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;morphologically&lt;/a&gt; similar.\nActive during the night, \"Transandinomys talamancae\" lives on the ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger &lt;a href=\"home%20range\"&gt;home range&lt;/a&gt;s than most females. It breeds throughout the year, although few individuals survive for more than a year. After a &lt;a href=\"gestation\"&gt;gestation&lt;/a&gt; period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach &lt;a href=\"sexual%20maturity\"&gt;sexual maturity&lt;/a&gt; within two months. A variety of &lt;a href=\"parasite\"&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt;s occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1891, &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Asaph%20Allen\"&gt;Joel Asaph Allen&lt;/a&gt; was the first to scientifically describe \"Transandinomys talamancae\", when he named \"Oryzomys talamancae\" from a specimen from Talamanca, Costa Rica. He placed it in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Oryzomys\"&gt;Oryzomys&lt;/a&gt;\", then more broadly defined than it is now, and compared it to both the &lt;a href=\"marsh%20rice%20rat\"&gt;marsh rice rat&lt;/a&gt; (\"O.\u00a0palustris\") and to \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys%20laticeps\"&gt;O.\u00a0laticeps&lt;/a&gt;\". Several other names that are now recognized as &lt;a href=\"synonym%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt; of \"Transandinomys talamancae\" were introduced in the following years. In 1899, Allen described \"Oryzomys mollipilosus\", \"O.\u00a0magdalenae\", and \"O.\u00a0villosus\" from &lt;a href=\"Magdalena%20Department\"&gt;Magdalena Department&lt;/a&gt;, Colombia. &lt;a href=\"Oldfield%20Thomas\"&gt;Oldfield Thomas&lt;/a&gt; added \"O.\u00a0sylvaticus\" from &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Rosa%2C%20El%20Oro\"&gt;Santa Rosa&lt;/a&gt;, Ecuador in 1900 and \"O.\u00a0panamensis\" from &lt;a href=\"Panama%20City\"&gt;Panama City&lt;/a&gt;, Panama, in 1901. In the same year, Wirt Robinson and Markus Lyon named \"Oryzomys medius\" from near &lt;a href=\"La%20Guaira\"&gt;La Guaira&lt;/a&gt;, Venezuela. Allen added \"O.\u00a0carrikeri\" from Talamanca, Costa Rica, in 1908.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20Alphonso%20Goldman\"&gt;Edward Alphonso Goldman&lt;/a&gt; revised North American \"Oryzomys\" in 1918. He placed both \"panamensis\" and \"carrikeri\" as synonyms of \"Oryzomys talamancae\" and mentioned \"O.\u00a0mollipilosus\" and \"O.\u00a0medius\" as closely related species. \"O.\u00a0talamancae\" was the only member of its own species group, which Goldman regarded as closest to \"Oryzomys bombycinus\" (=\"&lt;a href=\"Transandinomys%20bolivaris\"&gt;Transandinomys bolivaris&lt;/a&gt;\"). In 1960, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Hershkovitz\"&gt;Philip Hershkovitz&lt;/a&gt; listed \"talamancae\", \"medius\", \"magdalenae\", \"sylvaticus\", and \"mollipilosus\" among the many synonyms of \"\"Oryzomys laticeps\", a name later replaced by \"Oryzomys capito\"\". The species remained lumped under \"Oryzomys capito\" until 1983, when &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Gardner\"&gt;Alfred Gardner&lt;/a&gt; again listed it as a valid species, an action more fully documented by &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Musser\"&gt;Guy Musser&lt;/a&gt; and Marina Williams in 1985. Musser and Williams also found that the &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; of \"Oryzomys villosus\", the affinities of which had been disputed, in fact consisted of a skin of \"O.\u00a0talamancae\" and a skull of the \"Oryzomys albigularis\" group (equivalent to the current genus \"&lt;a href=\"Nephelomys\"&gt;Nephelomys&lt;/a&gt;\"). They restricted the name to the skin, making \"villosus\" a synonym of \"O.\u00a0talamancae\". They also examined the holotypes of \"panamensis\", \"carrikeri\", \"mollipilosus\", \"medius\", and \"magdalenae\" and identified them as examples of \"Oryzomys talamancae\". Additionally, they included \"sylvaticus\" and \"Oryzomys castaneus\" J.A. Allen, 1901, from Ecuador as synonyms, but without examining the holotypes. Musser and colleagues reviewed the group again in 1998 and confirmed that \"sylvaticus\" represents \"Oryzomys talamancae\"; however, they found that \"castaneus\" was in fact an example of \"Oryzomys bolivaris\" (the current \"Transandinomys bolivaris\").\nIn 2006, Marcelo Weksler published a &lt;a href=\"phylogenetics\"&gt;phylogenetic&lt;/a&gt; analysis of &lt;a href=\"Oryzomyini\"&gt;Oryzomyini&lt;/a&gt; (\"rice rats\"), the &lt;a href=\"tribe%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; to which \"Oryzomys\" is allocated, using &lt;a href=\"morphology%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;morphological&lt;/a&gt; data and &lt;a href=\"DNA%20sequence\"&gt;DNA sequence&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"RBP3\"&gt;IRBP&lt;/a&gt; gene. His results showed species of \"Oryzomys\" dispersed across Oryzomyini and suggested that most species in the genus should be allocated to new genera. \"Oryzomys talamancae\" was also included; it appeared within \"&lt;a href=\"Oryzomyini%23clade%20B\"&gt;clade B&lt;/a&gt;\", together with other species formerly associated with \"Oryzomys capito\". Some analyses placed it closest to species now placed in \"&lt;a href=\"Euryoryzomys\"&gt;Euryoryzomys&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Nephelomys\"&gt;Nephelomys&lt;/a&gt;\", but with low support. Later in the same year, he, together with Alexandre Percequillo and Robert Voss, named ten new genera for species previously placed in \"Oryzomys\", including \"&lt;a href=\"Transandinomys\"&gt;Transandinomys&lt;/a&gt;\", which has \"Oryzomys talamancae\" (now \"Transandinomys talamancae\") as its &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt;. They also included \"Oryzomys bolivaris\", which was not included in Weksler's phylogenetic study, in this new genus. The two species are morphologically similar, but Weksler and colleagues could identify only one &lt;a href=\"synapomorphy\"&gt;synapomorphy&lt;/a&gt; (shared-derived trait) for them: very long &lt;a href=\"superciliary%20vibrissa\"&gt;superciliary vibrissa&lt;/a&gt;e (&lt;a href=\"vibrissa\"&gt;vibrissa&lt;/a&gt;e, or whiskers, above the eyes). \"Transandinomys\" is one of about 30 genera in Oryzomyini, a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily &lt;a href=\"Sigmodontinae\"&gt;Sigmodontinae&lt;/a&gt; of family &lt;a href=\"Cricetidae\"&gt;Cricetidae&lt;/a&gt;, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"common%20name\"&gt;common name&lt;/a&gt;s have been proposed for \"Transandinomys talamancae\", including \"Talamanca Rice Rat\", \"Transandean Oryzomys\", and \"Talamancan Rice Rat\".\nDescription.\n\"Transandinomys talamancae\" is a medium-sized, brightly colored rice rat. It is similar to \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" and the two are often confused. They are about as large, but in \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter. Both species share uniquely long vibrissae, with both the mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae extending to or beyond the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but those in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" are substantially longer. \"&lt;a href=\"Handleyomys%20alfaroi\"&gt;H.\u00a0alfaroi&lt;/a&gt;\", a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador, is also similar. It is smaller and darker, but young adult \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" are similar in color to adult \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\" and often misidentified. \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys%20megacephalus\"&gt;Hylaeamys megacephalus&lt;/a&gt;\", with which \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" was synonymized for some decades, is similar in body size, but is not known to overlap with \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" in range.\nThe fur is short, dense and soft in \"Transandinomys talamancae\"; in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\", it is longer and even more soft and dense. The color of the upperparts varies from reddish to brownish, becoming lighter towards the sides and the cheeks. The underparts are white to &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Abuff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;, with the bases of the hairs &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aplumbeous\"&gt;plumbeous&lt;/a&gt; (lead-colored). The fur of \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" is darker: dark brown above and dark gray below. \"H.\u00a0megacephalus\" also has darker fur. Juveniles have thin, gray fur, which is &lt;a href=\"molt\"&gt;molt&lt;/a&gt;ed into the dark brown subadult fur when the animal is about 35 to 40\u00a0days old. This fur is replaced by the bright adult fur at age 49 to 56\u00a0days. Juveniles are never blackish as in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". The ears are dark brown, large, and densely covered with very small hairs.\nThe sparsely haired tail is approximately as long as the head and body. It is dark brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of \"H.\u00a0megacephalus\" has little to no difference in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of \"Transandinomys\" (bicolored in \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" and unicolored in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\"), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.\nThe hindfeet are long and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". The digits of the hindfeet are surrounded by &lt;a href=\"ungual%20tufts\"&gt;ungual tufts&lt;/a&gt; of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (&lt;a href=\"squamae\"&gt;squamae&lt;/a&gt;), which are usually entirely absent in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". The &lt;a href=\"Paw%23Common%20characteristics\"&gt;pads&lt;/a&gt; are moderately large.\nThe length of the head and body is , tail length , hindfoot length , ear length , and body mass . As in most oryzomyines, females have eight &lt;a href=\"mammae\"&gt;mammae&lt;/a&gt;. There are 12 &lt;a href=\"thoracic%20vertebra\"&gt;thoracic vertebra&lt;/a&gt; with associated ribs, 7 &lt;a href=\"lumbar%20vertebra\"&gt;lumbars&lt;/a&gt;, and 29 &lt;a href=\"caudal%20vertebra\"&gt;caudals&lt;/a&gt;; a pair of supernumerary (additional) ribs is occasionally present.\nSkull and teeth.\nThe skull has a long rostrum (front part), a broad &lt;a href=\"interorbital%20region\"&gt;interorbital region&lt;/a&gt; (between the eyes), and a low &lt;a href=\"braincase\"&gt;braincase&lt;/a&gt;. It differs from that of \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" in various proportions, which are more apparent in adults than in juveniles; the skull of \"H.\u00a0megacephalus\" is distinctly larger. The &lt;a href=\"zygomatic%20plate\"&gt;zygomatic plate&lt;/a&gt; is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper &lt;a href=\"molar%20%28tooth%29\"&gt;molar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"zygomatic%20arch\"&gt;zygomatic arch&lt;/a&gt; (cheekbone) is heavy. The &lt;a href=\"nasal%20bone\"&gt;nasal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"premaxillary\"&gt;premaxillary&lt;/a&gt; bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" is similar, but has stronger beading and \"H.\u00a0megacephalus\" entirely lacks the beading. The &lt;a href=\"parietal%20bone\"&gt;parietal bone&lt;/a&gt; is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". The &lt;a href=\"interparietal%20bone\"&gt;interparietal bone&lt;/a&gt;, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.\nThe &lt;a href=\"incisive%20foramina\"&gt;incisive foramina&lt;/a&gt; (openings in the front part of the &lt;a href=\"palate\"&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\". The bony palate is long and extends beyond the end of the molar row and the back margin of the &lt;a href=\"maxilla\"&gt;maxilla&lt;/a&gt;ry bones. The &lt;a href=\"posterolateral%20palatal%20pits\"&gt;posterolateral palatal pits&lt;/a&gt;, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and may or may not be recessed into a &lt;a href=\"fossa%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;fossa&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"sphenopalatine%20vacuities\"&gt;sphenopalatine vacuities&lt;/a&gt; (openings in the roof of the &lt;a href=\"mesopterygoid%20fossa\"&gt;mesopterygoid fossa&lt;/a&gt;, behind the palate) are also small, as are the &lt;a href=\"auditory%20bulla\"&gt;auditory bulla&lt;/a&gt;e. As in most oryzomyines, the &lt;a href=\"subsquamosal%20fenestra\"&gt;subsquamosal fenestra&lt;/a&gt;, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and &lt;a href=\"foramen\"&gt;foramina&lt;/a&gt; (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys\"&gt;Hylaeamys&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"mandible\"&gt;mandible&lt;/a&gt; (lower jaw) is less robust than in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". The &lt;a href=\"coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible\"&gt;coronoid process&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"process%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; in the back part of the bone) is small and the &lt;a href=\"capsular%20process\"&gt;capsular process&lt;/a&gt;, which houses the root of the lower &lt;a href=\"incisor\"&gt;incisor&lt;/a&gt;, are small. The &lt;a href=\"mental%20foramen\"&gt;mental foramen&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"diastema%20%28dentistry%29\"&gt;diastema&lt;/a&gt; between the lower &lt;a href=\"incisor\"&gt;incisor&lt;/a&gt; and the first molar, opens towards the side, as usual in oryzomyines. The upper and lower &lt;a href=\"masseteric%20ridge\"&gt;masseteric ridge&lt;/a&gt;s, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar.\nThe upper incisor is &lt;a href=\"opisthodont\"&gt;opisthodont&lt;/a&gt;, with the cutting edge oriented backward. As usual in oryzomyines, the molars are &lt;a href=\"brachydont\"&gt;brachydont&lt;/a&gt; (low-crowned) and &lt;a href=\"bunodont\"&gt;bunodont&lt;/a&gt; (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). The first upper molar is narrower than in \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\". In this species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\" and \"E.\u00a0nitidus\", the &lt;a href=\"mesoflexus\"&gt;mesoflexus&lt;/a&gt; on the second upper molar, which separates the &lt;a href=\"paracone\"&gt;paracone&lt;/a&gt; (one of the main cusps) from the &lt;a href=\"mesoloph\"&gt;mesoloph&lt;/a&gt; (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The &lt;a href=\"hypoflexid\"&gt;hypoflexid&lt;/a&gt; on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, the species is again similar to \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" but unlike \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\". Each of the upper molars has three roots (two at the labial, or outer, side and one at the lingual, or inner, side) and each of the lower molars has two (one at the front and one at the back); \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" lacks the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines, including species of \"Euryoryzomys\", \"Nephelomys\", and \"Handleyomys\".\nMale reproductive anatomy.\nAs is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, \"Transandinomys talamancae\" has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the &lt;a href=\"baculum\"&gt;baculum&lt;/a&gt; (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit is larger than the two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly &lt;a href=\"penile%20spines\"&gt;covered by small spines&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.\nSome features of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In \"Transandinomys talamancae\", a single pair of &lt;a href=\"preputial%20gland\"&gt;preputial gland&lt;/a&gt;s is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of &lt;a href=\"ventral\"&gt;ventral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prostate\"&gt;prostate&lt;/a&gt; glands and a single pair of &lt;a href=\"anterior\"&gt;anterior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dorsal%20%28location%29\"&gt;dorsal&lt;/a&gt; prostate glands. Part of the end of the &lt;a href=\"vesicular%20gland\"&gt;vesicular gland&lt;/a&gt; is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.\nKaryotype.\nThe &lt;a href=\"karyotype\"&gt;karyotype&lt;/a&gt; in \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" is variable. Samples from two different localities in Venezuela have 34\u00a0&lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"karyotype%23Fundamental%20number\"&gt;fundamental number&lt;/a&gt; of 64 chromosomal arms (2n\u00a0=\u00a034, FN\u00a0=\u00a064). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The &lt;a href=\"autosome\"&gt;autosome&lt;/a&gt;s (non-&lt;a href=\"sex%20chromosome\"&gt;sex chromosome&lt;/a&gt;s) of the 2n\u00a0=\u00a034 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n\u00a0=\u00a040\u201342 karyotypes include several &lt;a href=\"acrocentric\"&gt;acrocentric&lt;/a&gt; autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n\u00a0=\u00a034 karyotype includes two large &lt;a href=\"submetacentric\"&gt;submetacentric&lt;/a&gt; pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of &lt;a href=\"subtelocentric\"&gt;subtelocentric&lt;/a&gt; chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n\u00a0=\u00a040\u201342 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both &lt;a href=\"Robertsonian%20translocation\"&gt;Robertsonian translocation&lt;/a&gt;s (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and &lt;a href=\"pericentric%20inversion\"&gt;pericentric inversion&lt;/a&gt;s (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the &lt;a href=\"centromere\"&gt;centromere&lt;/a&gt;) are needed to explain the difference between the two groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n\u00a0=\u00a040\u201342 sample was from within a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20zone\"&gt;hybrid zone&lt;/a&gt; between two karyotypic morphs.\nThe karyotype of an Ecuadorean sample from north of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Guayaquil\"&gt;Gulf of Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of Venezuelan animals at 2n\u00a0=\u00a036, FN\u00a0=\u00a060; it includes four acrocentric and two subtelocentric pairs and no submetacentrics. In contrast, a sample from south of the Gulf had 2n\u00a0=\u00a054, FN\u00a0=\u00a060, including 23 pairs of acrocentrics and four pairs of &lt;a href=\"Centromere%23Metacentric\"&gt;metacentrics&lt;/a&gt; (with two equally long arms). Musser and colleagues termed the difference between the two Ecuadorian forms \"impressive\" and noted that further research was needed to understand the karyotypic differentiation within the species more fully. Both \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" and \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\" have more chromosomes and arms, at 2n\u00a0=\u00a058, FN\u00a0=\u00a080 and 2n\u00a0=\u00a060\u201362, FN\u00a0=\u00a0100\u2013104 respectively. \"Hylaeamys megacephalus\" has 2n\u00a0=\u00a054, FN\u00a0=\u00a058\u201362 and the similar \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys%20perenensis\"&gt;Hylaeamys perenensis&lt;/a&gt;\" has 2n\u00a0=\u00a052, FN\u00a0=\u00a062; these karyotypes resemble that of southern Ecuadorean \"T.\u00a0talamancae\".\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe distribution of \"Transandinomys talamancae\" extends from northwestern Costa Rica south and east to northern Venezuela and southwestern Ecuador, up to above sea level. It is a forest species and occurs in both &lt;a href=\"evergreen%20forest\"&gt;evergreen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deciduous%20forest\"&gt;deciduous forest&lt;/a&gt;. Although its distribution broadly overlaps that of \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\", it is more widely distributed in South America because of its greater tolerance of dry forest habitats.\n\"Transandinomys talamancae\" reaches the northern limit of its range in Costa Rica, but except for one record from the far northwest (in &lt;a href=\"Guanacaste%20Province\"&gt;Guanacaste Province&lt;/a&gt; near the southern margin of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Nicaragua\"&gt;Lake Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;), it is known only from the southeastern third of the country. In contrast, \"T.\u00a0bolivaris\" and \"H.\u00a0alfaroi\" occur further north, into Honduras and Mexico respectively. It occurs throughout Panama at low elevations. Along the Pacific coast in Colombia and Ecuador, it is found on the coastal plain and the adjacent foothills of the Andes. The southernmost known record is in far southwestern Ecuador, but the species may range into nearby Peru.\nIt also occurs throughout northern Colombia at low elevations and into western Venezuela west of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Maracaibo\"&gt;Lake Maracaibo&lt;/a&gt; and at the foot of the western part of the &lt;a href=\"Venezuelan%20Coastal%20Range\"&gt;Venezuelan Coastal Range&lt;/a&gt; east to &lt;a href=\"Guatopo%20National%20Park\"&gt;Guatopo National Park&lt;/a&gt;. \"Hylaeamys megacephalus\" occurs further to the east in the eastern portion of the coastal range, separated by the coastal &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Caribbean%20Dry%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Caribbean Dry Zone&lt;/a&gt;. There is a record from the &lt;a href=\"Orinoco%20Delta\"&gt;Orinoco Delta&lt;/a&gt; of northeastern Venezuela, well within the range of \"Hylaeamys megacephalus\", but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens. The species has also been found on the narrow strip between the &lt;a href=\"Llanos\"&gt;Llanos&lt;/a&gt; and the Andes (&lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20Oriental%20%28Colombia%29\"&gt;Cordillera Oriental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20de%20M%C3%A9rida\"&gt;Cordillera de M\u00e9rida&lt;/a&gt;) in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. The unforested Llanos separate these areas from \"Hylaeamys\" populations. \"&lt;a href=\"Hylaeamys%20perenensis\"&gt;Hylaeamys perenensis&lt;/a&gt;\" does, however, occur further south along the eastern foothills of the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia and it is possible that the two overlap in this area.\nEcology and behavior.\n\"Transandinomys talamancae\" is a common, even abundant, species. Its ecology was studied by Theodore Fleming in the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Zone\"&gt;Panama Canal Zone&lt;/a&gt;. It lives on the ground and is &lt;a href=\"nocturnal\"&gt;active during the night&lt;/a&gt;. The animal nests above ground level and occasionally enters burrows also used by the pocket mouse \"&lt;a href=\"Liomys%20adspersus\"&gt;Liomys adspersus&lt;/a&gt;\". Its diet is &lt;a href=\"omnivorous\"&gt;omnivorous&lt;/a&gt;: including both plant material such as seeds and fruits; and adult and larval insects.\nMales tend to travel longer distances than females. The average home range size in Fleming's study was 1.33\u00a0&lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt;s (3.3\u00a0&lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens that were once captured tended to be captured more frequently than those that had never been captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October\u2013November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).\nIn Panama, this species breeds year-round without apparent seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's \"Mam\u00edferos de Venezuela\" (\"Mammals of Venezuela\"), reproductive activity is highest in June\u2013July and December. In the laboratory, the &lt;a href=\"gestation%20period\"&gt;gestation period&lt;/a&gt; is 28\u00a0days; Linares reports 20 to 30\u00a0days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year and there are two to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50\u00a0days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live for more than a year in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9\u00a0months.\nTen species of mites (\"&lt;a href=\"Gigantolaelaps%20aitkeni\"&gt;Gigantolaelaps aitkeni&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gigantolaelaps%20gilmorei\"&gt;Gigantolaelaps gilmorei&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gigantolaelaps%20oudemansi\"&gt;Gigantolaelaps oudemansi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gigantolaelaps%20wolffsohni\"&gt;Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Haemolaelaps%20glasgowi\"&gt;Haemolaelaps glasgowi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Laelaps%20dearmasi\"&gt;Laelaps dearmasi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Laelaps%20pilifer\"&gt;Laelaps pilifer&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Laelaps%20thori\"&gt;Laelaps thori&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mysolaelaps%20parvispinosus\"&gt;Mysolaelaps parvispinosus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Paraspeleognathopsis%20cricetidarum\"&gt;Paraspeleognathopsis cricetidarum&lt;/a&gt;\"), thirteen chiggers (\"&lt;a href=\"Aitkenius%20cunctatus\"&gt;Aitkenius cunctatus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Ascoschoengastia%20dyscrita\"&gt;Ascoschoengastia dyscrita&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Eutrombicula%20alfreddugesi\"&gt;Eutrombicula alfreddugesi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Eutrombicula%20goeldii\"&gt;Eutrombicula goeldii&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Intercutestrix%20tryssa\"&gt;Intercutestrix tryssa&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Leptotrombidium%20panamensis\"&gt;Leptotrombidium panamensis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Myxacarus%20oscillatus\"&gt;Myxacarus oscillatus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pseudoschoengastia%20abditiva\"&gt;Pseudoschoengastia abditiva&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pseudoschoengastia%20bulbifera\"&gt;Pseudoschoengastia bulbifera&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Trombicula%20dunni\"&gt;Trombicula dunni&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Trombicula%20keenani\"&gt;Trombicula keenani&lt;/a&gt;\"), and four fleas (\"&lt;a href=\"Jellisonia\"&gt;Jellisonia&lt;/a&gt;\" sp., \"&lt;a href=\"Polygenis%20roberti\"&gt;Polygenis roberti&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Polygenis%20klagesi\"&gt;Polygenis klagesi&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Polygenis%20dunni\"&gt;Polygenis dunni&lt;/a&gt;\") have been found on \"T.\u00a0talamancae\" in Panama. \"G.\u00a0aitkeni\" has also been found on this species in Colombia.

It occurs in numerous &lt;a href=\"protected%20area\"&gt;protected area&lt;/a&gt;s, tolerates disturbed habitats well, and no important threats are known."
