Allin lost the match to Punk.\nProfessional wrestling style and persona.\nRatsch incorporates many elements of his personal life into his wrestling persona; a longtime fan of &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt;, Ratsch's current ring name Darby Allin is derived from the frontman of the &lt;a href=\"Germs%20%28band%29\"&gt;Germs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darby%20Crash\"&gt;Darby Crash&lt;/a&gt;, and the transgressive musician &lt;a href=\"GG%20Allin\"&gt;GG Allin&lt;/a&gt;, while his signature face paint, in which he paints half his face in a skull design, is born out of Ratsch's sentiment that he's been \"half dead\" since surviving the car accident in which his uncle died. Another aspect of Ratsch's background he incorporates into his wrestling is &lt;a href=\"skateboarding\"&gt;skateboarding&lt;/a&gt;, as he rides a skateboard to the ring during his entrance, and occasionally uses it as a weapon. Previous to his career taking off in professional wrestling, Ratsch also sought to be a professional skateboarder. Ratsch was initially hesitant to integrate his skateboarding into his pro wrestling work, fearing that both the wrestling and skateboarding fandoms would perceive it as inauthentic; however, he overcame his doubts following encouragement and advice from Chris Jericho.\nPersonal life.\nRatsch lives a &lt;a href=\"straight%20edge\"&gt;straight edge&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle, which he adopted in part due to a traumatic incident during his childhood: as a five-year-old, Ratsch was a passenger in a car when his uncle was &lt;a href=\"driving%20while%20intoxicated\"&gt;driving while intoxicated&lt;/a&gt;; his uncle lost control of the vehicle and was killed in the resulting crash. \nOn November 21, 2018, Ratsch married fellow wrestler &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Kelly\"&gt;Priscilla Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. On August 10, 2020, the couple announced they were divorcing. In December 2020, Kelly confirmed during an appearance on Vickie Guerrero's \"Excuse Me\" podcast that they were no longer married, but still remain friends."
