He returned to Paris, and was arrested several times for his writings: between 1787 and 1789, he is thought to have written about 1,500 lampoons. Among them, \"\"R\u00e9sum\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ou Extrait des cahiers de pouvoirs, instructions, demandes ou dol\u00e9ances remis par divers bailliages, s\u00e9n\u00e9chauss\u00e9es et pays d\u2019\u00c9tat du royaume\", written in collaboration with Laurent de Mezi\u00e8res and Jean Rousseau and published in three volumes in 1789, which was seized by the police.\nFrom July 12, 1789 to February 28, 1794, he published a newspaper, \"R\u00e9volutions de Paris\" () (\"Revolutions of Paris\"), whose principal writer was \u00c9lis\u00e9e Loustallot (), with &lt;a href=\"Sylvain%20Mar%C3%A9chal\"&gt;Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Gaspard%20Chaumette\"&gt;Pierre Gaspard Chaumette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fabre%20d%27%C3%89glantine\"&gt;Fabre d'\u00c9glantine&lt;/a&gt;, and which was a great success. At times imprisoned as a royalist, in June 1793, he moved away from &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and the political life.\nIn 1796 he published a two-volume work that was a list of all persons known to him who were sent to death during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1797, he published \"l\u2019Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise\" (6 volumes), work seized by the police. Then, from June\u2013October 1799, he published 105 issues of a daily newspaper, \"le Voyageur\".\nIn 1799, Prudhomme became director of the hospitals of Paris, but continued to work as a printer, publisher, and writer-compiler. Hostile to the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, he welcomed the &lt;a href=\"Bourbon%20Restoration%20in%20France\"&gt;Bourbon Restoration&lt;/a&gt; and in 1825 published \"L\u2019Europe tourment\u00e9e par la R\u00e9volution de France, \u00e9branl\u00e9e par dix-huit ann\u00e9es de promenades meurtri\u00e8res de &lt;a href=\"Napol%C3%A9on%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt;\", in two volumes.
