    "text": "The Last Enemy is a five-part &lt;a href=\"BBC%20television\"&gt;BBC television&lt;/a&gt; drama starring &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20Cumberbatch\"&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch&lt;/a&gt; and featuring &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Carlyle\"&gt;Robert Carlyle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Beesley\"&gt;Max Beesley&lt;/a&gt;. It first aired on 17 February 2008.\nPlot.\nSet in a recognisable, near-future London beset by terrorism and &lt;a href=\"illegal%20immigration\"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Last Enemy\" features the introduction of \"TIA\" (&lt;a href=\"Total%20Information%20Awareness\"&gt;Total Information Awareness&lt;/a&gt;), a centralised &lt;a href=\"database\"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to track and monitor anybody, effectively by putting all available government and corporate\u00a0\u2013 i.e. credit card and bank activity, phone use, internet use, purchases, rentals, etc.\u00a0\u2013 information in one place.\nThe story deals with a political cover-up centred on a sanctioned but secret medical experiment run amok with key members of the government trying desperately to hide all evidence of their experimental batch of vaccine that seems to be causing a deadly &lt;a href=\"virus\"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;. The complex story unspools to reveal the moral, social and privacy concerns of this hypothetical TIA system in a post-&lt;a href=\"7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings\"&gt;7/7&lt;/a&gt; world, including such control mechanisms familiar to both real life and science fiction as retinal scans, fingerprint identification and ubiquitous camera and cellphone surveillance footage.\nThe story is told through the eyes of a mathematical genius, Stephen Ezard, who is portrayed as a recluse showing some signs of &lt;a href=\"obsessive-compulsive%20disorder\"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;. But the shy genius overcomes his own inhibitions to burrow into a highly compromised British government using his brilliance and their TIA system only to find himself ultimately trapped by the people he most trusts, and to learn he is a pawn in manipulative Security State machinations which take the people he most loves from him and compromise him forever."
