    "text": "Summer School is an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20films\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"horror%20film\"&gt;horror film&lt;/a&gt; created by Minnesota-based production company Random Creatureface Films.\nPlot synopsis.\nCharles runs a website that reviews \"the more macabre of the cinema world\" and he has stayed up a bit too late trying to catch up on his work ala a horror movie marathon. In his rapid absorption of an endless series of dark delicacies, Charles has emerged the next day, the first day of Summer School in a bit of a mental flux. He is slipping in and out of consciousness, into a realm of sadistic, genre bending nightmares that test his sanity and question his grip on reality.\nPolice incident.\nIn August 2005, St. Paul, Minnesota, police were called to a local neighborhood to investigate a possible shooting involving a parked car. The car contained \u201cblood\u201d and \u201cbrain matter\u201d on the seats, dashboard, and windows. After canvassing the area, the officers discovered the owner of the car, Lance Hendrickson, one of the directors. The blood and bits of brain were fake\u2014the officers were shown the scene from the then in-production film as proof.\nReception.\nDread Central calls the film \u201cwildly entertaining\u201d, saying it has \u201cset a new standard... for all other independent horror films, it is a sterling standard.\u201d Dread Central also reviewed the \u201cExtra Credit\u201d edition DVD, giving even more praise. The two articles give the film a 4.5 out of 5 and the special features a 4 out of 5.\nFatally Yours says it's \u201cwonderfully clever\u201d, \u201ca slice of horror heaven pie\u201d, and \u201ca film by horror fans, for horror fans.\u201d\nThe film was also nominated for several awards, winning Mike Nelson and Ben Trandem an award for Best Editing in 2007."
