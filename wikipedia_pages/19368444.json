    "text": "Lars-Erik Torph (11 January 1961 \u2013 23 January 1989) was a &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rallying\"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; driver. He debuted in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rally%20Championship\"&gt;World Rally Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and took his first points at his home event, the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Rally\"&gt;Swedish Rally&lt;/a&gt;, in 1984. Driving a &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Celica\"&gt;Toyota Celica TCT&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Supra\"&gt;Toyota Supra 3.0i&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Audi%20Coup%C3%A9%20Quattro\"&gt;Audi Coup\u00e9 Quattro&lt;/a&gt;, he went on to finish on the podium four times. After just turning 28, Torph and his co-driver &lt;a href=\"Bertil-Rune%20Rehnfeldt\"&gt;Bertil-Rune Rehnfeldt&lt;/a&gt; died while spectating the 1989 &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Carlo%20Rally\"&gt;Monte Carlo Rally&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Lancia\"&gt;Lancia&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Fiorio\"&gt;Alex Fiorio&lt;/a&gt; lost control of his &lt;a href=\"Lancia%20Delta%20Integrale\"&gt;Delta Integrale&lt;/a&gt; and crashed into them.\nCareer.\nTorph debuted in the World Rally Championship during the &lt;a href=\"1980%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1980 season&lt;/a&gt;, competing with a &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20142\"&gt;Volvo 142&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Rally\"&gt;Swedish Rally&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"1000%20Lakes%20Rally\"&gt;1000 Lakes Rally&lt;/a&gt; in Finland, retiring in both events. At his seventh WRC event, the 1984 Swedish Rally, he took his first WRC points by finishing fifth in an &lt;a href=\"Opel%20Ascona\"&gt;Opel Ascona&lt;/a&gt; for the Opel Team Sweden. In &lt;a href=\"1985%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, Torph drove to 11th place at his home event and then placed in the points at the 1000 Lakes Rally, taking ninth place in a &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen%20Golf%20GTI\"&gt;Volkswagen Golf GTI&lt;/a&gt; for the Swedish Junior Team.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1986%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1986 season&lt;/a&gt;, Torph competed in three rallies for &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Team%20Europe\"&gt;Toyota Team Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toyota\"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;'s factory WRC team. He took his &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Celica\"&gt;Toyota Celica TCT&lt;/a&gt; to second place at the endurance events &lt;a href=\"Safari%20Rally\"&gt;Safari Rally&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rallye%20C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire\"&gt;Rallye C\u00f4te d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, losing the wins to compatriot and teammate &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rn%20Waldeg%C3%A5rd\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Olympus%20Rally\"&gt;Olympus Rally&lt;/a&gt;, Torph finished fourth, but this time ahead of Waldeg\u00e5rd who took fifth place. Points from these events placed Torph sixth in drivers' world championship.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1987%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, Torph again had a three-event contract with Toyota. He started his season at the Swedish Rally and finished 11th in his privateer &lt;a href=\"Audi%2080%20Quattro\"&gt;Audi 80 Quattro&lt;/a&gt;. With a factory &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Supra\"&gt;Toyota Supra 3.0i&lt;/a&gt;, he finished third at the Safari Rally behind &lt;a href=\"Audi%20Sport\"&gt;Audi Sport&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hannu%20Mikkola\"&gt;Hannu Mikkola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walter%20R%C3%B6hrl\"&gt;Walter R\u00f6hrl&lt;/a&gt;, despite a &lt;a href=\"fever\"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt; that lasted almost the duration of the event. At the Olympus Rally, he retired due to an engine problem. On the second day of the Rallye C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Toyota's &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20340\"&gt;Cessna 340&lt;/a&gt; aircraft crashed down and exploded, killing manager &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Liddon%20%28driver%29\"&gt;Henry Liddon&lt;/a&gt;, his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator. Toyota boss &lt;a href=\"Ove%20Andersson\"&gt;Ove Andersson&lt;/a&gt; withdrew all the factory Supra Turbos from the event.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1988%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1988 season&lt;/a&gt;, Torph participated in only two WRC events. In Sweden, driving a privateer &lt;a href=\"Audi%20Coup%C3%A9%20Quattro\"&gt;Audi Coup\u00e9 Quattro&lt;/a&gt;, he took his fourth podium place finishing behind &lt;a href=\"Markku%20Al%C3%A9n\"&gt;Markku Al\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stig%20Blomqvist\"&gt;Stig Blomqvist&lt;/a&gt;. For the Safari Rally, Torph had a factory team contract with &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen\"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; but retired after his Golf GTI 16V developed an engine problem. Torph continued with the Coup\u00e9 Quattro for the Team &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen%20Group\"&gt;VAG&lt;/a&gt; Sweden in the &lt;a href=\"1989%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1989 season&lt;/a&gt; opener in Sweden, but retired after an ignition problem.\nDeath.\nAt the 1989 &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Carlo%20Rally\"&gt;Monte Carlo Rally&lt;/a&gt;, Torph was not competing but only doing the &lt;a href=\"Reconnaissance%20%28rallying%29\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; (\"recce\") to help fellow Swedish rally driver Fredrik Skoghag regarding &lt;a href=\"pacenotes\"&gt;pacenotes&lt;/a&gt; on icy surface. While taking a break from recce duties, Torph and his co-driver Bertil-Rune Rehnfeldt went to spectate the fifth stage of the rally. Italian driver &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Fiorio\"&gt;Alex Fiorio&lt;/a&gt; lost control of his &lt;a href=\"Lancia%20Delta%20Integrale\"&gt;Lancia Delta Integrale&lt;/a&gt;, and then regained it only to go off the road and down an embankment on the other side. At about 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), the car crashed into Torph and Rehnfeldt, killing both. Fiorio and his co-driver Luigi Pirollo were unhurt. Witnesses said that hitting a bump had caused Fiorio to lose control of his car. Skoghag withdrew from the event, and &lt;a href=\"Lancia\"&gt;Lancia&lt;/a&gt;'s factory team &lt;a href=\"Martini%20Racing\"&gt;Martini Lancia&lt;/a&gt; locked out the podium with drivers &lt;a href=\"Miki%20Biasion\"&gt;Miki Biasion&lt;/a&gt; 1st, &lt;a href=\"Didier%20Auriol\"&gt;Didier Auriol&lt;/a&gt; 2nd and &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Saby\"&gt;Bruno Saby&lt;/a&gt; 3rd."
