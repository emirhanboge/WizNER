    "text": "LuckyTV, created by Sander van de Pavert (&lt;a href=\"The%20Hague\"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt;, 1976), is a Dutch series of short videos, mostly used as closure of daily TV-show \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Wereld%20Draait%20Door\"&gt;De Wereld Draait Door&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"NPO%201\"&gt;NPO 1&lt;/a&gt;. In these videos, recent news items (usually from the same day) are shown with the actual voices of the people in the video replaced with Van de Pavert's voice, often making the characters say ridiculous things. On a regular basis, items are edited into the video that weren't originally there, such as a monster at the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Great-Britain\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; prince William and Kate Middleton.\nIn October 2016 LuckyTV received widespread attention after it released a parody video that made it appear that &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton\"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; were singing a &lt;a href=\"duet\"&gt;duet&lt;/a&gt; of the song &lt;a href=\"%28I%27ve%20Had%29%20The%20Time%20of%20My%20Life\"&gt;(I've Had) The Time of My Life&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates%2C%202016\"&gt;second USA presidential debate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"CNet\"&gt;CNet&lt;/a&gt; contributor Chris Matyszczyk wrote that the video \"offers the possibility of idyllic harmony where there is only conflict. That, of course, makes it comedy.\"\nHistory.\nVan de Pavert studied Graphic Design at the &lt;a href=\"Willem%20de%20Kooning%20Academy\"&gt;Willem de Kooning Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. His LuckyTV videos were first broadcast on national television in 2003, during &lt;a href=\"Vara%20Laat\"&gt;Vara Laat&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the clips were shown in &lt;a href=\"JENSEN%21\"&gt;JENSEN!&lt;/a&gt; and, since 2005, &lt;a href=\"De%20Wereld%20Draait%20Door\"&gt;De Wereld Draait Door&lt;/a&gt;."
