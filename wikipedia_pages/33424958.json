In later life, he took up golf, winning several tournaments at clubs in Western Australia, and went on to serve as president of the &lt;a href=\"Subiaco%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Subiaco Football Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nBorn to Oswald Oliver Lovelock and his wife, Rose Janey (n\u00e9e Ifould), in &lt;a href=\"Highgate%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Highgate&lt;/a&gt; on 28 August 1911, Lovelock played both cricket and football from an early age, representing Western Australia at a national schoolboys' carnival in 1926. He debuted for West Perth in the WANFL in 1932, and played in the club's 1932 premiership win. In total, he played 25 games for the club over three seasons from 1932 to 1934, kicking three goals, and also spent time with the club's reserve team in the West Australian National Football Association (WANFA).\nHe made his cricket debut for &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; in October 1932, against the &lt;a href=\"English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333\"&gt;touring MCC side&lt;/a&gt;, making 14 &lt;a href=\"not%20out\"&gt;not out&lt;/a&gt; and recording two &lt;a href=\"stumping\"&gt;stumping&lt;/a&gt;s.
