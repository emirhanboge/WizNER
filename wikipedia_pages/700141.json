    "text": "Semiclassical &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, or simply semiclassical refers to a theory in which one part of a system is described &lt;a href=\"quantum%20mechanics\"&gt;quantum mechanically&lt;/a&gt; whereas the other is treated &lt;a href=\"classical%20mechanics\"&gt;classically&lt;/a&gt;. For example, external &lt;a href=\"field%20%28physics%29\"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;s will be constant, or when changing will be classically described. In general, it incorporates a development in &lt;a href=\"exponent\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Planck%27s%20constant\"&gt;Planck's constant&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the classical physics of power 0, and the first nontrivial approximation to the power of (\u22121). In this case, there is a clear link between the quantum-mechanical system and the associated semi-classical and classical approximations, as it is similar in appearance to the transition from &lt;a href=\"physical%20optics\"&gt;physical optics&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"geometric%20optics\"&gt;geometric optics&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstances.\nSome examples of a semiclassical approximation include:"
