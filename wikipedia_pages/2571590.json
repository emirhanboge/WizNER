    "text": "A house painter and decorator is a &lt;a href=\"tradesman\"&gt;tradesman&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the painting and decorating of buildings, and is also known as a decorator or house painter. The purpose of painting is to improve the appearance of a building and to protect it from damage by water, corrosion, insects and mould. House painting can also be a form of artistic and/or cultural expression such as &lt;a href=\"Ndebele%20house%20painting\"&gt;Ndebele house painting&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory of the trade in England.\nIn England, little is known of the trade and its structures before the late 13th century, at which point &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s began to form, amongst them the Painters Company and the Stainers Company. These two guilds eventually merged with the consent of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London\"&gt;Lord Mayor of the City of London&lt;/a&gt; in 1502, forming the &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Painter-Stainers\"&gt;Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers&lt;/a&gt;. The guild standardised the craft and acted as a protector of the &lt;a href=\"trade%20secret\"&gt;trade secret&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1599, the guild asked Parliament for protection, which was eventually granted in a bill of 1606, which granted the trade protection from outside competition such as &lt;a href=\"plaster\"&gt;plaster&lt;/a&gt;ers.\nThe Act legislated for a seven-year &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;, and also barred plasterers from painting, unless apprenticed to a painter, with the penalty for such painting being a fine of \u00a35. The Act also enshrined a maximum daily fee of 16 &lt;a href=\"old%20pence\"&gt;old pence&lt;/a&gt; for their labour.\nEnforcement of this Act by the Painter-Stainers Company was sought up until the early 19th century, with &lt;a href=\"master%20craftsman\"&gt;master painters&lt;/a&gt; gathering irregularly to decide the fees that a &lt;a href=\"journeyman\"&gt;journeyman&lt;/a&gt; could charge, and also instigating an early version of a &lt;a href=\"job%20centre\"&gt;job centre&lt;/a&gt; in 1769, advertising in the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;s a \"house of call\" system to advertise for journeymen and also for journeymen to advertise for work. The guild's power in setting the fee a journeyman could charge was eventually overturned by law in 1827, and the period after this saw the guild's power diminish, along with that of the other guilds; the guilds were superseded by &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s, with the Operative United Painters' Union forming sometime around 1831.\nIn 1894, a national association formed, recreating itself in 1918 as the National Federation of Master Painters and Decorators of England and Wales, then changing its name once again to the British Decorators Association before merging, in 2002, with the Painting &amp; Decorating Federation to form the Painting &amp; Decorating Association. The Construction Industry Joint Council, a body formed of both unions and business organizations, today has responsibility for the setting of pay levels.\nActivities of the trade.\nHistorically, the painter was responsible for the mixing of the &lt;a href=\"paint\"&gt;paint&lt;/a&gt;; keeping a ready supply of &lt;a href=\"pigment\"&gt;pigment&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paint%20thinner\"&gt;thinner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20drying%20agent\"&gt;drier&lt;/a&gt;s. The painter would use his experience to determine a suitable mixture depending on the nature of the job. In modern times, the painter is primarily responsible for preparation of the surface to be painted, such as patching holes in &lt;a href=\"drywall\"&gt;drywall&lt;/a&gt;, using masking tape and other protection on surfaces not to be painted, applying the paint and then cleaning up.\nLarger firms operating within the trade were generally capable of performing many painting or decoration services, from creating an &lt;a href=\"accent%20wall\"&gt;accent wall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"signwriter\"&gt;sign writing&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"gilding\"&gt;gilding&lt;/a&gt; of objects or the &lt;a href=\"wood%20finishing\"&gt;finishing&lt;/a&gt; or refinishing of &lt;a href=\"furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt;.\nPainter-work is described in the 1911 &lt;a href=\"Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition\"&gt;Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition&lt;/a&gt; where the relevant skills include preparing surfaces, mixing paint, &lt;a href=\"gilding\"&gt;gilding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Distemper%20%28paint%29\"&gt;distemper&lt;/a&gt;, and faux-finishes including &lt;a href=\"marbleizing\"&gt;marbleizing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"graining\"&gt;graining&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore recently, professional painters are responsible for all preparation prior to painting. All stucco or popcorn or texture scraping, &lt;a href=\"sanding\"&gt;sanding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wallpaper\"&gt;wallpaper&lt;/a&gt; removal, &lt;a href=\"caulk\"&gt;caulk&lt;/a&gt;ing, drywall or &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; repair, patching, &lt;a href=\"stain%20removal\"&gt;stain removal&lt;/a&gt;, filling &lt;a href=\"nail%20%28fastener%29\"&gt;nail&lt;/a&gt; holes or any defects with plaster or &lt;a href=\"putty\"&gt;putty&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning, &lt;a href=\"adhesive%20tape\"&gt;taping&lt;/a&gt;, preparation and priming are considered to be done by the professional &lt;a href=\"independent%20contractor\"&gt;contracted&lt;/a&gt; painter."
