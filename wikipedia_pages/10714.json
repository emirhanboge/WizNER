    "text": "The transport system of &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; is well-developed. Factors affecting traffic include the sparse population and long distance between towns and cities, and the cold climate with waterways freezing and land covered in snow for winter.\nThe extensive road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. , the country's network of main roads has a total length of around and all public roads . The motorway network totals with additional reserved only for motor traffic. Road network expenditure of around \u20ac1\u00a0billion is paid with vehicle and &lt;a href=\"fuel%20tax\"&gt;fuel tax&lt;/a&gt;es that amount to around \u20ac1.5\u00a0billion and \u20ac1\u00a0billion, respectively.\nThe main international passenger gateway is &lt;a href=\"Helsinki-Vantaa%20Airport\"&gt;Helsinki-Vantaa Airport&lt;/a&gt; with over 20 million passengers in 2018. About 25 airports have scheduled passenger services. They are financed by competitive fees and rural airport may be subsidized. The Helsinki-Vantaa based &lt;a href=\"Finnair\"&gt;Finnair&lt;/a&gt; (known for an Asia-focused strategy), &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Regional%20Airlines\"&gt;Nordic Regional Airlines&lt;/a&gt; provide air services both domestically and internationally. Helsinki has an optimal location for &lt;a href=\"great%20circle\"&gt;great circle&lt;/a&gt; routes between Western Europe and the Far East. Hence, many international travelers visit Helsinki on a stop-over between Asia and Europe.\nDespite low population density, taxpayers spend annually around \u20ac350 million in maintaining railway tracks even to many rural towns. Operations are privatized and currently the only operator is the state-owned &lt;a href=\"VR%20%28company%29\"&gt;VR&lt;/a&gt;. It has 5 percent passenger market share (out of which 80 percent are urban trips in Greater Helsinki) and 25 percent cargo market share. Helsinki has an urban rail network.\nIcebreakers keep the 23 ports open all year round. There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku, which have ferry connections to &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mariehamn\"&gt;Mariehamn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and several other destinations.\nRoads.\nRoad transport in Finland is the most popular method of transportation, particularly in rural areas where the railway network does not extend to. there are of public roads, of which are paved. The main road network comprises over of road.\nHighways.\n64% of all traffic on public roads takes place on main roads, which are divided into &lt;a href=\"Highways%20in%20Finland\"&gt;class I&lt;/a&gt; (\"/\") and class II (\"/\") main roads. Motorways have been constructed in the country since the 1960s, but they are still reasonably rare because traffic volumes are not large enough to motivate their construction. There are of motorways. Longest stretches are &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20national%20road%201\"&gt;Main road 1&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E18\"&gt;E18&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Vantaa\"&gt;Vantaa&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Yl%C3%B6j%C3%A4rvi\"&gt;Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20national%20road%203\"&gt;Main road 3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E12\"&gt;E12&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Heinola\"&gt;Heinola&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20national%20road%204\"&gt;Main road 4&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E75\"&gt;E75&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Vaalimaa\"&gt;Vaalimaa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20national%20road%207\"&gt;Main road 7&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E18\"&gt;E18&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"The%20world%27s%20most%20northern\"&gt;The world's northernmost motorway&lt;/a&gt; is also located in Finland between &lt;a href=\"Keminmaa\"&gt;Keminmaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornio\"&gt;Tornio&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20national%20road%2029\"&gt;Main road 29&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E8\"&gt;E8&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are no &lt;a href=\"toll%20road\"&gt;toll road&lt;/a&gt;s in Finland.\nSpeed limits.\nSpeed limits change depending on the time of the year; the maximum speed limit on motorways is in the summer and in the winter. The main roads usually have speed limits of either 100\u00a0km/h or . Speed limits in urban areas range between and . If no other speed limit is signposted, the general speed limit in Finland is in built-up areas and outside.\nVehicles.\n, there are 4,95\u00a0million registered &lt;a href=\"automobile\"&gt;automobile&lt;/a&gt;s, of which 2,58\u00a0million cars. Average age of cars (museum cars excluded) is 12,5 years (in some regions even 15 years), and typically the cars are destroyed in age of 24 years. In 2015, ca. 123\u00a0000 new vehicles were registered in Finland. About 550,000\u2013600,000 used automobiles are sold each year in Finland. During 2011\u20132014 the most sold car brand was Volkswagen. It had a market share of 12% of new cars.\nPublic transport.\n&lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Coaches&lt;/a&gt; are mainly operated by private companies and provide services widely across the country. There is a large network of &lt;a href=\"ExpressBus\"&gt;ExpressBus&lt;/a&gt; services with connections to all major cities and the most important rural areas as well as a burgeoning &lt;a href=\"OnniBus\"&gt;OnniBus&lt;/a&gt; 'cheap bus' network. Coach stations are operated by &lt;a href=\"Matkahuolto\"&gt;Matkahuolto&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocal bus services inside cities and towns have often been tightly regulated by the councils. Many councils also have their own bus operators, such as &lt;a href=\"Tampere%20City%20Transit\"&gt;Tampere City Transit&lt;/a&gt; (TKL), which operates some bus lines on a commercial basis in competition with privately owned providers. Regional bus lines have been regulated by the provincial administration to protect old transit companies, leading to &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; situations like &lt;a href=\"TLO\"&gt;TLO&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; region, but strong regional regulating bodies, like the &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20Regional%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;Helsinki Regional Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt; (HSL/HRT), whose routes are put out to tender exist as well and will become the norm after the transitional period during the 2010s.\nAccidents.\nIn 2015, number of road traffic accidents involving personal injury was 5,164. In them, 266 persons were killed. The number of road deaths per million inhabitants is just below the European average. Traffic safety has improved significantly since the early 1970s, when more than one thousand people died in road traffic every year.\nParking.\nMunicipal law 30-31 \u00a7 gives right to &lt;a href=\"Referendum\"&gt;Referendum&lt;/a&gt; since year 1990. Citizens of &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; collected 15,000 names in one month for referendum against the underground car park. Politicians with in the elections unknown financing from the parking company neglected the citizens opinion. According to International Association of Public Transport &lt;a href=\"UITP\"&gt;UITP&lt;/a&gt; parking places are the among the most effective ways to promote private car use in the city. Therefore, many European cities have cancelled the expensive underground car parking after the 1990s. The EU recommended actions cover develop guidance for concrete measures for the internalisation of external costs for car traffic also in urban areas. In Finland the shops routinely offer free parking for private cars.\nRail transport.\nRailways.\nThe Finnish railway network consists of a total of of railways built with . of track is electrified. In 2010, passengers made 13.4\u00a0million long-distance voyages and 55.5\u00a0million trips in local traffic. On the same year, over of freight were transported.\nPassenger trains are operated by the state-owned &lt;a href=\"VR%20%28company%29\"&gt;VR&lt;/a&gt;. They serve all the major cities and many rural areas, complemented by bus connections where needed. Most passenger train services originate or terminate at &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20Central%20railway%20station\"&gt;Helsinki Central railway station&lt;/a&gt;, and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of Helsinki. High-speed &lt;a href=\"VR%20Class%20Sm3\"&gt;Pendolino&lt;/a&gt; services are operated from Helsinki to other major cities like &lt;a href=\"Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4\"&gt;Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joensuu\"&gt;Joensuu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuopio\"&gt;Kuopio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oulu\"&gt;Oulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt;. Modern &lt;a href=\"InterCity%23Finland\"&gt;InterCity&lt;/a&gt; services complement the Pendolino network, and cheaper and older long and short-distance trains operate in areas with fewer passengers.\nThe Helsinki area has three &lt;a href=\"urban%20rail\"&gt;urban rail&lt;/a&gt; systems: a &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20tram\"&gt;tramway&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20Metro\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20commuter%20rail\"&gt;commuter rail system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Light%20rail\"&gt;Light rail&lt;/a&gt; systems are currently being planned for &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; and also for &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt;, two of the country's other major urban centres.\nHigh-speed rail.\nThere are plans to link Helsinki to Turku and Tampere by high-speed lines resulting in journey times of an hour between the capital and the two cities. A link to &lt;a href=\"Kouvola\"&gt;Kouvola&lt;/a&gt; is also planned. The estimated cost of these lines is \u20ac10 billion.\nTrams and light rail.\nIn Finland there have been three cities with trams: &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viipuri\"&gt;Viipuri&lt;/a&gt;. Only Helsinki has retained &lt;a href=\"Trams%20in%20Helsinki\"&gt;its tramway network&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"trams%20in%20Viipuri\"&gt;trams in Viipuri&lt;/a&gt;, having been lost to &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, ceased operations in 1957, while the &lt;a href=\"trams%20in%20Turku\"&gt;Turku tramway network&lt;/a&gt; shut down in 1972.\nIn November 2016, &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt; city council approved the construction of a new &lt;a href=\"Tampere%20light%20rail\"&gt;light rail system&lt;/a&gt;. Construction of phase 1 begun late 2016 and finished in 2021. Tampere trams are already operating but the official opening date is 9 august 2021. Turku also has preliminary plans for new tram system, but no decision to build it has been made.\nHelsinki currently operates 13 tramlines on a network of approximately of track in passenger service. The trams have annually 57 million passengers.\nAir transport.\nThere are 148 airfields, 74 of which have paved runways. 21 airports are served by scheduled passenger flights. By far the largest airport is &lt;a href=\"Helsinki-Vantaa%20Airport\"&gt;Helsinki-Vantaa Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and the second largest by passenger volume is &lt;a href=\"Oulu%20Airport\"&gt;Oulu Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The larger airports are managed by the state-owned &lt;a href=\"Finavia\"&gt;Finavia&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration). &lt;a href=\"Finnair\"&gt;Finnair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Regional%20Airlines\"&gt;Nordic Regional Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Air%20Shuttle\"&gt;Norwegian Air Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; are the main carriers for domestic flights.\nHelsinki-Vantaa airport is Finland's global gateway with scheduled non-stop flights to such places as &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, Beijing, &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagoya\"&gt;Nagoya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Helsinki has an optimal location for &lt;a href=\"great%20circle\"&gt;great circle&lt;/a&gt; airline traffic routes between Western Europe and the Far East. The airport is located approximately 19 kilometers north of Helsinki's downtown in the city of &lt;a href=\"Vantaa\"&gt;Vantaa&lt;/a&gt;, thus the name Helsinki-Vantaa.\nOther airports with regular scheduled international connections are &lt;a href=\"Kokkola-Pietarsaari%20Airport\"&gt;Kokkola-Pietarsaari Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mariehamn%20Airport\"&gt;Mariehamn Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tampere-Pirkkala%20Airport\"&gt;Tampere-Pirkkala Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turku%20Airport\"&gt;Turku Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vaasa%20Airport\"&gt;Vaasa Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater transport.\nThe Finnish Maritime Administration is responsible for the maintenance of Finland's waterway network. Finland's waterways includes some of coastal fairways and of Finland waterways (on rivers, canals, and lakes). &lt;a href=\"Saimaa%20Canal\"&gt;Saimaa Canal&lt;/a&gt; connects &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Saimaa\"&gt;Lake Saimaa&lt;/a&gt;, and thus much of the inland waterway system of Finland, with the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vyborg\"&gt;Vyborg&lt;/a&gt; (Viipuri). However, the lower part of the canal is currently located in Russia. To facilitate through shipping, Finland leases the Russian section of the canal from Russia (the original agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; dates to 1963).\nThe largest general port is Port of Hamina-Kotka. &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Helsinki\"&gt;Port of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; is the busiest passenger harbour, and it also has significant cargo traffic. By cargo tons, the five busiest ports are Hamina-Kotka, Helsinki, Rauma, Kilpilahti and &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Naantali\"&gt;Naantali&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Icebreaker\"&gt;Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;s keep 23 ports open for traffic even in winter. The ports in &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Bothnia\"&gt;Gulf of Bothnia&lt;/a&gt; need icebreakers in average six months a year, while in &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Gulf of Finland&lt;/a&gt; icebreakers are needed for three months a year.\nFrequent ferry service connects Finland with &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cruise%20liners\"&gt;cruise liners&lt;/a&gt; regularly call on the\nport of Helsinki as well. In domestic service, ferries connect Finland's islands with the mainland. Finland's cargo ports\nmove freight both for Finland's own needs and for &lt;a href=\"transshipment\"&gt;transshipment&lt;/a&gt; to Russia."
