    "text": "Alfred Lothar Wegener (; ; 1 November 1880\u00a0\u2013 November 1930) was a &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"climatologist\"&gt;climatologist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geologist\"&gt;geologist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geophysicist\"&gt;geophysicist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meteorologist\"&gt;meteorologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Polar%20regions%20of%20Earth\"&gt;polar researcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his lifetime he was primarily known for his achievements in meteorology and as a pioneer of polar research, but today he is most remembered as the originator of &lt;a href=\"continental%20drift\"&gt;continental drift&lt;/a&gt; hypothesis by suggesting in 1912 that the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s are slowly drifting around the Earth (German: \"\"). His hypothesis was controversial and widely rejected by mainstream &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt; until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as &lt;a href=\"palaeomagnetism\"&gt;palaeomagnetism&lt;/a&gt; provided strong support for continental drift, and thereby a substantial basis for today's model of &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;plate tectonics&lt;/a&gt;. Wegener was involved in several expeditions to &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; to study &lt;a href=\"Geographical%20pole\"&gt;polar&lt;/a&gt; air circulation before the existence of the &lt;a href=\"jet%20stream\"&gt;jet stream&lt;/a&gt; was accepted. Expedition participants made many meteorological observations and were the first to overwinter on the inland Greenland ice sheet and the first to bore &lt;a href=\"ice%20core\"&gt;ice core&lt;/a&gt;s on a moving Arctic glacier.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nAlfred Wegener was born in Berlin on 1 November 1880 as the youngest of five children in a clergyman's family. His father, Richard Wegener, was a theologian and teacher of classical languages at the &lt;a href=\"Berlinisches%20Gymnasium%20zum%20Grauen%20Kloster\"&gt;Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster&lt;/a&gt;. In 1886 his family purchased a former manor house near &lt;a href=\"Rheinsberg\"&gt;Rheinsberg&lt;/a&gt;, which they used as a vacation home. Today there is an Alfred Wegener Memorial site and tourist information office in a nearby building that was once the local schoolhouse.\nHe was cousin to film pioneer &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wegener\"&gt;Paul Wegener&lt;/a&gt;.\nWegener attended school at the ' on Wallstrasse in Berlin (a fact which is memorialized on a plaque on this protected building, now a school of music), graduating as the best in his class. Afterward he studied &lt;a href=\"Physics\"&gt;Physics&lt;/a&gt;, meteorology and &lt;a href=\"Astronomy\"&gt;Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Innsbruck\"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt;. From 1902 to 1903 during his studies he was an assistant at the &lt;a href=\"Urania%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Urania&lt;/a&gt; astronomical observatory. He obtained a doctorate in astronomy in 1905 based on a &lt;a href=\"thesis\"&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; written under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Bauschinger\"&gt;Julius Bauschinger&lt;/a&gt; at ' (today &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20University\"&gt;Humboldt University&lt;/a&gt;), Berlin. Wegener had always maintained a strong interest in the developing fields of &lt;a href=\"meteorology\"&gt;meteorology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"climatology\"&gt;climatology&lt;/a&gt; and his studies afterwards focused on these disciplines.\nIn 1905 Wegener became an assistant at the Aeronautisches Observatorium Lindenberg near &lt;a href=\"Beeskow\"&gt;Beeskow&lt;/a&gt;. He worked there with his brother &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Wegener\"&gt;Kurt&lt;/a&gt;, two years his senior, who was likewise a scientist with an interest in meteorology and polar research. The two pioneered the use of weather balloons to track air masses. On a balloon ascent undertaken to carry out meteorological investigations and to test a &lt;a href=\"celestial%20navigation\"&gt;celestial navigation&lt;/a&gt; method using a particular type of quadrant (\u201cLibellenquadrant\u201d), the Wegener brothers set a new record for a continuous balloon flight, remaining aloft 52.5 hours from 5\u20137 April 1906.\nFirst Greenland expedition and years in Marburg.\nIn that same year 1906, Wegener participated in the first of his four Greenland expeditions, later regarding this experience as marking a decisive turning point in his life. The &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20expedition\"&gt;Denmark expedition&lt;/a&gt; was led by the Dane &lt;a href=\"Ludvig%20Mylius-Erichsen\"&gt;Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen&lt;/a&gt; and charged with studying the last unknown portion of the northeastern coast of Greenland. During the expedition Wegener constructed the first meteorological station in Greenland near &lt;a href=\"Danmarkshavn\"&gt;Danmarkshavn&lt;/a&gt;, where he launched &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Moored%20balloon\"&gt;tethered balloons&lt;/a&gt; to make meteorological measurements in an &lt;a href=\"Arctic\"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt; climatic zone. Here Wegener also made his first acquaintance with death in a wilderness of ice when the expedition leader and two of his colleagues died on an exploratory trip undertaken with &lt;a href=\"sled%20dog\"&gt;sled dog&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter his return in 1908 and until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Wegener was a lecturer in meteorology, applied astronomy and cosmic physics at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Marburg\"&gt;University of Marburg&lt;/a&gt;. His students and colleagues in Marburg particularly valued his ability to clearly and understandably explain even complex topics and current research findings without sacrificing precision. His lectures formed the basis of what was to become a standard textbook in meteorology, first written In 1909/1910: \"Thermodynamik der Atmosph\u00e4re\" (Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere), in which he incorporated many of the results of the Greenland expedition.\nOn 6 January 1912 he publicized his first thoughts about continental drift in a lecture at a session of the Geologischen Vereinigung at the &lt;a href=\"Senckenberg%20Museum\"&gt;Senckenberg Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20am%20Main\"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt; and in three articles in the journal \"Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen\".\nSecond Greenland expedition.\nAfter a stopover in &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; to purchase and test &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20horse\"&gt;ponies&lt;/a&gt; as pack animals, the expedition arrived in Danmarkshavn. Even before the trip to the inland ice began the expedition was almost annihilated by a calving &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;. The Danish expedition leader, &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Peter%20Koch\"&gt;Johan Peter Koch&lt;/a&gt;, broke his leg when he fell into a glacier crevasse and spent months recovering in a sickbed. Wegener and Koch were the first to winter on the inland ice in northeast Greenland. Inside their hut they drilled to a depth of 25 m with an auger. In summer 1913 the team crossed the inland ice, the four expedition participants covering a distance twice as long as &lt;a href=\"Fridtjof%20Nansen\"&gt;Fridtjof Nansen&lt;/a&gt;'s southern Greenland crossing in 1888. Only a few kilometers from the western Greenland settlement of &lt;a href=\"Kangersuatsiaq\"&gt;Kangersuatsiaq&lt;/a&gt; the small team ran out of food while struggling to find their way through difficult glacial breakup terrain. But at the last moment, after the last pony and dog had been eaten, they were picked up at a &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt; by the clergyman of &lt;a href=\"Upernavik\"&gt;Upernavik&lt;/a&gt;, who just happened to be visiting a remote congregation at the time.\nFamily.\nLater in 1913, after his return Wegener married Else K\u00f6ppen, the daughter of his former teacher and mentor, the meteorologist &lt;a href=\"Wladimir%20K%C3%B6ppen\"&gt;Wladimir K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;. The young pair lived in &lt;a href=\"Marburg\"&gt;Marburg&lt;/a&gt;, where Wegner resumed his university lectureship. There his two older daughters were born, Hilde (1914\u20131936) and Sophie (\"K\u00e4te\", 1918\u20132012). Their third daughter Hanna Charlotte (\"Lotte\", 1920\u20131989) was born in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. Lotte would in 1938 marry the famous Austrian mountaineer and adventurer &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Harrer\"&gt;Heinrich Harrer&lt;/a&gt;, while in 1939, K\u00e4te married &lt;a href=\"Siegfried%20Uiberreither\"&gt;Siegfried Uiberreither&lt;/a&gt;, Austrian &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gauleiter\"&gt;Gauleiter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reichsgau%20Steiermark\"&gt;Styria&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War I.\nAs an infantry reserve officer Wegener was immediately called up when the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; began in 1914. On the war front in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; he experienced fierce fighting but his term lasted only a few months: after being wounded twice he was declared unfit for active service and assigned to the army weather service. This activity required him to travel constantly between various weather stations in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20region\"&gt;Baltic region&lt;/a&gt;.\nNevertheless, he was able in 1915 to complete the first version of his major work, \"Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane\" (\u201cThe Origin of Continents and Oceans\u201d). His brother Kurt remarked that Alfred Wegener's motivation was to \u201creestablish the connection between &lt;a href=\"geophysics\"&gt;geophysics&lt;/a&gt; on the one hand and &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt; on the other, which had become completely ruptured because of the specialized development of these branches of science.\u201d\nInterest in this small publication was however low, also because of wartime chaos. By the end of the war Wegener had published almost 20 additional meteorological and geophysical papers in which he repeatedly embarked for new scientific frontiers. In 1917 he undertook a scientific investigation of the &lt;a href=\"Treysa%20%28meteorite%29\"&gt;Treysa meteorite&lt;/a&gt;.\nPostwar period and third expedition.\nWegener obtained a position as a meteorologist at the German Naval Observatory (\"Deutsche Seewarte\") and moved to &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; with his wife and their two daughters. In 1921 he was appointed senior lecturer at the new &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Hamburg\"&gt;University of Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. From 1919 to 1923 Wegener did pioneering work on reconstructing the climate of past eras (now known as \"&lt;a href=\"paleoclimatology\"&gt;paleoclimatology&lt;/a&gt;\"), closely in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Milutin%20Milankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milutin Milankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, publishing \"Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit\" (\u201cThe Climates of the Geological Past\u201d) together with his father-in-law, Wladimir K\u00f6ppen, in 1924. In 1922 the third, fully revised edition of \u201cThe Origin of Continents and Oceans\u201d appeared, and discussion began on his theory of continental drift, first in the German language area and later internationally. Withering criticism was the response of most experts.\nIn 1924 Wegener was appointed to a professorship in meteorology and geophysics in &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Graz\"&gt;Graz&lt;/a&gt;, which finally provided him with a secure position for himself and his family. He concentrated on physics and the optics of the atmosphere as well as the study of &lt;a href=\"tornado\"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt;es. He had studied tornadoes for several years by this point, publishing the first thorough European &lt;a href=\"tornado%20climatology\"&gt;tornado climatology&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. He also posited tornado vortex structures and &lt;a href=\"Tornadogenesis\"&gt;formative processes&lt;/a&gt;. Scientific assessment of his second Greenland expedition (ice measurements, atmospheric optics, etc.) continued to the end of the 1920s.\nIn November 1926 Wegener presented his continental drift theory at a symposium of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20Petroleum%20Geologists\"&gt;American Association of Petroleum Geologists&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, again earning rejection from everyone but the chairman. Three years later the fourth and final expanded edition of \u201cThe Origin of Continents and Oceans\u201d appeared.\nIn 1929 Wegener embarked on his third trip to Greenland, which laid the groundwork for a later main expedition and included a test of an innovative, propeller-driven &lt;a href=\"Aerosani\"&gt;snowmobile&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth and last expedition.\nWegener's last Greenland expedition was in 1930. The 14 participants under his leadership were to establish three permanent stations from which the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet could be measured and year-round Arctic weather observations made. Wegener felt personally responsible for the expedition's success, as the &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;German government&lt;/a&gt; had contributed $120,000 ($1.5 million in 2007 dollars). Success depended on enough provisions being transferred from West camp to ' (\"mid-ice\") for two men to winter there, and this was a factor in the decision that led to his death. Owing to a late thaw, the expedition was six weeks behind schedule and, as summer ended, the men at ' sent a message that they had insufficient fuel and so would return on 20 October.\nOn 24 September, although the route markers were by now largely buried under snow, Wegener set out with thirteen Greenlanders and his meteorologist Fritz Loewe to supply the camp by dog sled. During the journey, the temperature reached and Loewe's toes became so frostbitten they had to be amputated with a penknife without anesthetic. Twelve of the Greenlanders returned to West camp. On 19 October the remaining three members of the expedition reached '. There being only enough supplies for three at ', Wegener and Rasmus Villumsen took two dog sleds and made for West camp. They took no food for the dogs and killed them one by one to feed the rest until they could run only one sled. While Villumsen rode the sled, Wegener had to use skis, but they never reached the camp: Wegener died and Villumsen was never seen again. The expedition was completed by his brother, Kurt Wegener.\nThis expedition inspired the Greenland expedition episode of Adam Melfort in &lt;a href=\"John%20Buchan\"&gt;John Buchan&lt;/a&gt;'s 1933 novel \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Prince%20of%20the%20Captivity\"&gt;A Prince of the Captivity&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDeath.\nWegener died in Greenland in November 1930 while returning from an expedition to bring food to a group of researchers camped in the middle of an icecap. He supplied the camp successfully, but there was not enough food at the camp for him to stay there. He and a colleague, Rasmus Villumsen, took dog sleds to travel to another camp although they never reached it. Villumsen had buried the body with great care, and a pair of skis marked the grave site. After burying Wegener, Villumsen had resumed his journey to West camp, but was never seen again. Six months later, on 12 May 1931, &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Wegener\"&gt;Kurt Wegener&lt;/a&gt; discovered his brother's grave halfway between \"\" and West camp. He and other expedition members built a pyramid-shaped &lt;a href=\"mausoleum\"&gt;mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; in the ice and snow, and Alfred Wegener's body was laid to rest in it. Wegener had been 50 years of age and a heavy smoker, and it was believed that he had died of &lt;a href=\"heart%20failure\"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; brought on by &lt;a href=\"overexertion\"&gt;overexertion&lt;/a&gt;. Villumsen was 23 when he died, and it is estimated that his body, and Wegener's diary, now lie under more than of accumulated ice and snow.\nContinental drift theory.\nAlfred Wegener first thought of this idea by noticing that the different large landmasses of the Earth almost fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The &lt;a href=\"continental%20shelf\"&gt;continental shelf&lt;/a&gt; of the Americas fits closely to Africa and Europe. Antarctica, Australia, India and Madagascar fit next to the tip of Southern Africa. But Wegener only published his idea after reading a paper in 1911 which criticized the prevalent hypothesis, that a bridge of land once connected Europe and America, on the grounds that this contradicts &lt;a href=\"isostasy\"&gt;isostasy&lt;/a&gt;. Wegener's main interest was meteorology, and he wanted to join the Denmark-Greenland expedition scheduled for mid-1912. He presented his Continental Drift hypothesis on 6 January 1912. He analyzed both sides of the Atlantic Ocean for rock type, geological structures and fossils. He noticed that there was a significant similarity between matching sides of the continents, especially in &lt;a href=\"fossil%20plants\"&gt;fossil plants&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1912, Wegener publicly advocated the existence of \"&lt;a href=\"continental%20drift\"&gt;continental drift&lt;/a&gt;\", arguing that all the continents were once joined together in a single landmass and had since drifted apart. He supposed that the mechanisms causing the drift might be the centrifugal force of the Earth's rotation (\"\") or the astronomical &lt;a href=\"precession\"&gt;precession&lt;/a&gt;. Wegener also speculated about &lt;a href=\"sea-floor%20spreading\"&gt;sea-floor spreading&lt;/a&gt; and the role of the &lt;a href=\"mid-ocean%20ridge\"&gt;mid-ocean ridge&lt;/a&gt;s, stating that \"the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot &lt;a href=\"Sima%20%28geology%29\"&gt;sima&lt;/a&gt; [rising] from depth.\" However, he did not pursue these ideas in his later works.\nIn 1915, in the first edition of his book, \"\", written in German, \nWegener drew together evidence from various fields to advance the theory that there had once been a giant continent, which he named \"\" \n(German for \"primal continent\", analogous to the Greek \"&lt;a href=\"Pangaea\"&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt;\", \nmeaning \"All-Lands\" or \"All-Earth\"). Expanded editions during the 1920s presented further evidence. (The first English edition was published in 1924 as \"The Origin of Continents and Oceans\", a translation of the 1922 third German edition.) The last German edition, published in 1929, revealed the significant observation that shallower oceans were geologically younger. It was, however, not translated into English until 1962.\nReaction.\nIn his work, Wegener presented a large amount of observational evidence in support of continental drift, but the mechanism remained a problem, partly because Wegener's estimate of the velocity of continental motion, 250\u00a0cm/year, was too high. (The currently accepted rate for the separation of the Americas from Europe and Africa is about 2.5\u00a0cm/year.)\nWhile his ideas attracted a few early supporters such as &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Du%20Toit\"&gt;Alexander Du Toit&lt;/a&gt; from South Africa, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Holmes\"&gt;Arthur Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in England and &lt;a href=\"Milutin%20Milankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milutin Milankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in Serbia, for whom &lt;a href=\"continental%20drift\"&gt;continental drift&lt;/a&gt; theory was the premise for investigating polar wandering, \nthe hypothesis was initially met with skepticism from geologists, who viewed Wegener as an outsider and were resistant to change. The one American edition of Wegener's work, published in 1925, which was written in \"a dogmatic style that often results from German translations\", was received so poorly that the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20Petroleum%20Geologists\"&gt;American Association of Petroleum Geologists&lt;/a&gt; organized a symposium specifically in opposition to the continental drift hypothesis. The opponents argued, as did the &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;er geologist &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Kossmat\"&gt;Franz Kossmat&lt;/a&gt;, that the oceanic crust was too firm for the continents to \"simply plough through\".\nFrom at least 1910, Wegener imagined the continents once fitting together not at the current shore line, but 200 m &lt;a href=\"isobath\"&gt;below this&lt;/a&gt;, at the level of the &lt;a href=\"continental%20shelves\"&gt;continental shelves&lt;/a&gt;, where they match well. Part of the reason Wegener's ideas were not initially accepted was the misapprehension that he was suggesting the continents had fit along the current coastline. &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Schuchert\"&gt;Charles Schuchert&lt;/a&gt; commented:\nWegener was in the audience for this lecture, but made no attempt to defend his work, possibly because of an inadequate command of the English language.\nIn 1943, &lt;a href=\"George%20Gaylord%20Simpson\"&gt;George Gaylord Simpson&lt;/a&gt; wrote a strong critique of the theory (as well as the rival theory of sunken land bridges) and gave evidence for the idea that similarities of &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; between the continents could best be explained by these being fixed land masses which over time were connected and disconnected by periodic flooding, a theory known as &lt;a href=\"permanentism\"&gt;permanentism&lt;/a&gt;. Alexander du Toit wrote a rejoinder to this the following year.\nModern developments.\nIn the early 1950s, the new science of &lt;a href=\"paleomagnetism\"&gt;paleomagnetism&lt;/a&gt; pioneered at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"S.%20K.%20Runcorn\"&gt;S. K. Runcorn&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College\"&gt;Imperial College&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"P.M.S.%20Blackett\"&gt;P.M.S. Blackett&lt;/a&gt; was soon producing data in favour of Wegener's theory. By early 1953 samples taken from India showed that the country had previously been in the Southern hemisphere as predicted by Wegener. By 1959, the theory had enough supporting data that minds were starting to change, particularly in the United Kingdom where, in 1964, the Royal Society held a symposium on the subject.\nThe 1960s saw several relevant developments in geology, notably the discoveries of &lt;a href=\"seafloor%20spreading\"&gt;seafloor spreading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wadati%E2%80%93Benioff%20zone\"&gt;Wadati\u2013Benioff zone&lt;/a&gt;s, and this led to the rapid resurrection of the continental drift hypothesis in the form of its direct descendant, the theory of &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;plate tectonics&lt;/a&gt;. Maps of the &lt;a href=\"geomorphology\"&gt;geomorphology&lt;/a&gt; of the ocean floors created by &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Tharp\"&gt;Marie Tharp&lt;/a&gt; in cooperation with &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Heezen\"&gt;Bruce Heezen&lt;/a&gt; were an important contribution to the &lt;a href=\"paradigm%20shift\"&gt;paradigm shift&lt;/a&gt; that was starting. Wegener was then recognized as the founding father of one of the major scientific revolutions of the 20th century.\nWith the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Positioning%20System\"&gt;Global Positioning System&lt;/a&gt; (GPS), it became possible to measure continental drift directly.\nAwards and honors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Wegener%20Institute%20for%20Polar%20and%20Marine%20Research\"&gt;Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bremerhaven\"&gt;Bremerhaven&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, was established in 1980 on Wegener's centenary. It awards the Wegener Medal in his name. The crater &lt;a href=\"Wegener%20%28lunar%20crater%29\"&gt;Wegener&lt;/a&gt; on the Moon and the crater &lt;a href=\"Wegener%20%28Martian%20crater%29\"&gt;Wegener&lt;/a&gt; on Mars, as well as the &lt;a href=\"asteroid\"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"29227%20Wegener\"&gt;29227 Wegener&lt;/a&gt; and the peninsula where he died in Greenland (Wegener Peninsula near Ummannaq, ), are named after him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"European%20Geosciences%20Union\"&gt;European Geosciences Union&lt;/a&gt; sponsors an Alfred Wegener Medal &amp; Honorary Membership \"for scientists who have achieved exceptional international standing in atmospheric, hydrological or ocean sciences, defined in their widest senses, for their merit and their scientific achievements.\""
