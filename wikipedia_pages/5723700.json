    "text": "Bagyidaw (, ; also known as Sagaing Min, ; 23 July 1784 \u2013 15 October 1846) was the seventh &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Konbaung%20dynasty\"&gt;Konbaung dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt; from 1819 until his abdication in 1837. Prince of &lt;a href=\"Sagaing\"&gt;Sagaing&lt;/a&gt;, as he was commonly known in his day, was selected as &lt;a href=\"crown%20prince\"&gt;crown prince&lt;/a&gt; by his grandfather King &lt;a href=\"Bodawpaya\"&gt;Bodawpaya&lt;/a&gt; in 1808, and became king in 1819 after Bodawpaya's death. Bagyidaw moved the capital from &lt;a href=\"Amarapura\"&gt;Amarapura&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Inwa\"&gt;Ava&lt;/a&gt; in 1823.\nBagyidaw's reign saw the &lt;a href=\"First%20Anglo-Burmese%20War\"&gt;First Anglo-Burmese War&lt;/a&gt; (1824\u20131826), which marked the beginning of the decline of the Konbaung dynasty. Bagyidaw inherited the largest Burmese empire, second only to King &lt;a href=\"Bayinnaung\"&gt;Bayinnaung&lt;/a&gt;'s, but also one that shared ill-defined borders with &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;. In the years leading to the war, the king had been forced to suppress British supported rebellions in his grandfather's western acquisitions (&lt;a href=\"Rakhine%20State\"&gt;Arakan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manipur\"&gt;Manipur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;), but unable to stem cross border raids from &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; territories and protectorates. His ill-advised decision to allow the Burmese army to pursue the rebels along the vaguely defined borders led to the war. The longest and most expensive war in &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;n history ended decisively in British favor, and the Burmese had to accept British terms without discussion. Bagyidaw was forced to cede all of his grandfather's western acquisitions, and &lt;a href=\"Tanintharyi%20Region\"&gt;Tenasserim&lt;/a&gt; to the British, and pay a large indemnity of one million &lt;a href=\"pounds%20sterling\"&gt;pounds sterling&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the country crippled for years.\nDevastated, Bagyidaw held out hope for some years that Tenasserim would be returned to him, and paid the balance of indemnity in 1832 at great sacrifice. The British redrew the border with Manipur in 1830, but by 1833, it was clear the British would not return any of the former territories. The king became a recluse, and power devolved to his queen &lt;a href=\"Nanmadaw%20Me%20Nu\"&gt;Nanmadaw Me Nu&lt;/a&gt; (born in &lt;a href=\"Pha%20Lan%20Gon\"&gt;Pha Lan Gon&lt;/a&gt;) and her brother. His brother Crown Prince &lt;a href=\"Tharrawaddy%20Min\"&gt;Tharrawaddy&lt;/a&gt; raised a rebellion in February 1837, and Bagyidaw was forced to abdicate the throne in April 1837. King Tharrawaddy executed Queen Me Nu and her brother but placed his brother under house arrest. Bagyidaw died on 15 October 1846, at age 62.\nEarly life.\nThe future king was born &lt;a href=\"Burmese%20name%23Honorifics\"&gt;Maung&lt;/a&gt; Sein to Crown Prince &lt;a href=\"Thado%20Minsaw\"&gt;Thado Minsaw&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Shwedaung and his half-sister Min Kye, Princess of Taungdwin, on 23 July 1784. The infant prince was granted &lt;a href=\"Sagaing\"&gt;Sagaing&lt;/a&gt; as his &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt; by his grandfather King Bodawpaya, hence known as Prince of Sagaing. On 23 June 1793, the young prince, not yet 9, was made a general of the Northern and Southern Corps of Royal Cavalry. On 9 February 1803, the 18-year-old prince married 14-year-old Princess &lt;a href=\"Hsinbyume\"&gt;Hsinbyume&lt;/a&gt;, a granddaughter of Bodawpaya. The young prince was fond of shows, theater, elephant catching and boat racing.\nCrown Prince.\nHis father Crown Prince Thado Minsaw died on 9 April 1808. Nine days later, the young prince at 23 was suddenly elevated to the position of Crown Prince by his grandfather King Bodawpaya. The prince was also allowed to inherit his father's fiefs of Dabayin and Shwedaung. The Crown Prince was Master-General of the Ordnance in the Burmese-Siamese War of 1808, which ended in a stalemate. His elevation to crown prince also brought his royal servants, including Maung Yit (later Gen. &lt;a href=\"Maha%20Bandula\"&gt;Maha Bandula&lt;/a&gt;) of Dabayin and Maung Sa (later &lt;a href=\"Myawaddy%20Mingyi%20U%20Sa\"&gt;Lord of Myawaddy&lt;/a&gt;) of Sagaing to prominence. Myawaddy became his longtime adviser and personal secretary (\"atwinwn\") until his abdication in 1837. He promoted Maung Yit to governor of Ahlon-Monywa.\nIn 1812, his first queen Princess Hsinbyume died of childbirth in &lt;a href=\"Mingun\"&gt;Mingun&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Inwa\"&gt;Ava&lt;/a&gt;. The crown prince built a beautiful white &lt;a href=\"stupa\"&gt;stupa&lt;/a&gt; in memory of his first wife named &lt;a href=\"Hsinbyume%20Pagoda\"&gt;Myatheindan Pagoda&lt;/a&gt; at Mingun. He took on five more queens as crown prince (of the eventual number of 23 queens). His third and later chief queen &lt;a href=\"Nanmadaw%20Me%20Nu\"&gt;Nanmadaw Me Nu&lt;/a&gt; built the Maha Aungmye Bonzan Monastery in 1818, more commonly known as \"Me Nu Ok Kyaung\" (Me Nu's Brick Monastery), unusual in that Burmese monasteries traditionally are wooden structures.\nDuring his stay as crown prince, his grandfather Bodawpaya renewed his expansionism in the west. In February 1814, a Burmese expeditionary force invaded Manipur, placing &lt;a href=\"Marjit%20Singh\"&gt;Marjit Singh&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up in Ava, as vassal king.\nIn 1816, the &lt;a href=\"Ahom%20people\"&gt;Ahom&lt;/a&gt; governor of &lt;a href=\"Guwahati\"&gt;Guwahati&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, Badan Chandra &lt;a href=\"Borphukan\"&gt;Borphukan&lt;/a&gt; visited the court of Bodawpaya to seek help in order to defeat his political rival Purnananda &lt;a href=\"Burhagohain\"&gt;Burhagohain&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of &lt;a href=\"Ahom%20Kingdom\"&gt;Ahom Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;. A strong force of 16,000 under the command of Gen. Maha Minhla Minkhaung was sent with Badan Chandra &lt;a href=\"Borphukan\"&gt;Borphukan&lt;/a&gt;. The Burmese force entered Assam in January 1817 and defeated the Assamese force in the battle of Ghiladhari. Meanwhile, Purnananda Burhagohain died and Ruchinath &lt;a href=\"Burhagohain\"&gt;Burhagohain&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Purnananda Burahgohain fled to &lt;a href=\"Guwahati\"&gt;Guwahati&lt;/a&gt;. The reigning &lt;a href=\"Ahom%20people\"&gt;Ahom&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Sudingphaa\"&gt;Chandrakanta Singha&lt;/a&gt; came in terms with Badan Chandra &lt;a href=\"Borphukan\"&gt;Borphukan&lt;/a&gt; and his Burmese allies. He appointed Badan Chandra Borphukan as Mantri Phukan (Prime Minister). An &lt;a href=\"Ahom%20people\"&gt;Ahom&lt;/a&gt; princess Hemo Aideo was given for marriage to Burmese King Bodawpaya along with many gifts to strengthen the ties with the Burmese monarch. The Burmese force returned to &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt; soon after. A year later, Badan Chandra Borphukan was assassinated and the Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha was deposed by rival political faction led by Ruchinath Burhagohain, the son of Purnananda Burhagohain. Chandrakanta Singha and the friends of Badan Chandra Borphukan appeal for help to Bodawpaya. In February 1819, the Burmese forces invaded Assam for second time and reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne of Assam.\nReign.\nTroubles on the western front.\nBodawpaya died on 5 June 1819, and Bagyidaw ascended to the throne without opposition. On 7 June 1819, he was crowned at Amarapura with the reign name of Sri Pawara Suriya Dharmaraja Maharajadhiraja. It was later expanded to Siri Tribhawanaditya Dhipati Pawara Pandita Mahadhammarajadhiraja. Bagyidaw inherited the second largest Burmese empire but also one that shared a long vaguely defined borders with &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;. The British, disturbed by the Burmese control of Manipur and Assam which threatened their own influence on the eastern borders of British India, supported rebellions in the region.\nThe first to test Bagyidaw's rule was the Raja of Manipur, who was put on the Manipuri throne only six years earlier by the Burmese. Raja Marjit Singh failed to attend Bagyidaw's coronation ceremony, or send an embassy bearing tributes, as all vassal kings had an obligation to do. In October 1819, Bagyidaw sent an expeditionary force of 25,000 soldiers and 3,000 cavalry led by his favorite general Maha Bandula to reclaim Manipur. Bandula reconquered Manipur but the raja escaped to neighboring Cachar, which was ruled by his brother &lt;a href=\"Chourjit%20Singh\"&gt;Chourjit Singh&lt;/a&gt;. The Singh brothers continued to raid Manipur using their bases from Cachar and Jaintia, which had been declared as British &lt;a href=\"protectorates\"&gt;protectorates&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe instabilities spread to Assam in 1821, when the &lt;a href=\"Ahom%20people\"&gt;Ahom&lt;/a&gt; king of &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudingphaa\"&gt;Chandrakanta Singha&lt;/a&gt; tried to shake off Burmese influence. He hired mercenaries from &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and began to strengthen the army. He also began to construct fortification to prevent further Burmese invasion. Bagyidaw again turned to Bandula. It took Bandula's 20,000-strong army about a year a half, until July 1822, to finish off the Assamese army. Bagyidaw now scrapped the six- century-old Assamese monarchy and made Assam a province under a military governor-general. This differs with the Assamese versions of history where it is written that Bagyidaw installed &lt;a href=\"Jogeswar%20Singha\"&gt;Jogeswar Singha&lt;/a&gt;, a brother of Hemo Aideo, the Ahom princess who was married to &lt;a href=\"Bodawpaya\"&gt;Bodawpaya&lt;/a&gt; as the new Ahom king of Assam and a military governor-general was appointed to look after the administration. The defeated Assamese king fled to British territory of &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. The British ignored Burmese demands to surrender the fugitive king, and instead sent reinforcement units to frontier forts. Despite their success in the open battlefield, the Burmese continued to have trouble with cross border raids by rebels from British protectorates of Cachar and Jaintia into Manipur and Assam, and those from British Bengal into Arakan.\nAt Bagyidaw's court, the war party which included Gen. Bandula, Queen Me Nu and her brother, the lord of Salin, made the case to Bagyidaw that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal. In January 1824, Bandula allowed one of his top lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Maha%20Uzana\"&gt;Maha Uzana&lt;/a&gt;, into Cachar and Jaintia to chase away the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan.\nWar.\nIn the beginning of the war, battle-hardened Burmese forces, who were more familiar with the terrain which represented \"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\", were able to push back better armed British forces made up of European and Indian soldiers. By May, Uzana's forces had overrun Cachar and Jaintia, and &lt;a href=\"Myawaddy%20Mingyi%20U%20Sa\"&gt;Lord of Myawaddy&lt;/a&gt;'s forces had defeated the British inside Bengal, causing a great panic in Calcutta.\nInstead of fighting in harsh terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May, a British naval force of over 10,000 men, led by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Archibald%20Campbell%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;Archibald Campbell&lt;/a&gt; entered the port city of &lt;a href=\"Yangon\"&gt;Yangon&lt;/a&gt;, taking the Burmese by surprise. Bagyidaw ordered Bandula and most of the troops back home to meet the enemy at Yangon. In December 1824, Bandula's 30,000 strong force tried to retake Yangon but was soundly defeated by the much better armed British forces. The British immediately went on an offensive on all fronts. By April 1825, the British had driven out the Burmese forces from Arakan, Assam, Manipur, Tenasserim, and the Irrawaddy delta where Gen. Bandula died in action. After Bandula's death, the Burmese fought on but their last-ditch effort to retake the delta was repulsed in November 1825. In February 1826, with the British army only 50 miles away from Ava, Bagyidaw agreed to British terms.\nAs per the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Yandabo\"&gt;Treaty of Yandabo&lt;/a&gt;, the British demanded and the Burmese agreed to:\nAfter the war.\nThe treaty imposed highly severe financial burden to the Burmese kingdom, and effectively left it crippled. The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved of whom 15,000 had been killed. The cost to the British India's finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China.\nFor the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long-lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battlefield. The world the Burmese knew of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of impressive military success of prior 75 years, had come crashing down. An uninvited British Resident in Ava was a daily reminder of humiliation of defeat. The burden of indemnity would leave the royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling would have been considered a colossal sum even in Europe of that time, and it became frightening when translated to Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month.\nBagyidaw could not come to terms with the loss of the territories, and the British used Tenasserim as bait for the Burmese to pay the installments of indemnity. In 1830, the British agreed to redraw the Manipuri border with Burma, giving back &lt;a href=\"Kabaw%20Valley\"&gt;Kabaw Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the Burmese. Bagyidaw delivered the balance of the indemnity at great sacrifice in November 1832. But by 1833, it was clear that the British had no intention of returning any of the territories. The king, who used to love theater and boat racing, grew increasingly reclusive, afflicted by bouts of depression. The palace power devolved to his chief queen Me Nu and her brother. In February 1837, Bagyidaw's crown prince and brother Tharrawaddy rebelled, and two months later in April, Bagyidaw was forced to abdicate. Tharrawaddy executed Me Nu and her brother, and kept his brother under house arrest. Bagyidaw died on 15 October 1846, at age 62. The former king had 23 queens, five sons and five daughters."
