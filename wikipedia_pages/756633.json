    "text": "Thomas Power O'Connor (5 October 1848 \u2013 18 November 1929), known as T. P. O'Connor and occasionally as Tay Pay (mimicking his own pronunciation of the initials \"T. P.\"), was a journalist, an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationalism\"&gt;Irish nationalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20figure\"&gt;political figure&lt;/a&gt;, and a Member of Parliament (MP) in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt; for nearly fifty years.\nEarly life and education.\nO'Connor was born in &lt;a href=\"Athlone\"&gt;Athlone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Westmeath\"&gt;County Westmeath&lt;/a&gt;, on 5 October 1848. He was the eldest son of Thomas O'Connor, an Athlone shopkeeper, and his wife Teresa Power, the daughter of a non-commissioned officer in the &lt;a href=\"Connaught%20Rangers\"&gt;Connaught Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Summerhill%20College\"&gt;College of the Immaculate Conception&lt;/a&gt; in Athlone, and &lt;a href=\"NUI%20Galway\"&gt;Queen's College Galway&lt;/a&gt;, where he won scholarships in history and modern languages and built up a reputation as an orator, serving as auditor of the college's &lt;a href=\"Literary%20and%20Debating%20Society%20%28NUI%20Galway%29\"&gt;Literary and Debating Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nO'Connor entered journalism as a junior reporter on \"Saunders' Newsletter\", a &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; journal, in 1867. In 1870, he moved to London, and was appointed a sub-editor on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\", principally on account of the utility of his mastery of French and German in reportage of the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt;. He later became London correspondent for \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Herald\"&gt;The New York Herald&lt;/a&gt;\". He compiled the society magazine \"Mainly About People\" (M.A.P.) from 1898 to 1911.\nO'Connor was elected Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Galway%20Borough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Galway Borough&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1880%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1880 general election&lt;/a&gt;, as a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Rule%20League\"&gt;Home Rule League&lt;/a&gt; (which was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shaw%20%28Irish%20politician%29\"&gt;William Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, though virtually led by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Stewart%20Parnell\"&gt;Charles Stewart Parnell&lt;/a&gt;, who would win the party's leadership a short time later). At the next &lt;a href=\"1885%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;general election in 1885&lt;/a&gt;, he was returned both for Galway and for the &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Scotland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Liverpool Scotland&lt;/a&gt; constituencies, which had a large Irish population. He chose to sit for Liverpool, and represented that constituency in the &lt;a href=\"British%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; from 1885 until his death in 1929. This was the only constituency outside the island of Ireland ever to return an Irish &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Party%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt; MP. O'Connor continued to be re-elected in Liverpool under this label unopposed in the &lt;a href=\"1918%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1918&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1922%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1923%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1924%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1929%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1929&lt;/a&gt; general elections.\nFrom 1905 he belonged to the central leadership of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Irish%20League\"&gt;United Irish League&lt;/a&gt;. During much of his time in parliament, he wrote a nightly sketch of proceedings there for the \"&lt;a href=\"Pall%20Mall%20Gazette\"&gt;Pall Mall Gazette&lt;/a&gt;\". He became \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20House\"&gt;Father of the House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;\", with unbroken service of 49 years 215 days. The Irish Nationalist Party ceased to exist effectively after the &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; landslide of 1918, and thereafter O'Connor effectively sat as an independent. On 13 April 1920, O'Connor warned the House of Commons that the death on hunger strike of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Ashe\"&gt;Thomas Ashe&lt;/a&gt; would galvanise opinion in Ireland and unite all Irishmen in opposition to British rule.\nO'Connor founded and was the first editor of several newspapers and journals: \"The Star\" (1887), the \"Weekly Sun\" (1891), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sun%20%281893%E2%80%931906%29\"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" (1893), \"M.A.P. and T.P.'s Weekly\" (1902). In August 1906 and as &lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20House\"&gt;Father of the House&lt;/a&gt;, O'Connor was instrumental in the passing by &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; of The Copyright Law for Music Act 1906, also known as the T.P. O'Connor Bill, following many of the popular music writers at the time dying in poverty due to extensive piracy by gangs during the piracy crisis of sheet music in the early 20th century. The gangs would often buy a copy of the music at full price, copy it, and resell it, often at half the price of the original. The film \"&lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Be%20Your%20Sweetheart\"&gt;I'll Be Your Sweetheart&lt;/a&gt;\" (1945), commissioned by the British &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Ministry of Information&lt;/a&gt;, is based on the events of the day.\nHe was appointed as the second president of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification\"&gt;Board of Film Censors&lt;/a&gt; in 1916 and appeared in front of the Cinema Commission of Inquiry (1916), set up by the National Council of Public Morals where he outlined the BBFC's position on protecting public morals by listing forty-three infractions, from the BBFC 1913\u20131915 reports, on why scenes in a film may be cut. He was appointed to the &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; by the first &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; government in 1924. He was also a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Chartered%20Institute%20of%20Journalists\"&gt;Chartered Institute of Journalists&lt;/a&gt;, the world's oldest journalists' organisation. It continues to honour him by having a T.P. O'Connor charity fund.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1885, O'Connor married Elizabeth Paschal, a daughter of a judge of the Supreme Court of &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nHe died in London on 18 November 1929 and is buried at &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Catholic%20Cemetery%2C%20Kensal%20Green\"&gt;St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green&lt;/a&gt; in north-west London. He was the last Father of the House to die as a sitting MP until &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Kaufman\"&gt;Sir Gerald Kaufman&lt;/a&gt; in 2017."
