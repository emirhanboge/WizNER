    "text": "The METRO Purple Line, formerly known as the Rush Line Corridor, is a proposed bus rapid transit service that would run from &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20Union%20Depot\"&gt;Union Depot&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt; to downtown White Bear Lake. Along the corridor's 21 proposed stations there are 106,000 jobs within a 10-minute walk. The project is currently in an environmental analysis phase with further development, engineering, and construction expected to take at least six more years. Service would run 7-days a week with 10-minute &lt;a href=\"headway\"&gt;headway&lt;/a&gt;s in peak periods and 15-minute service at most other times. The corridor is named the Rush Line because it was originally planned to end in &lt;a href=\"Rush%20City%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Rush City, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. After using the color purple since 2017, the route was officially named the Purple Line and became part of the &lt;a href=\"Metro%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;METRO&lt;/a&gt; network on July 14, 2021.\nPotential commuter rail.\nAt one point the project was proposed to be commuter rail all the way to &lt;a href=\"Hinckley%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Hinckley, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. The corridor studied roughly follows the path of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2061\"&gt;U.S. Route 61&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rock%20Corridor\"&gt;Red Rock Corridor&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast and the &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Corridor%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;Southwest Corridor&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis%20%E2%80%93%20Saint%20Paul\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt;, it was considered a \"Tier Two\" commuter rail project with scheduled implementation after 2020. Efforts to improve the corridor are coordinated by the Rush Line Corridor Task Force, formed in 1999 and composed of 22 elected officials from &lt;a href=\"County%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; and municipalities along the corridor.\nCommuter rail costs were expected to be high if implemented, due to the multiple &lt;a href=\"Railway%20company\"&gt;railroads&lt;/a&gt; operating the tracks, additionally some sections of rail would have to be rebuilt on county-owned abandoned &lt;a href=\"Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29\"&gt;rights-of-way&lt;/a&gt;. Existing rail is a combination of &lt;a href=\"Class%20I%20railroad\"&gt;Class I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Class%20III%20railroad\"&gt;Class III&lt;/a&gt; railroads. Despite a relatively high &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt;, projected &lt;a href=\"Patronage%20%28transportation%29\"&gt;ridership&lt;/a&gt; is lower than originally anticipated because commuters are split in their final destination, mostly downtown Saint Paul or &lt;a href=\"Central%2C%20Minneapolis\"&gt;downtown Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. If built, it could connect with the proposed &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Lights%20Express\"&gt;Northern Lights Express&lt;/a&gt; in Hinckley and provide a more direct link between Saint Paul and &lt;a href=\"Duluth%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Duluth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatives study.\nAlternatives to commuter rail were presented, including the implementation &lt;a href=\"bus%20rapid%20transit\"&gt;bus rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; throughout the corridor or &lt;a href=\"light%20rail\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; in the Ramsey County portion, from Union Depot to &lt;a href=\"White%20Bear%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;White Bear Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having significantly lower operating costs than commuter rail, light rail would require taking &lt;a href=\"lane\"&gt;lane&lt;/a&gt;s on East Seventh Street in downtown Saint Paul, additionally track right of way would run close to residential structures.\nThe Ramsey and Washington county portions of the corridor are served by &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Transit%20Routes%23Routes%20200-299\"&gt;local Metro Transit bus routes&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2009, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Council\"&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/a&gt; awarded $3.4\u00a0million to extend the existing &lt;a href=\"park%20and%20ride\"&gt;park and ride&lt;/a&gt; facilities at &lt;a href=\"Maplewood%20Mall\"&gt;Maplewood Mall&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2010, a commuter bus service is expected to begin service in the corridor. Originating from &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Forest Lake&lt;/a&gt;, the route is planning a stop in &lt;a href=\"White%20Bear%20Township%2C%20Ramsey%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;White Bear Township&lt;/a&gt; en route to multiple stops in downtown Saint Paul before terminating at Union Depot. Ridership is expected at 200 persons a day. The Rush Line Task Force and the Metropolitan Council are looking for access to county and federal funds to cover capital costs.\nA preliminary study was released in September 2015 by the Rush Line Task Force narrowing down the options to 4 types of vehicles and routes that will be considered for the project. The options include:\nA second phase of the study will be completed during Winter 2015 and Spring 2016 timeframe, according to page 5 of the Tier 1 Evaluation Results report.\nPre-Project Development and Environmental Analysis Phase.\nRamsey County approved the Locally Preferred Alternative in September 2017. The bus rapid transit project will travel the 14-miles from &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20Union%20Depot\"&gt;Saint Paul Union Depot&lt;/a&gt; to downtown White Beak Lake on 85-90% dedicated guideway. The project initially had 20 stations but at the public's request an additional station was added. The project's final station location in downtown White Bear Lake has generated controversy.\nThe project would cost between $420-470 million and could open as soon as 2026.\nThe project's &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Assessment\"&gt;Environmental Assessment&lt;/a&gt; was released in May 2021 for public comment. An end-to-end running time of roughly 45 minutes was projected. An estimated 7,400 rides were projected by 2040 with 54% of those rides being for work commutes. 70% of the 15-mile route would be on guideway dedicated to transit. The project needs to undergo further project development, final engineering, and construction before service begins in 2026. While the project is currently being developed by Ramsey County, following completion of the Environmental Assessment the project development is handed off to the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Council\"&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/a&gt; for completion and operation."
