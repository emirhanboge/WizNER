    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Lieutenant\"&gt;Lieut&lt;/a&gt;. Robert Shafto Hedley (17 January 1857 \u2013 29 January 1884) was an English soldier and &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt;. He was the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt; team that reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1878%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1878&lt;/a&gt;, where they were defeated 3\u20131 by the &lt;a href=\"Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nHedley was born in &lt;a href=\"Taunton\"&gt;Taunton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somerset\"&gt;Somerset&lt;/a&gt; and educated at &lt;a href=\"Reading%20School\"&gt;Reading School&lt;/a&gt;. At Reading, he played for the school &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; XI from 1871 to 1873, including in a match against &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in its inaugural season.\nAccording to the 1871 census, he lived with his mother, Catherine, at Easby Hall, &lt;a href=\"Easby%2C%20Richmondshire\"&gt;Easby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; in Yorkshire.\nOn leaving school, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich\"&gt;Royal Military Academy, Woolwich&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 August 1876, he was appointed as &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFootball career.\nHedley played football for the Royal Military Academy and for the Royal Engineers. A &lt;a href=\"centre-forward\"&gt;centre-forward&lt;/a&gt;, he was described as \"a useful centre, combining considerable speed and weight with no small amount of energy\", although early reports suggested that \"he should study shooting at goal\".\nIn 1878, his scoring ability helped the Royal Engineers to reach &lt;a href=\"1878%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Hat-trick%23Association%20football\"&gt;hat-tricks&lt;/a&gt; in the early rounds against the Pilgrims (won 6\u20130) and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20F.C.\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; (won 8\u20130). For the final, played at &lt;a href=\"Kennington%20Oval\"&gt;Kennington Oval&lt;/a&gt; on 23 March, Hedley was &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; for the Engineers. Wanderers won the match 3\u20131 although early in the second half, with the score 2\u20131, Hedley had a \"goal\" disallowed due to an infringement of the &lt;a href=\"Offside%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;offside&lt;/a&gt; rule.\nHis goal-scoring for the Engineers brought him to the attention of the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; selectors who named him in the squad for the international against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; on 2 March 1878, but he was not available to play. He was called up again for the Scotland international the following March, but this match was postponed because of bad weather and he was again unavailable for the re-arranged match.\nHedley was a member of &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20Association\"&gt;the Football Association&lt;/a&gt; committee in 1878\u20131879.\nMilitary career and death.\nHedley was posted to &lt;a href=\"Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; where he drowned at &lt;a href=\"Trincomalee\"&gt;Trincomalee&lt;/a&gt; on 29 January 1884, two weeks after his 27th birthday. He was out boating and landed on a rock offshore. At some point, his boat came loose and drifted away; Hedley tried to swim back to the boat, but failed to reach it. Eventually, his body was discovered by a search party who had been sent out to look for him."
