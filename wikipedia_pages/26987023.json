    "text": "Jacobus Bisschop (1658 \u2013 1697) was an 18th-century painter from the Northern Netherlands.\nBiography.\nHe was born and died in &lt;a href=\"Dordrecht\"&gt;Dordrecht&lt;/a&gt;. According to Houbraken when his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Bisschop\"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt; no longer needed him, he left for the Hague to follow lessons from &lt;a href=\"Augustinus%20Terwesten\"&gt;Augustinus Terwesten&lt;/a&gt;. After that he mostly made paintings for wall decorations in stately homes, at which pursuit he was quite successful.\nAccording to the RKD he was the son of the genre painter &lt;a href=\"Cornelis%20Bisschop\"&gt;Cornelis Bisschop&lt;/a&gt; and brother of the bird painter Abraham Busschop. He became Terwesten's pupil in 1686 at the &lt;a href=\"Confrerie%20Pictura\"&gt;Confrerie Pictura&lt;/a&gt;. He became a member of the Dordrecht &lt;a href=\"Guild%20of%20St.%20Luke\"&gt;Guild of St. Luke&lt;/a&gt;."
