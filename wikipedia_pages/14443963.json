    "text": "Two \"Ferret\"-class destroyers served with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. and were built by &lt;a href=\"Cammell%20Laird\"&gt;Laird&lt;/a&gt;, displaced 280 tons and were in overall length.\nArmament.\nThey were armed with one &lt;a href=\"QF%2012%20pounder%2012%20cwt%20naval%20gun\"&gt;12-pounder&lt;/a&gt; and three 6-pounder guns, and three torpedo tubes (two on deck mounts and one fixed bow tube). The bow tube was soon removed, and provision was made for removing the deck tubes and substituting two extra 6-pounder guns. They carried a complement of 42 (later raised to 53).\nBackground.\nThe invention of the self-propelled &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Whitehead\"&gt;Robert Whitehead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austrian Navy&lt;/a&gt; Captain &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Luppis\"&gt;Giovanni Luppis&lt;/a&gt; in 1866, combined with the introduction of small fast &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s (invented by &lt;a href=\"John%20Ericsson\"&gt;John Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century) posed a threat to &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s: large numbers of torpedo boats could overwhelm a battleship's defences and sink it, or distract the battleship and make it vulnerable to opposing capital ships. Torpedo boats proved devastatingly effective in the &lt;a href=\"1891%20Chilean%20Civil%20War\"&gt;1891 Chilean Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe defence against torpedo boats was clear: small warships accompanying the fleet that could screen and protect it from attack by torpedo boats. Several European navies developed vessels variously known as torpedo boat \"catchers\", \"hunters\" and \"destroyers\", while the Royal Navy itself operated &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20gunboat\"&gt;torpedo gunboat&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the early designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Sea%20Lord\"&gt;Third Sea Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher\"&gt;Jackie Fisher&lt;/a&gt; ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF\"&gt;quick-firing&lt;/a&gt; small calibre guns.\nOrders.\nSix ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder:\nDesign.\nThese boats all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt; that was characteristic of early British TBDs. All six of them were removed from service and disposed of by the end of 1912, and thus were not affected by the Admiralty decision in 1913 to group all the surviving 27-knot and 30-knot destroyers (which had followed on these six 26-knot vessels) into four heterogeneous classes, labelled \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" classes.\nThe \"Ferret\"-class destroyers were followed by the larger which were built by Lairds less than a year later."
