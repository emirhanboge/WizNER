    "text": "Vairas (literally: \"steering wheel\"; also translated as \"helm\" or \"rudder\") was a &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian-language\"&gt;Lithuanian-language&lt;/a&gt; political and cultural newspaper published by &lt;a href=\"Antanas%20Smetona\"&gt;Antanas Smetona&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Nationalist%20Union\"&gt;Lithuanian Nationalist Union&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling party in Lithuania in 1926\u20131940. It was published three separate times. \"Vairas\" was first established in January 1914 when Smetona departed \"&lt;a href=\"Viltis%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Viltis&lt;/a&gt;\"; it was discontinued due to World War I. The newspaper was briefly revived in September 1923 when Smetona and &lt;a href=\"Augustinas%20Voldemaras\"&gt;Augustinas Voldemaras&lt;/a&gt; harshly criticized their political opponents and the Lithuanian government. Due to anti-government rhetoric, their newspapers were closed by state censors one after another, but they would quickly establish a new newspaper under a new title. \"Vairas\" was closed in February 1924. The newspaper was reestablished as a cultural magazine in 1929 with the backing of the authoritarian regime of Smetona. In 1939, it became a weekly political magazine that pushed an agenda of radical nationalism and openly sympathized with &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialism\"&gt;National Socialism&lt;/a&gt;. The magazine was discontinued after the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Soviet occupation of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in June 1940.\n1914\u20131915.\nIt was established by Antanas Smetona with financial backing of &lt;a href=\"Martynas%20Y%C4%8Das%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Martynas Y\u010das&lt;/a&gt; on 5 January 1914 in &lt;a href=\"Vilnius\"&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;. After a conflict with conservative clergy, Smetona departed \"&lt;a href=\"Viltis%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Viltis&lt;/a&gt;\" and established \"Vairas\" to continue its original mission of uniting Lithuanians, regardless of their religious or political beliefs, and promoting the &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20National%20Revival\"&gt;Lithuanian national identity&lt;/a&gt;. Initially it was a monthly, and in 1915 became a weekly. It was frequently illustrated with reproductions of paintings and photos by Lithuanian artists, including &lt;a href=\"Mikalojus%20Konstantinas%20%C4%8Ciurlionis\"&gt;Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Kalpokas\"&gt;Petras Kalpokas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antanas%20%C5%BDmuidzinavi%C4%8Dius\"&gt;Antanas \u017dmuidzinavi\u010dius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adomas%20Varnas\"&gt;Adomas Varnas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juozas%20Zikaras\"&gt;Juozas Zikaras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Rim%C5%A1a\"&gt;Petras Rim\u0161a&lt;/a&gt;. The publication was discontinued in summer 1915 due to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. \n1923\u20131924.\n\"Vairas\" was reestablished as a weekly in &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt; in September 1923. Smetona, the first &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;President of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in April 1919 \u2013 June 1920, and &lt;a href=\"Augustinas%20Voldemaras\"&gt;Augustinas Voldemaras&lt;/a&gt;, the first Prime Minister in November\u2013December 1918, relentlessly criticized their political opponents, the Lithuanian government, and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seimas%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Second Seimas&lt;/a&gt;. Their publications were closed one after another by the government censors. Using a loophole in the law, they would establish a new publication under a slightly different name. Thus \"Lietuvos balsas\" (Voice of Lithuania; April\u2013October 1921) turned into \"Lietuvi\u0173 balsas\" (Voice of the Lithuanians; November\u2013December 1921) which became \"Tautos balsas\" (Voice of the Nation), \"T\u0117vyn\u0117s balsas\" (Voice of the Fatherland), and eventually \"Kra\u0161to balsas\" (Voice of the Country; October 1922 \u2013 June 1923). In September 1923, they revived the pre-war \"Vairas\". It was double the size of \"Kra\u0161to balsas\" and was illustrated with works by &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Rim%C5%A1a\"&gt;Petras Rim\u0161a&lt;/a&gt;, but it also did not last long. In November 1923, both Smetona and Voldemaras were imprisoned for two months for their criticism of the government. \"Vairas\" was discontinued on February 24, 1924. It was replaced by one-time publications \"Skeveldr\u0173 rinkinys\" (Collection of Fragments; February 28) and \"Irklas\" (Oar; March 7). Renamed to \"Tautos vairas\", the newspaper was published from March to fall 1924 when it was replaced by \"Lietuvis\" (The Lithuanian).\n1929\u20131940.\n\"Vairas\" was once again reestablished as a monthly magazine in 1929 in Kaunas. It became a biweekly in 1938 and weekly in 1939. The magazine was edited by Domas Cesevi\u010dius, Bronius Dirmeikis, Vladas Naus\u0117das, Izidorius Tamo\u0161aitis. The &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Nationalist%20Union\"&gt;Lithuanian Nationalist Union&lt;/a&gt; was the ruling party in Lithuania since the &lt;a href=\"1926%20Lithuanian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;December 1926 coup&lt;/a&gt; and published its official daily \"&lt;a href=\"Lietuvos%20aidas\"&gt;Lietuvos aidas&lt;/a&gt;\". Therefore, \"Vairas\" returned to its roots and published articles on issues of culture, philosophy, science, literature, etc. as well as on questions of social, political, and economic life. It also published works of fiction and their reviews. Its contributors included &lt;a href=\"Juozas%20Bal%C4%8Dikonis\"&gt;Juozas Bal\u010dikonis&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Liudas%20Gira\"&gt;Liudas Gira&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Pranas%20Ma%C5%A1iotas\"&gt;Pranas Ma\u0161iotas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balys%20Sruoga\"&gt;Balys Sruoga&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Augustinas%20Voldemaras\"&gt;Augustinas Voldemaras&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"Vairas\" became more radical in 1938\u20131939, and switched from a cultural monthly to a political monthly. A group of members of Young Lithuania, the youth organization of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, took editorial control of \"Vairas\" and became known as \"varpininkai\". The group pushed an agenda of radical nationalism. They were openly &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;anti-semitic&lt;/a&gt;, anti-democratic, anti-communist, &lt;a href=\"Totalitarianism\"&gt;totalitarian&lt;/a&gt; and sympathized with &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialism\"&gt;National Socialism&lt;/a&gt;. They believed all political parties to be a hurdle towards creating a monolithic state with an unquestioned absolute leader at the top (cf. \"&lt;a href=\"F%C3%BChrerprinzip\"&gt;F\u00fchrerprinzip&lt;/a&gt;\") and saw &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; as a \"psychosis\" which the young generation should rid itself of. For example, the magazine published articles proposing economic policies to \"review\" property of foreigners and impose special taxes or fines to employers who hired non-Lithuanians with a clear goal of diminishing the economic power of &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Jews\"&gt;Lithuanian Jews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vytautas%20Alantas\"&gt;Vytautas Alantas&lt;/a&gt; published an article in \"Vairas\" arguing in favor of an &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20cleansing\"&gt;ethnic cleansing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vilnius%20Region\"&gt;Vilnius Region&lt;/a&gt; after it was returned to Lithuania according to the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Mutual%20Assistance%20Treaty\"&gt;Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 he cited &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; as an example writing that \"the Germans turned the city of &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; into the most German city in their country through a fully mechanical process \u2013 people were moved out and other people were moved in\". The magazine was discontinued after the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Soviet occupation of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in June 1940."
