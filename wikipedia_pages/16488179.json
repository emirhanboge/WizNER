Following this brief baseball career he became a successful &lt;a href=\"mycologist\"&gt;mycologist&lt;/a&gt; who worked primarily at &lt;a href=\"Brown%20University\"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt; for the next 60 years.\nBaseball career.\nSnell was a college three-sport athlete turned scientist. Besides &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, he played &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brockton%20High%20School\"&gt;Brockton High School&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1907. He then attended &lt;a href=\"Phillips%20Andover%20Academy\"&gt;Phillips Andover Academy&lt;/a&gt; for two years, graduating in 1909, before enrolling at &lt;a href=\"Brown%20University\"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Brown, Snell was both a scholar and an athlete, as a &lt;a href=\"Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Society\"&gt;Phi Beta Kappa&lt;/a&gt; in academics and a catcher for four years on the varsity baseball team under coach &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Pattee\"&gt;Harry Pattee&lt;/a&gt;. In 1913, he was signed by the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Athletics\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt; owner &lt;a href=\"Connie%20Mack\"&gt;Connie Mack&lt;/a&gt;, but broke his hand in a game at Brown and was dealt to the Red Sox.\nIn a six-game career, Snell was a .250 hitter (3-for-12) with one &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stolen base&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href=\"run%20batted%20in\"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s. In two catching appearances, he committed one error in 13 chances accepted for a .923 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Snell hit a &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; in his first major league &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Naps\"&gt;Cleveland Naps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Cullop%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Nick Cullop&lt;/a&gt; on August 1, 1913. He was one of five catchers the Red Sox used during the &lt;a href=\"1913%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;1913 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his majors career, Snell continued to play some &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt; while studying for his master's degree, playing in 1914 and 1915 in the &lt;a href=\"International%20League\"&gt;International League&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs%20%28International%20League%29\"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; (1914) and &lt;a href=\"Rochester%20Red%20Wings\"&gt;Rochester Hustlers&lt;/a&gt; (1915), and for the &lt;a href=\"Manchester-by-the-Sea%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; team of the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20League\"&gt;New England League&lt;/a&gt; (1915), becoming a &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; in his last baseball season.\nDoctoral career.\nAfter receiving his master's degree from Brown in 1915, Snell began to pursue his doctoral studies in 1916 at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin\"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. He earned a Ph.D. degree in &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botany&lt;/a&gt; and went on to a distinguished career as a college professor and athletic coach both in baseball and football at Brown University for 39 years. In the summer of 1923, he managed the &lt;a href=\"Hyannis%20Harbor%20Hawks\"&gt;Hyannis&lt;/a&gt; town team in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Cod%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Cape Cod Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter retiring as a professor in 1959, he had written numerous professional papers on research in his field, published in scientific journals such as \"&lt;a href=\"Mycologia\"&gt;Mycologia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Phytopathology\". His research delved in areas as diverse as forest tree diseases, decay in building timbers, toxicity of &lt;a href=\"creosote\"&gt;creosote&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"wood-decay%20fungus\"&gt;wood-destroying fungi&lt;/a&gt;, language of &lt;a href=\"mycology\"&gt;mycology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"bolete\"&gt;bolete&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hydnum\"&gt;hydnum&lt;/a&gt;s (types of mushrooms and fungi).\nSnell died at the age of 91 in &lt;a href=\"Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Providence, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;."
