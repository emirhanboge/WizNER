Due to its strategic location and the navigability of the city's harbors, Sevastopol has been an important &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt; throughout its history. Since the city's founding in 1783 it has been a major base for Russia's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, and it was previously a &lt;a href=\"closed%20city\"&gt;closed city&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. As of January 2021, the city of Sevastopol, largely concentrated around &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20Bay\"&gt;Sevastopol Bay&lt;/a&gt;, had a population of 429,922, while the larger conglomerate of surrounding towns and rural communities boosts the total population of the area to 509,992.\nSevastopol, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognised as part of &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and under the Ukrainian legal framework the city enjoys &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;special status&lt;/a&gt;. However, \"de facto\" it is administered by &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;annexed Crimea&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 and regards Sevastopol as a &lt;a href=\"federal%20cities%20of%20Russia\"&gt;federal city&lt;/a&gt;. The city's population has an ethnic &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; majority, with a substantial minority of &lt;a href=\"Ukrainians\"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough relatively small at , Sevastopol's unique naval and maritime features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderate warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular &lt;a href=\"seaside%20resort\"&gt;seaside resort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourist&lt;/a&gt; destination, mainly for visitors &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;from the former Soviet republics&lt;/a&gt;. The city is also an important centre for &lt;a href=\"marine%20biology\"&gt;marine biology&lt;/a&gt; research. In particular, the military has studied and trained &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s in the city for &lt;a href=\"Military%20marine%20mammal\"&gt;military use&lt;/a&gt; since the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen in the same &lt;a href=\"etymology\"&gt;etymological&lt;/a&gt; trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, (\"&lt;a href=\"sebastos\"&gt;sebast\u00f3s&lt;/a&gt;\", ; 'venerable') and the noun (\"p\u00f3lis\", 'city'). is the traditional Greek equivalent (see &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20%28name%29\"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt;) of the Roman honorific \"&lt;a href=\"Augustus%20%28honorific%29\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;\", originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt; and later awarded as a title to his successors.\nDespite its Greek origin, the name is not from Ancient Greek times. The city was probably named after Empress (\"&lt;a href=\"Augusta%20%28honorific%29\"&gt;Augusta&lt;/a&gt;\") &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine II&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Joseph II&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.\nIn the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of &lt;a href=\"Chersonesos%20Taurica\"&gt;Chersonesos&lt;/a&gt;, founded in the 5th century BC by settlers from &lt;a href=\"Heraclea%20Pontica\"&gt;Heraclea Pontica&lt;/a&gt;. This name means \"peninsula\", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: \"Cherson\u0113sos &lt;a href=\"Taurica\"&gt;Taurik\u0113&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"the &lt;a href=\"Tauri\"&gt;Tauri&lt;/a&gt;an Peninsula\").\nThe name of the city is spelled as:\nHistory.\nAncient Chersonesus.\nIn the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of &lt;a href=\"Chersonesus%20%28Crimea%29\"&gt;Chersonesus&lt;/a&gt; existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the &lt;a href=\"Bosporan%20Kingdom\"&gt;Bosporan Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt; several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.\nPart of the Russian Empire.\nSevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar (\"White Cliff\"), by Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20MacKenzie%20%28Russian%20admiral%29\"&gt;Thomas MacKenzie&lt;/a&gt; (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scot&lt;/a&gt; in Russian service; soon after &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; annexed the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Khanate\"&gt;Crimean Khanate&lt;/a&gt;. Five years earlier, &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Suvorov\"&gt;Alexander Suvorov&lt;/a&gt; ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. In February 1784, &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine the Great&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Grigory%20Potyomkin\"&gt;Grigory Potemkin&lt;/a&gt; to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain &lt;a href=\"Fyodor%20Ushakov\"&gt;Fyodor Ushakov&lt;/a&gt; who in 1788 was named commander of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; and of the Black Sea squadron. It became an important &lt;a href=\"naval%20base\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt; and later a commercial &lt;a href=\"seaport\"&gt;seaport&lt;/a&gt;. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Paul%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Paul I&lt;/a&gt;, the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.\nOne of the most notable events involving the city is the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29\"&gt;Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt;ese, and &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; troops during the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20War\"&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians chose to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.\nA &lt;a href=\"panorama\"&gt;panorama&lt;/a&gt; of the siege originally was created by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Roubaud\"&gt;Franz Roubaud&lt;/a&gt;. After its destruction in 1942 during World War II, it was restored and is currently housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation at the height of the siege, on 18 June 1855.\nWorld War II.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941\u201342, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;Battle of Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;. German forces used &lt;a href=\"railway%20artillery\"&gt;railway artillery&lt;/a&gt;\u2014including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre \"&lt;a href=\"Schwerer%20Gustav\"&gt;Schwerer Gustav&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014and &lt;a href=\"Karl-Ger%C3%A4t\"&gt;specialised mobile heavy mortars&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Gorky%20Fortresses\"&gt;Maxim Gorky Fortresses&lt;/a&gt;. After fierce fighting, which lasted for 250 days, the fortress city finally fell to Axis forces in July 1942. It was intended to be renamed to \"Theodorichshafen\" (in reference to &lt;a href=\"Theodoric%20the%20Great\"&gt;Theodoric the Great&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that the Crimea had been home to Germanic &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt; until the 18th or 19th century) in the event of a German victory against the Soviet Union, and like the rest of the Crimea was designated for future colonisation by the Third Reich. It was liberated by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20City\"&gt;Hero City&lt;/a&gt; title a year later.\nPart of Ukrainian SSR.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; era, Sevastopol became a so-called \"&lt;a href=\"closed%20city\"&gt;closed city&lt;/a&gt;\". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.\nOn 29 October 1948, the Presidium of Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued an \"ukas\" (order) which confirmed the special status of the city. Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Soviet%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\", indicated that Sevastopol, &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Oblast\"&gt;Crimean Oblast&lt;/a&gt; was part of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20SSR\"&gt;Ukrainian SSR&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1954, under &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;, both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively &lt;a href=\"1954%20transfer%20of%20Crimea\"&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR. Administratively, Sevastopol was a municipality excluded from the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Oblast\"&gt;Crimean Oblast&lt;/a&gt;. The territory of the municipality was 863.5\u00a0km2 and it was further subdivided into four raions (districts). Besides the City of Sevastopol proper, it also included two towns\u2014Balaklava (having had no status until 1957), Inkerman, urban-type settlement Kacha, and 29 villages.\nAt the 1955 Ukrainian parliamentary elections on 27 February, Sevastopol was split into two electoral districts, Stalinsky and Korabelny (initially requested three Stalinsky, Korabelny, and Nakhimovsky). Eventually, Sevastopol received two &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Deputy%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;people's deputies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20SSR\"&gt;Ukrainian SSR&lt;/a&gt; elected to the &lt;a href=\"Verkhovna%20Rada\"&gt;Verkhovna Rada&lt;/a&gt; A. Korovchenko and M. Kulakov.\nIn 1957, the town of &lt;a href=\"Balaklava\"&gt;Balaklava&lt;/a&gt; was incorporated into Sevastopol.\nPart of Ukraine.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;'s independence, Sevastopol became the principal base of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20navy\"&gt;Ukrainian navy&lt;/a&gt;. As the key naval base of the former Soviet &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, it was a source of tensions for &lt;a href=\"Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine%20relations\"&gt;Russia\u2013Ukraine relations&lt;/a&gt; until a &lt;a href=\"Partition%20Treaty%20on%20the%20Status%20and%20Conditions%20of%20the%20Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;temporary lease agreement&lt;/a&gt; was reached.\nOn 10 July 1993, the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20parliament\"&gt;Russian parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed a resolution declaring Sevastopol to be \"a federal Russian city\". At the time, many supporters of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Russia\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Yeltsin\"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt;, had ceased taking part in the Parliament's work. On 20 July 1993 the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; denounced the decision of the Russia parliament. According to &lt;a href=\"Anatoliy%20Zlenko\"&gt;Anatoliy Zlenko&lt;/a&gt;, it was for the first time that the council had to review actions and come up with qualification of them for a legislative body.\nOn 14 April 1993, the Presidium of the Crimean Parliament called for the creation of the presidential post of the Crimean Republic. A week later, the Russian deputy, Valentin Agafonov, stated that Russia was ready to supervise the referendum on Crimean independence and include the republic as a separate entity in the CIS. On 28 July 1993, one of the leaders of the Russian Society of Crimea, Viktor Prusakov, stated that his organisation was ready for an armed mutiny and establishment of the Russian administration in Sevastopol.\nIn September, the commander of the joint Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet, , accused Ukraine of converting some of his fleet and conducting an armed assault on his personnel, and threatened to take countermeasures of placing the fleet on alert. (In June 1992, the Russian president &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Yeltsin\"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt; and the Ukrainian president &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Kravchuk\"&gt;Leonid Kravchuk&lt;/a&gt; had agreed to divide the former-Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine. Eduard Baltin had been appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet by Yeltsin and Kravchuk on 15 January 1993.)\nIn May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the &lt;a href=\"Russian%E2%80%93Ukrainian%20Friendship%20Treaty\"&gt;Peace and Friendship Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine. On 28 May 1997, was followed by the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20Treaty%20on%20the%20Status%20and%20Conditions%20of%20the%20Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. A separate agreement established the terms of a long-term lease of land, facilities, and resources in Sevastopol and the Crimea by Russia. Russia kept its naval base, with around 15,000 troops stationed in Sevastopol.\nThe ex-Soviet &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt; and its facilities were divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Navy\"&gt;Ukrainian Naval Forces&lt;/a&gt;. The two navies co-used some of the city's harbours and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either country. Sevastopol remained the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters with the Ukrainian Naval Forces Headquarters also in the city. A judicial row periodically continued over the naval &lt;a href=\"hydrography\"&gt;hydrographic&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially &lt;a href=\"lighthouses\"&gt;lighthouses&lt;/a&gt; historically maintained by the Soviet or Russian Navy and also used for civil navigation support).\nAs in the rest of the Crimea, Russian remained the predominant language of the city, although following the independence of Ukraine there were some attempts at &lt;a href=\"Ukrainisation\"&gt;Ukrainisation&lt;/a&gt; with very little success. The Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and tended to regard it as temporarily separated from the homeland.\nIn July 2009, the chairman of the Sevastopol city council, Valeriy Saratov (&lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Regions\"&gt;Party of Regions&lt;/a&gt;) stated that Ukraine should increase the amount of compensation it is paying to the city of Sevastopol for hosting the foreign &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, instead of requesting such obligations from the Russian government and the Russian Ministry of Defense in particular.\nOn 27 April 2010, Russia and Ukraine ratified the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Ukrainian%20Naval%20Base%20for%20Gas%20treaty\"&gt;Russian Ukrainian Naval Base for Gas treaty&lt;/a&gt;, extending the Russian Navy's lease of Crimean facilities for 25 years after 2017 (through 2042) with an option to prolong the lease in five-year extensions. The ratification process in the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20parliament\"&gt;Ukrainian parliament&lt;/a&gt; encountered stiff opposition and erupted into a brawl in the parliament chamber. Eventually, the treaty was ratified by a 52% majority vote\u2014236 of 450. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Duma\"&gt;Russian Duma&lt;/a&gt; ratified the treaty by a 98% majority (without incident).\nAnnexation by Russia.\nOn 23 February 2014, a large pro-Russian rally took place in Nakhimov Square declaring allegiance to Russia and protesting against the new government in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Ukrainian%20revolution\"&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of the president, &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Yanukovych\"&gt;Viktor Yanukovych&lt;/a&gt;. On 27 February, pro-Russian gunmen, including Russian troops, seized control of government buildings in Crimea, and by 28 February, controlled other strategic locations such as the military airport in Sevastopol.\nOn 16 March 2014, a &lt;a href=\"2014%20Crimean%20status%20referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; was held in Sevastopol with official results indicating a 89.51% turnout and 95.6% of voters choosing to join Russia. On 18 March, &lt;a href=\"Annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;Russia formally annexed Crimea&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Crimea\"&gt;Republic of Crimea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20cities%20of%20Russia\"&gt;federal city&lt;/a&gt; of Sevastopol as &lt;a href=\"federal%20subjects%20of%20Russia\"&gt;federal subjects of Russia&lt;/a&gt;. However, the annexation remains internationally unrecognized, with most countries recognizing Sevastopol as a &lt;a href=\"city%20with%20special%20status\"&gt;city with special status&lt;/a&gt; within Ukraine.\nGeography.\nThe city of Sevastopol is located at the southwestern tip of the Crimean peninsula in a headland known as &lt;a href=\"Heracles%20peninsula\"&gt;Heracles peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on a coast of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly at the western portion of the region and around the long &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;Bay of Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;. This bay is a &lt;a href=\"ria\"&gt;ria&lt;/a&gt;, a river canyon drowned by &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt; sea-level rise, and the outlet of &lt;a href=\"Chorna%20River%20%28Crimea%29\"&gt;Chorna River&lt;/a&gt;. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of &lt;a href=\"Balaklava\"&gt;Balaklava&lt;/a&gt; (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in Soviet times served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.\nThe coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are the Southern Bay (within Bay of Sevastopol), the Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of the Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, the Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.\nThrough the region flow three rivers: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20mountains\"&gt;Crimean mountains&lt;/a&gt; are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).\nClimate.\nSevastopol has a &lt;a href=\"semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"BSk\"), closely bordering on a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the summer mean straddling it is also bordering on a four-season &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt;, with cool winters and warm to hot summers.\nThe average yearly temperature is during the day and around at night. In the coldest months, January and February, the average temperature is during the day and around at night. In the warmest months, July and August, the average temperature is around during the day and around at night. Generally, summer/holiday season lasts 5 months, from around mid-May and into September, with the temperature often reaching or more in the first half of October.\nThe average annual temperature of the sea is , ranging from in February to in August. From June to September, the average sea temperature is greater than . In the second half of May and first half of October; the average sea temperature is about . The average rainfall is about per year. There are about 2,345 hours of sunshine duration per year.\nPolitics and government.\nOn 18 March 2014, Russia &lt;a href=\"Annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;formally annexed Crimea&lt;/a&gt; with Sevastopol \"de facto\" becoming the third &lt;a href=\"Federal%20cities%20of%20Russia\"&gt;federal city&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, the two others being &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nExecutive.\nUntil 2014, executive power in Sevastopol was exercised by the &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20City%20State%20Administration\"&gt;Sevastopol City State Administration&lt;/a&gt;, led by a chairman (also known as mayor) appointed by the Ukrainian president. Since 2014, executive power is exercised by the Government of Sevastopol. The head of the executive branch in the city is the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Sevastopol%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Governor of Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;. According the city charter, amended on 29 November 2016, the governor is elected in a direct election for a term of five years and no more than two consecutive terms.\nLegislature.\nUntil 2014, the &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20City%20Council\"&gt;Sevastopol City Council&lt;/a&gt; was the legislature of Sevastopol. However, during the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Crimean%20crisis\"&gt;2014 Crimean crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the pro-Russian City Council threw its support behind Russian citizen &lt;a href=\"Alexei%20Chaly\"&gt;Alexei Chaly&lt;/a&gt; as the \"people's mayor\" and said it would not recognise orders from &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;. After Russia annexed Crimea, the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt; replaced the City Council.\nAdministrative and municipal divisions.\nSevastopol is administratively divided into four districts.\nWithin the Russian &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions\"&gt;municipal framework&lt;/a&gt;, the territory of the federal city of Sevastopol is divided into nine &lt;a href=\"okrug%23Russian%20Federation\"&gt;municipal okrugs&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Inkerman\"&gt;Inkerman&lt;/a&gt;. While individual municipal divisions are contained within the borders of the administrative districts, they are not otherwise related to the administrative districts.\nEconomy.\nApart from navy-related civil facilities, Sevastopol hosts some other notable industries. An example is Stroitel, one of the leading &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; manufacturers in Russia.\nThe city received millions of US Dollars in compensation for hosting the Russian Black Sea Fleet from the Russian and the Ukrainian government.\nInfrastructure.\nThere are different types of transport in Sevastopol:\n&lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20Shipyard\"&gt;Sevastopol Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; comprises three facilities that together repair, modernise, and re-equip Russian Naval ships and submarines. The &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Sevastopol International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is used as a military aerodrome at the moment and being reconstructed to be used by international airlines.\nSevastopol maintains a large port facility in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Sevastopol\"&gt;Bay of Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt; and in smaller bays around the &lt;a href=\"Heracles%20peninsula\"&gt;Heracles peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The port handles traffic from passengers (local transportation and cruise), cargo, and commercial fishing. The port infrastructure is fully integrated with the city of Sevastopol and naval bases of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;Black Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nTourism.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Sevastopol was entirely rebuilt. Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th century (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its Marine Boulevard.\nDue to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes. There are hundreds of monuments and plaques in various parts of Sevastopol commemorating its military past.\nAttractions include:\nDemographics.\nThe population of Sevastopol proper is 429,922 (2021), making it the largest city of the &lt;a href=\"Crimean%20Peninsula\"&gt;Crimean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.
