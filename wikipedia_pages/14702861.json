The coup plotters released him and reinstated his rank.\nEarly life.\nQu\u1ed1c was born on October 20, 1935 in Da Nang in a well-to-do family. According to genealogy, he is a descendant of a minister of the reign of &lt;a href=\"T%E1%BB%B1%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c\"&gt;T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth emperor of &lt;a href=\"Nguyen%20dynasty\"&gt;Nguyen dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a child, he attended primary school in Da Nang. When he went to high school, his family sent him back to &lt;a href=\"Saigon\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt; to study at Chasseloup- Laubat Public School. His passion for aviation developed when he was a student. He used the pocket money provided by his family to buy technical books on how to build small planes from France. He assembled and flew model airplanes at &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Son%20Nhat%20Airport\"&gt;Tan Son Nhat Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1954, he graduated from high school with a full &lt;a href=\"Baccalaur%C3%A9at\"&gt;Baccalaur\u00e9at&lt;/a&gt;. After that, his family planned to let him go to France to continue his education, but because he was so interested in airplanes, he asked his parents to let him join the military.\nMilitary career.\nOn June 15, 1954, he volunteered to join the Air Force. He was sent to train at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Air%20Force\"&gt;French Air Force&lt;/a&gt; Officer Training School in &lt;a href=\"Marrakech%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Marrakech, Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. In early April 1955, he finished his graduation with the rank of &lt;a href=\"first%20lieutenant\"&gt;first lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. Returning to &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, he served in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20National%20Army\"&gt;Vietnamese National Army&lt;/a&gt; and was stationed at Bien Hoa Air Base.\nIn November 1957, after more than a year serving in the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Army of the Republic of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. In early 1961, he was sent to study in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, to learn and fly the new generation aircraft of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; for six months.

As a result, on February 27, 1962, Qu\u1ed1c and his wingmate &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20C%E1%BB%AD\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n C\u1eed&lt;/a&gt;, who were flying &lt;a href=\"A-1%20Skyraider\"&gt;A-1 Skyraider&lt;/a&gt;s, turned away from their routine military operation and headed to Saigon, where they bombed the Independence Palace, which resulted in the knocking down a corner of the palace. However, President Diem and his family managed to escape death. Qu\u1ed1c's plane was hit by the anti-aircraft fire over &lt;a href=\"B%E1%BA%A1ch%20%C4%90%E1%BA%B1ng%20River\"&gt;B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River&lt;/a&gt; and he was forced to land on the &lt;a href=\"Saigon%20River\"&gt;Saigon River&lt;/a&gt;, near a security post in the &lt;a href=\"Nha%20Be\"&gt;Nha Be&lt;/a&gt; gas depot.

As a result, Qu\u1ed1c was released from prison and his rank restored. At the beginning of December, he was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28military%20rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;. After that, he was sent to study at the Air Ground Operation School in &lt;a href=\"Okinawa%2C%20Japan\"&gt;Okinawa, Japan&lt;/a&gt; for a period of six months.\nAt the beginning of February 1964, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, holding the position of Deputy Commander of 514th Fighter Squadron under the 23rd Air Wing.

After completing the mission on the way back, his squadron encountered enemy air defenses. His plane was shot down and it crashed in the sky of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh, resulting in his death.\nA memorial service for him was held by the South Vietnamese Air Force Command and the 23rd Tactical Air Force Command. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;. Qu\u1ed1c was also posthumously awarded the &lt;a href=\"National%20Order%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;National Order of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, 5th class and &lt;a href=\"Gallantry%20Cross%20%28Vietnam%29\"&gt;Gallantry Cross&lt;/a&gt;. His remains were initially buried by local people. It was not until 1997 that his body was brought back from H\u00e0 T\u0129nh by his biological sister, and reburied in &lt;a href=\"Hoi%20An\"&gt;Hoi An&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe popular songwriter &lt;a href=\"Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20Duy\"&gt;Ph\u1ea1m Duy&lt;/a&gt; wrote a song to eulogize him, named \"Huy\u1ec1n S\u1eed Ca M\u1ed9t Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Mang T\u00ean Qu\u1ed1c\" (\"Epic of a Man Named Qu\u1ed1c\").\nPersonal life.\nOn the day he died in battle, Qu\u1ed1c's wife was 3 months pregnant with their first son.
