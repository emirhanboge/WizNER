    "text": "The black-striped wallaby (\"Notamacropus dorsalis\"), also known as the scrub wallaby or eastern brush wallaby, is a medium-sized &lt;a href=\"wallaby\"&gt;wallaby&lt;/a&gt; found in Australia, from &lt;a href=\"Townsville%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Townsville&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Narrabri\"&gt;Narrabri&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. In New South Wales, it is only found west of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Dividing Range&lt;/a&gt;. It is decreasing in these areas, but is not classified as threatened as a species yet. The New South Wales population, however, is classified as &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe black-striped wallaby resembles the mainland Australian subspecies of the &lt;a href=\"red-necked%20wallaby\"&gt;red-necked wallaby&lt;/a&gt;, differing in the black line down its back, a white stripe over the hip and more red colouration (extending down the arms and further down the abdomen). It is a shy, &lt;a href=\"nocturnal\"&gt;nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; grazer and is not well-known, owing to its preference for thick scrub, where it may easily be hidden."
