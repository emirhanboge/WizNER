    "text": "The Stevens-Haustgen House in &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20and%20Science%20Park\"&gt;Heritage and Science Park&lt;/a&gt; is a set of two &lt;a href=\"historic%20house\"&gt;historic house&lt;/a&gt;s in Phoenix, Arizona that currently operate as the Heritage Gallery, a home for rotating art exhibits. The land on which the house sits today was originally owned by the &lt;a href=\"Rosson%20House\"&gt;Rosson Family&lt;/a&gt;, who sold the lots (604, 614 E. Adams Street) to Mary Hughes, who did not build on the property but subsequently sold the properties to Constance Stevens, from whom the house takes part of its name. \nThe house is &lt;a href=\"California%20bungalow\"&gt;California bungalow&lt;/a&gt; style was built in 1901 and operated by &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Stevens\"&gt;Constance Stevens&lt;/a&gt; as a rental property. In 1911, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Haustgen\"&gt;Edward Haustgen&lt;/a&gt; purchased it for his sisters who arrived from Luxembourg in 1914, and Marguerite Haustgen lived there from 1937 to 1952, leading to the property's hyphenated name. The house was restored in the 1970s as part of the broader restoration of what was then known as Heritage Square.\nThe House was formerly the home of the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Doll%20%26amp%3B%20Toy%20Museum\"&gt;Arizona Doll &amp; Toy Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which subsequently relocated to Glendale."
