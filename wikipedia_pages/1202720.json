    "text": "The Second Hughes Ministry (&lt;a href=\"National%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;National Labor&lt;/a&gt;) was the 12th &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Australian%20ministries\"&gt;ministry&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Government of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It was led by the country's 7th &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Hughes\"&gt;Billy Hughes&lt;/a&gt;. The Second Hughes Ministry succeeded the &lt;a href=\"First%20Hughes%20Ministry\"&gt;First Hughes Ministry&lt;/a&gt;, which dissolved on 14 November 1916 following the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party%20split%20of%201916\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; that took place within the governing &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I%20conscription%20in%20Australia\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;. This led to Hughes and his supporters leaving the party to form the National Labor Party, which swiftly received parliamentary support from &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Cook\"&gt;Joseph Cook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Commonwealth Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;. The ministry was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Hughes%20Ministry\"&gt;Third Hughes Ministry&lt;/a&gt; on 17 February 1917 after National Labor and Commonwealth Liberal merged into the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Billy%20Hughes\"&gt;Billy Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 1952, was the last surviving member of the Second Hughes Ministry; Hughes was also the last surviving member of the &lt;a href=\"Watson%20Ministry\"&gt;Watson Ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Fisher%20Ministry\"&gt;First Fisher Ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Third%20Fisher%20Ministry\"&gt;Third Fisher Ministry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20Hughes%20Ministry\"&gt;Third Hughes Ministry&lt;/a&gt;."
