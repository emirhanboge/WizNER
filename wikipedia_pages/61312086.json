    "text": "Casimiro Abdon Irala Arguello, &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;SJ&lt;/a&gt;, known as Padre Irala (4 March 1936), is a Paraguayan-born &lt;a href=\"Brazilians\"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; Jesuit &lt;a href=\"Priesthood%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, writer, musician and songwriter.\nBiography.\nHis father was a musician and taught him the first notes to the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Don Abd\u00f3n Irala, composed the first &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; sung in &lt;a href=\"Guarani%20language\"&gt;Guarani&lt;/a&gt;, in the decade of 1960. Casimiro participated early in the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, having been a participant in &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Action\"&gt;Catholic Action&lt;/a&gt;. He entered in the Society of Jesus to be a Jesuit at the age of 20, in 1956, leaving his engineering career. He studied theology in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Leopoldo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Leopoldo&lt;/a&gt;, Rio Grande do Sul, being ordained priest at age 33, on 14 December 1968 in &lt;a href=\"Asunci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Asunci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, Paraguay. On 27 December 2018, Irala celebrated the Golden Jubilee in the Capela Santo In\u00e1cio, located in the Ant\u00f4nio Vieira College.\nCareer.\nIrala is the author of one of the most consecrated songs in the Catholic medium, the &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Saint%20Francis\"&gt;Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi&lt;/a&gt; present in the vinyl compact of four songs \"Irala Canta\" (May 1968). In 2008 Father Irala re-recorded the famous song at an OPA event. The song \"Prayer of San Francisco\", was used in the novel of &lt;a href=\"Rede%20Globo\"&gt;Rede Globo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velho%20Chico\"&gt;Velho Chico&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign 'In whose name, San Francisco?' used the same song with a musical arrangement of Tim Rescala. In 1989, the song was re-recorded by &lt;a href=\"Raimundo%20Fagner\"&gt;Fagner&lt;/a&gt; on the album O Quinze, and in 2003, it appeared in an acoustic version in &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Carolina\"&gt;Ana Carolina&lt;/a&gt;'s voice on the DVD Estampado. In 2013, the song was re-recorded for the official soundtrack of &lt;a href=\"World%20Youth%20Day%202013\"&gt;WYD 2013&lt;/a&gt;, in the Heart of the Journey, being interpreted by Adriana Arydes, Eliana Ribeiro, &lt;a href=\"Guilherme%20de%20S%C3%A1\"&gt;Guilherme de S\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, Sister Kelly Patr\u00edcia, Father &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A1bio%20de%20Melo\"&gt;F\u00e1bio de Melo&lt;/a&gt; and Father &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Rossi\"&gt;Marcelo Rossi&lt;/a&gt;. Still in 2013, an instrumental version was released by the OPA Group.\nHe worked with Father &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Rahm\"&gt;Harold Rahm&lt;/a&gt; of the Christian Leadership Training (TLC) and founded the TLC Musical (TLM) in 1970, a group linked to TLC that also expanded and became the OPA - Prayer for Art in 1976. Among the people who passed the OPA are the singers &lt;a href=\"Daniela%20Mercury\"&gt;Daniela Mercury&lt;/a&gt; and Ana Paula Bouzas and the emeritus Bishop G\u00edlio Fel\u00edcio."
