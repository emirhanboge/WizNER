    "text": "The history of the Hungary national football team dates back to their first international appearance in 1912.\nHistory.\nAlthough Austria and Hungary were constituent countries of the dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they formed separate &lt;a href=\"football%20association\"&gt;football association&lt;/a&gt;s and teams around the start of the 20th century.\n1910s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary national football team&lt;/a&gt; first appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1912%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1912&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. The team had to ask for donations in order to be able to go to the games. Hungary played with &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and lost 7\u20130 and thus were eliminated.\nAfter the Olympic Games Hungary played two matches against &lt;a href=\"Russia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. The first match was won by 9\u20130 while the second 12\u20130 which is still a record of the national side. The top scorer of the two matches was &lt;a href=\"Imre%20Schlosser\"&gt;Imre Schlosser&lt;/a&gt; who scored seven goals. The beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; had a deep impact on the thriving Hungarian football. Not only was the country suffering financial problems but the clubs were too. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; Hungary played &lt;a href=\"Austria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; 16 times. In 1919 England claimed the exclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt; (including Hungary) from &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;. Since FIFA refused England's plea, the British and the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; associations (&lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scottish%20FA\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt;) decided to resign from FIFA.\n1920s.\nBudapest was denied the opportunity to host the Summer Olympics in 1920, therefore it was held in &lt;a href=\"1920%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the countries of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt; (Germany, &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;) were excluded from the Olympics. During this period the Fogl brothers (&lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Fogl\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Fogl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1roly%20Fogl\"&gt;K\u00e1roly Fogl&lt;/a&gt;) played in the national team. The formation the Hungarians used was 2\u20133\u20135 which was unique at that time. In 1924 the national team played at the &lt;a href=\"1924%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, France. In the first match Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; but in the second round they lost to &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. As a consequence, both the head coach and the head of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Hungarian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; resigned.\nBetween 1927 and 1930 Hungary participated in the Europa Cup, which is considered as the first international tournament, with &lt;a href=\"Austria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. In the final Hungary lost to Russia.\nOn 12 June 1927 Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; by 13\u20131 which is still a record. &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Tak%C3%A1cs\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Tak\u00e1cs&lt;/a&gt; scored six goals against France.\n1930s.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;. Hungary did not take part in the tournament since they were not invited and there were no qualification matches. Therefore, Hungary first appeared in the World Cup in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1934 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held. Hungary's first World Cup match was played against &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; on 27 May 1934, in the end the match was won 4\u20132. The goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1l%20Teleki\"&gt;Teleki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9za%20Toldi\"&gt;Toldi&lt;/a&gt; (2) and &lt;a href=\"Jen%C5%91%20Vincze\"&gt;Vincze&lt;/a&gt;. In the quarter-finals Hungary faced neighbouring arch-rivals &lt;a href=\"Austria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and lost 2\u20131. The only Hungarian goal was scored by &lt;a href=\"Gy%C3%B6rgy%20S%C3%A1rosi\"&gt;S\u00e1rosi&lt;/a&gt;.\nHungary entered the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1936 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. In the first round they were eliminated by Poland 0 \u2013 3.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1938 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in France. The first match was played against &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; and Hungary won 6\u20130. S\u00e1rosi and &lt;a href=\"Gyula%20Zsengell%C3%A9r\"&gt;Zsengell\u00e9r&lt;/a&gt; scored twice while &lt;a href=\"Vilmos%20Kohut\"&gt;Kohut&lt;/a&gt; and Toldi also scored a goal each. In the quarter-finals Hungary played with &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and the match was won 2\u20130 thanks to a goal by S\u00e1rosi and Zsengell\u00e9r each. The semi-finals at the &lt;a href=\"Parc%20des%20Princes\"&gt;Parc des Princes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; Hungary played against &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and won 5\u20131. &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Sas\"&gt;Sas&lt;/a&gt;, S\u00e1rosi and Zsengell\u00e9r's &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; sent them to the &lt;a href=\"1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1938 FIFA World Cup final&lt;/a&gt;. In the final Hungary faced &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Olympique%20de%20Colombes\"&gt;Stade Olympique de Colombes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The final result was 4\u20132 to Italy. The Hungarian goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1l%20Titkos\"&gt;Titkos&lt;/a&gt; and S\u00e1rosi.\n1950s.\nThis Hungarian team was best known for being one of the most formidable and influential sides in football history, which revolutionized the play of the game. Centred around the dynamic and potent quartet of strikers &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s\"&gt;Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1ndor%20Kocsis\"&gt;S\u00e1ndor Kocsis&lt;/a&gt;, attacking half-back &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Bozsik\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Bozsik&lt;/a&gt; and withdrawn striker &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A1ndor%20Hidegkuti\"&gt;N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Aranycsapat\"&gt;Aranycsapat&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Golden Team\") of the \"&lt;a href=\"Magnificent%20Magyars\"&gt;Magnificent Magyars&lt;/a&gt;\", captivated the football world with an exciting brand of play drawn from new tactical nuances and amassed, barring the &lt;a href=\"1954%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1954 World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, a remarkable record of 43 victories, 6 ties, and no defeats from 14 May 1950 until they lost 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; on 19 February 1956.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201952%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1952 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; that was held in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, Hungary beat Romania 2 \u2013 1 thanks to a goal each from Czibor and Kocsis in the Preliminary Round. In the first round Hungary won 3 \u2013 0 against Italy. In the quarter-finals Hungary beat Turkey easily 7 \u2013 1. In the semi-finals Hungary faced Sweden, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201948%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1948 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; champions and Hungary won 6 \u2013 0. In the final Hungary beat Yugoslavia 2 \u2013 0 by a goal each from Pusk\u00e1s and Czibor and thus won the Olympic title for the first time.\nOn 25 November 1953 a match took place between &lt;a href=\"England%20v%20Hungary%20%281953%29\"&gt;England and Hungary&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England, which would later be dubbed \"the match of the century\". The English team were unbeaten for 90 years at home. In front of 105,000 spectators &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A1ndor%20Hidegkuti\"&gt;N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti&lt;/a&gt; scored the first Hungarian goal in the first minute. In the first half the result was 4\u20132 to Hungary. The Hungarian goals were scored by N\u00e1ndor Hidegk\u00fati (1st, 22nd) and &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s\"&gt;Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt; (25th 29th). In the second half the Hungarians scored twice (Hidegk\u00fati and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Bozsik\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Bozsik&lt;/a&gt;) which resulted in the most important victory of the Hungarians in the twentieth century. The final result was 6\u20133.\nOn 23 May 1954 the Hungarian national team beat &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; by 7\u20131, which remains their worst defeat to date, at the Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadium. At that time in Hungary there was a saying about the match which is the following: \"Az angolok egy h\u00e9tre j\u00f6ttek \u00e9s 7:1-re mentek\" in English: The English came for a (one) week (seven days) and went home with seven (7) one (1) (the result of the match).\nThe &lt;a href=\"1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1954 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. The first match was played against &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and Hungary won by 9\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"Hardturm\"&gt;Hardturm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;. In the second group match Hungary played against &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; and won the match by 8\u20133 at the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Jakob%20Stadium\"&gt;St. Jakob Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Basel\"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;. In the quarter-finals Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20132 at the &lt;a href=\"Wankdorf%20Stadium\"&gt;Wankdorf Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt;. In the semi-finals Hungary played with the two-times World Cup winner &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;. Hungary won by 4\u20132 after extra time. In the final Hungary faced with West Germany again. Although Hungary won the group match against the Germans, they lost 3\u20132 in the final in Bern at the Wankdorf Stadium. The Golden Team, built around the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s\"&gt;Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt;, led early 2\u20130, but ended up 2\u20133 in a game the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; subsequently christened \"&lt;a href=\"1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;The Miracle of Bern&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2010 Journalist Erik Eggers speculates in a study that the Germany team may have used drugs to beat the Hungarian team, which were considered invincible at that time.\nAlthough Hungary is qualified as the defending champions for &lt;a href=\"Association%20football%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1956 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, they did not enter the tournament.\nHungary qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1958 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; which was held in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. Hungary played their first match against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Jarnvallen\"&gt;Jarnvallen&lt;/a&gt; stadium in &lt;a href=\"Sandviken\"&gt;Sandviken&lt;/a&gt; and the final result was 1\u20131. The second group match was played against the host country, Sweden. Hungary lost 2\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A5sunda%20Stadium\"&gt;R\u00e5sunda Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solna%20Municipality\"&gt;Solna&lt;/a&gt;. Although Hungary won their last group match against &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; at the Jarnvallen stadium in Sandvinken, they were eliminated from the World Cup after losing a play-off to Wales, who they had drawn level with on points. The Welsh had managed to draw all the group games and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match to decide which nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through, as the Hungarians had a goal ratio 6\u20133 compared to 2\u20132 of Wales. As it was, Wales instead meet Brazil in the quarterfinals and became the recipient of young Pel\u00e9's first World Cup goal.\n1960s.\nIn 1960 Hungary again entered the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt; held in Italy and was drawn into Group D with France, Peru and India. Hungary finished top of the group with all wins and a goal difference of +12. In the Semi-finals they lost to Denmark 0 \u2013 2, but beat Italy in the Bronze medal match 2 \u2013 1 thanks to a goal each from Orosz and Dunai and thus won a bronze medal.\nHungary qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1962 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; which was held in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. On 31 May 1962 in the first group match Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; by 2\u20131 thanks to the goals of &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20Tichy\"&gt;Tichy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%B3ri%C3%A1n%20Albert%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"El%20Teniente\"&gt;El Teniente&lt;/a&gt; stadium in &lt;a href=\"Rancagua\"&gt;Rancagua&lt;/a&gt; in front of 7938 spectators. The second match on 3 June 1962 was even more convincing against the &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; national side. The match was won by 6\u20131 in Rancagua. The last group match was against &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; on 6 June 1962 and the final result was a goalless draw in front of 7945 spectators in Rancagua. Hungary qualified for the quarter-finals by gaining 5 points and winning the group. In the quarter-finals of the World Cup Hungary was eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; by 1\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"El%20Teniente\"&gt;El Teniente&lt;/a&gt; stadium in &lt;a href=\"Rancagua\"&gt;Rancagua&lt;/a&gt; in front of 11690 spectators.\nIn 1964 Hungary again qualified for the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201964%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1964 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; held in Tokyo and was drawn into Group B with defending champions Yugoslavia, Morocco and North Korea, who withdrew. In their first match against Morocco Hungary won 6 \u2013 0 with all 6 goals scored by &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Bene\"&gt;Ferenc Bene&lt;/a&gt;. In their second match Hungary won narrowly with a 6 \u2013 5 against Yugoslavia and advanced into the next round along with runners-up Yugoslavia. In the Quarter-finals Hungary beat Romania 2 \u2013 0 with goals from Csernai. In the Semi-finals Hungary beat United Arab Republic (Egypt) 6 \u2013 0 with 4 goals from Bene and 2 from Komora.

In the finals they beat Bulgaria 4 \u2013 1 and won their third title, being the most successful team at the Olympics in football (Great Britain also won 3 titles but their first title is in 1904, and football became an official event in 1908).\n&lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%B3ri%C3%A1n%20Albert%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Albert&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"European%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;European Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 1967. He was the most successful footballer of Ferencv\u00e1ros since the formation of the club, scoring 255 goals in 351 matches from 1958 to 1974.\n1970s.\nHungary came back again as long-time defending champions in the &lt;a href=\"football%20at%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1972 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Munich and was drawn into Group C with Denmark, Iran and Brazil.

Hungary finished fourth in the 1972 UEFA Euro.\nHungary participated in the &lt;a href=\"1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1978 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; which was held in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 June 1978 at the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Monumental%20Antonio%20Vespucio%20Liberti\"&gt;Estadio Monumental&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; Hungary played with Argentina. Although &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1roly%20Csap%C3%B3\"&gt;K\u00e1roly Csap\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; scored an early goal, the home side won the match by 2\u20131. Hungary played their second group match against &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and the Azzurri won by 3\u20131. Hungary's third match was played against &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Platini\"&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/a&gt;'s France and Hungary lost 3\u20131 which resulted the farewell of the national side.\n1980s.\nDuring the 1980s Hungary qualified for the FIFA World Cup twice. The first group match of the &lt;a href=\"1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1982 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Spain was played against &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; and Hungary won by 10\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Manuel%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Valero\"&gt;Estadio Nuevo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elche\"&gt;Elche&lt;/a&gt;. The goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"Tibor%20Nyilasi\"&gt;Nyilasi&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A1bor%20P%C3%B6l%C3%B6skei\"&gt;P\u00f6l\u00f6skei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Fazekas\"&gt;Fazekas&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20T%C3%B3th%20%28footballer%20born%201951%29\"&gt;T\u00f3th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Kiss%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Kiss&lt;/a&gt; (3) and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1z%C3%A1r%20Szentes\"&gt;Szentes&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of the big victory, Hungary lost to 4\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Maradona\"&gt;Maradona&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in the second match of the group stages. Maradona scored twice, while the only Hungarian goal was scored by P\u00f6l\u00f6skei at the &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Rico%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Estadio Jos\u00e9 Rico P\u00e9rez&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alicante\"&gt;Alicante&lt;/a&gt;. Although Hungary drew in the last match against &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, they were eliminated from the World Cup. However, Hungary was leading in the first half thanks to a goal by &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Varga%20%28footballer%20born%201954%29\"&gt;Varga&lt;/a&gt;. \nHungary's last World Cup appearance was the &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1986 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. In the first match of the group Hungary lost 6\u20130 to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. Football experts date the crisis of the Hungarian football from this match. Although Hungary won their second match against &lt;a href=\"Canada%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; by 2\u20130 (the goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1rton%20Esterh%C3%A1zy\"&gt;Esterh\u00e1zy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20D%C3%A9t%C3%A1ri\"&gt;D\u00e9t\u00e1ri&lt;/a&gt;), they lost to &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Platini\"&gt;Platini&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the last group match. This has been the last World Cup appearance of the Hungarian national team.\n1990s.\nDuring the 1990s Hungary were not able to qualify for any international tournaments except for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, the United States. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996 Hungary reached its lowest &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20ranking\"&gt;FIFA ranking&lt;/a&gt; (87). The fall of the &lt;a href=\"Communist\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like &lt;a href=\"Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC\"&gt;Ferencv\u00e1ros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Ajpest%20FC\"&gt;\u00dajpest&lt;/a&gt; faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencv\u00e1ros, \u00dajpest, Honv\u00e9d and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the &lt;a href=\"Bosman%20ruling\"&gt;Bosman ruling&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with the richer Western European clubs. The crisis in the Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.\nThe Hungarian legend &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s\"&gt;Pusk\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. However, he led the team during only four matches. Consequently, the coaching of the former &lt;a href=\"Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC\"&gt;Honv\u00e9d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; legend could not change anything. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of the Hungarian national team for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antal%20Dunai\"&gt;Dunai&lt;/a&gt;'s team played its first group match against &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and lost to 1\u20130 in &lt;a href=\"Orlando%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. In the second group match Hungary played with &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and lost to 3\u20131. The only Hungarian goal was scored by &lt;a href=\"Csaba%20Madar\"&gt;Madar&lt;/a&gt;. The last group match was played against &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Hungary lost to 3\u20132. The Hungarian goals were scored by &lt;a href=\"Csaba%20Madar\"&gt;Madar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tam%C3%A1s%20S%C3%A1ndor\"&gt;S\u00e1ndor&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was a big surprise and people thought that Hungary would have a better future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.\nIn the 1990s Hungary were the closest to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; but they were eliminated in the play-offs by &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;FR Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\n2000s.\nThe most talented players of the 2000s were &lt;a href=\"Zolt%C3%A1n%20Gera\"&gt;Gera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1l%20D%C3%A1rdai\"&gt;D\u00e1rdai&lt;/a&gt;. Both played abroad (Gera in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fulham%20F.C.\"&gt;Fulham F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, while D\u00e1rdai in the &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20BSC\"&gt;Hertha BSC&lt;/a&gt;). However, other significant players did not emerge in order to form a strong national team which resulted the consecutive failures of the qualification for the international competitions in the 2000s. Hungary were unable to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA Euro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, during the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20C\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008 qualification&lt;/a&gt; Hungary finished sixth in their group reaching their nadir in their football history. They even lost to &lt;a href=\"Malta%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; which resulted the resignation of &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20Bozsik\"&gt;Bozsik&lt;/a&gt;. Couple of days later &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20V%C3%A1rhidi\"&gt;V\u00e1rhidi&lt;/a&gt; was appointed who was famous for his appearances in the &lt;a href=\"Sport%201%20%28Europe%29\"&gt;Sport 1&lt;/a&gt;, Hungarian sport television, and analysing the Italian &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; clubs. He proved his talent by beating the 2006 FIFA World Champions &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; by 3\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s%20Stadium%20%281953%29\"&gt;Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly tie. However, neither Bozsik nor V\u00e1rhidi could do well in the official matches which resulted their removal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Hungarian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; even tried out foreign coaches. Both &lt;a href=\"Lothar%20Matth%C3%A4us\"&gt;Matth\u00e4us&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Koeman\"&gt;Koeman&lt;/a&gt; failed to qualify for any tournaments.\nIn the 2000s only the &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20under-20%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; U-20 team could bring back the emotions of the early years. Hungary won a bronze medal in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The new talents of the U-20 team were immediately signed by foreign clubs. &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Koman\"&gt;Koman&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sampdoria\"&gt;Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kriszti%C3%A1n%20N%C3%A9meth\"&gt;N\u00e9meth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%81d%C3%A1m%20Simon%20%28footballer%20born%201990%29\"&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"US%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;. However, the big question was whether they can develop enough to be able to play in the senior team.\n2010s.\nEuro 2012 qualifying.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Euro%202012%20qualifying\"&gt;Euro 2012 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; Hungary was drawn into &lt;a href=\"Euro%202012%20qualifying%20Group%20E\"&gt;Group E&lt;/a&gt;. On 3 September Hungary lost 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A5sunda%20Stadium\"&gt;R\u00e5sunda Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Solna%20Municipality\"&gt;Solna&lt;/a&gt;. In the second match Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"Moldova%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt; by 2\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Szusza%20Ferenc%20Stadium\"&gt;Szusza Ferenc Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. In the 50th &lt;a href=\"Gergely%20Rudolf\"&gt;Rudolf&lt;/a&gt; and in the 66th &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Koman\"&gt;Koman&lt;/a&gt; scored. On 8 October 2010, Hungary scored eight goals against &lt;a href=\"San%20Marino%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;San Marino&lt;/a&gt; at the Puk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadium. &lt;a href=\"%C3%81d%C3%A1m%20Szalai\"&gt;Szalai&lt;/a&gt; scored a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt;. On 12 October, after many years Hungary was able to win away against a team which was ranked ahead. Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"Finland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; by 2\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Helsinki%29\"&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"%C3%81d%C3%A1m%20Szalai\"&gt;Szalai&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Bal%C3%A1zs%20Dzsudzs%C3%A1k\"&gt;Dzsudzs\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt;'s goal resulted the success. In the spring of 2011 Hungary played with &lt;a href=\"World%20Cup%202010\"&gt;World Cup 2010&lt;/a&gt; finalist &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. At home Hungary was beaten by 4\u20130, while away 5\u20133. Although &lt;a href=\"Zolt%C3%A1n%20Gera\"&gt;Gera&lt;/a&gt; scored twice and &lt;a href=\"Gergely%20Rudolf\"&gt;Rudolf&lt;/a&gt; once, Hungary was unable to win or draw at the &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam%20Arena\"&gt;Amsterdam Arena&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 June 2011 Hungary beat San Marino away by 3\u20130. On 2 September 2011, Egerv\u00e1ri had to leave out the key people (Dzsudzs\u00e1k, Juh\u00e1sz and Gera) from the national side due to injuries and suspension. In spite of the difficulties Hungary beat Sweden at home. &lt;a href=\"Imre%20Szabics\"&gt;Szabics&lt;/a&gt; scored against &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; at the Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadium in the last minutes of the first half. However, Sweden equalized in the second half. A late goal by &lt;a href=\"Gergely%20Rudolf\"&gt;Rudolf&lt;/a&gt; resulted the celebration of 25,000 spectators after beating Sweden by 2\u20131 at the Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadium. On 6 September 2011, Hungary beat &lt;a href=\"Moldova%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 at the &lt;a href=\"Zimbru%20Stadium\"&gt;Zimbru Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;. An early goal by &lt;a href=\"Vilmos%20Vancz%C3%A1k\"&gt;Vancz\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt; in the 7th minute calmed down the national side and in the second half a goal by Rudolf secured the victory away in order to stay in the hunt for the play-offs of the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Since Hungary won the two matches in September 2011 there was still hope for the play-offs of the Euro 2012 qualifiers. In September 2011 Hungary reached its highest &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20ranking\"&gt;FIFA ranking&lt;/a&gt; in the team's history with the 27th position due to the victories over Sweden and Moldova in the qualifiers. In the penultimate round of the Euro 2012 qualifiers Sweden beat Finland away (2\u20131), as a consequence the last match was without any stake for the Hungarian national side which left its mark on it. Hungary drew with Finland at home (0\u20130).\nIn the last two matches of the year 2011 Hungary played with &lt;a href=\"Liechtenstein%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/a&gt; at home (the match was aimed as a commemoration of the recently deceased football legend &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%B3ri%C3%A1n%20Albert\"&gt;Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Albert&lt;/a&gt; who was the only Hungarian football player who won the prize &lt;a href=\"Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;Ballon d'Or&lt;/a&gt;) and the Euro 2012 hosts &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; away. On 1 June 2012 in a friendly tier Hungary beat the Czech Republic by 2\u20131. Egerv\u00e1ri invited &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20Szak%C3%A1ly\"&gt;Szak\u00e1ly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norbert%20M%C3%A9sz%C3%A1ros\"&gt;M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%81d%C3%A1m%20Gyurcs%C3%B3\"&gt;Gyurcs\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Gyurcs\u00f3 was the first player from the Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Academy and he contributed to the success by a late goal. Three days later Hungary drew with &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%28FAI%29\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nFIFA 2014 qualifying.\nHungary started the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20world%20cup%202014%20qualifying\"&gt;FIFA world cup 2014 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; campaign in group D along with the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estonia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1ndor%20Egerv%C3%A1ri\"&gt;Egerv\u00e1ri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"head%20coach\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; of the national team, said in an interview with the FIFA that Netherlands are the favourites and the battle for the second place will be between Romania, Turkey and Hungary. On 7 September, Hungary started the FIFA world cup 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5\u20130 win over Andorra. Just four days later Hungary lost to the Netherlands at home 4\u20131. On 12 October &lt;a href=\"Tam%C3%A1s%20Hajnal\"&gt;Tam\u00e1s Hajnal&lt;/a&gt; celebrated his 50th appearance in the national team with a goal against &lt;a href=\"Estonia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; which resulted the 1\u20130 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20states\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ugric%20languages\"&gt;linguistic relatives&lt;/a&gt; in the FIFA world cup 2014 qualifiers. Four days later, on 16 October 2012 Hungary battle back to beat &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; at home 3\u20131. In March 2013 Hungary played two crucial matches in their group. On 22 March 2013 Hungary drew with &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; at the empty Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadium. &lt;a href=\"Vilmos%20Vancz%C3%A1k\"&gt;Vancz\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt;'s header was equalized by &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Mutu\"&gt;Mutu&lt;/a&gt;'s penalty, while Dzsudzs\u00e1k's penalty was equalized by &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Chipciu\"&gt;Chipciu&lt;/a&gt;'s late goal finishing the match 2-2. and on 26 March 2013 Turkey hosted Hungary at the &lt;a href=\"%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC%20Saraco%C4%9Flu%20Stadium\"&gt;\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1niel%20B%C3%B6de\"&gt;B\u00f6de&lt;/a&gt;'s equalizer secured a 1\u20131 draw in Turkey. Hungary prepared for their crucial autumnal FIFA qualifiers with a 1\u20131 draw against the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; at home and on 6 September 2013 Hungary lost 3\u20130 to Romania in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. Four days later Hungary beat Estonia 5\u20131 at home, On 11 October 2013 Hungary suffered an 8\u20131 record defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam%20Arena\"&gt;Amsterdam Arena&lt;/a&gt; against the Netherlands, which resulted the resignation of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1ndor%20Egerv%C3%A1ri\"&gt;Egerv\u00e1ri&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, on 14 October 2013 Cs\u00e1bi, caretaker, led the team against Andorra in a 2\u20130 victory.\nEuro 2016 qualifying.\n Hungary were drawn in Group D in their &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20world%20cup%202014%20qualifying\"&gt;FIFA World Cup 2014 qualifying&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estonia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt;. They had 14 points going into the penultimate round of games, but suffered a joint national record defeat 8\u20131 to the Netherlands, which resulted in the resignation of head coach &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A1ndor%20Egerv%C3%A1ri\"&gt;Egerv\u00e1ri&lt;/a&gt;. For their final group game, a 2\u20130 win against Andorra, Hungary were led by caretaker manager J\u00f3zsef Cs\u00e1bi. They finished in third place in the group, on seventeen points, missing out on qualification. After the match, striker &lt;a href=\"%C3%81d%C3%A1m%20Szalai\"&gt;\u00c1d\u00e1m Szalai&lt;/a&gt; gave a press conference delivering a poignant scathing monologue about his perception of \"continuously lying to our supporters\" when it came to suggesting that the team had a chance against current leading teams of the world.
