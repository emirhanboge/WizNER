It is sponsored by Tiger Chips, and known as the Tiger Egypt Cup for sponsorship purposes. It started with the First Preliminary Round on 12 January 2021, and will conclude with the final on 19 October 2021.\n&lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Egyptian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Al%20Ahly%20SC\"&gt;Al Ahly&lt;/a&gt; are the defending champions, having defeated &lt;a href=\"Tala%27ea%20El%20Gaish%20SC\"&gt;Tala'ea El Gaish&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Egypt%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe competition was originally scheduled to start in November 2020, but was postponed to early 2021 due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Egypt\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule is as follows.\nFormat.\nParticipation.\nThe Egypt Cup begin with a round of 32 teams. The 18 teams of the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Egyptian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, along with the 14 winning teams qualified from the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egypt%20Cup%20qualifying%20rounds%23Fourth%20Preliminary%20Round\"&gt;Fourth Preliminary Round&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egypt%20Cup%20qualifying%20rounds\"&gt;2020\u201321 Egypt Cup qualifying rounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the main competition was held at the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Egyptian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Gezira%20%28Cairo%29\"&gt;Gezira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; on 6 February 2021.\nThe 32 participating teams were separated into 3 pots. Pot 1 included the 15th placed team from the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;previous season&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Egyptian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; alongside the 3 promoted teams from the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Egyptian%20Second%20Division\"&gt;2019\u201320 Egyptian Second Division&lt;/a&gt;, Pot 2 included the top 14 teams from the previous season of the Egyptian Premier League, and Pot 3 included all 14 teams who qualified to the competition through the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egypt%20Cup%20qualifying%20rounds\"&gt;qualifying rounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeams from Pot 1 were drawn against each other, while teams from Pot 2 were drawn against teams from Pot 3.\nUsually, the Egypt Cup defending champions and the Egyptian Premier League winners are placed in different paths, so both teams can face each other only in the final. However, since &lt;a href=\"Al%20Ahly%20SC\"&gt;Al Ahly&lt;/a&gt; won both the cup and the league last season, the club was placed in the \"league path\" while the league runners-up, &lt;a href=\"Zamalek%20SC\"&gt;Zamalek&lt;/a&gt;, were placed in the \"cup path\".\nMatch rules.\nTeams meet in one game per round. Matches take place for 90 minutes, with two-halves of 45 minutes. If still tied after regulation, 30 minutes of &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; will be played, consisting of two periods of 15 minutes. If the score is still level after this, the match will be decided by a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt;. A coin toss will decide who takes the first penalty. A total of seven players are allowed to be listed on the substitute bench, with up to three substitutions being allowed during regulation.\nAll matches will be played on venues selected by the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Egyptian Football Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nChampion qualification.\nThe winners of the Egypt Cup will earn automatic qualification for the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20CAF%20Confederation%20Cup\"&gt;2021\u201322 CAF Confederation Cup&lt;/a&gt;. If they have already qualified for the &lt;a href=\"CAF%20Confederation%20Cup\"&gt;CAF Confederation Cup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"CAF%20Champions%20League\"&gt;CAF Champions League&lt;/a&gt; through their position in the Egyptian Premier League, then the spot will go to the cup runners-up. If the cup runners-up also qualified for an African competition through their league position, then the spot will be given to the fourth placed team in the league.\nFollowing the postponement of numerous match in the competition throughout the season, the competition was not finished by the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20African%20Football\"&gt;CAF&lt;/a&gt; deadline for associations to submit participating teams in next season's African competitions. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Egyptian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; announced that &lt;a href=\"Pyramids%20FC\"&gt;Pyramids&lt;/a&gt;, who were at fourth place after 29 rounds (the last completed round in the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2020\u201321 Egyptian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; before the CAF deadline), would take the cup winners slot and would represent Egypt in the 2021\u201322 CAF Confederation Cup instead of the cup winners.\nQualifying rounds.\nAll of the competing teams that are not members of the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Egyptian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; had to compete in the qualifying rounds to secure one of 14 available places in the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Egypt%20Cup%23Round%20of%2032\"&gt;Round\u00a0of\u00a032&lt;/a&gt;.
