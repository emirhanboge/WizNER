    "text": "William Joseph Ott (November 23, 1940 \u2013 February 18, 2015) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player, an &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; whose six-season (1960\u20131965) career included stints with the and &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"switch%20hitter\"&gt;switch hitter&lt;/a&gt; who threw &lt;a href=\"right-handed\"&gt;right-handed&lt;/a&gt;, Ott stood tall and weighed in his playing days. He signed with the Cubs after graduating from &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Hayes%20High%20School\"&gt;Cardinal Hayes High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bronx%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; and attending &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%20University%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;St. John's University&lt;/a&gt;.\nOtt earned a late-season recall to Chicago after his best &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; campaign, when he hit 23 &lt;a href=\"home%20runs\"&gt;home runs&lt;/a&gt; and compiled 88 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; for the 1962 &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Missions\"&gt;San Antonio Missions&lt;/a&gt; of the Double-A &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in 12 &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; and on September 17 he hit his only Major League home run, a solo shot off &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Washburn\"&gt;Ray Washburn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964, he was called up from the Triple-A &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City%20Bees\"&gt;Salt Lake City Bees&lt;/a&gt; in June and was the immediate successor to &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Brock\"&gt;Lou Brock&lt;/a&gt; as the Cubs' starting &lt;a href=\"right%20fielder\"&gt;right fielder&lt;/a&gt; on June 16. Brock had been &lt;a href=\"Brock%20for%20Broglio\"&gt;traded to the Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; a day earlier in what would come to be considered as one of the more one-sided transactions in MLB annals. Ott collected one &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt;, off &lt;a href=\"left-hander\"&gt;left-hander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Bennett%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Dennis Bennett&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; on the day. He would start four more times in right field during the next week, but registered only four hits in 22 &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt; during that time, and he returned to the minor leagues after his final Cub appearance in mid-July.\nAll told, Ott played in 32 Major League games and batted 67 times, with 11 hits. Upon leaving baseball, he became a police officer and a professional &lt;a href=\"locksmith\"&gt;locksmith&lt;/a&gt; in his native New York City."
