    "text": "Carcinosoma (meaning \"crab body\") is a genus of &lt;a href=\"eurypterid\"&gt;eurypterid&lt;/a&gt;, an extinct group of aquatic &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s. Fossils of \"Carcinosoma\" are restricted to deposits of &lt;a href=\"late%20Silurian\"&gt;late Silurian&lt;/a&gt; (Late &lt;a href=\"Llandovery%20epoch\"&gt;Llandovery&lt;/a&gt; to Early &lt;a href=\"Pridoli%20epoch\"&gt;Pridoli&lt;/a&gt;) age. Classified as part of the family &lt;a href=\"Carcinosomatidae\"&gt;Carcinosomatidae&lt;/a&gt;, which the genus lends its name to, \"Carcinosoma\" contains seven species from &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarcinosomatid eurypterids had unusual proportions and features compared to other eurypterids, with a broad abdomen, thin and long tail and spined and forward-facing walking appendages. They were not as streamlined as other groups but had considerably more robust and well developed walking appendages. In \"Carcinosoma\", these spined walking appendages are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The &lt;a href=\"telson\"&gt;telson&lt;/a&gt; (the posteriormost division of the body) of \"Carcinosoma\" appears to have possessed distinct segmentation, \"Carcinosoma\" is the only known eurypterid to possess this feature.\nAt in length, the species \"C. punctatum\" is the largest &lt;a href=\"Carcinosomatoidea\"&gt;carcinosomatoid&lt;/a&gt; eurypterid by far and is among the largest eurypterids overall, rivalling the large &lt;a href=\"Pterygotidae\"&gt;pterygotid&lt;/a&gt; eurypterids (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Jaekelopterus\"&gt;Jaekelopterus&lt;/a&gt;\") in size. Other species of the genus were considerably smaller, with most ranging from to in length.\nDescription.\n\"Carcinosoma\" was among the largest &lt;a href=\"eurypterids\"&gt;eurypterids&lt;/a&gt;, with isolated fossil remains consisting of a long &lt;a href=\"metastoma\"&gt;metastoma&lt;/a&gt; (a plate overlaying the &lt;a href=\"Arthropod%20coxa\"&gt;coxae&lt;/a&gt; of the first six appendages) of the species \"C. punctatum\" indicating a full length of . Fossil prosomal appendages (appendages attached to the head) referred to the species could possibly increase this estimate to an overall length of around . This massive size makes \"C. punctatum\" the largest of all known &lt;a href=\"Carcinosomatoidea\"&gt;carcinosomatoid&lt;/a&gt; eurypterids and it rivals the largest &lt;a href=\"Pterygotidae\"&gt;pterygotid&lt;/a&gt; eurypterids, such as the long \"&lt;a href=\"Jaekelopterus\"&gt;Jaekelopterus&lt;/a&gt;\", in size. Other species of \"Carcinosoma\" were smaller, most being in the range of to in length.\nPerhaps the most recognizable features of \"Carcinosoma\" are its spined appendages and its broad and flattened &lt;a href=\"mesosoma\"&gt;mesosoma&lt;/a&gt; (the first six segments of its abdomen). &lt;a href=\"Carcinosomatidae\"&gt;Carcinosomatid&lt;/a&gt; eurypterids such as \"Carcinosoma\" had less streamlined bodies than those of some other groups, notably the highly streamlined pterygotid eurypterids. In contrast, the walking legs of the carcinosomatids were in general more robust and better developed. Indeed, the walking legs (the second to fifth pair of appendages) were stout and strong and increased in size &lt;a href=\"anteriorly\"&gt;anteriorly&lt;/a&gt;, from the fifth to third pair of appendages, though the first pair of appendages were much shorter than the following pairs. As such, the second pair of walking legs were the longest. Each walking appendage possessed long and curved spines, often two such spines occurring per joint. These spines are one of the defining features of the carcinosomatid family, along with that the swimming legs have slightly elongated and expanded seventh and eighth &lt;a href=\"podomere\"&gt;podomere&lt;/a&gt;s (leg segments).\nThe body of \"Carcinosoma\" was somewhat oddly proportioned in comparison to other eurypterids, though similar to that of related carcinosomatids (particularly \"&lt;a href=\"Eusarcana\"&gt;Eusarcana&lt;/a&gt;\"). The preabdomen (frontal part of the body) was broad and ovally shaped whilst the postabdomen (the posterior part of the body) was narrow and cylindrical. The &lt;a href=\"prosoma\"&gt;prosoma&lt;/a&gt; (head) was subtriangular in shape with the small compound eyes placed at the front. The &lt;a href=\"metasoma\"&gt;metasoma&lt;/a&gt; of \"Carcinosoma\" was covered in fine and elongated scales and was quite flat, a feature which separates the genus from \"Eusarcana\" where the metasoma was almost cylindrical.\nColor.\nA well-preserved specimen of \"C. newlini\", specimen number 502 in the collections of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; (collected in the &lt;a href=\"Kokomo%20Formation\"&gt;Kokomo Formation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;), preserves the integument in enough detail to determine the coloration \"C. newlini\" would have possessed in life. By surveying the distribution of fossilized pigment cells and comparing them with those of modern &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, scientists were able to see the pattern and specific colors \"C. newlini\" would have possessed in life.\nOverall, the color was similar to that of modern scorpions and to that of another eurypterid which had been similarly studied, \"&lt;a href=\"Megalograptus\"&gt;Megalograptus ohioensis&lt;/a&gt;\". The dorsal side of the prosoma, mesosoma and the &lt;a href=\"tergites\"&gt;tergites&lt;/a&gt; (segments) of the metasoma were light brown while elongated scales alongside the exoskeleton were darker brown grading into black at the apex of the scales. Smaller scales alongside the edges of the metasomal tergites were also brown but contrasted against the lighter brown of the other integument. The &lt;a href=\"Eurypterid%23Morphology\"&gt;operculum&lt;/a&gt; (the first and second abdominal segments) and the plates of the abdomen were brown but lighter than the tergites and their scales were, as with the other scales, darker than the surrounding integument.\nBlack-tipped scales also occurred on the legs, where the general integument was dark brown. The spines of the walking legs were dark brown but black at their tips. The flattened scales on the swimming paddles also graded into black, though the paddle was otherwise brown. The coxae were light brown, with darker scales. The gnathobases (\"tooth-plates\" on the coxae used when feeding) were completely black, as were the &lt;a href=\"telson\"&gt;telson&lt;/a&gt; (the posteriormost division of the body) whose color contrasted with the preceding and adjacent brown segment.\nSize.\n\"Carcinosoma\" ranged in size from to in length, with the largest species by far being \"C. punctatum\", known from the &lt;a href=\"Ludlow%20epoch\"&gt;Ludlow epoch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, and the smallest being \"C. libertyi\", known from the Late &lt;a href=\"Llandovery%20epoch\"&gt;Llandovery epoch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Though no other species came close to the size of \"C. punctatum\", many species were moderately large, including \"C. harleyi\" from the Late Ludlow epoch of England at , \"C. newlini\" from the Early &lt;a href=\"Pridoli%20epoch\"&gt;Pridoli epoch&lt;/a&gt; of the United States at , \"C. scoticus\" from the Llandovery epoch of &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; at and \"C. spiniferum\" from the Late Ludlow epoch of the United States at . The second smallest known species was \"C. scorpioides\" from the &lt;a href=\"Wenlock%20epoch\"&gt;Wenlock epoch&lt;/a&gt; of Scotland at in length.\nHistory of research.\n\"Carcinosoma\" was first described under the name \"Eurysoma\" (meaning \"wide body\", deriving from &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2, \"wide\", and &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"soma\", \"body\") by British American geologist and paleobotanist &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Waller%20Claypole\"&gt;Edward Waller Claypole&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, who named the type species of the new genus \"E. newlini\" in honor of a C. E. Newlin who had collected the fossils. The \"Eurysoma\" specimens had been discovered in deposits of Early Pridoli age in the Kokomo Formation of Indiana alongside several other eurypterid specimens, all of which at the time were referred to \"Eurypterus lacustris\" (though Claypole noted in the same paper that this may have been done hastily). Later in the same year, Claypole discovered that the name \"Eurysoma\" was &lt;a href=\"preoccupied\"&gt;preoccupied&lt;/a&gt; and thus not available to be used for his genus of eurypterids. \"Eurysoma\" had been named in 1831 for a genus of modern &lt;a href=\"beetles\"&gt;beetles&lt;/a&gt; and is today considered synonymous with the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Brachygnathus\"&gt;Brachygnathus&lt;/a&gt;\". Claypole replaced the name \"Eurysoma\" with the new name \"Carcinosoma\". \"Carcinosoma\" means \"crab body\" deriving from Latin \"cancer\", \"crab\", and \"soma\", \"body\".\nIn 1868, English geologist and paleontologist &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Woodward%20%28geologist%29\"&gt;Henry Woodward&lt;/a&gt; named a new species of \"Eurypterus\", \"E. scorpioides\", based on fossils from &lt;a href=\"Lanarkshire\"&gt;Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. Woodward could easily distinguish the species from other genera present at the locality, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Slimonia\"&gt;Slimonia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pterygotus\"&gt;Pterygotus&lt;/a&gt;\". Another species of \"Eurypterus\", \"E. scoticus\" was named in 1899 by Scottish zoologist and paleontologist &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Laurie\"&gt;Malcolm Laurie&lt;/a&gt; based on fragmentary remains recovered in deposits of Llandovery age in Scotland.\nIn 1912, American paleontologists &lt;a href=\"John%20Mason%20Clarke\"&gt;John Mason Clarke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Ruedemann\"&gt;Rudolf Ruedemann&lt;/a&gt; noted that \"Carcinosoma\" was sufficiently similar to the related eurypterid \"Eusarcus\" to be designated as &lt;a href=\"taxonomic%20synonym\"&gt;synonymous&lt;/a&gt; with it. As \"Eusarcus\" had been named in 1875, fifteen years earlier than \"Carcinosoma\", its name had priority and replaced \"Carcinosoma\". At this time, the combined genus of \"Eusarcus\" contained several species that are today seen as \"Carcinosoma\", including \"C. newlini\", \"C. scoticus\" and \"C. scorpioides\", which Clarke and Ruedemann had referred to the genus on account of their similarities with \"C. newlini\" and species previously referred to \"Eusarcus\". In 1934, 59 years after it had been described, \"Eusarcus\" was recognized as a name preoccupied by a &lt;a href=\"harvestman\"&gt;harvestman&lt;/a&gt;. The Norwegian geologist &lt;a href=\"Leif%20St%C3%B8rmer\"&gt;Leif St\u00f8rmer&lt;/a&gt; proposed that the name of the taxon should be next oldest available and valid name for the genus, \"Carcinosoma\". During the preparation for his paper on the issue, St\u00f8rmer also discussed the situation with fellow Norwegian researcher &lt;a href=\"Embrik%20Strand\"&gt;Embrik Strand&lt;/a&gt;, who helped confirm that \"Carcinosoma\" was not preoccupied.\nStrand would subsequently propose the replacement name \"Eusarcana\" in 1942, despite the problem having been dealt with by St\u00f8rmer, who he had been in contact with, eight years earlier. The reasons for proposing the name during the circumstances of the time remains unknown, but critique from contemporary researchers of Strand for his studies in systematics and an apparent desire to name as many taxa as possible may explain the situation somewhat. As it was seen as completely unnecessary at the time, Strand's \"Eusarcana\" was overlooked and not even mentioned in subsequent eurypterid studies.\nIn 1961, American paleontologist Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering classified \"Eurypterus punctatus\" (originally described as \"Pterygotus punctatus\" by English paleontologist and prominent eurypterid researcher &lt;a href=\"John%20William%20Salter\"&gt;John William Salter&lt;/a&gt; in 1859) as \"Carcinosoma punctatum\" and named a new species \"C. harleyi\" based on fossils from the Ludlow epoch of the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Borderland%20Fault%20System\"&gt;Welsh Borderland&lt;/a&gt;. Kjellesvig-Waering could differentiate \"C. harleyi\" from \"C. punctatum\" based on \"C. harleyi\" lacking serrations on the eighth podomere of the swimming leg and the serrations of the ninth podomere being less developed.\n\"C. punctatum\" was diagnosed by Kjellesvig-Waering in 1961 based on the considerably pronounced serrations of the &lt;a href=\"distal\"&gt;distal&lt;/a&gt; parts of its swimming leg, but the diagnosis is only valid for the &lt;a href=\"lectotype\"&gt;lectotype&lt;/a&gt; specimen of the species, BGS GSM89435 (compromising the distal parts of a swimming leg discovered in deposits of Middle Ludlow age in the Mocktree Shale of Leintwardine in Herefordshire, England), and four other specimens from the same locality (BMNH 39389, BMNH In. 43804, BGS GSM89561 and GSM89568). Due to a close resemblance of the swimming legs, \"C. punctatum\" is assumed to have been similar in appearance to \"C. newlini\". \"C. punctatum\" can be distinguished from \"C. newlini\" by the serration along the margin of the distal podomeres of \"C. punctatum\" being more pronounced.\n\"C. harleyi\", from the Late Ludlow epoch, was described mainly based on specimens previously known (some having been reported by Salter as early as 1859) but previously referred to \"Eurypterus punctatus\". Recognized by Kjellesvig-Waering as distinct, the species is named in honor of John Harley, one of the earliest collectors of eurypterid fossils in the region. Noted as moderately large in size by Kjellesvig-Waering, the &lt;a href=\"holotype%20specimen\"&gt;holotype specimen&lt;/a&gt; of \"C. harleyi\" (No. 89434 in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Geological%20Museum\"&gt;Geological Survey and Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London) is a fragment of a swimming leg measuring in length. The nearly complete lack of serrations in the joints of \"C. harleyi\" makes the species very distinct from \"C. punctatum\" and other species of \"Carcinosoma\".\nIn 1964, both \"C. punctatum\" and \"C. harleyi\" were still recognized as part of \"Carcinosoma\" following an emended diagnosis of the genus by Kjellesvig-Waering and American paleontologist Kenneth Edward Caster, though \"C. harleyi\" was only tentatively recognized. Further species recognized at the time were \"C. libertyi\" and \"C. logani\" (both from Ontario, Canada; \"C. logani\" was later found to be a &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt; and not a eurypterid at all), \"C. spiniferum\" (from New York, United States), \"C. newlini\" (from Indiana, United States), \"C. scorpioides\" and \"C. scoticus\" (both from Scotland). Out of these species, only \"C. newlini\" and \"C. scorpioides\" preserve the swimming legs, where the diagnostic characters of the genus are, which makes the assignment of the other species to \"Carcinosoma\" less secure. Kjellesvig-Waering and Caster also recognized \"Eusarcus\" and \"Carcinosoma\" to be distinct genera when revising the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea, and coined the replacement name \"Paracarcinosoma\" to designate the species previously assigned to \"Eusarcus\". \"E. scorpionis\" was designated the &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt;. Caster and Kjellesvig-Waering made no mention of Embrik Strand or \"Eusarcana\", and they were likely not aware of the existence of the previous name. In 2012, American paleontologists Jason A. Dunlop and James Lamsdell designated \"Paracarcinosoma\" as a &lt;a href=\"junior%20synonym\"&gt;junior synonym&lt;/a&gt; of \"Eusarcana\" per the taxonomic laws of priority.\nClassification.\n\"Carcinosoma\" is classified as part of the family Carcinosomatidae, a family within the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea, alongside the genera \"Eusarcana\", \"&lt;a href=\"Eocarcinosoma\"&gt;Eocarcinosoma&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Rhinocarcinosoma\"&gt;Rhinocarcinosoma&lt;/a&gt;\" and possibly \"&lt;a href=\"Holmipterus\"&gt;Holmipterus&lt;/a&gt;\". The cladogram below is adapted from a larger cladogram (simplified to only display the Carcinosomatoidea) in a 2007 study by eurypterid researcher O. Erik Tetlie, in turn based on results from various phylogenetic analyses on eurypterids conducted between 2004 and 2007. The second cladogram below is simplified from a study by Lamsdell \"et al.\" (2015).\nTetlie (2007)\nLamsdell \"et al.\" (2015)\nPaleobiology.\nThe walking legs of \"Carcinosoma\" were turned forward, which also directed the large spines on the appendages forward. In \"C. newlini\", these flat and forward-facing legs are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The strong structures seen in \"C. newlini\" are not reflected in other carcinosomatids. For instance, the appendages of \"Eusarcana\" were much more weakly developed and would not have served as an effective weapon. \"Eusarcana\" is more likely to have relied on its telson, taking the shape of a sharp and curved stinger similar to that of scorpions and potentially capable of injecting venom.\nInstead of taking the shape of a scorpion-like stinger, the telson of \"Carcinosoma\" was slightly flattened and expanded anteriorly. The telsons of most eurypterids ends in a spike but the telson of \"Carcinosoma\" ended in a small and expanded structure with distinct segmentation, fossils preserving ten segments (though a small portion of the structure is not preserved, making more segments possible), otherwise not definitely reported from a eurypterid. The only other eurypterid from which a segmented structure occurring as part of the telson has been reported in is the &lt;a href=\"Slimonidae\"&gt;slimonid&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Salteropterus\"&gt;Salteropterus abbreviatus&lt;/a&gt;\". With such segmentation reported from two separate eurypterid genera, it is possible that the eurypterid telson is actually developed from a formerly normal abdominal segment and is thus not homologous to the telson of other arthropod groups. Further studies of \"Salteropterus\" has since revealed that the perceived \"segmentation\" of its \"post-telson\" was misinterpreted ornamentation of an elongated and unusually shaped telson and not actual segmentation, making the segmentation of \"Carcinosoma\" unique.\nPaleoecology.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"opisthosoma\"&gt;opisthosoma&lt;/a&gt; of \"Carcinosoma\" wasn't as streamlined as that of more active eurypterids and on account of its unique telson morphology, it is believed that \"Carcinosoma\" was not a very active swimmer. It is unlikely to have been well adapted to a completely &lt;a href=\"nekton\"&gt;nekton&lt;/a&gt;ic (actively swimming) lifestyle and is more likely to have been nektobenthic (swimming near the bottom). The flat metasoma of \"Carcinosoma\" was probably used as at least partially as aid when swimming, suggested by the pretelson being slightly expanded in comparison to other eurypterids.\nAs a considerable majority of described eurypterid species are known from the Silurian, particularly the late Silurian, researchers have concluded that the group peaked in diversity and number during this time. Complex eurypterid faunas, compromising several different species in different &lt;a href=\"Ecological%20niche\"&gt;ecological roles&lt;/a&gt;, are typical of the period. These faunas were typically dominated by one or more particular eurypterid families, the dominant groups depending on the environment and location. Three such types of eurypterid faunas have been documented from the late Silurian, out of which a Carcinosomatidae-Pterygotidae fauna is the most marine type.\nAll known examples of \"Carcinosoma\" are known from marine beds, typically occurring with &lt;a href=\"trilobites\"&gt;trilobites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"starfish\"&gt;starfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bryozoa\"&gt;bryozoa&lt;/a&gt;ns, &lt;a href=\"brachiopods\"&gt;brachiopods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linguloidea\"&gt;linguloids&lt;/a&gt; and other marine animals. \"Carcinosoma\" also prominently occurs together with pterygotid eurypterids. In the fossil deposits of the Welsh Borderland, examples of \"Carcinosoma\" occur together with representatives of the pterygotid genera \"Erettopterus\" and \"Pterygotus\" over a period of millions of years (though other eurypterids, such as \"Salteropterus\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dolichopterus\"&gt;Dolichopterus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hughmilleria\"&gt;Hughmilleria&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Eurypterus\", \"&lt;a href=\"Marsupipterus\"&gt;Marsupipterus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mixopterus\"&gt;Mixopterus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Parahughmilleria\"&gt;Parahughmilleria&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Slimonia\"&gt;Slimonia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Tarsopterella\"&gt;Tarsopterella&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Stylonurus\"&gt;Stylonurus&lt;/a&gt;\" are also present in lesser numbers).\nOther types of late Silurian eurypterid faunas include one dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Eurypteridae\"&gt;Eurypteridae&lt;/a&gt;. When genera such as \"&lt;a href=\"Erieopterus\"&gt;Erieopterus&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Eurypterus\" occur in great numbers other genera and families are more rare, though groups such as &lt;a href=\"Dolichopteridae\"&gt;dolichopterids&lt;/a&gt;, carcinosomatids and pterygotids tend to occur in small numbers. The environments with such faunas appear to be quieter waters such as &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"estuaries\"&gt;estuaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bays\"&gt;bays&lt;/a&gt;. The third and final recognized type of fauna is one dominated by &lt;a href=\"Hughmilleriidae\"&gt;hughmilleriids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stylonuridae\"&gt;stylonurids&lt;/a&gt;, generally alongside sandy bottoms and with few other associated fossils. The environments inhabited by this third fauna was likely less marine than the others, possibly representing the more &lt;a href=\"Brackish%20water\"&gt;brackish&lt;/a&gt; parts of bays and estuaries."
