    "text": "The Simplon Pass (; ; ) () is a high &lt;a href=\"mountain%20pass\"&gt;mountain pass&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Pennine%20Alps\"&gt;Pennine Alps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lepontine%20Alps\"&gt;Lepontine Alps&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. It connects &lt;a href=\"Brig%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Brig&lt;/a&gt; in the canton of &lt;a href=\"Valais\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Domodossola\"&gt;Domodossola&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;). The pass itself and the villages on each side of it, such as &lt;a href=\"Gondo%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Gondo&lt;/a&gt;, are in Switzerland. The &lt;a href=\"Simplon%20Tunnel\"&gt;Simplon Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; was built beneath the vicinity of the pass in the early 20th century to carry rail traffic between the two countries.\nThe lowest point of the &lt;a href=\"col\"&gt;col&lt;/a&gt;, and the lowest point on the watershed between the basins of the &lt;a href=\"Rhone\"&gt;Rhone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Po%20%28river%29\"&gt;Po&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland lies in marshland about west of the Simplon Pass settlement at an altitude of .\n&lt;a href=\"Rotelsee\"&gt;Rotelsee&lt;/a&gt; is a lake located near the pass at an elevation of .\nThere are several high peaks around that can be climbed directly from the pass. These include &lt;a href=\"Wasenhorn\"&gt;Wasenhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hubschhorn\"&gt;Hubschhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breithorn%20%28Simplon%29\"&gt;Breithorn (Simplon)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Leone\"&gt;Monte Leone&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThere had been a locally used passage through the mountains here for several centuries, but the pass acquired international significance during the Napoleonic occupation. Between 1801 and 1805 the Simplon Road was constructed by the engineer &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20C%C3%A9ard\"&gt;Nicolas C\u00e9ard&lt;/a&gt; at the direction of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;the emperor&lt;/a&gt; in order to transport artillery pieces through the pass between the &lt;a href=\"River%20Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; valley and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the pass has been usable by road vehicles: first &lt;a href=\"stage%20coach\"&gt;post carriages&lt;/a&gt;, replaced early in the twentieth century by &lt;a href=\"Postauto\"&gt;post buses&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe road was periodically improved and in 1950 the cantonal authorities created a plan whereby the pass could be kept open all through the year, and not closed to traffic between October and late April like most Alpine passes at this altitude. The improvements included several lengthy avalanche shelters along the more exposed stretches of road and the expansion of certain road tunnels to accommodate full size tourist coaches which were significantly taller than the &lt;a href=\"post%20bus\"&gt;post bus&lt;/a&gt;es used for local passengers. In October 1970, a party of journalists was invited to inspect the improvements and it was announced that the necessary improvements had been implemented on of the between &lt;a href=\"Brig%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Brig&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valais\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt; and the Italian frontier at &lt;a href=\"Gondo%20%28Switzerland%29\"&gt;Gondo&lt;/a&gt;, that 110 of the 180 million Swiss francs budgeted to the project had been spent and that, while a further five years would be needed to complete all the projected improvements, the Simplon Pass could now be used safely all through the year. \nThe former &lt;a href=\"Simplon%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29\"&gt;Simplon d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt; (the Swiss canton &lt;a href=\"Valais\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt;) was named after the pass.\nThe Simplon Pass was also outfitted with rails for train service. The -long &lt;a href=\"Simplon%20Tunnel\"&gt;Simplon Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1906. The historic &lt;a href=\"Orient%20Express\"&gt;Orient Express&lt;/a&gt; used the Simplon route intermittently during the twentieth century, as it carried passengers between &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonuments.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, officers of the 11th Alpine Brigade of the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Army\"&gt;Swiss Army&lt;/a&gt;, based in Zwischbergen, proposed the construction of the stone monument &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Friedrich%20Baumann%23The%20Eagle%20on%20the%20Simplon%20pass\"&gt;depicting an eagle&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol of the brigade. The Bernese architect &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Friedrich%20Baumann\"&gt;Erwin Friedrich Baumann&lt;/a&gt; designed the monument based on the use of granite blocks from the old fortification of &lt;a href=\"Gondo%20%28Switzerland%29\"&gt;Gondo&lt;/a&gt; (a town near the pass) to build a statue about nine meters high. The monument was inaugurated in September 1944.\nIn 2005, a memorial was built representing the 200th anniversary of the construction of the \"Napoleon Road\"."
