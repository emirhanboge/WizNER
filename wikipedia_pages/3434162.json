    "text": "The Defoe Shipbuilding Company was a small ship builder established in 1905 in &lt;a href=\"Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Bay City, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It ceased to operate in 1976 after failing to renew its contracts with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The site of the former company is now being developed for business and housing on the bank of the &lt;a href=\"Saginaw%20River\"&gt;Saginaw River&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding.\n&lt;a href=\"Harry%20J.%20Defoe\"&gt;Harry J. Defoe&lt;/a&gt; organized the Defoe Boat and Motor Works in 1905 on the Saginaw River in Bay City, Michigan. At that time, the firm built \"knock-down\" boats and gasoline powered boats for business and pleasure. In 1917, the company got its first Navy contract for five &lt;a href=\"Spent%20Torpedo%20Chasers\"&gt;Spent Torpedo Chasers&lt;/a&gt;. This order was followed in 1918 by an order for eight &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tumor%20Mine%20Planters\"&gt;Tumor Mine Planters&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1920 to 1939, the company built various types of government and commercial vessels and private yachts, including three 165-ft patrol boats, thirteen 100-ft patrol boats, fifteen &lt;a href=\"75-foot%20patrol%20boat\"&gt;75-foot patrol boat&lt;/a&gt;s and two harbor tugs for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;U.S. Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;. In 1931, Defoe built the \"Lenore\", a yacht for &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Ward\"&gt;Montgomery Ward&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href=\"Sewell%20Avery\"&gt;Sewell Avery&lt;/a&gt;, who named it after his second &lt;a href=\"daughter\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; who died at the age of four; this yacht was taken by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Government\"&gt;U.S. Government&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; for coastal &lt;a href=\"Picket%20%28military%29\"&gt;picket&lt;/a&gt; duty by the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1956 it was assigned as a Presidential &lt;a href=\"Yacht\"&gt;Yacht&lt;/a&gt;. It was called the \"Barbara Anne\" by President &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; after his granddaughter, the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Miscellaneous-Information/Honey-Fitz.aspx\"&gt;\"Honey Fitz\"&lt;/a&gt; by President &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; in honor of his maternal grandfather &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;John Francis Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Tricia\" by President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20M.%20Nixon\"&gt;Nixon&lt;/a&gt; after his daughter. In 1941, the name of the company was changed to Defoe Shipbuilding Company.\nWorld War II.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, all production went to the war effort. From 1939 to 1945, the company built 154 ships, including four s, 13 &lt;a href=\"destroyer%20escorts\"&gt;destroyer escorts&lt;/a&gt;, 11 destroyer transports (converted destroyer escorts), &lt;a href=\"patrol%20craft\"&gt;patrol craft&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous &lt;a href=\"landing%20craft\"&gt;landing craft&lt;/a&gt; of various types. The brand-new Defoe family yacht even served with the US Navy as a patrol vessel. Defoe developed a construction technique called the \"upside-down and roll-over\" method. This allowed most of the &lt;a href=\"welding\"&gt;welding&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; to be done \"hand down\" which is much easier. After the hull was completely welded, it was rolled over by a set of large wheels fastened to each end of the hull. Work then continued on the ship right-side up. Faster welding allowed the company to build one 173-foot patrol craft every week. Of all of the major ships built there, the three that were lost in action during World War II were the destroyer escort , the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;U.S. Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; Cutter , and the patrol craft . &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20chaser\"&gt;Submarine chaser&lt;/a&gt; PC 482 was sunk by a &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; in 1945. Defoe Shipbuilding Company also built three &lt;a href=\"Type%20B%20ship%23Refrigerated%20Freight%20Barges%20YFR%20-%20YFRN\"&gt;Refrigerated Freight Barges&lt;/a&gt; : YFR-888, YFR-889 and YFR-890 in 1945, also called a &lt;a href=\"Reefer%20ship\"&gt;reefer&lt;/a&gt; barge.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, this company built two large Great Lakes bulk carriers, and it did repair work on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; ships including several repowerings, and self-unloading conversions. In later years, several ships were built for the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt;, including two s, four &lt;a href=\"guided%20missile%20destroyers\"&gt;guided missile destroyers&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"Garcia-class%20frigate\"&gt;\"Garcia\"-class destroyer escorts&lt;/a&gt; (later re-classified as frigates) for the U.S. Navy, and three guided-missile &lt;a href=\"destroyers\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Also built there were the research vessels and . This last was the ship that found the wreck of .\nGreat Lakes Bulk Freighters.\nIn the early 1950s Defoe Shipbuilding constructed two large &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20freighter\"&gt;Great Lakes freighter&lt;/a&gt;s. They were both roughly based on &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Steel\"&gt;U.S. Steel&lt;/a&gt;'s Pittsburgh Steamship Company AA Class ship design and shared similar dimensions. As of April 2009, one of the two vessels is still in service on the Great Lakes.\nThe only remaining large Great Lakes bulk freight vessel built by Defoe Shipbuilding still in service is the 642' 03\" long, &lt;a href=\"M/V\"&gt;M/V&lt;/a&gt; \"Ojibway\" (Defoe hull #00422) operated by the Canadian firm Lower Lakes Towing, of Port Dover, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. The \"Ojibway\" was originally built as the steamer \"Charles L. Hutchinson\" (2) for the Pioneer Steamship Company of &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and entered service on September 24, 1952. In 1961, the Hutchinson was sold to &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dearborn%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Dearborn, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and was renamed \"Ernest M. Breech\". In 1988, Ford was in the process of eliminating its Great Lakes shipping fleet and sold the \"Breech\" to &lt;a href=\"George%20Steinbrenner\"&gt;George Steinbrenner&lt;/a&gt;'s Kinsman Marine of Cleveland, Ohio. The Kinsman fleet in turn renamed the vessel \"Kinsman Independent\" (2). She sailed with Kinsman until 2002 when her main unloading dock in &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;, updated its unloading equipment, allowing it to be serviced by newer more common self-unloading vessels. The vessel laid up in Buffalo for the last time under US flag on December 16, 2002. In the spring of 2004, McKeil Marine of &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada purchased the \"Kinsman Independent\". The ship was refurbished and repowered with a &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;, then sold to &lt;a href=\"Voyageur%20Marine%20Transport%20LTD.\"&gt;Voyageur Marine Transport LTD.&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Ridgeville%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Ridgeville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, who returned her to service in late 2005 under the name \"Voyageur Independent\". Her current owner (Lower Lakes Towing) has operated the vessel since August 28, 2007, and renamed her \"Ojibway\" on February 29, 2008.\nThe second &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20freighter\"&gt;Great Lakes freighter&lt;/a&gt; built by Defoe was the 644' long &lt;a href=\"Steamship\"&gt;S/S&lt;/a&gt; \"Richard M. Marshall\" (Defoe hull #00424) which was constructed in 1953 for the Great Lakes Steamship Company, of Cleveland, Ohio. She was a near twin to her predecessor (\"Charles L. Hutchinson\") in size and capacity both having approximate dimensions of 640' long, 67' wide, 35' deep, and a cargo capacity of approximately 18,500 tons. In December, 1956, Great Lakes Steamship started the process of selling off their fleet, and the \"Marshall\" was sold to The &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Mutual%20Life%20Insurance%20Company\"&gt;Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company&lt;/a&gt;. Starting with the 1957 season, Northwestern Mutual chartered the ship to the Wilson Marine Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio, who in turn renamed the vessel \"Joseph S. Wood\". In 1966, the charter agreement between Wilson and Northwestern Mutual was canceled, and the vessel was sold to the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; of Dearborn, Michigan, for $4.3 million (US). Ford renamed the ship \"John Dykstra\" and she resumed trading on the Great Lakes on May 11, 1966. In 1983, Ford renamed the ship \"Benson Ford\" (2) after the retirement of the original S/S \"Benson Ford\". In 1985, the vessel was renamed \"US.265808\" (the name Benson Ford being passed on to a third vessel), and was withdrawn from service. The final voyage began when she cleared &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20City\"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, Canada in tow of the Polish tug \"Jantar\" on August 11, 1987 along with the former &lt;a href=\"US%20Steel\"&gt;US Steel&lt;/a&gt; freighter \"T. W. Robinson\" bound for &lt;a href=\"Recife%2C%20Brazil\"&gt;Recife, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, for dismantling.\nClosure.\nThe yard closed on 31 December 1976 after the Navy contracts expired. Along with its dwindling navy contracts in its final years, the yard was contracted for three larger Great Lakes Freighter projects. The first project was construction of the 68'x 104'7\"x 46'6\" bow section to the 1000' long integrated tug and barge \"Presque Isle\". The bow was launched July 27, 1972 and was towed to Erie by the tugs Maryland and Laurence C. Turner arriving October 6, 1972. There it was combined with the remainder of the barge which was under construction at Erie, PA. The combined tug and barge unit were the second 1000' vessel trading on the lakes. The second was the conversion of 690' S/S \"Herbert C. Jackson\" from a conventional style &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20freighter\"&gt;Great Lakes freighter&lt;/a&gt; to a self unloader. The final major project was the conversion of the 620' lake freighter \"Richard J. Reiss\" from steam to diesel power. All three vessels are still activity trading on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, the latter sailing now as the M/V \"Manistee\". The site of the shipyard later became the location for H. H. Hirschfield &amp; Sons scrap yard. Hirschfield was recently bought by OmniSource, Inc., another scrap company."
