    "text": "Poldhu is a small area in south &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, situated on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lizard\"&gt;Lizard Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;; it comprises Poldhu Point and Poldhu Cove. Poldhu means \"black pool\" in &lt;a href=\"cornish%20language\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt;. Poldhu lies on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Mount%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Mount's Bay&lt;/a&gt; and is in the northern part of the parish of &lt;a href=\"Mullion%2C%20Cornwall\"&gt;Mullion&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Churchtown%2C%20Cornwall\"&gt;churchtown&lt;/a&gt; is to the south-east. On the north side of Poldhu Cove is the parish of &lt;a href=\"Gunwalloe\"&gt;Gunwalloe&lt;/a&gt; and the village of &lt;a href=\"Porthleven\"&gt;Porthleven&lt;/a&gt; is a further to the north.\nPoldhu Point became the site of one of the main technological advances of the early twentieth century when, on 12 December 1901, a &lt;a href=\"wireless\"&gt;wireless signal&lt;/a&gt; was sent by Thomas Barron in Poldhu to &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;St John's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, and received by &lt;a href=\"Guglielmo%20Marconi\"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt;. The technology was a precursor to &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"television\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satellites\"&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Goonhilly%20Satellite%20Earth%20Station\"&gt;earth station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Goonhilly%20Downs\"&gt;Goonhilly Downs&lt;/a&gt; a nearby example.\nIn January 2016 Poldhu Cove was inundated with thousands of pink plastic bottles, brought onto the beach with successive tides. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt; said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather.\nMarconi's Poldhu Wireless Station.\nThe site is famous as the location of Poldhu Wireless Station, &lt;a href=\"Guglielmo%20Marconi\"&gt;Guglielmo Marconi&lt;/a&gt;'s transmitter for the first transatlantic &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; message on 12\u00a0December 1901. Marconi received the transmission on &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Hill%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Signal Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;St.\u00a0John's, Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;. The station was built partly on cliff top pastures that had been enclosed in 1871 and partly on medieval fields belonging to a nearby settlement, Angrouse. The fifty acre (200,000\u00a0m2) plot was bought in 1900 and building work ran from October\u00a01900 to January\u00a01901. During the work two &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age%20Britain\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tumulus%23United%20Kingdom\"&gt;barrows&lt;/a&gt; were flattened and a &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"urn\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; were recovered.\nTo design the spark transmitter, the first high power radio transmitter in the world, Marconi hired Prof. &lt;a href=\"John%20Ambrose%20Fleming\"&gt;John Ambrose Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, University College, London. The original twenty mast circular aerial was destroyed in a storm on 17\u00a0September 1901. Marconi hastily built a temporary aerial of 50\u00a0wires suspended in a fan shape from a cable between two 200\u00a0foot (61\u00a0m) masts. Fleming estimated the transmitter's radiated power was around 10\u201312\u00a0kW. The frequency used is not known precisely, as Marconi did not measure wavelength or frequency, but it was between 166 and 984\u00a0kHz, probably around 500\u00a0kHz. After the experiment the original mast layout was not rebuilt, it was replaced with a four mast design, 215\u00a0feet (66\u00a0m) high and forming a 200-foot (61\u00a0m) square.\nMarconi later used the site for his &lt;a href=\"shortwave\"&gt;shortwave&lt;/a&gt; experiments, with transmissions by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Samuel%20Franklin\"&gt;Charles Samuel Franklin&lt;/a&gt; to Marconi on the yacht in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Verde%20Islands\"&gt;Cape Verde Islands&lt;/a&gt; in 1923 and in &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; in 1924. The groundbreaking results of these experiments took the world by surprise and quickly resulted in his development of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Wireless%20Chain\"&gt;Beam Wireless Service&lt;/a&gt; for the British General Post Office. The service opened from the Bodmin Beam Station to Canada on 25\u00a0October 1926, from the to Australia on 8\u00a0April 1927, from the to South Africa on 5\u00a0July 1927, to India on 6\u00a0September 1927 and shortly afterwards to Argentina, Brazil and the United States.\nThe station closed in 1934 and was demolished in 1937. Six acres (24,000\u00a0m2) were given to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt; in 1937 with the rest of the site added in 1960. The site has a stone monument pillar, erected in November\u00a01937 by the &lt;a href=\"Marconi%20Company\"&gt;Marconi Company&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of concrete foundations and earth structures also remain. In 2001 the \"Marconi Centre\", a new museum / meeting building, was opened close to the site by the efforts of the Poldhu Amateur Radio Club, the National Trust, and &lt;a href=\"Marconi%20plc\"&gt;Marconi plc&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe substantial building near the site, originally the Poldhu Hotel, built in 1899, is currently a &lt;a href=\"Nursing%20home%20care%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;care home&lt;/a&gt;. The visitors' book shows that Marconi stayed there in May and August\u00a01901.\nMarconi also built an earlier, smaller, experimental wireless station nearby at Housel Bay \u2013 &lt;a href=\"The%20Lizard\"&gt;The Lizard Wireless Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn popular culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Sherlock%20Holmes\"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Watson\"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/a&gt; are staying in a cottage above Poldhu beach in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventure%20of%20the%20Devil%27s%20Foot\"&gt;The Adventure of the Devil's Foot&lt;/a&gt;\", a short story by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle\"&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/a&gt;. In the first episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Miss%20Sherlock\"&gt;Miss Sherlock&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Poldhu\" is the name of a brand of wireless &lt;a href=\"medical%20telemetry\"&gt;medical telemetry&lt;/a&gt; devices in the form of a capsule that is swallowed by the user, which the murder exploits as triggers for liquid bombs that destroy the abdominal cavities of her victims."
