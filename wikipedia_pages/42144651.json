    "text": "St Andrew's Brighton is the oldest continuous &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; church in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. St Andrew's is the Anglican &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; of the beachside suburb of &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpened on &lt;a href=\"St%20Andrew%27s%20Day\"&gt;St Andrew's Day&lt;/a&gt; in 1842, St Andrew's was one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; churches established in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District&lt;/a&gt; and predates both the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Anglican Diocese of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and the colony, now state, of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. Located in a large historic precinct in &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Middle Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, including a rare &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20gold%20rush\"&gt;pre-gold rush&lt;/a&gt; graveyard, St Andrew's is one of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; most notable churches, known for its &lt;a href=\"liturgical\"&gt;liturgical&lt;/a&gt; and musical tradition since the mid 19th century.\nThe present building, opened in 1962, was designed by the noted &lt;a href=\"Australian\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Williams%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Louis Williams&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; for the proposed &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;Diocese&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mornington%20Peninsula\"&gt;Mornington Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; following the planned division of the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Diocese of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Although the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne diocese&lt;/a&gt; remained intact, St Andrew's was completed to be one of the largest church buildings in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;; its vast and versatile space has been described as the \"Cathedral of Light\".\nSt Andrew's Brighton maintains close and historic ties with both &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Brighton Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firbank%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Firbank Grammar School&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nSet amidst an extensive landscaped historic precinct 500 metres from the Brighton beach, the land of St Andrew's Brighton is on the eastern side of New Street in &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Middle Brighton&lt;/a&gt;. The church lent its name to the other property boundaries to the south and east: Church Street and St Andrews Street. To the north, St Andrew's grounds border &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Brighton Grammar School&lt;/a&gt;, as in the 1920s the school received in trust five acres of the original ten acres of land granted to the church in 1841.\nThe main church car parking area is entered from New Street, to the north of the corner of Church and New Streets; the entry to the car park is at the site of the rustic timber &lt;a href=\"lych%20gate\"&gt;lych gate&lt;/a&gt;, built to the west of the church in 1926 in the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20and%20Crafts\"&gt;Arts and Crafts&lt;/a&gt; style and possibly designed by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Williams%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Louis Williams&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history: 1840.\nIn 1840, the first recorded church services at Waterville, as the &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt; area was then known, were held in a tent. In May 1841, ten acres of land were set aside as a Church of England Reserve in the \"Brighton Estate\" planned by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Dendy\"&gt;Henry Dendy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Binns%20Were\"&gt;Jonathan Binns Were&lt;/a&gt;. This \"Church Reserve\" site was located in the planned small township of fashionable crescents, between the outer crescent and desirable allotments that ran to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20Bay\"&gt;Port Phillip Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpening on St Andrew's Day: 1842.\nIn 1842, the first St Andrew's Church building was opened on 30 November. As the day of the opening of the first church building was dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Andrew\"&gt;Saint Andrew&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"church%20calendar\"&gt;church calendar&lt;/a&gt;, the parish was named St Andrew's. Although St Andrew's Brighton was the second Anglican church established in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District&lt;/a&gt;, following the elevation of &lt;a href=\"St%20James%20Old%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St James\u2019 Church, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; to Cathedral status in 1848 and the subsequent closure of the &lt;a href=\"St%20James%20Old%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St James\u2019 Old Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; building in 1912 and the consequent removal of the building to new land in West Melbourne in 1913-1914, St Andrew's Brighton has the longest continuous history of any Anglican church in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. The Revd Adam Compton Thomson, the only Anglican priest in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District&lt;/a&gt; at the time, opened the first building and was the first to minister to the Brighton congregation.\nGraveyard: 1843.\nOn 24 October 1843, the two-acre &lt;a href=\"St%20Andrew%27s%20Graveyard%2C%20Brighton\"&gt;St Andrew's Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, established to the north-east of the first building, was consecrated by &lt;a href=\"William%20Broughton%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Bishop William Grant Broughton&lt;/a&gt;, the first and only Bishop of Australia. The graveyard was the first portion of the existing church land to be used for religious purposes and is a rare surviving example in Victoria of a pre-gold rush graveyard. The first burial took place the following year, well before the opening of the Brighton General Cemetery in 1855, and St Andrew's Cemetery was the major burial ground for the district. More than 300 burials took place, mostly before 1860, and the graves of many district pioneers are located in the graveyard. After over 100 years of interments, the last burial took place in 1948. However, the adjoining garden of remembrance, established in 1953, remains in use. Melbourne's oldest churchyard cemetery, the St Andrew's Graveyard is one of only four remaining churchyard cemeteries in Melbourne.\nOriginal buildings.\nFirst church and school building: 1842.\nOpened on &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Andrew%27s%20Day\"&gt;St Andrew's Day&lt;/a&gt;, 30 November 1842, this small stone building, erected to the south of the present site in 1842 as No. 1 St Andrews Street, was used as a church and school. However, the north-western extension of Church Street, from St Andrews Street to the junction with New Street, isolated the southern portion of the \"Church Reserve\" from the main site soon after construction. This southern portion was not conveyed to the church in 1843 and other development took place on that land. The building seated 100 people, about 20% of the local population of 500, and was one of the first church buildings in the south-eastern mainland of the Diocese of Australia. In 1843, it was recorded that 75 pupils were enrolled at the newly established St Andrew's School, which was officially opened as School No. 44 in 1849 by Church of England authorities.\nSecond church building: 1850.\n On 29 August 1850, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Perry%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;The Right Reverend Charles Perry, Bishop of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, laid the foundation stone for a rectangular ironstone church, designed by architect, Melbourne city surveyor and St Andrew's parishioner, Charles Laing. This building was erected to the north-west of the St Andrew's Graveyard, featured plastered brick reveals and trims, was Gothic Revival in style and included a tower that was never built in the scheme. Seating 250 people, it was opened on 12 October 1851 by The Revd William Brickwood, Vicar from 1849 to 1853. In the late 1920s, the present &lt;a href=\"Vicarage\"&gt;Vicarage&lt;/a&gt; was built on the site of this second church building.\nThird church building and school house: 1857.\n By 1857, the congregation had outgrown the second church building. The parishioner, Brighton resident and prolific Melbourne architect &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Webb%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Charles Webb&lt;/a&gt;, and his partner Thomas Taylor, were commissioned to design a new bluestone church, school house and vicarage. \"King Webb\" designed the new bluestone church in the &lt;a href=\"Early%20English%20Gothic\"&gt;Early English Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style, with a prominent &lt;a href=\"bellcote\"&gt;bellcote&lt;/a&gt; surmounting the &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt;, a small gabled western entrance porch, a seven-bay nave and small chancel. Webb's building was considered \"one of the more perfect examples of a church of the period in the Colony\" and the majority of the building, including the distinctive western facade, remains a Brighton landmark.\n The ironstone church building was demolished and some of the stone used in the construction of a T-shaped school house building. St Andrew's School, originally established in the first small wooden church building 15 years earlier, continued to operate in this ironstone school building until 1875 when students were relocated to a new school in Brighton, established after the state school system was introduced in 1872. The school house was then used for Sunday School and other church activities.\nIn 1886, a north wing was added to the school house building, creating the symmetrical H-shaped building which survives today. Designed in a Gothic Revival style, the symmetrical H-shaped school house is constructed of random coursed, locally quarried ironstone and is roofed in slate. It has projecting gabled end wings, a central projecting entry porch and render detailing that includes parapets, finials, angle buttresses, window and door surrounds and gable vents. When additions were made to the church building in 1886, the altar and furnishings from the demolition of the chancel were installed in the central space of the school house. The building is currently used as a caf\u00e9 and coffee shop.\nSt Andrew's School House is of architectural and historical significance to the State of Victoria as one of the few surviving examples of Charles Webb's distinctive institutional buildings, as a rare example of a building constructed of local ironstone and as a rare surviving example of a substantial early denominational school building.\nThird church building enlargement: 1886.\n In the 1860s and 1870s, &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt; further expanded as a desirable beach-side suburb and by 1886 necessary additions were made to the church.\nLarge sandstone &lt;a href=\"transepts\"&gt;transepts&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"apsidal\"&gt;apsidal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; were added to the existing bluestone church by 'probably the best known figure in the architectural profession in Melbourne', architect &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Australian%20architects\"&gt;Lloyd Tayler&lt;/a&gt;. Built in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Victorian%20Gothic\"&gt;High Victorian Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style, and constructed of &lt;a href=\"Oamaru%20limestone\"&gt;Oamaru limestone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Webb%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Charles Webb&lt;/a&gt;'s bluestone church served as the &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; in the enlarged building.\n As the simpler &lt;a href=\"Early%20English%20Gothic\"&gt;Early English Gothic&lt;/a&gt; and decorated &lt;a href=\"High%20Victorian%20Gothic\"&gt;High Victorian Gothic&lt;/a&gt; architectural styles were not considered visually compatible, there was provision for either replacing the bluestone &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, or cladding it in &lt;a href=\"Oamaru%20stone\"&gt;Oamaru limestone&lt;/a&gt; to complement the &lt;a href=\"transepts\"&gt;transepts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1886 Lloyd Tayler interior featured elaborate woodwork in the sanctuary fittings including a large &lt;a href=\"rood%20screen\"&gt;rood screen&lt;/a&gt; and divided &lt;a href=\"choir%20stalls\"&gt;choir stalls&lt;/a&gt;, and magnificent stained glass windows in the transepts and chancel. The designs for Tayler's additions, opened in August 1886 and costing \u00a37,000 \u2013 a substantial sum for the time, were clearly influenced by the most prolific 19th century Gothic Revivalists, including &lt;a href=\"A.W.N.%20Pugin\"&gt;A.W.N. Pugin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20George%20Gilbert%20Scott\"&gt;Sir George Gilbert Scott&lt;/a&gt;.\nParish hall: 1928.\n In 1928, St Andrew's Parish Hall, designed by architect &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Williams%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Louis Williams&lt;/a&gt;, was built to the east of the 19th century school house building. This large Arts and Crafts-influenced building facing St Andrews Street is constructed of &lt;a href=\"clinker%20brick\"&gt;clinker brick&lt;/a&gt; and the symmetrical front facade contains a broad central &lt;a href=\"jerkinhead\"&gt;jerkinhead&lt;/a&gt; gable roof.\nThe exposed brick interior of the building contains oversized timber &lt;a href=\"Hammerbeam%20roof\"&gt;hammer beam trusses&lt;/a&gt; and large folding timber doors that line both sides of the central hall. All timberwork remains unpainted. The Parish Hall is used daily by numerous organizations for a large variety of events.\nFire: 1961.\nIn 1954, over 70 years after the construction of the transepts and chancel, the nave of Lloyd Tayler's grand design for the church building had not been completed, and proposals were made by the noted Melbourne architect John F. D. Scarborough to demolish the 1857 bluestone building, still functioning as the &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, and rebuild a wider nave using the bluestone facings and arches.\nScarborough's proposals did not proceed, and the 1857 nave and 1886 transepts and chancel were largely destroyed by a devastating fire on Sunday evening 19 February 1961. Given the nave timber ceiling over 100 years old, the fire quickly engulfed the building and the damage was such that a restoration was impractical, even had that been considered appropriate.\nOn 20 February 1961, the day following the fire, the renowned Australian church architect and parishioner, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Williams%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Louis Williams&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed to be the architect for a new church building.\nPresent church complex: 1962.\n The present St Andrew's Church complex is among the largest church buildings in Australasia. Using over 500,000 bricks and over 16,000 roof tiles, the versatile space consists of three major conjoined internal areas: the main church building, the Pioneer Chapel and the lady chapel.\nThe present church building, a Melbourne landmark, was dedicated on 15 December 1962 in the presence of the Governor of Victoria, Sir &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Brooks\"&gt;Dallas Brooks&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Woods%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Frank Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Archbishop%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;; other clergy and two thousand people.\nMain church.\n As it was decided to retain the west end and four bays from the &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; of Charles Webb's bluestone church built in 1857, the main section of the new church building, incorporating a new &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, transepts and &lt;a href=\"sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, was reorientated and set at a right angle to the bluestone building, so the new nave was built on a north-south axis rather than the traditional liturgical east-west.\nSir &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Maufe\"&gt;Edward Maufe&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s design for &lt;a href=\"Guildford%20Cathedral\"&gt;Guildford Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in England, consecrated in 1961, was held up as \u201can example of good taste\u201d for the design of the new St Andrew's Church and many of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Williams%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Louis Williams&lt;/a&gt;' personal ecclesiastical design ideas are also apparent at St Andrew's. Williams retained \u201cthe traditional layout of an Anglican church favoured by ecclesiologists in the 19th century and following the pre-Reformation pattern\u201d, and used a modern Gothic style for overall design with modern materials and construction methods. Williams had used this conservative approach frequently and successfully in other smaller buildings in suburban Melbourne and country Victoria.\n Williams\u2019 desire for extremely generous planning is manifest throughout the main church with well-spaced pews, a clear view of the altar, wide aisles, a vast sanctuary and a large choir and organ gallery at the rear with a spacious &lt;a href=\"narthex\"&gt;narthex&lt;/a&gt; below. The narthex's low ceiling emphasises the height of the nave and sanctuary, \"which is obvious as one enters the body of the church and the walls seem to rise in an impressive upsurge - 'an offering of height'.\"\nThe windowless recessed sanctuary wall, lit by concealed clear side windows, was originally intended to be enriched with a reredos of Venetian vitreous mosaic, \"rising towards its summit in a stirring outburst of joyous, expressive colour\". The commissioning of this large and colourful mosaic, however, was deferred and finished instead with a large cross. The sanctuary recess now features a bronze sculpture of the prodigal son by Guy Boyd below this \"temporary\" cross. The sculpture was installed in 1987, the new church building's 25th anniversary.\n The main church building, of cruciform shape with shallow transepts, has a steel frame; red autumn-tinted \"ripple-tex\" brick was used for the exterior and hard-faced \"oatmeal\"-coloured cream brick for the interior. The dimensions are spacious: the building is almost 200 feet long and the nave is nearly 50 feet high with a distinctive ceiling of golden anodised aluminium tiles. Externally, the copper &lt;a href=\"fl%C3%A8che\"&gt;fl\u00e8che&lt;/a&gt; over the crossing is nearly 120 feet high.\nThe nave of the present building, the \u201cCathedral of Light\u201d, is a vast light-filled space. Large stained glass windows and &lt;a href=\"travertine\"&gt;travertine&lt;/a&gt; piers dominate the cream brick walls; clear glass doors, placed the entire length of one side of the nave, open to the &lt;a href=\"cloister\"&gt;cloister&lt;/a&gt; garden.\nMany artistic features in the main building are the result of the close collaboration between Louis Williams and the Dutch-Australian artist &lt;a href=\"Rein%20Slagmolen\"&gt;Rein Slagmolen&lt;/a&gt; of Vetrart Studios, including the brass representations of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Evangelists\"&gt;Four Evangelists&lt;/a&gt; on the 'Polylite' pulpit and lectern panels, the copper font cover featuring a dove and vine leaves, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt;\" west window.\nUsing the German-made \"antique\" stained glass favoured by Williams, the windows in the nave are toned from quiet and cooler colours to richer and warmer colours as they progress to the sanctuary and the intended artistic highlight of the main building, the vibrant and multi-coloured sanctuary mosaic. The stained glass in the main building is non-figurative, relying instead on the colour gradation of the leadlight to imply symbolic references.\nThe sanctuary and baptistery windows are predominantly deep blues, greens and reds, while the large Tree of Life west window, by &lt;a href=\"Rein%20Slagmolen\"&gt;Rein Slagmolen&lt;/a&gt;, at the opposite end of the building, uses cool blues at the base rising to warm golds at the top of the window.\n The west window tracery was designed to suggest the branching of a tree; the impression is enhanced by the inclusion of leaf-shaped russet-coloured glass at the apex of the window and the large double-winged organ cases branching out from the \"tree\".\n The south transept features a large and richly traceried rose window above the exposed pipework of the transept division of the pipe organ; the rose window tracery, with its \"leaf-like pattern\" also provides a subtle link to the Tree of Life west window.\nThe interior of the main church building stands as a testament to Williams\u2019 intention to make the present St Andrew's nave \u201ca symphony of light and colour\u201d as distant as possible from the \u201cdim religious light of the Victorian era\u201d.\nAll the furniture and furnishings within the church building were made to Williams' designs, and represent one of the largest collections of mid 20th century ecclesiastical furniture in Australia.\nPioneer Chapel.\n The old bluestone nave built in 1857, in &lt;a href=\"Early%20English%20Gothic\"&gt;Early English Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style and typical of the work of Charles Webb, remains as the Pioneer Memorial Chapel. In 1961, in order to reconcile the proportions of the old bluestone nave and convert it to its present use as a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"baptistery\"&gt;baptistery&lt;/a&gt;, three bays of the original seven-bay bluestone nave were demolished.\n Externally, the Pioneer Chapel is linked to the &lt;a href=\"narthex\"&gt;narthex&lt;/a&gt; of the new building by a large arcaded &lt;a href=\"cloister\"&gt;cloister&lt;/a&gt; with an internal cloister garden, extremely rare in any cathedral or church in Australasia.\nSignificantly, the original west end of the 1857 bluestone church building, a distinctive Brighton landmark with its prominent &lt;a href=\"bellcote\"&gt;bellcote&lt;/a&gt;, bracketed string course, triple lancet window tracery, pinnacled corner buttresses and original main entrance porch remains as the symmetrical western fa\u00e7ade of the Pioneer Chapel.\nAs the original triple lancet west window was destroyed in the 1961 fire, the opportunity was taken to commission a mural from the leading one-armed Australian muralist &lt;a href=\"Napier%20Waller\"&gt;Napier Waller&lt;/a&gt; to complete the internal western wall of the Chapel; externally, the stone tracery remains with blacked-in stone. The Pioneer Memorial Mural depicts the \u201cpioneers of Brighton landing from Port Phillip Bay and setting about the task of building a new church.\u201d\nLady Chapel.\nThis intimate space, to the north-west of the crossing in the main church, was designed as the Chapel of the &lt;a href=\"Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;Incarnation&lt;/a&gt;. The stained glass windows by &lt;a href=\"David%20Taylor%20Kellock\"&gt;David Taylor Kellock&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish-trained Ballarat artist favoured by Louis Williams, represent \u201cthe work of Christ and His Church in the redemption of the world in all its aspects\u201d.\nThe Lady Chapel windows are among the most successful examples of Kellock's work; the repetition of the \"Tree of Life\" west window \"tree-form\" tracery within the stained glass unifies these figurative windows with the non-figurative windows of the main building and gave Kellock the basic composition for each scene.\nIn addition to the six Kellock stained glass windows, the Lady Chapel also houses a notable &lt;a href=\"dossal\"&gt;dossal&lt;/a&gt; (\u201cThe Crowning of the Virgin\u201d) and &lt;a href=\"altar%20frontal\"&gt;altar frontal&lt;/a&gt; (\u201cThere is a Green Hill far away\u201d) by &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Dean\"&gt;Beryl Dean&lt;/a&gt;, the leading ecclesiastical textile artist.\nClergy.\nMany of the &lt;a href=\"vicar\"&gt;vicar&lt;/a&gt;s of St Andrew's Church have been appointed &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;s after their ministry at St Andrew's. Since 1980, the vicars of St Andrew's have formerly been &lt;a href=\"Dean%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;deans of cathedrals&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocese&lt;/a&gt;s in Tasmania, New South Wales and New Zealand.\nVicars of St Andrew's Brighton\nAssociate clergy\nMany clergy have served at St Andrew's Brighton as associate priests. In recent years, retired clergy have also been assisting in the parish in addition to the associate priests.\nOrganists and Directors of Music.\nSt Andrew's Brighton has the longest continual musical tradition of any institution in Victoria and The Choir of St Andrew's Brighton is Victoria's oldest Choir. St Andrew's Brighton had the first locally built pipe organ in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District&lt;/a&gt;; the instrument was opened in 1843 in the first church building and built by the first Organist of St Andrew's, Peter Hurlstone. Since then, many of Australia's leading musicians have held the position of Organist and Director of Music of St Andrew's Brighton.\nOrganists and Directors of Music of St Andrew's Brighton\nOrgans.\nSt Andrew's Brighton has the longest continual tradition of pipe organs and organ music in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1843, there have been five instruments installed in the four St Andrew's church buildings, and one instrument installed in the St Andrew's School House building between 1876 and 1879.\n1843: Peter Hurlstone, Melbourne\nIn 1843, the first pipe organ in the earliest St Andrew's building was the first locally-built pipe organ in what is now the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;State of Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and only the third pipe organ to be heard in a public building in south-eastern mainland Australia. It was built by the first Organist of St Andrew's, Peter Hurlstone. Hurlstone had also assembled the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District's&lt;/a&gt; earlier two pipe organs in the previous year. The Hurlstone instrument was moved to the second church building in 1850 and repaired in 1855 by Henry Smith, from the Bristol firm of John Smith &amp; Sons, resident in Melbourne at the time. In 1855 and 1856, the instrument was again repaired and also enlarged by English immigrant organ builder Jesse Biggs. It is almost certain that this instrument survives, in its enlarged form, in St Luke's Lutheran Church, &lt;a href=\"Cavendish%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Cavendish&lt;/a&gt;.\n1857: Jesse Biggs, Melbourne\nIn 1857, the 1843 Hurlstone instrument, having been moved again, this time into the third church building, was sold. The proceeds were used to purchase a completely new instrument built by Jesse Biggs in 1857. On Monday 23 November 1857, &lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20newspaper\"&gt;The Age newspaper&lt;/a&gt; reported \u2018Organ Performance. On Wednesday last [18 November 1857] Mr W.B. Wray, late organist of the Blind Asylum, Liverpool, gave a selection of music by the great composers on the new and beautiful instrument just finished by Mr Biggs, at his manufactory, in Little Lonsdale street, west. Several of our leading musical connoisseurs were present by invitation and expressed themselves highly delighted with the power and tone of the organ, as well as with the masterly performance of the organist. The instrument reflects the highest credit on the builder, and we must congratulate the good people of Brighton on becoming its possessors. Mr Wray, we believe, was induced to come to this colony for the benefit of his health, and we sincerely hope he may be induced to remain. An organist and teacher of his reputation would be an immense acquisition to this metropolis, particularly as our churches are now becoming fitted with organs of magnitude and first rate quality.\u2019\n1860: Hill &amp; Son, London\nIn 1860, the 1857 Biggs instrument was sold and a chamber organ, built by the leading London organ building firm of Hill &amp; Son for a local residence in 1858, was purchased following an auction of the first owner's property. Placed originally in a gallery at the west end of the church, surviving today as the west end of the Pioneer Chapel, the Hill &amp; Son organ was moved to a new organ chamber in the new &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. The instrument was too small for the enlarged building and, although other instruments were considered over the following decades, it was not until 1918 that it was finally an \u2018urgent necessity\u2019 the Hill &amp; Son instrument be replaced. The opportunity was taken to dedicate the planned new instrument as a memorial to &lt;a href=\"parishioners\"&gt;parishioners&lt;/a&gt; from St Andrew's who had died in the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. The Hill &amp; Son organ survives, in basically original condition, in St Peter's Lutheran Church, &lt;a href=\"Stawell%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Stawell&lt;/a&gt;.\n1923: W.L. Roberts, Melbourne and Adelaide\nAlthough a contract was signed with the leading Australian organ building firm of &lt;a href=\"J.%20E.%20Dodd\"&gt;J. E. Dodd&lt;/a&gt; for a large three-manual organ in July 1920, this contract was cancelled by St Andrew's in October 1922 after a significant delay in the planned building of the instrument. In January 1923, the contract was signed for a new Memorial Organ with the Australian organ building firm of William Leopold Roberts. This large three-manual instrument was dedicated in 1924 and designed by the Organist of St Andrew's: George L. Talbot, who acted as Consultant for the project. It was placed in matching divided cases of Tasmanian oak, designed by architect Louis R. Williams, on either side of the large south &lt;a href=\"transept\"&gt;transept&lt;/a&gt; window. The organ console was placed in the former organ chamber to the south side of the &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe instrument was of note as one of the largest instruments built by W.L. Roberts. The wooden pipework was locally manufactured, but the metal pipework was imported from the UK: the reed stops from Proctors of Leeds, and all the metal flue stops from Rogers of Leeds. Roberts had trained with J.J. Binns of Leeds and was familiar with the high-quality work of these trade pipework suppliers. The instrument had &lt;a href=\"tubular-pneumatic\"&gt;tubular-pneumatic&lt;/a&gt; key, coupler and stop action together with a full manual key compass of 61 notes and a full pedal key compass of 32 notes.\nAfter nearly four decades of regular use, this instrument was completely destroyed in the fire of 19 February 1961.\nSpecification of the 1923 Memorial Organ (W.L. Roberts, Ltd: 1923)\nWar Memorial Grand Organ.\n1962-64: Davis &amp; Laurie, Melbourne\nFollowing the devastating fire in February 1961 which destroyed the third church building and previous Memorial Organ, the new four-manual War Memorial Grand Organ, designed by the Organist of St Andrew's: Ian L. Thomas, was dedicated on Easter Day 1964 in the newly rebuilt \u2018Cathedral of Light\u2019. It has been played almost daily ever since for services, concerts, weddings, funerals, lessons and recordings.\nAustralian-made between 1962 and 1964 by the Melbourne firm of Davis &amp; Laurie, the instrument is a memorial to &lt;a href=\"Australians\"&gt;Australians&lt;/a&gt; killed in the 20th century's two &lt;a href=\"World%20Wars\"&gt;World Wars&lt;/a&gt;. There are nearly 3,000 pipes and 64 speaking stops speaking into \u2018one of the most beautiful acoustics\u2019 in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. One of Australasia's landmark musical instruments, at the time of its opening the War Memorial Grand Organ aroused much attention as one of the most exciting new instruments in Australasia. It was the subject of many enthusiastic reviews both around Australasia and internationally.\nThe organ is one of very few in the world with twin four-manual consoles. It also has a full-length 32\u2019 wooden reed: the \u2018Contra Bombarde\u2019. Contemporaneous with the large locally-built instrument in &lt;a href=\"St%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; opened three months after the War Memorial Grand Organ, the instrument was the first in Australasia to have a horizontal reed stop \u2018en chamade\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Festal Trumpet\u2019. The Gallery and Transept divisions are over 100 feet apart, giving inspirational \u2018stereo\u2019 antiphonal effects.\nSpecification of the War Memorial Grand Organ (Davis &amp; Laurie: 1962-64)\nElectro-pneumatic and electro-mechanical key, coupler and stop action. Compass: 61/32. 64 levels of adjustable General and Divisional memory."
