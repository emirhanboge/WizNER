    "text": "The \u0150sz\u00f6d speech () was a speech &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Gyurcs%C3%A1ny\"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny&lt;/a&gt; delivered to the 2006 &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (MSZP) congress in &lt;a href=\"Balaton%C5%91sz%C3%B6d\"&gt;Balaton\u0151sz\u00f6d&lt;/a&gt;. Though the May congress was confidential, Gyurcs\u00e1ny's address was leaked and broadcast by \"&lt;a href=\"Magyar%20R%C3%A1di%C3%B3\"&gt;Magyar R\u00e1di\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;\" on Sunday, 17 September 2006, igniting a &lt;a href=\"2006%20protests%20in%20Hungary\"&gt;nationwide political crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberally using vulgar language, Gyurcs\u00e1ny criticized the MSZP for misleading the electorate and said that its &lt;a href=\"coalition%20government\"&gt;coalition government&lt;/a&gt; had enacted no significant measures over its tenure. The mass protests the speech's release precipitated are considered a major turning point in Hungary's post-&lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; political history. MSZP's inability to contain the speech's political fallout led to the popular collapse of MSZP and, more broadly considered, of the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"Left-wing%20politics\"&gt;political left&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for &lt;a href=\"Fidesz\"&gt;Fidesz&lt;/a&gt;'s supermajority victory in the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010\"&gt;2010 Hungarian parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nExcerpts from the speech with their translations.\nProfane excerpts.\nNot only the content but also the &lt;a href=\"profanity\"&gt;profanity&lt;/a&gt; of the speech has been heavily criticized. In response to the criticism concerning the profanity, Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny stated that \"these words were the words of objurgation, &lt;a href=\"passion%20%28emotion%29\"&gt;passion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"love\"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"\").\nWhile giving the speech, he used \u2013 among others \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; word \"szar\" (i.e., &lt;a href=\"shit\"&gt;shit&lt;/a&gt;) or its related terms (, , etc.) eight times and the word \"\" (i.e., &lt;a href=\"bitch%20%28insult%29\"&gt;bitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"whore\"&gt;whorish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fuck\"&gt;fuck&lt;/a&gt;ing) seven times. The following table presents some of the profane remarks \u2013 of which not everything has been translated by the foreign (i.e., non-Hungarian) &lt;a href=\"publishing\"&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; in general \u2013 with their corresponding translations. Although 'fucking country' is the best idiomatic translation because of the strength of the words, \"kurva orsz\u00e1g\" literally means 'whore country', and the connotations of immorality, unprincipled pursuit of money and therefore corruption are very strong in Hungarian.\nOther excerpts.\n&lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Orb%C3%A1n\"&gt;Viktor Orb\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, then-chairman of &lt;a href=\"Fidesz\"&gt;Fidesz&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Gyurcs%C3%A1ny\"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny&lt;/a&gt; \"a compulsive liar\" (\"\") whom his party considers as \"a person who is a part of history and the past\" (\"\").\nIn addition to the excerpts above, the following table contains excerpts from the speech for which &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Gyurcs%C3%A1ny\"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny&lt;/a&gt; has received heavy criticism."
