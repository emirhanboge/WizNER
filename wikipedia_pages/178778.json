    "text": "Islamic fundamentalism has been defined as a puritanical, &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20revival\"&gt;revivalist&lt;/a&gt;, and reform movement of &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; who aim to return to the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20holy%20books\"&gt;founding scriptures of Islam&lt;/a&gt;. Islamic fundamentalists are of the view that &lt;a href=\"Muslim-majority%20countries\"&gt;Muslim-majority countries&lt;/a&gt; should return to the fundamentals of an &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20state\"&gt;Islamic state&lt;/a&gt; that truly shows the essence of the system of Islam, in terms of its socio-politico-economic system. Islamic fundamentalists favor \"a literal and originalist interpretation\" of the primary sources of Islam (the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hadith\"&gt;Hadith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sunnah\"&gt;Sunnah&lt;/a&gt;), seek to eliminate (what they perceive to be) \"&lt;a href=\"Fasad\"&gt;corrupting&lt;/a&gt;\" non-Islamic influences from every part of their lives, and see \"Islamic fundamentalism\" as a pejorative term used by outsiders for &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20revival\"&gt;Islamic revival&lt;/a&gt;ism and Islamic activism.\nDefinitions and descriptions.\nDefinitions vary as to what Islamic fundamentalism exactly is and how, if at all, it differs from &lt;a href=\"Islamism\"&gt;Islamism&lt;/a&gt; (or political Islam) or &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20revivalism\"&gt;Islamic revivalism&lt;/a&gt;. The term fundamentalism has been deemed \"misleading\" by those who suggest that all mainstream Muslims believe in the literal divine origin and perfection of the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; and are therefore \"fundamentalists\", and others who believe it is a term that is used by outsiders in order to describe perceived trends within Islam. Professor of religious studies at &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20University\"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Esposito\"&gt;John L. Esposito&lt;/a&gt; have criticised the term \"Islamic Fundamentalism\" due to its ambigous nature; as well as due to its usage being heavily influenced through a Western lens of &lt;a href=\"Protestantism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Presuppositional%20apologetics\"&gt;Christian presuppositions&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the more appropriate terms would be \"&lt;a href=\"Islamic%20revival\"&gt;Islamic revival&lt;/a&gt;ism\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Islamic%20activism\"&gt;Islamic activism&lt;/a&gt;\", since the traditions of \"&lt;a href=\"Tajdid\"&gt;Tajdid&lt;/a&gt;\" (revival) and \"&lt;a href=\"Islah\"&gt;Islah&lt;/a&gt;\" (reform) are rooten within the Islamic religious history, from the early Islamic centuries to the contemporary times. During the 1990s, the &lt;a href=\"post-Soviet%20states\"&gt;post-Soviet states&lt;/a&gt; borrowed the Western Rhetoric of \"Islamic fundamentalism\" and used it as a synonym for \"&lt;a href=\"Wahhabism%23Etymology\"&gt;Wahhabism&lt;/a&gt;\"; another widely abused label by authoritarian governments.\nSome exemplary Islamic fundamentalists include &lt;a href=\"Sayyid%20Qutb\"&gt;Sayyid Qutb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Saud\"&gt;Ibn Saud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mawdudi\"&gt;Abul Ala Mawdudi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Israr%20Ahmed\"&gt;Israr Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wahhabi%20movement\"&gt;Wahhabi movement&lt;/a&gt; and its funding by Saudi Arabia is often described as being responsible for the popularity of contemporary Islamic fundamentalism. From this specific regional context, islamic fundamentalism can be seen as a branch of the far-right.\nDifferences with Islamism.\nAccording to Roy distinctions between Fundamentalism and Islamism (or at least pre-1990 Islamism) are in the fields of:\nTypes.\nIslamic fundamentalism (at least among &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Muslims) traditionally tends to fall into \"traditionalist\" and \"reformist\" tendencies:\nControversy.\nCriticism of the term.\nThe term \"Islamic fundamentalism\" has been criticized by &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Lewis\"&gt;Bernard Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaled%20Abou%20El%20Fadl\"&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Berman\"&gt;Eli Berman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Esposito\"&gt;John Esposito&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Many have proposed replacing it with another term, such as \"puritanical\", \"Islamic revivalism\" or \"activism\", and \"radical Islam\".\nLewis, a leading historian of Islam, believes that although \"the use of this term is established and must be accepted\":\nJohn Esposito has attacked the term for its association \"with political &lt;a href=\"activism\"&gt;activism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"extremism\"&gt;extremism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fanaticism\"&gt;fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"anti-Americanism\"&gt;anti-Americanism&lt;/a&gt;,\" saying \"I prefer to speak of Islamic revivalism and Islamic activism.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Khaled%20Abou%20El%20Fadl\"&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl&lt;/a&gt; of UCLA, a critic of those who are called Islamic Fundamentalists, also finds fault with the term because:\n&lt;a href=\"Eli%20Berman\"&gt;Eli Berman&lt;/a&gt; argues that \"radical Islam\" is a better term for many post-1920s movements starting with the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, because these movements are seen as practicing \"unprecedented &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20extremism\"&gt;extremism&lt;/a&gt;\", thus, they do not qualify as movements which are returning to the practice of historic fundamentals.\nDefense.\nIn contrast, American author Anthony J. Dennis accepts the widespread usage and relevance of the term and calls Islamic fundamentalism \"more than a religion today, it is a worldwide movement.\" He notes the intertwining of social, religious and political goals found within the movement and states that Islamic fundamentalism \"deserves to be seriously studied and debated from a secular perspective as a revolutionary ideology.\"\nAt least two Muslim academics, Syrian philosopher &lt;a href=\"Sadiq%20Jalal%20al-Azm\"&gt;Sadiq Jalal al-Azm&lt;/a&gt; and Egyptian philosopher &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Hanafi\"&gt;Hassan Hanafi&lt;/a&gt;, have defended the use of the phrase. Surveying the doctrines of the new Islamic movements, Al-Azm found them to consist of \"an immediate return to Islamic 'basics' and 'fundamentals'.\u00a0... It seems to me quite reasonable that calling these Islamic movements 'Fundamentalist' (and in the strong sense of the term) is adequate, accurate, and correct.\"\nHassan Hanafi reached the same conclusion: \"It is difficult to find a more appropriate term than the one recently used in the West, 'fundamentalism,' to cover the meaning of what we name Islamic awakening or revival.\"\nStudy.\nIn 1988, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, backed by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, launched &lt;a href=\"The%20Fundamentalism%20Project\"&gt;The Fundamentalism Project&lt;/a&gt;, devoted to researching fundamentalism in the worlds major religions, &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucianism&lt;/a&gt;. It defined fundamentalism as \"approach, or set of strategies, by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their distinctive identity as a people or group ... by a selective retrieval of doctrines, beliefs, and practices from a sacred past.\" A 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin f\u00fcr Sozialforschung finds that Islamic fundamentalism is widespread among European Muslims with the majority saying religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam. A recent study shows that some European Muslims perceive Western governments as inherently hostile towards Islam as a source of identity. This perception, however, declined significantly after the emergence of ISIS, especially among young and educated European Muslims.\nOrigins.\nThe modern Islamic fundamentalist movements have their origins in the late 19th century. According to the Arab poet &lt;a href=\"Adunis\"&gt;Adunis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20world\"&gt;Islamic World&lt;/a&gt; experienced an influx of European ideas, values and thoughts during the late nineteenth-century. The thinkers in the Muslim world reacted to modernity in three major ways. &lt;a href=\"Secularism\"&gt;Secularists&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Mirza%20Aqa%20Khan%20Kermani\"&gt;Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal Ataturk&lt;/a&gt;, etc considered Islam to be responsible for the backwardness of Muslims; gradually abandoning religion and adopted Western ideas. Meanwhile, Modernists like &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Abduh\"&gt;Muhammad Abduh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; advocated reforms to reconcile with modernity; while emphasizing adherence to basic Islamic ideals. A third current; widely known as Islamic fundamentalism, pioneered by &lt;a href=\"Rashid%20Rida\"&gt;Rashid Rida&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20world\"&gt;Arab world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abul%20A%27la%20Maududi\"&gt;Abul A'ala Mawdudi&lt;/a&gt; (1903-1979 C.E) in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;, asserted that &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; is relevant for all times and must reign supreme. They idealised the era of &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Companions%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt;, and sought to revive its \u201cpurity\u201d and &lt;a href=\"Rashidun%20Caliphate\"&gt;early Islamic power&lt;/a&gt;. For them, the economic, political and military problems of the Islamic World are due to Muslim negligence in strictly adhering to the tenets of \"&lt;a href=\"sharia\"&gt;sharia&lt;/a&gt;\". \nThe trajectory of Islamic fundamentalism was marked by four phases. The first phase of proto-fundamentalism emerged during the late 19th century in wake of backlash against the Western colonial onslaught. Its main representatives were the \"&lt;a href=\"Ulama\"&gt;ulema&lt;/a&gt;\" of \"&lt;a href=\"Ahl-i%20Hadith\"&gt;Ahl-i Hadith&lt;/a&gt;\" movement in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; and religious revivalists of the &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Salafi%20movement\"&gt;Salafiyya&lt;/a&gt;\" and various &lt;a href=\"anti-colonial\"&gt;anti-colonial&lt;/a&gt; trends. The anti-colonial religious activists were consisted of two factions: the &lt;a href=\"Islah\"&gt;reformists&lt;/a&gt; who kept to scriptural religious discourse, and &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20modernism\"&gt;modernists&lt;/a&gt; who campaigned to adopt Western ideals and institutions. The religious endeavours of the Syrian-Egyptian &lt;a href=\"Salafi%20movement\"&gt;Salafi&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Rashid%20Rida\"&gt;Rashid Rida&lt;/a&gt; (1865-1935 C.E) marks the transition from proto-fundamentalism to the second phase of Islamic fundamentalism. Rida became the first major &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Islamic%20theology\"&gt;theologian&lt;/a&gt; to comprehensively elucidate the foundational principles of an &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20state\"&gt;Islamic state&lt;/a&gt; in its modern iteration, and these doctrines would be readily adopted by later Islamic fundamentalists. The &lt;a href=\"Wahhabi\"&gt;Wahhabi&lt;/a&gt; movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that began in the 18th century, had also gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, Rashid Rida would be highly influenced by the Hanbali puritanical and revivalist doctrines of the 13th century &lt;a href=\"Hanbali\"&gt;Hanbalite&lt;/a&gt; theologian &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Taymiyya\"&gt;Ibn Taymiyya&lt;/a&gt; and the Wahhabi movement; and began to ardently campaign against Western influence and modernist ideas. The ideas of Rashid Rida, who is widely regarded as the spiritual father of the \"Salafiyya\" movement, marks the rise of Islamic fundamentalist movements. He advocated fundamentalist causes through the early Islamic journal \"&lt;a href=\"Al-Man%C4%81r%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Al-Manar&lt;/a&gt;\" that operated for about thirty-five years and popularised his political theory of Islamic state after the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;; as an alternative model against rising currents of &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. Influenced by Rida's ideals that campaigned for the establishment of an Islamic state in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Abolition%20of%20the%20Caliphate\"&gt;abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate&lt;/a&gt;, popular Islamist movements such as the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamaat-e-Islami\"&gt;Jamaat-e Islami&lt;/a&gt; carried the banner of fundamentalism during the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt;. The Brothers incorporated the \"Salafiyya\" message into a comprehensive political programme, while the Jama\u02bfat envisioned an all-out battle against Western influence and culture. The combination of religion and politics offered by these movements established contemporary Islamic fundamentalism.\nThe emergence of the next phase occured in the context of the &lt;a href=\"Decolonialisation\"&gt;de-colonialisation&lt;/a&gt; era following the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, during which Islamic fundamentalists were persecuted by authoritarian regimes and became radicalized. The radical new teachings were epitomized in the treatises of &lt;a href=\"Egyptians\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Islamism\"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Sayyid%20Qutb\"&gt;Sayyid Qutb&lt;/a&gt;, which elucidated notions such as the return of the \"&lt;a href=\"Jahiliyyah\"&gt;Jahiliyya&lt;/a&gt;\" (pre-Islamic barbarity). Influenced by Qutb, a number of vanguard groups sprang up which turned to violence and terror in their struggle against \"apostate\" regimes. In &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, a radical &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shi\u02bfa&lt;/a&gt; combination of &lt;a href=\"Ruhollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s doctrine of \"&lt;a href=\"Guardianship%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Jurist\"&gt;wilayat-i faqih&lt;/a&gt;\" (guardianship of the jurist) and &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Shariati\"&gt;\u02bfAli Shari\u02bfati&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s modernist social reinterpretations of the \"&lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Qur\u2019an&lt;/a&gt;\" would form the ideological basis of the 1979 &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Revolution\"&gt;Iranian revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; governments, particularly those of the United States and the United Kingdom, launched covert and overt campaigns to encourage and strengthen fundamentalist groups in the Middle East and southern Asia. These groups were seen as a hedge against potential expansion by the Soviet Union, and as a means to prevent the growth of nationalistic movements that were not necessarily favorable toward the interests of the Western nations. By the 1970s, the Islamists had become important allies in supporting governments, such as Egypt, which were friendly to U.S. interests. By the late 1970s, however, some fundamentalist groups had become militaristic leading to threats and changes to existing regimes. The &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20revolution\"&gt;overthrow of the Shah in Iran&lt;/a&gt; and rise of the &lt;a href=\"Ayatollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most significant signs of this shift. Subsequently, fundamentalist forces in &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; caused a &lt;a href=\"Algerian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, caused a near-civil war in Egypt, and caused the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War\"&gt;Soviet occupation in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the contemporary era, the term \"fundamentalism\" is usually applied to denote these &lt;a href=\"militant%20Islamist\"&gt;militant Islamist&lt;/a&gt; vanguards; although historians like &lt;a href=\"Itzchak%20Weismann\"&gt;Itzchak Weismann&lt;/a&gt; argue that it is more accurate to describe them as its radical offshoots. &lt;a href=\"Osama%20bin%20Laden\"&gt;Osama b. Ladin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al-Qaeda\"&gt;Al-Qa\u02beida&lt;/a&gt; belong to a fourth phase of Islamic fundamentalism, known as &lt;a href=\"Salafi%20jihadism\"&gt;Salafi-jihadism&lt;/a&gt;, a movement that strives to move the battle against \"&lt;a href=\"Kufr\"&gt;infidelity&lt;/a&gt;\" on an international scale; since the turn of the twenty-first century.\nMuslim critics of Islamic fundamentalism often draw a parallel between the modern fundamentalist movement and the 7th century &lt;a href=\"Khawarij\"&gt;Khawarij&lt;/a&gt; sect. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to &lt;a href=\"Takfir\"&gt;Takfir&lt;/a&gt;, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.\nInterpretation of texts.\nIslamic fundamentalists, or at least \"reformist\" fundamentalists, believe that Islam is based on the Qur'an, &lt;a href=\"Hadith\"&gt;Hadith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunnah\"&gt;Sunnah&lt;/a&gt; and \"criticize the tradition, the commentaries, popular religious practices (&lt;a href=\"marabout\"&gt;marabout&lt;/a&gt;ism, the cult of saints), deviations, and superstitions. They aim to return to the founding texts.\" Examples of individuals who adhere to this tendency are the 18th-century Shah Waliullah in India and &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20ibn%20Abd-al-Wahhab\"&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab&lt;/a&gt; in the Arabian Peninsula. This view is commonly associated with &lt;a href=\"Salafism\"&gt;Salafism&lt;/a&gt; today.\nSocial and political goals.\nAs with adherents of other &lt;a href=\"fundamentalist\"&gt;fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt; movements, Islamic fundamentalists hold the view that the problems of the world stem from &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; influences.\nSome scholars of Islam, such as &lt;a href=\"Bassam%20Tibi\"&gt;Bassam Tibi&lt;/a&gt;, believe that, contrary to their own message, Islamic fundamentalists are not actually traditionalists. He refers to \"&lt;a href=\"fatwa\"&gt;fatwa&lt;/a&gt;hs\" which have been issued by fundamentalists such as the fatwa which states that \"every Muslim who pleads for the suspension of the shari'a is an apostate and can be killed. The killing of those apostates cannot be prosecuted under Islamic law because this killing is justified\" as going beyond, and unsupported by, the Qur'an. Tibi asserts, \"The command to slay reasoning Muslims is un-Islamic, an invention of Islamic fundamentalists\".\nConflicts with the secular state.\nIslamic fundamentalism's push for \"sharia\" and an &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20state\"&gt;Islamic state&lt;/a&gt; has come into conflict with conceptions of the &lt;a href=\"secular\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; state, such as the internationally supported &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;. Anthony J. Dennis notes that \"Western and Islamic visions of the state, the individual and society are not only divergent, they are often totally at odds.\" Among human rights disputed by fundamentalist Muslims are:\nIslamic fundamentalist states.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Revolution\"&gt;1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran&lt;/a&gt; is seen by some scholars as a success of Islamic fundamentalism. Some scholars argue that &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; is also largely governed by fundamentalist principles (see &lt;a href=\"Wahhabi%20movement\"&gt;Wahhabi movement&lt;/a&gt;) but &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20J.G.%20Jansen\"&gt;Johannes J.G. Jansen&lt;/a&gt; disagrees, arguing that it is more akin to a traditional Muslim state, where a power separation exists between \"princes\" (\"umar\u0101\") and \"scholars\" (\"&lt;a href=\"ulama\"&gt;ulama&lt;/a&gt;\"). In contrast, Jansen argues that &lt;a href=\"Ruhollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; came to power by advocating the formation of a system of Islamic government where the highest level of authority is in the hands of the \"ulam\u0101\" (see \"&lt;a href=\"Guardianship%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Jurists\"&gt;Wilayat al Faqih&lt;/a&gt;\").\nIslamic fundamentalist groups.\nIslamic fundamentalist groups include &lt;a href=\"Al-Qaeda\"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Taliban\"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Sayyaf\"&gt;Abu Sayyaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ansar%20al-Islam\"&gt;Ansar al-Islam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Islamic%20Group%20of%20Algeria\"&gt;Armed Islamic Group of Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Islam%20%28Gaza%20Strip%29\"&gt;Army of Islam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boko%20Haram\"&gt;Boko Haram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad\"&gt;Egyptian Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lashkar-e-Taiba\"&gt;Lashkar-e-Taiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaish-e-Mohammed\"&gt;Jaish-e-Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jemaah%20Islamiyah\"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamas\"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harkat-ul-Jihad%20al-Islami\"&gt;Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harkat-ul-Mujahideen\"&gt;Harkat-ul-Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Mujahideen\"&gt;Indian Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20State\"&gt;Islamic State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tehrik-i-Taliban%20Pakistan\"&gt;Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tahrir%20al-Sham\"&gt;Tahrir al-Sham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hizb-ut%20Tahrir\"&gt;Hizb-ut Tahrir&lt;/a&gt; among many others.\nCaucasus Emirate.\n&lt;a href=\"Caucasus%20Emirate\"&gt;Caucasus Emirate&lt;/a&gt; is a fundamentalist Islamic terrorist group residing primarily in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Caucasus\"&gt;North Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Created from the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Chechen%20Republic%20of%20Ichkeria\"&gt;Chechen Republic of Ichkeria&lt;/a&gt; (ChRI) in October 2007, it adheres to an ideology of Salafist-takfiri jihad that seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate within the North Caucasus and Volga region (primarily the republics of &lt;a href=\"Tatarstan\"&gt;Tatarstan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashkortostan\"&gt;Bashkortostan&lt;/a&gt;). Many of their fighters are also present in jihadist battlegrounds such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout Central Asia. Many plots involving Chechen and other indigenous ethnic groups of the North Caucasus have also been thwarted in Europe over the recent years.\nAl-Shabaab.\n&lt;a href=\"Al-Shabaab%20%28militant%20group%29\"&gt;Al-Shabaab&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"the Youth\", is a Somalia-based cell of the &lt;a href=\"militant%20Islamist\"&gt;militant Islamist&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"al-Qaeda\"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, formally recognized in 2012. Al-Shabaab is designated as a terrorist group by countries including Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nBoko Haram.\nCongregation of the People of Tradition for Proselytism and Jihad (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062f Jam\u0101'a Ahl al-sunnah li-da'wa wa al-jih\u0101d), better known by its Hausa name &lt;a href=\"Boko%20Haram\"&gt;Boko Haram&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced [b\u014d\u02d0k\u00f2\u02d0 h\u00e0r\u00e2m], \"Western education is sinful\"), is a jihadist militant organization based in the northeast of Nigeria. It is an Islamist movement which strongly opposes man-made laws and westernization. Founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2001, the organization seeks to establish sharia law in the country. The group is also known for attacking Christians and bombing Mosques and churches.\nThe movement is divided into three factions. In 2011, Boko Haram was responsible for at least 450 killings in Nigeria. It was also reported that they had been responsible for over 620 deaths over the first 6 months of 2012. Since its founding in 2001, the jihadists have been responsible for between 3,000 and 10,000 deaths.\nThe group became known internationally following sectarian violence in Nigeria in July 2009, which left over 1000 people dead. They do not have a clear structure or evident chain of command. Moreover, it is still a matter of debate whether Boko Haram has links to terror outfits outside Nigeria and its fighters have frequently clashed with Nigeria's central government. A US commander stated that Boko Haram is likely linked to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), although professor Paul Lubeck points out that no evidence is presented for any claims of material international support.\nAnsar Dine.\n&lt;a href=\"Ansar%20Dine\"&gt;Ansar Dine&lt;/a&gt; is an Islamist militant group in the country of Mali that wants Shariah law in Mali. It opposes &lt;a href=\"Sufism\"&gt;Sufi&lt;/a&gt; shrines. Its main support comes from the Ifora tribe of &lt;a href=\"Tuareg%20people\"&gt;Tuaregs&lt;/a&gt;. The group is connected to &lt;a href=\"Al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb\"&gt;Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt took part in the &lt;a href=\"Tuareg%20Rebellion%20%282012%29\"&gt;2012 Tuareg Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. They destroyed the tomb of a Sufi saint which was a &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. It managed to take control of Northern Mali, and they formed a pact with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Movement%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Azawad\"&gt;MNLA&lt;/a&gt; forming the Islamic Republic of Azawad.\nIt is &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations\"&gt;designated a terrorist group&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;United States Department of State&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman rights controversy.\nSome states and movements that are perceived or claimed to be islamic fundamentalists have been criticized for their &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; record by international organizations. The acceptance of &lt;a href=\"international%20law\"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt; on human rights has been somewhat limited even in Muslim countries that are not seen as fundamentalist. &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Elizabeth%20Mayer\"&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer&lt;/a&gt; writes that states with a predominantly Muslim population, even when they adopt laws along European lines, are influenced by Islamic rules and precepts of \"sharia\", which cause conflict with international law on human rights. According to Mayer, features found in conflict include severe deficiencies in criminal procedure, harsh criminal penalties causing great suffering, discrimination against women and non-Muslims, and prohibition against abandoning the Islamic religion. In 1990, under Saudi leadership, the &lt;a href=\"Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation\"&gt;Organisation of Islamic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, a group representing all Muslim majority nations, adopted the &lt;a href=\"Cairo%20Declaration%20on%20Human%20Rights%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam&lt;/a&gt;, which substantially diverges from the 1948 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (UDHR). The Cairo declaration lacks provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Further it stipulates that \"all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic \"shari'a\"\".\nThe Cairo declaration followed years of limited acceptance of the Universal declaration by predominantly Muslim states. As an example, in 1984, Iran's UN representative, Said Raja'i Khorasani, said the following amid allegations of human rights violations, \"[Iran] recognized no authority ... apart from Islamic law... Conventions, declarations and resolutions or decisions of international organizations, which were contrary to Islam, had no validity in the Islamic Republic of Iran... The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which represented secular understanding of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, could not be implemented by Muslims and did not accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran; this country would therefore not hesitate to violate its provisions.\" These departures, both theoretical and practical, have resulted in a multitude of practices and cases criticized by international human rights groups. See &lt;a href=\"human%20rights%20in%20Iran\"&gt;human rights in Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human%20rights%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;human rights in Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taliban%20treatment%20of%20women\"&gt;Taliban treatment of women&lt;/a&gt; for specific examples.\nOpinion polling.\nIn a 2005 &lt;a href=\"Lowy%20Institute%20for%20International%20Policy\"&gt;Lowy Institute for International Policy&lt;/a&gt; Poll 57% of Australians indicated they are worried about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. &lt;a href=\"Amos%20N.%20Guiora\"&gt;Amos N. Guiora&lt;/a&gt; noted that this is equivalent to the number of Australians who perceived American Foreign Policy as a threat, he further noted that not just Muslim countries have an unfavourable opinion of the United States but a large number of western countries such as: France, Germany, Great Britain and Spain and concluded that Australia was not an outlier on this regard. The Lowly Institute claimed that the result \"raised eyebrows.\""
