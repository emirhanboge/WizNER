    "text": "Liberalism in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; is limited to &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign \u21d2 denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.\nIntroduction.\nLiberal parties were active in former &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and later in &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. After the restoration of democracy liberal factions became active again."
