    "text": "Route 24 is a limited-access &lt;a href=\"state%20highway\"&gt;state highway&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. It runs approximately from &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island%20Route%20114\"&gt;Route 114&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Route%2024\"&gt;Massachusetts Route 24&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fall%20River%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Fall River, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. Route 24 is the primary freeway access for the two towns in the southeastern corner of the state, &lt;a href=\"Tiverton%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Tiverton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Compton%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Little Compton&lt;/a&gt;. Though on the mainland, they are isolated from the rest of the state by an arm of the &lt;a href=\"Narragansett%20Bay\"&gt;Narragansett Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the main freeway connection to &lt;a href=\"Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Providence&lt;/a&gt; involves using Rhode Island Route 24, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Route%2024\"&gt;Massachusetts Route 24&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20195%20%28Rhode%20Island%E2%80%93Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Interstate 195&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoute description.\nRoute 24 starts at &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island%20Route%20114\"&gt;Route 114&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. It heads northeast and has a short concurrency with &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island%20Route%20138\"&gt;Route 138&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Sakonnet%20River%20Bridge\"&gt;Sakonnet River Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tiverton%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Tiverton&lt;/a&gt;. It continues northeast until the border with &lt;a href=\"Fall%20River%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Fall River, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, where it continues as &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Route%2024\"&gt;Massachusetts Route 24&lt;/a&gt;.\nExit list.\nExits were formerly numbered only on &lt;a href=\"gore%20%28highway%29\"&gt;gore&lt;/a&gt; signs until 2014, when a project put numbers on all signs except for at Fish Road. All interchanges in Rhode Island, including Route 24, will be renumbered to mileage-based numbers by 2020 under a plan announced by RIDOT in the fall of 2017. In November 2019, RIDOT announced that Route 24 will be renumbering the exits in Spring 2020."
