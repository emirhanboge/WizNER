    "text": "Sir Nigel Gresley, 6th Baronet (11 January 1726 \u2013 7 April 1787) was an English land-owner, mine-owner, and canal builder. Born into the &lt;a href=\"Gresley%20baronets\"&gt;Gresley&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire\"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, he enrolled at an early age in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt;. He served in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; for eight years, attaining the rank of &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, before his career was cut short due to &lt;a href=\"Rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatic&lt;/a&gt; issues. In 1753 he inherited his brother's &lt;a href=\"baronetcy\"&gt;baronetcy&lt;/a&gt;, and became owner of estates at &lt;a href=\"Drakelow\"&gt;Drakelow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knypersley%20Hall\"&gt;Knypersley&lt;/a&gt;. As part of these he owned several mines at &lt;a href=\"Apedale\"&gt;Apedale&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1775 he obtained an &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Act of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; to build &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Nigel%20Gresley%27s%20Canal\"&gt;Sir Nigel Gresley's Canal&lt;/a&gt;, which was completed in the following year and held a monopoly over &lt;a href=\"Newcastle-under-Lyme\"&gt;Newcastle-under-Lyme&lt;/a&gt; coal for forty-two years. He died at &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath, Somerset&lt;/a&gt;, in 1787.\nLife.\nNigel Gresley was born on 11 January 1726 at &lt;a href=\"Drakelow\"&gt;Drakelow Hall&lt;/a&gt; and was baptised on 29 January. The son of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Gresley%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Thomas Gresley, 4th Baronet&lt;/a&gt;, and his first wife Dorothy Bowyer, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20William%20Bowyer%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir William Bowyer&lt;/a&gt;, his family was long established in &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire\"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; and held the sixth oldest &lt;a href=\"baronetcy\"&gt;baronetcy&lt;/a&gt; in the country. Gresley joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; as a scholar on 21 February 1740 and stayed there until 1744. \nContinuing his service in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, by the end of 1746 Gresley was serving in the 24-gun &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Bridgewater%20%281744%29\"&gt;HMS \"Bridgewater\"&lt;/a&gt;, a prison ship stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Firth%20of%20Forth\"&gt;Firth of Forth&lt;/a&gt;, as a volunteer. \"Bridgewater\" transported the &lt;a href=\"Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745\"&gt;Jacobite rising&lt;/a&gt; rebel &lt;a href=\"Flora%20MacDonald\"&gt;Flora MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; to London, leaving on 7 November and arriving in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; on 29 November. Gresley, who was suggested to be a quiet supporter of the Jacobites, was gifted a &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wilson%20%28painter%29\"&gt;Richard Wilson&lt;/a&gt; portrait of her in thanks for the kindness shown to her in captivity. He was then promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; on 22 April 1748 and was appointed to serve on the 22-gun frigate &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Inverness%20%281746%29\"&gt;HMS \"Inverness\"&lt;/a&gt;, which he did until she was &lt;a href=\"paying%20off\"&gt;paid off&lt;/a&gt; on 14 November of the same year, having served only in home waters. He did not serve again in the Royal Navy, probably due to &lt;a href=\"Rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatic&lt;/a&gt; issues, and declined a posting to the 24-gun frigate &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Mercury%20%281745%29\"&gt;HMS \"Mercury\"&lt;/a&gt; in March of 1749 or 1750.\nGresley succeeded his elder brother &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Gresley%2C%205th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Thomas Gresley, 5th Baronet&lt;/a&gt; as baronet on 23 December 1753 after the latter died of &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; without issue. As well as Drakelow in &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, Gresley inherited from his mother's family their home of &lt;a href=\"Knypersley%20Hall\"&gt;Knypersley Hall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Biddulph\"&gt;Biddulph&lt;/a&gt;, Staffordshire. Drakelow was inhabited by Dame Wilmot Gresley, and so Gresley lived at Knypersley. He became &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Staffordshire\"&gt;High Sheriff of Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; in 1759, serving out his year-long term of office. In 1765 he and his family moved from Knypersley to &lt;a href=\"Worcester%2C%20England\"&gt;Worcester&lt;/a&gt; both to allow his children better access to education and to help Gresley lessen the weight of some debts, accrued from business ventures. He subsequently sold Knypersley in 1767 in a further effort to combat his debts.\nGresley owned mines at &lt;a href=\"Apedale\"&gt;Apedale&lt;/a&gt; in Staffordshire, and as an early patron of the engineer &lt;a href=\"James%20Brindley\"&gt;James Brindley&lt;/a&gt; he had him build a water engine for draining the mines there in 1752. In 1775 an &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Act of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; was passed allowing Gresley and his son to build a private &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt; from Apedale to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle-under-Lyme\"&gt;Newcastle-under-Lyme&lt;/a&gt; so that he could more easily transport the mine's products of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ironstone\"&gt;ironstone&lt;/a&gt;. The canal opened in 1776 and was named &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Nigel%20Gresley%27s%20Canal\"&gt;Sir Nigel Gresley's Canal&lt;/a&gt;; the act provided Gresley with a monopoly over coal in Newcastle, with all coal apart from that used for &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; coming from his mines and canal for a period of forty-two years. Mostly built on land already owned by Gresley, the project was profit-driven but also resulted in the price of coal being set at the same rate until the expiration of the act, greatly to the benefit of the local public.\nHaving moved at some point to &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt; for health-related reasons, Gresley died there on 17 April 1787, possibly of &lt;a href=\"dropsy\"&gt;dropsy&lt;/a&gt;, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Abbey\"&gt;Bath Abbey&lt;/a&gt; on 21 April. He was eulogised by &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Thicknesse\"&gt;Philip Thicknesse&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote that Gresley was \"a kind husband, a tender father, a zealous friend, an hospitable neighbour. He was brave without boasting, and was just such a man as &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Sterne\"&gt;Sterne&lt;/a&gt; describes his &lt;a href=\"The%20Life%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Tristram%20Shandy%2C%20Gentleman\"&gt;uncle Toby&lt;/a&gt;, to whose kindness the weak would fly for protection\". Gresley is also remembered by a plaque within Bath Abbey, and the Gresley Arms, a public house in &lt;a href=\"Alsagers%20Bank\"&gt;Alsagers Bank&lt;/a&gt;, is named for him.\nFamily.\nGresley married his cousin Elizabeth Wynn, the daughter of the Reverend Ellis Wynn of &lt;a href=\"Congleton\"&gt;Congleton&lt;/a&gt;, on 18 May 1752. Together they had a son and seven daughters:"
