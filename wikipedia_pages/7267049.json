    "text": "Wildcat Mountain is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Coos%20County%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Coos County&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The mountain is part of the &lt;a href=\"Carter-Moriah%20Range\"&gt;Carter-Moriah Range&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Mountains%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;White Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, on the east side of &lt;a href=\"Pinkham%20Notch\"&gt;Pinkham Notch&lt;/a&gt;. Wildcat Mountain faces &lt;a href=\"Carter%20Dome\"&gt;Carter Dome&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Carter%20Notch\"&gt;Carter Notch&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Washington%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt; across Pinkham Notch to the west.\nWildcat Mountain has five summits \u2014 A, B, C, D, and E \u2014 along Wildcat Ridge, which curves two miles (3\u00a0km) to the south and west. Both A, at , and D, at , are considered \"&lt;a href=\"four-thousand%20footers\"&gt;four-thousand footers&lt;/a&gt;\". B, with an elevation of , and C, at , lack the &lt;a href=\"topographic%20prominence\"&gt;topographic prominence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Four-thousand%20footers%23Prominence%20criterion\"&gt;to be considered&lt;/a&gt; more than subpeaks of Wildcat A. Likewise, the E peak, at , is considered to be a subpeak of the higher D peak (the E peak was formerly believed to be the higher of the two, and used to appear on the official list of four-thousand footers, but current topographic maps reveal the D peak to be the higher summit).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Trail\"&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which extends over from &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, climbs up from the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Mountain%20Club\"&gt;Appalachian Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;'s Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch and traverses the summits of the Wildcat Ridge, continuing on to Carter Dome.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildcat%20Mountain%20Ski%20Area\"&gt;Wildcat Mountain Ski Area&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best-known &lt;a href=\"alpine%20skiing\"&gt;alpine skiing&lt;/a&gt; resorts in &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, with lifts from the base on &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Route%2016\"&gt;NH Route 16&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pinkham%20Notch\"&gt;Pinkham Notch&lt;/a&gt; up to the D summit. The area has 49\u00a0trails on , including Polecat Trail\u2014the longest ski trail in New Hampshire. The Wildcat Valley Trail, an ungroomed &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing\"&gt;cross-country&lt;/a&gt; ski trail, leads from the summit down to &lt;a href=\"Jackson%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Jackson, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, dropping in . Cut in 1972, it is one of the best-known routes in the extensive trail system maintained by the Jackson Ski Touring Foundation."
