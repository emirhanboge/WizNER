    "text": "El Espectador (meaning \"The Spectator\") is a newspaper with national circulation within &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Cano%20Guti%C3%A9rrez\"&gt;Fidel Cano Guti\u00e9rrez&lt;/a&gt; on 22 March 1887 in &lt;a href=\"Medell%C3%ADn\"&gt;Medell\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; and published since 1915 in &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. It changed from a daily to a weekly edition in 2001, following a financial crisis, and became a daily again on 11 May 2008, a comeback which had been long rumoured, in &lt;a href=\"Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29\"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt; format (28 x 39.5\u00a0cm). From 1997 to 2011 its main shareholder was &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Mario%20Santo%20Domingo\"&gt;Julio Mario Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is the oldest newspaper in Colombia. Since its first issue its motto has been \"El Espectador will work for the good of the country with liberal criteria and for the good of the liberal principles with patriotic criteria\". It was initially published twice a week, 500 issues each. It defined itself as a \"political, literary, news and industrial newspaper\". Years later it became a daily and in 2001 became a weekly. Since then, the paper uses the slogan \"El Espectador. Opinion is news\", implying it now focuses in &lt;a href=\"op-ed\"&gt;opinion articles&lt;/a&gt;, not in &lt;a href=\"breaking%20news\"&gt;breaking news&lt;/a&gt;. This focus was kept when it regained its daily format on 11 May 2008.\nAccording to the latest \"Estudio General de Medios\" (EGM \u2013 Segunda Ola 2007 (II-2007)), \"El Espectador\" has 687,900 readers every week. It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Inter%20American%20Press%20Association\"&gt;Inter American Press Association&lt;/a&gt; and the Asociaci\u00f3n de Diarios Colombianos (ANDIARIOS).\nHistory.\nSince its foundation in 1887, \"El Espectador\" acted as a speaker for the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Colombian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, at the time opposed to the administrations of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Conservative%20Party\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; Regeneration. It was closed by the authorities several times:\nSince 10 February 1915 \"El Espectador\" has been simultaneously published in Medell\u00edn and &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. Its Medell\u00edn edition was suspended on 20 July 1923.\nIn 1948, after the &lt;a href=\"Bogotazo\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of Liberal Party leader &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Eliecer%20Gait%C3%A1n\"&gt;Jorge Eliecer Gait\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, its circulation was suspended for three days. Since then, \"El Espectador\" has had to deal with the &lt;a href=\"censorship\"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; of the then ruling Conservative Party several times. On 9 November 1949, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Cano%20Villegas\"&gt;Luis Cano Villegas&lt;/a&gt;, its director, resigned in protest for the seizure of the entire edition by the government, being replaced by his brother &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Cano%20Villegas\"&gt;Gabriel Cano Villegas&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 September 1952, its facilities, then located in downtown Bogot\u00e1, as well as the building of competitor \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Tiempo%20%28Colombia%29\"&gt;El Tiempo&lt;/a&gt;\" and the houses of Liberal Party leaders &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Santos\"&gt;Eduardo Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Lleras%20Restrepo\"&gt;Carlos Lleras Restrepo&lt;/a&gt;, were looted and partially destroyed, apparently with the tacit consent of the government. It reappeared on 16 September.\nIn 1955 the newspaper, outspokenly opposed to the military government of &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20Rojas%20Pinilla\"&gt;Gustavo Rojas Pinilla&lt;/a&gt;, publishing several articles by &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Lleras%20Camargo\"&gt;Alberto Lleras Camargo&lt;/a&gt;, with a substantial effect on &lt;a href=\"public%20opinion\"&gt;public opinion&lt;/a&gt;. In December, the government accused \"El Espectador\" of several accounting and tax irregularities, and fined the newspaper $10,000 on 20 December 1955. On 6 January 1956 the National Taxes Direction imposed on \"El Espectador\" a fine of $600,000. Its directors, who were forbidden to respond to the accusations against the paper, suspended its publication that day.\nIn order to replace \"El Espectador\", on 20 February 1956 appeared \"El Independiente\", directed by Alberto Lleras Camargo, who retired in April when the newspaper was closed for several months. It was published again in 1957 but due to an agreement by the opposition newspapers, it suspended its publication on 5 May. Five days later, Rojas Pinilla was ousted. \"El Independiente\" circulated until 31 May 1958. The next day, Jun 1, it was formally replaced by \"El Espectador\".\nIn 1964 its headquarters moved from downtown to western Bogot\u00e1, on the &lt;a href=\"Avenida%2068%20%28Bogot%C3%A1%29\"&gt;avenida 68&lt;/a&gt;, the area becoming known as \"Avenida El Espectador\". At the inauguration, its then director Gabriel Cano Villegas said: \"if \"El Tiempo\" has the best corner in Bogot\u00e1, \"El Espectador\" has the best corner in the country.\"\nThroughout the 20th century \"El Espectador\" was the main Liberal newspaper, with \"El Tiempo\", both holding an important political influence. Among its main contributors it had some of the most important Colombian journalists at the time, like &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Eduardo%20Nieto%20Caballero\"&gt;Luis Eduardo Nieto Caballero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Lleras%20Camargo\"&gt;Alberto Lleras Camargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Zalamea%20Borda\"&gt;Eduardo Zalamea Borda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez\"&gt;Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Caballero%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Eduardo Caballero Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Caballero%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Klim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Panesso%20Robledo\"&gt;Antonio Panesso Robledo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"In%C3%A9s%20de%20Monta%C3%B1a\"&gt;In\u00e9s de Monta\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20Castillo%20G%C3%B3mez\"&gt;Alfonso Castillo G\u00f3mez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Salgar\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Salgar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Editorial%20cartoon\"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt;ists &lt;a href=\"Hern%C3%A1n%20Merino\"&gt;Hern\u00e1n Merino&lt;/a&gt;, Pep\u00f3n, Consuelo Lago, and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9ctor%20Osuna\"&gt;Osuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, its publisher Fidel Cano Correa said he did not agree with former President &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe%20V%C3%A9lez\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez&lt;/a&gt;'s personal behaviour and government style, but he specified that was his own position and not the newspaper's.\nJournalism of ideas.\nDuring the 20th century \"El Espectador\" criticized other mass &lt;a href=\"media%20in%20Colombia\"&gt;media in Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, which preferred to remain silent instead of denouncing the atrocities happening in the country. In the early 1980s, the daily published several articles denouncing illegal loans and other irregularities allegedly performed by the &lt;a href=\"Grupo%20Grancolombiano\"&gt;Grupo Grancolombiano&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful financial groups at the time. As retaliation, several big companies pulled their ads from the paper, which was already facing some financial issues. \"El Espectador\" disputed accusations made against it and dedicated an editorial piece to its credibility and the credibility of the financial groups.\n\"El Espectador\" also demanded in its editorials &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20the%20press\"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt; and denounced the political censorship the independent media outlets had to deal with to avoid being closed, stating that \"\"not even in the worst times of &lt;a href=\"press%20censorship\"&gt;press censorship&lt;/a&gt; or political retaliation, some resorted to crime in order to silence the press, in one of its more noble and higher &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; functions.\" It recognized that in Colombia \"the &lt;a href=\"death%20penalty\"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; ordered and executed from the lowest social holes has become an habit, as a revenge against the work of social sanity the press is committed to.\"\" It concluded saying that \"the feeling of siege and danger \u2014on the press\u2014 would be negatively reflected on the whole democratic system.\"\nThe newspaper rejected being considered as \"subversive opposition\" and criticized Liberal president &lt;a href=\"Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Turbay%20Ayala\"&gt;Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala&lt;/a&gt;'s government, which by its words wished to \"have a totally loyal, extremely pro-government press, not silenced but flattering.\" To defend itself, the paper published 15 July 1979 a column named \"Si eso es opposici\u00f3n...\" (\"If that's opposition...\") In the same text, the newspaper declared itself \"neutral\", considering that a democracy should not be &lt;a href=\"Polarization%20%28politics%29\"&gt;polarized&lt;/a&gt;, \"because in the times we are living, newspapers are increasingly more independent from governments, more devoted entirely to report and guide according to their honest knowledge and understanding,\" adding that the \"\"unanimous, one-way, uniformed, official press is (intended) for &lt;a href=\"dictatorship\"&gt;dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;s and not for democracies... and we believe that Colombia is still a democracy.\"\"\n\"El Espectador\" also criticized, openly, &lt;a href=\"drug%20trafficking\"&gt;drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt;:\nGuillermo Cano's murder.\nAs stated before, \"El Espectador\" stood firm against drug trafficking and often published articles on related crimes.\nOn 17 December 1986, the then director of \"El Espectador\", &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Cano%20Isaza\"&gt;Guillermo Cano Isaza&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated in front of the newspaper offices by gunmen paid by &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Escobar\"&gt;Pablo Escobar&lt;/a&gt;, after publishing several articles critical of Colombia's drug barons. Cano left the headquarters around 19:00 in his family's &lt;a href=\"Subaru%20Leone\"&gt;Subaru Leone&lt;/a&gt; After he made a &lt;a href=\"U-turn\"&gt;U-turn&lt;/a&gt; on the Avenida El Espectador, one of the hitmen approached the wagon Cano was driving, shot him in the chest four times with a &lt;a href=\"Uzi\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;, and then fled on a &lt;a href=\"motorcycle\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; identified with the licence plate FAX84. Cano was 61 years old, and had been a journalist for 44 years. His murder is still considered unpunished. On December 18 1986,and September 3 1989 \"El Espectador\"'s main &lt;a href=\"headline\"&gt;headline&lt;/a&gt; was \"Seguimos adelante\" (\"We are going on\").\nThe &lt;a href=\"UNESCO/Guillermo%20Cano%20World%20Press%20Freedom%20Prize\"&gt;World Press Freedom Prize&lt;/a&gt;, awarded annually by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; since 1997, is named in his honour, for \"his courage, his compromise with independent journalism and the tenacity with which he fought for his country\", which \"are an example for the rest of the world to follow. Guillermo Cano's fate exemplifies the price paid by journalists the world over in exercising their profession; journalists are imprisoned and ill-treated every day and the fact that these crimes, for the most part, go unpunished is even more alarming.\"\nOn 2 September 1989 the paper's offices were bombed by the &lt;a href=\"Medell%C3%ADn%20Cartel\"&gt;Medell\u00edn Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. The blast occurred around 06:30; it blew the building's roof up, destroyed the main entry and affected the newspaper's production. The bomb was hidden in a &lt;a href=\"van\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt; parked minutes before it exploded in front of the main entry. The same day, 6 armed men broke into an exclusive island in &lt;a href=\"Islas%20del%20Rosario\"&gt;Islas del Rosario&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Cartagena%20de%20Indias\"&gt;Cartagena de Indias&lt;/a&gt;, and set fire to the Cano family's summer house.\nDefence of the freedom of the press.\nOn 29 May 2000 &lt;a href=\"Reporters%20Without%20Borders\"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; issued a &lt;a href=\"letter%20of%20protest\"&gt;letter of protest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humberto%20de%20la%20Calle\"&gt;Humberto de La Calle Lombana&lt;/a&gt;, on the kidnapping of journalist &lt;a href=\"Jineth%20Bedoya\"&gt;Jineth Bedoya&lt;/a&gt;, at the time working for \"El Espectador\", allegedly carried out by members of the paramilitary &lt;a href=\"United%20Self-Defence%20Forces%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (AUC). Robert M\u00e9nard, RWB's secretary general, \"\"stated that he was \"scandalised\" by this latest attack on Bedoya\"\". She would later join \"El Tiempo\".\nOn 23 August 1999, a group called &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Rebel%20Army\"&gt;Colombian Rebel Army&lt;/a&gt; (ERC) published a communiqu\u00e9 issuing &lt;a href=\"death%20threat\"&gt;death threat&lt;/a&gt;s against 21 personalities engaged in the then ongoing peace process, accusing them of \"promoting war between Colombians\". Among those personalities two \"El Espectador\" contributors were mentioned, &lt;a href=\"Alfredo%20Molano\"&gt;Alfredo Molano&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Alape\"&gt;Arturo Alape&lt;/a&gt;. On 19 January 1999, Molano left the country (he would return years later). Molano had condemned the massacre of 130 people perpetrated weeks before by members of AUC commanded by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Casta%C3%B1o%20Gil\"&gt;Carlos Casta\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, who had referred to Molano as \"paraguerrilla\". On 18 September, &lt;a href=\"Plinio%20Apuleyo%20Mendoza\"&gt;Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza&lt;/a&gt;, who had worked for \"El Espectador\" and &lt;a href=\"RCN%20Radio\"&gt;RCN Radio&lt;/a&gt;, went into &lt;a href=\"exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween February and May 2000, journalist &lt;a href=\"Ignacio%20G%C3%B3mez\"&gt;Ignacio G\u00f3mez&lt;/a&gt; received at least 56 threatening letters. In an article published by \"El Espectador\", G\u00f3mez had revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Mapirip%C3%A1n%20Massacre\"&gt;Mapirip\u00e1n Massacre&lt;/a&gt;, in which 49 peasants were killed by paramilitary militias, had been supported by members of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Army\"&gt;Colombian Army&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping a kidnapping attempt in Bogot\u00e1 on 24 May, G\u00f3mez sought refuge in the United States on 1 June 2000. He would return to Colombia one year later and become part of \"&lt;a href=\"Noticias%20Uno\"&gt;Noticias Uno&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"TV\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"newscast\"&gt;newscast&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 21 March 2003 columnist &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Garavito\"&gt;Fernando Garavito&lt;/a&gt; left Colombia for the United States, after several death threats. He denounced human rights violations by AUC, as well as the alleged tolerance on drug barons in the past by the then presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe%20V%C3%A9lez\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez&lt;/a&gt;. On 8 February 2003 &lt;a href=\"photojournalist\"&gt;photojournalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herminso%20Ruiz\"&gt;Herminso Ruiz&lt;/a&gt; was beaten and had his &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; confiscated by members of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20National%20Police\"&gt;Colombian National Police&lt;/a&gt; while he was covering &lt;a href=\"2003%20El%20Nogal%20Club%20bombing\"&gt;El Nogal club bombing&lt;/a&gt;. The incident was contempt by organizations as RWB.\nIn May 2003 the newspaper, through an editorial written by its then director &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Santamar%C3%ADa\"&gt;Ricardo Santamar\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, reported on \"interference\" on an investigation it was carrying on the alleged irregularities in &lt;a href=\"Banco%20del%20Pac%C3%ADfico\"&gt;Banco del Pac\u00edfico&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that Police intelligence officials had obtained access to a draft of the report and sent it, through the Colombian National Police director, Teodoro Campo, to the then Interior Minister &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Londo%C3%B1o%20Hoyos\"&gt;Fernando Londo\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, who was a chairman of the bank. Organizations defending freedom of the press expressed their contempt and their \"deep concern\". Campo denied any involvement, while minister Londo\u00f1o claimed the draft was sent anonymously to him.\nOn 18 November 2004, a Bogot\u00e1 court sentenced columnist and &lt;a href=\"film%20director\"&gt;film director&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lisandro%20Duque\"&gt;Lisandro Duque&lt;/a&gt; to three days in jail and a 470 &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s fine, for not publishing a rectification after a sentence for &lt;a href=\"defamation\"&gt;defamation&lt;/a&gt;, when in column published 13 April 2003 Duque criticized Claudia Triana de Vargas, manager of a film production company. Instead of rectifying, Duque wrote in a piece published 7 September that he had \"no enough evidence\" to support his criticism. Duque appealed the court sentence.\n\"El Espectador\" in the 21st century.\nPresence on the web.\nOn 29 May 1996 the then daily newspaper launched its website \"elespectador.com\". Its design format and layout have been changed several times In 2006 later added the .com to its logo, comments to the articles and user registration. Access hits to Elespectador.com grew 79% in 2007.\nOn 7 March 2008 elespectador.com was revamped, setting up four \"editions\": online, latest news, news map and print version. It also improved the registration system and the &lt;a href=\"RSS%20feed\"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;s, and added &lt;a href=\"Tag%20%28metadata%29\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"video\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;s taken from \"&lt;a href=\"Noticias%20Caracol\"&gt;Noticias Caracol&lt;/a&gt;\", newscast from sister network &lt;a href=\"Caracol%20TV\"&gt;Caracol TV&lt;/a&gt;, uploaded to its &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel. The website is built with &lt;a href=\"Drupal\"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. \"Elespectador.com\" received the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A1mara%20Colombiana%20de%20Inform%C3%A1tica%20y%20Telecomunicaciones\"&gt;Colombian Chamber of Computing and Telecommunications&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Premio Colombia en L\u00ednea 2008\" award to the best online news website in the country.\nOn April 2016, the journalist Maria Paulina Baena and the journal's opinion coordinator Juan Carlos Rinc\u00f3n released \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Pulla\"&gt;La Pulla&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Political%20journalism\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"opinion%20journalism\"&gt;opinion journalism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel.\nFrom daily to weekly.\nDespite \"El Espectador\" had been the Colombian newspaper with the second highest &lt;a href=\"newspaper%20circulation\"&gt;circulation&lt;/a&gt;, after \"El Tiempo\", the financial difficulties worsened and in 1997 the Cano family sold most of their shares in Comunican S.A., \"El Espectador\" publishing company, to &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Mario%20Santo%20Domingo\"&gt;Julio Mario Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time owned \"&lt;a href=\"Revista%20Cromos\"&gt;Cromos&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Caracol%20Radio\"&gt;Caracol Radio&lt;/a&gt; (later sold to Spanish group &lt;a href=\"PRISA\"&gt;PRISA&lt;/a&gt;) and Caracol TV. Its headquarters moved to the &lt;a href=\"Avenida%20El%20Dorado%20%28Bogot%C3%A1%29\"&gt;Avenida El Dorado&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2001 \"El Espectador\" became a weekly newspaper.\nRWB stated that \"media diversity suffered a heavy blow\" when the newspaper \"downgraded itself to a weekly.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cali\"&gt;Cali&lt;/a&gt; newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Pa%C3%ADs%20%28Colombia%29\"&gt;El Pa\u00eds&lt;/a&gt;\" said: \"\"El Espectador\" is a standard in defence of freedom, the fight against drug trafficking and corruption.\"\nSince then, their editors &lt;a href=\"Rodrigo%20Pardo\"&gt;Rodrigo Pardo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Lleras%20de%20la%20Fuente\"&gt;Carlos Lleras de la Fuente&lt;/a&gt;, Ricardo Santamar\u00eda, and \n&lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Cano%20Correa\"&gt;Fidel Cano Correa&lt;/a&gt; tried to recover the financial balance and the newspaper's circulation. As a weekly, it was published on Saturdays, with Sunday's date. Counting with the free time readers have available on weekends, \"El Espectador\" focused on opinion, investigation, and analysis pieces, recovering its circulation, influence, and earnings.\nIn 2007 Fidel Cano Correa stated in an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"Revista%20Semana\"&gt;Revista Semana&lt;/a&gt;\" that \"[the return to a daily edition] is just a possibility. We have been doing very well during the last three years, especially the last one.\" The Spanish group PRISA was considered as a strategic partner, but the negotiation failed when Santo Domingo refused to cede the control of the paper to PRISA. On 11 May 2008 \"El Espectador\" became a daily again, changing from &lt;a href=\"broadsheet\"&gt;broadsheet&lt;/a&gt; to tabloid format.\nDaily focus, supplements, and alliances.\nEvery day of the week, except Sunday, \"El Espectador\" devotes around 10 pages to a specific \"focus\": \nIt also publishes three magazines, published once in a month each: \"Autos\"/\"Motos\", \"Espacios\", and \"Discovery Health\". On Mondays \"El Espectador\" publishes a 6-page edition of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times International Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\", and on Tuesdays a two-paged &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Latinoam%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Fox Sports&lt;/a&gt; minisection. It also &lt;a href=\"Print%20syndication\"&gt;syndicates&lt;/a&gt; articles from \"&lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Business%20Review\"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Pa%C3%ADs\"&gt;El Pa\u00eds&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\nSince 2004, &lt;a href=\"Lucie%20Lacava\"&gt;Lucie Lacava&lt;/a&gt;'s Lacava Design has been in charge of \"El Espectador\"'s design for its print edition. \"El Espectador\" uses &lt;a href=\"Hoefler%20%26amp%3B%20Frere-Jones\"&gt;Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28typeface%29\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gotham%20%28typeface%29\"&gt;Gotham&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"typeface\"&gt;typeface&lt;/a&gt;s since then."
