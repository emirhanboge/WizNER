Later, Bee was a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Waynesburg%20University\"&gt;Waynesburg University&lt;/a&gt; (then Waynesburg College) where he played football, baseball, and tennis.\nBee's teams won 95 percent of their games from 1931 to 1951, including 43 in a row from 1935 to 1937. Bee holds the Division I NCAA record for highest winning percentage, winning 83% of the games he was head coach. Bee resigned in 1951 after several of his players were implicated in the &lt;a href=\"CCNY%20Point%20Shaving%20Scandal\"&gt;CCNY Point Shaving Scandal&lt;/a&gt;. LIU shut down its athletic program shortly afterward.\nBee also coached the &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team at LIU until it was disbanded in 1940.\nHe coached the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Bullets%20%281944%E2%80%931954%29\"&gt;Baltimore Bullets&lt;/a&gt; from 1952 to 1954, amassing a 34\u2013116 record under his tenure.\nBee was known as the \"Innovator\". His contributions to the game of basketball include the 1\u20133\u20131 &lt;a href=\"zone%20defense\"&gt;zone defense&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"three-second%20rule\"&gt;three-second rule&lt;/a&gt;. Bee also served as co-host of the early NBC sports-oriented television program \"Campus Hoopla\" on WNBT from 1946 to 1947.\nHis influence on the game also extended to strategies sports camps (Camp All-America), (Kutsher's Sports Academy), writing technical coaching books, and conducting coaching clinics around the world. By the time he left coaching in the 1950s, Bee had already begun writing the &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Hilton\"&gt;Chip Hilton&lt;/a&gt; Sports Series for younger readers.\nBee was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20Hall%20Of%20Fame\"&gt;Basketball Hall Of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.
