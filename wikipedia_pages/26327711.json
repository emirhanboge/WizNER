    "text": "Type 93 was a class of &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt;s built during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Marine\"&gt;Kaiserliche Marine&lt;/a&gt;.\nType 93 U-boats carried 16 &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and had various arrangements of deck guns. As with the type 81 and 87, some had only one &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK L/30&lt;/a&gt; deck gun while others had a single &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK L/45&lt;/a&gt; gun and some were initially equipped with both. In 1917 some of the boats were refitted with a single 10.5\u00a0cm gun and 220 rounds.\nThese boats carried a crew of 39 and had excellent seagoing abilities with a cruising range of around . Many arrangements from the Type 81, 87 and 93 were also seen on &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine\"&gt;Type IX&lt;/a&gt; U-boats when their design work took place 20 years later.\nCompared to the previous type 87, the 93s were longer, while the pressure hull was longer. They were faster on the surface, and unchanged at submerged. Range decreased at , to 9,020 nautical miles. They still carried 16 torpedoes with four bow and two stern tubes. Crew size was increased by 3 to 39.\nCompared to the following type Large MS, the 93s were shorter, and lighter. Their range was 980 nmi shorter, and speed was slower on the surface but faster submerged. The Large MS was intended for the deepest waters and the increased size made it more comfortable and very seaworthy.\nType 93 boats were responsible for sinking 3.201% of all allied shipping sunk during the war, taking a total of 412,419 combined tons. They also damaged 71,202 combined tons.\nList of Type 93 submarines.\nThere were 24 Type 93 submarines commissioned into the \"Kaiserliche Marine\".\nBy the end of World War I, 375 U-boats of 33 separate classes belonging to 7 general types had been commissioned. More boats were finished after the war and either destroyed or awarded to victorious nations."
