    "title": "Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium",
    "text": "The Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium is one of only six major &lt;a href=\"zoo\"&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt; combinations in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Located in &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%20neighborhood%29\"&gt;Highland Park&lt;/a&gt;, the zoo sits on of park land where it exhibits more than 4,000 animals representing 475 species, including 20 threatened or endangered species.\nThe zoo's accredited membership of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums\"&gt;Association of Zoos and Aquariums&lt;/a&gt; (AZA) was dropped in 2015.\nHistory.\nThe Pittsburgh Zoo opened on June 14, 1898, as Highland Park Zoo, after &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Magee%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Christopher Lyman Magee&lt;/a&gt; donated $125,000 (about four million dollars when adjusted for inflation) for the construction of a zoological garden in Pittsburgh's Highland Park. Like most other zoos of the time, the Pittsburgh Zoo more closely resembled a &lt;a href=\"menagerie\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt; than an actual zoo. However, as time progressed, the animal exhibits eventually became more naturalistic, and the zoo's goal became more focused on &lt;a href=\"Conservation%20%28ethic%29\"&gt;conservation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1937, the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; exhibits were built under the &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;Works Progress Administration&lt;/a&gt;. These exhibits were the zoo's first attempt at constructing more naturalistic exhibits instead of simply displaying animals in cages. In 1949, the Children's Zoo opened with a grant from the &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Scaife%20Foundation\"&gt;Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The Children's Zoo contained interactive exhibits and play areas for children, including a simulated large chunk of &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; that was inhabited by dozens of live &lt;a href=\"mouse\"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;. In 1967, the AquaZoo, a large &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, opened to the public. At the time of its completion, the AquaZoo was the only aquarium in Pennsylvania and the second largest aquarium in the United States.\nIn 1980, the zoo's Master Plan was put into effect. This plan called for extensive renovations and the construction of more naturalistic exhibits. The Asian Forest, which opened in 1983, was the first area of the zoo that utilized this new philosophy of naturalistic exhibits. The African Savanna was the next area to obtain naturalistic exhibits when it was completed in 1987. 1991 marked the opening of the Tropical Forest, a five-acre indoor rain forest showcasing about 16 species of primate and 150 tropical plant species. That same year, the Children's Zoo was renovated and renamed the Children's Farm. Three petting zoos were built in Children's Farm where children could pet &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, and domesticated animals such as &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn 1994, the Pittsburgh Zoo became a private &lt;a href=\"nonprofit%20organization\"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt;, still owned by the City of Pittsburgh, but managed and operated by the Zoological Society of Pittsburgh. That same year, the Education Complex was built. This new building contained five &lt;a href=\"classroom\"&gt;classroom&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, and a 300-seat &lt;a href=\"lecture%20hall\"&gt;lecture hall&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of this building was an important part of the zoo's history because it signified the zoo's dedication to conservation and &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, the AquaZoo underwent a $17.4 million renovation, and was renamed the PPG Aquarium. This new aquarium is twice the size of the original AquaZoo. In 2002, the Education Complex was expanded to include a second story, providing more classrooms, teacher resource areas, and an animal holding area. This expansion was made possible by the Scaife Charitable Foundation and by donations from senator &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Santorum\"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 19, 2002, &lt;a href=\"elephant\"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt; keeper Mike Gatti was killed by one of the zoo's elephants. Gatti, 46, was killed while attempting to encourage the elephant to move to a different part of her enclosure. She butted him with her head, crushing him against the ground and killing him instantly. This was the first instance of a human fatality at the zoo, although there had been injuries.\nIn 2006, the Pittsburgh Zoo completed Water's Edge, a marine exhibit that allows guests to have close encounters with polar bears, sea otters, and sand tiger sharks.\nOn November 4, 2012, a two-year-old boy, Maddox Derkosh, who had been sitting on the railing of the &lt;a href=\"African%20wild%20dog\"&gt;African wild dog&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, fell off the railing, bounced off protective netting, and fell into the enclosure, resulting in his death. The medical examiner subsequently determined that Maddox was killed by the 11 dogs that attacked him, not by the fall. Zookeepers immediately rushed to the area, firing darts to try and scare the dogs off, and police shot one particularly aggressive dog, which had refused to retreat from the exhibit when called. The other dogs were quarantined for thirty days but there were no plans to put them down. The prosecutor, &lt;a href=\"Allegheny%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Allegheny County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"District%20Attorney\"&gt;District Attorney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Zappala\"&gt;Stephen Zappala&lt;/a&gt;, calling the incident a \"tragic accident\", has stated he will not charge Maddox's mother, Elizabeth Derkosh, 34, who had lifted the visually impaired boy up on top of the railing to get a better view. He is still investigating whether the zoo is at fault due to any possible negligence. Since the incident, the zoo replaced the wild dogs with cheetahs. As a result of his death, Trucks for Maddox was created, to donate Maddox's toy trucks to children. It was also the second human fatality at the zoo.\nExhibits.\nThe Pittsburgh Zoo is divided into eight sections, each of which focuses on a particular theme.\nKid's Kingdom.\nKid's Kingdom opened in 1949, when it was then simply called Children's Zoo. In 1994 a naming contest was implemented for a new name to the newly expanded area, the name was from winner Adam Mellinger from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. This section of the zoo is an &lt;a href=\"interactivity\"&gt;interactive&lt;/a&gt; children's area, and contains a &lt;a href=\"petting%20zoo\"&gt;petting zoo&lt;/a&gt; stocked with &lt;a href=\"domestication\"&gt;domesticated animals&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt; house; a &lt;a href=\"playground\"&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt;; and several exhibits featuring &lt;a href=\"wildlife\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20river%20otter\"&gt;river otter&lt;/a&gt;s including a &lt;a href=\"sea%20lion\"&gt;sea lion&lt;/a&gt; exhibit.\nKid's Kingdom contains many interactive exhibits, such as the &lt;a href=\"meerkat\"&gt;meerkat&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, which contains crawl-through &lt;a href=\"tunnels\"&gt;tunnels&lt;/a&gt; that gives the viewer an idea of what it is like to be a meerkat or other burrowing animal as well as a walk-through kangaroo pen. The animal yards and habitats in Kids Kingdom allow visitors to learn about animals' lives, behaviors, and points-of-view. Kid's Kingdom has been highly ranked by both Parent Magazine and America's Best Zoos Travel Guide.\nPPG Aquarium.\nBuilt in 1967 (then called AquaZoo) and renovated in 2000, the PPG Aquarium is a 45,000 square foot, two-story &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt; that presents several &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Aaquatic\"&gt;aquatic&lt;/a&gt; habitats. The aquarium's theme is the \"Diversity of Water\", and contains several exhibits that portray different marine ecosystems, including a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by &lt;a href=\"arapaima\"&gt;arapaima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"piranha\"&gt;piranha&lt;/a&gt;; a Pennsylvania exhibit, which features fish and aquatic wildlife of the &lt;a href=\"Allegheny%20River\"&gt;Allegheny River&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"brook%20trout\"&gt;brook trout&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt; exhibit, which is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"King%20penguin\"&gt;kings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"macaroni%20penguin\"&gt;macaronis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gentoo%20penguin\"&gt;gentoos&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;; and an &lt;a href=\"open%20ocean\"&gt;open ocean&lt;/a&gt; exhibit.\nForest Passage.\nForest Passage (formerly Asian Forest) contains several species from &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast&lt;/a&gt; Asia, and simulates a journey from the &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. This section features some of the most &lt;a href=\"critically%20endangered\"&gt;critically endangered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"big%20cat\"&gt;big cat&lt;/a&gt;s of Asia, including &lt;a href=\"Amur%20leopard\"&gt;Amur leopard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Siberian%20tiger\"&gt;Siberian tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as several other Asian animals, such as &lt;a href=\"Komodo%20dragon\"&gt;Komodo dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20leopard\"&gt;snow leopard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"red%20panda\"&gt;red panda&lt;/a&gt;s. This section, opened in 1983, is the result of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980, which was dedicated to create more naturalistic exhibits than what existed at the time.\nIn January 2017, the Pittsburgh Zoo's only snow leopard, Chaney, died of cancer at 17. Since then, the zoo has displayed two &lt;a href=\"Canada%20lynx\"&gt;Canada lynx&lt;/a&gt; in the snow leopard exhibit. In late 2018, several cubs were born to the pair, resulting in a larger family of Lynx. This change has prompted the zoo to rename Asian Forest to Forest Passage in light of the inclusion of a non-Asian animal species.\nTropical Forest.\nThe Tropical Forest, which opened in 1991, is a 0.5-acre indoor &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;. This building focuses mostly on &lt;a href=\"primate\"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt;s, containing 16 species in total. &lt;a href=\"Ring-tailed%20lemur\"&gt;Ring-tailed lemur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur\"&gt;black-and-white ruffed lemur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"red%20ruffed%20lemur\"&gt;red ruffed lemur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tufted%20capuchin\"&gt;tufted capuchin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"white-faced%20saki\"&gt;white-faced saki&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"black%20howler%20monkey\"&gt;black howler monkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"white-cheeked%20gibbon\"&gt;white-cheeked gibbon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Angola%20colobus\"&gt;Angola colobus&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"blue%20monkey\"&gt;blue monkey&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Hominidae\"&gt;great apes&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orangutan\"&gt;orangutan&lt;/a&gt;s all live in this building. Several other types of rainforest animals are displayed here as well, such as &lt;a href=\"Hoffman%27s%20two-toed%20sloth\"&gt;Hoffman's two-toed sloth&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Island%20leaf%20frog\"&gt;Solomon Island leaf frog&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfrican Savanna.\nLike the Asian Forest, the African Savanna is also a result of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980. Completed in 1987, this section of the zoo is modeled to give the viewer the impression that he or she is walking along a &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; in an African &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;. This section of the zoo contains &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"African%20bush%20elephant\"&gt;African bush elephant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"plains%20zebra\"&gt;plains zebra&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"black%20rhino\"&gt;black rhino&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flamingo\"&gt;flamingo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ostrich\"&gt;ostrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dama%20gazelle\"&gt;dama gazelle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nyala\"&gt;nyala&lt;/a&gt;.\nCheetah Valley is part of the African Savanna. It originally exhibited the &lt;a href=\"African%20wild%20dog\"&gt;African wild dog&lt;/a&gt;s and known as Painted Dog Encounter and African Painted Dog Bush Camp, but they were removed because of the incident on November 4, 2012 in order to ensure the safety of the visitors. This exhibit now features &lt;a href=\"cheetah\"&gt;cheetah&lt;/a&gt;s. Visitors can view them from a glass panel. The former observation platform was permanently replaced by tall protective welded fences and shrubbery.\nBears.\nThe three bear exhibits were built in 1937 under the &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;Works Progress Administration&lt;/a&gt; program, and are the oldest exhibits in the zoo. Three &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; species were displayed here: &lt;a href=\"American%20black%20bear\"&gt;American black bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spectacled%20bear\"&gt;spectacled bear&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Kodiak%20bear\"&gt;Kodiak bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2010, the Pittsburgh Zoo announced that their 28-year-old Kodiak bear, Rocky, died. Rocky was suffering from severe &lt;a href=\"arthritis\"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; in the joints between his &lt;a href=\"Vertebral%20column\"&gt;vertebrae&lt;/a&gt;, causing severe pain and limited mobility. Although the veterinary staff attempted to alleviate Rocky's pain, his quality of life continued to rapidly decline, and he had to be humanely &lt;a href=\"euthanasia\"&gt;euthanized&lt;/a&gt;. As of August 2010, his exhibit is empty.\nThe bear exhibits are currently empty. Plans exist to construct new bear exhibits, while the old ones are being used as part of zoo expansion and construction.\nWater's Edge.\nCompleted in 2006, Water's Edge is a newer section of the zoo, and is located adjacent to the PPG aquarium. This section is constructed to resemble a coastal &lt;a href=\"fishing%20village\"&gt;fishing village&lt;/a&gt;, and illustrates the ways that humans interact with marine wildlife in coastal areas. A long walk-through tunnel runs through three large water tanks containing &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20otter\"&gt;sea otter&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"elephant%20seal\"&gt;elephant seal&lt;/a&gt;s, two California sea lions, and formerly &lt;a href=\"sand%20tiger%20shark\"&gt;sand tiger shark&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAccording to Barbara Baker, the shark/elephant seal exhibit was originally intended for &lt;a href=\"walrus\"&gt;walrus&lt;/a&gt;es, but walruses are difficult to obtain. The elephant seal, named \"Coolio\", who was taken in early in 2014 replaced the sand tiger sharks in 2017 as a resident of Water's Edge. As of 2020, two rescued females have also been brought in. Coolio died in December 2019. The sand tiger sharks were moved to Florida in the process.\nThe Islands.\nOpened in June 2015, The Islands exhibit is a 22,000 square foot exhibit featuring several endangered animals including two &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20crocodile\"&gt;Philippine crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise\"&gt;Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Visayan%20warty%20pig\"&gt;Visayan warty pig&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"clouded%20leopard\"&gt;clouded leopard&lt;/a&gt;s and a playful pair of &lt;a href=\"Siamang\"&gt;Siamang&lt;/a&gt;s and their baby. The exhibit has scenery intended to provide the atmosphere of a tropical island, and includes a large area of sand with beach chairs and umbrellas.\nJungle Odyssey.\nOpened in June 2017, Jungle Odyssey is an expansion directly behind The Islands. The area displays rainforest animal species from rainforests around the world like Africa, Asia, and South America, featuring a mixed species exhibit housing &lt;a href=\"capybara\"&gt;capybara&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"giant%20anteater\"&gt;giant anteater&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as exhibits for &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fossa%20%28animal%29\"&gt;fossa&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"pygmy%20hippo\"&gt;pygmy hippo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\nOn September 12, 1999, one of the zoo's female &lt;a href=\"African%20bush%20elephant\"&gt;African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, Moja, successfully gave birth to a female calf, later named Victoria. This was a major feat for the zoo, because Victoria was the first African elephant to be born and survive in North America since 1982. Also, she was the first to be born to a captive-born mother. A second calf, a male named Callee, was born to another female named Savannah almost exactly one year later on September 19, 2000. The father of both of these calves is a bull named Jackson, who is currently the only male African breeding naturally in North America. Both Moja and Savannah became pregnant again in 2006. On July 9, 2008, Savannah gave birth to a female calf named Angelina. Moja gave birth to a female as well on July 25, 2008. This calf has been named Zuri.\nOn August 8, 2006, the zoo's female &lt;a href=\"Siberian%20tiger\"&gt;Amur tiger&lt;/a&gt;, Toma, gave birth to a litter of three cubs. This is also a major accomplishment because Amurs are endangered, and every successful litter counts a great deal. Although one of the cubs died of a heart defect in September (a female named Nadya), the other two are healthy and doing well. The surviving cubs are a male named Petya and a female named Mara.\nAnother Amur tiger cub was born to Toma on May 11, 2008. The male cub, Grom (name meaning Thunder for he was born during a thunderstorm), had been taken from his mother because Toma was not being very attentive to him. Handlers later determined that it is most likely because Toma is not producing enough milk, if any at all. On September 12, 2008, the baby cub was named after &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus\"&gt;Billy Ray Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, the country music and television star. Zoo representatives said the donors who paid to name the cub \"Billy Ray\" wanted to honor a late family member who was a big Cyrus fan. Billy Ray will likely grow up to be about 11 feet long and weigh 450 pounds, according to the zoo.\nIn 2010, three cubs were again born to Toma, and to Taiga their father. All three are doing very well at the zoo. Toma is caring for all three.\nOn June 13, 2009, a baby sea lion was born. Other recent births include two North American river otters and a pair of baby beavers.\nOn October 25, 2009, one of the zoo's African painted dogs, Vega, gave birth to a litter of nine live puppies, and one dead puppy. Vega died the next day, leaving her puppies orphaned. To help nurse and raise the dogs, the zoo found a domesticated dog, Honey, from a local shelter who had recently given birth and was still lactating. Honey immediately took to the puppies and fed them. At the same time, the zoo's vet staff hand-fed the puppies a liquid diet fortified with enzymes. Although, four of the remaining puppies died \u2013 the typical mortality rate for African painted dogs is 50 percent \u2013 the remaining five were healthy and doing well after a month. The painted dogs were involved in the death of a young boy in November 2012, during which one dog was shot, and the exhibit was closed. The painted dogs left the zoo in 2013 and are moved to other zoos."
