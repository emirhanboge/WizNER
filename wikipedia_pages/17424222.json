    "text": "Intangible Asset Finance also known as IP Finance is the branch of &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; that uses &lt;a href=\"intangible%20assets\"&gt;intangible assets&lt;/a&gt; such as intellectual property (legal intangible) and &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; (competitive intangible) to gain access to &lt;a href=\"credit\"&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt;. Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of &lt;a href=\"Value%20%28economics%29\"&gt;value&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"risk\"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasic principles.\nBusiness can benefit from unlocking value from their intangible assets, with intellectual property and other intangibles adding at least double the value to products as tangible capital.\nIn 2003, one estimate put the &lt;a href=\"economic%20equilibrium\"&gt;economic equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; of intangible assets in the U.S. &lt;a href=\"economy\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic &lt;a href=\"corporations\"&gt;corporations&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2001.\nAmong companies in the &lt;a href=\"S%26amp%3BP%20500\"&gt;S&amp;P500&lt;/a&gt;, intangibles including intellectual property account for 90% of the total &lt;a href=\"market%20value\"&gt;market value&lt;/a&gt;. \nOne of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the \"hidden value\" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntangible assets include &lt;a href=\"business%20processes\"&gt;business processes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intellectual%20property\"&gt;Intellectual Property&lt;/a&gt; (IP) such as &lt;a href=\"patents\"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trademarks\"&gt;trademarks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"ethics\"&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"integrity\"&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quality%20%28business%29\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"safety\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sustainability\"&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"security\"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Resilience%20%28organizational%29\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;. Today, these intangibles drive &lt;a href=\"cash%20flow\"&gt;cash flow&lt;/a&gt; and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, &lt;a href=\"management\"&gt;management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"risk%20forecasting\"&gt;risk forecasting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"risk%20transfer\"&gt;risk transfer&lt;/a&gt; are growing services as the &lt;a href=\"economic%20base\"&gt;economic base&lt;/a&gt; divests itself of physical &lt;a href=\"assets\"&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt;. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.\nPolicymakers have explored a variety of measures around IP-backed financing including the creation of dedicated funds; education programs to develop standards, raise awareness and promote good practice; as well as, in some cases, subsidized interest rates for loans based on IP as &lt;a href=\"Collateral%20%28finance%29\"&gt;collateral&lt;/a&gt;. It is still a relatively new policy area with both firms and governments are experimenting with how they can support IP-rich businesses to grow.\nBusiness models using IP-backed financing.\nA number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.\nGovernment, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits.\nThe &lt;a href=\"World%20Intellectual%20Property%20Organization\"&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WIPO) is the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation. It is a self-funding agency of the United Nations, with 193 member states.\nIts stated mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity throughout the world. In June 2021, WIPO released its Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTSP), which included working with its partners to catalyze international discussions on the important questions of IP valuation and finance. The organization is launching a new report series, studying country experiences with IP-backed financing. The series was formally launch on 2022.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20International%20Trade%20Law\"&gt;United Nations Commission on International Trade Law&lt;/a&gt; (UNCITRAL) plays a key role in developing progressive harmonization and modernization of international trade law. UNCITRAL does so by promoting the use and adoption of legislative and non-legislative instruments in a number of strategical areas of commercial law . The UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions promotes low-cost credit by enhancing the availability of secured credit. In line with this objective, the Supplement on Security Rights in Intellectual Property is intended to make credit more available and at a lower cost for Intellectual property rights owner.\nThe &lt;a href=\"OECD\"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD),\u00a0 is an international organization that works in establishing evidence-based international standards and finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. In addition to other topics, the organization explores the role of intellectual property rights, studies the economic impact of IP regimes globally. In 2019, it produced a paper on the use intangibles to strengthen SME access to finance. \nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards%20Foundation\"&gt;International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (IFRS) is a &lt;a href=\"Nonprofit%20organization\"&gt;nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; accounting organization, which promotes the development of financial reporting standards. Its &lt;a href=\"International%20Financial%20Reporting%20Standards\"&gt;International Accounting Standards&lt;/a&gt; (IAS 38) set out the criteria for recognizing and measuring intangible assets:\u00a0 \u201cAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.\u201d \nOn June 23, 2008, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Academies\"&gt;United States National Academies&lt;/a&gt; hosted a one-day conference in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; entitled \"Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth.\"\nThe Intangible Asset Finance Society provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.\nThe Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to\npublic education and research on the emerging global &lt;a href=\"information%20economy\"&gt;information economy&lt;/a&gt;. On April 16, 2008 it published a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.\nChallenges in IP-Backed Finance.\nChallenges in intangible asset financing include:"
