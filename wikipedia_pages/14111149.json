The station is owned by &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Communications\"&gt;Lotus Communications&lt;/a&gt;. Programming includes the &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Rebels\"&gt;UNLV Rebels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Rebels%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UNLV%20Runnin%27%20Rebels\"&gt;men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; teams, the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Aces\"&gt;Las Vegas Aces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt; talk shows and play-by-play, and various local talk shows.

These tests were mainly to arrange the nighttime &lt;a href=\"directional%20antenna\"&gt;directional&lt;/a&gt; signal of the station, so it would not interfere with nearby &lt;a href=\"KNZZ\"&gt;KNZZ&lt;/a&gt; or other stations on 1100 &lt;a href=\"kHz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt;. While testing, the station ran at half power (10,000 watts day and 1,000 watts night) to further limit the possibility of &lt;a href=\"RF%20interference\"&gt;interference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"1100%20AM\"&gt;1100 AM&lt;/a&gt; is a United States &lt;a href=\"clear-channel\"&gt;clear-channel&lt;/a&gt; frequency, on which &lt;a href=\"WTAM\"&gt;WTAM&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20broadcast%20station%20classes%23AM\"&gt;Class A&lt;/a&gt; station. KWWN is currently running at its normal power.\nOriginally, KWWN simulcast sister station &lt;a href=\"KRLV%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KBAD&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime in 2008, the simulcast ended; KBAD became the local affiliate of &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;Fox Sports Radio&lt;/a&gt;, while KWWN picked up the ESPN Radio affiliation. &lt;a href=\"KENO%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KENO&lt;/a&gt;, which had been the FSR station, joined &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Deportes%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Deportes Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nKWWN is the flagship station of the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Aces\"&gt;Las Vegas Aces&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;Women's National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt;. Before the start of the 2018-19 season, the station was named as an affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20radio%20networks\"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have a team in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt;"
