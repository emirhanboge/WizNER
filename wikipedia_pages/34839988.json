    "title": "Henry Yelverton (merchant)",
    "text": "Henry Yelverton (1821 \u2013 1 April 1880) was an Australian sawmiller and timber merchant.\nYelverton was born in London, England; his father, Edward, was a jeweller. He went to the United States aged 18, having originally planned to study medicine, and was employed by a whaling ship that took him to Western Australia in 1845. He worked near Perth, employing &lt;a href=\"sawyer%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;sawyers&lt;/a&gt; by 1849. In 1853 he was a &lt;a href=\"cooper%20%28profession%29\"&gt;cooper&lt;/a&gt; and had bought a &lt;a href=\"brig\"&gt;brig&lt;/a&gt; with a business partner to transport timber to the eastern colonies. He moved to the &lt;a href=\"Vasse%20River\"&gt;Vasse River&lt;/a&gt; area near &lt;a href=\"Busselton\"&gt;Busselton&lt;/a&gt; in 1855. In 1858 he built a steam sawmill at &lt;a href=\"Quindalup\"&gt;Quindalup&lt;/a&gt; that provided timber from &lt;a href=\"jarrah%20forest\"&gt;jarrah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuart%20forest\"&gt;tuart&lt;/a&gt; forests to the eastern colonies, &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; and employed up to 120 &lt;a href=\"convicts%20in%20Australia\"&gt;ex-convicts&lt;/a&gt;. He built a jetty, roads, bridges and a horse tramway for his forestry business, as well as Busselton's first courthouse. His company began the construction of &lt;a href=\"Busselton%20Jetty\"&gt;Busselton Jetty&lt;/a&gt; in 1864 and 1865. He was also involved in the Castle Bay Whaling Company, was licensee of the Race Horse Inn at &lt;a href=\"Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;, and smuggled tobacco for extra income. Customs officials heavily fined him for his tobacco-smuggling activities, but this did not affect his local standing; local consensus was that \"he had done much more for the district than the government ever had\". In 1865, he had exported almost &lt;a href=\"Australian%20pound\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;11,000 of timber out of the \u00a315,693 worth of the material exported in the entire colony of Western Australia. His financial situation was unstable, however; he was bankrupt in September 1862 and May 1866, and was apparently struggling financially in 1868 and 1872\u201373. In January 1880 he was seriously injured in a logging accident; he died on 1 April of that year, aged 58.\nHe married Mary Marshall, the daughter of a clerk, on 7 June 1853 at St George's Anglican Church; the couple had two sons and nine daughters. His son &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Yelverton%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;Henry John&lt;/a&gt;, who later became a state politician, took over his father's timber business after his death. It was eventually bought out by the Imperial Jarrah Wood Corporation, which was subsequently merged into &lt;a href=\"Millars%20Karri%20and%20Jarrah%20Forests%20Limited\"&gt;Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe locality of &lt;a href=\"Yelverton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Yelverton&lt;/a&gt; is named after him."
