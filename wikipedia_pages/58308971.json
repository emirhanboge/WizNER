    "text": "Van Loan Hill is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Greene County, New York&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Catskill%20Mountains\"&gt;Catskill Mountains&lt;/a&gt; southwest of &lt;a href=\"Maplecrest%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Maplecrest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Round%20Hill%20%28Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Round Hill&lt;/a&gt; is located west, &lt;a href=\"Elm%20Ridge%20%28Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Elm Ridge&lt;/a&gt; is located north-northeast, and &lt;a href=\"East%20Jewett%20Range\"&gt;East Jewett Range&lt;/a&gt; is located south of Van Loan Hill.\nVan Loan Hill is a &lt;a href=\"drumlin\"&gt;drumlin&lt;/a&gt; that was formed in the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Glacial%20Period\"&gt;Last Glacial Period&lt;/a&gt;. Its name is possibly in honor of &lt;a href=\"Walton%20Van%20Loan\"&gt;Walton Van Loan&lt;/a&gt;, a local &lt;a href=\"guide%20book\"&gt;guide book&lt;/a&gt; author and &lt;a href=\"Cartography\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"National%20Trails%20Day\"&gt;National Trails Day&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, an adjacent parcel of &lt;a href=\"Drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; land called Maplecrest Unit in the &lt;a href=\"Windham%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Town of Windham&lt;/a&gt; was opened for hiking by the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection\"&gt;New York City Department of Environmental Protection&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for unobstructed views. To view by car, the closest road to the north and east is &lt;a href=\"County%20Route%2040%20%28Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;County Route 40&lt;/a&gt;. To the south is Round Hills Road, and to the west past Round Hill is &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20296\"&gt;New York State Route 296&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Batavia%20Kill%20%28Schoharie%20Creek%20tributary%29\"&gt;Batavia Kill&lt;/a&gt; runs along the northern slope, and the tributaries of &lt;a href=\"East%20Kill\"&gt;East Kill&lt;/a&gt; lie south. The area was in the path of both &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Irene\"&gt;Hurricane Irene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Storm%20Lee%20%282011%29\"&gt;Tropical Storm Lee&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2012 the Maplecrest Unit underwent restoration work and stream stabilization."
