    "text": "El Tor ( \"/\" ), also &lt;a href=\"Romanization\"&gt;romanized&lt;/a&gt; as \"Al-Tur\" and \"At-Tur\" and known as \"Tur Sinai\", formerly Raithu, is a small city and the capital of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Sinai%20Governorate\"&gt;South Sinai Governorate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the city comes from the Arabic term for the mountain where the prophet &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; received the &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Tablets of the Law&lt;/a&gt; from God; this mountain is designated \"Jabal Al Tor\".\nAt-Tur itself appears to have been founded in the 13th century near the site of the ancient Raythou (medieval \"Raya\"). The &lt;a href=\"El%20Tor\"&gt;El Tor&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href=\"cholera\"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; was discovered there in 1905. It was a &lt;a href=\"quarantine\"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt; camp for Muslim pilgrims returning from &lt;a href=\"Hajj\"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt; (the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca).\nHistory.\nMonastery.\nThe Raithu desert is situated around El Tor, between &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Catherine%2C%20Egypt\"&gt;Saint Catherine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Mount%20Sinai%20and%20Raithu\"&gt;Archdiocese of Mount Sinai and Raithu&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Patriarchate%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Martyrs%20of%20Raithu\"&gt;Martyrs of Raithu&lt;/a&gt;\" were 43 &lt;a href=\"anchorite\"&gt;anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s (early Christian hermits) murdered by &lt;a href=\"bedouin\"&gt;bedouin&lt;/a&gt;s (desert dwellers) during the reign of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Diocletian\"&gt;Diocletian&lt;/a&gt; (284-305CE). Christian monks fleeing persecutions had been present since the 3rd century, and the Raithu monastery (or Rutho) was commissioned in the 6th century by Byzantine emperor &lt;a href=\"Justinian\"&gt;Justinian&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was proposed as a &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage\"&gt;World Heritage&lt;/a&gt; site on November 1, 1994, in the Cultural category. &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20of%20Raithu\"&gt;Theodore of Raithu&lt;/a&gt; was champion of &lt;a href=\"neo-Chalcedonism\"&gt;neo-Chalcedonism&lt;/a&gt; in the early 7th century.\nPortuguese attack.\nEn route to Suez with the objective to seek and destroy the Ottoman fleet, a Portuguese Armada was sent in 1541 to Red Sea.\nAfter several days sailing, the commander Estev\u00e3o da Gama gives the order to direct a surprise attack. The troops were able to disembark and the defenders came out to the shore but were pushed to the city not managing to close the city doors. The Portuguese as the city fell, were ready to loot, but two Priests came to the Commander, and appeal to him avoiding the destruction. Several soldiers were armed Knights after a mass, and the armada stayed for a few days preparing to sail and attack Suez.\nClimate.\nIts climate is classified by &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen-Geiger%20climate%20classification%20system\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen-Geiger system&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"hot%20desert%20climate\"&gt;hot desert&lt;/a&gt; (BWh)."
