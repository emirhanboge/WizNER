    "text": "Margaret de Audley, \"&lt;a href=\"suo%20jure\"&gt;suo jure&lt;/a&gt;\" 2nd Baroness Audley and Countess of Stafford (c. 1318 \u2013 7 September 1349) was an English noblewoman. She was the only daughter of &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20de%20Audley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester\"&gt;Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;, by his wife &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20de%20Clare\"&gt;Lady Margaret de Clare&lt;/a&gt;. Her mother was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Acre\"&gt;Joan of Acre&lt;/a&gt;, Princess of England; thus making Margaret a great-granddaughter of King &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; by his first consort, &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Eleanor of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. As the only daughter and heiress of her father, she succeeded to the title of 2nd Baroness Audley [E., 1317] on 10 November 1347.\nMarriage and issue.\nMargaret was abducted by &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20de%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Stafford\"&gt;Ralph, Lord Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, who had helped &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt; take the throne. At the time, her worth was at least \u00a32314 a year, which was more than ten times Stafford's own estates. (However, he eventually rose to &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Stafford\"&gt;Earl of Stafford&lt;/a&gt; in 1350.) After the abduction, her parents filed a complaint with the king, but Edward supported Stafford. In compensation, the king appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh the 1st &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Gloucester\"&gt;Earl of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;.\nMargaret de Audley and Stafford married before 6 July 1336. They subsequently had two sons and four daughters:"
