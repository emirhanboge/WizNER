    "text": "Kino Sports Complex is a multiple-use sports complex in &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; formerly utilized the complex's main ballpark, Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium, for &lt;a href=\"Cactus%20League\"&gt;Cactus League&lt;/a&gt; games each March and had their minor league complexes on-site. The ballpark was also home to the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Sidewinders\"&gt;Tucson Sidewinders&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; for the team's last decade in Tucson, running from the stadium's 1998 opening season to the 2008 season. The ballpark was a temporary home (2011\u20132013) to the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Padres\"&gt;Tucson Padres&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Portland Beavers) of the Pacific Coast League during the team's relocation to &lt;a href=\"El%20Paso%2C%20Texas\"&gt;El Paso, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The unaffiliated &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Mexican%20All-Stars\"&gt;Tucson Mexican All-Stars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20League\"&gt;Arizona League&lt;/a&gt; played here from 1998 to 2000. It was also the regular season home of the &lt;a href=\"Pecos%20League\"&gt;Pecos League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Saguaros\"&gt;Tucson Saguaros&lt;/a&gt; baseball team from 2016 to 2017. It seats 11,500 fans, and hosts concerts in addition to its primary function as a baseball park.\nKino Sports Complex is also used to host &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; matches. &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tucson\"&gt;FC Tucson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"USL%20League%20One\"&gt;USL League One&lt;/a&gt; plays its home matches at the complex's North Stadium, its primary soccer stadium. The complex serves as the preseason home of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Red%20Bulls\"&gt;New York Red Bulls&lt;/a&gt; and host of the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Diamond%20Cup\"&gt;Desert Diamond Cup&lt;/a&gt; preseason soccer tournament.\nHistory.\nSpring training and AAA venue.\nTucson Electric Park opened in 1998. Larger and more modern than central Tucson's &lt;a href=\"Hi%20Corbett%20Field\"&gt;Hi Corbett Field&lt;/a&gt;, it is situated 4 miles south of Hi Corbett, at the intersection of several major thoroughfares including &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010%20in%20Arizona\"&gt;I-10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20State%20Route%2086\"&gt;SR-86&lt;/a&gt;. TEP opened the same year that the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; began operations in Phoenix, and the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Toros\"&gt;Tucson Toros&lt;/a&gt; moved from Hi Corbett to TEP, renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Sidewinders\"&gt;Tucson Sidewinders&lt;/a&gt;, and became the Diamondbacks' AAA affiliate. Furthermore, the Diamondbacks themselves became a tenant of TEP for &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the facility with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; (who moved from their previous spring training facility in &lt;a href=\"Sarasota%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Sarasota, Florida&lt;/a&gt;). Across town, the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; continued to hold their spring training at Hi Corbett Field.\nMexican Rookie team.\nThe unaffiliated Tucson Mexican All-Stars of the Arizona League played here from 1998 to 2000. The team consisted of under 19 rookies from Mexico.\nDeparture of MLB spring training.\nThe Chicago White Sox had an agreement to move to &lt;a href=\"Glendale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; in a stadium that was completed in the 2009 season. However, the Sox' lease on TEP was to last through 2012. In order to leave TEP early, the Sox proposed a youth baseball academy backed by Major League Baseball surrounding TEP. On November 18, 2008 the &lt;a href=\"Pima%20County%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Pima County&lt;/a&gt; Board of Supervisors agreed to the White Sox's revised offer of $5 million, thus allowing the team to move to Glendale in time for the 2009 season. &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;, spring training occupant of Tucson's &lt;a href=\"Hi%20Corbett%20Field\"&gt;Hi Corbett Field&lt;/a&gt;, and the Arizona Diamondbacks, who were tenants at TEP and the Kino Sports Complex, indicated that they would both need Tucson to have three teams in order to continue playing there. Tucson was therefore abandoned as a spring training venue, and all &lt;a href=\"Cactus%20League\"&gt;Cactus League&lt;/a&gt; games now take place in the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Phoenix metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;. The Diamondbacks and Rockies share the new &lt;a href=\"Salt%20River%20Fields%20at%20Talking%20Stick\"&gt;Salt River Fields at Talking Stick&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 2011 near &lt;a href=\"Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeparture of the Sidewinders.\nThe Tucson Sidewinders also played their last season at TEP in 2008. The team moved to &lt;a href=\"Reno%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Reno, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, renaming itself the &lt;a href=\"Reno%20Aces\"&gt;Reno Aces&lt;/a&gt; and remaining the AAA affiliate of the Diamondbacks.\nAt the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Reno%20Silver%20Sox%20%28Golden%20Baseball%20League%29\"&gt;Reno Silver Sox&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20league%20baseball\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Golden Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;, displaced by the arrival of the Aces, relocated to Tucson. Instead of using TEP, however, the new team located itself at the more historic Hi Corbett Field and retook the historic name of the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Toros\"&gt;Tucson Toros&lt;/a&gt;.\nTEP was thus, for a time, without any Major League or minor league baseball tenant.\nName change.\nIn 2010, after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Stadium%23Corporate%20naming\"&gt;naming agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the local &lt;a href=\"electric%20utility\"&gt;electric utility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Electric%20Power\"&gt;Tucson Electric Power&lt;/a&gt;, the stadium was renamed after &lt;a href=\"Eusebio%20Kino\"&gt;Eusebio Kino&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20missions%20in%20the%20Sonoran%20Desert\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; who first explored southern Arizona in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The Pima County Board of Supervisors approved the name change (Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium) on January 18, 2011.\nTucson Padres.\nIn 2011, the San Diego Padres Triple-A affiliate relocated from &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; to Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium and renamed itself the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Padres\"&gt;Tucson Padres&lt;/a&gt;. They were formerly known as the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Beavers\"&gt;Portland Beavers&lt;/a&gt;. Originally the San Diego Padres organization wanted to arrange for a stadium to be approved and constructed in &lt;a href=\"Escondido%2C%20California\"&gt;Escondido, California&lt;/a&gt;, however that stadium plan later fell through when California eliminated their redevelopment agencies. The team departed Tucson for &lt;a href=\"El%20Paso%2C%20Texas\"&gt;El Paso, Texas&lt;/a&gt; prior to the beginning of the 2014 season and assumed the name \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Paso%20Chihuahuas\"&gt;El Paso Chihuahuas&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFC Tucson.\nSince 2012, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tucson\"&gt;FC Tucson&lt;/a&gt; has played its games at Kino Sports Complex's North Stadium. The club began its existence in the &lt;a href=\"USL%20League%20Two\"&gt;Premier Development League&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 began play in the higher-level &lt;a href=\"USL%20League%20One\"&gt;USL League One&lt;/a&gt;.\nPima Community College.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pima%20Community%20College\"&gt;Pima Community College&lt;/a&gt; Aztecs &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; played its home games at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium for several seasons. The team will move to the Kino Sports Complex North Stadium for its 2014 fall Football season."
