    "text": "The Sri Lanka lowland rain forests represents &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;Tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s below in elevation in the southwestern part of the island. The year-around warm, wet climate together with thousands years of isolation from mainland India have resulted in the evolution of numerous plants and animal species that can only be found in &lt;a href=\"Forestry%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;rain forests&lt;/a&gt; in Sri Lanka. The thick forest &lt;a href=\"Canopy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;canopy&lt;/a&gt; is made up of over 150 species of trees, some of the &lt;a href=\"emergent%20layer\"&gt;emergent layer&lt;/a&gt; reaching as high as . The lowland rain forests accounts for 2.14 percent of Sri Lanka's land area. This ecoregion is the home of the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20shrew\"&gt;jungle shrew&lt;/a&gt;, a small &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; mammal of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has the highest &lt;a href=\"Species%20richness\"&gt;density&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt; species worldwide. Many of these, including 250 species of &lt;a href=\"tree%20frog\"&gt;tree frog&lt;/a&gt;s, live in these &lt;a href=\"rain%20forest\"&gt;rain forest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nForest cover.\nThe lowland rain forests cover in total and accounts for 2.14 percent of Sri Lanka's land area. Wet &lt;a href=\"monsoon%20forest\"&gt;monsoon forest&lt;/a&gt;s receive of annual rainfall and are situated belove of altitude. &lt;a href=\"Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya\"&gt;Kanneliya&lt;/a&gt;, Viharakele, Nakiyadeniya, and &lt;a href=\"Sinharaja%20Forest%20Reserve\"&gt;Sinharaja&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, are the forests that represent this ecoregion. Bambarabotuwa, Morapitiya Runakanda, Gilimale and Eratne are some of the other forest reserves. Even rainfall throughout the year, and invariable temperature resulted in rich &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;. These forests also act as an important catchment area for rivers.\nGeological history.\nSri Lanka is a &lt;a href=\"continental%20island\"&gt;continental island&lt;/a&gt;, separated from the &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n continent only by shallow &lt;a href=\"Palk%20Strait\"&gt;Palk Strait&lt;/a&gt;. Sri Lanka was once a part of &lt;a href=\"Gondwanaland\"&gt;Gondwanaland&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous%20Period\"&gt;Cretaceous Period&lt;/a&gt;. Then as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Plate\"&gt;Indian Plate&lt;/a&gt;, it detached and drifted northward. The Indian Plate collided with the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Plate\"&gt;Asian mainland&lt;/a&gt; about 55 million years later. Therefore, there are many ancient Gondwana &lt;a href=\"taxonomic%20groups\"&gt;taxonomic groups&lt;/a&gt; present in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka first became separated from the mainland Indian subcontinent during the late &lt;a href=\"Miocene%20Epoch\"&gt;Miocene Epoch&lt;/a&gt;. Due to climatic changes, an intermittent drier region emerged between the moist forests in southwest Sri Lanka and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Ghats\"&gt;Western Ghats&lt;/a&gt; in India, the closest other moist forests. Although the island has been connected with the mainland repeatedly by land bridges since the initial separation, Sri Lanka's moist forests and its wet forest-adapted &lt;a href=\"Biota%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;biota&lt;/a&gt; have been identified as being ecologically isolated.\nFeatures.\nThe ecoregion partially encircles the Central Massif, which reach above and detached &lt;a href=\"Knuckles%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Knuckles Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt;. These mountains are represented by their own ecoregion, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20montane%20rain%20forests\"&gt;Sri Lanka montane rain forests&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Soil%20type\"&gt;type of the soil&lt;/a&gt; of the ecoregion is red-yellow &lt;a href=\"podzolic\"&gt;podzolic&lt;/a&gt; soil. The extended &lt;a href=\"Monsoon%23Southwest%20monsoon\"&gt;Southwestern monsoon&lt;/a&gt; in May to September brings more than of rainfall to the ecoregion. The temperature remains constantly between throughout the year. Due to the proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; daily temperatures are relieved by the ocean breezes. &lt;a href=\"Relative%20humidity\"&gt;Relative humidity&lt;/a&gt; ranges between 75%-85%.\nFlora.\nThe vegetation of the region is determined primarily by climate, with &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"edaphic\"&gt;edaphic&lt;/a&gt; conditions contributing secondarily. Two &lt;a href=\"Community%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;floral communities&lt;/a&gt; dominate in the Sri Lankan lowland rain forests - the \"&lt;a href=\"Dipterocarpus\"&gt;Dipterocarpus&lt;/a&gt;\"-dominated (&lt;a href=\"Sinhalese%20language\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt; \"Hora\") community and the \"&lt;a href=\"Mesua\"&gt;Mesua&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Shorea\"&gt;Shorea&lt;/a&gt;\" community (Sinhalese \"Na-Doona\"). The \"Dipterocarpus\" community comprises \"&lt;a href=\"Dipterocarpus%20zeylanicus\"&gt;Dipterocarpus zeylanicus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Dipterocarpus hispidus\", \"Vitex altissima\", \"Chaetocarpus castanocarpus\", \"Dillenia retusa\", \"Dillenia triquetra\", \"&lt;a href=\"Myristica%20dactyloides\"&gt;Myristica dactyloides&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Semecarpus%20gardneri\"&gt;Semecarpus gardneri&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"Mesua-Shorea\" community comprises \"&lt;a href=\"Anisophyllea%20cinnamomoides\"&gt;Anisophyllea cinnamomoides&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Cullenia%20rosayroana\"&gt;Cullenia rosayroana&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mesua%20ferrea\"&gt;Mesua ferrea&lt;/a&gt;\" (the national tree of Sri Lanka), \"&lt;a href=\"Mesua%20nagassarium\"&gt;Mesua nagassarium&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Myristica%20dactyloides\"&gt;Myristica dactyloides&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Palaquium%20petiolare\"&gt;Palaquium petiolare&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shorea%20affinis\"&gt;Shorea affinis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shorea%20congestiflora\"&gt;Shorea congestiflora&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shorea%20disticha\"&gt;Shorea disticha&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shorea%20megistophylla\"&gt;Shorea megistophylla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shorea%20trapezifolia\"&gt;Shorea trapezifolia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Shorea worthingtoni\", \"Syzygium rubicundum\", and a sub canopy of \"Chaetocarpus castanocarpus\", \"&lt;a href=\"Garcinia%20hermonii\"&gt;Garcinia hermonii&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Syzygium%20neesianum\"&gt;Syzygium neesianum&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Xylopia championi\". Virgin forests of this ecoregion have four strata, a main &lt;a href=\"Canopy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;canopy&lt;/a&gt; at , a sub-canopy at , a &lt;a href=\"understory\"&gt;understory&lt;/a&gt;, and a sparse shrub layer. Trees of the &lt;a href=\"emergent%20layer\"&gt;emergent layer&lt;/a&gt; reach above the main canopy to .\nSwamp forests situated closer to the coastlines are a distinct habit area within the ecoregion. \"&lt;a href=\"Avicennia\"&gt;Avicennia&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Rhizophora\"&gt;Rhizophora&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Sonneratia\"&gt;Sonneratia&lt;/a&gt;\" dominated &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt;s fringe the coastlines.\nBiodiversity.\nAlmost all the &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lanka are confined to the southwestern rain forests. Due to the warm and moist climate and long physical isolation, wet forest adopted species have promoted a high degree of endemism and specialization. More than 60 percent of 306 endemic tree species of Sri Lanka are restricted to this ecoregion. A further 61 species are shared with the montane rain forests and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20dry-zone%20dry%20evergreen%20forests\"&gt;dry forests&lt;/a&gt;. The dominant tree family in Asian rain forests, the family &lt;a href=\"Dipterocarpaceae\"&gt;Dipterocarpaceae&lt;/a&gt; shows a special endemicity. All but one species of the 58 species of the family &lt;a href=\"Dipterocarpaceae\"&gt;Dipterocarpaceae&lt;/a&gt; can only be found in these rain forests, including two endemic genera, &lt;a href=\"Shorea\"&gt;Shorea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stemonoporus\"&gt;Stemonoporus&lt;/a&gt;. \"Anoectochilus setaceus\" or \"Wanaraja\" (Sinhalese for \"King of forest\"), an endemic orchid, is only found in undisturbed forests of this ecoregion. Several plant species show highly localized distribution. The lowland and sub montane forests are the floristically richest in Sri Lanka and of all &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nMammals.\nSri Lanka lacks the land area to support large animals. Although fossil records of ancestral forms of &lt;a href=\"rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"hippopotamus\"&gt;hippopotamus&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s have been found. Despite the small number of species, this ecoregion is home to several near-endemic mammals, including one strict endemic species, the jungle shrew. The two endemic shrews, the Asian highland shrew and the jungle shrew are listed as vulnerable and endangered respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20leopard\"&gt;Sri Lanka leopard&lt;/a&gt;, the largest carnivore of the island, is identified as threatened. &lt;a href=\"Asian%20elephant\"&gt;Asian elephant&lt;/a&gt;s live in small numbers in these rain forests and are listed as endangered. Unlike in dry-zone forests, where they live in large numbers, this ecoregion's elephant population is faced with &lt;a href=\"Habitat%20destruction\"&gt;habitat loss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Habitat%20fragmentation\"&gt;fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Indian%20hare\"&gt;Indian hare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20cat\"&gt;fishing cat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rusty-spotted%20cat\"&gt;rusty-spotted cat&lt;/a&gt; are some of the other mammals who dwell in this ecoregion.\nThe near-endemic and strict endemic mammals live in the areas listed below. Strict endemic species are marked with an asterisk.\nBirds.\nThis ecoregion is completely contained within the &lt;a href=\"Endemism%20in%20birds\"&gt;Endemic bird area of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. Out of sixteen bird species categorized as near-endemic, two species, the green-billed coucal and the white-throated flowerpecker are indigenous. The green-billed coucal and the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20whistling-thrush\"&gt;Sri Lanka whistling-thrush&lt;/a&gt; are listed as threatened. The &lt;a href=\"ashy-headed%20laughingthrush\"&gt;ashy-headed laughingthrush&lt;/a&gt;, red-faced malkoha and &lt;a href=\"scaly%20thrush\"&gt;scaly thrush&lt;/a&gt; are the other threatened species.\nThe near-endemic and strict endemic birds live in the areas listed below. Strict endemic species are marked with an asterisk.\nReptiles, fishes and amphibians.\nSri Lanka's reptile fauna includes 204 species with 114 endemic species. A further 17 taxa are endemic at subspecies level. The &lt;a href=\"mugger%20crocodile\"&gt;mugger crocodile&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"spineless%20forest%20lizard\"&gt;spineless forest lizard&lt;/a&gt; are listed as endangered along with eight &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20fish\"&gt;freshwater fish&lt;/a&gt; species. Sri Lanka has the highest &lt;a href=\"Species%20richness\"&gt;density&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt; species worldwide (3.9 species per ). These include 250 species of &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s belonging to the family &lt;a href=\"Rhacophoridae\"&gt;Rhacophoridae&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these species have only limited range distributions, often less than . These species are also faced with habitat fragmentation and loss.\nThreats and conservation.\nMost of the Sri Lanka's rain forests were cleared for plantations, originally for &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cinchona\"&gt;cinchona&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"tea\"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining forests cover only 4.6 percent of the &lt;a href=\"Geography%20of%20Sri%20Lanka%23Ecological%20zones\"&gt;wet zone&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1990 and 2005, Sri Lanka &lt;a href=\"Deforestation%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;has showed one of the highest deforestation rates&lt;/a&gt; of primary forests in the world. \nA survey carried out in 2005 found that 17 of Sri Lanka's frogs have become extinct in the past decade and another 11 species face imminent threat of extinction unless their habitat is secured. These remaining forests exist as highly fragmented patches. Most of them are less than in extent. Poaching and the extraction of forest products (timber, firewood, medicinal plants) are a problem in almost all forest reserves.\nNevertheless, if the existing forests are preserved the condition can be improved, as many of the species of this ecoregion have small habitat needs. There are several protected areas that overlap with the ecoregion. The two most notable are the world heritage site the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Altogether, protected areas of this ecoregion accounts for only .\nProtected areas that overlap with the ecoregion:"
