    "text": "The in the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Maritime%20Self-Defense%20Force\"&gt;Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force&lt;/a&gt; is a modified version of the , with an updated &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20Combat%20System\"&gt;Aegis Combat System&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Electric%20boat\"&gt;electric propulsion system&lt;/a&gt;. \"Maya\" was commissioned on March 19, 2020. \"Haguro\" was commissioned on March 19, 2021.\nBackground.\nThe Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) began construction of the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20Combat%20System\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;-equipped from FY1988. And in FY2002 and 2003, a modified version, , was also added for its fleet.\nHowever, even after the four \"Kong\u014d\"-class and two \"Atago\"-class destroyers had been commissioned, it was still necessary to build two more Aegis-equipped destroyers to replace , the best and last survivor of &lt;a href=\"Tartar%20Guided%20Missile%20Fire%20Control%20System\"&gt;Tartar&lt;/a&gt;-equipped destroyers. The construction of these two Aegis-equipped destroyers was included in the . The first ship, JS \"Maya\", was built in the FY2015 budget.\nDesign.\nWhile it shares the same design characteristics as the \"Atago\" class, the \"Maya\" class possesses a larger hull to install a hybrid-electric propulsion system.\n\"Maya\"-class destroyers are engineered with a COGLAG (Combined Gas turbine-eLectric And Gas turbine) propulsion system, a modification of the &lt;a href=\"combined%20gas%20and%20gas\"&gt;combined gas and gas&lt;/a&gt; propulsion system employing &lt;a href=\"turbine-electric%20transmission\"&gt;turbine-electric transmission&lt;/a&gt; for low-speed cruising. The JMSDF had been testing a COGLAG propulsion system on JS \"Asuka\". Then, the adoption of the system for surface combatants began with the . While the \"Asahi\"-class system had a low voltage distribution of 450 volts, the \"Maya\"-class system is equipped with a more advanced system that can handle a high voltage distribution of 6,600 volts.\nThe JMSDF already uses an &lt;a href=\"integrated%20electric%20propulsion\"&gt;integrated electric propulsion&lt;/a&gt; system for auxiliary vessels, and is expected to expand to surface combatant ships in the future in light of its future weapon accommodation.\nEquipment.\nThe \"Maya\" class features the newer Aegis Weapon System (AWS) Baseline 9C (referred as J7 in Japan), compared with the \"Atago\" class using the Baseline 7 system (now being updated to Baseline 9C with modernization). With this system, these destroyers are equipped with the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. This will allow the ship to share surveillance or targeting information between other CEC equipped assets, whether that be from ships from the American or Australian Navy or from American or Japanese &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20Grumman%20E-2%20Hawkeye\"&gt;E-2 Hawkeye&lt;/a&gt;. In addion to the AWS, they are also equipped with an &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Defense%20System\"&gt;Aegis BMD 5.1 system&lt;/a&gt;; they are the first JMSDF Aegis vessels to be capable of ballistic &lt;a href=\"missile%20defense\"&gt;missile defense&lt;/a&gt; (BMD) from the time of its commissioning.\nIn addition to the existing &lt;a href=\"RIM-66%20Standard\"&gt;SM-2MR Block IIIB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"surface-to-air%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"RIM-174%20Standard%20ERAM\"&gt;SM-6&lt;/a&gt; will also be installed in the future. The SM-6 missiles can be networked to the CEC system and thus allow it to receive targeting information from other CEC equipped sources. While the primary role of the SM-6 is to intercept enemy aircraft and cruise missiles, the SM-6 is also capable of intercepting ballistic missiles in their terminal phase and can double as an &lt;a href=\"anti-ship%20missile\"&gt;anti-ship missile&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"anti-ballistic%20missile\"&gt;anti-ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;s, these ships are equipped with the &lt;a href=\"RIM-161%20Standard%20Missile%203\"&gt;SM-3 Block IA, IB and IIA&lt;/a&gt;. The SM-3 Block IIA is the latest variant of the SM-3 missiles, being re-designed drastically to defend broader areas.\nThe ship will use &lt;a href=\"Type%2012%20Surface-to-Ship%20Missile\"&gt;Type 17 Ship-to-Ship Missiles (SSM-2)&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an existing &lt;a href=\"Type%2090%20Ship-to-Ship%20Missile\"&gt;Type 90 (SSM-1B)&lt;/a&gt;. For lightweight &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, the HOS-303 &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s were adopted for this class, whereas the HOS-302 tubes were used until the \"Atago\" class.\nFuture armaments for the ships is slated to include locally built &lt;a href=\"railgun\"&gt;railgun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Directed-energy%20weapon\"&gt;laser point-defense system&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese ships have a &lt;a href=\"helicopter%20deck\"&gt;helicopter deck&lt;/a&gt; aft and can carry one &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; in their hangar. Although they do not carry helicopters typically, especially on JS \"Haguro\", all the necessary equipment is already installed and the helicopter can be put into operation immediately once the aircraft and its personnel are on board.\nShips in the class.\nNamesakes.\n\"Maya\" shares her name with the World War II era Japanese &lt;a href=\"Takao-class%20cruiser\"&gt;\"Takao\"-class heavy cruiser&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Japanese%20cruiser%20Maya\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt;\", while \"Haguro\" shares her name with &lt;a href=\"My%C5%8Dk%C5%8D-class%20cruiser\"&gt;\"My\u014dk\u014d\"-class heavy cruiser&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Japanese%20cruiser%20Haguro\"&gt;Haguro&lt;/a&gt;\"."
