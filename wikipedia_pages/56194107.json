    "text": "The Bride of Dionysus is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Tovey\"&gt;Donald Tovey&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"R.%20C.%20Trevelyan\"&gt;R. C. Trevelyan&lt;/a&gt;. It was written between 1907 and 1918, and premiered at the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Theatre%20%28Edinburgh%29\"&gt;Empire Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, Edinburgh, on 23 April 1929.\n\"The Bride of Dionysus\".\n\"The Bride\" is Tovey's only opera. It is based on the legends of &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ariadne\"&gt;Ariadne&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;. After its premiere, it received a few further performances in Edinburgh in 1929 and 1932. Although &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20Busch\"&gt;Fritz Busch&lt;/a&gt; enquired about the opera for performance at &lt;a href=\"Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera\"&gt;Glyndebourne Festival Opera&lt;/a&gt;, nothing came of this. Extracts from the opera were released on CD in 2010. The manuscript of the opera is at the Reid Music Library at &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20University\"&gt;Edinburgh University&lt;/a&gt;."
