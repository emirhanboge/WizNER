    "text": "Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr. (, September 28, 1910 \u2013 April 21, 1997) was the ninth &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;President of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, serving from 1961 to 1965, and the sixth &lt;a href=\"Vice-President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Vice-President&lt;/a&gt;, serving from 1957 to 1961. He also served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, and headed the &lt;a href=\"1970%20Philippine%20Constitutional%20Convention%20election\"&gt;Constitutional Convention of 1970&lt;/a&gt;. He was the father of &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, who followed his path as President of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010.\nA native of &lt;a href=\"Lubao%2C%20Pampanga\"&gt;Lubao, Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;, Macapagal graduated from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Philippines%20Manila\"&gt;University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Santo%20Tomas\"&gt;University of Santo Tomas&lt;/a&gt;, both in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, after which he worked as a lawyer for the government. He first won election in 1949 to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, representing the &lt;a href=\"Pampanga%27s%201st%20congressional%20district\"&gt;1st district&lt;/a&gt; in his home province of &lt;a href=\"Pampanga\"&gt;Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;. In 1957, he became &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;vice president&lt;/a&gt; under the rule of President &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20P.%20Garcia\"&gt;Carlos P. Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, whom he later defeated in the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1961 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs President, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy. He introduced the country's first land reform law, placed the peso on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival &lt;a href=\"Nacionalista%20Party\"&gt;Nacionalista Party&lt;/a&gt;. He is also known for shifting the country's observance of &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; from July 4 to June 12, commemorating the day President &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Aguinaldo\"&gt;Emilio Aguinaldo&lt;/a&gt; unilaterally declared the independence of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Philippine%20Republic\"&gt;First Philippine Republic&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1898. He stood for re-election in &lt;a href=\"1965%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, and was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently ruled for 20 years.\nUnder Marcos, Macapagal was elected president of the &lt;a href=\"1970%20Philippine%20Constitutional%20Convention%20election\"&gt;Constitutional Convention&lt;/a&gt; which would later draft what became the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;1973 Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, though the manner in which the charter was ratified and modified led him to later question its legitimacy. He died of heart failure, &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"renal%20failure\"&gt;renal&lt;/a&gt; complications, in 1997, at the age of 86.\nMacapagal was also a reputed poet in the Chinese and Spanish language, though his poetic oeuvre was eclipsed by his political biography.\nEarly life.\nDiosdado Macapagal was born on September 28, 1910, in &lt;a href=\"Lubao%2C%20Pampanga\"&gt;Lubao, Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;, the third of five children in a poor family. His father was Urbano Macapagal y Romero (c. 1887 \u2013 1946), a poet who wrote in the local &lt;a href=\"Pampangan%20language\"&gt;Pampangan language&lt;/a&gt; and his mother was Romana Pangan Macapagal, daughter of Atanacio Miguel Pangan (a former \"&lt;a href=\"cabeza%20de%20barangay\"&gt;cabeza de barangay&lt;/a&gt;\" of Gutad, &lt;a href=\"Floridablanca%2C%20Pampanga\"&gt;Floridablanca, Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;) and Lorenza Suing Antiveros. Urbano's mother, Escol\u00e1stica Romero Macapagal, was a midwife and schoolteacher who taught &lt;a href=\"catechism\"&gt;catechism&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiosdado is a distant descendant of &lt;a href=\"Don%20Juan%20Macapagal\"&gt;Don Juan Macapagal&lt;/a&gt;, a prince of Tondo, who was a great-grandson of the last reigning &lt;a href=\"Lakan\"&gt;Lakan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Tondo\"&gt;Kingdom of Tondo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakan%20Dula\"&gt;Lakan Dula&lt;/a&gt;. He is also related to well-to-do Licad family through his mother Romana, who was a second cousin of Mar\u00eda Vitug Licad, grandmother of renowned pianist, &lt;a href=\"Cecile%20Licad\"&gt;Cecile Licad&lt;/a&gt;. Romana's own grandmother, Genoveva Miguel Pangan and Mar\u00eda's grandmother, Celestina Miguel Macaspac, were sisters. Their mother, Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Lingad Miguel was the daughter of Jos\u00e9 Pingul Lingad and Gregoria Malit Bartolo.\nDiosdado's family earned extra income by raising pigs and accommodating boarders in their home. Due to his roots in poverty, Macapagal would later become affectionately known as the \"Poor Boy from Lubao\". Diosdado was also a reputed poet in the Spanish language although his poetic work was eclipsed by his political career.\nEarly education.\nMacapagal excelled in his studies at local public schools, graduating &lt;a href=\"valedictorian\"&gt;valedictorian&lt;/a&gt; from Lubao Elementary School, and &lt;a href=\"salutatorian\"&gt;salutatorian&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Pampanga%20High%20School\"&gt;Pampanga High School&lt;/a&gt;. He finished his pre-law course at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, then enrolled at &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Law%20School\"&gt;Philippine Law School&lt;/a&gt; in 1932, studying on a scholarship and supporting himself with a part-time job as an accountant. While in law school, he gained prominence as an orator and debater. However, he was forced to quit schooling after two years due to poor health and a lack of money.\nReturning to Pampanga, he joined boyhood friend &lt;a href=\"Rogelio%20de%20la%20Rosa\"&gt;Rogelio de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; in producing and starring in &lt;a href=\"Tagalog%20language\"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt;s patterned after classic Spanish &lt;a href=\"zarzuela\"&gt;zarzuela&lt;/a&gt;s. It was during this period that he married his friend's sister, &lt;a href=\"Purita%20Macapagal\"&gt;Purita de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; in 1938. He had two children with de la Rosa, Cielo and Arturo.\nMacapagal raised enough money to continue his studies at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Santo%20Tomas\"&gt;University of Santo Tomas&lt;/a&gt;. He also gained the assistance of philanthropist Don Honorio Ventura, the Secretary of the Interior at the time, who financed his education. He also received financial support from his mother's relatives notably from the Macaspacs who owned large tracts of land in barrio Sta. Maria, Lubao, Pampanga. After receiving his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Laws\"&gt;Bachelor of Laws&lt;/a&gt; degree in 1936, he was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Bar%20association\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;, topping the 1936 bar examination with a score of 89.95%. He later returned to his alma mater to take up graduate studies and earn a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Laws\"&gt;Master of Laws&lt;/a&gt; degree in 1941, a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Civil%20Law\"&gt;Doctor of Civil Law&lt;/a&gt; degree in 1947, and a PhD in Economics in 1957. His dissertation had \"Imperatives of Economic Development in the Philippines\" as its title.\nEarly career.\nAfter passing the bar examination, Macapagal was invited to join an American law firm as a practicing attorney, a particular honor for a Filipino at the time. He was assigned as a legal assistant to President &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20L.%20Quezon\"&gt;Manuel L. Quezon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Malaca%C3%B1ang%20Palace\"&gt;Malaca\u00f1ang Palace&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Japanese occupation of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in World War II, Macapagal continued working in Malaca\u00f1an Palace as an assistant to President &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20P.%20Laurel\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, while secretly aiding the anti-Japanese resistance during the Allied liberation country from the Japanese.\nAfter the war, Macapagal worked as an assistant attorney with one of the largest law firms in the country, \"Ross, Lawrence, Selph and Carrascoso\". With the establishment of the independent &lt;a href=\"Third%20Republic%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Third Republic of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in 1946, he rejoined government service when President &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Roxas\"&gt;Manuel Roxas&lt;/a&gt; appointed him to the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; as the head of its legal division. In 1948, President &lt;a href=\"Elpidio%20Quirino\"&gt;Elpidio Quirino&lt;/a&gt; appointed Macapagal as chief negotiator in the successful transfer of the &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Islands%2C%20Tawi-Tawi\"&gt;Turtle Islands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sulu%20Sea\"&gt;Sulu Sea&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to the Philippines. That same year, he was assigned as second secretary to the &lt;a href=\"Embassy%20of%20the%20Philippines%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Philippine Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. In 1949, he was elevated to the position of Counselor on Legal Affairs and Treaties, at the time the fourth-highest post in the Philippine Foreign Office.\nFirst marriage.\nIn 1938, he married &lt;a href=\"Purita%20Macapagal\"&gt;Purita de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt;. They had two children, Cielo Macapagal-Salgado (who would become Vice Governor of Pampanga) and &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Macapagal\"&gt;Arturo Macapagal&lt;/a&gt;. Purita died in 1943.\nSecond marriage.\nOn May 5, 1946, he married &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Macapagal\"&gt;Dr. Evangelina Macaraeg&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had two children, &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; (who would become &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;President of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;) and Diosdado Macapagal, Jr.\nHouse of Representatives.\nOn the urging of local political leaders of Pampanga province, President Quirino recalled Macapagal from his position in Washington to run for a seat in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; representing the &lt;a href=\"Pampanga%27s%201st%20congressional%20district\"&gt;1st district of Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;. The district's incumbent, Representative &lt;a href=\"Amado%20Yuzon\"&gt;Amado Yuzon&lt;/a&gt;, was a friend of Macapagal, but was opposed by the administration due to his support by communist groups. After a campaign that Macapagal described as cordial and free of personal attacks, he won a landslide victory in the &lt;a href=\"1949%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1949 election&lt;/a&gt;. He won re-election in the &lt;a href=\"1953%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1953 election&lt;/a&gt;, and served as Representative in the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;2nd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;3rd Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of legislative sessions in 1950, the members of the House of Representatives elected Macapagal as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he was given several important foreign assignments. He was a Philippine delegate to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;United Nations General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; multiple times, notably distinguishing himself in debates over Communist aggression with &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Vishinsky\"&gt;Andrei Vishinsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Malik\"&gt;Jacob Malik&lt;/a&gt; of the Soviet Union. He took part in negotiations for the &lt;a href=\"Mutual%20Defense%20Treaty%20%28US-Philippines%29\"&gt;U.S.-R.P. Mutual Defense Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Laurel%E2%80%93Langley%20Agreement\"&gt;Laurel\u2013Langley Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20San%20Francisco\"&gt;Japanese Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. He also authored the Foreign Service Act, which reorganized and strengthened the Philippine &lt;a href=\"foreign%20service\"&gt;foreign service&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Representative, Macapagal authored and sponsored several laws of socio-economic importance, particularly aimed at benefiting the rural areas and the poor. Among the pieces of legislation which Macapagal promoted were the Minimum Wage Law, Rural Health Law, Rural Bank Law, the Law on Barrio Councils, the Barrio Industrialization Law, and a law nationalizing the rice and corn industries. He was consistently selected by the Congressional Press Club as one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen during his tenure. In his second term, he was named Most Outstanding lawmaker of the 3rd Congress .\nVice presidency.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1957%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 1957 general elections&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; drafted Congressman Macapagal to run for vice president as the running-mate of &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Yulo\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Y. Yulo&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20Philippine%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Speaker of the House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. Macapagal's nomination was particularly boosted by Liberal Party President &lt;a href=\"Eugenio%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Eugenio P\u00e9rez&lt;/a&gt;, who insisted that the party's vice presidential nominee have a clean record of integrity and honesty. While Yulo was defeated by Carlos P. Garcia of the &lt;a href=\"Nacionalista%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Nacionalista Party&lt;/a&gt;, Macapagal was elected vice president in an upset victory, defeating the Nacionalista candidate, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Laurel%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 B. Laurel, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, by over eight percentage points. A month after the election, he was chosen as the president of the Liberal Party.\nAs the first ever Philippine vice president to be elected from a rival party of the president, Macapagal served out his four-year vice presidential term as a leader of the &lt;a href=\"opposition%20%28government%29\"&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt;. The ruling party refused to give him a &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;Cabinet position&lt;/a&gt; in the Garcia administration, which was a break from tradition. He was offered a position in the Cabinet only on the condition that he switch allegiance to the ruling Nationalista Party, but he declined the offer and instead played the role of critic to the administration's policies and performance. This allowed him to capitalize on the increasing unpopularity of the Garcia administration. Assigned to performing only ceremonial duties as vice president, he spent his time making frequent trips to the countryside to acquaint himself with voters and to promote the image of the Liberal Party.\nAs President,\u00a0Macapagal\u00a0worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy.\nPresidency.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1961 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Macapagal ran against Garcia's re-election bid, promising an end to corruption and appealing to the electorate as a common man from humble beginnings. He defeated the incumbent president with a 55% to 45% margin. His inauguration as the president of the Philippines took place on December 30, 1961.\nDomestic policies.\nEconomy.\nIn his inaugural address, Macapagal promised a socio-economic program anchored on \"a return to free and private enterprise\", placing economic development in the hands of private entrepreneurs with minimal government interference.\nTwenty days after the inauguration, exchange controls were lifted and the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;Philippine peso&lt;/a&gt; was allowed to float on the free currency exchange market. The currency controls were initially adopted by the administration of &lt;a href=\"Elpidio%20Quirino\"&gt;Elpidio Quirino&lt;/a&gt; as a temporary measure, but continued to be adopted by succeeding administrations. The peso devalued from P2.64 to the U.S. dollar, and stabilized at P3.80 to the dollar, supported by a $300\u00a0million stabilization fund from the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo achieve the national goal of &lt;a href=\"economic\"&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt; and social progress with prosperity reaching down to the masses, there existed a choice of methods. First, there was the choice between the &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dictator\"&gt;dictator&lt;/a&gt;ial systems, the latter prevailing in &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; countries. On this, the choice was easy as Filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method. With the democratic mechanism, however, the next choice was between &lt;a href=\"free%20enterprise\"&gt;free enterprise&lt;/a&gt; and the continuing of the controls system. Macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before Congress on January 22, 1962, that \"the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government.\nBefore independence there was free enterprise in the Philippines under Presidents &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Quezon\"&gt;Manuel Quezon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Osme%C3%B1a\"&gt;Sergio Osme\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Roxas\"&gt;Manuel Roxas&lt;/a&gt;. In 1950 President &lt;a href=\"Elpidio%20Quirino\"&gt;Elpidio Quirino&lt;/a&gt; deviated from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls. The controls system was carried on by President Magsaysay and Garcia.\nThe first fundamental decision Macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of Quirino, Magsaysay and Garcia or to return to the free enterprise of Quezon, Osmena and Roxas. It had been his view since he was a Congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for Filipinos was free enterprise. So on January 21, 1962, after working for 20 straight hours he signed a Central Bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.\nDuring the 20 days available to make a decision on choice between controls and free enterprise, between his inauguration as president and before the opening of &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Macapagal's main adviser was Governor Andres Castillo of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bank%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther reform efforts by Macapagal were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, Macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress, and annual GDP growth averaged at 5.53% for 1962\u201365.\nSocio-economic program.\nThe removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which Macapagal could work out economic and social progress. A specific and periodic program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to attain the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his labors.\nSuch a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and reputable economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was Sixto Roxas III. From an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the Five-Year program \u2013 formally known as the Five-Year Socio-Economic Integrated Development Program \u2013 it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives.\nFree enterprise was restored with decontrol. The Five-Year Economic Program had been prescribed. Land reform abolishing tenancy had been launched. These were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest number.\nThe essential foundations having been laid, attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main &lt;a href=\"edifice\"&gt;edifice&lt;/a&gt; by implementing the economic program. Although the success of Macapagal's Socio-Economic Program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector, it would be helpful and necessary for the government to render active assistance in its implementation by the citizens.\nSuch role of the government in &lt;a href=\"free%20enterprise\"&gt;free enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, in the view of Macapagal, required it (1) to provide the social overhead like roads, airfields and ports that directly or proximately promote economic growth, (2) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies salutary to investments, and most importantly (3) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries, particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves. Among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were &lt;a href=\"steel%20mill%23Integrated%20mill\"&gt;integrated steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fertilizer\"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pulp%20%28paper%29\"&gt;pulp&lt;/a&gt;, meat &lt;a href=\"canning\"&gt;canning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;.\nLand reform.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Magsaysay\"&gt;Ramon Magsaysay&lt;/a&gt;, President Diosdado Macapagal came from the masses. He savored calling himself the \"Poor boy from Lubao\". Ironically, he had little popularity among the masses. This could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his stiff personality. But despite this, Macapagal had certain achievements. Foremost of these was the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Republic Act No. 3844) which provided for the purchase of private farmlands with the intention of distributing them in small lots to the landless tenants on easy term of payment. It is a major development in history of &lt;a href=\"land%20reform%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;land reform in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;,\nIn comparison with the previous agrarian legislation, the law lowered the retention limit to 75 hectares, whether owned by individuals or corporations. It removed the term \"contiguous\" and established the &lt;a href=\"leasehold\"&gt;leasehold&lt;/a&gt; system. The share-&lt;a href=\"tenancy\"&gt;tenancy&lt;/a&gt; or the \"kasama\" system was prohibited. It formulated a &lt;a href=\"bill%20of%20rights\"&gt;bill of rights&lt;/a&gt; that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a &lt;a href=\"minimum%20wage\"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt;. It also created an office that acquired and distributed farmlands and a financing institution for this purpose. The major flaw of this law was, however, that it had several exemptions, such as ort (big capital &lt;a href=\"plantations\"&gt;plantations&lt;/a&gt; established during the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%281521%E2%80%931898%29\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%281898%E2%80%931946%29\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; periods); fishponds, saltbeds, and lands primarily planted to &lt;a href=\"citrus\"&gt;citrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coconuts\"&gt;coconuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theobroma%20cacao\"&gt;cacao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coffee%20bean\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"durian\"&gt;durian&lt;/a&gt;, and other similar permanent trees; landholdings converted to &lt;a href=\"Residential%20property\"&gt;residential&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20property\"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"industrial%20property\"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt;, or other similar non-agricultural purposes.\nIt was viewed that the 75-hectare retention limit was just too high for the growing population density. Moreover, this law merely allowed the transfer of the &lt;a href=\"landlord\"&gt;landlord&lt;/a&gt;ism from one area to another. This was because landlords were paid in bonds, which he could use to purchase agricultural lands. Likewise, the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the &lt;a href=\"leasehold\"&gt;leasehold&lt;/a&gt; arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.\nWithin two years after the law was implemented, no land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s' inability to purchase the land. Besides, the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; seemed lacking of strong political will, as shown by the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;' allotment of only one million &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20peso\"&gt;Philippine peso&lt;/a&gt;s for the implementation of this code. At least Php200\u00a0million was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code, and Php300\u00a0million in the next three years for the program to be successful. However, by 1972, the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering 68 estates, at the cost of Php57\u00a0million to the government. Consequently, by the 1970s, the farmers ended up tilling less land, with their share in the farm also being less. They incurred more debts, depending on the &lt;a href=\"landlord\"&gt;landlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creditor\"&gt;creditor&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;palay&lt;/a&gt; buyers. Indeed, during the administration of Macapagal, the productivity of the &lt;a href=\"farmers\"&gt;farmers&lt;/a&gt; further declined.\nAnti-corruption drive.\nOne of Macapagal's major campaign pledges had been to clean out the government corruption that had proliferated under former President Garcia. The administration also openly feuded with Filipino businessmen &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eugenio%20Lopez%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Eugenio Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses. The administration alluded to the brothers as \"Filipino Stonehills who build and maintain business empires through political power, including the corruption of politicians and other officials\". In the &lt;a href=\"1965%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1965 election&lt;/a&gt;, the Lopezes threw their support behind Macapagal's rival, &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, with Fernando Lopez serving Marcos' running mate.\nStonehill controversy.\nThe Administration's campaign against corruption was tested by &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Stonehill\"&gt;Harry Stonehill&lt;/a&gt;, an American expatriate with a $50-million business empire in the Philippines. Macapagal's Secretary of Justice, &lt;a href=\"Jose%20W.%20Diokno\"&gt;Jose W. Diokno&lt;/a&gt; investigated Stonehill on charges of tax evasion, smuggling, misdeclaration of imports, and corruption of public officials. Diokno's investigation revealed Stonehill's ties to corruption within the government. Macapagal, however, prevented Diokno from prosecuting Stonehill by deporting the American instead, then dismissing Diokno from the cabinet. Diokno questioned Macapagal's actions, saying, \"How can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go?\" Diokno later served as a &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Senator of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndependence Day.\nMacapagal appealed to nationalist sentiments by shifting the commemoration of Philippine independence day. On May 12, 1962, he signed a proclamation which declared Tuesday, June 12, 1962, as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from Spain on that date in 1898. The change became permanent in 1964 with the signing of Republic Act No. 4166. For having issued his 1962 proclamation, Macapagal is generally credited with having moved the celebration date of the Independence Day holiday. Years later, Macapagal told journalist &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Karnow\"&gt;Stanley Karnow&lt;/a&gt; the real reason for the change: \"When I was in the diplomatic corps, I noticed that nobody came to our receptions on the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20of%20July\"&gt;Fourth of July&lt;/a&gt;, but went to the American Embassy instead. So, to compete, I decided we needed a different holiday.\"\nForeign policies.\nNorth Borneo claim.\nOn September 12, 1962, during President Diosdado Macapagal's administration, the territory of eastern &lt;a href=\"North%20Borneo\"&gt;North Borneo&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Sabah\"&gt;Sabah&lt;/a&gt;), and the full sovereignty, title and dominion over the territory were ceded by heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Sulu\"&gt;Sultanate of Sulu&lt;/a&gt;, HM Sultan Muhammad Esmail E. Kiram I, to the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Republic of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. The cession effectively gave the Philippine government the full authority to pursue their claim in international courts. The Philippines broke diplomatic relations with Malaysia after the federation had included Sabah in 1963. It was revoked in 1989 because succeeding Philippine administrations have placed the claim in the back burner in the interest of pursuing cordial economic and security relations with &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;. To date, Malaysia continues to consistently reject Philippine calls to resolve the matter of Sabah's jurisdiction to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Sabah sees the claim made by the Philippines' Moro leader Nur Misuari to take Sabah to International Court of Justice (ICJ) as a non-issue and thus dismissed the claim.\nMAPHILINDO.\nIn July 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal convened a summit meeting in Manila in which a nonpolitical confederation for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, &lt;a href=\"Maphilindo\"&gt;Maphilindo&lt;/a&gt;, was proposed as a realization of &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Rizal\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Rizal&lt;/a&gt;'s dream of bringing together the Malay peoples, seen as artificially divided by colonial frontiers.\nMaphilindo was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern in the spirit of consensus. However, it was also perceived as a tactic on the parts of &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; to delay, or even prevent, the formation of the Federation of &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. Manila had its own claim to &lt;a href=\"Sabah\"&gt;Sabah&lt;/a&gt; (formerly &lt;a href=\"British%20North%20Borneo\"&gt;British North Borneo&lt;/a&gt;), and Jakarta protested the formation of Malaysia as a &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British imperialist&lt;/a&gt; plot. The plan failed when &lt;a href=\"Sukarno\"&gt;Sukarno&lt;/a&gt; adopted his plan of \"&lt;a href=\"konfrontasi\"&gt;konfrontasi&lt;/a&gt;\" with Malaysia. The Konfrontasi, or Confrontation basically aimed at preventing Malaysia from attaining independence. The idea was inspired onto President Sukarno by the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), or literally the &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Indonesian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. The party convinced President Sukarno that the formation of Malaysia is a form of &lt;a href=\"neocolonialism\"&gt;neo-colonization&lt;/a&gt; and would affect tranquility in Indonesia. The subsequent development of &lt;a href=\"ASEAN\"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/a&gt; almost certainly excludes any possibility of the project ever being revived.\nVietnam War.\nBefore the end of his term in 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal persuaded &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to send troops to &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. However this proposal was blocked by the opposition led by &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Senate President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; who deserted Macapagal's &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and defected to the &lt;a href=\"Nacionalista%20Party\"&gt;Nacionalista Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Government\"&gt;U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;'s active interest in bringing other nations into the war had been part of U.S. policy discussions as early as 1961. President &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon Johnson&lt;/a&gt; first publicly appealed for other countries to come to the aid of South Vietnam on April 23, 1964\u2013in what was called the \"More Flags\" program. Chester Cooper, former director of Asian affairs for the White House, explained why the impetus came from the United States instead of from the Republic of South Vietnam: \"The 'More Flags' campaign\u00a0... required the application of considerable pressure for Washington to elicit any meaningful commitments. One of the more exasperating aspects of the search\u2026was the lassitude\u00a0\u2026... of the Saigon government. In part\u00a0... the South Vietnam leaders were preoccupied with political jockeying.\u00a0... In addition, Saigon appeared to believe that the program was a public relations campaign directed at the American people.\"\n1963 midterm election.\nThe senatorial election was held on November 12, 1963. Macapagal's &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (LP) won four out of the eight seats up for grabs during the election \u2013 thereby increasing the LP's senate seats from eight to ten.\n1965 presidential campaign.\nTowards the end of his term, Macapagal decided to seek re-election to continue seeking reforms which he claimed were stifled by a \"dominant and uncooperative opposition\" in Congress. With Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, a fellow member of the Liberal Party, unable to win his party's nomination due to Macapagal's re-election bid, Marcos switched allegiance to the rival Nacionalista Party to oppose Macapagal.\nAmong the issues raised against the incumbent administration were graft and corruption, rise in consumer goods, and persisting peace and order issues. Macapagal was defeated by Marcos in the &lt;a href=\"1965%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;November 1965 polls&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-presidency and death.\nMacapagal announced his retirement from politics following his 1965 loss to Marcos. In 1971, he was elected president of the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29\"&gt;constitutional convention&lt;/a&gt; that drafted what became the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Philippines%23The%201973%20Constitution\"&gt;1973 Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The manner in which the charter was ratified and later modified led him to later question its legitimacy. In 1979, he formed the National Union for Liberation as a political party to oppose the Marcos regime.\nFollowing the restoration of democracy in 1986, Macapagal took on the role of elder &lt;a href=\"Politician\"&gt;statesman&lt;/a&gt;, and was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Council%20of%20State\"&gt;Philippine Council of State&lt;/a&gt;. He also served as honorary chairman of the National Centennial Commission, and chairman of the board of CAP Life, among others.\nIn his retirement, Macapagal devoted much of his time to reading and writing. He published his presidential memoir, authored several books about government and economics, and wrote a weekly column for the \"&lt;a href=\"Manila%20Bulletin\"&gt;Manila Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper.\nDiosdado Macapagal died of heart failure, &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"renal%20failure\"&gt;renal&lt;/a&gt; complications at the &lt;a href=\"Makati%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Makati Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; on April 21, 1997. He is buried at the &lt;a href=\"Libingan%20ng%20mga%20Bayani\"&gt;Libingan ng mga Bayani&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nOn September 28, 2009, Macapagal's daughter, President &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated the President Diosdado Macapagal Museum and Library, located at his home town of &lt;a href=\"Lubao%2C%20Pampanga\"&gt;Lubao, Pampanga&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresident &lt;a href=\"Benigno%20S.%20Aquino%20III\"&gt;Benigno S. Aquino III&lt;/a&gt; declared September 28, 2010 as a special non-working holiday in Macapagal's home province of Pampanga to commemorate the centennial of his birth.\nMuseum and library.\nThese house the personal books and memorabilia of Macapagal.\nElectoral history.\n&lt;a href=\"1957%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;Vice Presidential election, 1957&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"1961%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;Presidential election, 1961&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"1965%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;Presidential election, 1965&lt;/a&gt;:\nSee also.\nNamed after Diosdado Macapagal:"
