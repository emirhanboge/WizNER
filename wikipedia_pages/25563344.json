The type is sold as a kit for &lt;a href=\"Homebuilt%20aircraft\"&gt;home construction&lt;/a&gt; or as a complete ready-to-fly aircraft.\nDevelopment.\nDesigned as a smaller version of the &lt;a href=\"Murphy%20Rebel\"&gt;Rebel&lt;/a&gt;, the Maverick is an all-metal high-wing braced monoplane with two side-by-side seats and a &lt;a href=\"conventional%20landing%20gear\"&gt;tailwheel landing gear&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft was designed around the &lt;a href=\"Rotax%20503\"&gt;Rotax 503&lt;/a&gt; powerplant, with the goal of producing an economical ultralight trainer. As a homebuilt it can also be fitted with a number of different piston engines including the &lt;a href=\"HKS%20700\"&gt;HKS 700&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotax%20582\"&gt;Rotax 582&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jabiru%202200\"&gt;Jabiru 2200&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft is mainly built from sheet aluminium, with the tail and rear sections of the wings &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20fabric%20covering\"&gt;fabric covered&lt;/a&gt; to save weight. The wings are constructed using a \"D\" cell, with stamped ribs and a single wing &lt;a href=\"strut\"&gt;strut&lt;/a&gt;.
