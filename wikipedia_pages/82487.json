    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, Hippocrene () was a &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28hydrology%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Helicon\"&gt;Mt. Helicon&lt;/a&gt;. It was sacred to the &lt;a href=\"Muses\"&gt;Muses&lt;/a&gt; and formed by the hooves of &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. Its name literally translates as \"Horse's Fountain\" and the water was supposed to bring forth poetic inspiration when imbibed.\nSources.\n&lt;a href=\"Hesiod\"&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt; refers to the horse's well on Helicon in his \"&lt;a href=\"Theogony\"&gt;Theogony&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAnd after they have washed their tender skin in Permessus or Hippocrene or holy Olmeidus, they perform choral dances on highest Helicon, beautiful, lovely ones, and move nimbly with their feet.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Keats\"&gt;John Keats&lt;/a&gt; refers to Hippocrene in his poem \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20to%20a%20Nightingale\"&gt;Ode to a Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;\".\nO for a beaker full of the warm South\nFull of the true, the blushful \"Hippocrene\",\nWith beaded bubbles winking at the brim,\nAnd purple-stained mouth;\nThat I might drink, and leave the world unseen,\nAnd with thee fade away into the forest dim:\n&lt;a href=\"Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow\"&gt;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&lt;/a&gt; mentions the fountain in his poem \"Goblet of Life\":\nNo purple flowers,\u2014no garlands green,\nConceal the goblet's shade or sheen,\nNor maddening draughts of Hippocrene,\nLike gleams of sunshine, flash between\nThick leaves of mistletoe.\n&lt;a href=\"Petrarch\"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt; refers to the fountain of Helicon in his epic poem \"&lt;a href=\"Africa%20%28Petrarch%29\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;\"\nSisters who are\nmy sweet care, if I sing to you of wonders, I pray that it be granted to me to drink again at\nthe fountain of Helicon. \nIn popular culture.\nThe creation of the Hippocrene by Pegasus was a &lt;a href=\"Jeopardy%21\"&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/a&gt; question in September 2021."
