    "text": "Canberra ( )\nis the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Founded following the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Australia\"&gt;federation of the colonies&lt;/a&gt; of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia's largest inland city and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Australia%20by%20population\"&gt;eighth-largest city overall&lt;/a&gt;. Unusual among Australian cities, it is an entirely &lt;a href=\"Planned%20community\"&gt;planned city&lt;/a&gt;. The city is located at the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; at the northern tip of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Alps\"&gt;Australian Alps&lt;/a&gt;, the country's highest mountain range. As of June 2020, Canberra's estimated population was 431,380.\nThe area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for up to 21,000 years, with the principal group being the &lt;a href=\"Ngunnawal%20people\"&gt;Ngunnawal people&lt;/a&gt;. European settlement commenced in the first half of the 19th century, as evidenced by surviving landmarks such as &lt;a href=\"St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid\"&gt;St John's Anglican Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blundells%20Cottage\"&gt;Blundells Cottage&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Following a long dispute over whether &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, so long as it was at least from Sydney. The capital city was founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913. A blueprint by American architects &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Walter Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Mahony%20Griffin\"&gt;Marion Mahony Griffin&lt;/a&gt; was selected after an international design contest, and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks such as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29\"&gt;Black Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ainslie\"&gt;Mount Ainslie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Capital Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%20Hill%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;City Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Canberra's mountainous location makes it the only mainland Australian city where snow-capped mountains can be seen in winter; although snow in the city itself is rare.\nAs the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Government of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Government%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Government House&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; and the headquarters of numerous government agencies. It is the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance such as the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20University\"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Mint\"&gt;Royal Australian Mint&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport\"&gt;Australian Institute of Sport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Library%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Library&lt;/a&gt;. The city is home to many important institutions of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon\"&gt;Royal Military College Duntroon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy\"&gt;Australian Defence Force Academy&lt;/a&gt;. It hosts all foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations.\nCanberra has been ranked among the world's best cities to live and visit. Although the Commonwealth Government remains the largest single employer in Canberra, it is no longer the majority employer. Other major industries have developed in the city, including in health care, professional services, education and training, retail, accommodation and food, and construction. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. At the 2016 Census, 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were reported as having been born overseas.\nCanberra's design is influenced by the &lt;a href=\"garden%20city%20movement\"&gt;garden city movement&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. Its design can be viewed from its highest point at the &lt;a href=\"Telstra%20Tower\"&gt;Telstra Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the summit of Mount Ainslie. Other notable features include the &lt;a href=\"National%20Arboretum%20Canberra\"&gt;National Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;, born out of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Canberra%20bushfires\"&gt;2003 Canberra bushfires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Lake Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, named for the city's architects. Highlights in the annual calendar of cultural events include &lt;a href=\"Floriade%20%28Canberra%29\"&gt;Floriade&lt;/a&gt;, the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere, the &lt;a href=\"Enlighten%20Canberra\"&gt;Enlighten Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20%28Canberra%29\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Multicultural%20Festival\"&gt;National Multicultural Festival&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summernats\"&gt;Summernats&lt;/a&gt;. Canberra's main sporting venues are &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Stadium\"&gt;Canberra Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manuka%20Oval\"&gt;Manuka Oval&lt;/a&gt;. The city is served with domestic and international flights at &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Airport\"&gt;Canberra Airport&lt;/a&gt;, while interstate train and coach services depart from &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20railway%20station\"&gt;Canberra Railway Station&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jolimont%20Centre\"&gt;Jolimont Centre&lt;/a&gt; respectively. &lt;a href=\"City%20Interchange\"&gt;City Interchange&lt;/a&gt; is the main hub of Canberra's bus and light rail transport network.\nName.\nThe word \"Canberra\" is popularly claimed to derive from the word or , which is claimed to mean \"meeting place\" in &lt;a href=\"Ngunnawal%20language\"&gt;Ngunnawal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Indigenous languages spoken in the district by &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal Australians&lt;/a&gt; before European settlers arrived, although there is no clear evidence to support this. An alternative definition has been claimed by numerous local commentators over the years, including the Ngunnawal elder Don Bell, whereby or means \"woman's breasts\" and is the indigenous name for the two mountains, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29\"&gt;Black Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ainslie\"&gt;Mount Ainslie&lt;/a&gt;, which lie almost opposite each other. In the 1860s, the name was reported by &lt;a href=\"Queanbeyan\"&gt;Queanbeyan&lt;/a&gt; newspaper owner &lt;a href=\"John%20Gale%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;John Gale&lt;/a&gt; to be an interpretation of the name or , meaning \"hollow between a woman's breasts\", and referring to the &lt;a href=\"Sullivans%20Creek\"&gt;Sullivans Creek&lt;/a&gt; floodplain between Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain. An 1830s map of the region by Major Mitchell indeed does mark the Sullivan's Creek floodplain between these two mountains as \"Nganbra\". \"Nganbra\" or \"Nganbira\" could readily have been anglicised to the name \"Canberry\", as the locality soon become known to European settlers.\nR. H. Cambage in his 1919 book \"Notes on the Native Flora of New South Wales, Part X, the Federal Capital Territory\" noted that Joshua John Moore, the first settler in the region, named the area Canberry in 1823 stating that \"there seems no doubt that the original was a native name, but its meaning is unknown.\"' Survey plans of the district dated 1837 refer to the area as the \"Canberry Plain\". In 1920, some of the older residents of the district claimed that the name was derived from the &lt;a href=\"Lissanthe%20sapida\"&gt;Australian Cranberry&lt;/a&gt; which grew abundantly in the area, noting that the local name for the plant was \"canberry\". Although sometimes pronounced or , the original pronunciation at its official naming in 1913 was .\nAlternative proposals for the name of the city before its creation included Austral, Australville, Aurora, Captain Cook, Caucus City, Cookaburra, Dampier, Eden, Eucalypta, Flinders, Gonebroke Home, Hopetoun, Kangaremu, Myola, Meladneyperbane, New Era, Olympus, Paradise, Shakespeare, Sydmelperadbrisho, Swindleville, The National City, Union City, Unison, Wattleton, Wheatwoolgold, Yass-Canberra.\nHistory.\nFirst inhabitants.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Australia%20%281788%E2%80%931850%29\"&gt;European settlement&lt;/a&gt;, the area in which Canberra would eventually be constructed was seasonally inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt;. Anthropologist &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Tindale\"&gt;Norman Tindale&lt;/a&gt; suggested the principal group occupying the region were the &lt;a href=\"Ngunnawal%20people\"&gt;Ngunnawal people&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Ngarigo\"&gt;Ngarigo&lt;/a&gt; lived immediately to the south of the ACT, the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, &lt;a href=\"Gandangara%20people\"&gt;Gandangara people&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Wiradjuri\"&gt;Wiradjuri&lt;/a&gt; to the north-west. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites as well as stone tools and arrangements. Artefacts suggests early human activity occurred at some point in the area 21,000 years previously.\nEuropean exploration.\n European exploration and settlement started in the Canberra area as early as the 1820s. There were four expeditions between 1820 and 1824. European settlement of the area probably dates from 1823, when a homestead was built on what is now the Acton Peninsula by stockmen employed by Joshua John Moore. He formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826 and named the property \"Canberry\". On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of at Canberry.\nThe Anglican church of &lt;a href=\"St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid\"&gt;St John the Baptist&lt;/a&gt;, in the suburb of Reid, was consecrated in 1845 and is now the oldest surviving public building in the city. St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district. It has been described as a \"sanctuary in the city\", remaining a small English village-style church even as the capital grew around it. Canberra's first school, St John's School (now a museum), was situated next to the church and opened in the same year of 1845. It was built to educate local settlers children, including the Blundell children who lived in nearby &lt;a href=\"Blundell%27s%20Cottage\"&gt;Blundell's Cottage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe European population in the Canberra area continued to grow slowly throughout the 19th century. Among them was the Campbell family of \"Duntroon\"; their imposing stone house is now the officers' mess of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon\"&gt;Royal Military College, Duntroon&lt;/a&gt;. The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of \"&lt;a href=\"Weetangera%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Weetangera&lt;/a&gt;\". Other notable early settlers included the inter-related Murray and Gibbes families, who owned the &lt;a href=\"Yarralumla%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Yarralumla&lt;/a&gt; estate \u2014now the site of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;official residence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Governor-General\"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; of Australia \u2014 from the 1830s through to 1881. Associated with the Yarralumla Estate and Government House is the adjoining &lt;a href=\"Yarralumla%20Woolshed%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Yarralumla Woolshed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the European presence increased, the indigenous population dwindled largely due to introduced diseases such as smallpox and measles.\nCreation of the nation's capital.\nThe district's change from a rural area in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; to the national capital started during debates over &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Australia\"&gt;federation&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least from Sydney, with Melbourne to be the temporary seat of government while the new capital was built. A survey was conducted across several sites in New South Wales with &lt;a href=\"Bombala%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Bombala&lt;/a&gt;, southern &lt;a href=\"Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Monaro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Yass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albury\"&gt;Albury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamworth%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Tamworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Armidale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tumut%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Tumut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalgety%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Dalgety&lt;/a&gt; all discussed. Dalgety was chosen by the federal parliament and it passed the \"&lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Government%20Act%201904\"&gt;Seat of Government Act 1904&lt;/a&gt;\" confirming Dalgety as the site of the nation's capital. However, the New South Wales government refused to cede the required territory as they did not accept the site. In 1906, the New South Wales Government finally agreed to cede sufficient land provided that it was in the Yass-Canberra region as this site was closer to Sydney. Newspaper proprietor &lt;a href=\"John%20Gale%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;John Gale&lt;/a&gt; circulated a pamphlet titled 'Dalgety or Canberra: Which?' advocating Canberra to every member of the Commonwealth's seven state and federal parliaments. By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908 as was a result of survey work done by the government &lt;a href=\"surveying\"&gt;surveyor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Scrivener\"&gt;Charles Scrivener&lt;/a&gt;. The NSW government ceded the district to the federal government in 1911 and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Federal Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; was established.\nAn international design competition was launched by the Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects\"&gt;Royal Institute of British Architects&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers\"&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt; and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire because the Minister for Home Affairs &lt;a href=\"King%20O%27Malley\"&gt;King O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning. A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity. On 24 May 1911, O'Malley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Walter Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Mahony%20Griffin\"&gt;Marion Mahony Griffin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, being declared the winner. Second was &lt;a href=\"Eliel%20Saarinen\"&gt;Eliel Saarinen&lt;/a&gt; of Finland and third was &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Agache%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Alfred Agache&lt;/a&gt; of Brazil but resident in Paris, France. O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. On 25 November 1912, the board advised that it could not support Griffin's plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising. This plan incorporated the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913. In 1913, Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began. On 23 February, King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.\nIn 1912, the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city. Almost 750 names were suggested. At midday on 12\u00a0March 1913, &lt;a href=\"Gertrude%20Denman%2C%20Baroness%20Denman\"&gt;Lady Denman&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of Governor-General &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Denman%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Denman\"&gt;Lord Denman&lt;/a&gt;, announced that the city would be named \"Canberra\" at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill, which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Day\"&gt;Canberra Day&lt;/a&gt; is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra. After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin's work; a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials and his original plan was reinstated. Griffin's relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in\u00a01920, little work had been done. By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.\nDevelopment throughout 20th century.\nThe Commonwealth government purchased the pastoral property of &lt;a href=\"Government%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Yarralumla&lt;/a&gt; in 1913 to provide an official residence for the Governor-General of Australia in the new capital. Renovations began in 1925 to enlarge and modernise the property. In 1927, the property was official dubbed Government House. On 9 May that year, the Commonwealth parliament moved to Canberra with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Provisional Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Bruce\"&gt;Stanley Bruce&lt;/a&gt; had officially taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"The%20Lodge%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;The Lodge&lt;/a&gt; a few days earlier. Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression%20in%20Australia\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s and during World War\u00a0II. Some projects planned for that time, including &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; cathedrals, were never completed. (Nevertheless, in 1973 the Roman Catholic parish church of St. Christopher was remodelled into &lt;a href=\"St.%20Christopher%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Manuka\"&gt;St. Christopher's Cathedral, Manuka&lt;/a&gt;, serving the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is the only cathedral in Canberra.)\nFrom 1920 to 1957, three bodies \u2014 successively the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Capital%20Advisory%20Committee\"&gt;Federal Capital Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Capital%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Capital Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Planning%20and%20Development%20Committee\"&gt;National Capital Planning and Development Committee&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin. However, they were only advisory and development decisions were made without consulting them, which increased inefficiency.\nThe largest event in Canberra up to World War II was the 24th Meeting of &lt;a href=\"ANZAAS\"&gt;ANZAAS&lt;/a&gt; in January 1939. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Canberra%20Times\"&gt;The Canberra Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as \"a signal event ... in the history of this, the world's youngest capital city\". The city's accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the 1,250 delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the Molonglo River. One of the prominent speakers was &lt;a href=\"H.%20G.%20Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt;, who was a guest of the Governor-General &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Hore-Ruthven%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gowrie\"&gt;Lord Gowrie&lt;/a&gt; for a week. This event coincided with a heatwave across south-eastern Australia during which the temperature in Canberra reached 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 Celsius) on 11 January. On Friday, 13 January, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Friday%20bushfires\"&gt;Black Friday bushfires&lt;/a&gt; caused 71 deaths in Victoria and Wells accompanied the Governor-General on his tour of areas threatened by fires.\nImmediately after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as \"several suburbs in search of a city\". Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Robert%20Menzies\"&gt;Sir Robert Menzies&lt;/a&gt; regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance. Menzies remained in office for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly. The population grew by more than 50\u00a0per\u00a0cent in every five-year period from 1955 to\u00a01975. Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from Melbourne following the war. &lt;a href=\"Public%20housing%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Government housing&lt;/a&gt; projects were undertaken to accommodate the city's growing population.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission\"&gt;National Capital Development Commission&lt;/a&gt; (NCDC) formed in 1957 with executive powers and ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Lake Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the centrepiece of Griffin's design \u2014 and construction was completed in\u00a01964 after four years of work. The completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20Triangle%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Parliamentary Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.\nThe newly built &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20University\"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; was expanded and sculptures as well as monuments were built. A new &lt;a href=\"National%20Library%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Library&lt;/a&gt; was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;. Suburbs in &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Central\"&gt;Canberra Central&lt;/a&gt; (often referred to as &lt;a href=\"North%20Canberra\"&gt;North Canberra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Canberra\"&gt;South Canberra&lt;/a&gt;) were further developed in the\u00a01950s and urban development in the &lt;a href=\"Suburbs%20of%20Canberra%23Districts\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Woden%20Valley\"&gt;Woden Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belconnen\"&gt;Belconnen&lt;/a&gt; commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively. Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians such as &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Barton\"&gt;Barton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Deakin\"&gt;Deakin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;Reid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Braddon\"&gt;Braddon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Curtin\"&gt;Curtin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Chifley\"&gt;Chifley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Parkes\"&gt;Parkes&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 9 May 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations. The Commonwealth Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.\nSelf-government.\nIn December 1988, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament, a step proposed as early as 1965. Following the first election on 4 March 1989, a 17-member &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; sat at temporary offices at 1\u00a0Constitution Avenue, Civic, on 11 May 1989. Permanent premises were opened on London Circuit in 1994. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister &lt;a href=\"Rosemary%20Follett\"&gt;Rosemary Follett&lt;/a&gt;, who made history as Australia's first female head of government.\nParts of Canberra were engulfed by &lt;a href=\"2003%20Canberra%20bushfires\"&gt;bushfires on 18 January 2003&lt;/a&gt; that killed four people, injured 435 and destroyed more than 500 homes as well as the major research telescopes of Australian National University's &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory\"&gt;Mount Stromlo Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout 2013, several events celebrated the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra. On 11 March 2014, the last day of the centennial year, the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Centenary%20Column\"&gt;Canberra Centenary Column&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled in &lt;a href=\"City%20Hill\"&gt;City Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Other works included \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skywhale\"&gt;The Skywhale&lt;/a&gt;\", a hot air balloon designed by the sculptor &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Piccinini\"&gt;Patricia Piccinini&lt;/a&gt;, and \"StellrScope\" by visual media artist Eleanor Gates-Stuart. On 7 February 2021, \"The Skywhale\" was joined by \"Skywhalepapa\" to create a \"Skywhale family\", an event marked by Skywhale-themed pastries and beer produced by local companies as well as an &lt;a href=\"art%20pop\"&gt;art pop&lt;/a&gt; song entitled \"We are the Skywhales\".\nIn 2014, Canberra was named the best city to live in the world by the &lt;a href=\"OECD\"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt;, and was named the third best city to visit in the world by &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Planet\"&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.\nGeography.\nCanberra covers an area of and is located near the &lt;a href=\"Brindabella%20Ranges\"&gt;Brindabella Ranges&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Alps\"&gt;Australian Alps&lt;/a&gt;), approximately inland from &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Australia's east coast&lt;/a&gt;. It has an elevation of approximately &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Height%20Datum\"&gt;AHD&lt;/a&gt;; the highest point is &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Majura\"&gt;Mount Majura&lt;/a&gt; at . Other low mountains include &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Taylor%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29\"&gt;Mount Taylor&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ainslie\"&gt;Mount Ainslie&lt;/a&gt; , Mount Mugga Mugga and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29\"&gt;Black Mountain&lt;/a&gt; .\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly &lt;a href=\"eucalyptus\"&gt;eucalypt&lt;/a&gt; species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including \"&lt;a href=\"Pinus%20radiata\"&gt;Pinus radiata&lt;/a&gt;\" on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.\nThe urban environs of the city of Canberra straddle the &lt;a href=\"Ginninderra\"&gt;Ginninderra plain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molonglo%20plain\"&gt;Molonglo plain&lt;/a&gt;, the Limestone plain, and the &lt;a href=\"Tuggeranong\"&gt;Tuggeranong plain&lt;/a&gt; (Isabella's Plain). The &lt;a href=\"Molonglo%20River\"&gt;Molonglo River&lt;/a&gt; which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital's iconic feature &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Lake Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt;. The Molonglo then flows into the &lt;a href=\"Murrumbidgee%20River\"&gt;Murrumbidgee&lt;/a&gt; north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The &lt;a href=\"Queanbeyan%20River\"&gt;Queanbeyan River&lt;/a&gt; joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.\nA number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ginninderra\"&gt;Ginninderra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Tuggeranong\"&gt;Tuggeranong&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently the Molonglo River had a history of sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.\nClimate.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification&lt;/a&gt;, Canberra has an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cfb\"). In January, the warmest month, the average high is approximately ; however, in July, the coldest month, the average high drops to approximately .\nFrost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district) due to being on the &lt;a href=\"leeward\"&gt;leeward&lt;/a&gt; (eastern) side of the range, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped &lt;a href=\"Brindabella%20Range\"&gt;Brindabella Range&lt;/a&gt; can be seen from the CBD. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968. Canberra is often affected by &lt;a href=\"foehn\"&gt;foehn&lt;/a&gt; winds, especially in winter, evident by its anomalously warm maxima relative to altitude.\nThe highest recorded maximum temperature was on 4 January 2020. Winter 2011 was Canberra's warmest winter on record, approximately above the average temperature. \nThe lowest recorded minimum temperature was on the morning of 11 July 1971. Light snow falls only once or twice per year, and it is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates.\nCanberra is protected from the west by the &lt;a href=\"Brindabellas\"&gt;Brindabellas&lt;/a&gt; which create a strong rain shadow in Canberra's valleys. Canberra gets 100.4 clear days annually. Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hobart\"&gt;Hobart&lt;/a&gt;) and is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s occur mostly between October and April, owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is generally sheltered from a westerly wind, though strong northwesterlies can develop. A cool, vigorous afternoon easterly change, colloquially referred to as a 'sea-breeze' or the 'Braidwood Butcher', is common during the summer months and often exceeds 40\u00a0km/h in the city. Canberra is also less humid than the nearby coastal areas.\nSmoke haze became synonymous with the 2019/2020 Australian summer. On 1 January 2020, Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).\nUrban structure.\nCanberra is a &lt;a href=\"New%20town\"&gt;planned city&lt;/a&gt; and the inner-city area was originally designed by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Walter Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.\nLake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Capital Hill&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the eventual location of the new &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt; on a mound on the southern side\u2014north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along &lt;a href=\"Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Anzac Parade&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ainslie\"&gt;Mount Ainslie&lt;/a&gt;. At the southwestern end of the land axis was &lt;a href=\"Bimberi%20Peak\"&gt;Bimberi Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately south west of Canberra.\nThe straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29\"&gt;Black Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Constitution Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, which links &lt;a href=\"City%20Hill%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;City Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Civic Centre&lt;/a&gt; and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Commonwealth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kings%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Kings Avenue&lt;/a&gt; were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20Triangle\"&gt;Parliamentary Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.\nThe Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Red Hill&lt;/a&gt; and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Hughes\"&gt;Billy Hughes&lt;/a&gt; after the war ended.\nThe urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:\nThe Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs. In 1967 the then &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission\"&gt;National Capital Development Commission&lt;/a&gt; adopted the \"Y Plan\" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y, with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.\nDevelopment in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised, but also voices in support of planning consistent with the original 'bush capital' and 'urban forest' ideals that underpin Canberra's design.\nMany of Canberra's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Canberra%20suburbs\"&gt;suburbs&lt;/a&gt; are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. &lt;a href=\"Street%20name\"&gt;Street name&lt;/a&gt;s typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of &lt;a href=\"Duffy%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Duffy&lt;/a&gt; are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of &lt;a href=\"Dunlop%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of &lt;a href=\"Page%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Page&lt;/a&gt; are named after biologists and naturalists. Most &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20mission\"&gt;diplomatic mission&lt;/a&gt;s are located in the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Yarralumla%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Yarralumla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deakin%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Deakin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"O%27Malley%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;O'Malley&lt;/a&gt;. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Fyshwick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hume%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Hume&lt;/a&gt;.\nSustainability and the environment.\nThe average Canberran was responsible for 13.7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005. In 2012, the ACT Government legislated &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas\"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; targets to reduce its emissions by 40\u00a0per\u00a0cent from 1990 levels by 2020, 80\u00a0per\u00a0cent by 2050, with no net emissions by\u00a02060. The government announced in 2013 a target for 90% of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020, and in 2016 set an ambitious target of 100% by 2020.\nIn 1996 Canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of &lt;a href=\"zero%20waste\"&gt;no waste&lt;/a&gt;, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion. The strategy aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Plastic%20bags\"&gt;Plastic bags&lt;/a&gt; made of &lt;a href=\"polyethylene\"&gt;polyethylene&lt;/a&gt; polymer with a thickness of less than 35\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%C2%B5m\"&gt;\u00b5m&lt;/a&gt; were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November 2011. The ban was introduced by the ACT Government in an effort to make Canberra more sustainable.\nOf all waste produced in the ACT, 75\u00a0per\u00a0cent is &lt;a href=\"recycled\"&gt;recycled&lt;/a&gt;. Average household &lt;a href=\"food%20waste\"&gt;food waste&lt;/a&gt; in the ACT remains above the Australian average, costing an average $641\u00a0per\u00a0household per\u00a0annum.\nCanberra's annual &lt;a href=\"Floriade%20%28Canberra%29\"&gt;Floriade&lt;/a&gt; festival features a large display of flowers every Spring in &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Park\"&gt;Commonwealth Park&lt;/a&gt;. The organisers of the event have a strong environmental standpoint, promoting and using &lt;a href=\"green%20energy\"&gt;green energy&lt;/a&gt;, \"green catering\", &lt;a href=\"sustainability\"&gt;sustainable paper&lt;/a&gt;, the conservation and saving of water. The event is also smoke-free.\nGovernment and politics.\nTerritory government.\nThere is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; performs the roles of both a &lt;a href=\"city%20council\"&gt;city council&lt;/a&gt; for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory. However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government.\nThe assembly consists of 25 members elected from five districts using proportional representation. The five districts are &lt;a href=\"Brindabella%20electorate\"&gt;Brindabella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ginninderra%20electorate\"&gt;Ginninderra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurrajong%20electorate\"&gt;Kurrajong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murrumbidgee%20electorate\"&gt;Murrumbidgee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yerrabi%20electorate\"&gt;Yerrabi&lt;/a&gt;, which each elect five members. The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet.\nWhereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly and were in government during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001. Labor took back control of the Assembly in 2001. At the 2004 election, Chief Minister &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Stanhope\"&gt;Jon Stanhope&lt;/a&gt; and the Labor Party won 9 of the 17 seats allowing them to form the ACT's first majority government. Since 2008, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens. , the Chief Minister was Andrew Barr from the Australian Labor Party.\nThe Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Authority\"&gt;National Capital Authority&lt;/a&gt; which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin's plan for the city, such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park). The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the \"&lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20%28Self-Government%29%20Act%201988\"&gt;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988&lt;/a&gt;\". This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.\nFederal representation.\nThe ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949 when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Division of Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;. However, the ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats and the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution. At the 2019 election, the third seat has been reintroduced as the &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Bean\"&gt;Division of Bean&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor and usually by comfortable margins. The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; at every federal election since 1990 and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one Senate seat each.\nJudiciary and policing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Federal%20Police\"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces, under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government. The AFP does so through its community policing arm &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Policing\"&gt;ACT Policing&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople who have been charged with offences are tried either in the &lt;a href=\"Magistrates%20Court%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;ACT Magistrates Court&lt;/a&gt; or, for more severe offences, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;ACT Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in &lt;a href=\"Remand%20%28detention%29\"&gt;remand&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Belconnen%20Remand%20Centre\"&gt;Belconnen Remand Centre&lt;/a&gt; in the ACT but usually imprisoned in New South Wales. The &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Maconochie%20Centre\"&gt;Alexander Maconochie Centre&lt;/a&gt; was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Stanhope\"&gt;Jon Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;. The total cost for construction was $130\u00a0million. The &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Civil%20and%20Administrative%20Tribunal\"&gt;ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; deal with minor civil law actions and other various legal matters.\nCanberra has the lowest rate of crime of any capital city in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; . the most common crimes in the ACT were property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and &lt;a href=\"motor%20vehicle%20theft\"&gt;motor vehicle theft&lt;/a&gt;. They affected 2,304 and 966 people (580 and 243 per 100,000 persons respectively). &lt;a href=\"Homicide\"&gt;Homicide&lt;/a&gt; and related offences\u2014murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, but excluding driving causing death and conspiracy to murder\u2014affect 1.0 per 100,000 persons, which is below the national average of 1.9 per 100,000. Rates of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20assault\"&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; (64.4 per 100,000 persons) are also below the national average (98.5 per 100,000). However the 2017 crime statistics showed a rise in some types of personal crime, notably burglaries, thefts and assaults.\nEconomy.\nIn February 2020, the unemployment rate in Canberra was 2.9% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is &lt;a href=\"Australian%20dollar\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1827 compared with the national average of $1658 (November 2019).\nThe median house price in Canberra as of February 2020 was $745,000, lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005. The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As of January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country. Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.\nThe city's main industry is public administration and safety, which accounted for 27.1% of Gross Territory Product in 2018-19 and employed 32.49% of Canberra's workforce. The headquarters of many &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Public%20Service\"&gt;Australian Public Service&lt;/a&gt; agencies are located in Canberra, and Canberra is also host to several &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; establishments, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and , which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multi-user depot. Other major sectors by employment include Health Care (10.54%), Professional Services (9.77%), Education and Training (9.64%), Retail (7.27%), Accommodation &amp; Food (6.39%) and Construction (5.80%).\nThe former &lt;a href=\"Fairbairn%20Airbase\"&gt;RAAF Fairbairn&lt;/a&gt;, adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Airport\"&gt;Canberra Airport&lt;/a&gt; was sold to the operators of the airport, but the base continues to be used for &lt;a href=\"RAAF\"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; VIP flights. A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to capitalise on the concentration of government customers; these include &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Software\"&gt;Tower Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RuleBurst\"&gt;RuleBurst&lt;/a&gt;. A consortium of private and government investors is making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region. A Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node was established in 2019 to grow the ACT's cyber security sector and related space, defence and education industries.\nDemographics.\nAt the , the population of Canberra was 395,790, up from 355,596 at the and 322,036 at the .\nCanberrans are relatively young, highly &lt;a href=\"Population%20mobility\"&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; and well educated. The median age is 35 years and only 12.7% of the population is aged over 65 years. Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city. As at May 2017, 43% of ACT residents (25\u201364) had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;, significantly higher that the national average of 31%.\nAccording to statistics collected by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Australia%20Bank\"&gt;National Australia Bank&lt;/a&gt; and reported in \"The Canberra Times\", Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.\nAncestry and immigration.\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: \nThe 2016 census showed that 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20to%20Australia\"&gt;born overseas&lt;/a&gt;. Of inhabitants born outside Australia, the most prevalent countries of birth were England, China, India, New Zealand and the Philippines.\n1.6% of the population, or 6,476 people, identified as &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal Australians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islanders\"&gt;Torres Strait Islanders&lt;/a&gt;) in 2016.\nLanguage.\nAt the 2016 census, 72.7% of people spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Mandarin\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt; (3.1%), &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20language\"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt; (1.1%), &lt;a href=\"Cantonese\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt; (1%), &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; (0.9%) and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; (0.8%).\nReligion.\nOn census night in 2016, approximately 50.0% of ACT residents described themselves as Christian (excluding not stated responses), the most common denominations being &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt;; 36.2% described themselves as having no religion.\nCulture.\nEducation.\nThe two main tertiary institutions are the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20University\"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; (ANU) in &lt;a href=\"Acton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Acton&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Canberra\"&gt;University of Canberra&lt;/a&gt; (UC) in &lt;a href=\"Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times%20Higher%20Education%20Supplement\"&gt;The Times Higher Education Supplement&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of &lt;a href=\"Watson%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt; is a campus of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Catholic%20University\"&gt;Australian Catholic University&lt;/a&gt;; St Mark's Theological College in &lt;a href=\"Barton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Barton&lt;/a&gt; is part of the secular &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Sturt%20University\"&gt;Charles Sturt University&lt;/a&gt;. The ACT Government announced on 5 March 2020 that the CIT campus and an adjoining carpark in &lt;a href=\"Reid%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Reid&lt;/a&gt; would be leased to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; (UNSW) for a &lt;a href=\"peppercorn%20lease\"&gt;peppercorn lease&lt;/a&gt;, for it to develop as a campus for a new UNSW Canberra. UNSW released a master plan in 2021 for a 6,000 student campus to be realised over 15 years at a cost of $1 billion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20College\"&gt;Australian Defence College&lt;/a&gt; has two campuses: the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC) plus the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies (CDSS) at &lt;a href=\"Weston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Weston&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy\"&gt;Australian Defence Force Academy&lt;/a&gt; (ADFA) beside the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon\"&gt;Royal Military College, Duntroon&lt;/a&gt; located in the inner-northern suburb of &lt;a href=\"Campbell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and &lt;a href=\"Quaternary%20education\"&gt;postgraduates&lt;/a&gt; and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;; Duntroon provides &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Army\"&gt;Australian Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt; training.\nTertiary level vocational education is also available through the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Canberra Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (CIT), with campuses in &lt;a href=\"Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;, Reid, &lt;a href=\"Gungahlin\"&gt;Gungahlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuggeranong%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Tuggernong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Fyshwick&lt;/a&gt;. The combined enrolment of the CIT campuses was over 28,000 students in 2019. Following the transfer of land in Reid for the new UNSW Canberra, a new CIT &lt;a href=\"Woden%20Valley\"&gt;Woden&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to be completed by 2025.\nIn 2016 there were 132 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20schools%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its \"Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools\" policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006\u201308 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6\u00a0per\u00a0cent of ACT enrollments.\nArts and entertainment.\nCanberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Institute%20of%20Aboriginal%20and%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Studies\"&gt;Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Gallery of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Library%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Library&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Archives%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Archives&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Academy%20of%20Science\"&gt;Australian Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20and%20Sound%20Archive\"&gt;National Film and Sound Archive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public, including &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Mint\"&gt;Royal Australian Mint&lt;/a&gt;.\nLake Burley Griffin is the site of the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20James%20Cook%20Memorial\"&gt;Captain James Cook Memorial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Carillon\"&gt;National Carillon&lt;/a&gt;. Other sites of interest include the &lt;a href=\"Australian%E2%80%93American%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian\u2013American Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Park\"&gt;Commonwealth Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Place%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Commonwealth Place&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Telstra%20Tower\"&gt;Telstra Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20Botanic%20Gardens\"&gt;Australian National Botanic Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Zoo%20and%20Aquarium\"&gt;National Zoo and Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Dinosaur%20Museum\"&gt;National Dinosaur Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"National%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Centre%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Questacon \u2013 the National Science and Technology Centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Museum%20and%20Gallery\"&gt;Canberra Museum and Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; is a repository of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions. Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the &lt;a href=\"Tuggeranong\"&gt;Tuggeranong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Mugga-Mugga in &lt;a href=\"Symonston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Symonston&lt;/a&gt;, and Blundells' Cottage in &lt;a href=\"Parkes%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Parkes&lt;/a&gt; all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers. &lt;a href=\"Calthorpes%27%20House\"&gt;Calthorpes' House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Red Hill&lt;/a&gt; is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days. &lt;a href=\"Strathnairn%20Homestead%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Strathnairn Homestead&lt;/a&gt; is an historic building which also dates from the 1920s.\nCanberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Theatre\"&gt;Canberra Theatre and Playhouse&lt;/a&gt; which hosts many major concerts and productions; and Llewellyn Hall (within the &lt;a href=\"ANU%20School%20of%20Music\"&gt;ANU School of Music&lt;/a&gt;), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable. The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings. &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Hall%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;The Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefest\"&gt;Stonefest&lt;/a&gt; was a large annual festival, for some years one of the biggest festivals in Canberra. It was downsized and rebranded as Stone Day in 2012. There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment, particularly concentrated in the areas of &lt;a href=\"Dickson%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Dickson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt;. Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema, and they all have a library. Popular cultural events include the &lt;a href=\"National%20Folk%20Festival%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;National Folk Festival&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canberra%20Show\"&gt;Royal Canberra Show&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Summernats\"&gt;Summernats&lt;/a&gt; car festival, &lt;a href=\"Enlighten%20Canberra\"&gt;Enlighten&lt;/a&gt; festival, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Multicultural%20Festival\"&gt;National Multicultural Festival&lt;/a&gt; in February and the \"Celebrate Canberra\" festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day.\nCanberra maintains sister-city relationships with both &lt;a href=\"Nara%2C%20Nara\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt;, Japan and Beijing, China. Canberra has friendship-city relationships with both &lt;a href=\"Dili\"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, East Timor and &lt;a href=\"Hangzhou\"&gt;Hangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, China. City-to-city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities. The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring, is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship. The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.\nMedia.\nAs Australia's capital, Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia's political reportage and thus all the major media, including the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the commercial television networks, and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus. News organisations are represented in the \"&lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Press%20Gallery\"&gt;press gallery&lt;/a&gt;\", a group of journalists who report on the national &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Australia\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;. The National Press Club of Australia in &lt;a href=\"Barton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Barton&lt;/a&gt; has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest, typically a politician or other public figure, delivers a speech followed by a question-and-answer session.\nCanberra has a daily newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Canberra%20Times\"&gt;The Canberra Times&lt;/a&gt;\", which was established in 1926. There are also several free weekly publications, including news magazines \"CityNews\" and \"Canberra Weekly\" as well as entertainment guide \"&lt;a href=\"BMA%20Magazine\"&gt;BMA Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\". \"BMA Magazine\" first went to print in 1992; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the &lt;a href=\"Nirvana%20%28band%29\"&gt;Nirvana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nevermind\"&gt;Nevermind&lt;/a&gt; tour.\nThere are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Canberra (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20radio%20station%20callsigns%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;AM/FM Listing&lt;/a&gt;). The main commercial operators are the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Capital Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2CA\"&gt;2CA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2CC\"&gt;2CC&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Austereo\"&gt;Austereo&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Australian%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;ARN&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"104.7%20%28Canberra%29\"&gt;104.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mix%20106.3\"&gt;Mix 106.3&lt;/a&gt;). There are also several community operated stations.\nA DAB+ digital radio trial is also in operation, it simulcasts some of the AM/FM stations, and also provides several digital only stations (&lt;a href=\"Digital%20radio%20in%20Australia%23Canberra\"&gt;DAB+ Trial Listing&lt;/a&gt;).\nFive free-to-air television stations service Canberra:\nEach station broadcasts a primary channel and several &lt;a href=\"Digital%20terrestrial%20television%20in%20Australia%23Additional%20channels\"&gt;multichannels&lt;/a&gt;. Of the three main commercial networks:\nPrior to 1989, Canberra was serviced by just the ABC, SBS and Capital Television (CTC), which later became Southern Cross Nine, with Prime Television (now Prime7) and WIN Television arriving as part of the Government's regional aggregation program in that year.\n&lt;a href=\"Pay%20television\"&gt;Pay television&lt;/a&gt; services are available from &lt;a href=\"Foxtel\"&gt;Foxtel&lt;/a&gt; (via satellite) and telecommunications company &lt;a href=\"TransACT\"&gt;TransACT&lt;/a&gt; (via cable).\nSport.\nIn addition to local sporting leagues, Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions. The best known teams are the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Raiders\"&gt;Canberra Raiders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brumbies\"&gt;Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; who play &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; respectively; both have been champions of their leagues. Both teams play their home games at &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Stadium\"&gt;Canberra Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which is the city's largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in soccer for the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2000 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and in rugby union for the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2003 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The city also has a successful basketball team, the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Capitals\"&gt;Canberra Capitals&lt;/a&gt;, which has won seven out of the last eleven &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20League\"&gt;national women's basketball&lt;/a&gt; titles. &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20United%20FC\"&gt;Canberra United FC&lt;/a&gt; represents the city in the &lt;a href=\"W-League%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;W-League&lt;/a&gt;, the national &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20association%20football\"&gt;women's association football&lt;/a&gt; league, and were champions in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20W-League\"&gt;2011\u201312 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Vikings\"&gt;Canberra Vikings&lt;/a&gt; represent the city in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;National Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt; and finished second in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20National%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;2015 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also teams that participate in national competitions in &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Bank%20Trophy\"&gt;netball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Ice%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futures%20League\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe historic &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%27s%20XI\"&gt;Prime Minister's XI&lt;/a&gt; cricket match is played at &lt;a href=\"Manuka%20Oval\"&gt;Manuka Oval&lt;/a&gt; annually. Other significant annual sporting events include the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Marathon\"&gt;Canberra Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\nCanberra has been bidding for an &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Australian Football League&lt;/a&gt; club since 1981 when &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; was more popular. While the league has knocked back numerous proposals, according to the AFL Canberra belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Western%20Sydney%20Giants\"&gt;Greater Western Sydney Giants&lt;/a&gt; who play three home games at Manuka Oval each season.\nOther significant annual sporting events include the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Marathon\"&gt;Canberra Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport\"&gt;Australian Institute of Sport&lt;/a&gt; (AIS) is located in the Canberra suburb of &lt;a href=\"Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;. The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports. The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes, both local and international. The majority of Australia's team members and medallists at the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2000 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney were AIS graduates.\nCanberra has numerous sporting ovals, golf courses, skate parks, and swimming pools that are open to the public. Tennis courts include those at the National Sports Club, &lt;a href=\"Lyneham%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Lyneham&lt;/a&gt;, former home of the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Women%27s%20Tennis%20Classic\"&gt;Canberra Women's Tennis Classic&lt;/a&gt;. A Canberra-wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes. Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths, horse and mountain bike trails. Water sports like sailing, rowing, dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra's lakes. The &lt;a href=\"Rally%20of%20Canberra\"&gt;Rally of Canberra&lt;/a&gt; is an annual motor sport event, and from 2000 to 2002, Canberra hosted the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20400\"&gt;Canberra 400&lt;/a&gt; event for &lt;a href=\"V8%20Supercars\"&gt;V8 Supercars&lt;/a&gt; on the temporary &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Street%20Circuit\"&gt;Canberra Street Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, which was located inside the Parliamentary Triangle.\nA popular form of exercise for people working near or in the Parliamentary Triangle is to do the \"bridge to bridge walk/run\" of about 5\u00a0km around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Lake Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, crossing the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Commonwealth Avenue Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kings%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;Kings Avenue Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, using the paths beside the lake. The walk takes about 1 hour, making it ideal for a lunchtime excursion. This is also popular on weekends. Such was the popularity during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2020%20coronavirus%20pandemic%20in%20Australia%23Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;isolation in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that the ACT Government initiated a 'Clockwise is COVID-wise' rule for walkers and runners.\nInfrastructure.\nHealth.\nCanberra has two large public hospitals, the approximately 600-bed &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Hospital\"&gt;Canberra Hospital&lt;/a&gt;\u2014formerly the Woden Valley Hospital\u2014in &lt;a href=\"Garran%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Garran&lt;/a&gt; and the 174-bed Calvary Public Hospital in &lt;a href=\"Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;. Both are teaching institutions. The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in &lt;a href=\"Deakin%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Deakin&lt;/a&gt;. Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and &lt;a href=\"Healthscope\"&gt;Healthscope&lt;/a&gt;'s National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital\"&gt;Royal Canberra Hospital&lt;/a&gt; was located on &lt;a href=\"Acton%20Peninsula\"&gt;Acton Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Burley%20Griffin\"&gt;Lake Burley Griffin&lt;/a&gt;; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital%20implosion\"&gt;controversial and fatal implosion&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate construction of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Museum of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales, and &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Ambulance%20Service\"&gt;ACT Ambulance Service&lt;/a&gt; is one of four operational agencies of the &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Emergency%20Services%20Authority\"&gt;ACT Emergency Services Authority&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Newborn%20Emergency%20Transport%20Service\"&gt;NETS&lt;/a&gt; provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.\nTransport.\nThe automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.\n&lt;a href=\"Suburbs%20of%20Canberra%23Districts\"&gt;Canberra's districts&lt;/a&gt; are generally connected by &lt;a href=\"parkway\"&gt;parkway&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014limited access &lt;a href=\"dual%20carriageway\"&gt;dual carriageway&lt;/a&gt; roads with speed limits generally set at a maximum of . An example is the &lt;a href=\"Tuggeranong%20Parkway\"&gt;Tuggeranong Parkway&lt;/a&gt; which links Canberra's CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek. In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in, to deter non-local traffic from cutting through areas of housing.\nIn an effort to improve road safety, traffic cameras were first introduced to Canberra by the &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Carnell\"&gt;Kate Carnell&lt;/a&gt; Government in 1999. The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and point-to-point speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11\u00a0million per year in fines.\n&lt;a href=\"ACTION\"&gt;ACTION&lt;/a&gt;, the government-operated bus service, provides public transport throughout the city. &lt;a href=\"Qcity%20Transit\"&gt;Qcity Transit&lt;/a&gt; provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales through their &lt;a href=\"Transborder%20Express\"&gt;Transborder Express&lt;/a&gt; brand (&lt;a href=\"Murrumbateman\"&gt;Murrumbateman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Yass&lt;/a&gt;) and as Qcity Transit (&lt;a href=\"Queanbeyan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Queanbeyan&lt;/a&gt;). A &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Metro%2C%20Canberra\"&gt;light rail line&lt;/a&gt; commenced service on 20 April 2019 linking the CBD with the northern district of &lt;a href=\"Gungahlin\"&gt;Gungahlin&lt;/a&gt;. A planned Stage 2A of Canberra's light rail network will run from Alinga Street station to Commonwealth Park, adding three new stops at City West, City South and Commonwealth Park. In February 2021 ACT Minister for Transport and City Services Chris Steel said he expects construction on Stage 2A to commence in the 2021-22 financial year, and for \u201ctracks to be laid\u201d by the next Territory election in 2024. At the 2016 census, 7.1% of the journeys to work involved public transport, while 4.5% walked to work.\nThere are two local taxi companies. &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20Consolidated%20Transport\"&gt;Aerial Capital Group&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of Cabxpress in 2007. In October 2015 the ACT Government passed legislation to regulate ride sharing, allowing ride share services including &lt;a href=\"Uber\"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; to operate legally in Canberra. The ACT Government was the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact legislation to regulate the service. Since then many other ride sharing and taxi services have started in ACT namely &lt;a href=\"Ola%20Cabs\"&gt;Ola&lt;/a&gt;, Glide Taxi and GoCatch\nAn interstate &lt;a href=\"NSW%20TrainLink\"&gt;NSW TrainLink&lt;/a&gt; railway service connects Canberra to Sydney. &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20railway%20station\"&gt;Canberra's railway station&lt;/a&gt; is in the inner south suburb of &lt;a href=\"Kingston%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt, while plans for a line to &lt;a href=\"Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Yass&lt;/a&gt; were abandoned. A gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the &lt;a href=\"Yarralumla%20brickworks\"&gt;Yarralumla brickworks&lt;/a&gt; and the provisional Parliament House; it was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in May 1927. Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a NSW TrainLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass, about a one-hour drive from Canberra.\nPlans to establish a &lt;a href=\"High-speed%20rail%20in%20Australia\"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt; service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, have not been implemented, as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable. The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city, however none eventuated. The phase 2 report of the most recent proposal, the &lt;a href=\"High-speed%20rail%20in%20Australia%23High-speed%20rail%20on%20the%20east%20coast%20of%20Australia\"&gt;High Speed \nRail Study&lt;/a&gt;, was published by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Infrastructure%20and%20Transport\"&gt;Department of Infrastructure and Transport&lt;/a&gt; on 11 April 2013. A railway connecting Canberra to &lt;a href=\"Jervis%20Bay\"&gt;Jervis Bay&lt;/a&gt; was also planned but never constructed.\nCanberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Federal Highway&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 23), which connects with the &lt;a href=\"Hume%20Highway\"&gt;Hume Highway&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 31) near &lt;a href=\"Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Goulburn&lt;/a&gt;, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the &lt;a href=\"Barton%20Highway\"&gt;Barton Highway&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two-hour drive on the &lt;a href=\"Monaro%20Highway\"&gt;Monaro Highway&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Mountains\"&gt;Snowy Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kosciuszko%20National%20Park\"&gt;Kosciuszko National Park&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Batemans%20Bay\"&gt;Batemans Bay&lt;/a&gt;, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the &lt;a href=\"Kings%20Highway%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Kings Highway&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Airport\"&gt;Canberra Airport&lt;/a&gt; provides direct domestic services to &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20Airport\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Airport\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairns%20Airport\"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darwin%20Airport\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Airport\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Airport\"&gt;Hobart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Airport\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perth%20Airport\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Coast%20Airport\"&gt;Sunshine Coast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Airport\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; with connections to other domestic centres. There are also direct flights to small regional towns: &lt;a href=\"Ballina%20Byron%20Gateway%20Airport\"&gt;Ballina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dubbo%20City%20Airport\"&gt;Dubbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Airport%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Macquarie%20Airport\"&gt;Port Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. Regular commercial international flights operate to &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doha\"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;. Canberra Airport is, as of September 2013, designated by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Infrastructure%20and%20Regional%20Development\"&gt;Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development&lt;/a&gt; as a restricted use designated international airport. Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with &lt;a href=\"Fairbairn%20airbase\"&gt;RAAF Base Fairbairn&lt;/a&gt;. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control.\nCanberra has one of the highest rates of active travel of all Australian major cities, with 7.1\u00a0per\u00a0cent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011. An ACT Government survey conducted in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26\u00a0minutes each day. According to \"The Canberra Times\" in March 2014, Canberra's cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week. The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87,000 cyclists, translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia; and, with higher popularity, bike injury rates in 2012 were twice the national average.\nUtilities.\nThe government-owned &lt;a href=\"ACTEW%20Corporation\"&gt;ACTEW Corporation&lt;/a&gt; manages Canberra's water and sewerage infrastructure. &lt;a href=\"ActewAGL\"&gt;ActewAGL&lt;/a&gt; is a joint venture between ACTEW and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Gas%20Light%20Company\"&gt;AGL&lt;/a&gt;, and is the retail provider of Canberra's utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary &lt;a href=\"TransACT\"&gt;TransACT&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanberra's water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the &lt;a href=\"Cotter%20River\"&gt;Cotter River&lt;/a&gt; and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales, it is managed by the ACT government. ACTEW Corporation owns Canberra's two wastewater treatment plants, located at &lt;a href=\"Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Fyshwick&lt;/a&gt; and on the lower reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Molonglo%20River\"&gt;Molonglo River&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Electricity for Canberra&lt;/a&gt; mainly comes from the national power grid through substations at &lt;a href=\"Holt%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Holt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Fyshwick&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"Queanbeyan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Queanbeyan&lt;/a&gt;). Power was first supplied from the &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20Powerhouse\"&gt;Kingston Powerhouse&lt;/a&gt; near the Molonglo River, a thermal plant built in 1913, but this was finally closed in 1957. The ACT has four solar farms, which were opened between 2014 and 2017: &lt;a href=\"Royalla%20Solar%20Farm\"&gt;Royalla&lt;/a&gt; (rated output of 20 megawatts, 2014), &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Majura%20Solar%20Farm\"&gt;Mount Majura&lt;/a&gt; (2.3 MW, 2016), &lt;a href=\"Mugga%20Lane%20Solar%20Park\"&gt;Mugga Lane&lt;/a&gt; (13 MW, 2017) and &lt;a href=\"Williamsdale%20Solar%20Farm\"&gt;Williamsdale&lt;/a&gt; (11 MW, 2017). In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. In 2015/16, rooftop solar systems supported by the ACT government's feed-in tariff had a capacity of 26.3 megawatts, producing 34,910 MWh. In the same year, retailer-supported schemes had a capacity of 25.2 megawatts and exported 28,815 MWh to the grid (power consumed locally was not recorded).\nThere are no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Capital Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020, raising the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these are expected to be operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available for the establishment of a facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.\nThe ACT has the highest rate with internet access at home (94\u00a0per\u00a0cent of households in 2014\u201315).\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nCanberra has three &lt;a href=\"sister%20city\"&gt;sister cities&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn addition, Canberra has the following friendship cities:"
