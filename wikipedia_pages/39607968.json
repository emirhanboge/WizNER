He married Margaret, sister of Sir &lt;a href=\"Rhys%20ap%20Thomas\"&gt;Rhys ap Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. They had two sons: Sir William Herbert of Coldbrook, and Sir Richard Herbert of Powys. His great-grandson, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Herbert%20of%20Chirbury\"&gt;Edward Herbert&lt;/a&gt;, was raised to the peerage in 1629.\nLike many members of the Welsh gentry, Herbert was a notable &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;ic patron. He was the principal patron of &lt;a href=\"Ieuan%20Deulwyn\"&gt;Ieuan Deulwyn&lt;/a&gt;, and was also a patron of &lt;a href=\"Guto%27r%20Glyn\"&gt;Guto'r Glyn&lt;/a&gt; as well as others. He hosted a bardic debate at Coldbrook House between Deulwyn and &lt;a href=\"Bedo%20Brwynllys\"&gt;Bedo Brwynllys&lt;/a&gt;. He was eulogized by Ieuan Deulwyn, Bedo Brwynllys, &lt;a href=\"Hywel%20Dafi\"&gt;Hywel Dafi&lt;/a&gt;, and (jointly with his brother William) &lt;a href=\"Huw%20Cae%20Llwyd\"&gt;Huw Cae Llwyd&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike his brother, he was a supporter of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;House of York&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;. He fought alongside his brother at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Edgecote%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Edgecote Moor&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Lancastrian&lt;/a&gt; victory), where he was captured and executed. He is interred with his wife at &lt;a href=\"Priory%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Abergavenny\"&gt;Abergavenny Priory&lt;/a&gt;, near other members of his family."
