    "text": "St. Cloud is a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and the largest population center in the state's &lt;a href=\"Central%20Minnesota\"&gt;central region&lt;/a&gt;. Its population is 68,462 according to the 2019 US census estimates, making it Minnesota's tenth largest city. St. Cloud is the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stearns%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Stearns County&lt;/a&gt; and was named after the city of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Cloud\"&gt;Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (in \u00cele-de-France, near Paris), which was named after the 6th-century French monk &lt;a href=\"Clodoald\"&gt;Clodoald&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough mostly in Stearns County, St. Cloud also extends into &lt;a href=\"Benton%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Benton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sherburne%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Sherburne&lt;/a&gt; counties, and straddles the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. It is the center of contiguous &lt;a href=\"St.%20Cloud%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Waite%20Park%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Waite Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sauk%20Rapids%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Sauk Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sartell%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Sartell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockville%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Rockville&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Augusta%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Augusta&lt;/a&gt; directly bordering the city, and &lt;a href=\"Foley%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Foley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rice%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kimball%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Kimball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clearwater%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Clearwater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Clear Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spring%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Cold Spring&lt;/a&gt; nearby. The St. Cloud metropolitan area had a population of 202,996 at the 2020 census. It has been listed as the fifth-largest metro with a presence in Minnesota, behind &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis%E2%80%93St.%20Paul\"&gt;Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duluth%E2%80%93Superior\"&gt;Duluth\u2013Superior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fargo-Moorhead\"&gt;Fargo-Moorhead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;. But the entire St. Cloud area is entirely in Minnesota, while most of Fargo-Moorhead's population is in North Dakota and Superior, Wisconsin, contributes significant population to the Duluth area.\nSt. Cloud is northwest of the Twin Cities of &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis%E2%80%93St.%20Paul\"&gt;Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul&lt;/a&gt; along &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2094%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;Interstate 94&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2052%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;U.S. Highway 52&lt;/a&gt; (conjoined with I-94), &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;U.S. Highway 10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2015\"&gt;Minnesota State Highway 15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2023\"&gt;Minnesota State Highway 23&lt;/a&gt;. The St. Cloud &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; (MSA) is made up of Stearns and Benton Counties. The city was included in a newly defined Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013St. Cloud Combined Statistical Area (CSA) in 2000. St. Cloud as a whole has never been part of the 13-county MSA comprising &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloomington%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Bloomington&lt;/a&gt; and parts of western &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"St.%20Cloud%20State%20University\"&gt;St. Cloud State University&lt;/a&gt;, Minnesota's third-largest public university, is located between the downtown area and the Beaver Islands, which form a maze for a two-mile stretch of the Mississippi. The approximately 30 undeveloped islands are a popular destination for kayak and canoe enthusiasts and are part of a state-designated 12-mile stretch of wild and scenic river.\nSt. Cloud owns and operates a &lt;a href=\"hydroelectricity\"&gt;hydroelectric&lt;/a&gt; dam on the Mississippi that can produce up to ten &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;megawatts&lt;/a&gt; of electricity.\nHistory.\nWhat is now the St. Cloud area was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Europeans encountered the &lt;a href=\"Odawa%20people\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ojibwe%20people\"&gt;Ojibwe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ho-Chunk\"&gt;Winnebago&lt;/a&gt; when they started to trade with Native American peoples. \nMinnesota was organized as a territory in 1849. The St. Cloud area was opened up to settlers in 1851 after treaty negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chunk\"&gt;Winnebago&lt;/a&gt; (Ho-Chunk) tribe in 1851 and 1852. John Wilson, a &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; native with French &lt;a href=\"Huguenot\"&gt;Huguenot&lt;/a&gt; ancestry and an interest in &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, named the settlement St. Cloud after &lt;a href=\"Saint-Cloud\"&gt;Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; suburb where Napoleon had his favorite palace. \nSt. Cloud was a waystation on the Middle and Woods branches of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20River%20Trails\"&gt;Red River Trails&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9tis\"&gt;M\u00e9tis&lt;/a&gt; traders between the Canada\u2013US border at &lt;a href=\"Pembina%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Pembina&lt;/a&gt;, North Dakota and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;. The cart trains often consisted of hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Red%20River%20ox%20carts\"&gt;oxcarts&lt;/a&gt;. The M\u00e9tis, bringing furs to trade for supplies to take back to their rural settlements, would camp west of the city and cross the Mississippi in St. Cloud or just to the north in Sauk Rapids\nThe City of St. Cloud was incorporated in 1856. It developed from three distinct settlements, known as Upper Town, Middle Town, and Lower Town, that were established by European-American settlers starting in 1853. Remnants of the deep ravines that separated the three are still visible today. Middle Town was settled primarily by Catholic &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; immigrants and migrants from eastern states, who were recruited to the region by Father &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Xavier%20Pierz\"&gt;Francis Xavier Pierz&lt;/a&gt;, a Catholic priest who also ministered as a &lt;a href=\"missionary\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; to Native Americans. Lower Town was founded by settlers from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Tier%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Northern Tier&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mid-Atlantic%20states\"&gt;mid-Atlantic states&lt;/a&gt;, including former residents of upstate New York. \nUpper Town, or Arcadia, was plotted by &lt;a href=\"General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanus%20Lowry\"&gt;Sylvanus Lowry&lt;/a&gt;, a slaveholder and trader from &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; who brought &lt;a href=\"slaves\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; with him, although Minnesota was organized as a free territory. He served on the territorial Council from 1852 to 1853 and was elected St. Cloud's first mayor in 1856, serving for one year.\n&lt;a href=\"Jane%20Grey%20Swisshelm\"&gt;Jane Grey Swisshelm&lt;/a&gt;, an abolitionist newspaper editor who had migrated from &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly attacked Lowry in print. At one point Lowry organized a \"Committee of Vigilance\" that broke into Swisshelm's newspaper office and removed her press, throwing it into the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. Lowry started a rival paper, \"The Union\".\nThe US Supreme Court's 1857 decision in \"&lt;a href=\"Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford\"&gt;Dred Scott&lt;/a&gt;\" ruled that slaves could not file &lt;a href=\"freedom%20suits\"&gt;freedom suits&lt;/a&gt; and found the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Compromise\"&gt;Missouri Compromise&lt;/a&gt; unconstitutional, so the territory's prohibition against slavery became unenforceable. Nearly all Southerners left the St. Cloud area when the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, taking their slaves with them. Lowry died in the city in 1865.\nBeginning in 1864, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Miller%20%28Minnesota%20governor%29\"&gt;Stephen Miller&lt;/a&gt; served a two-year term as Minnesota governor, the only citizen of St. Cloud ever to hold the office. Miller was a \"&lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20German\"&gt;Pennsylvania German&lt;/a&gt; businessman\", lawyer, writer, active abolitionist, and personal friend of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ramsey\"&gt;Alexander Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;. He was on the state's Republican electoral ticket with Abraham Lincoln in 1860.\n&lt;a href=\"Steamboat\"&gt;Steamboat&lt;/a&gt;s regularly docked at St. Cloud as part of the fur trade and other commerce, although river levels were not reliable. This ended with the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Coon%20Rapids%20Dam\"&gt;Coon Rapids Dam&lt;/a&gt; in 1912\u201314. &lt;a href=\"Granite\"&gt;Granite&lt;/a&gt; quarries have operated in the area since the 1880s, giving St. Cloud its nickname, \"The Granite City.\"\nIn 1917, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Pandolfo\"&gt;Samuel Pandolfo&lt;/a&gt; started the Pan Motor Company in St. Cloud. Pandolfo claimed his Pan-Cars would make St. Cloud the new &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; but the company failed at a time when resources were directed toward the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; effort. He was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to defraud investors.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.
