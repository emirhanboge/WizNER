    "text": "I Am Invincible (foaled 2004) is a &lt;a href=\"Group%20races\"&gt;stakes&lt;/a&gt; winning &lt;a href=\"Australian\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; bred thoroughbred racehorse that is most notable for his success as a stallion, having sired more than 60 individual stakes winners. \nBackground.\nI Am Invincible was purchased at the 2006 &lt;a href=\"William%20Inglis%20and%20Sons\"&gt;Inglis&lt;/a&gt; NSW Classic Twilight Session by his original trainer Toby Edmonds for owners Ray &amp; Brett Gall for the amount of &lt;a href=\"A%24\"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;62,500.\nRacing career.\nI Am Invincible won his debut race by five lengths on the 21 February 2007 at &lt;a href=\"Warwick%20Farm%20Racecourse\"&gt;Warwick Farm&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe performance convinced trainer Toby Edmonds to set the horse towards the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Slipper%20Stakes\"&gt;Golden Slipper&lt;/a&gt;. He next lined up in the &lt;a href=\"Kindergarten%20Stakes\"&gt;Kindergarten Stakes&lt;/a&gt;. Drawn near the outside in a field of 14, the horse again showed brilliant speed to cross and sit in second place before finishing a game third to the eventual Golden Slipper winner Forensics.\nInjured at his next start when down the track in the &lt;a href=\"Todman%20Stakes\"&gt;Todman Stakes&lt;/a&gt;, the horse was forced off the scene for a prolonged period. \nHe recaptured his best form as a four year-old for Victorian trainer Peter Morgan with brilliant wins in the &lt;a href=\"D.C.%20McKay%20Stakes\"&gt;D.C. McKay Stakes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Morphettville%20Racecourse\"&gt;Morphettville&lt;/a&gt; and the Sir John Monash Stakes at &lt;a href=\"Caulfield%20Racecourse\"&gt;Caulfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2009 he ran a memorable second to &lt;a href=\"Takeover%20Target\"&gt;Takeover Target&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Goodwood\"&gt;The Goodwood&lt;/a&gt;. Jockey &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Gauci\"&gt;Darren Gauci&lt;/a&gt; took him to the lead and kicked clear rounding the turn, however he was overtaken late to be beaten a length.\nStud career.\nI Am Invincible was retired from racing to stand at Yarraman Park Stud in &lt;a href=\"Scone%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Scone, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. His initial service fee was $11,000. This increased to $247,500 in 2019, making him the most expensive stallion in Australia. He has recently serviced two of Australia's greatest horses, &lt;a href=\"Winx%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Winx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Caviar\"&gt;Black Caviar&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable Progeny.\nI Am Invincible has currently sired 10 individual &lt;a href=\"Group%20One\"&gt;Group 1&lt;/a&gt; winners:\n'c = &lt;a href=\"colt%20%28horse%29\"&gt;colt&lt;/a&gt;, f = &lt;a href=\"filly\"&gt;filly&lt;/a&gt;\", g = &lt;a href=\"gelding\"&gt;gelding&lt;/a&gt;\""
