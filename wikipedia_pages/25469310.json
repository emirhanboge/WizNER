    "text": "The National Geographic Institute of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional \"Ingeniero Alfredo Obiols G\u00f3mez\"\" (IGN)) is a scientific agency of the &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;n government.\nHistory.\nIGN was created on the 29th of December 1964. In the 1930s, cartographic projects were carried out by ad hoc mapping commissions which were primarily responsible for boundary surveys. The Department of Maps and Cartography (in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Departamento de Mapas y Cartograf\u00eda\") was created in 1945 and followed by the creation of the Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional in 1964.\nIn 1982 the agency was renamed to Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Militar (IGM) after a merger with the Military Cartographic Service, and became a dependency of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Guatemala%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1998, following the demilitarisation of state institutions stipulated in the Peace Accords, the IGN was reinstated as a dependency of the Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, and became a dependency of the Ministry of Agriculture in September 2006."
