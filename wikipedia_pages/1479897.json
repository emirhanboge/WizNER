It comprises the southern third district of &lt;a href=\"Petaling%2C%20Selangor\"&gt;Petaling&lt;/a&gt;.

Subang Jaya was developed in the 1970s by &lt;a href=\"Sime%20UEP%20Properties%20Berhad\"&gt;Sime UEP Properties Berhad&lt;/a&gt;, the property development arm of the Malaysian conglomerate &lt;a href=\"Sime%20Darby\"&gt;Sime Darby&lt;/a&gt;. The site was formerly a rubber plantation called Seafield Estate under the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Majlis%20Bandaraya%20Petaling%20Jaya\"&gt;Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya&lt;/a&gt;. Construction work for the development of Subang Jaya (consists the neighbourhood of SS 12 - SS 19) began on 21 February 1976 and was concluded in 1988. Upon completion of Subang Jaya in the same year, Sime UEP began clearing land for the development of &lt;a href=\"UEP%20Subang%20Jaya\"&gt;USJ&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, &lt;a href=\"Sime%20Darby\"&gt;Sime UEP&lt;/a&gt; began the development of &lt;a href=\"Putra%20Heights\"&gt;Putra Heights&lt;/a&gt; which is located on the southern end of Subang Jaya.\nIn 1997, Subang Jaya received the status of a municipality, elevating the Petaling District Council to Subang Jaya Municipal Council. The municipal comprise the areas administered by the former Petaling District Council, as well as some areas transferred from &lt;a href=\"Petaling%20Jaya\"&gt;Petaling Jaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Puchong\"&gt;Puchong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Alam\"&gt;Shah Alam&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the MPSJ municipal holds local government authority not only in the Subang Jaya city centre, but also &lt;a href=\"UEP%20Subang%20Jaya\"&gt;USJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Putra%20Heights\"&gt;Putra Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Batu%20Tiga\"&gt;Batu Tiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandar%20Sunway\"&gt;Bandar Sunway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Puchong\"&gt;Puchong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandar%20Kinrara\"&gt;Bandar Kinrara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seri%20Kembangan\"&gt;Seri Kembangan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Balakong\"&gt;Balakong&lt;/a&gt;. In parliamentary terms, Subang Jaya's municipal area covers the parliamentary constituency of &lt;a href=\"Puchong%20%28federal%20constituency%29\"&gt;Puchong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Subang%20%28federal%20constituency%29\"&gt;Subang&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety, as well as parts of &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Raja%20%28federal%20constituency%29\"&gt;Kota Raja&lt;/a&gt; which mainly cover Putra Heights.

Subang Jaya city itself lies within the Subang constituency, while Seri Kembangan and Puchong fall within the Puchong constituency.
