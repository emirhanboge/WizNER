    "title": "Abortion in Namibia",
    "text": "Abortion in Namibia is restricted under the Abortion and Sterilisation Act of South Africa (1975), which &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; inherited at the time of Independence from &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in March 1990. The act only allows for the termination of a pregnancy in cases of serious threat to the maternal or fetal health or when the pregnancy is a result of &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"incest\"&gt;incest&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegal position.\n&lt;a href=\"Abortion\"&gt;Abortion&lt;/a&gt; is only allowed when continuing the pregnancy will:endanger the woman\u2019s life or constitute a serious threat to her physical or mental health or there must be a serious risk that the child to be born will suffer from a physical or mental defect so as to be irreparably seriously handicapped, when the foetus is alleged to have been conceived in consequence of unlawful carnal intercourse (rape or incest); or when the foetus has been conceived in consequence of illegitimate carnal intercourse and the woman is, owing to a permanent mental handicap or defect, unable to comprehend the implications of or bear the parental responsibility for the \"fruit of coitus\".In addition to the woman\u2019s doctor, two other doctors are required to certify the existence of grounds for an abortion, and the operation must be performed by a medical practitioner in a State hospital or an approved medical facility.\"\nIn a statement at the 1994 &lt;a href=\"International%20Conference%20on%20Population%20and%20Development\"&gt;International Conference on Population and Development&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, then Minister of Health and Social Services &lt;a href=\"Nickey%20Iyambo\"&gt;Nickey Iyambo&lt;/a&gt; stated: \nOn the question of abortion, the position of Namibia is that it can only be performed under strict medical supervision within the confines of the laws, which state that consent to abortion can only be given in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen it must be clearly understood that Namibia does not promote abortion as a means of family planning but as a public health issue.\nImpact of abortion restrictions.\nThe lack of &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20contraception\"&gt;emergency contraceptive&lt;/a&gt; use and access to safe legal abortions are contributing factors to the problem of abandonment of newborns, which is acknowledged to be a serious problem in the country.\nFor abortion to be as safe as possible for a woman, the procedure needs to be performed as early in pregnancy as her decision about continuing the pregnancy permits. If the process is not done accordingly and by a professional, it might lead to infertility, death or permanent injury including paralysis.\nStatistics.\nIn 2021, medical doctor David Emvula told a parliamentary hearing that 14 Namibian women had died from unsafe abortions between April 2018 and March 2012. He estimated that 7,000 unsafe abortions had been performed in 2017."
