    "text": "Missak Manouchian (&lt;a href=\"Western%20Armenian\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; ; , 1 September 1906 \u2013 21 February 1944) was a &lt;a href=\"Armenians%20in%20France\"&gt;French-Armenian&lt;/a&gt; poet and &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; activist. An &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; survivor, he moved to France from an orphanage in Lebanon in 1925. He was active in communist Armenian literary circles. During World War II, he became the military commissioner of &lt;a href=\"FTP-MOI\"&gt;FTP-MOI&lt;/a&gt;, a group consisting of European immigrants, including many Jews, in the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20region\"&gt;Paris region&lt;/a&gt; which carried out assassinations and bombings of Nazi targets. According to one author, the Manouchian group was the most active &lt;a href=\"French%20Resistance\"&gt;French Resistance&lt;/a&gt; group. Manouchian and many of his comrades were arrested in November 1943 and executed by the Nazis in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Mont-Val%C3%A9rien\"&gt;Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien&lt;/a&gt; on 21 February 1944. He is considered a hero of the French Resistance.\nEarly life.\nManouchian was born on 1 September 1906 in &lt;a href=\"Ad%C4%B1yaman\"&gt;Ad\u0131yaman&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mamuret-ul-Aziz%20Vilayet\"&gt;Mamuret-ul-Aziz Vilayet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; into an &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; peasant family. His parents were killed during the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; of 1915, but he and his brother managed to survive. In the early 1920s he settled in an &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20General%20Benevolent%20Union\"&gt;Armenian General Benevolent Union&lt;/a&gt;-run orphanage in &lt;a href=\"Jounieh\"&gt;Jounieh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Lebanon\"&gt;French protectorate&lt;/a&gt;. He acquired education there and in 1925 moved to France.\nEventually, Manouchian settled in Paris, where he took a job as a lathe operator at a &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; plant. During this period he was &lt;a href=\"Autodidacticism\"&gt;self-educated&lt;/a&gt; and often visited libraries in the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Quarter%2C%20Paris\"&gt;Latin Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the &lt;a href=\"General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28France%29\"&gt;General Confederation of Labour&lt;/a&gt; (\"Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail\", CGT), a national association of trade unions which was the first of the five major French confederations. In the early 1930s, when the world-wide economic crisis of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; set in, Missak Manouchian lost his job. Disaffected with &lt;a href=\"capitalism\"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, he began earning a meager living by posing as a model for sculptors.\nPolitical and literary career.\nIn 1934, Manouchian joined the &lt;a href=\"French%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. From 1935 to 1937 he edited the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20language\"&gt;Armenian-language&lt;/a&gt; left-wing weekly newspaper \"Zangou\", named after a &lt;a href=\"Hrazdan%20River\"&gt;river in Armenia&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper was anti-fascist, anti-&lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Revolutionary%20Federation\"&gt;Dashnak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anti-imperialist\"&gt;anti-imperialist&lt;/a&gt; and pro-Soviet.\nManouchian wrote poetry and, with an Armenian friend who used the pseudonym of S\u00e9ma (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%A9gham%20Atmadjian\"&gt;K\u00e9gham Atmadjian&lt;/a&gt;), founded two communist-leaning literary magazines, \"Tchank\" (\"Effort\") and \"Mechagouyt\" (\"Culture\"). They published articles on French literature and Armenian culture. The two young men translated the poetry of &lt;a href=\"Baudelaire\"&gt;Baudelaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verlaine\"&gt;Verlaine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rimbaud\"&gt;Rimbaud&lt;/a&gt; into Armenian, making many of these works available in Armenian for the first time. Both Manouchian and S\u00e9ma enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"Sorbonne\"&gt;Sorbonne&lt;/a&gt; to audit courses in literature, philosophy, economics, and history.\nThe following year, he was elected secretary of the Relief Committee for Armenia (HOC), an organization associated with the &lt;a href=\"Main-d%27%C5%93uvre%20immigr%C3%A9e\"&gt;MOI&lt;/a&gt; (Immigrant Workforce Movement). At a meeting of the HOC in 1935, he met &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9lin%C3%A9e%20Manouchian\"&gt;M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Assadourian&lt;/a&gt;, who became his companion and, later, his wife.\nWorld War II.\nWhen the Second World War broke out in September 1939 Manouchian, as a foreigner, was evacuated from Paris. He found work in the &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt; area, again as a lathe-operator. After the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20France\"&gt;defeat of June 1940&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to Paris to find that his militant activities had become illegal. (French authorities had banned the Communist Party as early as September 1939.) On 22 June 1941, when the invasion of the Soviet Union by the &lt;a href=\"Nazis\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; began, Manouchian was arrested by the occupying Germans in an anti-communist round-up in Paris. Interned in a prison camp at &lt;a href=\"Compi%C3%A8gne\"&gt;Compi\u00e8gne&lt;/a&gt;, by the efforts of his wife M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Assadourian, he was released after a few weeks without being charged.\nManouchian became the political chief of the Armenian section of the underground MOI, but little is known about his activities until 1943. In February of that year, Manouchian transferred to the FTP-MOI, a group of gunmen and saboteurs attached to the MOI in Paris.\nManouchian became the leader of the FTP-MOI in June/August 1943, replacing &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Holban\"&gt;Boris Holban&lt;/a&gt;. Manouchian assumed command of three detachments, totaling about 50 fighters. The Manouchian group is credited with the assassination on 28 September 1943, of General , the assistant in France to &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20Sauckel\"&gt;Fritz Sauckel&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the mobilization and deportation of labor under the German &lt;a href=\"Service%20du%20travail%20obligatoire\"&gt;STO&lt;/a&gt; (Obligatory Work Service) in Nazi-occupied Europe. (The attack was made by the partisans &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Rayman\"&gt;Marcel Rayman&lt;/a&gt;, , and &lt;a href=\"Celestino%20Alfonso\"&gt;Celestino Alfonso&lt;/a&gt;.) The Manouchian groups carried out almost thirty successful attacks on German interests from August to November 1943. &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Aznavour\"&gt;Charles Aznavour&lt;/a&gt; and his family were members of the Manouchian resistance group, and were recognized after the war for rescuing Jews and Armenians from Nazi persecution.\nArrest and execution.\nOn 16 November 1943, the collaborationist French police forces arrested the Manouchian group at &lt;a href=\"%C3%89vry%2C%20Essonne\"&gt;\u00c9vry-Petit Bourg&lt;/a&gt;. His companion, M\u00e9lin\u00e9e, managed to escape the police.\nManouchian and the others were tortured to gain information, and eventually handed over to the Germans' &lt;a href=\"Geheime%20Feldpolizei\"&gt;Geheime Feldpolizei&lt;/a&gt; (GFP). The 23 were given a 1944 show trial for propaganda purposes before execution. Manouchian and 21 of his comrades were shot at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Mont-Val%C3%A9rien\"&gt;Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; on 21 February 1944. The remaining group member, &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Bancic\"&gt;Olga Bancic&lt;/a&gt;, was deported to Stuttgart and beheaded there in May 1944.\nIn his last letter to his widow, M\u00e9lin\u00e9e, Manouchian said that he forgave everyone except \"the one who betrayed us to save his skin and those who sold us.\" \"There was consensus that they were betrayed by one of their number, Joseph Davidovitch (), who was arrested and tortured by the Nazis (before being released and shot by the Resistance). But some survivors also felt the French Communist Party had sacrificed the unit by refusing to smuggle vital Jewish combatants out of Paris after the French police began to tail them.\"\nIn December 2009, photographs of French Resistance agents facing the firing squad of Nazi officers were discovered. &lt;a href=\"Serge%20Klarsfeld\"&gt;Serge Klarsfeld&lt;/a&gt; identified those killed as Manouchian and his group members. The photographs began being permanently exhibited at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Mont-Val%C3%A9rien\"&gt;Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien&lt;/a&gt; in June 2010.\n\"L'Affaire Manouchian\".\nIn June 1985, a television documentary by Mosco Boucault with the historian &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phane%20Courtois\"&gt;St\u00e9phane Courtois&lt;/a&gt; working as a consultant entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Des%20terroristes%20%C3%A0%20la%20retraite\"&gt;Des terroristes \u00e0 la retraite&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Terrorists in Retirement\") was aired. The documentary started an intense dispute over the identity of the informer who betrayed Manouchian and the rest of \"groupe Manouchian\" in 1943. In the documentary, M\u00e9lin\u00e9e Manouchian accused &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Holban\"&gt;Boris Holban&lt;/a&gt; of being the informer. In the 1986 book \"L'Affaire Manouchian\" by Philippe Robrieux, Holban was accused of being a member of an \"ultra-secret special apparatus\" within the PCF that took its orders from the Kremlin and that Holban had betrayed the \"groupe Manouchian\" on orders from Moscow. The French journalist &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Adler\"&gt;Alexandre Adler&lt;/a&gt;, in a series of articles in the Socialist newspaper \"Le Matin\", defended Holban, arguing that he was not in Paris in the fall of 1943 and thus was not in a position to know the address of Manouchian or anyone else in his group. Adler drew attention to a 1980 article in the Romanian journal \"Magazin istoric\" by the FTP-MOI intelligence chief &lt;a href=\"Cristina%20Luca%20Boico\"&gt;Cristina Luca Boico&lt;/a&gt;, where she mentions that Holban was leading a \"marquis\" band in the Ardennes in November 1943 and had not been in Paris for some time. \"L'Affaire Manouchian\" was finally settled in the 1990s when French police records were opened, revealing that Joseph Davidowicz, a resistance fighter who was arrested and then released by the Gestapo, was the informer who betrayed Manouchian. Davidowicz was later killed by fellow resistance members, who accused him of spying for the Germans.\nRecognition.\nFollowing World War II, Armenians were perceived in France positively \"solely in the reflective light of Missak Manouchian, who played an important role in the French anti-Nazi resistance.\" Manouchian is a prominent figure in the bilateral &lt;a href=\"Armenia%E2%80%93France%20relations\"&gt;relations between Armenia and France&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, an exhibition dedicated to Manouchian was held at the &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9e%20Jean%20Moulin\"&gt;Mus\u00e9e Jean Moulin&lt;/a&gt; in Paris in the scope of the Year of Armenia in France. On 21 February 2014, on the 70th anniversary of the execution of Manouchian and his group, a commemoration ceremony was held at Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien. Notable attendees included French President &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&lt;/a&gt;, Armenian Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Nalbandyan\"&gt;Eduard Nalbandyan&lt;/a&gt; and prominent French-Armenian singer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Aznavour\"&gt;Charles Aznavour&lt;/a&gt;. On 13 March 2014, the Missak Manouchian Park was opened in central &lt;a href=\"Yerevan\"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, the Armenian capital, in attendance of Presidents &lt;a href=\"Serzh%20Sargsyan\"&gt;Serzh Sargsyan&lt;/a&gt; and Hollande.\nOn 5 March 1955, a street named for the Manouchian Group (\"\") was dedicated in the &lt;a href=\"20th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris\"&gt;20th arrondissement of Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1978, a statue of Manouchian sculpted by Ara Harutyunyan was opened in the military cemetery of &lt;a href=\"Ivry-sur-Seine\"&gt;Ivry-sur-Seine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nA commemorative plaque was installed on 22 February 2009 at 11 rue de Plaisance, in the &lt;a href=\"14th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris\"&gt;14th arrondissement of Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The old hotel at this address was the last home shared by Manouchian and his wife, M\u00e9lin\u00e9e.\nIn the 2009 film \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Arm%C3%A9e%20du%20crime\"&gt;L'Arm\u00e9e du crime&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gu%C3%A9diguian\"&gt;Robert Gu\u00e9diguian&lt;/a&gt;, Manouchian appears as the hero, and many parallels are drawn between the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust as the film emphasizes Manouchian's opposition to genocide in the Second World War because he was a survivor of genocide in the First World War. In a review of \"L'Arm\u00e9e du crime\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Monde\"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;\" on 15 November 2009, the French historian &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phane%20Courtois\"&gt;St\u00e9phane Courtois&lt;/a&gt; complained that the film wrongly portrayed Manouchian as an \"anti-Stalinist\" communist and the film was unrealistic in that it had Manouchian casually and routinely violating the rules of clandestine activity. The British historian Gawin Bowd described the film as part of a tendency to move away from the traditional gallocentric view of \"r\u00e9sistancialiste\" where resistance in France was entirely the work of the French. Other examples included the film \"&lt;a href=\"Indig%C3%A8nes\"&gt;Indig\u00e8nes&lt;/a&gt;\" about the role of Muslim soldiers from the Maghreb in the liberation of France and \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Hommes%20libres\"&gt;Les Hommes libres&lt;/a&gt;\" about the role of Muslims in the resistance. However, Bowd noted that the way in which \"L'Arm\u00e9e du crime\" portrays Manouchian as a martyr who \"mort pour la France\" (died for France) does suggest that Manouchian was more of a French hero than an Armenian one as the \"ultimate horizon of Frenchness remains\". \nIn February 2010, busts of Manouchian were inaugurated in a &lt;a href=\"Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, in a square named after him, and in &lt;a href=\"Issy-les-Moulineaux\"&gt;Issy-les-Moulineaux&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to his communist ideology, Manouchian was immediately recognized as a hero in the Soviet Union. Soviet Armenian author &lt;a href=\"Marietta%20Shaginyan\"&gt;Marietta Shaginyan&lt;/a&gt; described him as an \"example of an Armenian who preserved his nationality, and at the same time became a &lt;a href=\"Class%20consciousness\"&gt;class-conscious&lt;/a&gt; worker and a militant communist in his adopted country.\" Russian poet Sergei Shervinsky hailed him in a 1956 \"&lt;a href=\"Ogoniok\"&gt;Ogoniok&lt;/a&gt;\" article as a \"Fighter, Worker, Poet\". A school in &lt;a href=\"Yerevan\"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, Armenia\u2014founded in 1947\u2014was named for Manouchian in 1963."
