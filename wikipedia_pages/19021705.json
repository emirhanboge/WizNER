    "text": "The List of Ottoman postal rates in Palestine surveys the postal rates in effect between 1840\u20131918 during the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29%23Ottoman%20rule%20%281841%E2%80%931917%29\"&gt;Ottoman rule in Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. Rates not applicable in Palestine are not included.\nThe Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 (14 October 1840) and later ordinances made the distinction between three types of mail items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings \"te'ahudd olunmoshdur\"), and official letters (markings \"tahirat-i m\u00fch\u00fcmme\"). Prior to the Imperial Edict, the Ottoman postal service was intermittent for the inland cities in Palestine. Fees were calculated by the type of mail, the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per hour of 1 &lt;a href=\"Para%20%28currency%29\"&gt;para&lt;/a&gt;. Special fees applied to samples, insured mail, special delivery, and printed matters, etc. The postal rates changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Postal%20Union\"&gt;Universal Postal Union&lt;/a&gt; on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.\nPostal rates.\nCurrency:"
