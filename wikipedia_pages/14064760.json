    "text": "The Christian Reformists (\"Cristiano Riformisti\", CR) are a &lt;a href=\"christian%20democracy\"&gt;Christian-democratic&lt;/a&gt; faction within &lt;a href=\"New%20Centre-Right\"&gt;New Centre-Right&lt;/a&gt; (NCD), a &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Italy\"&gt;political party in Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe group emerged as a faction within &lt;a href=\"National%20Alliance%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;National Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (AN), a &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; party. Its founders included &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Mazzochi\"&gt;Antonio Mazzochi&lt;/a&gt; (ex-&lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democracy%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Erder%20Mazzocchi\"&gt;Erder Mazzocchi&lt;/a&gt; (ex-DC) and &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Armani\"&gt;Pietro Armani&lt;/a&gt; (ex-&lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;PRI&lt;/a&gt;). The main goal of CR was the admission of the party into the &lt;a href=\"European%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;European People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (EPP).\nIn March 2009 the CR, along with the whole AN, joined &lt;a href=\"The%20People%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;The People of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; (PdL).\nIn September 2008 the &lt;a href=\"Christian-Social%20European%20Union\"&gt;Christian-Social European Union&lt;/a&gt;, a Christian-democratic association led by &lt;a href=\"Gennaro%20Castiello\"&gt;Gennaro Castiello&lt;/a&gt; (a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Refoundation\"&gt;Christian Democratic Refoundation&lt;/a&gt;) which had joined the PdL in April 2008, merged into the Christian Reformists, opening the way to a 40,000 members-strong \"Catholic bloc\".\nIn 2012, while still being part of the PdL, the faction presented its own lists in a few municipalities in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Italy\"&gt;Central Italy&lt;/a&gt;, gaining a notable 10.5% in &lt;a href=\"Ardea%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Ardea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2013 the CR left the PdL and joined NCD."
