    "text": "Cove Energy plc, also known as Cove, was a &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-headquartered oil &amp; gas exploration company with assets in &lt;a href=\"East%20Africa\"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The company was created in June 2009. In 2012, following significant gas discoveries offshore &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Shell\"&gt;Royal Dutch Shell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PTT%20Exploration%20and%20Production\"&gt;PTT Exploration and Production&lt;/a&gt; (PTTEP), a subsidiary of Thailand's national oil company &lt;a href=\"PTT%20Public%20Company%20Limited\"&gt;PTT Public Company Limited&lt;/a&gt;, engaged in a prominent bidding war to acquire Cove. Ultimately, the company was sold in August 2012 to PTTEP.\nThe early days.\nIn early 2009, Michael Blaha and John Craven, two industry veterans, teamed up to create a new oil &amp; gas explorer with a focus on the largely unexplored deep waters of East Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. They joined the Board of Directors of Lapp Plats plc, a cash-shell listed on the &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20Investment%20Market\"&gt;Alternative Investment Market&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and renamed the company Cove Energy plc.\nMichael Blaha was appointed &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Chairman\"&gt;Executive Chairman&lt;/a&gt; and John Craven became the &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to joining Cove, Michael Blaha was the Country Chairman of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Shell\"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;. John Craven was the founder and former &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Petroceltic%20International\"&gt;Petroceltic International&lt;/a&gt;. Michael Nolan was appointed Financial Director. The management team also consisted of Paul Griggs and Alexander Mollinger. The non-executive directors of Cove included Frank Moxon, Dr Steve Staley and Anthony Golding.\nCove's strategy was to create value for shareholders through acquiring participations in exploration assets and appraisal programmes. The company focussed on young and emerging basins, de-risked through 3D seismic. It also aimed at partnering with proven and reliable operators.\nFunding.\nCove was listed on the &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20Investment%20Market\"&gt;Alternative Investment Market&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Over a period of seventeen months, between June 2009 and November 2010, the company raised a total of \u00a3182 million through four placings. Each placing was done at a significant higher &lt;a href=\"market%20capitalisation\"&gt;market capitalisation&lt;/a&gt; than the previous one:\nThe funds were mostly used to acquire assets and then to keep up with the cost allotment of the fast-paced and expensive drilling campaign offshore &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;. A feature of the Cove business model was that it was sufficiently funded through all stages of its development to support the dynamic and active exploration programmes in all its operations and was also adequately funded to make strategic acquisitions.\nThe Artumas acquisition.\nIn September 2009, Cove acquired several assets from Artumas Group Inc. (now known as Wentworth Resources Limited). These assets, located in &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, consisted of:\nPortfolio of assets.\nCove's portfolio consisted of oil &amp; gas exploration assets in &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. The company was also part of a consortium to bid in two licensing rounds in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Mediterranean\"&gt;Eastern Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;.\nRovuma Offshore Area 1.\nIn September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas an 8.5% interest in Rovuma Offshore Area 1 (also known as Area 1), offshore Northern Mozambique. The block covered 9,562\u00a0km2 (c. 2.4 million acres), located in the deep waters off the coast of Northern &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;. It was operated by &lt;a href=\"Anadarko%20Petroleum\"&gt;Anadarko Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (36.5%), &lt;a href=\"Mitsui\"&gt;Mitsui&lt;/a&gt; (20%), Empresa Nacional de Hydrocarbonetos, E.P. (15%), &lt;a href=\"Bharat%20Petroleum\"&gt;Bharat Petroleum&lt;/a&gt; (10%), &lt;a href=\"Videocon\"&gt;Videocon&lt;/a&gt; (10%) and Cove Energy (8.5%).\nIn late 2009, Cove and its partners started drilling their first exploration well, Windjammer. In February 2010, it discovered the giant \"Prosperidade\" field. In the period from 2010 to 2012, an additional seven exploration wells and five appraisal wells were drilled, and extensive flow testing was conducted and the recoverable resources increased from 5+ &lt;a href=\"Trillion%20Cubic%20Feet\"&gt;Trillion Cubic Feet&lt;/a&gt; (TCF) to 35-65+ TCF of gas.\nProsperidade and the surrounding gas discoveries at Orca, Lagosta, Atum, Golfinho and Tubar\u00e3o are among the world's largest gas discoveries in the last 20 years. Today, the recoverable resources are estimated at 50-70+ TCF of gas. Area 1 is due to start producing gas in 2019 and has the potential to transform &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; into one of the world's largest &lt;a href=\"LNG\"&gt;LNG&lt;/a&gt; exporters, similar to &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and offer long-term benefits to the population.\nRovuma Onshore Block.\nIn September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas a 10% interest in Rovuma Onshore Block, onshore Northern Mozambique. The block covered 13,452\u00a0km2 (c. 3.3 million acres) and was operated by &lt;a href=\"Anadarko%20Petroleum\"&gt;Anadarko Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (35.7%), &lt;a href=\"Maurel%20%26amp%3B%20Prom\"&gt;Maurel &amp; Prom&lt;/a&gt; (27.71%), Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos, E.P. (15%), Wentworth Resources (11.59%) and Cove Energy (10%).\nIn Q1 2012, Cove and its partners shot a c. 1,200\u00a0km 2D seismic survey covering Rovuma Onshore Block. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in two prospects being identified, which were believed to be gas prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled.\n&lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;.\nMnazi Bay.\nIn September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas a 16.38% interest in the production and 20.475% interest in the exploration of the Mnazi Bay concession, partly offshore and partly onshore Southern Tanzania. The concession covered c. 760\u00a0km2 (c. 0.2 million acres) and was operated by &lt;a href=\"Maurel%20%26amp%3B%20Prom\"&gt;Maurel &amp; Prom&lt;/a&gt;. For the production, the partnership consisted of Maurel &amp; Prom (38.22%), Wentworth Resources (25.4%), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (20%) and Cove Energy (16.38%). For the exploration, the partnership consisted of Maurel &amp; Prom (47.775%), Wentworth Resources (31.75%) and Cove Energy (20.475%).\nIn July 2012, Cove sold its interests in the Mnazi Bay concession to Maurel &amp; Prom and Wentworth Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12.\nIn July 2010, Cove acquired from &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-based Dynamic Global Advisers (DGA) a 15% interest in blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12, offshore &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. The blocks covered 30,632\u00a0km2 (c. 7.6 million acres) and were operated by &lt;a href=\"Anadarko%20Petroleum\"&gt;Anadarko Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Q3 2011, the blocks were farmed down by &lt;a href=\"Anadarko%20Petroleum\"&gt;Anadarko Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;, DGA and Cove to &lt;a href=\"Total%20SA\"&gt;Total&lt;/a&gt;, which left Cove with a 10% interest and substantial carry on further 3D seismic acquisition and drilling. Consequently, DGA sold its remaining interest to Total. The partnership then consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (50%), Total (40%) and Cove Energy (10%).\nIn Q3-Q4 2011, Cove and its partners shot a c. 3,000\u00a0km2 3D seismic survey covering blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in a number of large prospects being identified, which were believed to be oil-prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled.\nBlocks L10A-L10B.\nIn early 2011, Cove formed a consortium with &lt;a href=\"BG%20Group\"&gt;BG Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Oil\"&gt;Premier Oil&lt;/a&gt; and Pan Continental Oil &amp; Gas to participate in the upcoming bidding round in &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. Following two successful bid applications, Cove signed Production Sharing Contracts for blocks L10A and L10B, located in deep waters in the Southern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Lamu\"&gt;Lamu&lt;/a&gt; basin and adjacent to, and inboard of, blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12. The blocks covered 10,516\u00a0km2 (c. 2.6 million acres) and were operated by &lt;a href=\"BG%20Group%20plc\"&gt;BG Group&lt;/a&gt;. For block L10A, the partnership consisted of BG Group (40%), Premier Oil (20%), Pan Continental Oil &amp; Gas (15%) and Cove Energy (25%). For block L10B, the partnership consisted of BG Group (45%), Premier Oil (25%), Pan Continental Oil &amp; Gas NL (15%) and Cove Energy (15%).\nIn Q4 2011, Cove and its partners shot a c. 2,000\u00a0km2 3D seismic survey covering blocks L10A and L10B. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in a number of large prospects being identified, which were believed to be oil prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled.\n&lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2010, Cove formed a consortium with &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Energy\"&gt;Cairn Energy&lt;/a&gt; and CC Energy Development SAL, an affiliate company of &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20Contractors%20Company\"&gt;Consolidated Contractors Company&lt;/a&gt;, to participate in the upcoming licensing rounds in &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. When Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012, the licensing rounds had not taken place yet and thus Cove withdrew from the consortium.\nThe sale process.\nNotwithstanding its strong financial position, Cove put itself up for sale in December 2011. Given \"Prosperidade\"\u2019s size and its close distance to the gas-hungry Asian markets, the sale attracted a long list of high-calibre suitors, including major independents and national oil companies.\nBetween February and July 2012, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Shell\"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; and PTTEP engaged in a prominent bidding war to acquire Cove. On 21 February 2012, Shell placed an indicative bid of \u00a31.95 per share. Two days later, Cove received an indicative bid of \u00a32.20 per share from PTTEP. On 3 May 2012, Shell made a recommended cash offer of \u00a32.20 per share, followed on 23 May 2012 by a recommended cash offer of \u00a32.40 per share from PTTEP. In July 2012, Shell retracted its offer and announced it was withdrawing from the bidding process. In August 2012, Cove was sold to PTTEP for \u00a31.2 billion (\u00a32.40 per share). It was one of 2012's most prominent public takeovers worldwide.\nPost-Cove.\nIn November 2012, the former management team of Cove Energy (in its entirety) founded a new oil &amp; gas exploration company, Discover Exploration Limited (also known as Discover). The management team consists of former-Cove executives Michael Blaha, John Craven, Michael Nolan, Alexander Mollinger and Paul Griggs. Similar to Cove, Discover's strategy is to deliver value to shareholders through participation in exploration and appraisal programmes focussing on deep-water petroleum systems. Discover has exploration assets in the &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe initial funding of Discover came in November 2012 from ONH B.V., and Discover's management team and Board of Directors. ONH B.V. is the holding company of Oranje-Nassau Energie B.V., the largest privately owned Dutch exploration and production operating company.\nIn December 2013, &lt;a href=\"The%20Carlyle%20Group\"&gt;The Carlyle Group&lt;/a&gt; announced that it was backing the management team of Discover Exploration by investing up to US$200 million in the company.\nIn November 2014, &lt;a href=\"McKinsey%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;McKinsey &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; published \"A new approach to oil and gas exploration\", an article on the management team of Cove Energy and Discover Exploration."
