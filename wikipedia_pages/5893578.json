    "text": "Alfred Steward (born 18 September 1896 in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;) was an English &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager. He also played cricket for &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;'s second eleven, though he did not appear in &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteward, a &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, played football in the army between 1915 and 1918, before joining &lt;a href=\"Stalybridge%20Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Stalybridge Celtic&lt;/a&gt;. In 1919 he joined &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; as an amateur, as cover for United first choice keeper &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Mew\"&gt;Jack Mew&lt;/a&gt;. While an amateur he also played for &lt;a href=\"Heaton%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Heaton Park&lt;/a&gt; before turning professional with United in January 1920. His United debut came in October that year, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 win at home to &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt;. He finally became a regular in the United side in the 1923\u201324 season, and was an ever-present the following season as United won promotion, as runners-up, to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;. Between April 1924 and September 1927 Steward missed only 7 league games out of a possible 139 for United, before losing his place to &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Robinson\"&gt;Lance Robinson&lt;/a&gt;. He regained his first team place in April 1928 and went on to play a further 149 games before leaving Old Trafford in June 1932, joining &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester North End&lt;/a&gt; as player-manager.\nHe led North End to the final of the Cheshire County League Cup against &lt;a href=\"Altrincham%20F.C.\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 1932\u201333 season, a final in which he managed to play for both sides. The final finished in a 3\u20133 draw, but the replay was held over until the following season, by which time Steward had joined &lt;a href=\"Altrincham%20F.C.\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt; as player-manager. Altrincham won the replay 4\u20131, and later that season made the 1st Round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, losing to &lt;a href=\"Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.\"&gt;Gainsborough Trinity&lt;/a&gt;. They also won the Cheshire Senior Cup.\nHe finally retired as a player during the 1937\u201338 season, making just two appearances that season. In May 1938 he took over as secretary-manager at &lt;a href=\"Third%20Division%20%28South%29\"&gt;Division Three (South)&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt;. Torquay finished 19th in his only full season with the club, &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; intervening. He remained at Torquay until the club closed for the war in May 1940."
