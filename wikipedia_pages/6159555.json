    "text": "The Jersey Football Association (JFA) is the body which co-ordinates &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. The Jersey FA acts as a &lt;a href=\"County%20football%20association\"&gt;County football association&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;The Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, although in 2015 it applied to join &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; as a full member. The &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20Football%20Combination\"&gt;Jersey Football Combination&lt;/a&gt; is overseen by the Jersey FA, as is the &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20official%20football%20team\"&gt;Jersey official football team&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Jersey Football Association was founded in 1905 and affiliated itself with The Football Association based in England. This became a practice that the other British &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Dependencies\"&gt;Crown Dependencies&lt;/a&gt; would follow. Though The FA treat Jersey like a county football board, the JFA run their own league system independent from the English football pyramid. During the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20the%20Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Occupation of the Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the JFA was not permitted to function by the Nazis and their pitches were confiscated. At the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20German-occupied%20Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Liberation&lt;/a&gt;, the JFA organised a celebratory match between local Jerseymen and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nUEFA application.\nIn 2015, the JFA applied for membership in &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; which would allow them to play against other international teams, independent of England. They opted to choose this route versus creating a club side for the English leagues, as neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Guernsey\"&gt;Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; had done with &lt;a href=\"Guernsey%20F.C.\"&gt;Guernsey F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. They based their application on the success of the &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Gibraltar Football Association&lt;/a&gt; in the latter's application for &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; to join UEFA. However, UEFA changed its rules following Gibraltar joining to state that membership would only be granted to independent countries. UEFA rejected JFA's application without presenting it to their congress on those grounds.\nThe JFA took the case against UEFA to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled in their favour that UEFA must give the JFA the chance to apply. Though Jersey was initially hopeful, the FA, which Jersey had viewed as a key body, declined to support them. Jersey lost the vote in congress with 49 out of 55 against, &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; abstaining and five not registering a vote. Despite losing the vote, the UEFA president &lt;a href=\"Aleksander%20Ceferin\"&gt;Aleksander Ceferin&lt;/a&gt; said he would be prepared to look into assisting Jersey.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath, Jersey player James Scott applied for a Jersey team independent of the JFA to join &lt;a href=\"ConIFA\"&gt;ConIFA&lt;/a&gt;. The application was accepted for the &lt;a href=\"Parishes%20of%20Jersey%20football%20team\"&gt;Parishes of Jersey football team&lt;/a&gt; to play in ConIFA matches. Also as a result, &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20Bulls%20F.C.\"&gt;Jersey Bulls&lt;/a&gt; were founded to enter the English football pyramid and were affiliated to the JFA. In 2019, the JFA merged with the &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20Football%20Combination\"&gt;Jersey Football Combination&lt;/a&gt;, with the JFA taking over the running of league football in Jersey."
