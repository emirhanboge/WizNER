It was released in July 4, 2011 by &lt;a href=\"Archer%20Records\"&gt;Archer Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction.\n\"Stranger Me\" was recorded and mixed at Music + Arts Studio in &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and at The Garden Studio in London, England, with producer Craig Silvey.\nCritical reception.\n\"Stranger Me\" was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. At &lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an &lt;a href=\"weighted%20arithmetic%20mean\"&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; score of 78 based on 9 reviews. At &lt;a href=\"AnyDecentMusic%3F\"&gt;AnyDecentMusic?&lt;/a&gt;, the release was given a 7.2 out of 10 based on a critical consensus of 7 reviews.\nIn a review for &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt;, critic reviewer Hal Horowitz wrote \"\"Stranger Me\" is not only a logical title but a demanding and surprisingly successful experiment that challenges both LaVere and the listener, pushing her into edgy, clearly non-commercial areas.\" Steve Pick of \"&lt;a href=\"Blurt%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Blurt&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote \"LaVere's vocals are deceptively lightweight. Her voice is high and thin, but she phrases eloquently and conveys a wide range of emotional conviction throughout all her work.\" At \"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\", Stephen Deusner said LaVere's release is a \"well-rounded album.\"\nPersonnel.\nMusicians\nProduction"
