    "text": "The Epistle to the Romans or Letter to the Romans, often shortened to Romans, is the sixth book in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt;. Biblical scholars agree that it was composed by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Paul the Apostle&lt;/a&gt; to explain that &lt;a href=\"Salvation%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;salvation&lt;/a&gt; is offered through &lt;a href=\"the%20gospel\"&gt;the gospel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20in%20Christianity\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;. It is the longest of the &lt;a href=\"Pauline%20epistles\"&gt;Pauline epistles&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral presentation.\nIn the opinion of &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Fitzmyer\"&gt;Joseph Fitzmyer&lt;/a&gt;, the book \"overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of the justification and salvation of Jew and Greek alike by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, revealing the uprightness and love of &lt;a href=\"God%20the%20Father\"&gt;God the Father&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"N.%20T.%20Wright\"&gt;N. T. Wright&lt;/a&gt; notes that Romans is\nAuthorship and dating.\nThe scholarly consensus is that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Romans. &lt;a href=\"C.%20E.%20B.%20Cranfield\"&gt;C. E. B. Cranfield&lt;/a&gt;, in the introduction to his commentary on Romans, says:\nThe denial of Paul's authorship of Romans by such critics ... is now rightly relegated to a place among the curiosities of NT scholarship. Today no responsible criticism disputes its Pauline origin. The evidence of its use in the Apostolic Fathers is clear, and before the end of the second century it is listed and cited as Paul's. Every extant early list of NT books includes it among his letters. The external evidence of authenticity could indeed hardly be stronger; and it is altogether borne out by the internal evidence, linguistic, stylistic, literary, historical and theological.\nThe letter was most probably written while Paul was in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt;, probably while he was staying in the house of &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20%28biblical%20figure%29\"&gt;Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, and transcribed by &lt;a href=\"Tertius%20of%20Iconium\"&gt;Tertius&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"amanuensis\"&gt;amanuensis&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of reasons why Corinth is considered most plausible. Paul was about to travel to &lt;a href=\"Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; on writing the letter, which matches Acts where it is reported that Paul stayed for three months in &lt;a href=\"Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. This probably implies Corinth as it was the location of Paul's greatest missionary success in Greece. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Phoebe%20%28Christian%20woman%29\"&gt;Phoebe&lt;/a&gt; was a deacon of the church in &lt;a href=\"Kechries\"&gt;Cenchreae&lt;/a&gt;, a port to the east of Corinth, and would have been able to convey the letter to &lt;a href=\"Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; after passing through Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth's west port. &lt;a href=\"Erastus%20of%20Corinth\"&gt;Erastus&lt;/a&gt;, mentioned in , also lived in Corinth, being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in Corinth.\nThe precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the collection for Jerusalem had been assembled and Paul was about to \"go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints\", that is, at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city. The majority of scholars writing on Romans propose the letter was written in late 55/early 56 or late 56/early 57. Early 55 and early 58 both have some support, while German New Testament scholar &lt;a href=\"Gerd%20L%C3%BCdemann\"&gt;Gerd L\u00fcdemann&lt;/a&gt; argues for a date as early as 51/52 (or 54/55), following on from Knox, who proposed 53/54. L\u00fcdemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s.\nTextual variants.\nFourteen-chapter form.\nThere is strong, albeit indirect, evidence that a &lt;a href=\"recension\"&gt;recension&lt;/a&gt; of Romans that lacked Chapters 15 and 16 was widely used in the western half of the Roman Empire until the mid-4th century. This conclusion is partially based on the fact that a variety of &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Origen\"&gt;Origen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tertullian\"&gt;Tertullian&lt;/a&gt;, refer to a fourteen-chapter edition of Romans, either directly or indirectly. The fact that Paul's &lt;a href=\"doxology\"&gt;doxology&lt;/a&gt; is placed in various different places in different &lt;a href=\"manuscript\"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt;s of Romans only strengthens the case for an early fourteen-chapter recension. While there is some uncertainty, Harry Gamble concludes that the canonical sixteen-chapter recension is likely the earlier version of the text.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Codex%20Boernerianus\"&gt;Codex Boernerianus&lt;/a&gt; lacks the explicit references to the Roman church as the audience of the epistle found in Romans 1:7 and 1:15. There is evidence from &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;patristic&lt;/a&gt; commentaries indicating that Boernarianus is not unique in this regard; many early, no longer extant manuscripts also lacked an explicit Roman addressee in Chapter 1. It is notable that, when this textual variant is combined with the omission of Chapters 15 and 16, there is no longer any clear reference to the Roman church throughout the entire epistle. Harry Gamble speculates that 1:7, 1:15, and Chapters 15 and 16 may have been removed by a scribe in order to make the epistle more suitable for a \"general\" audience.\nFifteen-chapter form.\nIt is quite possible that a fifteen-chapter form of Romans, omitting Chapter 16, may have existed at an early date. Several scholars have argued, largely on the basis of internal evidence, that Chapter 16 represents a separate letter of Paul\u2014 possibly addressed to &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 that was later appended to Romans.\nThere are a few different arguments for this conclusion. First of all, there is a concluding peace benediction at 15:33, which reads like the other Pauline benedictions that conclude their respective letters. Secondly, Paul greets a large number of people and families in Chapter 16, in a way that suggests he was already familiar with them, whereas the material of Chapters 1-15 presupposes that Paul has never met anyone from the Roman church. The fact that &lt;a href=\"Papyrus%2046\"&gt;Papyrus 46&lt;/a&gt; places Paul's doxology at the end of Chapter 15 can also be interpreted as evidence for the existence of a fifteen-chapter recension of the epistle.\nSubscript.\nSome manuscripts have a subscript at the end of the Epistle:\nPaul's life in relation to his epistle.\nFor ten years before writing the letter (approx. 47\u201357), Paul had traveled around the territories bordering the &lt;a href=\"Aegean%20Sea\"&gt;Aegean Sea&lt;/a&gt; evangelizing. Churches had been planted in the Roman provinces of &lt;a href=\"Galatia\"&gt;Galatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Achaea%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Achaia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Paul, considering his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in &lt;a href=\"Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Seville\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, where he would not \"build upon another man\u2019s foundation\". This allowed him to visit Rome on the way, a long-time ambition of his. The letter to the Romans, in part, prepares them and gives reasons for his visit.\nIn addition to Paul's geographic location, his religious views are important. First, Paul was a &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20Jew\"&gt;Hellenistic Jew&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Pharisaic\"&gt;Pharisaic&lt;/a&gt; background (see &lt;a href=\"Gamaliel\"&gt;Gamaliel&lt;/a&gt;), integral to his identity: see &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle%20and%20Judaism\"&gt;Paul the Apostle and Judaism&lt;/a&gt; for details. His concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter. Second, the other side of the dialogue is &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Damascus\"&gt;Paul's conversion&lt;/a&gt; and calling to follow Christ in the early 30s.\nThe churches in Rome.\nThe most probable ancient account of the beginning of Christianity in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; is given by a 4th-century writer known as &lt;a href=\"Ambrosiaster\"&gt;Ambrosiaster&lt;/a&gt;:\nFrom Adam Clarke:\nAt this time, the &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s made up a substantial number in Rome, and their &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt;s, frequented by many, enabled the &lt;a href=\"Gentile\"&gt;Gentile&lt;/a&gt;s to become acquainted with the story of &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, churches composed of both Jews and Gentiles were formed at Rome. According to &lt;a href=\"Irenaeus\"&gt;Irenaeus&lt;/a&gt;, a 2nd-century &lt;a href=\"Church%20Father\"&gt;Church Father&lt;/a&gt;, the church at Rome was founded directly by the apostles &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;. However, many modern scholars disagree with Irenaeus, holding that while little is known of the circumstances of the church's founding, it was not founded by Paul:\nNote the large number of names in of those then in Rome, and verses 5, 15 and 16 indicate there was more than one church assembly or company of believers in Rome. Verse 5 mentions a church that met in the house of &lt;a href=\"Aquila%20and%20Priscilla\"&gt;Aquila and Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;. Verses 14 and 15 each mention groupings of believers and saints.\nJews were expelled from Rome because of disturbances around AD 49 by the &lt;a href=\"edict\"&gt;edict&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt;. Fitzmyer claims that both Jews and Jewish Christians were expelled as a result of their infighting. &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt; died around the year AD 54, and his successor, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Nero\"&gt;Emperor Nero&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the Jews back into Rome, but then, after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fire%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Great Fire of Rome&lt;/a&gt; of 64, Christians were persecuted. Fitzmyer argues that with the return of the Jews to Rome in 54 new conflict arose between the Gentile Christians and the Jewish Christians who had formerly been expelled. Keck thinks Gentile Christians may have developed a dislike of or looked down on Jews (see also &lt;a href=\"Antisemitism\"&gt;Antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Responsibility%20for%20the%20death%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Responsibility for the death of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;), because they &lt;a href=\"Supersessionism\"&gt;theologically rationalized&lt;/a&gt; that Jews were no longer God's people.\nStyle.\nScholars often have difficulty assessing whether Romans is a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20%28message%29\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"epistle\"&gt;epistle&lt;/a&gt;, a relevant distinction in &lt;a href=\"Form%20criticism\"&gt;form-critical&lt;/a&gt; analysis:\nA letter is something non-literary, a means of communication between persons who are separated from each other. Confidential and personal in nature, it is intended only for the person or persons to whom it is addressed, and not at all for the public or any kind of publicity...An Epistle is an artistic literary form, just like the dialogue, the oration, or the drama. It has nothing in common with the letter except its form: apart from that one might venture the paradox that the epistle is the opposite of a real letter. The contents of the epistle are intended for publicity\u2014they aim at interesting \"the public.\"\nJoseph Fitzmyer argues, from evidence put forth by Stirewalt, that the style of Romans is an \"essay-letter.\" &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Melanchthon\"&gt;Philip Melanchthon&lt;/a&gt;, a writer during the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that Romans was \"caput et summa universae doctrinae christianae\" (\"a summary of all Christian doctrine\"). While some scholars suggest, like Melanchthon, that it is a type of theological treatise, this view largely ignores chapters 14 and 15 of Romans. There are also many \"noteworthy elements\" missing from Romans that are included in other areas of the Pauline corpus. The breakdown of Romans as a treatise began with &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Baur\"&gt;F.C. Baur&lt;/a&gt; in 1836 when he suggested \"this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical circumstances in which Paul wrote it.\"\nPaul sometimes uses a style of writing common in his time called a \"diatribe\". He appears to be responding to a \"heckler\" (probably an imaginary one based on Paul's encounters with real objections in his previous preaching), and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. In the flow of the letter, Paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the Jewish members of the church, sometimes the Gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole.\nPurposes of writing.\nTo review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of Romans, along with a bibliography, see \"Dictionary of Paul and His Letters\". For a 16th-century \"Lollard\" reformer view, see the work of &lt;a href=\"William%20Tyndale\"&gt;William Tyndale&lt;/a&gt;. In his prologue to his translation of the book of Romans, which was largely taken from the prologue of German Reformer &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;, Tyndale writes that:\n... this epistle is the principal and most excellent part of the new testament, and most pure evangelion, that is to say glad tidings and what we call the gospel, and also a light and a way in unto the whole scripture ... The sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle, is, to prove that a man is justified by faith only: which proposition whoso denieth, to him is not only this epistle and all that Paul writeth, but also the whole scripture, so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health. And to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth, Paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt, yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking, that it is impossible for her to keep the law in the sight of God.\nContents.\nThis essay-letter composed by Paul was written to a specific audience at a specific time; to understand it, the situations of both Paul and the recipients must be understood.\nPrologue (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:1\u201315&lt;/a&gt;).\nGreeting (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:1\u20137&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe introduction provides some general notes about Paul. He introduces &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;his apostleship&lt;/a&gt; here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to the church at Rome. Jesus' human line stems from &lt;a href=\"David\"&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;. Paul, however, does not limit his ministry to Jews. Paul's goal is that the &lt;a href=\"Gentiles\"&gt;Gentiles&lt;/a&gt; would also hear the &lt;a href=\"gospel\"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrayer of Thanksgiving (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:8\u201315&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe commends the Romans for &lt;a href=\"faith\"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt;. Paul also speaks of the past obstacles that have blocked his coming to Rome earlier.\nSalvation in the Christ (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%208\"&gt;\u20138:39&lt;/a&gt;).\nRighteousness of God (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:16\u201317&lt;/a&gt;).\nPaul's announcement that he is not \"ashamed\" (\"epaisc\u00fanomai\") of his gospel because it holds power (\"d\u00fanamis\"). These two verses form a backdrop for the rest of the book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is speaking to the \"Jew first.\" There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle%20and%20Judaism\"&gt;Paul the Apostle and Judaism&lt;/a&gt; is still debated. We are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the &lt;a href=\"Judaizers\"&gt;Judaizers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Epistle%20to%20the%20Galatians\"&gt;Galatians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCorinthians\"&gt;2\u00a0Corinthians&lt;/a&gt;, that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also &lt;a href=\"Antinomianism%23Antinomianism%20in%20the%20New%20Testament\"&gt;Antinomianism in the New Testament&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supersessionism\"&gt;Supersessionism&lt;/a&gt;). Paul may have used the \"Jew first\" approach to counter such a view.\nCondemnation: The Universal corruption of Gentiles and Jews (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%203\"&gt;\u20133:20&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe judgment of God (&lt;a href=\"Romans%201\"&gt;1:18\u201332&lt;/a&gt;).\nPaul begins with a summary of Hellenistic Jewish apologist discourse. His summary begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there already is &lt;a href=\"Divine%20retribution\"&gt;wrath from God&lt;/a&gt;. People have taken God's invisible image and made him into an &lt;a href=\"Idolatry%20and%20Christianity\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt;. Paul draws heavily here from the &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%20of%20Solomon\"&gt;Wisdom of Solomon&lt;/a&gt;. This summary condemns &lt;a href=\"Non-traditional%20sexual%20relationships\"&gt;\"unnatural sexual behavior\"&lt;/a&gt; and warns that such behavior has already resulted in a depraved body and mind (\"reprobate mind\" in the King James Version) and says that people who do such things (including murder and wickedness ) are worthy of death. Paul stands firmly against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20cult%20%28ancient%20Rome%29\"&gt;idol worship system which was common in Rome&lt;/a&gt;. Several scholars believe the passage is a non-Pauline &lt;a href=\"Interpolation%20%28manuscripts%29\"&gt;interpolation&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaul's warning of hypocrites (&lt;a href=\"Romans%202\"&gt;2:1\u20134&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn the traditional &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; interpretation, Paul here calls out Jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they themselves are also not following the law. Stanley Stowers, however, has argued on rhetorical grounds that Paul is in these verses not addressing a Jew at all but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person (\u1f41 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd). Stowers writes, \"There is absolutely no justification for reading as Paul's attack on 'the hypocrisy of the Jew.' No one in the &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20the%201st%20century\"&gt;first century&lt;/a&gt; would have identified \"ho alazon\" with Judaism. That popular interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later Christian characterizations of Jews as 'hypocritical &lt;a href=\"Pharisees\"&gt;Pharisees&lt;/a&gt;'\". See also &lt;a href=\"Anti-Judaism\"&gt;Anti-Judaism&lt;/a&gt;.\nJustification: The Gift of Grace and Forgiveness through Faith (&lt;a href=\"Romans%203\"&gt;3:21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%205\"&gt;\u20135:11&lt;/a&gt;).\nPaul says that a righteousness from God has made itself known apart from the law, to which the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neviim\"&gt;prophets&lt;/a&gt; testify, and this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe. He describes &lt;a href=\"Justification%20%28theology%29\"&gt;justification&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin \u2013 as a gift of God, and not the work of man (lest he might boast), but by faith.\nAssurance of salvation (&lt;a href=\"Romans%205\"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%2011\"&gt;\u201311&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn chapters five through eight, Paul argues that believers can be &lt;a href=\"Assurance%20%28theology%29\"&gt;assured&lt;/a&gt; of their &lt;a href=\"hope\"&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"salvation\"&gt;salvation&lt;/a&gt;, having been freed from the bondage of sin. Paul teaches that through &lt;a href=\"faith\"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt;, the faithful have been joined with &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and freed from sin. Believers should celebrate in the assurance of salvation and be certain that no external force or party can take their salvation away from them. This promise is open to everyone since everyone has sinned, save the one who paid for all of them.\nIn , Paul says that humans are under the law while we live: \"Know ye not...that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\" However, Jesus' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law (, \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the &lt;a href=\"body%20of%20Christ\"&gt;body of Christ&lt;/a&gt;\"), according to &lt;a href=\"Antinomianism%23Pauline%20passages%20supporting%20antinomianism\"&gt;an antinomistic interpretation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Paul addresses the faithfulness of &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Israelites\"&gt;Israelites&lt;/a&gt;, where he says that God has been faithful to his promise. Paul hopes that all Israelites will come to realize the truth, stating that \"Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In &lt;a href=\"Isaac\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt; shall thy seed be called.\" Paul affirms that he himself is also an Israelite, and had in the past been a persecutor of &lt;a href=\"Early%20Christians\"&gt;Early Christians&lt;/a&gt;. In Paul talks about how the nation of Israel has not been cast away, and the conditions under which Israel will be God's chosen nation again: when Israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief.\nTransformation of believers (&lt;a href=\"Romans%2012\"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%2015\"&gt;\u201315:13&lt;/a&gt;).\nFrom chapter 12 through the first part of chapter 15, Paul outlines how the &lt;a href=\"Gospel\"&gt;Gospel&lt;/a&gt; transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. This transformation is described as a \"renewing of your mind\" (12:2), a transformation that &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20J.%20Moo\"&gt;Douglas J. Moo&lt;/a&gt; characterizes as \u201cthe heart of the matter.\u201d It is a transformation so radical that it amounts to \u201ca transfiguration of your brain,\u201d a \"&lt;a href=\"Metanoia%20%28theology%29\"&gt;metanoia&lt;/a&gt;\", a \u201cmental revolution.\u201d\nPaul goes on to describe how believers should live. Christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of Moses, but under the grace of God, see &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20grace\"&gt;Law and grace&lt;/a&gt;. We do not need to live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed, we will know \"almost instinctively\" what God wants of us. The law then provides an \"objective standard\" for judging progress in the \"lifelong process\" of our mind's renewal.\nTo the extent they have been set free from &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt; by renewed minds (Romans 6:18), believers are no longer bound to sin. Believers are free to live in obedience to God and love everybody. As Paul says in Romans 13:10, \"love (\u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7) worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law\".\nObedience to earthly powers (&lt;a href=\"Romans%2013\"&gt;13:1\u20137&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe fragment in Romans 13:1\u20137 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example &lt;a href=\"James%20Kallas\"&gt;James Kallas&lt;/a&gt;, to be an &lt;a href=\"Interpolation%20%28manuscripts%29\"&gt;interpolation&lt;/a&gt;. (See also the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Commandment\"&gt;Great Commandment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20and%20politics\"&gt;Christianity and politics&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Tillich\"&gt;Paul Tillich&lt;/a&gt; accepts the historical authenticity of Romans 13:1\u20137, but claims it has been misinterpreted by churches with an anti-revolutionary bias:\nOne of the many politico-theological abuses of biblical statements is the understanding of Paul\u2019s words [Romans 13:1\u20137] as justifying the anti-revolutionary bias of some churches, particularly the Lutheran. But neither these words nor any other New Testament statement deals with the methods of gaining political power. In Romans, Paul is addressing eschatological enthusiasts, not a revolutionary political movement.\nEpilogue (&lt;a href=\"Romans%2015\"&gt;15:1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Romans%2016\"&gt;\u201316:23&lt;/a&gt;).\nPaul's ministry and travel plans (&lt;a href=\"Romans%2016\"&gt;16:14\u201327&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe concluding verses contain a description of his travel plans, personal greetings and salutations. One-third of the twenty-one Christians identified in the greetings are &lt;a href=\"Paul%20the%20Apostle%20and%20women\"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, none of these Christians answer to the name &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, although according to the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic tradition&lt;/a&gt;, he had been ruling as &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; in Rome for about 25 years. Possibly related was the &lt;a href=\"Incident%20at%20Antioch\"&gt;Incident at Antioch&lt;/a&gt; between Paul and Cephas.\nHermeneutics.\nCatholic interpretation.\nRoman Catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to for the necessity of living a &lt;a href=\"Good%20works\"&gt;virtuous life&lt;/a&gt; as well:\nBut by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality.\nCatholics would also look to the passage in Romans 8:13 for evidence that justification by faith is only valid so long as it is combined with obedient cooperation with The Holy Spirit, and the passage in Romans 11:22 to show that the Christian can lose their justification if they turn away from cooperating with The Holy Spirit and reject Christ through mortal sin.\nProtestant interpretation.\nIn the Protestant interpretation, the New Testament epistles (including Romans), describes salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions. For example, Romans (underlining added):\nThey also point out that in Romans , Paul says that God will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that \"no one\" follows the law perfectly (see also &lt;a href=\"Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount%23Interpretations\"&gt;Sermon on the Mount: Interpretation&lt;/a&gt;) Romans :\nRomans has been at the forefront of several major movements in Protestantism. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther's&lt;/a&gt; lectures on Romans in 1515\u20131516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; which led to the \"&lt;a href=\"95%20Theses\"&gt;95 Theses&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1517. In the preface to his &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Bible\"&gt;German translation&lt;/a&gt; of Romans, Luther described Paul's letter to the Romans as \"the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian's while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul\". In 1738, while hearing Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans read at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Botolph\"&gt;St. Botolph&lt;/a&gt; Church on &lt;a href=\"Aldersgate%20Street\"&gt;Aldersgate Street&lt;/a&gt; in London, &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley\"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/a&gt; famously felt his heart \"strangely warmed\", a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Methodism\"&gt;Methodism&lt;/a&gt;.\nLuther controversially added the word \"alone\" (\"allein\" in German) to Romans so that it read: \"thus, we hold, then, that man is justified without doing the works of the law, \"alone\" through faith\". The word \"alone\" does not appear in the original Greek &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20manuscript\"&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;, but Luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb \"alone\" was required both by idiomatic German and Paul's intended meaning. This is a \"literalist view\" rather than a &lt;a href=\"Literal%20translation\"&gt;literal view&lt;/a&gt; of the Bible.\nApologist James Swan lists numerous Catholic sources that also translated &lt;a href=\"Romans%203%23Verse%2028\"&gt;Romans 3:28&lt;/a&gt; with the word \"alone,\" or testified to others doing so before Luther. A Bible commentary published in 1864 reports that:\nThe \"Romans Road\" (or \"Roman Road\") refers to a set of scriptures from Romans that Christian evangelists use to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation to each person, as all the verses are contained in one single book, making it easier for evangelism without going back and forth through the entire New Testament. The core verses used by nearly all groups using \"Romans Road\" are: Romans , , , , and .\nExternal links.\n\"Translations\"\n\"Other\""
