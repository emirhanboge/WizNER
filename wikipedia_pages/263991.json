It is one of the seven provincial capitals of the region. It is the largest city &lt;a href=\"Comune\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in the region and the second largest in northeast Italy. The &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; of Verona covers an area of and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants. It is one of the main tourist destinations in northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs and shows as well as the &lt;a href=\"Opera\"&gt;opera season&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Verona%20Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amphitheater\"&gt;amphitheater&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween the 13th and 14th century the city was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Della%20Scala%20Family\"&gt;Della Scala Family&lt;/a&gt;. Under the rule of the family, in particular of &lt;a href=\"Cangrande%20I%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Cangrande I della Scala&lt;/a&gt;, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming rich and powerful and being surrounded by new walls. The Della Scala era is survived in numerous monuments around Verona.\nTwo of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s plays are set in Verona: \"&lt;a href=\"Romeo%20and%20Juliet\"&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;\" (which also features Romeo's visit to &lt;a href=\"Mantua\"&gt;Mantua&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Two%20Gentlemen%20of%20Verona\"&gt;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&lt;/a&gt;\". It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. Verona was also the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Isotta%20Nogarola\"&gt;Isotta Nogarola&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to be the first major female &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;humanist&lt;/a&gt; and one of the most important humanists of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"November\"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; the city was declared a &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; because of its urban structure and architecture.\nHistory.\nThe precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery along with the origin of the name. One theory is it was a city of the &lt;a href=\"Euganei\"&gt;Euganei&lt;/a&gt;, who were obliged to give it up to the &lt;a href=\"Cenomani%20%28Cisalpine%20Gaul%29\"&gt;Cenomani&lt;/a&gt; (550 BCE). With the conquest of the Valley of the &lt;a href=\"Po%20%28river%29\"&gt;Po&lt;/a&gt;, the Veronese territory became Roman (about 300 BCE). Verona became a Roman \"&lt;a href=\"Colonia%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;colonia&lt;/a&gt;\" in 89 BCE. It was classified as a \"&lt;a href=\"municipium\"&gt;municipium&lt;/a&gt;\" in 49 BCE, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe \"Poblilia\" or \"Publicia\".\nThe city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. &lt;a href=\"Stilicho\"&gt;Stilicho&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Alaric%20I\"&gt;Alaric&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Visigoths\"&gt;Visigoths&lt;/a&gt; here in 403. But, after Verona was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Ostrogoths\"&gt;Ostrogoths&lt;/a&gt; in 489, the &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; domination of Italy began. &lt;a href=\"Theoderic%20the%20Great\"&gt;Theoderic the Great&lt;/a&gt; was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29\"&gt;Gothic War (535\u2013552)&lt;/a&gt;, except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer &lt;a href=\"Artabazes%20%28military%20officer%29\"&gt;Artabazes&lt;/a&gt; made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 &lt;a href=\"Valerian%20%28general%29\"&gt;Valerian&lt;/a&gt; vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.\nIn 569, it was taken by &lt;a href=\"Alboin\"&gt;Alboin&lt;/a&gt;, King of the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt;, in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was killed by his wife in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. &lt;a href=\"Adalgis\"&gt;Adalgis&lt;/a&gt;us, son of &lt;a href=\"Desiderius\"&gt;Desiderius&lt;/a&gt;, in 774 made his last desperate resistance in Verona to &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona became the ordinary residence of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Italy\"&gt;kings of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count &lt;a href=\"Milo%20of%20Verona\"&gt;Milo&lt;/a&gt;, progenitor of the counts of &lt;a href=\"San%20Bonifacio\"&gt;San Bonifacio&lt;/a&gt;. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there. &lt;a href=\"Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Otto I&lt;/a&gt; ceded to Verona the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Verona\"&gt;marquisate&lt;/a&gt; dependent on the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Bavaria\"&gt;Duchy of Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with &lt;a href=\"Vicenza\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Padua\"&gt;Padua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Treviso\"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"Veronese%20League\"&gt;Veronese League&lt;/a&gt;, which was integrated with the &lt;a href=\"Lombard%20League\"&gt;Lombard League&lt;/a&gt; in 1167 to battle against &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20I%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Frederick I Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt;. Victory was achieved at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Legnano\"&gt;Battle of Legnano&lt;/a&gt; in 1176, and the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Treaty of Venice&lt;/a&gt; signed in 1177 followed by the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Constance\"&gt;Peace of Constance&lt;/a&gt; in 1183.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ezzelino%20III%20da%20Romano\"&gt;Ezzelino III da Romano&lt;/a&gt; was elected \"podest\u00e0\" in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podest\u00e0, and he converted the \"signoria\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podest\u00e0 in 1262, he affected a coup d'\u00e9tat, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podest\u00e0. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.\nThe reign of his son Alberto as capitano (1277\u20131302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and &lt;a href=\"Cangrande%20I%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Cangrande I&lt;/a&gt;, only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;Dante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petrarch\"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Giotto\"&gt;Giotto&lt;/a&gt;. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of &lt;a href=\"Padua\"&gt;Padua&lt;/a&gt; (1328), &lt;a href=\"Treviso\"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt; (1308) and &lt;a href=\"Vicenza\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt;. At this time before the &lt;a href=\"Black%20death\"&gt;Black death&lt;/a&gt; the city was home to more than 40,000 people.\nCangrande was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Mastino%20II%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Mastino II&lt;/a&gt; (1329\u20131351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering &lt;a href=\"Brescia\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt; in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po. He purchased &lt;a href=\"Parma\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; (1335) and &lt;a href=\"Lucca\"&gt;Lucca&lt;/a&gt; (1339). After the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;King of France&lt;/a&gt;, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was formed against him in 1337 \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Visconti%20of%20Milan\"&gt;Visconti&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Este\"&gt;Este&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Gonzaga\"&gt;Gonzaga&lt;/a&gt;. After a three years war, the &lt;a href=\"Scaliger\"&gt;Scaliger&lt;/a&gt; dominions were reduced to Verona and &lt;a href=\"Vicenza\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt; (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to &lt;a href=\"Bernab%C3%B2%20Visconti\"&gt;Barnab\u00f2 Visconti&lt;/a&gt;). Mastino's son &lt;a href=\"Cangrande%20II%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Cangrande II&lt;/a&gt; (1351\u20131359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359\u20131375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375\u201387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Galeazzo%20Visconti\"&gt;Gian Galeazzo Visconti&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October 1387), thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.\nThe year 1387 is also the year of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Castagnaro\"&gt;Battle of Castagnaro&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ordelaffi\"&gt;Giovanni Ordelaffi&lt;/a&gt;, for Verona, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Hawkwood\"&gt;John Hawkwood&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"Padua\"&gt;Padua&lt;/a&gt;, who was the winner.\nAntonio's son &lt;a href=\"Canfrancesco%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Canfrancesco&lt;/a&gt; attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the &lt;a href=\"Carraresi\"&gt;Carraresi&lt;/a&gt;, he drove out the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;ese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20of%20Verona%20to%20Venice\"&gt;submitted to Venice&lt;/a&gt; (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.\nFrom 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor Maximilian I&lt;/a&gt;. There were numerous outbreaks of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20plague%20of%201629%E2%80%931631\"&gt;1629\u201333&lt;/a&gt; Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60 per cent of the population at the time) in 1630\u20131631.\nIn 1776 was developed a method of bellringing called &lt;a href=\"Veronese%20bellringing%20art\"&gt;Veronese bellringing art&lt;/a&gt;. Verona was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; in 1797, but on &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Monday\"&gt;Easter Monday&lt;/a&gt; the populace &lt;a href=\"Veronese%20Easter\"&gt;rose and drove out&lt;/a&gt; the French. It was then that Napoleon made an &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Venetian Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Verona became &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian territory&lt;/a&gt; when Napoleon signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio\"&gt;Treaty of Campo Formio&lt;/a&gt; in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29\"&gt;Treaty of Pressburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia\"&gt;Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Verona\"&gt;Congress of Verona&lt;/a&gt;, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the , opening with the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in 1814\u201315, that marked the continuing enforcement of the \"&lt;a href=\"Concert%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Concert of Europe&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1866, following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Third Italian War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of United Italy.\nThe advent of &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the &lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20of%20Race\"&gt;Manifesto of Race&lt;/a&gt;, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 1943, deportations to &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;Nazi concentration camps&lt;/a&gt;. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied troops&lt;/a&gt;, Jews and &lt;a href=\"Anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascists&lt;/a&gt;, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Social%20Republic\"&gt;Italian Social Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs in Austrian times, Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. &lt;a href=\"Galeazzo%20Ciano\"&gt;Galeazzo Ciano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;'s son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a &lt;a href=\"show%20trial\"&gt;show trial&lt;/a&gt; staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at &lt;a href=\"Castelvecchio%20Museum\"&gt;Castelvecchio&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Verona%20trial\"&gt;Verona trial&lt;/a&gt;), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945. \nAfter World War II, as Italy joined the &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nVerona has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cold, humid winters, even though &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Garda\"&gt;Lake Garda&lt;/a&gt; has a partial influence on the city. The &lt;a href=\"relative%20humidity\"&gt;relative humidity&lt;/a&gt; is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.\nDemographics.\nIn 2009, 265,368 people were residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, &lt;a href=\"Veneto\"&gt;Veneto&lt;/a&gt;, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0\u201317) totaled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who number 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Verona residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Verona grew by 3.05%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current &lt;a href=\"birth%20rate\"&gt;birth rate&lt;/a&gt; of Verona is 9.24 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\n, 87% of the population was &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;. The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest coming from &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;): 3.60%, &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;: 2.03%, and &lt;a href=\"Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;sub-saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; 1.50%. The city is predominantly &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, but due to immigration now has some &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; followers.\nGovernment.\nSince the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in \"&lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Barbieri\"&gt;Palazzo Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;\". Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the Mayor of Verona every five years.\nVerona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in \"Palazzo del Governo\". The current Mayor of Verona is &lt;a href=\"Federico%20Sboarina\"&gt;Federico Sboarina&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia%20%282013%29\"&gt;FI&lt;/a&gt;), elected on 26 June 2017.\nThis is a list of the mayors of Verona since 1946:\nMain sights.\nBecause of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Verona%20Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the &lt;a href=\"earthquake%20of%203%20January%201117\"&gt;earthquake of 3 January 1117&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a massive &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; rebuilding. The &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Carolingian period&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Versus%20de%20Verona\"&gt;Versus de Verona&lt;/a&gt;\" contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.\nRoman edifices.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Roman%20legion\"&gt;Roman military&lt;/a&gt; settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the &lt;a href=\"Cardo\"&gt;cardines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decumanus%20Maximus\"&gt;decumani&lt;/a&gt; that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6\u00a0m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors. \n&lt;a href=\"Piazza%20delle%20Erbe%2C%20Verona\"&gt;Piazza delle Erbe&lt;/a&gt;, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by &lt;a href=\"Cangrande%20I%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Cangrande I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cansignorio%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Cansignorio della Scala I&lt;/a&gt;, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.\nVerona is famous for its &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amphitheater\"&gt;amphitheater&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Verona%20Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, found in the city's largest piazza, the &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20Bra\"&gt;Piazza Bra&lt;/a&gt;. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome's &lt;a href=\"Colosseum\"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt; and the arena at &lt;a href=\"Capua\"&gt;Capua&lt;/a&gt;. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The \"&lt;a href=\"ludi\"&gt;ludi&lt;/a&gt;\" (shows and &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story &lt;a href=\"Facade\"&gt;fa\u00e7ade&lt;/a&gt; is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Valpolicella\"&gt;Valpolicella&lt;/a&gt;, with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; during warm summer nights.\nThere is also a variety of other &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Roman%20architecture\"&gt;Roman monuments&lt;/a&gt; to be found in the town, such as the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20theatre%20of%20Verona\"&gt;Roman theatre of Verona&lt;/a&gt;. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the &lt;a href=\"Ponte%20Pietra%20%28Verona%29\"&gt;Ponte di Pietra&lt;/a&gt; (\"Stone Wall Bridge\"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Arco%20dei%20Gavi\"&gt;Arco dei Gavi&lt;/a&gt;\" (Gavi Arch) was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Vitruvius%20Cordo\"&gt;Lucius Vitruvius Cordo&lt;/a&gt;ne) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main &lt;a href=\"Roman%20roads\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt; into the city, now the Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.\nNearby is the \"&lt;a href=\"Porta%20Borsari\"&gt;Porta Borsari&lt;/a&gt;\", an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the fa\u00e7ade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20wall\"&gt;city walls&lt;/a&gt;. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as \"Colonia Verona Augusta\". Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original &lt;a href=\"Via%20Sacra\"&gt;Via Sacra&lt;/a&gt; of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Palazzo\"&gt;palazzi&lt;/a&gt; and the ancient &lt;a href=\"Santi%20Apostoli%2C%20Verona\"&gt;Church of Santi Apostoli&lt;/a&gt;, a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Porta%20Leoni\"&gt;Porta Leoni&lt;/a&gt;\" is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman &lt;a href=\"city%20gate\"&gt;city gate&lt;/a&gt;. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20site\"&gt;archaeological site&lt;/a&gt;, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Santo%20Stefano%2C%20Verona\"&gt;Santo Stefano&lt;/a&gt;\" church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the &lt;a href=\"Paleochristian\"&gt;Paleochristian&lt;/a&gt; era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Stephen\"&gt;Saint Stephen&lt;/a&gt; underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian &lt;a href=\"martyr\"&gt;martyr&lt;/a&gt; and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Porta%20Leoni\"&gt;Porta Leoni&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMedieval architecture.\nWith a span length of , the segmental &lt;a href=\"arch%20bridge\"&gt;arch bridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Castelvecchio%20Bridge\"&gt;Ponte Scaligero&lt;/a&gt; featured, at the time of its completion in 1356, the world's largest bridge arch.\nNotable people.\nVerona was the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Catullus\"&gt;Catullus&lt;/a&gt;, and the town that &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt; chose for relaxing stays. It has had an association with many important people and events that have been significant in the history of Europe, such as &lt;a href=\"Theoderic%20the%20Great\"&gt;Theoderic the Great&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href=\"Ostrogoths\"&gt;Ostrogoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alboin\"&gt;Alboin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29\"&gt;Rosamund&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombard&lt;/a&gt; Dukes, &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pepin%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Pippin of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berengar%20I%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Berengar I&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;Dante&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Papal%20conclave\"&gt;Conclaves&lt;/a&gt; were held here, as were important congresses. Verona featured in the travel diaries of &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendhal\"&gt;Stendhal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Val%C3%A9ry\"&gt;Paul Val\u00e9ry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michel%20de%20Montaigne\"&gt;Michel de Montaigne&lt;/a&gt;. The British writer &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Parks\"&gt;Tim Parks&lt;/a&gt; has been living near Verona since the 1980s and the city is central to many of his books, notably &lt;a href=\"A%20Season%20with%20Verona\"&gt;A Season with Verona&lt;/a&gt; and Italian Neighbors.\nSport.\nThe city has two professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; teams nowadays.
