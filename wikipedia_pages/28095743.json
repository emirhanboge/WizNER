    "text": "Giropay is an &lt;a href=\"E-commerce%20payment%20system\"&gt;Internet payment&lt;/a&gt; System in Germany, based on &lt;a href=\"online%20banking\"&gt;online banking&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced in February 2006, this payment method allows customers to buy securely on the Internet using direct online transfers from their bank account. The system is similar to the Dutch &lt;a href=\"iDEAL\"&gt;iDEAL&lt;/a&gt; payment system, &lt;a href=\"MyBank\"&gt;MyBank&lt;/a&gt; payment system, the &lt;a href=\"Interac\"&gt;Interac&lt;/a&gt; Online service in Canada, pagomiscuentas payment service in Argentina, and Secure Vault payments in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Giropay is owned by giropay &lt;a href=\"GmbH\"&gt;GmbH&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransaction volume.\nBy May 2007, more than 100 million euro in purchases had been made.\nIn 2008, the system processed 3.2 million transfers, with the transactions made totalling 185 million Euros.\nOver one million such transactions are processed every month.\nScope.\nMost German \"&lt;a href=\"German%20public%20bank\"&gt;Sparkassen&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"cooperative%20bank\"&gt;cooperative bank&lt;/a&gt;s are participating in Giropay. However, the number of participating banks from the &lt;a href=\"private%20sector\"&gt;private sector&lt;/a&gt; is limited. In this sector, the only major participating bank is &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Postbank\"&gt;Deutsche Postbank&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Giropay has a reach of about 17 million German online banking customers, and about 60% of all commercial bank accounts. That number means the participating banks are serving the vast majority of the German online banking market.\nProcess.\nGiropay offers merchants a real-time payment method (publicized as virtually risk-free) to accept internet payments. For customers, Giropay uses the same environment as their banks' online banking sites. The level of security depends on the participating bank. Some German Banks offer &lt;a href=\"two-factor%20authentication\"&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; (2FA), such as a &lt;a href=\"challenge-response\"&gt;challenge-response&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"access%20token\"&gt;access token&lt;/a&gt; based on the chip embedded in the &lt;a href=\"debit%20card\"&gt;debit card&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20teller%20machine\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; card. Others, however, offer simpler &lt;a href=\"Personal%20identification%20number\"&gt;PIN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transaction%20authentication%20number\"&gt;TAN&lt;/a&gt; based online banking services. No sensitive information is being shared with the merchant, such as &lt;a href=\"credit%20card\"&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Giro\"&gt;Giro&lt;/a&gt; account numbers. There is no &lt;a href=\"chargeback\"&gt;chargeback&lt;/a&gt; right however, which can be considered a disadvantage for the consumer using this payment method. This is considered an advantage to the merchants.\nGiropay works as follows:\nPayments are guaranteed for amounts up to 5000 euros.\nCosts.\nCosts are calculated on a per transaction basis and decrease with transaction volume or value. The NetBanx payment gateway quotes figures from 1.2% to 0.9%, plus 0.08 \u20ac per transaction."
