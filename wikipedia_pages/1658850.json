    "text": "K Street is a 2003 &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"television%20series\"&gt;television series&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"lobbying\"&gt;lobbyists&lt;/a&gt; and politicians in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; It was named for a &lt;a href=\"K%20Street%20%28Washington%2C%20DC%29\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; that is home to many lobbying and legal firms.\nFormat.\nEach episode was largely &lt;a href=\"improvisation\"&gt;improvised&lt;/a&gt;, usually focused around the major political news of the week. This required that the show be shot within days of its airdate in order to keep the episodes fresh.\n\"K Street\" featured a fictional, bipartisan consulting firm led by husband and wife duo &lt;a href=\"James%20Carville\"&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Matalin\"&gt;Mary Matalin&lt;/a&gt; as themselves, as well as three fictional characters. The show featured &lt;a href=\"cameo%20role\"&gt;cameos&lt;/a&gt; from numerous real-life &lt;a href=\"political%20figure\"&gt;political figure&lt;/a&gt;s, some of whom were aware of the fictional plot, with others seemingly unaware. The show made a notable impact on the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20nomination%2C%202004\"&gt;2004 Democratic Primary&lt;/a&gt; when Carville gave &lt;a href=\"Vermont\"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; Governor and presidential hopeful &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Dean\"&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/a&gt; a line to use in a debate. Local appearances by the show's producer, &lt;a href=\"George%20Clooney\"&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt; (director &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Soderbergh\"&gt;Steven Soderbergh&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the project), caused considerable stir with frequent mentions in the \"Style\" section of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe show was quite popular in the Washington, D.C. area but failed to find a broader audience. On November 24, 2003, HBO declined to renew it after the initial 10 episodes.\nReception.\nIn her review for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", Alessandra Stanley wrote, \"Much has been written about the growing resemblance between &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; and Washington. As seen from \"K Street\", Foggy Bottom is just another &lt;a href=\"La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pit\"&gt;La Brea Tar Pit&lt;/a&gt;, where dinosaurs from past campaigns continually surface to be restored and preserved\". In his review for the \"&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Post\"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\", Tom Shales wrote, \"\"K Street\" is highly unlikely to become a national sensation, but in big cities of the East it ought to be quite the conversation piece\u2014for a little while anyway. In a sense, the show comes off like a marvelous party, but one to which many of us are bound to feel profoundly uninvited\". \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's Phil Gallo wrote, \"Director Steven Soderbergh uses a guerilla style of filmmaking to capture behind-the-scenes players with a fervent urgency; if \"K Street\" holds its course, it could serve as a primer in understanding modern-day politics\". In his review for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Daily%20News\"&gt;The New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;\", David Bianculli wrote, \"Its starkness\u2014no music, no opening credits and no identification of the show's real and imagined players until the end\u2014is a stylistic choice, but an unsatisfying one\". In his review for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Post\"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;\", Adam Buckman wrote, \"I didn't quite believe my eyes when I watched \"K Street\", but like a UFO, I'm eager for a second look\". \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the show one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"sitting through \"K Street\" was like watching a group of show-off kids hanging around amusing each other when they should be working. You'd think these people would have better things to do with their time, particularly the ones who are drawing a salary from the public treasury. Taxpayers and HBO subscribers should demand better for their money\"."
