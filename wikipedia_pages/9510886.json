    "text": "The Bank of Guatemala () is the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;. It was established in 1945.\nIt is one of the most recognized &lt;a href=\"Brutalist%20architecture\"&gt;Brutalist&lt;/a&gt; themed architectural structures. Designed by architects Jos\u00e9 Montes C\u00f3rdova and Ra\u00fal Minondo, the iconic bank stands within the heart of the city's civic center. In collaboration with Guatemalan artists Dagoberto V\u00e1squez Casta\u00f1eda and &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20Goyri\"&gt;Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Goyri&lt;/a&gt;, the design highlights its Mayan heritage through the decorative East and West facing fa\u00e7ades. Standing at 40 meters high, the concrete structure, in its materiality, reflects the Brutalist movement and its emphasis on a utilitarian design approach, but also slightly combats the movement due to the unique details of its fa\u00e7ade. The beautiful design expresses an ornate subtlety which pays homage to the artistic importance Guatemalan culture has had on its urban landscape.\nGovernance.\nSergio Francisco Recinos Rivera has been President of the bank since October 2018.\nFormer Presidents of the Bank of Guatemala.\nSource: Bank of Guatemala"
