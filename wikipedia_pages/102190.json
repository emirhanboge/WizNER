Hughes was the first Canadian woman to win a medal in road cycling at the Olympics, winning two in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\nAs a result of her success in multiple sports and her &lt;a href=\"humanitarian\"&gt;humanitarian&lt;/a&gt; efforts, Hughes was named to both the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;Order of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; and as an &lt;a href=\"Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Officer of the Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

She was inspired to begin skating after witnessing &lt;a href=\"Ga%C3%A9tan%20Boucher\"&gt;Ga\u00e9tan Boucher&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1988 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.
