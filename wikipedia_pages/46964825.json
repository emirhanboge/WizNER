    "text": "Wil\u0121a Battery (), also known as Saint James Battery () or Zondodari Battery (), is a former &lt;a href=\"artillery%20battery\"&gt;artillery battery&lt;/a&gt; in Delimara, &lt;a href=\"Marsaxlokk\"&gt;Marsaxlokk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;. It was built in 1714 by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Hospitaller\"&gt;Order of Saint John&lt;/a&gt; as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. Today, the battery's gun platform is largely destroyed, but its blockhouse remains intact and has been restored.\nHistory.\nWil\u0121a Battery was built in 1714 as part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included six other batteries, the large &lt;a href=\"Fort%20San%20Lucian\"&gt;St. Lucian Tower&lt;/a&gt;, two smaller &lt;a href=\"De%20Redin%20towers\"&gt;De Redin towers&lt;/a&gt;, four redoubts and three entrenchments. It is located on the Delimara peninsula, roughly opposite St. Lucian Tower, and between &lt;a href=\"Del%20Fango%20Redoubt\"&gt;Del Fango Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delimara%20Tower\"&gt;Delimara Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe battery originally consisted of a large pentagonal gun platform, which lacked a parapet, with an L-shaped blockhouse on one side of the platform.\nOver time, the roof of the blockhouse collapsed, leaving the structure in ruins. Most of the gun platform was demolished in 1994 to make way for the new road to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Delimara%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Delimara Power Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe collapsed blockhouse of the battery was rebuilt. It was leased by the Lands Department to a private owner in 2004, and it is currently used for private functions."
