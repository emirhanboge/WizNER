    "text": "Amygdaloideae is a subfamily within the &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; family &lt;a href=\"Rosaceae\"&gt;Rosaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It was formerly considered by some authors to be separate from Rosaceae, and the family names Prunaceae and Amygdalaceae have been used. Reanalysis from 2007 has shown that the previous definition of subfamily Spiraeoideae was &lt;a href=\"paraphyletic\"&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/a&gt;. To solve this problem, a larger subfamily was defined that includes the former Amygdaloideae, &lt;a href=\"Spiraeoideae\"&gt;Spiraeoideae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maloideae\"&gt;Maloideae&lt;/a&gt;. This subfamily, however, is to be called Amygdaloideae rather than Spiraeoideae under the &lt;a href=\"International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants\"&gt;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&lt;/a&gt; as updated in 2011.\nAs traditionally defined, the Amygdaloideae includes such commercially important crops as &lt;a href=\"plum\"&gt;plum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cherry\"&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apricot\"&gt;apricot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peach\"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"almond\"&gt;almond&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; of these plants are known as stone fruit (&lt;a href=\"drupe\"&gt;drupe&lt;/a&gt;s), as each fruit contains a hard shell (the &lt;a href=\"endocarp\"&gt;endocarp&lt;/a&gt;) called a \"stone\" or \"pit\", which contains the single seed.\nThe expanded definition of the Amygdaloideae adds to these commercially important crops such as &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pear\"&gt;pear&lt;/a&gt;s that have &lt;a href=\"pome\"&gt;pome&lt;/a&gt; fruit, and also important ornamental plants such as \"&lt;a href=\"Spiraea\"&gt;Spiraea&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Aruncus\"&gt;Aruncus&lt;/a&gt;\" that have hard dry fruits.\nTaxonomic history.\nThe name Prunoideae is sometimes used, but is incorrect. The 1835 publication of that name by &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Thomas%20Burnett\"&gt;Gilbert Thomas Burnett&lt;/a&gt; (Burnett) is invalid because it lacks a description (or diagnosis or reference to an earlier description or diagnosis). &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Fedorowitsch%20Horaninow\"&gt;Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow&lt;/a&gt; (Horan.) published the name in 1847, but Amygdaloideae, published in 1832 by &lt;a href=\"George%20Arnott%20Walker-Arnott\"&gt;George Arnott Walker-Arnott&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=\"Correct%20name%20%28botany%29\"&gt;priority&lt;/a&gt; and is therefore the correct name.\nThe taxonomy of this group of plants within the Rosaceae has recently been unclear. In 2001 it was reported that Amygdaloideae \"&lt;a href=\"sensu%20stricto\"&gt;sensu stricto&lt;/a&gt;\" consists of two distinct genetic groups or \"&lt;a href=\"clades\"&gt;clades&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Prunus\"&gt;Prunus&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2013\"&lt;a href=\"Maddenia\"&gt;Maddenia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Exochorda\"&gt;Exochorda&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2013\"&lt;a href=\"Oemleria\"&gt;Oemleria&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2013\"&lt;a href=\"Prinsepia\"&gt;Prinsepia&lt;/a&gt;\". Further refinement shows that \"Exochorda\"\u2013\"Oemleria\"\u2013\"Prinsepia\" is somewhat separate from \"Prunus\"\u2013\"Maddenia\"\u2013\"Pygeum\", and that the traditional subfamilies &lt;a href=\"Maloideae\"&gt;Maloideae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spiraeoideae\"&gt;Spiraeoideae&lt;/a&gt; must be included in Amygdaloideae if a &lt;a href=\"paraphyly\"&gt;paraphyletic group&lt;/a&gt; is to be avoided. With this classification, the genus \"Prunus\" is considered to include \"Armeniaca\", \"Cerasus\", \"Amygdalus\", \"Padus\", \"Laurocerasus\", \"Pygeum\", and \"Maddenia\".\n&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Frost\"&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/a&gt; alluded to the merging of Amygdalaceae into Rosaceae in his poem \"The Rose Family\", when he wrote \"The rose is a rose and was always a rose / But the theory now goes that the apple's a rose, / and the pear is, and \"so's the plum, I suppose\".\" In the next line he wrote, \"The dear [i.e., \"the dear Lord\", euphemized] only knows what will next prove a rose.\" This referred to shifting botanical opinion which had recently reunited Amygdalaceae, Spiraeaceae, and Malaceae into Rosaceae (which matches de Jussieu's 1789 classification).\nClassification.\nA recent classification places the following genera in the subfamily:"
