He has played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) for the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pirates selected McCutchen in the first round (11th pick overall) of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;2005 MLB draft&lt;/a&gt;, and he made his MLB debut in 2009. During McCutchen's tenure in Pittsburgh, he was the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; (NL) &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a five-time &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All Star&lt;/a&gt; (2011\u201315), a four-time &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Slugger%20Award\"&gt;Silver Slugger Award&lt;/a&gt; winner (2012\u201315), a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Glove%20Award\"&gt;Gold Glove Award&lt;/a&gt; winner in 2012, and the &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente%20Award\"&gt;Roberto Clemente Award&lt;/a&gt; winner in 2015. McCutchen led the NL in &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; (194) in 2012, and in &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; (.410), &lt;a href=\"On-base%20plus%20slugging\"&gt;OPS&lt;/a&gt; (.952), and &lt;a href=\"extra%20base%20hit\"&gt;extra base hit&lt;/a&gt;s (69) in 2014.\nEarly years.\nMcCutchen was born in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Meade%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Fort Meade, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, to Lorenzo McCutchen and Petrina Swan, who were high school teenagers at the time. He has a sister, Loren. He lived with his mother while his father attended &lt;a href=\"Carson%E2%80%93Newman%20University\"&gt;Carson\u2013Newman University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20City%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Jefferson City, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where Lorenzo played &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team. Lorenzo gave up his dream of making the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) to be close to his son, and returned to Fort Meade in 1989. Petrina would not marry him unless he became a church minister, which he did. The two married on August 1, 1992.\nMcCutchen was eligible to play &lt;a href=\"varsity%20team\"&gt;varsity&lt;/a&gt; baseball as an eighth grader at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Meade%20High%20School\"&gt;Fort Meade High School&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batted&lt;/a&gt; .591 that year. McCutchen's average his senior season was .709, as he hit 16 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s and 42 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; (RBI). During his varsity career, McCutchen batted .474.\nMcCutchen also ran &lt;a href=\"Track%20and%20field\"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; and played football.

McCutchen was one of the top football recruits in the state of Florida, with his high school position being &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt;, but opted for a career in baseball. He was reportedly offered a full-ride scholarship to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Miami\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt; to play football.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nMcCutchen, who had committed to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Florida\"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;, was drafted 11th overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;2005 MLB draft&lt;/a&gt;. He opted to sign with the Pirates, receiving a $1.9\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt;, instead of attending Florida. In 2005 he played for the Rookie &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Gulf Coast League&lt;/a&gt; (GCL) &lt;a href=\"GCL%20Pirates\"&gt;Pirates&lt;/a&gt; and the Class A- &lt;a href=\"Williamsport%20Crosscutters\"&gt;Williamsport Crosscutters&lt;/a&gt;, and hit a combined .310/.419 (2nd in the GCL)/.433 with 2 home runs and 17 stolen bases in 210 at bats, as he was second in the league with 29 walks, tied for second with 36 runs, third with 3 triples, and fifth with 13 stolen bases.\nBefore the 2006 season \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America\"&gt;Baseball America&lt;/a&gt;\" named McCutchen the #50 prospect in the minor leagues. McCutchen played the majority of the season for the Class A &lt;a href=\"Hickory%20Crawdads\"&gt;Hickory Crawdads&lt;/a&gt;, for whom he started the &lt;a href=\"South%20Atlantic%20League\"&gt;South Atlantic League&lt;/a&gt; (SAL) All-Star team in his first full season as a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional player&lt;/a&gt; and was a postseason SAL All Star. He also played for the Class AA &lt;a href=\"Altoona%20Curve\"&gt;Altoona Curve&lt;/a&gt;, and batted a combined .294/.359/.450 with 17 home runs and 23 stolen bases in 531 at bats. At the end of that year, the Pirates named him the organization's Minor League Player of the Year.\nBefore the 2007 season \"Baseball America\" named McCutchen the #13 prospect in the minor leagues, and \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Prospectus\"&gt;Baseball Prospectus&lt;/a&gt;\" named him the #15 prospect. He played again for Altoona, as well as for the Class AAA &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Indians\"&gt;Indianapolis Indians&lt;/a&gt;, and hit a combined 265/.329/.388 with 11 home runs and 21 stolen bases in 513 at bats. In 2007 he also played for the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Desert%20Dogs\"&gt;Phoenix Desert Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, he was on the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Fall%20League\"&gt;Arizona Fall League&lt;/a&gt; All-Prospect Team and named a Rising Star.\nBefore the 2008 season \"Baseball America\" named him the #14 prospect in the minor leagues, and \"Baseball Prospectus\" named him the #24 prospect.

He again played for Indianapolis, but played only 49 games for them, as he batted .303/.361/.493 with 4 home runs and 17 stolen bases in 201 at bats.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\n2009.\nOn June 3, 2009, after the Pittsburgh Pirates traded starting center fielder &lt;a href=\"Nate%20McLouth\"&gt;Nate McLouth&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;, McCutchen was called up to the MLB for the first time. He made his MLB debut the next day, playing center field and batting &lt;a href=\"Leadoff%20hitter\"&gt;leadoff&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;singled&lt;/a&gt; in his first career &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;, off starter &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Pelfrey\"&gt;Mike Pelfrey&lt;/a&gt;. McCutchen ended the day with two singles, one RBI, three &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; scored, and a &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stolen base&lt;/a&gt; in four at bats. He recorded his first career four-hit game five days later, against McLouth and the Braves. Two of his hits were &lt;a href=\"Triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triples&lt;/a&gt;, making him the first Pirate with two triples in a game since &lt;a href=\"Tike%20Redman\"&gt;Tike Redman&lt;/a&gt; accomplished the feat in 2003.\nOn June 17, McCutchen hit his first MLB career home run off of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Liriano\"&gt;Francisco Liriano&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;. On June 25, he had his first MLB career walk-off hit, off &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; closer &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Herges\"&gt;Matt Herges&lt;/a&gt;. \"He's an impressive looking young player. He really is\", said Indians manager &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Wedge\"&gt;Eric Wedge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 1, against the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;, McCutchen went 4-for-5, with three home runs and six RBI. He hit a solo home run in the first inning to lead off the game against Nationals starter &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Stammen\"&gt;Craig Stammen&lt;/a&gt;, a two-run shot in the fourth inning off reliever &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Clippard\"&gt;Tyler Clippard&lt;/a&gt;, and then a three-run homer in the sixth off &lt;a href=\"Logan%20Kensing\"&gt;Logan Kensing&lt;/a&gt;. He fell a &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; short of a (natural) home run cycle. He became the 10th Pirates player ever to hit three home runs in a single game, and the first one to do it during his rookie year. Ten days later against the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Coors%20Field\"&gt;Coors Field&lt;/a&gt;, he stole a career-high three bases in a game off three different Rockies pitchers. McCutchen hit his first walk-off home run on August 25, off &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Lidge\"&gt;Brad Lidge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcCutchen finished his rookie season batting .286/.365/.471, with 9 triples (6th in the National League), an 81.48 &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base%20percentage\"&gt;stolen base percentage&lt;/a&gt; (6th), 12 home runs, 54 RBI, and 22 stolen bases in 108 games. On defense, he had 10 &lt;a href=\"Assist%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;assists&lt;/a&gt; (3rd among NL center fielders), and a 2.53 &lt;a href=\"range%20factor\"&gt;range factor&lt;/a&gt;/game (4th).\nMcCutchen finished fourth in the voting for the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;National League Rookie of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;, behind &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Coghlan\"&gt;Chris Coghlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20A.%20Happ\"&gt;J. A. Happ&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Hanson\"&gt;Tommy Hanson&lt;/a&gt;. He was named the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Baseball America Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt; for 2009.\n2010.\nMcCutchen began the 2010 season as the Pirates' every day center fielder. \"He's an All-Star. This year, probably\", said Atlanta Braves manager &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Cox\"&gt;Bobby Cox&lt;/a&gt;. \"Hitting. Running. Defense. Throwing. He's got it all. He catches the ball like &lt;a href=\"Andruw%20Jones\"&gt;Andruw Jones&lt;/a&gt; did when he was 19. You can't hit a ball [past him] out there. He's got lightning in that bat too.\"\nMcCutchen posted a career day against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; on May 14, going 5-for-5 with five runs scored in a 10\u20137 Pirates win. Teammate &lt;a href=\"Garrett%20Jones\"&gt;Garrett Jones&lt;/a&gt; also recorded five hits, making McCutchen and Jones the first Pirate duo since &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; inductee &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Stargell\"&gt;Willie Stargell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Robertson\"&gt;Bob Robertson&lt;/a&gt; accomplished the feat in 1970. \"I guess we were just kind of competing against each other\", McCutchen said, laughing. \"I don't know. I'd get a hit, he'd get a hit. He'd hit a homer, I'd hit a homer.\" McCutchen finished the month of May with career-best numbers, hitting .327 with a .901 &lt;a href=\"On-base%20plus%20slugging\"&gt;OPS&lt;/a&gt;, which drew comparisons with &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Rays\"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Crawford\"&gt;Carl Crawford&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcCutchen was not named to the 2010 National League All Star Team. Pirates pitcher &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Meek\"&gt;Evan Meek&lt;/a&gt;, who was named the Pirates representative, said that McCutchen was \"very deserving\" and should have gone as well.\nAfter hitting .226 in August, McCutchen batted .326, with 22 runs and 17 RBIs, in September. He also recorded 12 multi-hit games from September 3 \u2013 October 3. McCutchen said about the changes from August to September, \"Honestly, I don't think I'm doing anything any different right now. You swing, and the ball finds a hole. That's it. That's the game of baseball.\"\nMcCutchen finished his second major league season hitting .286/.365/.449 while adding 94 runs, 16 home runs, 56 RBIs, and 33 stolen bases (5th in the National League), with a 21.6 &lt;a href=\"power-speed%20number\"&gt;power-speed number&lt;/a&gt; (9th). On defense, he had 8 assists (3rd of all NL center fielders) and 2 &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;s from center field (5th).\n2011.\nMcCutchen took the place of the injured &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Braun\"&gt;Ryan Braun&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the National League &lt;a href=\"All%20Star\"&gt;All Star&lt;/a&gt; team at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix. On August 30, 2011, McCutchen hit a ninth inning homer against the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; to become the eighth Pirates player to record at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases in one season. He was the first Pirate to accomplish the feat since &lt;a href=\"Nate%20McLouth\"&gt;Nate McLouth&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nMcCutchen finished the season batting .259/.364/.456 with team highs of 23 home runs, 23 stolen bases, 87 runs, and 89 RBIs. He also had a 23.0 power-speed number (4th in the National League) and 89 &lt;a href=\"walk\"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;s (5th). On defense, he led all NL outfielders in &lt;a href=\"putout\"&gt;putout&lt;/a&gt;s (414), double plays (5), and range factor/game (2.73). He was nominated as the Pirates' representative for the &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Aaron%20Award\"&gt;Hank Aaron Award&lt;/a&gt;.\n2012.\nOn March 5, 2012, McCutchen signed a six-year, $51.5\u00a0million contract extension with the Pirates, with a $14.75\u00a0million club option for 2018. He was a &lt;a href=\"2012%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2012 NL All Star&lt;/a&gt;. McCutchen was chosen to replace &lt;a href=\"Giancarlo%20Stanton\"&gt;Giancarlo Stanton&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Run%20Derby\"&gt;Home Run Derby&lt;/a&gt; due to injury. He hit 4 home runs during the first round of the competition, and failed to reach the second round.\nMcCutchen was named &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Player%20of%20the%20Month%20Award\"&gt;NL Player of the Month&lt;/a&gt; for June, his first selection. He won his first &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Player%20of%20the%20Week%20Award\"&gt;NL Player of the Week Award&lt;/a&gt; on July 8, and later won it a second consecutive week on July 15, becoming the first Pirate since &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Bay\"&gt;Jason Bay&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 to do so.

On defense, he had a .997 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt; (2nd-best among NL outfielders), and a 2.37 range factor/game (4th).\nMcCutchen finished third in the NL &lt;a href=\"Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt; voting, behind San Francisco's &lt;a href=\"Buster%20Posey\"&gt;Buster Posey&lt;/a&gt; and Milwaukee's &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Braun\"&gt;Ryan Braun&lt;/a&gt;.

On September 3, 2013, facing &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; pitcher &lt;a href=\"Yovani%20Gallardo\"&gt;Yovani Gallardo&lt;/a&gt;, he hit his 100th career home run.\nMcCutchen was named to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2013 NL All Star Team&lt;/a&gt;, becoming an All Star for the third straight year as a reserve.\nMcCutchen finished the 2013 regular season batting .317 (7th in the National League)/.404 (3rd)/.508 (6th), with 185 hits and a 23.6 power-speed number (3rd), 78 walks and 12 intentional walks (4th), 97 runs (6th), 121 singles and 38 doubles (7th), 21 home runs, 84 RBIs, and 27 stolen bases (6th), which marked the fifth straight year he stole 20 or more bases.
