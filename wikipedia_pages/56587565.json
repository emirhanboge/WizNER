    "text": "Undertaking was a &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"thrash%20metal\"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; band formed in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. The band consisted of Gy\u00f6rgy Killan (lead vocals, guitar), Viktor Jakab (bass guitar) and Imre Eszt\u00e1ri (drums). Undertaking was active for only about a year, yet it became one of the most successful bands of the Hungarian thrash metal scene at the end of the 1980s. The members organized and ran the wildly popular monthly thrash metal event that operated under the banner of Thrash Mosh Club in &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Ajpest\"&gt;\u00dajpest&lt;/a&gt; (Budapest) at L\u00e4ndler Jen\u0151 M\u0171vel\u0151d\u00e9si H\u00e1z where they were the house band. The 7-song demo recorded in December 1988 titled \"V12BB4U\" and was distributed through mail order and small independent record shops. Singing in English made it next to impossible to have their music published through any official channels of the socialist Hungary of that era. Despite their popularity, Undertaking broke up at the end 1989 due to inner frictions. They played their last show at Vienna's Rockhaus opening for &lt;a href=\"Rage%20%28German%20band%29\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA book (hard cover, 545p) documenting the band's brief existence set against the backdrop of rapidly changing social structure in Hungary at the close of the nineties, written (in Hungarian) by \u00c1kos Dudich and Viktor Jakab, titled \"Undertaking \u2013 Thrash metal Magyarorsz\u00e1gon a rendszerv\u00e1lt\u00e1s idej\u00e9n\" (in English: \"Undertaking \u2013 Thrash metal in Hungary at the time of regime change\") was published in 2017 and included a CD of the band's re-issued demo tape with some previously unpublished bonus material.\nHistory.\nBefore Undertaking.\nGyorgy Killan, born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, where he received his rudimentary musical education and where his early forays into music included get-togethers with a couple of neighbourhood friends for loud noise making sessions on home-made instruments and calling themselves Children of Zeus, moved to Hungary in the mid-eighties and after a period of adjustment to the new life and learning the new language began his active pursuit of musical opportunities. He played guitar in a couple of local bands like Leopard and Metal Corpus with Zolt\u00e1n \u201cPici\u201d Fejes (who went on to found Classica). His self-recorded 1988 Killan demo tape received positive reviews (recording multiple instruments by himself bouncing tracks between two reel-to-reel tape decks was considered a novelty in those days) and brought some name recognition in the metal scene. His musical influences of the bands like &lt;a href=\"Metallica\"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kreator\"&gt;Kreator&lt;/a&gt; and above all &lt;a href=\"Slayer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; can be heard in this demo.\nViktor Jakab, born in &lt;a href=\"Miskolc\"&gt;Miskolc&lt;/a&gt;, Hungary, had played in the local band Reaktor before moving to Budapest to attend the University of Economics.\nKillan met Jakab at a friend's band's rehearsal where Viktor was auditioning for the bass guitar spot and convinced him to join forces.\nTogether they set off on a search of a drummer. Seeing Imre Eszt\u00e1ri of Neckrofight play at a gig they were immediately impressed by his skill level and drumming style they recruited him on the spot.\nAfter poaching Eszt\u00e1ri from Neckrofight they began rehearsing as a band and adopted the name Undertaking.\nThrash Mosh Club.\nL\u00e4ndler Jen\u0151 Cultural Centre was an underused Railroad Union Community Centre located in a run down area of \u00dajpest (a North/West district of Budapest) next to the train tracks and a station, that had a concert hall with a proper stage and holding capacity of over a thousand. The band found a place to practice there and it soon became home of their monthly metal fest nights - Thrash Mosh Club - the first of its kind in the country.\nEnlisting the marketing talents of P\u00e9ter \u201cManitou\u201d Somogyi, who has later become the band's manager and promotional skills of Zsolt \"G\u00fcl\u00fc\" G\u00fcrtler they were able to consistently put on a full 5-6 hour program once a month, showcasing the latest metal music videos (projected on an enormous movie screen), doing fun contests and comedy skits, finishing off with a live performance of several bands, with Undertaking, being the house band, as the closing act of the evening. The event became immensely popular in the underground metal scene, attracting crowds of up to a thousand and fans from all over Hungary and even some neighbouring countries. The club's stage became a magnet for many local (and some foreign) metal bands contributing to the diverse and ever changing guest band line up, bands like Atomic, Pestilence, Almighty, The Bedlam, Beyond, Mirror and many others.\nIn the pre-internet, pre-social media and pre-home computer era in Hungary all concert promotion had to be done the grass roots style - flyers and posters drawn by hand, band members and friends putting up posters and distributing flyers. One curios fact: several concert fliers and posters, as well as the Thrash Mosh Club logo were designed by a good friend of the band &lt;a href=\"Zoltan%20Bathory\"&gt;Zoltan Bathory&lt;/a&gt;, who was studying graphic design at the time and in more recent years has been touring the world with his own band &lt;a href=\"Five%20Finger%20Death%20Punch\"&gt;Five Finger Death Punch&lt;/a&gt; (USA).\nAfter the break up of Undertaking the Thrash Mosh Club organizers continued to put on isolated events for a few more years, but in the more recent times the concert hall was converted into a billiard hall and is now host to nationwide and international &lt;a href=\"snooker\"&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt; tournaments.\n\"V12BB4U\" demo and the \"Gar\u00e1zs\" compilation.\nBanking on the favourable currency exchange rates and on Killan's old music scene connections in his native Ukraine the band travelled to Kiev in December 1988 to record a 7-song demo (\"V12BB4U\" - read out with a thick Chinese or Russian accent it approximates \"We Want To Be Before You\").\nThe recording session took place at the Kiev's National Film Studios, which ordinarily recorded full orchestras for movie sound tracks. Due to the studio not being tailored to or having any experience recording metal, the resulting sound quality left much to be desired.\nDespite the poor sound quality the demo was warmly received back home with several hundred copies sold through mail order and independent record shops within a few months and has since become a collector's item.\nThe Demo Tape featured the following tracks:\n\"Garazs\" (Garage) was a compilation album of local indie bands - a brain child of &lt;a href=\"Nagy%20Fer%C3%B3\"&gt;Nagy Fer\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, at the time a well known rock musician and media persona with his own national radio show. Undertaking was offered a chance to submit a song for this LP. The album came out in 1989, but due to a mix-up (the master was submitted on a reel tape, with no time stamps the only way to identify the songs was to count them from the beginning) the wrong song (instead of \"Reactor #4\" as was printed on the label and jacket) \"The Runner\" was featured on it and the band's name was misprinted as \"Undertacking\".\nBreak-up.\nUndertaking disbanded in late 1989 with their last live performance in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; on 13 October 1989 opening for the Germany's &lt;a href=\"Rage%20%28German%20band%29\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt;. Inner tensions and lack of commitment were cited as the main reasons."
