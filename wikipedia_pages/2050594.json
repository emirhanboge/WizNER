    "text": "Lion was a 74-gun &lt;a href=\"third%20rate\"&gt;third rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ship%20of%20the%20line\"&gt;ship of the line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt;, which later served in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. She was named \"Lion\" on 23 April 1790 and built at &lt;a href=\"Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime\"&gt;Rochefort&lt;/a&gt; from August 1791 until June 1794. She was renamed Marat on 28 September 1793 (7 months before being launched) and then Formidable on 25 May 1795, with the changing fortunes of the French Revolution.\nShe took part in the &lt;a href=\"action%20of%206%20November%201794\"&gt;action of 6 November 1794&lt;/a&gt;, managing to &lt;a href=\"Raking%20fire\"&gt;rake&lt;/a&gt; .\nCapture in the Battle of Groix.\nFighting under captain &lt;a href=\"Charles-Alexandre%20L%C3%A9on%20Durand%20Linois\"&gt;Linois&lt;/a&gt; on 23 June 1795 at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Groix\"&gt;Battle of Groix&lt;/a&gt;, she was captured by near the French port of &lt;a href=\"Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt;. She was taken into service in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, but because the Navy already had a , she was renamed Belleisle, apparently in the mistaken belief that she had been captured off &lt;a href=\"Belle%20%C3%8Ele\"&gt;Belle \u00cele&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Groix\"&gt;\u00cele de Groix&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Trafalgar 1805.\nCaptained by &lt;a href=\"William%20Hargood\"&gt;William Hargood&lt;/a&gt;, she was the second ship in the British lee column at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt; in 1805, and as such was engaged by the Franco-Spanish ships , , , , , and . She was soon completely dismasted (the only British ship which suffered that fate), unable to man\u0153uvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45 minutes until the British ships behind her in the column came to her rescue. With 33 dead and 93 wounded, she was then towed to &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; after the battle by the frigate .\nDanish West Indies 1807.\nFollowing the concern in Britain that neutral &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; was entering an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Belleisle\" sailed as the flagship of Rear-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Cochrane\"&gt;Alexander Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded the squadron of ships that was sent to occupy the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20West%20Indies\"&gt;Danish West Indies&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron, which included &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Prince%20George%20%281772%29\"&gt;\"HMS Prince George\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Northumberland%20%281798%29\"&gt;\"HMS Northumberland\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Canada%20%281765%29\"&gt;\"HMS Canada\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Ramillies%20%281785%29\"&gt;\"HMS Ramillies\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Cerberus%20%281794%29\"&gt;\"HMS Cerberus\"&lt;/a&gt;, captured \"Telemaco\", \"Carvalho\", and \"Master\" on 17 April 1807. The &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20the%20Danish%20West%20Indies%20%281807%29\"&gt;actual occupation of the Danish West Indies&lt;/a&gt; did not occur until December, after receipt of news of the second &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Copenhagen%20%281807%29\"&gt;battle of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;.\nChannel Fleet.\nFrom 1811 she was in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; harbour, and in 1814 the decision was taken to have her broken up."
