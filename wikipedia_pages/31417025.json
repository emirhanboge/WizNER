    "text": "Juncus acutiflorus, also called sharp-flowered rush, is a &lt;a href=\"Juncaceae\"&gt;rush&lt;/a&gt; or a grassy plant of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Juncus\"&gt;Juncus&lt;/a&gt;\". As the name suggests, the plant has notable sharp-looking &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, flowering between July and September.\nDescription.\nThe plant has leaves shaped round or elliptical in cross-section, with darker horizontal lines visible against the light at intervals, like in the &lt;a href=\"Juncus%20articulatus\"&gt;jointed rush&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"pollination\"&gt;pollination&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href=\"branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;es emerge from the old ones and multiply to resemble a small &lt;a href=\"Shrub\"&gt;bush&lt;/a&gt;. The flowers have various shades of warm brown and maroon. Fruits look like a small pointed capsule. It grows straight and measures about 3 feet tall. The leaves are straight, smooth and circular in section, hollow, with transverse septa making the leaf feel jointed while touching and holding.\nEcology and habitat.\nThe plant commonly grows on acid soils in swampy &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;s and wet &lt;a href=\"heathland\"&gt;heathland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt;s. The species is widespread in the areas of and nearby northern &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. This plant is sensitive to &lt;a href=\"nitrate\"&gt;nitrate&lt;/a&gt; levels in the environment. In a &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; rich-fen, &lt;a href=\"chlorosis\"&gt;chlorosis&lt;/a&gt; has been noted in stands of \"Juncus acutiflorus\" at locations where groundwater containing high levels of nitrate reached the surface. Experiments revealed that the chlorosis could be attributed to &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; deficiency although iron levels in the shoots were well above the known physiological threshold values for iron deficiency. Nowadays, nitrate concentrations in ground water as high 1000\u00a0\u03bcM are no longer an exception in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar species.\nThe species resembles \"&lt;a href=\"Juncus%20articulatus\"&gt;Juncus articulatus&lt;/a&gt;\" (the jointed rush) known by the common names 'jointed rush' and 'jointleaf rush'. It is native to &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; and much of &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It grows in moist areas, such as wet sand, and thrives in &lt;a href=\"calcareous\"&gt;calcareous&lt;/a&gt; soils. This is a &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; herb producing a mainly erect stem from a short &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;. The stem may root at nodes, and it generally has one or more cylindrical leaves up to 10 centimeters long. It resembles this species as the leaves appear same, but the tepals are completely different. They are almost blackish-brown, and the main branches are often almost horizontal in the jointed rush.\nHybrids.\nTwo hybrids or subspecies of sharp-flowered rush are known \u2013 \"Juncus acutiflorus\" subsp. \"acutiflorus\" (also called \"Juncus acutiflorus\" t.infr. \"effusus\" and \"Juncus acutiflorus\" var. \"exoletus\") and \"Juncus acutiflorus\" ssp. \"rugosus\". They are formed by the hybridization of sharp-flowered rush and the smaller-sized jointed rush."
