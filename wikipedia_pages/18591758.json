    "text": "Bonguk geom (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt; \ubcf8\uad6d\uac80 \"&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3A%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%8B\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3A%E5%8A%8D\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;\", also \"singeom\" \uc2e0\uac80 \"Silla sword\") in &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20era\"&gt;Joseon era&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korean%20martial%20arts\"&gt;Korean martial arts&lt;/a&gt; (17th to 18th centuries) referred both to a type of &lt;a href=\"Korean%20sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and a style of &lt;a href=\"Korean%20swordsmanship\"&gt;swordsmanship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term was introduced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Muyesinbo\"&gt;Muyesinbo&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1759, and the system was supposedly a creation of &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Prince%20Sado\"&gt;Crown Prince Sado&lt;/a&gt;. It contrasts with &lt;a href=\"Jedok%20geom\"&gt;Jedok geom&lt;/a&gt;, or \"admiral sword\", a system supposedly introduced by the Chinese admiral &lt;a href=\"Li%20Rusong\"&gt;Li Rusong&lt;/a&gt; during the 16th-century &lt;a href=\"Imjin%20War\"&gt;Imjin War&lt;/a&gt; (the \"national sword\" system is conspicuously absent from the older \"&lt;a href=\"Muyejebo\"&gt;Muyejebo&lt;/a&gt;\" manual of 1610).\nThe \"Muyesinbo\" stresses the antiquity of this \"national\" Korean system by including the narrative of a Silla \"&lt;a href=\"Hwarang\"&gt;Flower Youth&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"Hwangchang\", who killed &lt;a href=\"Baekje\"&gt;Baekje&lt;/a&gt;'s king while performing a &lt;a href=\"sword%20dance\"&gt;sword dance&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Geommu\"&gt;Geommu&lt;/a&gt;, at the court. \nThe historical swords of the Silla period would have been double-edged and comparable to those of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Han\"&gt;Eastern Han&lt;/a&gt; dynastic period (see also &lt;a href=\"Hwandudaedo\"&gt;Hwandudaedo&lt;/a&gt;). However, the Bonguk geom, as presented in the 18th-century manual, is historically based on a single-edged sword; a type common during that era.\nIn contemporary schools of &lt;a href=\"Korean%20swordsmanship\"&gt;Korean swordsmanship&lt;/a&gt;, the term \"bonguk geom\" is used to emphasize their \"national\" Korean character, without necessarily bearing a direct relation to the 18th-century system."
