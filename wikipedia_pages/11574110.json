    "text": "USS \"Seagull\" (MCS(O)-55/AMS-55/YMS-402) was a built for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"Seagull\" was laid down as \"YMS-402\" on 24 July 1942 by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20B.%20Nevins%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Henry B. Nevins, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20Island%2C%20Bronx\"&gt;City Island, Bronx&lt;/a&gt;; launched on 17 April 1943; and commissioned on 26 June 1943, Lt. (JG.) J.W. Gaines, &lt;a href=\"USNR\"&gt;USNR&lt;/a&gt;, in command.\nIn mid-August 1943, \"YMS-402\" reported for duty in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Sea%20Frontier\"&gt;Eastern Sea Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. For the next year, she operated out of the Naval Frontier Base, &lt;a href=\"Tompkinsville%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;Tompkinsville, Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 August 1944, she departed that base for &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%2C%20California\"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, and duty in the central &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;, on 20 November, the motor &lt;a href=\"Minesweeper%20%28ship%29\"&gt;minesweeper&lt;/a&gt;, as a unit of &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Squadron\"&gt;Mine Squadron&lt;/a&gt; 102, remained in the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Islands\"&gt;Gilberts&lt;/a&gt; force for the next nine months, conducting local &lt;a href=\"Minesweeper%20%28ship%29\"&gt;minesweeping&lt;/a&gt;, escort, and patrol operations, and making an occasional escort into the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Islands\"&gt;Western Carolines&lt;/a&gt;. After the cessation of hostilities in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, she prepared for postwar minesweeping activities; and, at the end of August 1945, she sailed for &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the fall, she participated in the opening of &lt;a href=\"Nagoya\"&gt;Nagoya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wakayama%2C%20Wakayama\"&gt;Wakayama&lt;/a&gt;; and, with the new year, 1946, she headed back to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. After stops in the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshalls&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt;, she arrived at &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20California\"&gt;San Pedro, California&lt;/a&gt;, in early April. She remained on the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;west coast&lt;/a&gt; into the summer; and, at the end of June, she sailed for &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, where she was decommissioned on 1 August 1946.\nPlaced in service again, \"YMS-402\" departed New York on 30 October and moved north to the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Lawrence%20River\"&gt;St. Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, whence she proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, where she served as a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve\"&gt;naval reserve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"School%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; until after the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;war in Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Named USS \"Seagull\" and redesignated AMS-55 on 1 September 1947 and recommissioned on 10 May 1950, the former YMS returned to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; in September 1951 and took up training duties in the &lt;a href=\"5th%20Naval%20district\"&gt;5th Naval district&lt;/a&gt;. Initially based at &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and then at the Mine Warfare School, &lt;a href=\"Yorktown%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Yorktown, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe continued to operate out of the &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Roads\"&gt;Hampton Roads&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Capes\"&gt;Virginia Capes&lt;/a&gt; area through 1954. Then, in 1955, \"Seagull\", redesignated \"MSC(O)-55\" on 7 February, was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, whence, for the remainder of her career, she conducted operations which took her along the southeastern &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Atlantic seaboard&lt;/a&gt;, along the \u2018&lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;gulf coast&lt;/a&gt;, and into the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; as a unit of &lt;a href=\"MinRon\"&gt;MinRon&lt;/a&gt; 4.\nIn mid-July 1957, the coastal minesweeper departed Charleston for &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, where she was decommissioned on 11 October and placed in reserve. Her name was struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Naval Vessel Register&lt;/a&gt; on 1 November 1959.\nAwards and honors.\n\"YMS-402\" earned one &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt; for her post-World War II minesweeping activities."
