    "text": "A set tool is a &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; meant to be struck by a &lt;a href=\"hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;, either a &lt;a href=\"sledge%20hammer\"&gt;sledge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"power%20hammer\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;. Set tools are usually made with a handle to keep the smith a safe distance from the action. Set tools for the &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, where they are struck with a &lt;a href=\"sledgehammer\"&gt;sledgehammer&lt;/a&gt;, often have a wooden handle set into the head in the same way as a hammer. Set tools are sometimes handled by wrapping a thick wire handle around a groove in the body of the tool. Set tools to be used under a power hammer are much shorter than traditional and the handle is usually arc welded on or forged integrally with the tool."
