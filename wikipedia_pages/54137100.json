    "text": "The Ma\u010dva War of 1268 was a brief conflict in the &lt;a href=\"Banate%20of%20Macs%C3%B3\"&gt;Duchy of Ma\u010dva&lt;/a&gt; (or Macs\u00f3), in the southern realm of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval Kingdom of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar.\nTaking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Civil%20War%20%281264%E2%80%931265%29\"&gt;internal conflict&lt;/a&gt; and its consequences in Hungary, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Uro%C5%A1%20I\"&gt;Stefan Uro\u0161 I&lt;/a&gt; brought an invasion force to &lt;a href=\"Ma%C4%8Dva\"&gt;Ma\u010dva&lt;/a&gt;, and did considerable damage to the city and the province in the spring of 1268. According to historian Judit G\u00e1l, when deciding on an invasion, those could also be taken into account that the Hungarian younger king &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20V%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the civil war (his daughter &lt;a href=\"Anna%20of%20Hungary%20%28Byzantine%20empress%29\"&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; was engaged to &lt;a href=\"Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos\"&gt;Andronikos Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt;), in addition to Stefan Uro\u0161 signed a peace treaty with the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ragusa\"&gt;Republic of Ragusa&lt;/a&gt; in early 1268 to conclude the decade-long war with the Dalmatian maritime republic.\nDuke &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20of%20Macs%C3%B3\"&gt;B\u00e9la of Macs\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; sought assistance from his grandfather &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;B\u00e9la IV&lt;/a&gt;, who sent a royal army commanded by &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Cs%C3%A1k%2C%20Ban%20of%20Severin\"&gt;Stephen Cs\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt;, who marched into the south in order to liberate the province. The arrival of Hungarian reinforcements from the north came to fight off the Serbs turned the tide of the conflict and Stefan Uro\u0161 was captured by the Hungarians, , in addition to acquisition of Serbian warfare flags. Hungary retained the fortress and the surrounding province, albeit with heavy losses. Because of Stephen Cs\u00e1k's leadership \u2013 a member of the queenly court \u2013 in the military campaign, a charter of Queen &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20the%20Cuman\"&gt;Elizabeth the Cuman&lt;/a&gt; in 1271 claims that the army was commanded by Queen &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Laskarina\"&gt;Maria Laskarina&lt;/a&gt; herself. Stephen Cs\u00e1k sent his \"&lt;a href=\"familiaris\"&gt;familiaris&lt;/a&gt;\" Nicholas, son of Mark from &lt;a href=\"Szepes%20County\"&gt;Szepes County&lt;/a&gt; to inform the royal couple of the victory. Several foreign envoys \u2013 from the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Byzantine Empire, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;Kingdom of France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Kingdom of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 were present when the news arrives, in addition to the personal attendance of King B\u00e9la's sons-in-law &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20V%20the%20Chaste\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leo%20I%20of%20Galicia\"&gt;Leo I of Galicia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20the%20Pious\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw the Pious&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle, a soldier &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Cs%C3%A1k\"&gt;Michael Cs\u00e1k&lt;/a&gt; bravely fought and captured two important Serbian barons: an unidentified son-in-law of King Stefan Uro\u0161 and a son of the monarch's treasurer in their full armor and with their horses in the sight of Duke B\u00e9la of Macs\u00f3. The duke's mother Duchess &lt;a href=\"Anna%20of%20Hungary%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Macs%C3%B3\"&gt;Anna of Macs\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; also testified his bravery in the royal court. Following the war, Michael agreed with the Serbs in a ransom of 800 &lt;a href=\"Mark%20%28unit%29\"&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt;s to release the two captured lords. He received 300 marks in cash, while the remaining amount (500 marks = 3,000 &lt;a href=\"Florin\"&gt;Florentine florins&lt;/a&gt;) was covered by a gem reliquary cross (\"staurotheke\"), which allegedly contained pieces of wood from the &lt;a href=\"True%20Cross\"&gt;True Cross&lt;/a&gt; upon which &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesus was crucified&lt;/a&gt;. King B\u00e9la IV and Queen Maria Laskarina intended to buy the relic from Michael, who thus requested landholdings from the royal couple, instead of an amount of money. B\u00e9la donated landed estates to him in &lt;a href=\"Somogy%20County%20%28former%29\"&gt;Somogy County&lt;/a&gt; in April 1269.\nAftermath.\nYounger King Stephen did not participate in the conflict, despite the argument of some historians, for instance &lt;a href=\"Jen%C5%91%20Sz%C5%B1cs\"&gt;Jen\u0151 Sz\u0171cs&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was involved in the post-war settlement: Stephen's firstborn daughter &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Hungary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Catherine&lt;/a&gt; was given in marriage to &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Dragutin\"&gt;Stephen Dragutin&lt;/a&gt;, the elder son and heir of King Stefan Uro\u0161.\nMa\u010dva was not to stay in Hungarian hands for much longer, however, for in 1284, Stephen Dragutin received Ma\u010dva from King &lt;a href=\"Ladislaus%20IV%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Ladislaus IV&lt;/a&gt;. The Hungarians restored their suzerainty over the Banate of Macs\u00f3 in 1319."
