    "text": "Albert of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg (12 November 1579 \u2013 19 December 1635 in &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;) was the younger son of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Louis%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-M%C3%BCnzenberg\"&gt;Philip Louis I&lt;/a&gt; of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg (1553-1580) and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Magdalena%20of%20Waldeck\"&gt;Countess Magdalena of Waldeck&lt;/a&gt; (1558-1599). The only sons of his parents to reach adulthood were Albert and his elder brother &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Louis%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-M%C3%BCnzenberg\"&gt;Philip Louis II&lt;/a&gt;. Albert's son &lt;a href=\"John%20Ernest%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-M%C3%BCnzenberg\"&gt;John Ernest&lt;/a&gt; was the last male member of the Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg line of the House of Hanau.\nRegency.\nWhen his father died in 1580, Albert and his brother were still minors and a regency was necessary. The regents were Counts &lt;a href=\"John%20VI%2C%20Count%20of%20Nassau-Dillenburg\"&gt;John VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg&lt;/a&gt; (1536\u20131606), &lt;a href=\"Louis%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Sayn-Wittgenstein\"&gt;Louis I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; (1568\u20131607) and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-Lichtenberg\"&gt;Philip IV, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg&lt;/a&gt; (1514\u20131590), who was replaced in 1585 by his son, Count &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-Lichtenberg\"&gt;Philip V of Hanau-Lichtenberg&lt;/a&gt; (1541\u20131599).\nAlbert's mother Magdalena remarried in 1581 to &lt;a href=\"John%20VII%2C%20Count%20of%20Nassau\"&gt;John VII, Count of Nassau&lt;/a&gt;, the son of his guardian and regent. She and her sons from her first marriage then moved to the Nassau court in &lt;a href=\"Dillenburg\"&gt;Dillenburg&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, this was a centre of &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinism&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The court in Dillenburg maintained cordial relations with the Reformed court of the &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate\"&gt;Electorate of the Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Philip IV of Hanau-Lichtenberg, Albert's &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; guardian, and later his son Philip V, vehemently resisted this Calvinist influence, though ultimately their resistance was in vain. Philip V tried to have the Lutheran Duke &lt;a href=\"Richard%2C%20Count%20Palatine%20of%20Simmern-Sponheim\"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Simmern-Sponheim\"&gt;Simmern-Sponheim&lt;/a&gt;, a younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Elector%20Palatine\"&gt;Elector Palatine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20III%2C%20Elector%20Palatine\"&gt;Frederick III&lt;/a&gt; appointed as co-regent. He managed to obtain a mandate to this effect from the &lt;a href=\"Reichskammergericht\"&gt;Reichskammergericht&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Calvinist prevented Richard's installation and prevented the people of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg from paying tribute to Duke Richard. Instead, they installed Duke &lt;a href=\"John%20Casimir%20of%20the%20Palatinate-Simmern\"&gt;John Casimir of the Palatinate-Simmern&lt;/a&gt; as \"upper guardian\", an honorary position, which nevertheless strengthened the Calvinist hold on Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg.\nThe end of the guardianship is difficult to determine. In 1600, the guardians had a dispute with Philip Louis II and ended their guardianship over him. However, Albert was still a minor in 1600 (at the time, the age of majority was 25), and the guardians continued their guardianship over him at least until he came of age in 1604. The guardians did not file their final account until urged to do so by Elector Palatine &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20IV%2C%20Elector%20Palatine\"&gt;Frederick IV&lt;/a&gt; in 1608.\nYouth.\nIn 1585, Albert enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"Herborn%20Academy\"&gt;Herborn Academy&lt;/a&gt;, where his brother also studied. In 1588, he enrolled in the of the , also in &lt;a href=\"Herborn%20%28Hesse%29\"&gt;Herborn&lt;/a&gt;. In 1591, he enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"university%20of%20Heidelberg\"&gt;university of Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;, where he was elected rector on 20 December 1591.\nReign.\nAlbert spent most of his life in a violent dispute with his brother Philip Louis II, his cousin &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Maurice%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-Munzenberg\"&gt;Philip Maurice&lt;/a&gt; (1605-1638), and his cousin's regent, his sister-in-law &lt;a href=\"Catharina%20Belgica%20of%20Nassau\"&gt;Catharina Belgica of Nassau&lt;/a&gt;. This dispute was fought partly in court, partly using military means. Albert demanded a &lt;a href=\"partition%20%28politics%29\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt; of the county. Philip Louis II, however, followed a decree from 1375, which prescribed &lt;a href=\"primogeniture\"&gt;primogeniture&lt;/a&gt; in the House of Hanau. When Philip Louis II came of age, his guardians sided with Albert in this dispute, leading to violent clashes between Philip Louis II and his former guardians.\nA compromise was reached, in which Albert received the districts of &lt;a href=\"Schwarzenfels\"&gt;Schwarzenfels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ortenberg%2C%20Hesse\"&gt;Ortenberg&lt;/a&gt;, the territories of the former monastery in Naumburg and Hanau's share of &lt;a href=\"Niddatal\"&gt;Assenheim&lt;/a&gt;. Albert then moved into &lt;a href=\"Burg%20Schwarzenfels\"&gt;Schwarzenfels Castle&lt;/a&gt;. However, the compromise did not end the dispute. Albert now demanded sovereignty, while Philip Louis II had only granted him economic use of the apanage.\nAlbert and his family were forced to leave Schwarzenfels Castle during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, probably in 1633. He fled to &lt;a href=\"Worms%2C%20Germany\"&gt;Worms&lt;/a&gt; and later to &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;, where he suffered serious financial problems.\nDeath.\nAlbert died on 19 December 1635, in exile in Strasbourg. The funeral sermon is preserved.\nWith Albert's death, the sovereignty dispute ended, his son and heir, &lt;a href=\"John%20Ernest%2C%20Count%20of%20Hanau-M%C3%BCnzenberg\"&gt;John Ernest&lt;/a&gt;, did not claim sovereignty, at least not until he eventually inherited all of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg.\nMarriage and issue.\nOn 16 August 1604, Albert married Countess &lt;a href=\"Ehrengard%20of%20Isenburg\"&gt;Ehrengard of Isenburg&lt;/a&gt; (1 October 1577 \u2013 20 September 1637 in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;). Some sources say her given name was \"Irmgard\". They had the following children:"
