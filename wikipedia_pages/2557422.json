Thereafter, the situation has stabilized even though large number of forces exist in this small municipality.\nIn 2009, Serbia opened a military base &lt;a href=\"Cepotina\"&gt;Cepotina&lt;/a&gt; five kilometers south of Bujanovac, to further stabilize the area.\nModern.\nToday, Bujanovac is located in the &lt;a href=\"P%C4%8Dinja%20District\"&gt;P\u010dinja District&lt;/a&gt; of southern Serbia.\nOn 7 March 2017, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Albania\"&gt;President of Albania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bujar%20Nishani\"&gt;Bujar Nishani&lt;/a&gt; made a historical visit to the municipalities of Bujanovac and Pre\u0161evo, in which &lt;a href=\"Albanians%20in%20Serbia\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt; form the ethnic majority.\nSettlements.\nAside from the town of Bujanovac, the municipality includes the following settlements:\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2002 census, the municipality of Bujanovac had a population of 43,302 people.
