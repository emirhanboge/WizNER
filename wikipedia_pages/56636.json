    "text": "Colombo (, ; , ) is the commercial &lt;a href=\"Capital%20city\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; and largest city of &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; by population. According to the &lt;a href=\"Brookings%20Institution\"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt;, Colombo metropolitan area has a population of 5.6\u00a0million, and 752,993 in the &lt;a href=\"Municipality\"&gt;Municipality&lt;/a&gt;. It is the financial centre of the island and a tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Region%20Megapolis\"&gt;Greater Colombo area&lt;/a&gt; which includes &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Jayawardenepura%20Kotte\"&gt;Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte&lt;/a&gt;, the legislative capital of Sri Lanka and &lt;a href=\"Dehiwala-Mount%20Lavinia\"&gt;Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia&lt;/a&gt;. Colombo is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is itself within the urban/suburban area of Colombo. It is also the administrative capital of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Province%2C%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Western Province&lt;/a&gt; and the district capital of &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20District\"&gt;Colombo District&lt;/a&gt;. Colombo is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life, colonial buildings and monuments.\nDue to its large &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; and its strategic position along the East\u2013West sea &lt;a href=\"trade%20route\"&gt;trade route&lt;/a&gt;s, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. It was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Independence%20Struggle\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Jayawardenepura%20Kotte\"&gt;Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte&lt;/a&gt;, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.\nLike many cities, Colombo's urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority, encompassing other &lt;a href=\"Mayor-council%20government\"&gt;municipal&lt;/a&gt; and urban councils such as Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Dehiwala Mount Lavinia Municipal Council, Kolonnawa Urban Council, Kaduwela Municipal Council, and Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha. The main city is home to a majority of Sri Lanka's corporate offices, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Famous landmarks in Colombo include &lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Green\"&gt;Galle Face Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viharamahadevi%20Park\"&gt;Viharamahadevi Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beira%20Lake\"&gt;Beira Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Racecourse\"&gt;Colombo Racecourse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Planetarium\"&gt;Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;University of Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dehiwala-Mount%20Lavinia\"&gt;Mount Lavinia beach&lt;/a&gt;, Dehiwala Zoological Garden, &lt;a href=\"Nelum%20Pokuna%20Mahinda%20Rajapaksa%20Theatre\"&gt;Nelum Pokuna Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Lotus%20Tower\"&gt;Colombo Lotus Tower&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;National Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe name 'Colombo', first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical &lt;a href=\"Sinhala%20language\"&gt;Sinhala&lt;/a&gt; name \"Kolon thota\", meaning \"port on the river &lt;a href=\"Kelani%20River\"&gt;Kelani&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAnother belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhala name \"Kola-amba-thota\" which means 'Harbour with leafy/green mango trees'. This coincides with &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Knox%20%28sailor%29\"&gt;Robert Knox&lt;/a&gt;'s history of the island while he was a prisoner in Kandy. He writes that \"On the West, the City of Columbo, so-called from a Tree the Natives call Ambo, (which bears the Mango-fruit) growing in that place; but this never bear fruit, but only leaves, which in their Language is Cola and thence they called the Tree Colambo: which the Christians in honour of &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt; turned to Columbo.\"\nThe author of the oldest Sinhala grammar, \"Sidatsangarava,\" written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. It lists \"naramba\" (to see) and \"kolamba\" (ford or harbour) as deriving from the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Vedda%20language\"&gt;Vedda language&lt;/a&gt;. \"Kolamba\" may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.\nHistory.\nAs Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persia\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Han%20dynasty\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; traders over 2,000 years ago. Traveller &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Battuta\"&gt;Ibn Battuta&lt;/a&gt; who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as \"Kalanpu\". Arabs, whose prime interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the &lt;a href=\"Sinhalese%20people\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms and the outside world. Their descendants now comprise the local &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Moors\"&gt;Sri Lankan Moor&lt;/a&gt; community.\nPortuguese era.\n&lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; explorers led by Dom &lt;a href=\"Louren%C3%A7o%20de%20Almeida\"&gt;Louren\u00e7o de Almeida&lt;/a&gt; first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kotte\"&gt;Kotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parakramabahu%20VIII\"&gt;Parakramabahu VIII&lt;/a&gt; (1484\u20131518), which enabled them to trade in the island's crop of &lt;a href=\"cinnamon\"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, which lay along with the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo. As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a &lt;a href=\"trading%20post\"&gt;trading post&lt;/a&gt; in Colombo. Within a short time, however, they expelled the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Moors\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; in 1517.\nThe Portuguese soon realised that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for the protection of their coastal establishments in India and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom. Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in &lt;a href=\"Goa\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;, India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital.\nThis part of Colombo is still known as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Fort&lt;/a&gt; and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo's &lt;a href=\"hotel%20rating\"&gt;five star&lt;/a&gt; hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as &lt;a href=\"Pettah%2C%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Pettah&lt;/a&gt; ( \"pi\u1e6da ko\u1e6duva\", \"outer fort\") and is a commercial hub.\nDutch era.\nIn 1638 the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given &lt;a href=\"Safe-conduct\"&gt;safe conduct&lt;/a&gt; out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Rijcklof%20van%20Goens\"&gt;Rijcklof van Goens&lt;/a&gt;) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;Dutch East India Company&lt;/a&gt; until 1796.\nBritish era.\nAlthough the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a &lt;a href=\"British%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;British military&lt;/a&gt; outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created &lt;a href=\"British%20overseas%20territories\"&gt;crown colony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"British%20Ceylon\"&gt;British Ceylon&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo.\nInitially, they placed the administration of the city under a \"&lt;a href=\"District%20collector\"&gt;Collector&lt;/a&gt;\", and John Macdowell of the &lt;a href=\"Madras%20Presidency\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20Agent%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Government Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of &lt;a href=\"Colonialism\"&gt;colonial rule&lt;/a&gt; had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in &lt;a href=\"self-governance\"&gt;self-governance&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Council%20of%20Ceylon\"&gt;Legislative Council of Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on 16 January 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000.\nDuring the time they were in control of the Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city &lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today.\nAfter independence.\nThis era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city's inhabitants and on the country as a whole, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and &lt;a href=\"proper%20names\"&gt;proper names&lt;/a&gt; were a significant result of the colonial era. These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.\nHistorically, Colombo referred to the area around the \"&lt;a href=\"Fort%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Fort&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pettah%20Market\"&gt;Pettah Market&lt;/a&gt;\" which is known for the variety of products available as well as the &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Clock%20Tower\"&gt;Khan Clock Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Municipal%20Council\"&gt;Colombo Municipal Council&lt;/a&gt;. More often, the name is used for the &lt;a href=\"Conurbation\"&gt;Conurbation&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Colombo\"&gt;Greater Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses several &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20council\"&gt;Municipal council&lt;/a&gt;s including &lt;a href=\"Kotte\"&gt;Kotte&lt;/a&gt;, Dehiwela and Colombo.\nAlthough Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s to Sri Jayawardanapura, it continues to be the island's commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20mission\"&gt;diplomatic mission&lt;/a&gt;s in Colombo.\nGeography.\nColombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The city has many canals and, in the heart of the city, the &lt;a href=\"Beira%20Lake\"&gt;Beira Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The lake is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Colombo and was used for centuries by colonists to defend the city. It remains a tourist attraction, hosting &lt;a href=\"regattas\"&gt;regattas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"theater\"&gt;theatrical events&lt;/a&gt; on its shores. The Northern and North-Eastern border of the city of Colombo is formed by the &lt;a href=\"Kelani%20River\"&gt;Kelani River&lt;/a&gt;, which meets the sea in a part of the city known as the Modera (\"m\u014ddara\" in Sinhala) which means &lt;a href=\"river%20delta\"&gt;river delta&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nColombo features a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Am\") under the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;, falling just short of a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Af\"). Colombo's climate is hot throughout the year. From March to April the average high temperature is around . The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt; seasons from April to June and September to November, when heavy rains occur. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average . Rainfall in the city averages around a year.\nAttractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Green\"&gt;Galle Face Green&lt;/a&gt; is located in the heart of the city along the Indian Ocean coast and is a destination for tourists and residents alike. The &lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Hotel\"&gt;Galle Face Hotel&lt;/a&gt; is a historic landmark on the southern edge of this promenade.\n&lt;a href=\"Gangaramaya%20Temple\"&gt;Gangaramaya Temple&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important temples in Colombo. The temple's architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian and Chinese architecture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Viharamahadevi%20Park\"&gt;Viharamahadevi Park&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Victoria Park) is an urban park located next to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;National Museum of Colombo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;. It is the oldest and largest park in Colombo and features a large Buddha statue.\nAs part of the Urban Regeneration Program of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Government of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, many old sites and buildings were revamped to modern public recreational spaces and shopping precincts. These include &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Memorial%20Hall\"&gt;Independence Memorial Hall Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pettah%20Floating%20Market\"&gt;Pettah Floating Market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Colombo%20Dutch%20Hospital\"&gt;Old Dutch Hospital&lt;/a&gt; among others.\nDemographics.\nColombo is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city. The population of Colombo is a mix of numerous ethnic groups, mainly &lt;a href=\"Sinhalese%20people\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamils\"&gt;Sri Lankan Tamils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Moor\"&gt;Sri Lankan Moor&lt;/a&gt;. There are also small communities of people with &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20people%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Burghers\"&gt;Portuguese Burgher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Burghers\"&gt;Dutch Burgher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Malays\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indians%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; origins living in the city, as well as numerous European expatriates. Colombo is the most populous city in Sri Lanka, with 642,163 people living within the city limits. In 1866 the city had a population of around 80,000.\nGovernment and politics.\nLocal government.\nColombo is a &lt;a href=\"charter%20city\"&gt;charter city&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"mayor-council%20government\"&gt;mayor-council government&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor and council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the &lt;a href=\"United%20National%20Party\"&gt;United National Party&lt;/a&gt; (UNP), a &lt;a href=\"Right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; leaning party, whose business friendly policies resonate with the population of Colombo. However the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected, and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections. &lt;a href=\"Uvais%20Mohamed%20Imitiyas\"&gt;Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.\nThe city government provides sewer, road and waste management services, in the case of water, electricity and telephone utility services the council liaises with the water supply and drainage board, the Ceylon electricity board and telephone service providers.\nNational capital.\nColombo was the capital of the coastal areas controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British from the 1700s to 1815 when the British gained control of the entire island following the Kandian convention. From then until the 1980s the national capital of the island was Colombo. During the 1980s plans were made to move the administrative capital to &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Jayawardenepura%20Kotte\"&gt;Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte&lt;/a&gt; and thus move all governmental institutions out of Colombo to make way for commercial activities. As a primary step, the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; was moved to a new complex in Kotte, with several ministries and departments also relocated. However, the move was never completed. Today many governmental institutions still remain in Colombo. These include the &lt;a href=\"President%27s%20House%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;President's House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Secretariat\"&gt;Presidential Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%27s%20House%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Prime Minister's House&lt;/a&gt; (Temple Trees), &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%27s%20Office%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Supreme Court of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bank%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Central Bank of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, important government ministries and departments; such as &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Finance%20and%20Planning%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt; (Treasury), &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Defence&lt;/a&gt;, Public Administration &amp; Home affairs, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Foreign affairs&lt;/a&gt;, Justice and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20Headquarters%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Military headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, Naval headquarters (&lt;a href=\"SLNS%20Parakrama\"&gt;SLNS Parakrama&lt;/a&gt;), Air Force headquarters (&lt;a href=\"SLAF%20Colombo\"&gt;SLAF Colombo&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Police\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; national and field force headquarters.\nCityscape.\nCity limits.\nColombo is divided into 15 numbered areas for the purposes of postal services. Within these areas are the suburbs with their corresponding post office.\nEconomy.\nThe great majority of Sri Lankan corporations have their head offices in Colombo including &lt;a href=\"Aitken%20Spence\"&gt;Aitken Spence&lt;/a&gt;, Ceylinco Corporation, Stassen group of companies, &lt;a href=\"John%20Keells%20Holdings\"&gt;John Keells Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cargills%20%28Ceylon%29\"&gt;Cargills&lt;/a&gt;, Hemas Holdings and Akbar Brothers. Some of the industries include chemicals, textiles, glass, cement, leather goods, furniture and jewellery. In the city centre is the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Center%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;World Trade Centre&lt;/a&gt;. The 40-story &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Tower\"&gt;Twin Tower&lt;/a&gt; complex is the centre of important commercial establishments, in the Fort district, the city's nerve centre. Right outside the Fort area is Pettah which is derived from the Sinhala word \"pita\" which means 'out' or 'outside'.\nThe Colombo Metropolitan area has a GDP (PPP) of $122\u00a0billion or 40% of the GDP, making it the most important aspect of the Sri Lankan economy. The per capita income of Colombo Metro area stood at US$8623 and purchasing power per capita of $25,117, making it one of the most prosperous regions in South Asia. The Colombo Metropolitan (CM) area is the most important industrial, commercial and administrative centre in Sri Lanka. A major share of the country's export-oriented manufacturing takes place in the CM area which is the engine of growth for Sri Lanka.\n The Western province contributes less than 40% to the GDP and about 80% of industrial value additions although it accounts for only 5.7% of the country's geographic area and 25% of the national population. Given its importance as the primary international gateway for Sri Lanka and as the main economic driver of the country, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has launched an ambitious program to transform Colombo and its area into a metropolis of international standards. Bottlenecks are preventing the Colombo metropolitan area from realizing its full economic potential. To facilitate the transformation of Colombo, the government has to address these bottlenecks which have for long been obstructing economic and physical urban regeneration.\nPettah is more crowded than the Fort area. Pettah's roads are always packed and &lt;a href=\"Sidewalk\"&gt;pavements&lt;/a&gt; are full of small stalls selling items from delicious &lt;a href=\"sharbat\"&gt;sharbat&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"shirt\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt;s. Main Street consists mostly of clothes shops and the crossroads, which are known as Cross-Streets where each of the five streets specialises in a specific business. For example, First Cross Street is mostly &lt;a href=\"electronics\"&gt;electronic&lt;/a&gt; goods shops, the Second &lt;a href=\"cellular%20phones\"&gt;cellular phones&lt;/a&gt; and fancy goods. Most of these businesses are dominated by Muslim traders. At the end of Main Street further away from Fort is Sea Street \u2013 Sri Lanka's gold market \u2013 dominated by Tamil interests. This mile-long street is full of jewellery shops, including the former head office of &lt;a href=\"SriLankan%20Airlines\"&gt;SriLankan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaw enforcement and crime.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Police\"&gt;Sri Lanka Police&lt;/a&gt; the main law enforcement agency of the island liaise with the municipal council but is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; of the central government. Policing in Colombo and its suburbs falls within the \"Metropolitan Range\" headed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Metropolitan), this also includes the Colombo Crime Division. As with most Sri Lankan cities, the magistrate court handles felony crimes, the district court handles civil cases. \nAs in other large cities around the world, Colombo experiences certain levels of &lt;a href=\"street%20crime\"&gt;street crime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bribery\"&gt;bribery&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the corruption extends to the very top, US reports show. In addition, in the period from the 1980s to 2009 there have been a number of major terrorist attacks. The &lt;a href=\"LTTE\"&gt;LTTE&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to most of the bombings and assassinations in the city. &lt;a href=\"Welikada%20Prison\"&gt;Welikada Prison&lt;/a&gt; is situated in Colombo and it is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the country.\nInfrastructure.\nColombo has most of the amenities that a modern city has. Compared to other parts of the country, Colombo has the highest degree of infrastructure. Electricity, water and transport to street lights and phone booths, to a considerably good standard. The majority of the major shopping malls in Sri Lanka are in the city, of which all are &lt;a href=\"Wi-Fi\"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; enabled. Apart from that, many luxurious hotels, clubs and restaurants are in the city. In recent times there have been an outpour of &lt;a href=\"High-rise\"&gt;high rise&lt;/a&gt; condominiums, mainly due to the very high land prices.\nHarbour.\n&lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;Colombo Harbour&lt;/a&gt; is the largest and one of the busiest &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;s in Sri Lanka. Colombo was established primarily as a port city during the colonial era, with an artificial harbour that has been expanded over the years. The &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Navy\"&gt;Sri Lanka Navy&lt;/a&gt; maintains a &lt;a href=\"naval%20base\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt;, \"SLNS Rangalla\", within the harbour.\nThe Port of Colombo handled 3.75\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"twenty-foot%20equivalent%20unit\"&gt;twenty-foot equivalent unit&lt;/a&gt;s in 2008, 10.6% up on 2007 (which itself was 9.7% up on 2006), bucking the global economic trend. Of those, 817,000 were local shipments with the rest transshipments. With a capacity of 5.7\u00a0million TEUs and a dredged depth of over 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft), the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world and ranks among the top 25 ports (23rd).\nColombo is part of the &lt;a href=\"21st%20Century%20Maritime%20Silk%20Road\"&gt;21st Century Maritime Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region with its rail connections to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport.\nBus.\nColombo has an extensive public transport system based on &lt;a href=\"bus\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;es operated both by private operators and the government-owned &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Transport%20Board\"&gt;Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB)&lt;/a&gt;. The three primary bus terminals \u2013 Bastian Mawatha, Central and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals \u2013 are in Pettah. Bastian Mawatha handles long-distance services whereas Gunasinghapura and Central handle local services.\nRail.\nTrain transport &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Railways%23Commuter%20Rail\"&gt;in the city&lt;/a&gt; is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. However, the Central Bus Stand and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Railway%20Station%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Fort Railway Station&lt;/a&gt; function as the island's primary hub for bus and rail transport respectively. Up until the 1970s, the city had &lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; services, which were discontinued. Other means of transport includes &lt;a href=\"auto%20rickshaws\"&gt;auto rickshaws&lt;/a&gt; (commonly called \"three-wheelers\") and &lt;a href=\"taxicab\"&gt;taxicab&lt;/a&gt;s. Three-wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.\nRoads.\nPost-war development in the Colombo area also involves the construction of numerous expressway grade arterial road routes. The first of these constructed is the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Expressway%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Southern Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, which goes from &lt;a href=\"Kottawa\"&gt;Kottawa&lt;/a&gt;, a southern suburb of Colombo, to &lt;a href=\"Matara%2C%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Matara&lt;/a&gt; City in the south of the country. Expressways constructed in the Colombo metropolitan area include the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%E2%80%93Katunayake%20Expressway\"&gt;Colombo\u2013Katunayake Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, which was opened in October 2013 and the Colombo orbital bypass Outer Circular Highway (&lt;a href=\"Outer%20Circular%20Highway\"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke Expressway&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Colombo-Katunayake%20Expressway\"&gt;Colombo-Katunayake Expressway&lt;/a&gt; (E03) runs from &lt;a href=\"Peliyagoda\"&gt;Peliyagoda&lt;/a&gt;, a northern suburb of Colombo, to &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Colombo International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and it is linked with one of the major commercial hubs and a major tourist destination of the country, the city of &lt;a href=\"Negombo\"&gt;Negombo&lt;/a&gt;.\nFerry.\nAn international ferry liner, the &lt;a href=\"Scotia%20Prince\"&gt;Scotia Prince&lt;/a&gt;, is conducting a ferry service to &lt;a href=\"Tuticorin\"&gt;Tuticorin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Ferry services between the two countries have been revived after more than 20 years.\nAir.\n&lt;a href=\"Ratmalana%20Airport\"&gt;Ratmalana Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the city's airport, located south of the city centre. It commenced operating in 1935 and was the country's first international airport until it was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bandaranaike%20Airport\"&gt;Bandaranaike Airport&lt;/a&gt; in 1967. Ratmalana Airport now primarily services domestic flights, aviation training and international corporate flights.\nLandmarks.\nThe two &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Center%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;World Trade Centre&lt;/a&gt; towers used to be the most recognised landmarks of the city. Before they were completed in 1997, the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Ceylon\"&gt;Bank of Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent city landmark. Before the skyscrapers were built it was the Old Parliament Building that stood majestically in the Fort district with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Colombo%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Old Colombo Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; close to it. Another important landmark is the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Commemoration%20Hall%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Independence Hall&lt;/a&gt; at Independence Square in Cinnamon Gardens.\nEven before the parliament was built some claim that the &lt;a href=\"Jami%20Ul-Alfar%20Mosque\"&gt;Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque&lt;/a&gt; was recognised as the landmark of Colombo by &lt;a href=\"sailors\"&gt;sailors&lt;/a&gt; approaching the &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt; is still one of the most visited tourist sites in Colombo.\nAnother landmark is St.Paul's Church &lt;a href=\"Milagiriya\"&gt;Milagiriya&lt;/a&gt;, one of the oldest &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt; in Sri Lanka, first built by the Portuguese and rebuilt by the British in 1848. The Cargills &amp; Millers building in Fort is also a protected building of historical significance.\nThe Galle Face Green is the city's largest and most elegant &lt;a href=\"promenade\"&gt;promenade&lt;/a&gt;. Lined with &lt;a href=\"coconut%20trees\"&gt;coconut trees&lt;/a&gt; and adjacent to the coast, this mile-long stretch in the heart of the city is a constant beehive of activity. The green is especially busy on Fridays and Saturdays. In the evenings it plays host to families and children playing sports and &lt;a href=\"Kite%20flying\"&gt;flying kites&lt;/a&gt;, lovers embracing under umbrellas and health enthusiasts taking their evening walks. There are numerous small food stalls and a small stretch of beach. The Green frequently hosts international and local concerts and performances, such as the World Drum Festival.\n&lt;a href=\"Cannon\"&gt;Cannon&lt;/a&gt;s that were once mounted on the rampart of the old fort of Colombo laid out for observance and prestige at the Green, giving a colonial touch to the city. The colonial styled &lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Hotel\"&gt;Galle Face Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, known as Asia's Emerald on the Green since 1864, is adjacent to Galle Face Green. The hotel has played host to guests such as the &lt;a href=\"British%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;British Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"royal%20family\"&gt;royal&lt;/a&gt; guests and celebrities. After a stay at the hotel, &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%2C%20Countess%20of%20Frederiksborg\"&gt;Princess Alexandra&lt;/a&gt; of Denmark commented that \"the peacefulness and generosity encountered at the &lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Hotel\"&gt;Galle Face Hotel&lt;/a&gt; cannot be matched.\" Also facing Galle Face Green is the &lt;a href=\"Ceylon%20Inter-Continental\"&gt;Ceylon Inter-Continental&lt;/a&gt; Hotel, Sri Lanka's first &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20rating\"&gt;five-star&lt;/a&gt; hotel. Around the corner from Galle Face are prominent &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; bars, chic bars and boutiques.\nEducation.\nEducation institutions in Colombo have a long history. Colombo has many of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Public%20school%20%28UK%29\"&gt;public schools&lt;/a&gt; in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule, such as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20Colombo\"&gt;Royal College Colombo&lt;/a&gt; established in 1835. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of British who established Christian missionary schools. These include the &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%27s%20College%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Bishop's College&lt;/a&gt;(1875); the &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20College%20Colombo\"&gt;Wesley College Colombo&lt;/a&gt; (1874); the &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ananda%20College\"&gt;Ananda College&lt;/a&gt; (1886); the &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zahira%20College%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Zahira College&lt;/a&gt; (1892); the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Benedict%27s%20College%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;St. Benedict's College, Colombo&lt;/a&gt; (1985), the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%27s%20College%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;St. Joseph's College&lt;/a&gt; (1896). The religious alignments do not affect the curriculum of the school except for the demographics of the student population. Colombo has many International Schools that have come up in the recent years.\nHigher education in the city has a long history, beginning with the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Colombo Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (1870), the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Law%20College\"&gt;Colombo Law College&lt;/a&gt; (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the Government Technical College (1893). The first step in the creation of a University in Colombo was taken in 1913 with the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20Colombo\"&gt;University College Colombo&lt;/a&gt; which prepared students for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20London%20External%20System\"&gt;external examinations&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20London\"&gt;University of London&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ceylon\"&gt;University of Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; in Colombo. Today the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;University of Colombo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Visual%20%26amp%3B%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;University of the Visual &amp; Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; are state universities in the city. The &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Institute%20of%20Information%20Technology\"&gt;Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; has a metropolitan campus in the city centre. There are several private higher education institutions in the city.\nArchitecture.\nColombo has wildly varying architecture that span centuries and depict many styles. &lt;a href=\"colonial%20architecture\"&gt;Colonial&lt;/a&gt; buildings influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; exist alongside structures built in &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20architecture\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20architecture\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20architecture\"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20India\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20architecture\"&gt;Contemporary&lt;/a&gt; architectural styles. No other place is this more evident in the Fort area. Here one may find new towering skyscrapers as well as historic buildings dating far back as the 1700s.\nColombo Fort.\nThe Portuguese were the first colonists to settle in Colombo; establishing a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort on the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Harbour\"&gt;Colombo Harbour&lt;/a&gt;, began demolishing the ramparts to make way for the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is &lt;a href=\"Pettah%2C%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Pettah, Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; or \"Pitakotuwa\" in Sinhala which means outer fort.\nDutch-era buildings.\nThere are none of the buildings of the Portuguese era and only a few from the Dutch period. These include the oldest building in the fort area, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Colombo%20Dutch%20Hospital\"&gt;former Dutch Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, the Dutch House which is now the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Dutch%20Museum\"&gt;Colombo Dutch Museum&lt;/a&gt; and several churches. The &lt;a href=\"President%27s%20House%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;President's House&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Queen's House) was originally the Dutch governor's house and successive British governors made it their office and residence. However, it has undergone much change since the Dutch period. Adjoining the President's House are the Gordon Gardens, now off-limits to the public.\nBritish-era buildings.\nMuch of the old buildings of the fort area and in other parts of the city date back to the British times, these include governmental, commercial buildings and private houses. Some of the notable government building of British colonial architecture includes; the old Parliament building which is now the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Secretariat\"&gt;Presidential Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Building%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Republic Building&lt;/a&gt; which houses the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Ministry of Foreign affairs&lt;/a&gt;, but once housed the Ceylon Legislative council, the &lt;a href=\"General%20Treasury%20Building\"&gt;General Treasury Building&lt;/a&gt;, the old &lt;a href=\"General%20Post%20Office%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;General Post Office&lt;/a&gt; an Edwardian style building opposite the President's House, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%27s%20Office%20%28Colombo%29\"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Telegraph%20Office%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Central Telegraph Office&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Royal%20College%20Building%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Mathematics department&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;University of Colombo&lt;/a&gt; (formally the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Royal College, Colombo&lt;/a&gt;). Notable commercial buildings of the British era include the &lt;a href=\"Galle%20Face%20Hotel\"&gt;Galle Face Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, Cargills and Millers' complex and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Oriental%20Hotel\"&gt;Grand Oriental Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nAnnual cultural events and fairs.\nColombo's most popular festival is the celebration of &lt;a href=\"Gautama%20Buddha\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;'s birth, enlightenment and death all falling on the same day. In Sinhala this is known as \"&lt;a href=\"Vesak\"&gt;Vesak&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring this festival, much of the city is decorated with lanterns, lights and special displays of light (known as \"thoran\"). The festival falls in mid-May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in \"dunsal\" which means charity place. These \"dunsal\" are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.\nSince there is a large number of Muslims in Colombo. Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha are two Islamic festivals that are celebrated in Colombo. Many businesses flourish during the eventual countdown for Eid Ul Fitr which is a major Islamic festival celebrated by Muslims after a month-long fasting. Colombo is generally very busy during the eve of the festivals as people do their last-minute shopping.\nChristmas is another major festival. Although Sri Lanka's Christians make up only just over 7% of the population, Christmas is one of the island's biggest festivals. Most streets and commercial buildings light up from the beginning of December and festive sales begin at all shopping centres and department stores. Caroling and nativity plays are frequent sights during the season.\nThe Sinhalese and Hindu Aluth Awurudda' is a cultural event that takes place on 13 and 14 April. This is the celebration of the Sinhalese and Hindu new year. The festivities include many events and traditions that display a great deal of Sri Lankan culture.\nSeveral old clubs of the city give a glimpse of the British equestrian lifestyle; these include the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Club\"&gt;Colombo Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orient%20Club\"&gt;Orient Club&lt;/a&gt;, the 80 Club, the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Colombo Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerforming arts.\nColombo has several &lt;a href=\"performing%20arts\"&gt;performing arts&lt;/a&gt; centres, which are popular for their musical and theatrical performances, including the &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Wendt%20Art%20Centre\"&gt;Lionel Wendt Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, the Elphinstone and Tower Hall, all of which were made for western-style productions. The &lt;a href=\"Navarangahala\"&gt;Navarangahala&lt;/a&gt; found in the city is the country's first &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt;al &lt;a href=\"theatre%20%28structure%29\"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt; designed and built for Asian and local style musical and theatrical productions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nelum%20Pokuna%20Mahinda%20Rajapaksa%20Theatre\"&gt;Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre&lt;/a&gt; is a world-class theatre that opened in December 2011. Designed in the form of the Lotus Pond in &lt;a href=\"Polonnaruwa\"&gt;Polonnaruwa&lt;/a&gt;, the theatre is a major theatre destination.\nMuseums and art collections.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20National%20Museum\"&gt;National Museum of Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, established on 1 January 1877 during the tenure of the British Colonial Governor &lt;a href=\"Sir\"&gt;Sir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Gregory\"&gt;William Henry Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, is in the Cinnamon Gardens area. The museum houses the &lt;a href=\"crown%20jewels\"&gt;crown jewels&lt;/a&gt; and throne of the last king of the kingdom of Kandy, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Vikrama%20Rajasinha\"&gt;Sri Vikrama Rajasinha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is also the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Dutch%20Museum\"&gt;Colombo Dutch Museum&lt;/a&gt; detailing the Dutch colonial history of the country. Colombo does not boast a very big art gallery. There is a small collection of random Sri Lankan paintings at the Art Gallery in Green Path; next to it is the Natural History Museum.\nSports.\nOne of the most popular sports in Sri Lanka is &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;. The country emerged as champions of the 1996 &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and became runners up in 2007 and 2011. In the &lt;a href=\"ICC%20World%20Twenty20\"&gt;ICC World Twenty20&lt;/a&gt; they became runners up in 2009 and 2012 and winners in 2014. The sport is played in parks, playgrounds, beaches and even in the streets. Colombo is the home for two of the country's most popular &lt;a href=\"International%20structure%20of%20cricket\"&gt;international cricket&lt;/a&gt; stadiums, &lt;a href=\"Singhalese%20Sports%20Club\"&gt;Singhalese Sports Club&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20Stadium\"&gt;Cricket Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R.%20Premadasa%20Stadium\"&gt;R. Premadasa Stadium&lt;/a&gt; (named after late president &lt;a href=\"Premadasa\"&gt;Premadasa&lt;/a&gt;).\nColombo has the distinction of being the only city in the world to have four cricket test venues in the past: &lt;a href=\"Paikiasothy%20Saravanamuttu%20Stadium\"&gt;Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Singhalese%20Sports%20Club%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Cricket%20Club%20Ground\"&gt;Colombo Cricket Club Ground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranasinghe%20Premadasa%20Stadium\"&gt;Ranasinghe Premadasa Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sugathadasa%20Stadium\"&gt;Sugathadasa Stadium&lt;/a&gt; is an international standard stadium for &lt;a href=\"Sport\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, also held the &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;South Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 and 2006. Situated in Colombo the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Colombo%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Royal Colombo Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest in Asia. Other sporting clubs in Colombo include &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Swimming%20Club\"&gt;Colombo Swimming Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Rowing%20Club\"&gt;Colombo Rowing Club&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yachting%20Association%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Yachting Association of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is also a popular sport at the club and school level. Colombo has its local football team &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20FC\"&gt;Colombo FC&lt;/a&gt; and the sport is being developed as a part of the FIFA Goal program.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Port%20City\"&gt;Colombo Port City&lt;/a&gt; is to include a new Formula One track, constructed in the vicinity of the Colombo Harbour. According to Dr Priyath Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, an eight-lane F1 track will \"definitely\" be a part of the New Port City. This would host the Sri Lankan Grand Prix.\n&lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Marathon\"&gt;Colombo Marathon&lt;/a&gt; is an internationally recognised &lt;a href=\"marathon\"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt; established in 1998.\nMedia.\nAlmost all major media businesses in Sri Lanka operate from Colombo. The state media has its offices in Bullers Road and does carry out the regional transmission from there. This includes the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SLBC), formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Ceylon\"&gt;Radio Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%20Rupavahini%20Corporation\"&gt;Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. The SLBC is the oldest radio station in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; and the second oldest in the world. Many of the private broadcasting companies have their offices and transmission stations in or around Colombo. As with most metro areas, radio bands are highly utilised for radio communications. Some of the prominent radio stations broadcasting in the Colombo area are &lt;a href=\"Sirasa%20FM\"&gt;Sirasa FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FM%20Derana\"&gt;FM Derana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hiru%20FM\"&gt;Hiru FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shakthi%20FM\"&gt;Shakthi FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vettri%20FM\"&gt;Vettri FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sooriyan%20FM\"&gt;Sooriyan FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiss%20FM%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Kiss FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lite%2089.2\"&gt;Lite FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yes%20FM\"&gt;Yes FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20FM%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29\"&gt;Gold FM&lt;/a&gt;, Sith FM, Y FM and many more.\nTelevision networks operating in the Colombo metro area include the state-owned television broadcasting networks which are broadcast from the Rupavahini Corporation of Sri Lanka, broadcasting television in the official languages Sinhala and Tamil. English language television is also broadcast, more targeted to the demographics of the English speaking Sri Lankans, expatriate communities and tourists. There are as well several private operators. Many of the privately run television station networks were often based upon operational expansions of pre-existing commercial radio networks and broadcast infrastructure.\nFurther reading.\nThe following books contain major components on Colombo:"
