He later joined the &lt;a href=\"Our%20Future\"&gt;Our Future&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Future%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Future Party&lt;/a&gt;) but quit later. In 2020, he founded a new political party, named the &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Citizens\"&gt;For the Citizens&lt;/a&gt; (soon renamed as &lt;a href=\"Platform%20Party\"&gt;Platform Party&lt;/a&gt;), along with &lt;a href=\"Woo%20Hee-jong\"&gt;Woo Hee-jong&lt;/a&gt;.

In December 2018, he cited that Moon, who called himself as a \"pro-labour\" was forwarding a failed labour reforms. As an example, he added Moon's original manifesto to increase the &lt;a href=\"minimum%20wage\"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; was not fulfilled. He also denounced that Moon's policies were more &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Myung-bak\"&gt;Lee Myung-bak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;Park Geun-hye&lt;/a&gt; due to the several projects i.e. privatisation.\nIn 2019, he harshly criticised &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Shinzo%20Abe\"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;, citing that Shinzo wants to establish a &lt;a href=\"Japanophilia\"&gt;pro-Japan&lt;/a&gt; government in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nCriticisms.\nIn 2019, Choi joined protests supporting &lt;a href=\"Cho%20Kuk\"&gt;Cho Kuk&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Minister of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the minister had resigned following the controversies. Choi then shouted in front of people, \"Dear Cho Kuk, you're our eternal Justice Minister!\" Shortly before this, he condemned the prosecutor and anti-government medias for infringing the former Justice Minister, like what they had done to the ex-&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Moo-hyun\"&gt;Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/a&gt; 10 years ago. When Choi founded the Platform Party, &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jin-tae%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Jin-tae&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"United%20Future%20Party\"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt; MP denounced the party as a \"pro-Cho Kuk party\", citing a Choi's remarks (calling the ex-Minister as the \"eternal\") in October 2019."
