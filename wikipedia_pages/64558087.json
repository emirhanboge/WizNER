I think that\u2019s the best for development because you actually learn to love your sport rather than it be forced upon you\".\nTriathlon competitions.\nThe following list is based upon the official &lt;a href=\"ITU%20World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;ITU&lt;/a&gt; rankings and the &lt;a href=\"ITU%20World%20Triathlon%20Series\"&gt;ITU's&lt;/a&gt; Athlete Profiles\".\" Unless indicated otherwise, the following events are triathlons in the Elite Men's category."
