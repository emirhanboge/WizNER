After a career as a &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineering\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt; before and after serving in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, he became widely recognised as one of the leading English painters of marine subjects.\nEarly life.\nGardner was born in &lt;a href=\"Buckinghamshire\"&gt;Buckinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;. His father was a &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineering\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt; who worked for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Central%20Railway\"&gt;Great Central Railway&lt;/a&gt; in the docks at &lt;a href=\"Grimsby\"&gt;Grimsby&lt;/a&gt; and became chief engineer of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Glasgow\"&gt;Port of Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; in 1928, and Gardner developed a love of ships.\nHe was educated at &lt;a href=\"Oundle%20School\"&gt;Oundle School&lt;/a&gt;, where he won a prize for his drawing. He left school in 1931, and trained as a civil engineer in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"London%20Midland%20%26amp%3B%20Scottish%20Railway\"&gt;London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway&lt;/a&gt;. He later joined &lt;a href=\"Sir%20William%20Arrol%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; He joined the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20Volunteer%20Reserve\"&gt;RNVR&lt;/a&gt; as a 20-year-old &lt;a href=\"midshipman\"&gt;midshipman&lt;/a&gt;, and took up painting &lt;a href=\"watercolour\"&gt;watercolour&lt;/a&gt;s of warships. He became a docks engineer at &lt;a href=\"North%20Shields\"&gt;North Shields&lt;/a&gt; in 1938.\nSecond World War.\nGardner was called up in August 1939, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, and served as anti-submarine officer on the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Broke%20%28D83%29\"&gt;HMS \"Broke\"&lt;/a&gt;. His ship escorted convoys in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, and was then posted to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Torch\"&gt;Operation Torch&lt;/a&gt; landings in &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Terminal\"&gt;Operation Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, the storming of &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; harbour in November 1942. The destroyers HMS \"Broke\" and &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Malcolm%20%28D19%29\"&gt;HMS \"Malcolm\"&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with securing the port facilities and power station at Algiers. \"Malcolm\" came under fire and was forced to withdraw with engine damage, but \"Broke\" rammed through a boom protecting the harbour and disembarked its shore party. \"Broke\" then also came under heavy fire from &lt;a href=\"Vichy%20French\"&gt;Vichy French&lt;/a&gt; forces and was forced to withdraw. \"Broke\" sank the next day while heading for &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;. Her crew, including Gardner, were rescued by the destroyer &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Zetland%20%28L59%29\"&gt;HMS \"Zetland\"&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Algiers, now captured by the Allies, before returning to England on a Dutch liner. The convoy was attacked by a submarine: the &lt;a href=\"escort%20carrier\"&gt;escort carrier&lt;/a&gt; immediately ahead, , was &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;ed and sank. Gardner had been injured in Algiers, and was rendered &lt;a href=\"deaf\"&gt;deaf&lt;/a&gt; in one ear. He was later &lt;a href=\"mentioned%20in%20dispatches\"&gt;mentioned in dispatches&lt;/a&gt; for his actions.\nHe joined the destroyer &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Highlander%20%28H44%29\"&gt;HMS \"Highlander\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1943, serving again in the Atlantic, but his deafness then forced him to serve on land rather than at sea. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20commander\"&gt;lieutenant commander&lt;/a&gt; and served on the staff of Admiral Sir &lt;a href=\"Max%20Horton\"&gt;Max Horton&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Approaches\"&gt;Western Approaches&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the war, he was an acting &lt;a href=\"commander\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt;, serving as Assistant Chief Staff Officer Ceylon, based in &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"demobilised\"&gt;demobilised&lt;/a&gt; in 1946.\nHe was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Volunteer%20Reserve%20Decoration\"&gt;Volunteer Reserve Decoration&lt;/a&gt; (VRD).\nPost-war career.\nGardner joined the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Service\"&gt;Colonial Service&lt;/a&gt; after the war, serving in &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; from 1951. He met his wife, Mary, at a dance in &lt;a href=\"Mombasa\"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt;. He then worked as an engineer in west Kenya, living in &lt;a href=\"Kisumu\"&gt;Kisumu&lt;/a&gt; beside &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Victoria\"&gt;Lake Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Nakuru\"&gt;Nakuru&lt;/a&gt;, where he painted oils, watercolours and pastels of local scenes, such as flamingos on a nearby soda lake.\nHe caught &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"typhus\"&gt;typhus&lt;/a&gt;, and became deaf in both ears. He returned to England with his family in 1963, and retired to &lt;a href=\"Dorset\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt;. He turned to painting maritime subjects. His detailed paintings found a ready market, and he held several exhibitions in London. He is best known for his paintings of warships from the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;, and paintings of &lt;a href=\"clipper\"&gt;clipper&lt;/a&gt;s from later in the 19th century.\nAn exhibition of his work at &lt;a href=\"Messum%27s\"&gt;Messum's&lt;/a&gt; gallery in &lt;a href=\"Mayfair\"&gt;Mayfair&lt;/a&gt; in October 2005, the bicentenary of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;, included paintings of every ship in which &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt; had served. A book of the paintings, \"Nelson's Ships: A Trafalgar Tribute\".\nHe was a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers\"&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, and also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Marine%20Artists\"&gt;Royal Society of Marine Artists&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was survived by his wife, and their son and daughter."
