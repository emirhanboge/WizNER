    "text": "The Ireland Funds are a global &lt;a href=\"fundraising\"&gt;fundraising&lt;/a&gt; network for people of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; ancestry and friends of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to raising funds to support programs of peace and reconciliation, arts and culture, education and community development throughout the island of Ireland. The Funds exist in 12 countries around the world, the largest member of the network being \"The American Ireland Fund\", and, after &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Philanthropies\"&gt;Atlantic Philanthropies&lt;/a&gt;, may be the second largest non-governmental donor to Irish causes. The global chairman of The Ireland Funds is &lt;a href=\"Tony%20O%27Reilly\"&gt;Tony O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;. They have raised over $550 million for worthy causes in Ireland and around the world.\nHistory.\nThe American Irish Foundation.\nDuring his visit to Ireland in 1963, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; joined with &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera\"&gt;\u00c9amon de Valera&lt;/a&gt; to form \"The American Irish Foundation\". The mission of this organization was to foster connections between &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Americans\"&gt;Americans of Irish descent&lt;/a&gt; and the country of their ancestry.\nThe Ireland Fund.\nIn 1976, Dr. Anthony J.F. O'Reilly (Sir &lt;a href=\"Tony%20O%27Reilly\"&gt;Tony O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;), former CEO of &lt;a href=\"H.J.%20Heinz%20Co.\"&gt;H.J. Heinz Co.&lt;/a&gt; (as well as a former Ireland &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player), created \"The Ireland Fund\" with friend and fellow &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; businessman &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Rooney\"&gt;Dan Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, owner of the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team, who later served as the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Ireland\"&gt;United States Ambassador to Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. With three goals, \"Peace, Culture and Charity\", The Ireland Fund appealed for support for Ireland and its people from all Americans, especially those of Irish descent.\nMerger.\nOn &lt;a href=\"St.%20Patrick%27s%20Day\"&gt;St. Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt; 1987, The Ireland Fund and the American Irish Foundation led by Arthur William Bourn Vincent &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx%3Fn%3Darthur-william-bourn-vincent%26amp%3Bpid%3D160668841\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; merged at a &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; ceremony to form &lt;a href=\"The%20American%20Ireland%20Fund\"&gt;The American Ireland Fund&lt;/a&gt; and to become the world's largest private organization funding constructive change in Ireland, both in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapters of The American Ireland Fund.\nOver the following decade, The Ireland Funds formed a thriving fundraising network of chapters in additional cities across the United States as &lt;a href=\"The%20American%20Ireland%20Fund\"&gt;The American Ireland Fund&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;\nInternational chapters.\nIn parallel with expansion within the USA, Ireland Funds were established in a range of countries, from Ireland itself to Canada (launched 1978), Australia (launched 1987), Great Britain (1988), France (1990), New Zealand (1992), Germany (1993), Japan (1993), Monaco (1998), China (1998) and Singapore (2009).\nGlobal headquarters.\nShared world headquarters for The Ireland Funds were opened in Boston in 1994.\nToday.\nWith over 100 events annually in 40 cities around the world, attended by 40,000 people, and raising over $550 million since 1976, The Ireland Funds is one of the largest non-governmental organizations helping Ireland. It does most of its work by choosing and contributing to the work of other NGOs.\nAlthough The American Ireland Fund remains the largest component of The Ireland Funds structure, there are also chapters in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, Monaco, Singapore, New Zealand, and Ireland.\nOrganization.\nThe Ireland Funds have their world headquarters in Boston, with offices in New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Toronto, Dublin, London and Sydney.\nPublicity.\nThe organisation has had an active website since 1996, with four major relaunches since then.\nGovernance and staffing.\nThe Ireland Funds are overseen by voluntary directors at various levels, and have regional and global staff. Each country or chapter has its own governance body, such as a Board of Directors, with operations led by a local regional or executive director."
