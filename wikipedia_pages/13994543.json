    "text": "Northwood High School (Northwood) is located in Silver Spring and is one of five high schools that are part of Montgomery Downcounty Consortium. Northwood offers a number of academies for students as well as a variety of sports and clubs. In 2018, Northwood's six academies include Montgomery Middle College (MC2); Music, Theater and Dance; Politics, Advocacy and Law; Technological, Environmental and System Sciences; Humanities, Arts and Media; and Finance, Accounting, Marketing and Education.\nNorthwood originally opened its doors in 1956. The school was closed after 29 years in 1985 due to changing demographics in the area. As the need for additional space for high school students grew in later years, the Montgomery County Public School System re-opened Northwood in 2004.\nThe principal was Mildred Charley-Greene. She was appointed principal to Northwood in 2013 and was named 2019 Principal of the Year by the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nNorthwood High School is located in &lt;a href=\"unincorporated%20area\"&gt;unincorporated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%20Public%20Schools%20%28Maryland%29\"&gt;Montgomery County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the &lt;a href=\"Kemp%20Mill%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Kemp Mill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"census-designated%20place\"&gt;census-designated place&lt;/a&gt;, and it has a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Silver Spring&lt;/a&gt; postal address.\nHistory.\nIn order to relieve overcrowding in local schools adjacent to major federal installations or defense projects, President Eisenhower signed Title 45 Public Law 81-874 \"ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION\" with $1,500,000 contributed to Montgomery County. It was decided to build a new high school along 30 Acres on Old Bladensburg Road (later known as University Blvd) in Silver Spring with planned opening in fall 1956. The 2 story brick, tile, and glass rambler cost $1,955,143, with a student population of 1425. At its dedication &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20S.%20Adams\"&gt;Arthur S. Adams&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Council%20on%20Education\"&gt;American Council on Education&lt;/a&gt;, described the school as a \"Magnificent Building\" to a crowd of 1000 visitors. The Northwood area grew prior to construction. The new school became a combination junior / senior high school named Northwood Junior Senior High School with new principal Edward (Ted) A. Bartlett. Principal Bartlett was &lt;a href=\"Harvard\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; educated, a World War II veteran, and the former basketball coach from &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20High%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Winchester High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winchester%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Winchester, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of school September 1956, there was no working bell system, no mirrors in the wash rooms, no lockers, no cafeteria. They used whistles to mark start-stop of class periods.\nOn February 1, 1960 Harold R. Packard replaced Bartlett. Eugene R. Smoley became Principal in 1972. In 1977 Principal Bobby J. Mullis replaced Smoley, and retired at the 1985 closing.\nClosing.\nThe closing of Northwood High School was discussed and voted on 3 times by the &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Montgomery County&lt;/a&gt; School Board starting in 1981 and finally ordered closed in a contested decision that aimed to alleviate the concentration of minorities enrolling at &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20Blair%20High%20School\"&gt;Montgomery Blair High School&lt;/a&gt;. A nonprofit group, Northwood Community Solidarity Inc, was established to fight the closure. After the closing, school trophies were given to students, and alumni. The varsity uniforms were sold to students for $1. The Northwood Indian headdress was donated to Wheaton Library for display.\nFrom 1987 to 2004, Northwood was used to hold students from other high schools during renovations. The school was re-opened in 2004 due to increasing population. During its original run, the school's mascot was the &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Indians&lt;/a&gt;. A September 2001 vote by the Board of Education banned ethnic and race-based team mascots at county schools. Students in the first class and Alumni from the 1958 first graduating class chose the &lt;a href=\"Gladiator\"&gt;Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;s as the new mascot.\nReopening.\nPrior to the reopening the funds saved by the Northwood Community Solidarity for 20 years, $8,500, was donated to Northwood in memory of the late Bobby Mullis.\n2008 was the first year since the school reopened in which there were all four classes.

This expansion includes additional classrooms, reconfiguration of existing spaces and upgrades to building systems. It will bring the total student capacity to 2,700 students, an increase of 1,200 seats. During the upgrade, the school will operate out of the campus of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20W.%20Woodward%20High%20School\"&gt;Charles W. Woodward High School&lt;/a&gt;. This upgrade is scheduled to be completed by September 2025.\nWNHS.\nDuring the early 1970s, WNHS was a low-power AM radio station, used for broadcasting home football games.\nWNHS became the television and radio station at Northwood high school.
