The administrative centre is located 17\u00a0km north of &lt;a href=\"Banda%20Aceh\"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;. The city covers an area of 122.13 square kilometres and had a population of 30,653 people at the 2010 census and 43,391 at the 2020 Census. Sabang is also known as the northernmost and westernmost city of Indonesia; it is also the Indonesian city with the smallest population, by far, to be given the status of an administrative city.\nHistory.\nThe Japanese occupied the island and installed numerous bunkers, fortifications and gun emplacements. Their remnants can still be seen, though most have been re-purposed or removed. On 6 May 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy's submarine, the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20submarine%20I-29\"&gt;\"I-29\"&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with a &lt;a href=\"Yanagi%20missions\"&gt;\"Yanagi\"&lt;/a&gt; mission, landed the Indian leader and freedom fighter, Netaji &lt;a href=\"Subhash%20Chandra%20Bose\"&gt;Subhash Chandra Bose&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Abid%20Hasan\"&gt;Abid Hasan&lt;/a&gt; at Sabang on &lt;a href=\"Weh%20Island\"&gt;Weh Island&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid detection by British spies.\nOn 19 April 1944, the Japanese facilities were attacked by a combined Allied naval force in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Cockpit\"&gt;Operation Cockpit&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nIslands.\nFollowing islands in Indonesia are scattered around Sabang:\nAdministrative districts.\nThe city is divided into two &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt; (\"kecamatan\"), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census.\nVillages.\nSabang has 18 villages in its two districts (Sukajaya and Sukakarya).

The airport is located southeast of the central city on Weh Island.\nSabang Port.\nIndia-Indonesia port development.\nSabang has an ancient port on the historic &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Silk%20Route\"&gt;Maritime Silk Route&lt;/a&gt;. To enhance cooperation in the national and maritime security and safety, trade connectivity, infrastructure and economic development, the strategic partners India and Indonesia are jointly developing the Sabang deepsea port which also lies close to the India's southernmost territory of &lt;a href=\"Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands\"&gt;Andaman and Nicobar Islands&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002, &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Navy\"&gt;Indian Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Navy\"&gt;Indonesian Navy&lt;/a&gt; signed \"Ind-Indo Corpat\" agreement. In May 2018, \"Shared Vision of Maritime Cooperation in the Indo Pacific\" agreement was signed between these two nations when Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt; visited Indonesia. Consequently, both navies have been hosting bilateral \"Samudra Shakti\" naval exercise since November 2018 including in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Sea\"&gt;Java Sea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andaman%20Sea\"&gt;Andaman Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Indian naval ships have been regularly visiting Sabang port after the signing of the agreement. Several Indian navy ships undertook naval exercises and visits to Sabang e.g. a destroyer INS Rana in 2002, INS Sumitra in July 2018, INS VIJIT in 2019.\nIndonesia's minister for maritime affairs, &lt;a href=\"Luhut%20Binsar%20Pandjaitan\"&gt;Luhut Pandjaitan&lt;/a&gt;, stated that Indonesia has given economic and military access to India to strategic Sabang port which will invest in the port and economic zone of Sabang and build a hospital. He further stated that both India and Indonesia are large nations which do not need to lean towards any superpower, and that Indian navy ships will have access to the port which has 40 meter depth which is good for all vessels including submarines. Both nations started to discuss the Sabang port project in 2014. Shipping lanes passing through here are the global &lt;a href=\"Choke%20point\"&gt;Choke point&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia has \u201cglobal maritime fulcrum\u201d to counter balance the China's &lt;a href=\"Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative\"&gt;BRI&lt;/a&gt;, and this new India-Indonesia strategic partnership will balance the power in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;IOR&lt;/a&gt; and address the shared India-Indonesia's concerns about China's assertiveness in this region. Port is a key element of India's &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pacific\"&gt;Indo-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; strategy.\nInternational sail tourism event.\nThe City hosted an international sail tourism event in September 2011. The sail race was participated in by around 50 ships with 15 crew members each. Besides sailing they visited interesting places packed in a '&lt;a href=\"tsunami\"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;' tourism, visit &lt;a href=\"Weh%20Island\"&gt;Gapang Beach and Iboih Beach&lt;/a&gt; with enchanting underwater scenery.\n\"Sail Sabang 2017\" was held from Nov. 28 until Dec. 5 in Sabang. The event is the ninth installment of &lt;a href=\"Sail%20Indonesia\"&gt;Sail Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, an annual yacht rally that was first launched in 2009 on Bunaken Island, &lt;a href=\"North%20Sulawesi\"&gt;North Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;."
