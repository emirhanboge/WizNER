He began his education at the local school before winning a scholarship to attend &lt;a href=\"The%20Nelson%20Thomlinson%20School\"&gt;The Nelson Thomlinson School&lt;/a&gt;, Wigton. After the &lt;a href=\"armistice\"&gt;armistice&lt;/a&gt; he began playing rugby for his home town club, &lt;a href=\"Aspatria%20RUFC\"&gt;Aspatria RUFC&lt;/a&gt;.

He continued to captain the county side until 1926, when he accepted one of many offers to play &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league\"&gt;Rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, signing professional forms for &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham&lt;/a&gt;. In 1927, Oldham beat &lt;a href=\"Swinton%20Lions\"&gt;Swinton&lt;/a&gt; by 26 points to 7, in the first BBC broadcast Rugby League Challenge Cup final. Tosh scored three tries and became only the third man in the history of the final to achieve that recognition. F. W. (Basher) Ashworth, another native of Aspatria also played in that final. In 1996, &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Paul\"&gt;Robbie Paul&lt;/a&gt; also joined that elite grouping, playing for &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Bulls&lt;/a&gt; when they defeated &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;.

He retired from the game in 1931, when he returned to Aspatria to run a shop selling drapery and ironmongery. He died at Aspatria on 19 July 1969.\nThe eldest brother Jonathon (Jont) was a highly respected three-quarter back, won the first of his 32 county caps at the age of seventeen. He was a member of the Aspatria side that won the county cup in 1909, 1911 &amp; 1912, and beaten finalists in 1908 and 1910. Perhaps his greatest achievement came in 1913, when he played in the county side narrowly beaten by &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt; in the final of the county championship. On 18 November 1916, two individual telegrams arrived at the family home, regarding the disappearance of both Jont and his younger brother Alex, reports later substantiated.\nRugby union.\nHolliday played at fullback for &lt;a href=\"Aspatria%20RUFC\"&gt;Aspatria RUFC&lt;/a&gt;.

Holliday' Aspatria, Cumberland and England (Rugby Union.) \"Born in 1899 (&lt;a href=\"sic\"&gt;sic \"1898\"&lt;/a&gt;), T. Holliday has played a great part in the post-war success of Cumberland in the County Championship. A tower of strength to the Aspatria Club, he gained an international cap for England in 1923, and he has since played eight (&lt;a href=\"sic\"&gt;sic \"seven\"&lt;/a&gt;) times for England. Primarily he is a full-back, but for his club and for his country he has frequently played with success in the centre (&lt;a href=\"sic\"&gt;sic \"only as a fullback for England\"&lt;/a&gt;), and his sense of position has always stood him in good stead. He is a safe full-back, and although he does not have a kick of great length, he always makes sure of finding touch.\"\"\nNote.\nAlthough Holliday's nicknames were \"Tom\", or \"Tosh\", he is erroneously nicknamed \"Toff\" in some references."
