    "text": "The SS \"Luray Victory\" was the seventeenth &lt;a href=\"Victory%20ship\"&gt;Victory ship&lt;/a&gt;, a new 10,500 ton class ship built during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"California%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;California Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt; built the ship under the &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20Shipbuilding%20program\"&gt;Emergency Shipbuilding program&lt;/a&gt;. She was launched on May 11, 1944, and completed on June 26, 1944. The ship\u2019s &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Maritime%20Commission\"&gt;United States Maritime Commission&lt;/a&gt; designation was VC2-S-AP3, hull number 17 (V-17). The SS \"Luray Victory\" served in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; during World War II and was operated by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Diamond%20Steamship%20Company\"&gt;Black Diamond Steamship Company&lt;/a&gt;. \nDesign.\nVictory ships were designed to replace the outdated &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Ship\"&gt;Liberty Ship&lt;/a&gt;s. They would last longer and be able to serve the &lt;a href=\"US%20Navy\"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Victory ships differed from Liberty ships in that they were longer, wider, taller and faster. Victory ships had a thin stack set closer to the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; and had a long raised &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt;.\nChristening.\nThe SS \"Luray Victory\" was named after the city of &lt;a href=\"Luray%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Luray, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the 218 &lt;a href=\"Victory%20ship\"&gt;Victory ship&lt;/a&gt;s named after an American city. She was launched at the yards of the California Shipbuilding Corporation in &lt;a href=\"Wilmington%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Wilmington, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; on May 11, 1944. The ship was the seventeenth in a long line of Victory ships, many of which were built at the California Shipbuilding Corporation (\"Calship\") yard. Her engines were built by the Joshua Hendy iron works in California.\nWorld War II.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the SS \"Luray Victory\" operated in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20ocean\"&gt;Pacific ocean&lt;/a&gt; bringing supplies to the US and the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt;. On November 30, 1944, the SS \"Luray Victory\" reached &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was part of convoy GB 720 which carried supplies to forces fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Leyte\"&gt;Battle of Leyte&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Okinawa\"&gt;Battle of Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;. From June 26, 1945 to August 15, 1945, she prepared for &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Downfall\"&gt;Operation Downfall&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion of the Japanese home islands with exercises at &lt;a href=\"Leyte%20Island\"&gt;Leyte&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japan surrendered&lt;/a&gt; on 15 August 1945, the exercises were cancelled.\nShipwreck.\nIn January of 1946, the SS \"Luray Victory\" departed &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. She was transporting &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bremerhaven\"&gt;Bremerhaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20plan\"&gt;Marshall plan&lt;/a&gt;. She crossed the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; at a speed near her maximum 16.5 knots. In the night of January 30, 1946, the SS \"Luray Victory\" entered the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Dover\"&gt;Straits of Dover&lt;/a&gt;. She had no local &lt;a href=\"maritime%20pilot\"&gt;maritime pilot&lt;/a&gt; on board and was steaming too fast and too close to the shore. The ship ran aground at &lt;a href=\"Goodwin%20Sands\"&gt;Goodwin Sands&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Deal%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. She hit the sandbank hard and the engines stopped. By 9:00 p.m. the chief engineer had informed the captain that the engines were unable to be repaired. The captain of the ship sent a radio &lt;a href=\"distress%20signal\"&gt;distress signal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Coastguard\"&gt;coast guard&lt;/a&gt;. At 10:27 p.m. the coast guard found the ship. A rescue could not be made until morning due to a &lt;a href=\"low%20tide\"&gt;low tide&lt;/a&gt; and rough seas.\nOn the morning of January 31, 1946, the rescue tugs, HMS \"Lady Bassey\" and \"Persia\" tried to free the ship but the attempt was abandoned due to &lt;a href=\"gale\"&gt;gale&lt;/a&gt; force winds. At 4:00 p.m., the coast guard returned to find the SS \"Luray Victory\" breaking up and realised salvage was impossible. The forty-nine crew abandoned the ship, moved to shore by Freddie Upton, the life boat captain.\nThe top part of the shipwreck was visible for fifty years at 51\u00ba-ll'-04N, 001\u00ba-31'-62E.\nOn December 24, 1946, the &lt;a href=\"SS%20Northeastern%20Victory\"&gt;SS \"Northeastern Victory\"&lt;/a&gt; was also wrecked on the Goodwin Sands."
