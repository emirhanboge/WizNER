    "text": "Drawing down the Moon (also known as drawing down the Goddess) is a central &lt;a href=\"Ritual%23Religious%20rituals\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; in many contemporary &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt;n traditions. During the ritual, a &lt;a href=\"coven\"&gt;coven&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; enters a &lt;a href=\"trance\"&gt;trance&lt;/a&gt; and requests that the &lt;a href=\"Goddess\"&gt;Goddess&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Triple%20Goddess%20%28Neopaganism%29\"&gt;Triple Goddess&lt;/a&gt;, symbolized by the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20possession\"&gt;enter her body&lt;/a&gt; and speak through her. The High Priestess may be aided by the &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;, who invokes the spirit of the Goddess. During her trance, the Goddess speaks through the High Priestess.\nHistory.\nThe name most likely comes from a depiction of two &lt;a href=\"women\"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; and the moon on an &lt;a href=\"Art%20in%20Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vase\"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt;, believed to date from the second century BCE.\nIt could also come from line 145 of Claudian\u2019s First Book Against Rufinus. Megaera, one of the Erinyes, in the guise of an old man, speaks to Rufinus:\nIn classical times, the Greek astronomer &lt;a href=\"Aglaonice\"&gt;Aglaonice of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt; and ancient &lt;a href=\"Thessaly\"&gt;Thessalian&lt;/a&gt; witches were believed to control the moon, according to the &lt;a href=\"Tract%20%28literature%29\"&gt;tract&lt;/a&gt;: \"If I command the moon, it will come down; and if I wish to withhold the day, night will linger over my head; and again, if I wish to embark on the sea, I need no ship, and if I wish to fly through the air, I am free from my weight.\"\nThe drawing down of the moon derives from the &lt;a href=\"Aradia%2C%20or%20the%20Gospel%20of%20the%20Witches\"&gt;Vangelo&lt;/a&gt;. In this a poem defining the drawing down of the moon is written and this has been used as the basis for the drawing down of the moon by various Wiccan groups. The practice forms part of both Gardnerian and Cochranian rites. The practice is also reference in Reginald Scot's \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\".\nThough a number of Wiccan traditions may practice a variation of the ritual, the modern form likely originated in &lt;a href=\"Gardnerian%20Wicca\"&gt;Gardnerian Wicca&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered a central element of Gardnerian and &lt;a href=\"Alexandrian%20Wicca\"&gt;Alexandrian&lt;/a&gt; Wiccan ceremonies. During the modern rite, the High Priestess may recite the &lt;a href=\"Charge%20of%20the%20Goddess\"&gt;Charge of the Goddess&lt;/a&gt;, a text based in a mixture of writings by &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29\"&gt;Gerald Gardner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aleister%20Crowley\"&gt;Aleister Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, though now often used in its &lt;a href=\"recension\"&gt;recension&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Doreen%20Valiente\"&gt;Doreen Valiente&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess in the Gardnerian tradition.\nMel D. Faber explains the ritual in psychoanalytical terms of attempting to re-unite with the protective-&lt;a href=\"mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; archetype.\nIn modern traditions, some solitary Wiccans also perform the ritual, usually within a circle and performed under the light of a &lt;a href=\"full%20Moon\"&gt;full Moon&lt;/a&gt;. The solitary will stand in the Goddess Pose (both arms held high, palms up, body and arms forming a 'Y') and recite a charge, or chant.\nThe ritual in print.\n\"Drawing Down the Moon\" is also the title of a book by &lt;a href=\"National%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; reporter, &lt;a href=\"Margot%20Adler\"&gt;Margot Adler&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 \"\"\u2014originally published in 1979. Adler writes:\n...in this ritual, one of the most serious and beautiful in the modern Craft, the priest invokes into the priestess (or, depending on your point of view, she evokes from within herself) the Goddess or Triple Goddess, symbolized by the phases of the moon. She is known by a thousand names, and among them were those I had used as a child. In some Craft rituals the priestess goes into a trance and speaks; in other traditions the ritual is a more formal dramatic dialogue, often of intense beauty, in which, again, the priestess speaks, taking the role of the Goddess. In both instances, the priestess functions as the Goddess incarnate, within the circle."
