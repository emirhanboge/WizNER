    "text": "Lucy Eldine Gonzalez Parsons (born Lucia Carter; 1851 \u2013 March 7, 1942) was an American &lt;a href=\"labor%20movement\"&gt;labor organizer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"far-left%20politics\"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anarcho-communist\"&gt;anarcho-communist&lt;/a&gt;. She is remembered as a powerful orator. Parsons entered the radical movement following her marriage to newspaper editor &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Parsons\"&gt;Albert Parsons&lt;/a&gt; and moved with him from Texas to Chicago, where she contributed to the newspaper he famously edited \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Alarm%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;The Alarm&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFollowing her husband's 1887 execution in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Haymarket%20affair\"&gt;Haymarket affair&lt;/a&gt;, Parsons remained a leading American radical activist, as a founder of the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt; and member of other political organizations.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLucy Parsons was born Lucia Carter in &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in 1851. Her mother, Charlotte, was an African-American woman enslaved by a white man named Tolliver, who may have been Lucy's father. In 1863, during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Tolliver relocated to &lt;a href=\"Waco%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Waco, Texas&lt;/a&gt; with his slaves, dodging the enforcement of the &lt;a href=\"Emancipation%20Proclamation\"&gt;Emancipation Proclamation&lt;/a&gt; that set January 1st, 1863 as the date all enslaved people would be free.\nLittle is known about her life following the move to Texas. She worked as a seamstress and a cook for white families. Parsons lived with or was married to a former slave, Oliver Gathing, for a time prior to 1870. During this relationship, she had an infant which died at birth. In 1871, she married &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Parsons\"&gt;Albert Parsons&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; soldier. They were forced to flee north from Texas in 1873 due to intolerant reactions to their &lt;a href=\"Interracial%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;interracial marriage&lt;/a&gt;. During the journey, Parsons altered her first name to Lucy. The couple settled in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganizing.\nDescribed by the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Chicago Police Department&lt;/a&gt; as \"more dangerous than a thousand rioters\" in the 1920s, Parsons and her husband had become highly effective &lt;a href=\"anarchist\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; organizers primarily involved in the &lt;a href=\"labor%20movement\"&gt;labor movement&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century, but also participating in revolutionary &lt;a href=\"activism\"&gt;activism&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s, people of color, the homeless and women. She began writing for \"The Socialist\" and \"The Alarm\", the journal of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Working%20People%27s%20Association\"&gt;International Working People's Association&lt;/a&gt; (IWPA) that she and Parsons, among others, founded in 1883. Parsons worked closely with her friend and collaborator &lt;a href=\"Lizzie%20Holmes\"&gt;Lizzie Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in the early years of the 1880s, and the two of them led marches of working seamstresses in Chicago. In 1886 her husband, who had been heavily involved in campaigning for the &lt;a href=\"eight-hour%20day\"&gt;eight-hour day&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested, tried, and executed on November 11, 1887, by the state of Illinois on charges that he had conspired in the &lt;a href=\"Haymarket%20Riot\"&gt;Haymarket Riot&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an event which was widely regarded as a political &lt;a href=\"frame-up\"&gt;frame-up&lt;/a&gt; and which marked the beginning of &lt;a href=\"May%20Day\"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt; labor rallies in protest.\nParsons was invited to write for the French anarchist journal \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Temps%20nouveaux%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Les Temps Nouveaux&lt;/a&gt;\" and spoke alongside &lt;a href=\"William%20Morris\"&gt;William Morris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Kropotkin\"&gt;Peter Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt; during a visit to Great Britain in 1888.\nIn 1892 she briefly published a periodical, \"Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly\". She was often arrested for giving public speeches or distributing anarchist literature. While she continued championing the anarchist cause, she came into ideological conflict with some of her contemporaries, including &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Goldman\"&gt;Emma Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, over her focus on class politics over gender and sexual struggles.\nIn 1905 she participated in the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt; (IWW), and began editing the \"Liberator\", an anarchist newspaper that supported the IWW in Chicago. Lucy's focus shifted somewhat to class struggles around poverty and unemployment, and she organized the Chicago Hunger Demonstrations in January 1915, which pushed the American Federation of Labor, the Socialist Party, and &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Addams\"&gt;Jane Addams&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Hull%20House\"&gt;Hull House&lt;/a&gt; to participate in a huge demonstration on February 12. Parsons was also quoted as saying: \"My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production.\" Parsons anticipated the sit-down strikes in the US and, later, workers' &lt;a href=\"Recovered%20factory\"&gt;factory takeovers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1925 she began working with the National Committee of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Labor%20Defense\"&gt;International Labor Defense&lt;/a&gt; in 1927, a &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;-led organization that defended labor activists and unjustly-accused African Americans such as the &lt;a href=\"Scottsboro%20Boys\"&gt;Scottsboro Nine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Herndon\"&gt;Angelo Herndon&lt;/a&gt;. While it is commonly accepted by nearly all biographical accounts (including those of the &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Parsons%20Center\"&gt;Lucy Parsons Center&lt;/a&gt;, the IWW, and Joe Knowles) that Parsons joined the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20USA\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1939, there is some dispute, notably in Gale Ahrens' essay \"Lucy Parsons: Mystery Revolutionist, More Dangerous Than A Thousand Rioters\". Ahrens points out that the obituary the Communist Party had published on her death made no claim that she had been a member.\nConflict with Emma Goldman.\n&lt;a href=\"Emma%20Goldman\"&gt;Emma Goldman&lt;/a&gt; and Lucy Parsons represented different generations of anarchism. This resulted in ideological and personal conflict. Carolyn Ashbaugh has explained their disagreements in depth:\nIn 1908, after Captain Mahoney (of the New York City Police Department) crashed one of Goldman's lectures in Chicago, newspaper headlines read that every popular anarchist had been present for the spectacle, \"with the single exception of Lucy Parsons, with whom Emma Goldman is not on the best of terms.\" Goldman reciprocated Parsons's absence by endorsing Frank Harris' book \"The Bomb\", which was a largely fictional account of the Haymarket Affair and its martyrs' road to death. (Parsons had published \"The Famous Speeches of the Haymarket Martyrs\", a non-fictional, first-hand recounting of the Haymarket martyrs' final speeches in court.)\nParsons was solely dedicated to working class liberation, condemning Goldman for \"addressing large middle-class audiences\"; Goldman accused Parsons of riding upon the cape of her husband's martyrdom. \"[N]o doubt,\" Candace Falk wrote (\"&lt;a href=\"Love%2C%20Anarchy%2C%20and%20Emma%20Goldman\"&gt;Love, Anarchy, and Emma Goldman&lt;/a&gt;\"), \"there was an undercurrent of competitiveness between the two women. Emma generally preferred center stage.\" Goldman planned on preserving her place in the spotlight as an American anarchist laureate by shoving risqu\u00e9 sexual and kinship discourse into \"the center of a perennial debate among anarchists about the relative importance of such personal issues\".\nIn \"The Firebrand\", Parsons wrote, \"Mr. &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Rotter\"&gt;[Oscar] Rotter&lt;/a&gt; [a &lt;a href=\"free%20love\"&gt;free love&lt;/a&gt; advocate] attempts to dig up the hideous 'Variety' grub and bind it to the beautiful unfolding blossom of &lt;a href=\"emancipation%20of%20labour\"&gt;labor's emancipation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"wage-slavery\"&gt;wage-slavery&lt;/a&gt; and call them one and the same. Variety in sex relations and economic freedom have nothing in common.\" Goldman responded: \nParsons responded: \"The line will be drawn sharply at personalities as we know these enlighten no one and do infinitely more harm than good.\"\nGoldman, in her autobiography, \"&lt;a href=\"Living%20My%20Life\"&gt;Living My Life&lt;/a&gt;\", briefly mentioned the presence of \"Mrs. Lucy Parsons, widow of our martyred Albert Parsons\", at a Chicago labor convention, noting that she \"took an active part in the proceedings\". Goldman later would acknowledge Albert Parsons for becoming a socialist and anarchist, proceeding to praise him for having \"married a young &lt;a href=\"mulatto\"&gt;mulatto&lt;/a&gt;\"; there was no further mention of Lucy Parsons.\nDeath.\nParsons continued to give fiery speeches in Chicago's Bughouse Square into her 80s, where she inspired &lt;a href=\"Studs%20Terkel\"&gt;Studs Terkel&lt;/a&gt;. One of her last major appearances was a speech to striking workers at &lt;a href=\"International%20Harvester\"&gt;International Harvester&lt;/a&gt; (the successor to the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, whose striking workers played a role in the &lt;a href=\"Haymarket%20Affair\"&gt;Haymarket Affair&lt;/a&gt;) in February 1941.\nParsons died on March 7, 1942, in a house fire in the &lt;a href=\"Avondale%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;Avondale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Community%20Areas%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Community Area&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Her lover, George Markstall, died the next day from injuries he received while trying to save her. She was approximately 91 years old. After her death, police seized her library of over 1,500 books. She is buried near her husband at &lt;a href=\"German%20Waldheim%20Cemetery\"&gt;Waldheim Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; (now Forest Home Cemetery), near the &lt;a href=\"Haymarket%20Martyrs%27%20Monument\"&gt;Haymarket Martyrs' Monument&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Park%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Forest Park, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins and ethnicity.\nParsons refused to speak about her private life or origins. When asked for details about her history, she declared \"I am not a candidate for office, and the public have no right to my past. I amount to nothing to the world and people care nothing of me. I am battling for a principle.\" This stance has made research into her origins difficult for historians.\nParsons specifically denied that she was a child of a former slave of African descent, claiming that she was born in Texas and her parents were Mexican and Native American. She described herself as a \u201cSpanish-Indian maiden\u201d to explain her dark complexion. These personal myths persisted after her death: on her death certificate, her parents' names were listed as Pedro D\u00edaz and Marites Gonz\u00e1lez, both born in Mexico.\nLegacy, tributes and memorials.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Parsons%20Center\"&gt;Lucy Parsons Center&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. It continues as a collectively-run radical bookstore and infoshop.\nIn the 1990s, a local Chicago artist installed a memorial to Parsons in &lt;a href=\"Wicker%20Park%20%28Chicago%20park%29\"&gt;Wicker Park&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 2004, the city of Chicago named a park for Parsons.\nOn July 16, 2007, a book that purportedly belonged to Lucy Parsons was featured on a segment of the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Broadcasting%20Service\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; television series, \"&lt;a href=\"History%20Detectives\"&gt;History Detectives&lt;/a&gt;\". During the segment it was determined that the book, which was a biography of &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Parsons\"&gt;Albert Parsons&lt;/a&gt;' co-defendant &lt;a href=\"August%20Spies\"&gt;August Spies&lt;/a&gt;' life and trial, was most likely a copy published and sold by Parsons as a means of raising money to prevent her husband's execution. The segment also provided background on Parsons' life and the Haymarket Affair.\nOn October 15, 2015, a copy of William Morris's \"Signs of Change: Seven Lectures Delivered on Various Occasions\" was sold at auction in England. It was inscribed \"To Lucy E Parsons from William Morris November 15, 1888\", bore a \"Property of Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department of Justice\" stamp, and a \"Surplus Library of Congress Duplicate\" stamp; some of its pages showed traces of smoke damage.\nIn 2016, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nation\"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt; magazine released free and online a short film by animator Kelly Gallagher about Lucy Parsons, \"More Dangerous Than a Thousand Rioters: The Revolutionary Life of Lucy Parsons.\"\nThe organization Lucy Parsons Labs is a Chicago-based organization focused on digital rights and on-the-streets activism. In 2016 the organization released documents tracking the Chicago Police Department's use of cell-site simulators that connect to passer-by cellphones and store data for potential law enforcement use.
