    "text": "The gens Egnatia was a &lt;a href=\"plebeian\"&gt;plebeian&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"equites\"&gt;equestrian rank&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few of the Egnatii held any &lt;a href=\"Roman%20magistrate\"&gt;magistracies&lt;/a&gt;, of whom the most important may have been &lt;a href=\"Gnaeus%20Egnatius\"&gt;Gnaeus Egnatius&lt;/a&gt;, who held the &lt;a href=\"praetor\"&gt;praetor&lt;/a&gt;ship during the second century BC, and served as governor of &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after its institution as a Roman province.\nOrigin.\nThe Egnatii were of &lt;a href=\"Samnites\"&gt;Samnite&lt;/a&gt; origin, and at least some of them had settled at &lt;a href=\"Teano\"&gt;Teanum&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20War%20%2891%E2%80%9387%20BC%29\"&gt;Social War&lt;/a&gt;, the greater part of these appear to have removed to Rome, where two of them were admitted into the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Senate\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt;, though a branch of the family seems to have remained at Teanum.\nPraenomina.\nThe first of the Egnatii known to history bore the &lt;a href=\"Oscan%20language\"&gt;Oscan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"praenomen\"&gt;praenomina&lt;/a&gt; \"Gellius\" and \"Marius\". The Egnatii who settled at Rome favoured \"&lt;a href=\"Gnaeus%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Gnaeus&lt;/a&gt;\", but also made use of \"&lt;a href=\"Gaius%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Lucius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Publius%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Publius&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBranches and cognomina.\nThe Egnatii do not seem to have been divided into distinct families during the time of the Republic. Most of the Egnatii bore no &lt;a href=\"cognomen\"&gt;cognomen&lt;/a&gt;, but individuals are known with the surnames \"Celer, Maximus, Rufus\", and \"Veratius\". \"Celer\" means \"swift,\" while \"Maximus\" is \"great\" or \"greatest.\" \"Rufus\", meaning \"red,\" was typically given to someone with red hair or a ruddy complexion."
