He managed to lead the team out of relegation (14th place), adding &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;the conquest&lt;/a&gt; of the club's third &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 against &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the first in 60 years, and remained at the helm for a further two full years.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt;, Flores accepted a new challenge with &lt;a href=\"Real%20Zaragoza\"&gt;Real Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href=\"Aragon\"&gt;Aragon&lt;/a&gt;ese return to the top level after one year and being replaced by &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADctor%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt; after the 20th round in &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga\"&gt;the following season&lt;/a&gt;, which also ended with &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Spanish Cup win&lt;/a&gt;. After 11 second level games with &lt;a href=\"UD%20Almer%C3%ADa\"&gt;UD Almer\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;2004\u201305 campaign&lt;/a&gt;, he was in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Andalusia\"&gt;Andalusia&lt;/a&gt;ns for the full &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to the sixth position. \nFlores returned to the top flight in &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"Luis%20C%C3%A9sar%20Sampedro\"&gt;Luis C\u00e9sar Sampedro&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gimn%C3%A0stic%20de%20Tarragona\"&gt;Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona&lt;/a&gt; in late November 2006, following a 3\u20132 home loss against &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Mallorca\"&gt;RCD Mallorca&lt;/a&gt;. Even though he improved on his predecessor's numbers, it was not good enough to avoid relegation.\nHonours.\nEspanyol"
