    "text": "Sylvia Celeste Browne (\"&lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" Shoemaker; October 19, 1936\u00a0\u2013 November 20, 2013) was an American author who claimed to be a &lt;a href=\"Mediumship\"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"psychic\"&gt;psychic&lt;/a&gt; abilities. She appeared regularly on television and radio, including on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Montel%20Williams%20Show\"&gt;The Montel Williams Show&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Larry%20King%20Live\"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;\", and hosted an hour-long online radio show on &lt;a href=\"Hay%20House%20Radio\"&gt;Hay House Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrowne was frequently discredited and faced criticism for making pronouncements that were later found to be false, including those related to &lt;a href=\"missing%20persons\"&gt;missing persons&lt;/a&gt;. She was also a convicted criminal, having faced theft charges in 1992. Despite the considerable negative publicity, she maintained a large following until her death in 2013.\nEarly life.\nSylvia Browne grew up in &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of William Lee and Celeste (n\u00e9e Coil) Shoemaker. Her father held several different jobs, working at times in mail delivery, jewelry sales, and as a vice president of a major freight line. Browne was raised mostly as a &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, and was said to have an &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Episcopalian&lt;/a&gt; mother, a &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; maternal grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; father, and relatives from all these faiths.&lt;ref name=\"CNN0103/06\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBrowne claimed she started seeing visions at the age of five, and that her grandmother, who she claimed was also a &lt;a href=\"psychic\"&gt;psychic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mediumship\"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt;, helped her understand what they meant. Browne also claimed her great-uncle was a psychic medium and was \"rabid about &lt;a href=\"UFO\"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nCareer.\nBrowne started to give &lt;a href=\"psychic%20reading\"&gt;psychic reading&lt;/a&gt;s in 1974. In 1986, she founded a \"&lt;a href=\"Gnostic\"&gt;Gnostic&lt;/a&gt; Christian\" church in &lt;a href=\"Campbell%2C%20California\"&gt;Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Society of Novus Spiritus. She was also head of the Sylvia Browne Corporation and Sylvia Browne Enterprises. In a 2010 interview, Browne's business manager said that her businesses earned $3 million a year.\nBrowne claimed to have observed &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s. She also professed the ability to speak with a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20guide\"&gt;spirit guide&lt;/a&gt; named \"Francine\", and to perceive a wide range of \"vibrational frequencies\".\nBooks.\nBrowne authored some 40 books on &lt;a href=\"paranormal\"&gt;paranormal&lt;/a&gt; topics, some of which appeared on &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list\"&gt;\"The New York Times\" Best Seller list&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these books were acknowledged as resulting from collaborations with other writers such as Lindsay Harrison and Chris Dufresne.\nTelevision and radio.\nBrowne was a frequent guest on U.S. television and radio programs, including \"&lt;a href=\"Larry%20King%20Live\"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Montel%20Williams%20Show\"&gt;The Montel Williams Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"That%27s%20Incredible%21\"&gt;That's Incredible!&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Coast%20to%20Coast%20AM\"&gt;Coast to Coast AM&lt;/a&gt;\". During these appearances, she usually discussed her claimed abilities with the host and then performed readings for audience members or callers. On certain occasions she was paired with other guests, including &lt;a href=\"scientific%20skepticism\"&gt;skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, often leading to debate about the authenticity of Browne's psychic abilities. Browne hosted her own hour-long &lt;a href=\"Internet%20radio\"&gt;online radio&lt;/a&gt; show on &lt;a href=\"Hay%20House%20Radio\"&gt;Hay House Radio&lt;/a&gt;, where she performed readings and discussed paranormal issues.\nBrowne appeared in a 1991 episode of \"\". In the segment \"Ghosts R Us\", she portrayed herself in a recreation of events that purportedly took place in a haunted &lt;a href=\"Toys%20R%20Us\"&gt;Toys R Us&lt;/a&gt; store. Browne also appeared as herself on the &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; television &lt;a href=\"soap%20opera\"&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless\"&gt;The Young and the Restless&lt;/a&gt;\" in December 2006.\nFalse predictions.\nBrowne made many public pronouncements which were subsequently proven false. Among the more notable incidents were the following:\nPsychic detective cases.\nIn 2000, \"&lt;a href=\"Brill%27s%20Content\"&gt;Brill's Content&lt;/a&gt;\" examined ten recent \"Montel Williams\" episodes that highlighted Browne's work as a &lt;a href=\"psychic%20detective\"&gt;psychic detective&lt;/a&gt;, spanning 35 cases. In 21 cases, the information predicted by Browne was too vague to be verified. Of the remaining 14, law enforcement officials or family members stated Browne had played no useful role.\nIn 2010, the \"&lt;a href=\"Skeptical%20Inquirer\"&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" published a detailed three-year study by Ryan Shaffer and Agatha Jadwiszczok that examined Browne's predictions about &lt;a href=\"missing%20person\"&gt;missing person&lt;/a&gt;s and murder cases. Despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, the study reported that \"Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case.\" The study compared Browne's televised statements about 115 cases with newspaper reports and found that in the 25 cases where the actual outcome was known, she was completely wrong in every one. In the rest, where the final outcome was unknown, her predictions could not be substantiated. The study concluded that the media outlets that repeatedly promoted Browne's work had no visible concern about whether she was untrustworthy or harmed people.\nAmong the predictions examined in the study were the following:\nSago Mine disaster.\nOn January 2, 2006, &lt;a href=\"Sago%20Mine%20disaster\"&gt;an explosion at Sago mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; trapped several miners underground. The following day, Browne was a guest on the radio program \"Coast to Coast AM\" with &lt;a href=\"George%20Noory\"&gt;George Noory&lt;/a&gt;. At the start of the broadcast, it was believed that twelve of thirteen miners trapped by the disaster had been found alive and, when Noory asked Browne if the reported lack of noise from inside the mine might have led her to think the men had died, she replied, \"No; I knew they were going to be found.\" Later in the program, it was discovered that the earlier news reports had been in error; Browne said, \"I don't think there's anybody alive, maybe one\u00a0... I just don't think they are alive\", adding, subsequently, that she \"didn't believe that they were alive\u00a0... I did believe that they were gone.\"\nPopularity.\nBrowne cultivated a large following. In 2007, she had a four-year waiting list for readings by telephone. That same year, hundreds of people joined Browne on a &lt;a href=\"Cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruise&lt;/a&gt;, each paying thousands of dollars for psychic readings. Many of her books became staples on &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list\"&gt;\"The New York Times\" Best Seller list&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrowne attracted media attention seven years after her death, when social media users claimed that a prediction in her books (\"End of Days\" and \"Prophecy: What the Future Holds For You\") referred to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (she claimed \"a severe pneumonia-like illness\" would spread \"around\" 2020). News coverage of the alleged similarity appeared in March 2020, and was picked up by celebrities with large social media platforms such as &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Kardashian\"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;. Investigator &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Radford\"&gt;Benjamin Radford&lt;/a&gt; and others dismissed the one-paragraph prediction as too generic, and actually more akin to the 2003 &lt;a href=\"Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome\"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; epidemic, than to COVID-19. Radford said that as Browne had produced predictions by the thousands, \"the fact that this one happened to possibly, maybe, be partly right is meaningless.\"\nCriticism.\nBrowne was frequently condemned by skeptics. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20S.%20Lancaster\"&gt;Robert S. Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; maintained an exhaustive record of her inaccurate predictions and criminal activity, and described her pronouncements relating to missing children as \"incredibly offensive\". &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Ronson\"&gt;Jon Ronson&lt;/a&gt;, who called Browne \"America's most controversial psychic\", wrote that she was often \"psychically wrong\" and made \"a fortune saying very serious, cruel, show-stopping things to people in distress\". &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; noted that she was \"often criticized for her predictions\"; Browne also garnered disapproval from others who claim to be psychics.\nJohn Oliver.\nIn a 2019 segment of &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Week%20Tonight%20with%20John%20Oliver\"&gt;Last Week Tonight&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"John%20Oliver\"&gt;John Oliver&lt;/a&gt; criticized the media for promoting Browne and other psychics and enabling them to prey on grieving families. Oliver said, \"When psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.\"\nJames Randi.\nBrowne's most vocal critic within the &lt;a href=\"skeptical%20movement\"&gt;skeptical movement&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"James%20Randi\"&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt;, a retired &lt;a href=\"stage%20magician\"&gt;stage magician&lt;/a&gt; and investigator of paranormal claims; Randi claimed that Browne's accuracy rate was no better than educated guessing. On September 3, 2001, Browne stated on \"Larry King Live\" that she would prove her legitimacy by accepting the &lt;a href=\"James%20Randi%20Educational%20Foundation\"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"One%20Million%20Dollar%20Paranormal%20Challenge\"&gt;One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate supernatural abilities in a controlled scientific test. By April 2003, however, Browne had not contacted Randi to make testing arrangements.\nOn May 16, 2003, in another appearance on King's show, Browne said she had not taken the test because Randi refused to place the prize money in &lt;a href=\"escrow\"&gt;escrow&lt;/a&gt;. Randi responded by mailing a notarized copy of the prize account status showing a balance in excess of one million dollars; Browne refused to accept the letter. In late 2003, despite challenge rules that money could not be placed in escrow, Randi announced that he was willing to do so for Browne; she did not accept or acknowledge this offer. In 2005, Browne posted a message online that she had never received confirmation of the prize money's existence, despite Randi's claim that he had a certified mail receipt showing Browne's refusal of the package. In 2007, on CNN's \"&lt;a href=\"Anderson%20Cooper%20360%C2%B0\"&gt;Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0&lt;/a&gt;\", Browne's business manager Linda Rossi stated that Browne would not be taking Randi's challenge \"because she has nothing to prove to James Randi\".\nFraud conviction.\nDuring the late 1980s, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and local authorities began investigating Browne and her businesses over several bank loans that caused \"sustained losses\" to banks. In 1992, Browne and her then-husband Kenzil Dalzell Brown were indicted on several charges of &lt;a href=\"investment%20fraud\"&gt;investment fraud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grand%20theft\"&gt;grand theft&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Court%20of%20Santa%20Clara%20County\"&gt;Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California&lt;/a&gt;, found Browne and her husband had sold &lt;a href=\"securities\"&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt; in a gold-mining venture under false pretenses. In at least one instance, they told a couple that their $20,000 investment was to be used for immediate operating costs. Instead, the money was transferred to an account for their Nirvana Foundation for Psychic Research. Browne pleaded &lt;a href=\"nolo%20contendere\"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"securities%20fraud\"&gt;securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"indictment\"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"grand%20larceny\"&gt;grand larceny&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Clara County on May 26, 1992. The couple each received one year &lt;a href=\"probation\"&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Browne was sentenced to 200 hours of &lt;a href=\"community%20service\"&gt;community service&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nBrowne married four times. Her first marriage, from 1959 to 1972, was to Gary Dufresne. The couple had two sons, Paul and Christopher. She took the surname Brown upon her third marriage, and later changed it to Browne. Her fourth marriage took place on February 14, 2009, to Michael Ulery, the owner of a jewelry store.\nIn March 2011, the Society of Novus Spiritus, the Gnostic Christian Church founded by Browne, announced that she had suffered a &lt;a href=\"heart%20attack\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; on March 21 in &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, requesting donations on her behalf.\nDeath.\nBrowne died on November 20, 2013, aged 77, at Good Samaritan Hospital in &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%2C%20California\"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;. Her interment was at &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Hill%20Memorial%20Park\"&gt;Oak Hill Memorial Park&lt;/a&gt;."
