He was the first mayor of &lt;a href=\"Badalona\"&gt;Badalona&lt;/a&gt; elected after &lt;a href=\"1979%20Spanish%20local%20elections\"&gt;1979 Spanish local elections&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy\"&gt;Spanish transition to democracy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Barbastro\"&gt;Barbastro&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Huesca\"&gt;Huesca&lt;/a&gt;, Aragon) in 1933. He lived in Badalona, where he worked as company manager and entered to Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. He was elected as city councillor and mayor of Badalona in 1979. He served in office from 1979 to 1983, in coalition with the &lt;a href=\"Socialists%27%20Party%20of%20Catalonia\"&gt;Socialists\u2019 Party of Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; (PSC), with a government formed with &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt; and independent catholic-oriented politicians too.\nDuring his mandate, the names of the streets of Badalona were changed from Spanish to &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20language\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt;. He intended to open a provisional &lt;a href=\"Local%20programming\"&gt;local television&lt;/a&gt;, but was sealed by a court order, and the police arrested the mayor and other members of the local government who were protesting closed inside the provisional television building. A few hours later, they were set free.\nHe lost the next &lt;a href=\"1983%20Spanish%20local%20elections\"&gt;election in 1983&lt;/a&gt; because of the division created between eurocommunists and pro-Soviet factions of his party. After PSUC was merged with other parties in &lt;a href=\"Initiative%20for%20Catalonia%20Greens\"&gt;Initiative for Catalonia Greens&lt;/a&gt;, D\u00edaz attended with them to elections until 1995. He also served in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Catalonia\"&gt;Parliament of Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; between 1984 and 1988.\nHe was married to Teresa Lleal Galceran, a teacher, who died in 1988."
