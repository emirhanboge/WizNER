    "text": "The Judgement of Paris is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"William%20Congreve\"&gt;William Congreve&lt;/a&gt;. It was set by four British &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; composers \u2013 &lt;a href=\"John%20Weldon%20%28musician%29\"&gt;John Weldon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Eccles%20%28composer%29\"&gt;John Eccles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Purcell\"&gt;Daniel Purcell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Finger\"&gt;Gottfried Finger&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 as part of a music competition held in 1700-1701. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Arne\"&gt;Thomas Arne&lt;/a&gt; later composed a score to the libretto in 1742.\nSynopsis.\nSetting: &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ida%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Mount Ida&lt;/a&gt;\nThe god Mercury descends from the sky with the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20of%20Discord\"&gt;golden apple of Discord&lt;/a&gt; and asks the shepherd Paris to award it to whichever of the three goddesses \u2013 Juno, Pallas and Venus \u2013 he finds most worthy. Juno offers him worldly power, Pallas victory in war, and Venus the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris gives the golden apple to Venus.\nThe \"Musick Prize\".\nA group of English nobles headed by Lord Halifax had become interested in promoting all-sung English opera (most English operas of the day took the form of &lt;a href=\"semi-opera\"&gt;semi-opera&lt;/a&gt;s mixing music and spoken drama). In an announcement in the \"London Gazette\" of 18 March 1700 they offered a \"Musick Prize\" for the best setting of Congreve's short libretto. First prize was 100 guineas, second 50, third 30, and fourth 20.\nFour composers entered the competition: &lt;a href=\"John_Weldon_%28musician%29\"&gt;John Weldon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John_Eccles_%28composer%29\"&gt;John Eccles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Purcell\"&gt;Daniel Purcell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Finger\"&gt;Gottfried Finger&lt;/a&gt;. Their works were performed individually during the spring of 1701, then staged together in a grand final at the &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20Garden%20Theatre\"&gt;Dorset Garden Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on 3 June 1703. The audience judged the winner. Eccles had been expected to win but in the event he came second to Weldon with Daniel Purcell third and Finger fourth. The competition had little long-term success in promoting all-sung opera in English. The London stage would soon be dominated by Italian opera and both Eccles and Daniel Purcell gave up writing theatre music.\nThe competition was re-staged in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 1989 &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Proms\"&gt;BBC Proms&lt;/a&gt; season. &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Rooley\"&gt;Anthony Rooley&lt;/a&gt; conducted the Consorte of Musicke and Concerto K\u00f6ln in performances of the three surviving scores (Finger's has been lost). Once again, the audience decided the winner and this time they awarded first prize to Eccles.\nArne's version.\nThomas Arne set \"The Judgement of Paris\" as part of a revival of interest in libretti by Congreve in the 1740s (&lt;a href=\"George%20Frideric%20Handel\"&gt;Handel&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Semele%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Semele&lt;/a&gt;\" would appear in 1744). Arne's version was first performed at Drury Lane Theatre on 12 March 1742, with the composer's wife &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Young\"&gt;Cecilia Young&lt;/a&gt; in the role of Venus. Arne staged the work as a companion piece to his masque \"&lt;a href=\"Alfred%20%28Arne%20opera%29\"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;\" in June of the same year in Dublin. The Arne version was performed by &lt;a href=\"Bampton%20Classical%20Opera\"&gt;Bampton Classical Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 and 2016."
