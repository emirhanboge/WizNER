It is immediately superior to the &lt;a href=\"Rear%20admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt; rank and is subordinate to the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;full admiral&lt;/a&gt; rank. Naval personnel could be advanced to the rank of vice-admiral, normally from rear-admiral, whilst on active service, on the Reserved List (liable to be recalled to duty at short notice) or on the Retired List\nThe Royal Navy has had vice admirals since at least the 16th century. When the fleet was deployed, the vice admiral would be in the leading portion or &lt;a href=\"Vanguard\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;, acting as the deputy to the admiral."
