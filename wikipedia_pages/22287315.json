    "text": "Maarten Gerritszoon Vries, or Fries, also referred to as de Vries, (18 February 1589, &lt;a href=\"Harlingen%2C%20Friesland\"&gt;Harlingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 late 1647, at sea near &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;) was a 17th-century Dutch &lt;a href=\"cartographer\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt; and explorer, the first Western European to leave an account of his visit to &lt;a href=\"Ezo\"&gt;Ezo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sakhalin\"&gt;Sakhalin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuril%20Islands\"&gt;Kuril Islands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Okhotsk\"&gt;Sea of Okhotsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot much is known about the life of de Vries. He was probably born in &lt;a href=\"Harlingen%2C%20Netherlands\"&gt;Harlingen, Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, in 1589 and spent many years in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. He is best remembered for his 1643 expedition to the north-western &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; to discover the coast of &lt;a href=\"Tartaria\"&gt;Tartaria&lt;/a&gt;, on account of &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20van%20Diemen\"&gt;Anthony van Diemen&lt;/a&gt;, the governor in &lt;a href=\"Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Batavia&lt;/a&gt;. This was the second expedition to look for legendary gold and silver islands in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, which nobody had discovered, after a failed expedition in 1639 under command of &lt;a href=\"Matthijs%20Quast\"&gt;Matthijs Quast&lt;/a&gt;.\nDe Vries expedition.\nThe two ships, the \"&lt;a href=\"Castricum\"&gt;Castricum&lt;/a&gt;\" under De Vries and the \"&lt;a href=\"Breskens\"&gt;Breskens&lt;/a&gt;\" under &lt;a href=\"Hendrick%20Cornelisz%20Schaep\"&gt;Hendrick Cornelisz Schaep&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Batavia&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Dutch &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, in February 1643. After a stop in &lt;a href=\"Ternate\"&gt;Ternate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moluccas\"&gt;Moluccas&lt;/a&gt; they continued their journey on April 4. On May 20 the two ships lost touch with each other in a storm, while off &lt;a href=\"Hachij%C5%8D-jima\"&gt;Hachijo Shima&lt;/a&gt;, an island some 290\u00a0km south of &lt;a href=\"Edo\"&gt;Edo&lt;/a&gt;, which, due to this setback, was christened \"Ongeluckich\", or \"Unlucky\", Island by the Dutch.\n\"Breskens\" in Yamada.\nThe \"Breskens\" arrived in a promising bay and was received friendly by the population of &lt;a href=\"Yamada%2C%20Iwate\"&gt;Yamada&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tohoku\"&gt;Tohoku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Six weeks later the \"Breskens\" again sailed to Yamada, probably while they had a good time. In the evening they organized a party with a &lt;a href=\"samurai\"&gt;samurai&lt;/a&gt; and most probably some Japanese women. (It is not known what exactly happened, because the diary got lost in 1692, after &lt;a href=\"Nicolaes%20Witsen\"&gt;Nicolaes Witsen&lt;/a&gt; received it.) The next day, July 29, ten members of the crew, including the captain were invited by the women to come to a farm where they would receive fresh vegetables and fish. The unarmed crew was offered &lt;a href=\"sake\"&gt;sake&lt;/a&gt; and rice, but captured, and sent to &lt;a href=\"Morioka\"&gt;Morioka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edo\"&gt;Edo&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"interrogation\"&gt;interrogation&lt;/a&gt;. The Japanese feared Portuguese / Spanish &lt;a href=\"Jesuits\"&gt;Jesuits&lt;/a&gt; had come to land. As a result, &lt;a href=\"bakufu\"&gt;bakufu&lt;/a&gt; officials were extremely anxious about the problem of coastal defenses. However, after it was understood that the crew were Dutch &lt;a href=\"merchants\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; and not Catholics, the problem to be solved became one of deciding by which procedure the Dutch should be released. After &lt;a href=\"Jan%20van%20Elserac\"&gt;Jan van Elserac&lt;/a&gt; had arrived the \"&lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Dgun\"&gt;sh\u014dgun&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20Iemitsu\"&gt;Tokugawa Iemitsu&lt;/a&gt; sent them in December to &lt;a href=\"Deshima\"&gt;Deshima&lt;/a&gt;. The crew had to wait nine months for the next ship to &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; while the \"Breskens\" had left Honshu already at the end of July (without a captain) searching for the Gold and Silver Islands.\n\"Castricum\" going north.\nIn the summer of 1643, the \"Castricum\" sailed by the southern &lt;a href=\"Kuril%20Islands\"&gt;Kuril Islands&lt;/a&gt;, visiting &lt;a href=\"Kunashir\"&gt;Kunashir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iturup\"&gt;Iturup&lt;/a&gt; (which they named \"Staten Island\", although nowadays this name is only used to refer to &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island\"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Urup\"&gt;Urup&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with the &lt;a href=\"Ainu%20people\"&gt;Ainu&lt;/a&gt;, and which they named \"Company Island\" and claimed for the Netherlands.\nThe \"Castricum\" passed between the islands of Iturup and Urup, the strait between the islands being later named &lt;a href=\"Vries%20Strait\"&gt;Vries Strait&lt;/a&gt; after its discoverer, and entered the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Okhotsk\"&gt;Sea of Okhotsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dutch sailed north, without encountering any land, until being driven south-west toward the northern shores of &lt;a href=\"Hokkaido\"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt;. Then they sailed north again, discovering &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Aniva\"&gt;Cape Aniva&lt;/a&gt; (the southeastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Sakhalin%20Island\"&gt;Sakhalin Island&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Patience\"&gt;Gulf of Patience&lt;/a&gt; (where they indeed had to be patient, waiting for the fog to clear), and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Patience\"&gt;Cape Patience&lt;/a&gt; east of it.\nAfter another excursion, now east into the Pacific, the \"Castricum\" returned to Japanese waters and managed to meet with the \"Breskens\" off &lt;a href=\"Kyushu\"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt;. The two ships sailed to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zeelandia%20%28Taiwan%29\"&gt;Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Batavia in mid-December 1643.\nBattles of La Naval de Manila.\nMaarten Gerritsz Vries died on board from disease after leading an &lt;a href=\"Battles%20of%20La%20Naval%20de%20Manila\"&gt;unsuccessful attempt&lt;/a&gt; to invade the Philippines."
