    "text": "\"Rumpelstiltskin\" ( ; ) is a German &lt;a href=\"fairy%20tale\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;/a&gt;. It was collected by the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20Grimm\"&gt;Brothers Grimm&lt;/a&gt; in the 1812 edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20and%20Household%20Tales\"&gt;Children's and Household Tales&lt;/a&gt;\". The story is about an &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; who spins &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a girl's &lt;a href=\"firstborn\"&gt;firstborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nIn order to appear superior, a &lt;a href=\"miller\"&gt;miller&lt;/a&gt; lies to the king, telling him that his daughter can &lt;a href=\"Spinning%20%28textiles%29\"&gt;spin&lt;/a&gt; straw into &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. The king calls for the girl, locks her up in a tower room filled with straw and a &lt;a href=\"spinning%20wheel\"&gt;spinning wheel&lt;/a&gt;, and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will cut off her head. When she has given up all hope, an &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;-like creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace (since he only comes to people who are seeking a deal or a trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the &lt;a href=\"Rule%20of%20three%20%28writing%29\"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which she can pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her &lt;a href=\"firstborn\"&gt;firstborn&lt;/a&gt; child, and so he spins the straw into gold a final time.\nThe king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: \"Now give me what you promised.\" She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. He finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days.\nThe queen's many guesses fail. But before the final night, she wanders into the woods searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics\u2014\"tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name\"\u2014he reveals his name.\nWhen the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper at the loss of their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then \"ran away angrily, and never came back.\" The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin \"in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two.\" Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.\nHistory.\nAccording to researchers at &lt;a href=\"Durham%20University\"&gt;Durham University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NOVA%20University%20Lisbon\"&gt;NOVA University Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, the origins of the story can be traced back to around 4,000 years ago.. A possible early literary reference to the tale appears in Dio of Halicarnassus' 'Roman Antiquities', in the 1st century CE \nVariants.\nThe same story pattern appears in numerous other cultures: \"Tom Tit Tot\" in &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (from \"English Fairy Tales\", 1890, by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Jacobs\"&gt;Joseph Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;); \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.sacred-texts.com/neu/yeats/fip/fip72.htm\"&gt;The Lazy Beauty and her Aunts&lt;/a&gt;\" in Ireland (from \"\", 1870 by &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Kennedy%20%28folklorist%29\"&gt;Patrick Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;); \"&lt;a href=\"Whuppity%20Stoorie\"&gt;Whuppity Stoorie&lt;/a&gt;\" in Scotland (from &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Robert Chambers&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Popular Rhymes of Scotland\", 1826); \"Gilitrutt\" in Iceland; \u062c\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0646 (\"Joaidane\" \"He who talks too much\") in Arabic; \u0425\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 (\"Khlamushka\" \"Junker\") in Russia; \"Rumplcimprcampr\", \"Rampeln\u00edk\" or \"Martin Zvonek\" in the Czech Republic; \"Martinko Kling\u00e1\u010d\" in Slovakia; \"Cvilidreta\" in Croatia; \"Ruidoquedito\" (\"Little noise\") in South America; \"Pancimanci\" in Hungary (from 1862 folktale collection by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Arany); \"Daiku to Oniroku\" (\u5927\u5de5\u3068\u9b3c\u516d \"The carpenter and the ogre\") in Japan and \"Myrmidon\" in France. \nAn earlier literary variant in &lt;a href=\"France%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; was penned by &lt;a href=\"Marie-Jeanne%20L%27H%C3%A9ritier%20de%20Villandon\"&gt;Mme. L'H\u00e9ritier&lt;/a&gt;, titled \"Ricdin-Ricdon\". A version of it exists in the compilation \"Le Cabinet des F\u00e9es\", Vol. XII. pp. 125-131.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20people\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt; tale of &lt;a href=\"Duffy%20and%20the%20Devil\"&gt;Duffy and the Devil&lt;/a&gt; plays out an essentially similar plot featuring a \"devil\" named \"Terry-top\".\nAll these tales are classified in the &lt;a href=\"Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson%E2%80%93Uther%20Index\"&gt;Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther Index&lt;/a&gt; as tale type ATU 500, \"The Name of the Helper\". According to scholarship, it is popular in \"Denmark, Finland, Germany and Ireland\".\nName.\nThe name \"Rumpelstilzchen\" in &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; (IPA: ) means literally \"little rattle stilt\", a \"stilt\" being a post or pole that provides support for a structure. A \"rumpelstilt\" or \"rumpelstilz\" was consequently the name of a type of goblin, also called a \"pophart\" or \"poppart\", that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to \"rumpelgeist\" (\"rattle ghost\") or \"&lt;a href=\"poltergeist\"&gt;poltergeist&lt;/a&gt;\", a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are \"mummarts\" or \"&lt;a href=\"boggart\"&gt;boggart&lt;/a&gt;s\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Hob%20%28folklore%29\"&gt;hobs&lt;/a&gt;\", which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.) The ending \"-chen\" is a German diminutive cognate to English \"-kin\".\nThe name is believed to be derived from &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Fischart\"&gt;Johann Fischart&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua\" of 1577 (a loose adaptation of &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais\"&gt;Rabelais'&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Gargantua%20and%20Pantagruel\"&gt;Gargantua and Pantagruel&lt;/a&gt;\"), which refers to an \"amusement\" for children, i.e., a children's game named \"Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart\".\nTranslations.\nTranslations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3ARumpelstiltskin\"&gt;Rumpelstilzchen&lt;/a&gt;\". For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: \"Rumpelstiltskin\" or \"Rumplestiltskin\" in English, \"Repelsteeltje\" in &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, \"Rumpelstichen\" in Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, \"Rumpelstinski\", \"Rumpelest\u00edjeles\", \"Trasgolisto\", \"Jasil el Trasgu\", \"Barabay\", \"Rompelimbr\u00e1\", \"Barrab\u00e1s\", \"Ruidoquedito\", \"Rompeltisquillo\", \"Tiribilit\u00edn\", \"Tremol\u00edn\", \"El enano saltar\u00edn\" y \"el duende saltar\u00edn\" in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, \"Rumplcimprcampr\" or \"Rampeln\u00edk\" in &lt;a href=\"Czech%20language\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, it is called \u30eb\u30f3\u30da\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30a3\u30eb\u30c4\u30ad\u30f3 (\"Runperushutirutsukin\"). &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; might have the most accomplished imitation of the German name with \u0420\u0443\u043c\u043f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0445\u0435\u043d (\"Rumpel\u02b9\u0161t\u00edl\u02b9cxen\").\nIn other languages, the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way. Thus \"Rumpelstilzchen\" is known as \"P\u00e4ronskaft\" (literally \"Pear-stalk\") in &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;, where the sense of \"stilt\" or \"stalk\" of the second part is retained. \n&lt;a href=\"Slovak%20language\"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; translations use \"Martinko Kling\u00e1\u010d\". &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; translations use \"Titelitury\" (or \"Rumpelsztyk\") and &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20language\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; ones \"Tittelintuure\", \"Rompanruoja\" or \"Hopskukkeli\". The &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; name is T\u0171zman\u00f3cska and in &lt;a href=\"Serbo-Croatian\"&gt;Serbo-Croatian&lt;/a&gt; \"Cvilidreta\" (\"Whine-screamer\"). The &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20language\"&gt;Slovenian&lt;/a&gt; translation uses \"\u0160picparkeljc\" (pointy-hoof). For &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; the poet &lt;a href=\"Avraham%20Shlonsky\"&gt;Avraham Shlonsky&lt;/a&gt; composed the name (\"Ootz-li Gootz-li\", a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, \"My adviser my midget\"), when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children's &lt;a href=\"musical%20theatre\"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt;, now a classic among Hebrew children's plays. &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; translations have used \u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bb\u03c4\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd (from the English) or \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 (\"Koutsokaliy\u00e9ris\"), which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle \u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf- (\"ko\u00fatso-\" \"limping\"), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name. In &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, the creature is usually called \"Tremotino\", which is probably formed from the world \"tremoto\", which means \"earthquake\" in &lt;a href=\"Tuscan%20dialect\"&gt;Tuscan dialect&lt;/a&gt;, and the suffix \"-ino\", which generally indicates a small and/or sly character. The first Italian edition of the fables was published in 1897, and the books in those years were all written in Tuscan. &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; versions of the tale used the name \"Tees Mar Khan\" for the imp.\nRumpelstiltskin principle.\nThe value and power of using personal names and titles is well established in psychology, management, teaching and trial law. It is often referred to as the \"Rumpelstiltskin principle\"."
