On 23 March 1741, Lady Keliyete gave birth to the emperor's fifth son, &lt;a href=\"Yongqi%2C%20Prince%20Rong\"&gt;Yongqi&lt;/a&gt;. She was elevated in December 1741 or January 1742 to \"Concubine Yu\", and on 9 December 1745 to \"Consort Yu\".\nYongqi became the Qianlong Emperor's favourite son because of his diligence and proficiency in various arts.

In 1793, the emperor granted her the posthumous title \"Noble Consort Yu\" and had her interred in the Yu Mausoleum of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Qing%20tombs\"&gt;Eastern Qing tombs&lt;/a&gt;."
