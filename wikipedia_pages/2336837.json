She formerly played for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Silver%20Stars\"&gt;San Antonio Stars&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;WNBA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Waves%20%28Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20League%29\"&gt;Perth Lynx&lt;/a&gt; in Australia's &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20League\"&gt;WNBL&lt;/a&gt;. The 5'7\" Bevilaqua's play style is energetic and disruptive, so much so that she is usually in the top 10 in &lt;a href=\"steal%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt;s. In the 2005 regular season, she had more steals per turnover than any other player.\nWNBA career.\nBevilaqua was never &lt;a href=\"WNBA%20Draft\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; by a WNBA team.\nShe was signed by the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Rockers\"&gt;Cleveland Rockers&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; before the 1998 season began, but played only 12 regular-season games for them before being waived by the team in July 1998.\nIn 2000, she signed a free agent contract with the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Fire\"&gt;Portland Fire&lt;/a&gt; and played with them for three seasons until the franchise folded after the 2002 season.\nIn 2003, she signed another contract with the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Storm\"&gt;Seattle Storm&lt;/a&gt;, and played two seasons for them, capping the 2004 season when the Storm won the &lt;a href=\"WNBA%20Finals\"&gt;WNBA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Sun\"&gt;Connecticut Sun&lt;/a&gt;, two games to one.\nIn 2005, she signed with the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Fever\"&gt;Indiana Fever&lt;/a&gt;, and led them to a #2 seed in the playoffs, where they swept the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Liberty\"&gt;New York Liberty&lt;/a&gt; in two games, but in turn were swept by the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Sun\"&gt;Connecticut Sun&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nDespite Bevilaqua's WNBA success, she failed to make the Australian national team until 2006 at the age of 34, when she helped lead the Opals to the gold medal in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIBA%20World%20Championship%20for%20Women\"&gt;2006 FIBA World Championship for Women&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 27 August 2007, Bevilaqua played a key scoring, defensive, and leadership role in the greatest comeback in WNBA history when the Indiana Fever overcame a 22-point first half deficit to win the deciding game three of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals against the Connecticut Sun. Later that week on 31 August 2007 Tully was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Perrot%20Sportsmanship%20Award\"&gt;Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award&lt;/a&gt; from the WNBA.\nBevilaqua is one of only four WNBA players to record at least 800 career assists and 500 career steals.\n2004 Championship season.\nOne of the highlights of Bevilaqua's career was her participation on the 2004 &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Storm\"&gt;Seattle Storm&lt;/a&gt; championship team. In the championship series, the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Sun\"&gt;Connecticut Sun&lt;/a&gt; won the first game of a three-game series. Then, before sold-out crowds at Seattle's KeyArena, Bevilaqua and the Storm won the second and third games to take the crown as champion. Bevilaqua's role in the series was backup point guard to Sue Bird and Betty Lennox, but she contributed in every phase of the game\u2014scoring, rebounding, and playing the tenacious defense that has become her trademark on the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Fever\"&gt;Indiana Fever&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough listed as a backup guard, in the course of the Storm's 2004 championship run Bevilaqua played unusually long minutes. This was most evident in the second game against the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Lynx\"&gt;Minnesota Lynx&lt;/a&gt;. Sue Bird was injured early in the game, and WNBA Finals MVP Betty Lennox quickly got into foul trouble. Storm coach Anne Donovan sent Bevilaqua in to run the offense, and she played 27 minutes to carry the team to victory. The Seattle crowd chanted her name repeatedly during the game.\nPersonal life.\nBevilaqua was born in &lt;a href=\"Merredin%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Merredin, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. She played &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; as a youth.\nHer hobbies include: &lt;a href=\"karaoke\"&gt;karaoke singing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, and reading &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Cornwell\"&gt;Patricia Cornwell&lt;/a&gt;'s novels.\nBevilaqua's height is listed at 5'7\" (about 170\u00a0cm) in the WNBA but only 164\u00a0cm (about 5'4.5\") in the WNBL.\nBevilaqua wrote a regular column in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Canberra%20Times\"&gt;The Canberra Times&lt;/a&gt;\" on the progress of the Canberra Capitals during the 2006/07 WNBL season.\nBevilaqua helped launch women specific &lt;a href=\"Nfinity\"&gt;Nfinity&lt;/a&gt; Basketball Shoes in 2009\nIn 2013, Bevilaqua married her partner Lindsay, with the union becoming official with Indiana's recognition of same-sex marriage in October 2014. Tully and Lindsay have two children. Parker and Mackenzie."
