In 36 games, Wilson had eight goals and 32 points and in six playoff games, he had two goals and seven points, as HC Davos finished in fourth place.\nAfter the season, Wilson announced his retirement as a player.\nCoaching career.\nMilwaukee Admirals (1989\u20131990).\nWilson joined the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Admirals\"&gt;Milwaukee Admirals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Hockey%20League%20%281945%E2%80%932001%29\"&gt;International Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (IHL) as an assistant coach, working under Head Coach &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Lapointe\"&gt;Ron Lapointe&lt;/a&gt;. In his only season with the Admirals, the club finished with a 36\u201339\u20137 record, finishing in third place in the West Division. In the playoffs, the Admirals lost to the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20Golden%20Eagles\"&gt;Salt Lake Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt; in the first round.\nVancouver Canucks (1990\u20131993).\nWilson joined the &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Canucks\"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt; coaching staff as an assistant coach under &lt;a href=\"Bob%20McCammon\"&gt;Bob McCammon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1990\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;. After the Canucks struggled to a 19\u201330\u20135 record, the club fired McCammon and replaced him with &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Quinn%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;Pat Quinn&lt;/a&gt;. Wilson remained as an assistant, and under Quinn, the Canucks went 9\u201313\u20134 to sneak into the fourth and final playoff spot in the &lt;a href=\"Smythe%20Division\"&gt;Smythe Division&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1991%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;1991 post-season&lt;/a&gt;, the Canucks lost to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Kings\"&gt;Los Angeles Kings&lt;/a&gt; in six games in the first round.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1991\u201392&lt;/a&gt;, Vancouver improved their point total by 31 points, as the team finished the year with a 42\u201326\u201312 record, finishing in first place in the Smythe Division. The heavily favoured Canucks managed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%931996%29\"&gt;Winnipeg Jets&lt;/a&gt; in seven games before falling to the &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20Oilers\"&gt;Edmonton Oilers&lt;/a&gt; in six games in the Smythe Division Finals.\nVancouver improved their point total once again in &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1992\u201393&lt;/a&gt;, going 46\u201329\u20139, earning 101 points and their second consecutive Smythe Division title. In the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;1993 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Canucks defeated the Winnipeg Jets in the first round before losing to the Los Angeles Kings in the division finals.\nAfter the season, Wilson left the Canucks and became the first head coach of the expansion team &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Ducks%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Mighty Ducks of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim (1993\u20131997).\nWilson became the first head coach of the &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Ducks%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Mighty Ducks of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1993\u201394 season&lt;/a&gt;. On October 8, 1993, his first game as an NHL head coach, Wilson and the Mighty Ducks lost to the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Red%20Wings\"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt;, 7\u20132. He won his first game on October 13, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20Oilers\"&gt;Edmonton Oilers&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20133. The team finished the season with 33\u201346\u20135 record for 71 points, falling short of the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;1993 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mighty Ducks continued to struggle in the following season, &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt;, finishing 16\u201327\u20135 in the &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout\"&gt;lockout&lt;/a&gt;-shortened season to post the poorest record in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Western Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnaheim made a big improvement in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, however, as the club went 35\u201339\u20138 record (78 points). Nonetheless, Wilson and the Mighty Ducks' efforts came just shy of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;1996 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, finishing one spot out of post-season contention, ninth, in the Conference. Despite accumulating the same point total as the eighth-placed &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%931996%29\"&gt;Winnipeg Jets&lt;/a&gt;, they lost the tie-breaker separating the two, as they finished with one fewer win.\nThe Mighty Ducks continued their improvement in &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1996\u201397 season&lt;/a&gt;, finishing with their first-ever winning record, 36\u201333\u201313, and qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;Stanley Cup playoffs&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in team history. In the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;post-season&lt;/a&gt;, Anaheim defeated the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Coyotes\"&gt;Phoenix Coyotes&lt;/a&gt; in seven games before being swept by the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Red%20Wings\"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. Despite team improvement, on May 20, 1997, the Mighty Ducks fired Wilson.\nWashington Capitals (1997\u20132002).\nOn June 9, 1997, the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Capitals\"&gt;Washington Capitals&lt;/a&gt; hired Wilson to become the head coach of the team, replacing &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Schoenfeld\"&gt;Jim Schoenfeld&lt;/a&gt; after the club failed to reach the playoffs in 1996\u201397.\nIn his first season with the Capitals, Wilson led the team to a 40\u201330\u201312 record, a 17-point improvement over the previous season's total, as Washington qualified for the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;1998 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;. In the post-season, the fourth-seeded Capitals defeated the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Bruins\"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt; in the first round, then the &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20Senators\"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Sabres\"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals\"&gt;1998 Stanley Cup Finals&lt;/a&gt;, the first time the team reached the Finals in their 24 years of existence. In the Finals, however, the Capitals were swept in four games by the Detroit Red Wings, who won their second consecutive &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Cup\"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nWashington regressed in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1998\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt;, going 31\u201345\u20136 record and finishing 12th in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Eastern Conference&lt;/a&gt;, well out of a playoff spot.\nThe Capitals, however, rebounded in &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1999\u20132000&lt;/a&gt;, as they won the &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Division%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Southeast Division&lt;/a&gt; with a 44\u201324\u201312\u20132 record and finished in second place in the East. In the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2000 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Capitals were upset by the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Penguins\"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; in five games in the first round.\nThe Capitals won their second consecutive Southeast Division title in &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt;, going 41\u201327\u201310\u20134 and earning 96 points, solid enough for a third-place finish in the Eastern Conference. In the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2001 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Capitals were once again upset by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who won the series in six games.\nIn the summer of 2001, the Capitals acquired superstar &lt;a href=\"Jarom%C3%ADr%20J%C3%A1gr\"&gt;Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr&lt;/a&gt; from the Penguins and were thought to be a Stanley Cup contender for &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the high-profile acquisition, the club struggled for much of the season, posting a 36\u201333\u201311\u20132 record and finishing in ninth place in the East, out of the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2002 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;. On May 10, 2002, the Capitals fired Wilson after their disappointing season.\nSan Jose Sharks (2002\u20132008).\nOn December 4, 2002, Wilson was hired by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Sharks\"&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently fired &lt;a href=\"Darryl%20Sutter\"&gt;Darryl Sutter&lt;/a&gt; and had a 9\u201312\u20132\u20132 record at the time Wilson was hired. Under Wilson, the Sharks continued to struggle, however, going 19\u201325\u20137\u20136 and failing to make the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2003 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his first full season with San Jose, (2003\u201304), Wilson turned around the team, leading them to a 43\u201321\u201312\u20136 record for 104 points, a first-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Division%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Pacific Division&lt;/a&gt; and a second-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Western Conference&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2004 Stanley Cup playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Sharks defeated the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Blues\"&gt;St. Louis Blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Avalanche\"&gt;Colorado Avalanche&lt;/a&gt; to advance to the Western Conference Finals. Despite being favored to win the series, the &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20Flames\"&gt;Calgary Flames&lt;/a&gt;, buoyed by the play of newly acquired goaltender \u2014 and former Shark \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Miikka%20Kiprusoff\"&gt;Miikka Kiprusoff&lt;/a&gt;, upset San Jose in six games.\nWilson remained with the Sharks during the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2004\u201305 season&lt;/a&gt;, which was cancelled due to the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout\"&gt;2004\u201305 NHL lockout&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sharks remained a top team in &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt; when play resumed, as the club went 44\u201327\u201311 for 99 points. In mid-season, the Sharks were involved in a trade that brought &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Thornton\"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; to the club from the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Bruins\"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2006 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Sharks defeated the &lt;a href=\"Nashville%20Predators\"&gt;Nashville Predators&lt;/a&gt; in the first round before falling to the eighth-seeded &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20Oilers\"&gt;Edmonton Oilers&lt;/a&gt; in the second round.\nSan Jose continued to improve in &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt;, as the team won 50 games for the first time in club history, going 51\u201326\u20135 for 107 points and clinching another playoff berth. In the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2007 post-season&lt;/a&gt;, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators for the second-straight season, but lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the second round. With his team's loss to the Red Wings, Wilson became the first head coach in NHL history to lose to the same team while coaching three different teams (including Anaheim in 1997 and Washington in 1998).\nThe Sharks improved their point total again in &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt;, as they went 49\u201323\u201310, earning 108 points and having the best record in the Pacific Division and claiming the second seed in the Western Conference. In the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2008 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Sharks narrowly defeated the Calgary Flames in seven games before losing to the underdog &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Stars\"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; in six games in the second round. On May 12, 2008, the Sharks fired Wilson, as the club failed to meet management's playoff aspirations.\nToronto Maple Leafs (2008\u20132012).\nOn June 10, 2008, the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs\"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; hired Wilson to become the team's head coach, replacing &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Maurice\"&gt;Paul Maurice&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his hiring, Toronto had not made the playoffs since &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2003\u201304&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Wilson's first year with the Leafs, &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt;, the club went 34\u201335\u201313, earning 81 points for last place in the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Division%20%28NHL%29\"&gt;Northeast Division&lt;/a&gt; and 12th in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Maple Leafs continued to struggle in &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt;, finishing with a 30\u201338\u201314 record, earning 74 points and a last place finish in the Eastern Conference. Before season's end, the Maple Leafs traded away their two first-round draft picks \u2014 and a second-rounder \u2014 to the Boston Bruins in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Kessel\"&gt;Phil Kessel&lt;/a&gt;, also adding defenseman &lt;a href=\"Dion%20Phaneuf\"&gt;Dion Phaneuf&lt;/a&gt; from the Calgary Flames to the club midway through the season.\nToronto saw some improvement in &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt;, as the Leafs finished with an above-.500 record under Wilson for the first time, going 37\u201334\u201311 (85 points). Despite the improvement, the club failed to reach the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;2011 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in tenth place in the East.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt;, the final year of Wilson's contract, the Maple Leafs shot off to a solid start to begin the season. On December 26, 2011, the team had an 18\u201313\u20134 record and were sitting in a playoff position. Maple Leafs General Manager &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Burke%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;Brian Burke&lt;/a&gt; then signed Wilson to a contract extension. Shortly after the contract extension, however, the Maple Leafs began to slump, as they would go 11\u201315\u20133 in their next 29 games to fall out of playoff contention. On March 2, 2012, the Maple Leafs fired Wilson, replacing him with &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Carlyle\"&gt;Randy Carlyle&lt;/a&gt;, who had himself just recently been fired as head coach by the &lt;a href=\"Anaheim%20Ducks\"&gt;Anaheim Ducks&lt;/a&gt;. Toronto had a 29\u201328\u20137 record at the time of Wilson's termination.\nInternational career.\nWilson first coached internationally at the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships\"&gt;1996 IIHF World Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where he guided the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to a bronze medal, the country's first medal at the tournament in 34 years. Later that year, he was named the team's coach at the &lt;a href=\"1996%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey\"&gt;1996 World Cup of Hockey&lt;/a&gt;, where he led the Americans to the tournament championship.\nFollowing this success, Wilson again coached the Americans at the 1998 Winter Olympics in &lt;a href=\"Nagano%20%28city%29\"&gt;Nagano&lt;/a&gt;, where they went a disappointing 1\u20133, defeating only &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; and being eliminated by the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals.\nIn April 2009, Wilson was named the head coach for the U.S. Olympic hockey team for the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament\"&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;. The team went undefeated through round robin play and advanced through the knockout stages, eventually losing to the hosts &lt;a href=\"Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in the final in overtime; the team won the silver medal.\nOn June 4, 2015, &lt;a href=\"USA%20Hockey\"&gt;USA Hockey&lt;/a&gt; announced that Wilson would be the head coach for the men's under-20 team at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships\"&gt;2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships&lt;/a&gt; in Helsinki, Finland.\nCoaching style.\nAs a coach, Wilson is well known for integrating technology into his coaching plans. During his stint with the Washington Capitals, he and assistant coach &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Hunter%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;Tim Hunter&lt;/a&gt; introduced personal computers into the team's strategy planning and burned DVDs of Capitals games for the team to review. In his stint with the San Jose Sharks, Wilson introduced a &lt;a href=\"tablet%20computer\"&gt;tablet computer&lt;/a&gt; to be used in the team bench by himself or his assistants to instantly plan out strategies and review plays.\nBroadcasting career.\nIn early 2015, Wilson joined the &lt;a href=\"TSN%20Hockey\"&gt;TSN Hockey&lt;/a&gt; panel as an analyst."
