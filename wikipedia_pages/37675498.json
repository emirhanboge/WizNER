    "text": "Bloodlust is a 1992 Australian &lt;a href=\"vampire%20film\"&gt;vampire film&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Hewitt\"&gt;Jon Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Wolstencroft and starring Big Bad Ralph and Kelly Chapman.\nPremise.\nIn the streets of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, three vampires wander around killing, having sex and taking drugs. They carry out a heist, which involves stealing $3 million which attracts the attention of many psychotics, who chase them through a blood spattered odyssey into the Melbourne underground.\nProduction.\nCo-director Jon Hewitt described it as:\nA purpose-made, market-driven, crass, exploitation film. It isn't particularly good but, for me, it was really my film school. It's where I taught myself how to make a feature film and made a lot of mistakes on it - but I tried to learn from them. It was a film made in the context of not really being able to get any support for anything I was trying to do, then just going out and making something that I thought would have a back-end market, would be a safe bet, a sort of straight-to-video schlock film.\nFilming took six weeks and was very difficult, with one member of the cast being arrested on drug charges. However Hewitt says it proved profitable."
