He also spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Sino-American%20relations\"&gt;Sino-American relations&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, helped to win ratification of the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; treaties, and headed the first interagency group on &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;.

The Commission proposed significant reforms of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Rodney%20King\"&gt;Rodney King&lt;/a&gt; incident (see &lt;a href=\"1992%20Los%20Angeles%20riots\"&gt;1992 Los Angeles riots&lt;/a&gt;), which were approved overwhelmingly at the ballot box. In 1992, Christopher headed the vice presidential search for Governor Bill Clinton and served as the Director of &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20transition%20of%20Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;his presidential Transition&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecretary of State for Clinton.\nServing as Secretary of State from January 20, 1993 until January 17, 1997, Christopher's main goals were expanding NATO, establishing peace between Israel and its neighbors, and using economic pressure to force China's hand on human rights practices. The major events transpiring during his tenure included the &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Accords\"&gt;Oslo Accords&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dayton%20Agreement\"&gt;Dayton Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, normalization of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%E2%80%93Vietnam%20relations\"&gt;United States\u2013Vietnam relations&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rwandan%20genocide\"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Uphold%20Democracy\"&gt;Operation Uphold Democracy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Khobar%20Towers%20bombing\"&gt;Khobar Towers bombing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssassination attempt on George H. W. Bush, April 1993.\nOn April 13, 1993, eleven Iraqi intelligence agents smuggled a car bomb into Kuwait in an attempt to assassinate former President &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; as he spoke at &lt;a href=\"Kuwait%20University\"&gt;Kuwait University&lt;/a&gt;. Secretary Christopher, among others, urged President Clinton to make a retaliatory strike against Iraq. On June 26, 1993, the United States &lt;a href=\"Cruise%20missile%20strikes%20on%20Iraq%20%28June%201993%29\"&gt;launched 23 Tomahawk missiles&lt;/a&gt; against the Baghdad intelligence headquarters.\nOslo Accords, September 1993.\nIn August 1993, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; drew up the &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Accords\"&gt;Oslo Accords&lt;/a&gt;, which created the &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20Authority\"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for Palestinian recognition of Israel's right to exist. Secretary Christopher accepted Israeli Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Shimon%20Peres\"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;'s offer to host the signing ceremony. The ceremony took place in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993, with &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud%20Abbas\"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; signing for the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization\"&gt;Palestine Liberation Organization&lt;/a&gt;, Peres signing for the State of Israel, Secretary Christopher signing for the United States and &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Kozyrev\"&gt;Andrei Kozyrev&lt;/a&gt; signing for Russia, in the presence of President Clinton. Christopher was one of the main &lt;a href=\"Visionary\"&gt;visionaries&lt;/a&gt; and proponent of an &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20economic%20integration\"&gt;integrated Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.\nPartnership for Peace NATO expansion, January 1994.\nIn order to initiate further &lt;a href=\"enlargement%20of%20NATO\"&gt;enlargement of NATO&lt;/a&gt; with minimal backlash from Russia, Secretary Christopher promoted the &lt;a href=\"Partnership%20for%20Peace\"&gt;Partnership for Peace&lt;/a&gt; program as a stepping-stone into full NATO membership. This was against protests from the Pentagon.\nRwandan Genocide, 1994.\nIn what is recognized as the terrible failure of the international community, the US and UN failed to intervene to stop the &lt;a href=\"Rwandan%20genocide\"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. Over the course of a hundred days, some 800,000 Tutsis were massacred by Hutu militia. \nChina: Delinking human rights and trade status, May 1994.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1992%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1992 presidential campaign&lt;/a&gt;, then-candidate Clinton blasted President George H. W. Bush for giving &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; low-tariff trading privileges despite its human rights abuses. Secretary Christopher agreed with this view and believed that the US should use economic pressure to force China to improve its human rights record. However, on May 26, 1994, President Clinton renewed China's low-tariff trading privileges, effectively delinking the human rights issue from China's trade relations with the US. U.S.-Sino relations improved as a result, with President &lt;a href=\"Jiang%20Zemin\"&gt;Jiang Zemin&lt;/a&gt; visiting the U.S. in November 1997 and President Clinton visiting China in June 1998.\nOperation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, September 1994.\nOn September 19, 1994, a US-led coalition returned &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;'s popularly elected President &lt;a href=\"Jean-Bertrande%20Aristide\"&gt;Jean-Bertrande Aristide&lt;/a&gt; to power after a coup had unseated him. The US military effort, known as &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Uphold%20Democracy\"&gt;Operation Uphold Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, was largely the product of &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Powell\"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;'s diplomatic efforts, with little role played by Christopher.\nIsrael-Jordan peace treaty, October 1994.\nIn the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, Secretary Christopher encouraged Jordan's &lt;a href=\"King%20Hussein\"&gt;King Hussein&lt;/a&gt; to make a peace treaty with Israel. Christopher eventually offered Hussein $200 million in military equipment and $700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal. On October 27, 1994, Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Yitzchak%20Rabin\"&gt;Yitzchak Rabin&lt;/a&gt; and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the &lt;a href=\"Israel%E2%80%93Jordan%20peace%20treaty\"&gt;Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty&lt;/a&gt;. The signing was witnessed by President Clinton and Secretary Christopher. Christopher sought to obtain a similar treaty between Rabin and Syrian President &lt;a href=\"Hafez%20al-Assad\"&gt;Hafez al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, but to no avail.\nVietnam: Normalizing relations, July 1995.\nWorking with Senator &lt;a href=\"John%20McCain\"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, in 1994, Secretary Christopher began actively promoting the normalization of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%E2%80%93Vietnam%20relations\"&gt;United States\u2013Vietnam relations&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the U.S. had not had an embassy in Vietnam since 1975. The main obstacle to normalization came from veterans and POW/MIA support groups who were convinced that Hanoi was not fully cooperating in the search for the remains of US soldiers in Vietnam. However, after Secretary Christopher convinced President Clinton that the Vietnamese government was fully cooperating in these searches, the President announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on July 11, 1995.\nDayton Agreement, November 1995.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dayton%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Dayton, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary Christopher\u2014working with Assistant Secretary &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Holbrooke\"&gt;Richard Holbrooke&lt;/a&gt;\u2014negotiated peace talks between President of &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87\"&gt;Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franjo%20Tu%C4%91man\"&gt;Franjo Tu\u0111man&lt;/a&gt;, and President of &lt;a href=\"Bosnia\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alija%20Izetbegovi%C4%87\"&gt;Alija Izetbegovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. The result was the November 1995 &lt;a href=\"Dayton%20Agreement\"&gt;Dayton Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20War\"&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhobar Towers bombing, June 1996.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Khobar%20Towers%20bombing\"&gt;Khobar Towers bombing&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary Christopher traveled to Saudi Arabia to witness the site of the attack. In Dhahran (the home of the Khobar Towers), Foreign Minister Prince &lt;a href=\"Saud%20al-Faisal\"&gt;Saud al-Faisal&lt;/a&gt; allegedly promised Christopher that the &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; would have the full cooperation of the Saudi government. Eventually, however, the Saudi government and the FBI repeatedly conflicted during the course of the investigation.\nRetirement.\nIn addition to several honorary degrees, Christopher received the following awards: the Jefferson Award from the American Institute for Public Service for the Greatest Public Service Performed by an Elected or Appointed Official; the &lt;a href=\"UCLA\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; Medal; the Harold Weill Medal from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Garfield\"&gt;James A. Garfield&lt;/a&gt; Baller Award; the Thomas Jefferson Award in Law from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Law School; and the Louis Stein Award from &lt;a href=\"Fordham%20Law%20School\"&gt;Fordham Law School&lt;/a&gt;.\nChristopher's picture hangs in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Remnants%20Museum%20%28Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City%29\"&gt;War Remnants Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City\"&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/a&gt;, near pictures of &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20McNamara\"&gt;Robert McNamara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elmo%20Zumwalt\"&gt;Elmo Zumwalt&lt;/a&gt;, and other American dignitaries, in commemoration of his visit to &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, after normalization of relations between the two countries.\nAt the 1999 unveiling of his portrait at the Department of State, attended by President Clinton, Christopher remarked: \"To anyone who has served in Washington, there is something oddly familiar about [having your portrait painted]. First, you're painted into a corner, then you're hung out to dry and, finally, you're framed.\"\nHe was sent to supervise the contested Florida recount for &lt;a href=\"Al%20Gore\"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2000 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2008 film \"&lt;a href=\"Recount%20%28film%29\"&gt;Recount&lt;/a&gt;\", which covers the days following the controversial election, Christopher was portrayed by British actor &lt;a href=\"John%20Hurt\"&gt;John Hurt&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Institute%20for%20Near%20East%20Policy\"&gt;Washington Institute for Near East Policy&lt;/a&gt; (WINEP) Board of Advisors.\nHe was an Advisory Board member for the &lt;a href=\"Partnership%20for%20a%20Secure%20America\"&gt;Partnership for a Secure America&lt;/a&gt;, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.\nFormer Secretaries of State &lt;a href=\"James%20Baker\"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt; and Christopher served as Co-Chairs of the Miller Center's National War Powers Commission. Baker and Christopher testified on March 5 before the &lt;a href=\"House%20Foreign%20Affairs%20Committee\"&gt;House Foreign Affairs Committee&lt;/a&gt; about the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009 \u2013 the statute that the Commission unanimously recommended in its July 2008 report. The statute is designed to replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and provide for more meaningful consultation between the president and Congress on matters of war.\nFrom 2003 until his death, Christopher taught a small seminar course on international affairs as part of the Honors Program at &lt;a href=\"UCLA\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nWarren Christopher married twice.

The &lt;a href=\"World%20Justice%20Project\"&gt;World Justice Project&lt;/a&gt; works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the &lt;a href=\"Rule%20of%20Law\"&gt;Rule of Law&lt;/a&gt; for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.\nDeath.\nChristopher died at his home in Los Angeles on March 18, 2011, from kidney and bladder cancer.
