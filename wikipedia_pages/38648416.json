    "text": "The Bewties Of The Fute-ball is a brief, anonymous &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Scots\"&gt;Middle Scots&lt;/a&gt; poem of the sixteenth century. It depicts the game of &lt;a href=\"medieval%20football\"&gt;medieval football&lt;/a&gt;, as it was played in the same era, as being violent and unruly.\nHistorical context.\nBall games played between opposing teams were widespread in pre-modern Europe. Many localities are known to have had a variety including the &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Fiorentino\"&gt;Calcio&lt;/a&gt; of Florence and &lt;a href=\"La%20Soule\"&gt;La Soule&lt;/a&gt; of northern France\nIn Scotland football games were common enough for the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to outlaw them on several occasions. An act of 1457, under &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;James II&lt;/a&gt;, is typical. The act was principally intended to encourage archery practice but decreed that football, and also &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, should be simultaneously discouraged.\nor in translation,\nDespite these bans, in 16th-century &lt;a href=\"Perth%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; apprentices progressing to become master craftsmen traditionally had to pay for a banquet and hold a football match. Several ball games which appear to predate the modern era exist in modern Scotland. The &lt;a href=\"Kirkwall%20Ba%20game\"&gt;Kirkwall Ba Game&lt;/a&gt; is an example.\nThe text.\nThe Bewties Of The Fute-ball is preserved only in the &lt;a href=\"Maitland%20Manuscripts\"&gt;Maitland Folio Manuscript&lt;/a&gt; of the latter sixteenth century. It consists of two pairs of rhyming &lt;a href=\"couplet\"&gt;couplet&lt;/a&gt;s and it is attributed to no author.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Scots\"&gt;Modern Scots&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe poem might be translated into modern English as,\nIt is not clear whether the poem is genuinely criticising the game for its roughness or praising it ironically for the same reason."
