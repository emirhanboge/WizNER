    "text": "Pinega Nature Reserve (, \"Pinezhsky Zapovednik\") is a &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt; (a \"&lt;a href=\"zapovednik\"&gt;zapovednik&lt;/a&gt;\") in the north of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Pinezhsky%20District\"&gt;Pinezhsky District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arkhangelsk%20Oblast\"&gt;Arkhangelsk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, about 150 km due east of the city of &lt;a href=\"Arkhangelsk\"&gt;Arkhangelsk&lt;/a&gt;. The reserve is on the right bank of the &lt;a href=\"Pinega%20River\"&gt;Pinega River&lt;/a&gt; and on both banks of the &lt;a href=\"Sotka%20River\"&gt;Sotka River&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the &lt;a href=\"Kuloy%20River%20%28White%20Sea%29\"&gt;Kuloy River&lt;/a&gt;. It was established August\u00a020, 1974. The nature reserve is created to protect the &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscapes and the coniferous forests (&lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;) of the Northern Russia.\nLocation and geography.\nThe area of the nature reserve is elongated from north to south. The south-eastern border runs parallel to the course of the Pinega at the distance of several kilometers from the riverbed, approximately between the villages of &lt;a href=\"Valdokurye\"&gt;Valdokurye&lt;/a&gt; and Pelino. The southern part of the nature reserve belongs to the Belaya River, a tributary of the Pinega. The northern part is crossed from the west to the east by the Sotka River.\nPinezhsky Nature Reserve protects three types of landscapes: &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;y flatland (in the western part, on the divide between the Kuloy and the Pinega river basins); hilly &lt;a href=\"plateau\"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt; (which is the south-eastern part of the White Sea - Kuloy Plateau which rises to the east of the &lt;a href=\"Dvina%20Bay\"&gt;Dvina Bay&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscapes. Whereas the first two are somehow typical for Arkhangelsk Oblast, the karst is unique. There are such distinctive features of the karst as caves (more than 500 in the reserve limits), ravines (some of them up to long), and lakes. There are 83 lakes in the reserve, and most of them are karst lakes. Two of the creeks vanish below the earth, with one of them, the Karyala, reappearing after at the side of a ravine.\nEcoregion and climate.\nThe reserve is in the \"&lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20and%20Russian%20taiga\"&gt;Scandinavian and Russian taiga&lt;/a&gt;\" ecoregion. Its climate classification is \"&lt;a href=\"Humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;Humid continental climate, cool summer&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Subarctic%20climate%23Koppen%20Dfc\"&gt;(Dfc)&lt;/a&gt;). This climate is characterized by long cold winters, and short, cool summers.\nFlora.\nThere are 480 plant species in the reserve, some of which are endemic for North-East of the European Russia. The reserve is mostly covered by forests, which are &lt;a href=\"Abies%20sibirica\"&gt;siberian fir&lt;/a&gt; (72.5%), pine (16%), birch (7%) and larch (4.6%). Most of the birch forests occupy the area where the woods previously burnt down or were cut down. Minor areas, mostly in &lt;a href=\"floodplains\"&gt;floodplains&lt;/a&gt;, are occupied by meadows.\nFauna.\nThe area of the reserve is small, and most of the animals do not reside there permanently but migrate. Among the species that occur in the reserve are &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brown%20bear\"&gt;brown bear&lt;/a&gt; (between 15 and 20), &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolverine\"&gt;wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gray%20wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"badger\"&gt;badger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20mink\"&gt;European mink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20otter\"&gt;European otter&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nHistory.\nThe valley of the Pinega River was populated by Russians since at least the 13th century, and the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Pinega\"&gt;Pinega&lt;/a&gt;, located close to the current area of the nature reserve, has been known since the 17th century. However, there were no settlements away from the right bank of the Pinega, and the area was not really used for any development.\nThe creation of the nature reserve was initiated by the biologist &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Saburov\"&gt;Dmitry Saburov&lt;/a&gt; (1931-1996) who from 1963 to 1966 investigated the woods which at the time belonged to Pinega and Karpogory forest enterprises. Saburov then suggested to create the nature reserve of the area of , and the project was supported by academic circles, in the first instance by Saburov's home institution, the &lt;a href=\"Komarov%20Botanical%20Institute\"&gt;Komarov Botanical Institute&lt;/a&gt;. However, the project met resistance from the timber industry, and as a compromise, the natural reserve was open in 1974 with the area of . Eventually the area was extended to , the last extension was performed in 1996.\nRecreation and tourism.\nThe nature reserve has a relatively remote location, however, it gets a share of tourists visiting the caves.\nIn 2004, the Karst Museum was open in the reserve."
