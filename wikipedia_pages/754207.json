He was in their squads for three &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter retiring as a player, Stam worked as a coach at &lt;a href=\"PEC%20Zwolle\"&gt;PEC Zwolle&lt;/a&gt; and Ajax before making his managerial debut with &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. He later managed &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord\"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Cincinnati\"&gt;FC Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Kampen%2C%20Overijssel\"&gt;Kampen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overijssel\"&gt;Overijssel&lt;/a&gt;, Stam started his career with local amateur football club &lt;a href=\"DOS%20Kampen\"&gt;DOS Kampen&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 August 1992, Stam made his professional debut for &lt;a href=\"PEC%20Zwolle\"&gt;FC Zwolle&lt;/a&gt; in a 1\u20131 draw against &lt;a href=\"Heracles%20Almelo\"&gt;SC Heracles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eerste%20Divisie\"&gt;Eerste Divisie&lt;/a&gt;. He became a first team regular right away and moved to &lt;a href=\"Eredivisie\"&gt;Eredivisie&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"SC%20Cambuur\"&gt;Cambuur Leeuwarden&lt;/a&gt; for the following season, but relegated in his first season which brought him back into the Eerste Divisie. Two seasons at Cambuur earned him a transfer to Eredivisie club &lt;a href=\"Willem%20II%20%28football%20club%29\"&gt;Willem II&lt;/a&gt;. At Willem II, he immediately impressed at the Eredivisie level, which meant his final breakthrough. A shock 1\u20130 home victory over &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; led to Stam's transfer to &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; in the same season in which they eventually won the &lt;a href=\"KNVB%20Cup\"&gt;KNVB Cup&lt;/a&gt;, his first professional trophy.\nPSV.\nStam was a key player for PSV in the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20Eredivisie\"&gt;1996\u201397 season&lt;/a&gt;, as the team won the Eredivisie league championship and the &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff%20Shield\"&gt;Johan Cruyff Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Individually, Stam won the VVCS Footballer of the Year award.\nIn 1998, Stam became the then &lt;a href=\"World%20football%20transfer%20record\"&gt;most expensive&lt;/a&gt; defender in history when &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; bought him for &lt;a href=\"Pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;10.6\u00a0million.\nManchester United.\nStam spent three seasons at Manchester United, during which time United won three &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; titles, one &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;. He scored his only goal for the club in a 6\u20132 away victory against &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly in the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt; season, Stam was controversially sold to &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; in Italy after Manchester United manager &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Sir Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; was reportedly upset by allegations Stam had made in his autobiography \"Head to Head\" about the club. Stam made numerous statements in the book about his views on opposing players, and notoriously alleged that Ferguson's approach to buy him was done without the permission of PSV. Later, &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Kuper\"&gt;Simon Kuper&lt;/a&gt; reported that contrary to initial belief, Ferguson had noticed that Stam's tackling numbers were declining and simply assumed the defender was past his playing peak. &lt;a href=\"Laurent%20Blanc\"&gt;Laurent Blanc&lt;/a&gt; was signed as his replacement.\nIn 2007, however, Ferguson described the decision to sell Stam as an error: \"At the time he had just come back from an achilles injury and we thought he had just lost a little bit. We got the offer from Lazio, \u00a316.5m for a centre back who was 29. It was an offer I couldn't refuse. But in playing terms it was a mistake. He is still playing for Ajax at a really good level.\" On the financial report, Manchester United announced the fee was \u00a315.3\u00a0million; Lazio declared the fee was \u00a316\u00a0million.\nLazio.\nDuring his time with Lazio, Stam was found guilty of having the banned steroid &lt;a href=\"nandrolone\"&gt;nandrolone&lt;/a&gt; in his system following a &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; game, and received a five-month ban, which was eventually reduced by a month after appeals. He was the second Lazio player suspended in 2001, after &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Couto\"&gt;Fernando Couto&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn his last season at the club, he won the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilan.\nStam joined &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;. He reached his second Champions League final with the \"Rossoneri\" in &lt;a href=\"2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, but was a runner-up after his team was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt;.\nAjax.\nOn 30 January 2006, it was announced that he would return to the Eredivisie and play for Ajax, where he signed a two-year contract for a \u20ac2.5\u00a0million transfer fee. Stam was named team captain upon his arrival at the club. In his first season, he won both the Johan Cruyff Shield and the KNVB Cup; another Johan Cruyff Shield was added to his trophies at the start of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20AFC%20Ajax%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 29 October 2007, Stam announced his retirement from professional football with immediate effect after playing six league games for Ajax in the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Eredivisie\"&gt;2007\u201308 league&lt;/a&gt; season. His final game was in a 0\u20130 draw against &lt;a href=\"N.E.C.%20%28football%20club%29\"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt; on 20 October 2007.\nInternational career.\nStam made his debut for &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; on 24 April 1996 in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. He was not initially chosen for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%2096\"&gt;UEFA Euro 96&lt;/a&gt;, but was later added to the squad after an injury ruled out &lt;a href=\"Frank%20de%20Boer\"&gt;Frank de Boer&lt;/a&gt;; he did not however make any appearances at the tournament. He scored his first goal on 6 September 1997 in a 3\u20131 home win over rivals Belgium in World Cup qualification. He was also an important player in the Dutch team that finished fourth in the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt;, he once again reached the semi-finals with the Dutch team, hosted in his home country and Belgium. Stam missed his attempt in the penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals, smashing the ball over the goal in a defeat against &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. He was not originally scheduled to take a penalty, but had to due to substitutions and fatigue among the Dutch.\nStam reached his third semi-finals in an international competition with his nation at &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt; in Portugal and retired from international football after the tournament. The reason cited for his international retirement was that he wanted to focus on his new team, Milan, as well as his family.\nIn total, he played 67 matches for the Netherlands, scoring three goals.\nPlaying style.\nStam played primarily as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre-back\"&gt;centre-back&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for possessing \"a rare combination of speed, strength and ball-playing ability\", as well as an excellent positional sense. Due to his wide range of skills, in his prime he was also capable of playing as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back\"&gt;full-back&lt;/a&gt; on the right flank.\nPost-playing career.\nIn October 2008, Stam returned to Manchester United as a scout for the club, responsible for most of South America.\nSoccer Aid.\nStam has been involved with &lt;a href=\"Soccer%20Aid\"&gt;Soccer Aid&lt;/a&gt;, which puts celebrities and football legends together in two teams (England and Rest of the World) for a charity game in aid of &lt;a href=\"UNICEF\"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;.
