    "text": "The was an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Army&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"call%20sign\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt; was the . It was formed on 24 August 1937 in &lt;a href=\"Kanazawa\"&gt;Kanazawa&lt;/a&gt; as a square division, simultaneously with the &lt;a href=\"108th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;108th division&lt;/a&gt;. The nucleus for the formation was the &lt;a href=\"9th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;9th division&lt;/a&gt; headquarters. It was subordinated from the beginning to the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Northern%20China%20Area%20Army\"&gt;Japanese Northern China Area Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst formation.\nThe \"109th division\" was sent to &lt;a href=\"North%20China\"&gt;North China&lt;/a&gt; in October 1937. It closely cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"108th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;108th division&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to the &lt;a href=\"Beiping%E2%80%93Hankou%20Railway%20Operation\"&gt;Beiping\u2013Hankou Railway Operation&lt;/a&gt; and the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Linfen\"&gt;Linfen&lt;/a&gt; city. Later it also provided a garrison for the &lt;a href=\"Shanxi\"&gt;Shanxi&lt;/a&gt; province. The division was eventually dissolved 24 December 1939.\nSecond formation.\nThe \"109th division\" was reformed in May 1944 from &lt;a href=\"1st%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;1st Independent Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Bonin%20Islands\"&gt;Bonin Islands&lt;/a&gt; garrisons reinforced by recruits from &lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dfu\"&gt;K\u014dfu&lt;/a&gt; mobilization district. The \"109th Division\" was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Thirty-First%20Army%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;31st army&lt;/a&gt;, under Commanding Lieutenant General &lt;a href=\"Hideyoshi%20Obata\"&gt;Hideyoshi Obata&lt;/a&gt;. It comprised the bulk of the Japanese garrison on the volcanic islands of &lt;a href=\"Iwo%20Jima\"&gt;Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chichi-jima\"&gt;Chichi Jima&lt;/a&gt; which was wiped out by American forces from February to March 1945 in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima\"&gt;Battle of Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe structure of the 109th was different than most divisions in the IJA. After 1936, the normal make up of a division was the triangular organization, with three infantry regiments to a division. The 109th (along with the 91st Infantry Division) were considered square divisions because they had two infantry brigades (5000 men each) with two infantry regiments each. During the buildup prior to the attack of Iwo-jima General Kuribayashi divided the 109th and each was built up to maximum strengths. The 109th, as the Ogasawara island Detachment was the Ogasawara (&lt;a href=\"Bonin%20Islands\"&gt;Bonin Islands&lt;/a&gt;) District Group, also called the Ogasawara Army Group, with an approximate strength of 47,000 troops.\n1st Brigade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1st%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;1st Independent Mixed Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, led by Major General Tachibana, and the \"17th Independent Mixed Regiment\", as well as other elements, were stationed on &lt;a href=\"Chichijima\"&gt;Chichi Jima&lt;/a&gt; (Father Island) with approximately 25,000 troops. Many were deployed to other island defenses such as the rest of the middle cluster known as Father Island (groups); Ani-jima, Ototo-jima, Mago-jima, along with islets Higashi-jima, Nishi-jima, and Minami-jima. The northernmost cluster or Groom Islands (group) included; Yome-jima, Muko-jima, and Nak\u014ddo-jima or Nakadachi-jima. The southernmost cluster known as the Mother Island (group) of &lt;a href=\"Haha-jima\"&gt;Haha-jima&lt;/a&gt;, Ane-jima, Im\u014dto-jima, Mei-jima, along with the smaller Hira-shima and Muko-jima. These groups of islands were by-passed when Iwo-jima was chosen to attack but were subjected to bombing and naval shelling by the U.S. military.\n2nd Brigade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29\"&gt;2nd Independent Mixed Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, led by Major General Kotau Osuga, and the \"Third Battalion\" of the 17th Regiment, led by Major Tomachi Fujiwara, was on Iwo Jima with Kuribayashi. The 2700 man 145th infantry regiment under Colonel Masuo Ikeda, a part of 46th division, was diverted from &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; to Iwo Jima and Rear Admiral Toshinosuke Ichimaru that arrived with 2300 navy personnel.\nMany of the 109th's personnel had previously served in China, Burma and the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; and had become reservists who were now reluctant to go back to battle. To bolster morale the Japanese Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hirohito\"&gt;Hirohito&lt;/a&gt; sent his own palace guard of anti-aircraft gunners to Chichi Jima to support the troops\u2014as it was expected the main force of Americans would strike there, however the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to bypass Chichi Jima altogether.\nPreparations.\nWith preparations underway Kuribayashi worked with the tactic of defense-in-depth building numerous &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20%28military%29\"&gt;pillboxes&lt;/a&gt; for machine-gunners and 13,000 yards of tunnels with even a field-hospital worked in. However he had issues with many officers\u2014dismissing 18 of them along with his Chief-of-staff, Kuribayashi also lost control of the Naval troops who dug in on the beaches.\nThe Battle Begins.\nOn 19 February 1945 the battle began, but quickly came the feeling that the 109th were doomed as air or naval relief would not be able to help. Kuribayashi ordered his troops to inflict maximum damage and casualties on the enemy and to \"kill 10 men before dying\".\nFor 33 days the 109th fought on Iwo Jima, facing against tanks and heavy bombardments from the sea and air. In the end only 1083 Japanese survived, with a mere 216 captured from the 109th's 21,000 men during the battle, the other 867 Japanese soldiers came from other units. As for Kuribayashi, it is generally thought that he committed suicide by leading the last major counterattack. The rest held out hungry and alone in Iwo Jima's tunnels until the U.S. soldiers used explosives to clear the tunnels weeks later.\nElements of the 109th.\nThe 109th Division comprised the 1st and 2nd Mixed Brigade. The 3rd Battalion of the 17th Independent Mixed Regiment was on Iwo Jima and there were many attached units\nHeadquarters Group.\nThe 109th Chief of staff (detached to Chichi jima); Colonel Hori, was replaced with Colonel Tadashi Takaishi\n145th Regiment.\nCommanding officer; Colonel Masuo Ikeda, approx. 2,700 men\n145th Infantry Regiment, Captain Masuda\nThird Battalion.\nThird Battalion, 17th Independent Mixed Regiment; Major Tomachi Fujiwara\n26th tank Regiment.\nCommanding officer; Lieutenant Colonel (Baron) &lt;a href=\"Takeichi%20Nishi\"&gt;Takeichi Nishi&lt;/a&gt;, 600 men and what started as 19 tanks. Many of the tanks were disassembled and the turrets concealed so they could be used with less threat of being destroyed by bombardment.\n2nd Mixed Brigade.\nCommanding officer; General Osuga was replaced with Major General Sadasue Senda, approx. 5200 men\nBrigade Artillery Group, Colonel Chosaku Kaido\nNavy.\nNaval Guard Force, Captain Samaji Inoue\nOther units.\nThe exact strength of Navy personnel is subject to question. With an estimate of approximately 21,000 troops it was reported that the IJA had 17,500 troops and the IJN had 5,500 troops and another report 13,586 IJA and 7,347 IJN troops.\nKnowledgeable Predictions.\nDuring a dinner with Major Yoshitaka Horie (in charge of 109th Divisions Detached Headquarters on Chichi Jima) Kuribayashi asked Horie his opinion for defending Iwo Jima, to which Horie replied it was vulnerable as \"a pile of eggs\" and better to sink it to the bottom of the ocean with enough explosives. Kuribayashi\u2014who had spent much time in Canada as deputy military attache and traveled often in America\u2014was in agreement, however they knew that at 628 miles from Tokyo Iwo Jima would be \"a dagger aimed straight at the heart of the homeland\". Before leaving Japan to take up his post, Kuribayashi had informed his wife not to expect him home."
