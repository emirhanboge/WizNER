On the death of his father on 2 May 1754, he had succeeded to &lt;a href=\"Fawsley%20Hall\"&gt;Fawsley Hall&lt;/a&gt;, which he developed in the 1760s by employing &lt;a href=\"Capability%20Brown\"&gt;Capability Brown&lt;/a&gt; on his gardens.\nCareer.\nHe was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Northamptonshire\"&gt;High Sheriff of Northamptonshire&lt;/a&gt; in 1770\u201371.\nKnightley was returned for &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Northampton&lt;/a&gt; at a by-election on 21 November 1763 on the Compton interest.
