    "text": "Secunderabad Junction (station code: SC) is a major intercity junction railway station and a &lt;a href=\"commuter%20rail\"&gt;commuter rail&lt;/a&gt; hub in the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; urban area. In the city centre, the station is in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20Railway%20zone\"&gt;South Central Railway zone&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Railways\"&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/a&gt;. Built in 1874 by the &lt;a href=\"Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad\"&gt;Nizam of Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British era&lt;/a&gt;, it was the main station of &lt;a href=\"Nizam%27s%20Guaranteed%20State%20Railway\"&gt;Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Kachiguda%20railway%20station\"&gt;Kachiguda railway station&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1916. The station was taken over by Indian Railways in 1951, when NGSR was nationalized. Its main &lt;a href=\"portico\"&gt;portico&lt;/a&gt; and concourse are influenced by Nizamesque architecture. The station, which resembles a fort, is a tourist attraction in the twin cities of Hyderabad and &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad\"&gt;Secunderabad&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is connected by rail to all regions of India. About 170,000 passengers arrive at (or depart from) the station daily on 229 trains. On the &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada%20Junction\"&gt;Vijayawada&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Wadi\"&gt;Wadi&lt;/a&gt; (the SCR's main line) and &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad%E2%80%93Manmad%20line\"&gt;Secunderabad\u2013Manmad&lt;/a&gt; railway lines, it is the zone headquarters of the South Central Railway and the headquarters of the SCR's Secunderabad Division. The station has received &lt;a href=\"ISO%209000\"&gt;ISO-9001 certification&lt;/a&gt; for quality management in ticket booking, parcel and luggage booking and &lt;a href=\"Railway%20platform\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; management. Indian Railways has proposed an upgrade to a world-class station, emphasising vertical expansion. It is connected to nearly all the parts of the twin cities by the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Multi-Modal%20Transport%20System\"&gt;Hyderabad MMTS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TSRTC\"&gt;Telangana State Road Transport Corporation&lt;/a&gt; buses and the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Metro\"&gt;Hyderabad Metro&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nNizam era.\nThe station was proposed in 1870, when the &lt;a href=\"Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad\"&gt;Nizam of Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; MIR MEHBOOB ALI KHAN SIDDIQUI ordered to construct the secundrabad railway station, the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad state decided to connect &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20State\"&gt;Hyderabad State&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of India. &lt;a href=\"Nizam%27s%20Guaranteed%20State%20Railway\"&gt;Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway&lt;/a&gt; was formed as a private company, and construction of the Secunderabad\u2013Wadi line began that year. The line, which would connect Hyderabad with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Great%20Indian%20Peninsula%20Railway\"&gt;Great Indian Peninsula Railway&lt;/a&gt; main line at &lt;a href=\"Wadi%2C%20Karnataka\"&gt;Wadi Junction&lt;/a&gt;, was funded by the Nizam.\nThe Secunderabad\u2013Wadi line and the Secunderabad railway station were finished on 9 October 1874, introducing railways to Hyderabad. The station's main portico and concourse were influenced by Nizam-era architecture. Resembling a fort, it is a tourist attraction in the twin cities. Hyderabad State took over the railway in 1879. In 1871, the Secunderabad station was connected to the &lt;a href=\"Singareni%20Collieries%20Company\"&gt;Singareni Collieries Company&lt;/a&gt; by a line. The Secunderabad\u2013Wadi line was extended to &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada%20Junction\"&gt;Vijayawada Junction&lt;/a&gt; as the Vijayawada\u2013Wadi line in 1889. A &lt;a href=\"broad-gauge\"&gt;broad-gauge&lt;/a&gt; connection between Vijayawada Junction and &lt;a href=\"Chennai%20Central\"&gt;Chennai Central&lt;/a&gt; opened the following year, enabling rail travel between &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%2C%20Telangana\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; (then &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%E2%80%93Godavari%20Valley%20Railway\"&gt;Hyderabad\u2013Godavari Valley Railway&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1900 with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Manmad\"&gt;Manmad&lt;/a&gt;\u2013Secunderabad &lt;a href=\"metre-gauge\"&gt;metre-gauge&lt;/a&gt; line, and merged into the NGSR in 1930. In 1916, the Kachiguda railway station was built as &lt;a href=\"Nizam%27s%20Guaranteed%20State%20Railway\"&gt;NGSR&lt;/a&gt; headquarters and to regulate traffic at Secunderabad. Diesel rail cars manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Ganz\"&gt;Ganz&lt;/a&gt; were tried for the first time in Hyderabad State by the NGSR in 1939.\nIndian Railways.\nOn 5 November 1951, &lt;a href=\"Nizam%27s%20Guaranteed%20State%20Railway\"&gt;Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway&lt;/a&gt; was nationalized by the &lt;a href=\"government%20of%20India\"&gt;government of India&lt;/a&gt; and merged into the government-owned &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Railways\"&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/a&gt; (IR) as part of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Railways%20%28India%29\"&gt;Ministry of Railways&lt;/a&gt;. The Secunderabad station was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Railway%20zone\"&gt;Central Railway zone&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Chhatrapati%20Shivaji%20Terminus%20railway%20station\"&gt;Victoria Terminus&lt;/a&gt; its headquarters. In 1966, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20Railway%20zone\"&gt;South Central Railway zone&lt;/a&gt; was formed with Secunderabad its headquarters (as well as the headquarters of Indian Railways' Secunderabad Division. &lt;a href=\"Rail%20Nilayam\"&gt;Rail Nilayam&lt;/a&gt; (the zone headquarters) was built in 1972, and the division headquarters was built in 1980.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Railways%20Institute%20of%20Signal%20Engineering%20and%20Telecommunications\"&gt;Indian Railways Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications&lt;/a&gt; (IRISET), one of IR's six centralised training institutes, was established in Secunderabad by the Ministry of Railways on 24 November 1957. to address the specialised training needs of railway staff and officers in &lt;a href=\"railway%20signalling\"&gt;railway signalling&lt;/a&gt; and telecommunications. In 1967, the &lt;a href=\"Ajanta%20Express\"&gt;Ajanta Express&lt;/a&gt; was introduced between Kachiguda and &lt;a href=\"Manmad\"&gt;Manmad&lt;/a&gt; via Secunderabad. With an average speed of , it was India's fastest &lt;a href=\"metre-gauge\"&gt;metre-gauge&lt;/a&gt; train at the time. The Secunderabad\u2013&lt;a href=\"Vijayawada%20Junction\"&gt;Vijayawada Junction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Golconda%20Express\"&gt;Golconda Express&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1969. The country's fastest &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; train, with an average speed of . it was later extended to &lt;a href=\"Guntur\"&gt;Guntur&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1978, the Secunderabad Division was split into two divisions: Secunderabad and Hyderabad.\nAlthough an early computerised reservation system began at Secunderabad in July 1989, the 30 September 1989 introduction of SCR's computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS) at the station made reservations easier. The system, later linked to &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; (1997), &lt;a href=\"Howrah\"&gt;Howrah&lt;/a&gt; (1998), &lt;a href=\"Mumbai\"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; (both 1999), preceded the CONCERT reservation system which was developed at Secunderabad in September 1994 and implemented in January 1995.\nThe Secunderabad\u2013&lt;a href=\"Mahbubnagar\"&gt;Mahbubnagar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metre-gauge\"&gt;metre-gauge&lt;/a&gt; section was converted to &lt;a href=\"broad%20gauge\"&gt;broad gauge&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, breaking an important north\u2013south metre-gauge freight connection north from Secunderabad. That year, the Secunderabad station was electrified towards &lt;a href=\"Kazipet\"&gt;Kazipet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada%20Junction\"&gt;Vijayawada Junction&lt;/a&gt;. The electric-locomotive shed in South Lallaguda (near the Secunderabad station), with a capacity of 100 locomotives, was built in 1995.\n21st century.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rajdhani%20Express\"&gt;Rajdhani Express&lt;/a&gt;, which connects India's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20state%20and%20union%20territory%20capitals%20in%20India\"&gt;state capitals&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; (the national capital), was proposed in &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; between Secunderabad and the &lt;a href=\"Hazrat%20Nizamuddin%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station&lt;/a&gt; in the 2001 Indian rail budget. The &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad%20Rajdhani%20Express\"&gt;Secunderabad Rajdhani Express&lt;/a&gt; was introduced on 27 February 2002. The &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Multi-Modal%20Transport%20System\"&gt;Hyderabad Multi-Modal Transport System&lt;/a&gt; (MMTS), the state's first of its kind, was introduced in 2003 with two lines: \u2013&lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hyderabad railway station&lt;/a&gt; (initially 13 trains daily) and Lingampally\u2013 Secunderabad (11 trains daily). Another line was built between Secunderabad and &lt;a href=\"Falaknuma%20railway%20station\"&gt;Falaknuma railway station&lt;/a&gt;. SCR operated the last metre-gauge train on the &lt;a href=\"Nizamabad%2C%20Telangana\"&gt;Nizamabad&lt;/a&gt;\u2013Manoharabad line on 30 June 2004, ending metre-gauge service (which began during the 1930s on the Secunderabad\u2013&lt;a href=\"Manmad\"&gt;Manmad&lt;/a&gt; line of the NGSR) to facilitate IR's broad-gauge track-conversion program. The line was open by 7 February 2005 after the conversion, permitting railway traffic on the Secunderabad\u2013Manmad stretch of the Kachiguda\u2013Manmad line.\nSCR introduced the \"Himalaya Special\" freight train at Secunderabad on 7 November 2007. Intended for the high-speed transport of freight such as coal, the train was expected to run at . The 2008\u20132009 &lt;a href=\"Rail%20Budget\"&gt;Rail Budget&lt;/a&gt; provided for Secunderabad to upgrade to a world-class station. SCR's first &lt;a href=\"Duronto%20Express\"&gt;Duronto Express&lt;/a&gt;, between Secunderabad and &lt;a href=\"Hazrat%20Nizamuddin%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station&lt;/a&gt;, was flagged off by then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister &lt;a href=\"Konijeti%20Rosaiah\"&gt;Konijeti Rosaiah&lt;/a&gt; at Secunderabad on 14 March 2010.\nStation.\nSecunderabad is one of India's largest and busiest railway stations. The main railway terminus and a commuter hub in the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; urban area (the capital of &lt;a href=\"Telangana\"&gt;Telangana&lt;/a&gt;), it is one of three major stations serving the city; the other two are Kacheguda and the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Deccan%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hyderabad Deccan railway station&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe station is the zone headquarters of South Central Railway and the headquarters of the Secunderabad Division. It is the busiest railway station in the state and SCR's Second-largest junction, after Vijayawada Junction. To reduce traffic at Secunderabad, the &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Board%20%28India%29\"&gt;Railway Board&lt;/a&gt; has decided on a fourth major station in Hyderabad. There are two proposals for the new terminal: and &lt;a href=\"Moula-Ali\"&gt;Moula-Ali&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecunderabad Station has a standard station layout. All its tracks are broad-gauge and electrified. The &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad%E2%80%93Manmad%20line\"&gt;Secunderabad\u2013Manmad line&lt;/a&gt; is non-electrified, however, so diesel trains are common.\nThe station has 10 platforms, which are covered by a &lt;a href=\"reinforced%20concrete\"&gt;reinforced concrete&lt;/a&gt; roof. Each platform can handle a train with more than 24 coaches. There is an additional track between platforms seven and eight, which is a service track for the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Multi-Modal%20Transport%20System\"&gt;Hyderabad Multi-Modal Transport System&lt;/a&gt; and suburban trains (where two trains halt at the same platform, due to their short length). Platforms six and seven are divided in two (6A and B and 7A and B).\nPlatform use is:\nSecunderabad is a junction of tracks from five directions:\nThe Vijayawada\u2013Secunderabad and Repalle\u2013Secunderabad lines join at , near Secunderabad. The Vijayawada Junction\u2013Wadi line is the only electrified line.\nService.\nThe station is serviced by an average of 229 &lt;a href=\"Inter-city%20rail\"&gt;Inter-city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"suburban%20rail\"&gt;suburban rail&lt;/a&gt; trains daily. Most trains originate or terminate at Secunderabad. The Vijayawada\u2013Wadi line, which passes through the station, is one of SCR's busiest lines. It is also an IR freight station. Its Freight Operation Information System monitors freight movement.\nSecunderabad is served by a number of lines:\nInter-city.\nIt is one of Indian Railways' busiest stations. About 170,000 passengers use Secunderabad daily on over 200 trains. The &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad%20Rajdhani%20Express\"&gt;Secunderabad Rajdhani Express&lt;/a&gt;, between Secunderabad and the &lt;a href=\"Hazrat%20Nizamuddin%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station&lt;/a&gt;, was introduced on 27 February 2002. Another daily &lt;a href=\"Rajdhani%20Express\"&gt;Rajdhani Express&lt;/a&gt;, originating at the &lt;a href=\"Bangalore%20City%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bangalore City railway station&lt;/a&gt;, also stops at Secunderabad. Several &lt;a href=\"Garib%20Rath%20Express\"&gt;Garib Rath Express&lt;/a&gt; trains stop at the station, including the daily &lt;a href=\"Visakhapatnam%E2%80%93Secunderabad%20Garib%20Rath%20Express\"&gt;Visakhapatnam\u2013Secunderabad Garib Rath Express&lt;/a&gt; and a train to &lt;a href=\"Yeswanthpur\"&gt;Yeswanthpur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bangalore\"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. The non-stop &lt;a href=\"Duronto%20Express\"&gt;Duronto Express&lt;/a&gt; was introduced between Secunderabad and Hazrat Nizamuddin.\nAll &lt;a href=\"inter-city%20rail\"&gt;inter-city rail&lt;/a&gt; service is operated by Indian Railways. The bi-weekly Secunderabad\u2013Mumbai Duronto Express, announced in the 2010\u201311 Union Railway Budget, was expected to begin by 31 March 2011. Most inter-city service operate to &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada%20Junction\"&gt;Vijayawada Junction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guntur%20Junction\"&gt;Guntur Junction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenali\"&gt;Tenali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Visakhapatnam\"&gt;Visakhapatnam&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Howrah%20station\"&gt;Howrah station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chennai%20Central\"&gt;Chennai Central&lt;/a&gt; and Bangalore. The greatest passenger volume is between Secunderabad and Visakhapatnam. The &lt;a href=\"Godavari%20Express\"&gt;Godavari Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gowthami%20Express\"&gt;Gowthami Express&lt;/a&gt; are SCR's most prestigious trains.\nCommuter rail.\nSecunderabad is the only station in the Hyderabad MMTS to connect to all four MMTS commuter lines, and is the system's commuter inter-change hub. The station is on Lines 2 and 3 of the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Metro\"&gt;Hyderabad Metro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Secunderabad%20East%20metro%20station\"&gt;Secunderabad East metro station&lt;/a&gt;, on the blue line, is near Secunderabad Junction.\nSecunderabad Station is also the hub of suburban &lt;a href=\"Mass%20transit\"&gt;transit&lt;/a&gt; trains (push-pull trains). These DHMU's run in the non-&lt;a href=\"electrified\"&gt;electrified&lt;/a&gt; rail lines in the suburbs of the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; Urban Area. These also run in the electrified lines of &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20Multi-Modal%20Transport%20System\"&gt;MMTS&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe following Hyderabad MMTS lines originate at (or pass through) Secunderabad:\nFacilities.\nSecunderabad has a number of passenger facilities, including modern security and parking. A coach depot for cleaning and maintenance is next to the station. The area around the station is sometimes congested. The station has restaurants, cafes, a coffee shop, book stalls, waiting and cloak rooms, a &lt;a href=\"cyber%20cafe\"&gt;cyber cafe&lt;/a&gt;, tourism agents' and train-inquiry counters, digital train-status boards, train-status announcements and foot bridges. A pharmacy has a dispensary and first-aid kit.\nThree waiting rooms are at the station's north entrance, and two are at the south entrance. An &lt;a href=\"air-conditioned\"&gt;air-conditioned&lt;/a&gt; waiting room is on platform 1, and a non-air-conditioned dormitory is on the first floor. The air-conditioned waiting room is free of charge for passengers with air-conditioned-class tickets. The latest dormitory would supplement the existing air-conditioned dormitory with eight beds and 13 rooms, each with two beds.\nBoth south-entrance waiting rooms, on platform 10, are &lt;a href=\"air-conditioned\"&gt;air-conditioned&lt;/a&gt;. Intended for upper- and second-class passengers, they have comfortable chairs and &lt;a href=\"pay%20toilet\"&gt;pay toilet&lt;/a&gt;s. Nearly 11,000 passengers use the waiting rooms daily.\nSecunderabad is well-stocked with security equipment (including &lt;a href=\"CCTV\"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt;s, door-frame &lt;a href=\"metal%20detectors\"&gt;metal detectors&lt;/a&gt; and hand-held &lt;a href=\"sensors\"&gt;sensors&lt;/a&gt;) and security personnel. Forty-five fixed and &lt;a href=\"pan%E2%80%93tilt%E2%80%93zoom%20camera\"&gt;pan\u2013tilt\u2013zoom camera&lt;/a&gt;s are installed throughout the station, equipped with internet-enabled &lt;a href=\"digital%20video%20recorder\"&gt;digital video recorder&lt;/a&gt;s and interconnected display monitors. The PTZ cameras can rotate 360 degrees, and have a range of one kilometre. The system is controlled at the station's &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Protection%20Force\"&gt;Railway Protection Force&lt;/a&gt; post.\nRPF personnel are also available to monitor suspicious activity, and nine surveillance cameras were installed at the station after the &lt;a href=\"13%20September%202008%20Delhi%20bombings\"&gt;13 September 2008 Delhi bombings&lt;/a&gt;. Indian Railways plan to equip a commando outfit modeled on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;National Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Counter-terrorism\"&gt;counter terrorism&lt;/a&gt; at the station.\nAfter increasing &lt;a href=\"Terrorism%20in%20India\"&gt;terrorist threats&lt;/a&gt;, SCR began baggage checks at an estimated cost of 40\u00a0&lt;a href=\"lakh\"&gt;lakh&lt;/a&gt; (4 million, or US$65,000) as part of a pilot project. To increase security, railway authorities introduced an integrated security system as part of the 2009 Rail Budget.\nOn 14 July 2008, a caller rang up the police main control room around 10:30\u00a0a.m. and said that bombs had been placed at the railway station, passport office, and a Secunderabad bus stop. Between 1:00 and 1:15\u00a0p.m on 15 July, four smoke bombs were said to be about to go off on platforms one, six and seven. Railway authorities immediately alerted the EMRI 108 service in what was a drill.\nAn actual bomb threat was phoned in to the &lt;a href=\"Cyberabad%20Metropolitan%20Police\"&gt;Cyberabad Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%20City%20Police\"&gt;Hyderabad City Police&lt;/a&gt; on 8 October 2009, which kept police in suspense for two hours. The caller, who spoke in &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20language\"&gt;Telugu&lt;/a&gt;, told a telephone operator that a bomb had been planted in the railway station and would explode within an hour. The CMP police alerted their Hyderabad counterparts, who rushed to the station and began a search for explosives. Local police, bomb-disposal squads and railway police scoured the entire station (and its trains) but found nothing, and the call was declared a hoax.\nThe station has a large car and motorcycle parking lot, and an &lt;a href=\"auto%20rickshaw\"&gt;auto rickshaw&lt;/a&gt; stand is at the station entrance. The south entrance has a &lt;a href=\"taxi%20stand\"&gt;taxi stand&lt;/a&gt; for municipal and private taxis. Secunderabad is India's first railway station with an automated parking system. The lot, built at a cost of 6\u00a0million, has a dispenser at its entrance to issue a &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20stripe%20card\"&gt;magnetically-striped&lt;/a&gt; ticket with the time and date of arrival. A manual pay station is at the exit.\nSecunderabad Junction has two ticket counters. Passengers can buy second- and general-class tickets on the train, since they are not reservable. A computerized reservation facility is provided, and an information counter for tourists. A Passenger Operated Enquiry Terminal (POET) is available, which can access the National Train Enquiry System (NTES). &lt;a href=\"Indrail%20Pass\"&gt;Indrail Pass&lt;/a&gt;es are available at the reservation center, about 200 meters from the station.\nTo conserve water, SCR installed a 12-million &lt;a href=\"Reclaimed%20water\"&gt;water-reclamation&lt;/a&gt; plant at the station. Station maintenance, including cleaning 800 &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28rail%29\"&gt;coaches&lt;/a&gt;, aprons and platforms, requires over 30,000 litres of water daily. With the water-recycling plant, used water is collected and sent to the plant for &lt;a href=\"biological\"&gt;biological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chemical\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; treatment. The non-drinkable, recycled water is then used to clean coaches and platforms.\nFuture.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 Indian Railways budget session, Railway Minister &lt;a href=\"Lalu%20Prasad%20Yadav\"&gt;Lalu Prasad Yadav&lt;/a&gt; unveiled a design to improve the two-century-old Secunderabad Junction station at an estimated cost of 40 billion (est.$1 billion). In the 2009\u201310 budget hearing, &lt;a href=\"Mamata%20Banerjee\"&gt;Mamata Banerjee&lt;/a&gt; listed 50 stations (including Secunderabad) to upgrade to world-class facilities. According to the Rail Ministry, the upgrade would be similar to (Rome's central rail station). Chief Minister &lt;a href=\"Y.S.%20Rajasekhara%20Reddy\"&gt;Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy&lt;/a&gt; proposed developing the Gandhi Hospital land adjoining the station along the lines of &lt;a href=\"Union%20Station%20%28Toronto%29\"&gt;Toronto's Union Station&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed into a major commuter &lt;a href=\"train%20station%23Terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial hub and a parking facility.\nSimilar to an airport, the proposed station would have a shopping mall, a food plaza, entertainment and &lt;a href=\"recreation\"&gt;recreation&lt;/a&gt; centres. The plan includes &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20direction\"&gt;vertical&lt;/a&gt; expansion of the station, with platforms on several floors connected by escalators and lifts. Separation of arriving and departing commuters and integration of the proposed &lt;a href=\"Bus%20terminus\"&gt;integrated bus terminus&lt;/a&gt; (IBT) and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20transit\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; service will be key ingredients of the upgrade. The station's current security apparatus might be overhauled. Lighting, seating areas, waiting rooms, bathrooms and Internet kiosks would be upgraded.\nSince about 170,000 passengers commute through Secunderabad on 229 trains daily, the project needs to be developed with an eye to the next century; Union Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee concurred in June 2009, when she presented the maiden 2009\u201310 Rail Budget.\nPreservationists fear that the massive upgrade may leave the heritage building a memory of a bygone era, since 85\u00a0million has already been spent on station improvements.\nA series of meetings was convened with Railway Board authorities in July 2009. It was decided to hire a consultant to sketch a master plan for the project, including facilities to be incorporated, a time frame and estimated cost. Global tenders for consultants were issued on 26 September, and the successful bidder (who would have ten months to propose a master plan) would be selected on 30 October. The &lt;a href=\"request%20for%20tender\"&gt;request for tender&lt;/a&gt; deadline was extended to 24 December and then indefinitely, due to a lack of bidders.\nThe station's south side is planned for development with a number of facilities. A new building is being designed with four floors, of which the first and second have been completed at a cost of 22\u00a0million. In the 2009\u201310 Rail Budget, Union Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee introduced a non-stop Duronto Express from Secunderabad to ."
