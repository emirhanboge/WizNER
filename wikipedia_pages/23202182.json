    "text": "' or ' (&lt;a href=\"Middle%20French\"&gt;Middle French&lt;/a&gt; for 'mallet game', or sometimes interpreted as 'straw game') is a now-obsolete &lt;a href=\"lawn%20game\"&gt;lawn game&lt;/a&gt; originating in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and mostly played in France, surviving in some locales into the 20th century. It is a form of &lt;a href=\"ground%20billiards\"&gt;ground billiards&lt;/a&gt;, using one or more &lt;a href=\"ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;s, a stick with a &lt;a href=\"mallet\"&gt;mallet&lt;/a&gt;-like head, and usually featuring one or more targets such as hoops or holes. \"\" was ancestral to the games &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"palle-malle\"&gt;palle-malle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"croquet\"&gt;croquet&lt;/a&gt;, and (by moving it indoors and playing on a table with smaller equipment), &lt;a href=\"Cue%20sports\"&gt;billiards&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first known written record of \"\" is a &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Latin\"&gt;Renaissance Latin&lt;/a&gt; text dating to 1416. The in the name probably means '&lt;a href=\"Post%20maul\"&gt;maul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mallet\"&gt;mallet&lt;/a&gt;', from &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; . An alternative meaning of 'straw' has been suggested (&lt;a href=\"Modern%20French\"&gt;Modern French&lt;/a&gt; ), on the basis that the target hoops used in some versions of the game were sometimes made of bound straw.\nQuite popular in various forms in France and Italy in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Late Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, the game developed into &lt;a href=\"pall-mall\"&gt;pall-mall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt;, which spread to &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; then &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;; this, in turn, eventually led to &lt;a href=\"croquet\"&gt;croquet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20de%20Bourdeille%2C%20seigneur%20de%20Brant%C3%B4me\"&gt;Brant\u00f4me&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry II of France&lt;/a&gt; (ruled 1547\u20131559) was an excellent player of and (a form of that eventually developed into &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"racquet%20sport\"&gt;racquet sport&lt;/a&gt;s). &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; (ruled 1661\u20131715), who hated , was on the other hand enthusiastic about , and the playing court in the gardens of &lt;a href=\"Tuileries%20Palace\"&gt;Tuileries Palace&lt;/a&gt; was enlarged during his reign.\nThe game was still played in France, in the areas of &lt;a href=\"Montpellier\"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aix-en-Provence\"&gt;Aix-en-Provence&lt;/a&gt;, into the early 20th century, before the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. An educational institution in Montpellier, &lt;a href=\"Coll%C3%A8ge%20Jeu%20de%20Mail\"&gt;Coll\u00e8ge Jeu de Mail&lt;/a&gt;, still bears the name of this game.\nGame play.\nThe game makes use of one or more balls that are generally of &lt;a href=\"Buxus%20sempervirens\"&gt;boxwood&lt;/a&gt;, but higher-quality balls are of &lt;a href=\"medlar\"&gt;medlar&lt;/a&gt;. The ball is struck with a long stick with a mallet- or &lt;a href=\"foot\"&gt;foot&lt;/a&gt;-like end, similar to a croquet mallet or &lt;a href=\"Golf%20club%20%28equipment%29\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt;, respectively; it is essentially a heavy version of the &lt;a href=\"Cue%20sports\"&gt;billiard&lt;/a&gt; (which eventually developed into the &lt;a href=\"cue%20stick\"&gt;cue stick&lt;/a&gt;). Different variants of the game may have differing goals or targets (if any), ranging from croquet-like hoops to golf-like holes in the ground. There are four known named rules variations of the game:"
