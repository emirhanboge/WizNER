    "text": "Amaranta G\u00f3mez Regalado (born 1977) is a Mexican &lt;a href=\"Muxe\"&gt;Muxe&lt;/a&gt; social anthropologist, political candidate, &lt;a href=\"HIV\"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; prevention activist, social researcher, columnist and promoter of &lt;a href=\"pre-Columbian\"&gt;pre-Columbian&lt;/a&gt; indigenous cultural identity.\nBiography.\nG\u00f3mez was born in 1977 in a &lt;a href=\"Zapotec%20civilization\"&gt;Zapotec&lt;/a&gt; village close to the border of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; and adopted the name of Amaranta during adolescence, after reading \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;\", the famous work of Colombian writer &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez\"&gt;Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring high school, G\u00f3mez Regalado studied languages and theater in &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;. She then traveled to several states in southern Mexico as part of a &lt;a href=\"transvestism\"&gt;transvestism&lt;/a&gt; show.\nIn October 2002, a car accident fractured her left arm to such an extent that it had to be amputated.\nIn 2015 she managed to change her &lt;a href=\"gender%20identity\"&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; on her birth certificate, which allowed her to change other official documents such as a passport. This was possible from the reforms approved by what was once the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Mexico%20City\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; to allow people to legally change their gender identity in their birth certificate, through only an administrative procedure. (See &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20Mexico%23Gender%20identity%20and%20expression\"&gt;LGBT rights in Mexico#Gender identity and expression&lt;/a&gt;.)\nShe studied social anthropology at the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20Veracruzana\"&gt;University of Veracruz&lt;/a&gt; between 2011 and 2016. Her undergraduate thesis was titled \"Guendaranaxhii: the Muxe community of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the emotional erotic relations\".\nActivism.\nAt the age of 25, she gained international prominence as a candidate for the &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9xico%20Posible\"&gt;M\u00e9xico Posible&lt;/a&gt; party in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Mexican%20elections\"&gt;2003 elections&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Federal Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Her broad platform included calls for the decriminalization of marijuana and abortion. Regalado did not win a seat.\nRecognition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Escuela%20Amaranta%20G%C3%B3mez%20Regalado\"&gt;Escuela Amaranta G\u00f3mez Regalado&lt;/a&gt; in Santiago, Chile is named for her."
