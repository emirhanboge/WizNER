During this time, he was involved in leading the Namibian response to the &lt;a href=\"Caprivi%20conflict\"&gt;1999 Caprivi Succession&lt;/a&gt; movement. In an &lt;a href=\"Amnesty%20International\"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; report, Nghimtina is quoted as acknowledging that security forces had \"made some mistakes regarding human rights abuses\" in the handling of the situation.\nFrom 2005, he was appointed the Minister of Mines and Energy in President &lt;a href=\"Hifikepunye%20Pohamba\"&gt;Hifikepunye Pohamba&lt;/a&gt;'s cabinet.

He served until 2020 when he was not reappointed to &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Namibia\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical stances.\nIn 2001, while speaking in the &lt;a href=\"Kavango%20Region\"&gt;Kavango Region&lt;/a&gt; as Minister of Defence, Nghimtina denounced and threatened Namibian collaborators with the Angolan rebel group &lt;a href=\"UNITA\"&gt;UNITA&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Angolan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Angolan Civil War&lt;/a&gt; was coming to a close. He said that the Military of Namibia would not allow people to die because collaborators were Namibians.\nNghimtina consistently opposed the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, slamming it both immediately prior to and a year into it as a move by powerful nations to impose their will on weaker ones.\n2008 controversy.\nIn September 2008, Nghimtina was accused of aiming a firearm at a young relative and firing a shot in his direction. He allegedly did this because the teenager had joined the opposition &lt;a href=\"Rally%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Progress%20%28Namibia%29\"&gt;Rally for Democracy and Progress&lt;/a&gt; (RDP). At a press conference held by RDP following the events, &lt;a href=\"Jesaya%20Nyamu\"&gt;Jesaya Nyamu&lt;/a&gt;, acting secretary of the party, called it an attempted murder.\nFollowing a press conference, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Namibia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hifikepunye%20Pohamba\"&gt;Hifikepunye Pohamba&lt;/a&gt; called Nghimtina into the &lt;a href=\"State%20House%20of%20Namibia\"&gt;State House&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the matter, which led to Nghimtina's forced resignation from both the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20Namibia\"&gt;National Assembly of Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and his ministerial position. However, following a meeting of high-level government and party officials including SWAPO secretary &lt;a href=\"Pendukeni%20Iivula-Ithana\"&gt;Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana&lt;/a&gt;, the minister was recalled to the State House and reprimanded, allowing him to retain his office. Shortly thereafter, Nghimtina was interrogated by Namibian police concerning the shooting. Infuriated by the interrogation, he resigned again. On 2 September, Nghimtina told \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Namibian\"&gt;The Namibian&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper that he had not resigned and other party officials called his resignation just speculation. President Pohamba left for &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; for the state funeral of President &lt;a href=\"Levy%20Mwanawasa\"&gt;Levy Mwanawasa&lt;/a&gt; and was unable to immediately clear up the confusion. The next day, it was reported that Nghimtina had withdrawn his letter of resignation and returned to his post after prominent SWAPO leadership other than president Pohamba over-ruled Pohamba's dismissal.\nPersonal life.\nNghimtina has 13 children; 8 daughters and 5 sons."
