    "text": "The Mulberry Home Economics Building is a historic school building in &lt;a href=\"Mulberry%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Mulberry, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. It is a single-story stone and masonry structure, located off West 5th Street behind the current Mulberry High School building. It has a rectangular plan, with a gable-on-hip roof and a projecting gable-roof entry pavilion on the north side near the western end. The pavilion exhibits modest Craftsman styling, with exposed rafters in the roof and arched openings. The south facade has a secondary entrance near the eastern end, and four irregularly sized and spaced window bays to its west. The building was erected in 1939 with funding assistance from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Youth%20Administration\"&gt;National Youth Administration&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1992."
