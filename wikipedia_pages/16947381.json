It covers and contains several flower gardens, two children's playgrounds, a skateboard/&lt;a href=\"BMX\"&gt;BMX&lt;/a&gt; park and &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; fields.\nThe arts and music festival Village Green is held on the grounds of Chalkwell Park annually in the summer. The festival often receives more than 25,000 visitors each year.\nHistory.\nIn 1830, Chalkwell Hall was built in the centre of the park. At the time, it didn't have a well-defined purpose. The park was formed from the land surrounding the hall. In 1901 or 1903, the &lt;a href=\"Southend-on-Sea%20Borough%20Council\"&gt;Southend-on-Sea Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; purchased the land for \u00a320,000.\nIn the 1950s or earlier, a small petting zoo was established in Chalkwell Hall containing at various points in time &lt;a href=\"peacocks\"&gt;peacocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monkeys\"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and eventually a &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;. Today, only the peacock enclosure remains, containing 4 peacocks. The hall also serves as a &lt;a href=\"modern%20art\"&gt;modern art&lt;/a&gt; house. Chalkwell Hall was designated as a Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt; in 1974.\nCricket ground.\nThe cricket ground was first used by the &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Essex County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;, 1st XI in 1934 for &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship\"&gt;County Championship&lt;/a&gt; matches and in 1970 for &lt;a href=\"List%20A\"&gt;List A&lt;/a&gt; matches. The ground has not been used by the club 1st XI since 1976.\nThe ground has hosted 69 &lt;a href=\"First%20class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class&lt;/a&gt; matches and 8 &lt;a href=\"List%20A\"&gt;List A&lt;/a&gt; matches:"
