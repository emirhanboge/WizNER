Len was nominated for a 2000 &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Award\"&gt;Juno Award&lt;/a&gt; as best new group, and the album was nominated as Best Alternative Album.\nAt one point, the band's lineup included &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Canning\"&gt;Brendan Canning&lt;/a&gt;, who co-founded the indie rock band &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Social%20Scene\"&gt;Broken Social Scene&lt;/a&gt; shortly after leaving Len.\nLen produced no further hits, but continued to release albums until 2005, followed by a seven-year hiatus.\nThe group became active again in 2011. The following year the group released a music video, \"It's My Neighbourhood\", and an album \"It's Easy if You Try\"."
