    "text": "This is a list of the bird species recorded in Nicaragua. The avifauna of &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; included a total of 783 species as of May 2021, according to \"Bird Checklists of the World\". Of them, 140 are rare or &lt;a href=\"Accidental%20%28biology%29\"&gt;accidental&lt;/a&gt; and five have been &lt;a href=\"Introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; by humans. None are &lt;a href=\"Endemism%20in%20birds\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis list is presented in the &lt;a href=\"taxonomic%20sequence\"&gt;taxonomic sequence&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Check-list of North and Middle American Birds\", 7th edition through the 62nd Supplement, published by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Ornithological%20Society\"&gt;American Ornithological Society&lt;/a&gt; (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the \"Check-list\", except that the common names of families are from the &lt;a href=\"Clements%20taxonomy\"&gt;Clements taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; because the AOS list does not include them.\nUnless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in Nicaragua as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from \"Bird Checklists of the World\".\nTinamous.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Tinamiformes\"&gt;Tinamiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Tinamidae\"&gt;Tinamidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the &lt;a href=\"ratites\"&gt;ratites&lt;/a&gt; (order &lt;a href=\"Struthioniformes\"&gt;Struthioniformes&lt;/a&gt;), that includes the &lt;a href=\"Rhea%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rhea&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emu\"&gt;emu&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Kiwi%20%28bird%29\"&gt;kiwi&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anatidae\"&gt;Anatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAnatidae includes the &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as &lt;a href=\"Goose\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swan\"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.\nGuans, chachalacas, and curassows.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cracidae\"&gt;Cracidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Cracidae are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.\nNew World quail.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Odontophoridae\"&gt;Odontophoridae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"New%20World%20quail\"&gt;New World quail&lt;/a&gt;s are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.\nGrebes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Podicipediformes\"&gt;Podicipediformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Podicipedidae\"&gt;Podicipedidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grebe\"&gt;Grebe&lt;/a&gt;s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\nPigeons and doves.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Columbiformes\"&gt;Columbiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;Columbidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pigeon\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dove\"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy &lt;a href=\"cere\"&gt;cere&lt;/a&gt;.\nCuckoos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Cuculiformes\"&gt;Cuculiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cuculidae\"&gt;Cuculidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Cuculidae includes &lt;a href=\"cuckoo\"&gt;cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Geococcyx\"&gt;roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Ani%20%28bird%29\"&gt;anis&lt;/a&gt;. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs.\nNightjars and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgidae\"&gt;Caprimulgidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightjar\"&gt;Nightjar&lt;/a&gt;s are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.\nPotoos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Nyctibiiformes\"&gt;Nyctibiiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Nyctibiidae\"&gt;Nyctibiidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe potoos (sometimes called poor-me-ones) are large &lt;a href=\"near%20passerine\"&gt;near passerine&lt;/a&gt; birds related to the nightjars and frogmouths. They are nocturnal insectivores which lack the bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars.\nSwifts.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Apodiformes\"&gt;Apodiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Apodidae\"&gt;Apodidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\nHummingbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Apodiformes\"&gt;Apodiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Trochilidae\"&gt;Trochilidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hummingbird\"&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.\nRails, gallinules, and coots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;Rallidae&lt;/a&gt;\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crake\"&gt;crake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coot\"&gt;coot&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;gallinule&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\nFinfoots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Heliornithidae\"&gt;Heliornithidae&lt;/a&gt;\nHeliornithidae is a small family of tropical birds with webbed lobes on their feet similar to those of grebes and coots.\nLimpkin.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Aramidae\"&gt;Aramidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe limpkin resembles a large rail. It has drab-brown plumage and a grayer head and neck.\nThick-knees.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Burhinidae\"&gt;Burhinidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe thick-knees are a group of largely tropical waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes, and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.\nStilts and avocets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Recurvirostridae\"&gt;Recurvirostridae&lt;/a&gt;\nRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"avocet\"&gt;avocet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stilt\"&gt;stilt&lt;/a&gt;s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.\nOystercatchers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Haematopodidae\"&gt;Haematopodidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"oystercatcher\"&gt;oystercatcher&lt;/a&gt;s are large and noisy &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlovers and lapwings.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Charadriidae\"&gt;Charadriidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Charadriidae includes the &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dotterel\"&gt;dotterel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lapwing\"&gt;lapwing&lt;/a&gt;s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\nJacanas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Jacanidae\"&gt;Jacanidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jacana%20%28genus%29\"&gt;jacana&lt;/a&gt;s are a group of tropical waders. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.\nSandpipers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scolopacidae\"&gt;Scolopacidae&lt;/a&gt;\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the &lt;a href=\"sandpiper\"&gt;sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curlew\"&gt;curlew&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"godwit\"&gt;godwit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tringa\"&gt;shanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tattler%20%28bird%29\"&gt;tattler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodcock\"&gt;woodcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snipe\"&gt;snipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dowitcher\"&gt;dowitcher&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"phalarope\"&gt;phalarope&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\nSkuas and jaegers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Stercorariidae\"&gt;Stercorariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.\nGulls, terns, and skimmers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Laridae\"&gt;Laridae&lt;/a&gt;\nLaridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kittiwake\"&gt;kittiwake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tern\"&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Skimmer%20%28bird%29\"&gt;skimmer&lt;/a&gt;s. They are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small group of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.\nSunbittern.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Eurypygiformes\"&gt;Eurypygiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Eurypygidae\"&gt;Eurypygidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe sunbittern is a &lt;a href=\"bittern\"&gt;bittern&lt;/a&gt;-like bird of tropical regions of the Americas and the sole member of the family Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus \"Eurypyga\".\nTropicbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontiformes\"&gt;Phaethontiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontidae\"&gt;Phaethontidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tropicbird\"&gt;Tropicbird&lt;/a&gt;s are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.\nNorthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Hydrobatidae\"&gt;Hydrobatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"storm%20petrel\"&gt;storm-petrels&lt;/a&gt; are relatives of the &lt;a href=\"petrel\"&gt;petrel&lt;/a&gt;s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on &lt;a href=\"plankton\"&gt;plankton&lt;/a&gt;ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;-like.\nShearwaters and petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Procellariidae\"&gt;Procellariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.\nStorks.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiiformes\"&gt;Ciconiiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiidae\"&gt;Ciconiidae&lt;/a&gt;\nStorks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.\nFrigatebirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Fregatidae\"&gt;Fregatidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Frigatebird\"&gt;Frigatebird&lt;/a&gt;s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\nBoobies and gannets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sulidae\"&gt;Sulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe sulids comprise the &lt;a href=\"gannet\"&gt;gannet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Booby\"&gt;boobies&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\nAnhingas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anhingidae\"&gt;Anhingidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Darters\"&gt;Anhingas&lt;/a&gt; are often called \"snake-birds\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The anhingas have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.\nCormorants and shags.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phalacrocoracidae\"&gt;Phalacrocoracidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPhalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful.\nPelicans.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pelecanidae\"&gt;Pelecanidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pelican\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;s are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes.\nHerons, egrets, and bitterns.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ardeidae\"&gt;Ardeidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Ardeidae contains the &lt;a href=\"bittern\"&gt;bittern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills.\nIbises and spoonbills.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Threskiornithidae\"&gt;Threskiornithidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThreskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"ibis\"&gt;ibis&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"spoonbill\"&gt;spoonbill&lt;/a&gt;s. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.\nNew World vultures.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Cathartiformes\"&gt;Cathartiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cathartidae\"&gt;Cathartidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"New%20World%20vultures\"&gt;New World vultures&lt;/a&gt; are not closely related to &lt;a href=\"Old%20World%20vultures\"&gt;Old World vultures&lt;/a&gt;, but superficially resemble them because of &lt;a href=\"convergent%20evolution\"&gt;convergent evolution&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate &lt;a href=\"carrion\"&gt;carrion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOsprey.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pandionidae\"&gt;Pandionidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Pandionidae contains only one species, the osprey. The osprey is a medium-large &lt;a href=\"bird%20of%20prey\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution.\nHawks, eagles, and kites.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Accipitridae\"&gt;Accipitridae&lt;/a&gt;\nAccipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes &lt;a href=\"hawk\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kite%20%28bird%29\"&gt;kites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrier%20%28bird%29\"&gt;harriers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Old%20World%20vulture\"&gt;Old World vulture&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.\nBarn-owls.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Strigiformes\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Tytonidae\"&gt;Tytonidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Barn%20owl\"&gt;Barn-owls&lt;/a&gt; are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long strong legs with powerful talons.\nOwls.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Strigiformes\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Strigidae\"&gt;Strigidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"typical%20owl\"&gt;typical owl&lt;/a&gt;s are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large forward-facing eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a conspicuous circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.\nTrogons.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Trogoniformes\"&gt;Trogoniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Trogonidae\"&gt;Trogonidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Trogonidae includes trogons and quetzals. Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumages.\nMotmots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Coraciiformes\"&gt;Coraciiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Momotidae\"&gt;Momotidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe motmots have colorful plumage and long, graduated tails which they display by waggling back and forth. In most of the species, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare shaft and creating a racket-shaped tail.\nKingfishers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Coraciiformes\"&gt;Coraciiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Alcedinidae\"&gt;Alcedinidae&lt;/a&gt;\nKingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.\nPuffbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Piciformes\"&gt;Piciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Bucconidae\"&gt;Bucconidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe puffbirds are related to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the iridescent colors of that family. They are mainly brown, &lt;a href=\"rufous\"&gt;rufous&lt;/a&gt;, or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family.\nJacamars.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Piciformes\"&gt;Piciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Galbulidae\"&gt;Galbulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe jacamars are near passerine birds from tropical South America with a range that extends up to Mexico. They feed on insects caught on the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World &lt;a href=\"bee-eater\"&gt;bee-eater&lt;/a&gt;s, although they are more closely related to puffbirds.\nToucans.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Piciformes\"&gt;Piciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ramphastidae\"&gt;Ramphastidae&lt;/a&gt;\nToucans are near-passerine birds from the &lt;a href=\"Neotropics\"&gt;Neotropics&lt;/a&gt;. They are brightly marked and have enormous colorful bills which in some species amount to half their body length.\nWoodpeckers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Piciformes\"&gt;Piciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Picidae\"&gt;Picidae&lt;/a&gt;\nWoodpeckers are small to medium-sized birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have the habit of tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.\nFalcons and caracaras.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Falconiformes\"&gt;Falconiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Falconidae\"&gt;Falconidae&lt;/a&gt;\nFalconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.\nNew World and African parrots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Psittaciformes\"&gt;Psittaciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Psittacidae\"&gt;Psittacidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Parrot\"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt;s are small to large birds with a characteristic curved beak. Their upper mandibles have slight mobility in the joint with the skull and they have a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, having the four toes on each foot placed two at the front and two to the back.\nTypical antbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Thamnophilidae\"&gt;Thamnophilidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe antbirds are a large family of small passerine birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America. They are forest birds which tend to feed on insects at or near the ground. A sizable minority of them specialize in following columns of &lt;a href=\"army%20ant\"&gt;army ant&lt;/a&gt;s to eat small invertebrates that leave their hiding places to flee from the ants. Many species lack bright color, with brown, black, and white being the dominant tones.\nAntpittas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Grallariidae\"&gt;Grallariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAntpittas resemble the true &lt;a href=\"pitta%20%28bird%29\"&gt;pittas&lt;/a&gt; with strong, longish legs, very short tails, and stout bills.\nAntthrushes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Formicariidae\"&gt;Formicariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAntthrushes resemble small rails with strong, longish legs, very short tails and stout bills.\nOvenbirds and woodcreepers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Furnariidae\"&gt;Furnariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nOvenbirds comprise a large family of small &lt;a href=\"sub-oscine\"&gt;sub-oscine&lt;/a&gt; passerine bird species found in Central and South America. They are a diverse group of insectivores which gets its name from the elaborate \"oven-like\" clay nests built by some species, although others build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock. The woodcreepers are brownish birds which maintain an upright vertical posture supported by their stiff tail vanes. They feed mainly on insects taken from tree trunks.\nManakins.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pipridae\"&gt;Pipridae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe manakins are a family of subtropical and tropical mainland Central American, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago. They are compact forest birds, the males typically being brightly colored, although the females of most species are duller and usually green-plumaged. Manakins feed on small fruits, berries, and insects.\nCotingas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cotingidae\"&gt;Cotingidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe cotingas are birds of forests or forest edges in tropical Central and South America.
