    "text": "Kenneth Marvin Schrom (born November 23, 1954) is a former &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major league baseball&lt;/a&gt; pitcher and current minor league executive.\nSelected in the 17th round of the &lt;a href=\"1976%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;1976 MLB amateur draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"California%20Angels\"&gt;California Angels&lt;/a&gt;, Schrom pitched for seven seasons in the majors (1980, 1982\u20131987), for the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Blue%20Jays\"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; (1983\u201385), and &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; (1986\u201387) of the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt;. While with Cleveland, he was selected for the American League &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; team in 1986, but did not play.\nDuring his major league career, Schrom appeared in 176 games with 137 starts and 22 complete games, throwing 900 innings. His record was 51\u201351 with an ERA of 4.81. His playing career ended in the spring of 1989 with a shoulder injury. Schrom remained in baseball, serving in the front office of several minor league clubs. He spent over fifteen years with the &lt;a href=\"El%20Paso%20Diablos\"&gt;El Paso Diablos&lt;/a&gt;, a team he had played with in the late 1970s.\nSchrom is currently the president of the &lt;a href=\"Corpus%20Christi%20Hooks\"&gt;Corpus Christi Hooks&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt;, the AA affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh school and college.\nBorn and raised in &lt;a href=\"Grangeville%2C%20Idaho\"&gt;Grangeville, Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, Schrom graduated from &lt;a href=\"Grangeville%20High%20School\"&gt;Grangeville High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1973, where he won 11 athletic &lt;a href=\"Letterman%20%28sports%29\"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; and was an all-state selection in football, basketball, and baseball. Selected in the tenth round of the &lt;a href=\"1973%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft\"&gt;1973 MLB amateur draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"1973%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;, the right-hander opted for college and accepted a &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20scholarship\"&gt;scholarship&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Idaho\"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow%2C%20Idaho\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to pitch for the &lt;a href=\"Idaho%20Vandals\"&gt;Vandals&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Idaho%20Vandals%20baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; and play &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Idaho%20Vandals%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team.\nSchrom was the back-up QB as a &lt;a href=\"Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29\"&gt;redshirt&lt;/a&gt; sophomore in &lt;a href=\"1975%20Idaho%20Vandals%20football%20team\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;, coached by &lt;a href=\"offensive%20coordinator\"&gt;offensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Erickson\"&gt;Dennis Erickson&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"head%20coach\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Troxel\"&gt;Ed Troxel&lt;/a&gt;. An excellent pure passer, he had to forego spring football practice to play baseball. At the time, Idaho ran the &lt;a href=\"veer\"&gt;veer&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"option%20offense\"&gt;option offense&lt;/a&gt; which exposed the quarterback to continual contact with the defense. After hurting his left (non-throwing) shoulder in football, Schrom did not want to hurt his right and turned pro after his junior year of baseball (spring 1976). He is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Sigma%20Phi\"&gt;Delta Sigma Phi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fraternities%20and%20sororities\"&gt;fraternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchrom completed his degree in education in increments during the baseball off-season and graduated in 1980."
