Her mother, Elaine (\"n\u00e9e\" McAlpin), worked as a talent scout, and her father, &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Lively\"&gt;Ernie Lively&lt;/a&gt; (\"n\u00e9\" Ernest Wilson Brown Jr.; d. 2021), was an actor. Lively was named after her grandmother's brother. She has an older brother, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Lively\"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;, and three half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage, &lt;a href=\"Lori%20Lively\"&gt;Lori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robyn%20Lively\"&gt;Robyn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Lively\"&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;. Her parents and siblings have all worked in the &lt;a href=\"entertainment%20industry\"&gt;entertainment industry&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring her childhood, Lively accompanied her parents to the acting classes they taught, as they did not want to leave her with a babysitter. She said that watching her parents teach helped her learn the \"drills\" and gain confidence as she got older and began working in the industry. She made her professional debut at age 10, when she appeared in the 1998 film \"Sandman\", directed by Lively's father. She describes her role as a \"bit part\". She was initially not particularly interested in acting and wanted to attend &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe attended &lt;a href=\"Burbank%20High%20School%20%28Burbank%2C%20California%29\"&gt;Burbank High School&lt;/a&gt;, where she was a cheerleader, a member of the championship choir, and class president. Her elder brother asked his talent agent to send her on a few auditions during the summer months. She was subsequently cast as Bridget in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Traveling%20Pants%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005) and filmed her scenes between her junior and senior years of high school.\nCareer.\n2005\u20132006: Career beginnings.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Traveling%20Pants%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 2005.

Lively starred in \"&lt;a href=\"Elvis%20and%20Anabelle\"&gt;Elvis and Anabelle&lt;/a&gt;\" (2007) as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. Lively said &lt;a href=\"Method%20acting\"&gt;of getting into character for the role&lt;/a&gt; that she had \"shed serious weight\" for her height.

Already having deferred college for a year, Lively intended to turn the role down and become a student, but was told that she could attend college part-time while filming the show (she later said \"This is advice to anyone: when they say, 'We promise, but we can't put it in writing,' there's a reason they can't put it in writing\").

Despite positive critical reception, the film failed at the box office.\nLively portrayed the younger version of the titlular character in \"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee\" (2009) to critical acclaim.
