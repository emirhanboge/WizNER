    "text": "Berks, Bucks and Oxon Division 2 is an English &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; league featuring teams from &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckinghamshire\"&gt;Buckinghamshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire\"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt;. As with all of the divisions in this area at this level, the entire league is made up of second and third teams of clubs whose first teams play at a higher level of the rugby union pyramid. Promoted teams move up to &lt;a href=\"Berks/Bucks%20%26amp%3B%20Oxon%201\"&gt;Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 1&lt;/a&gt; while relegated teams drop to &lt;a href=\"Berks/Bucks%20%26amp%3B%20Oxon%203\"&gt;Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe division was created in 2004-05 as part of a complete overhaul of the Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon league, with a large number of 2nd, 3rd and 4th teams entering at various levels, and was divided into north and south regions, becoming the third division of the league structure with promoted teams going into &lt;a href=\"Berks/Bucks%20%26amp%3B%20Oxon%201\"&gt;Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 1&lt;/a&gt; and there being no relegation. Further league restructuring in 2011 saw Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 2 become one league instead of two regional divisions and newly created divisions below it meant that relegation was introduced. Changes above the division meant that 1st teams were split from 2nd, 3rd and 4th teams and &lt;a href=\"Berks/Bucks%20%26amp%3B%20Oxon%201\"&gt;Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 1&lt;/a&gt; was the furthest teams in Berks/Bucks &amp; Oxon 2 and below could go in the system."
