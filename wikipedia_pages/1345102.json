Built in 1993, the stadium was originally named and has the capacity of 38,585 seats. With a diameter of 216 meters, the Fukuoka PayPay Dome is the world's largest geodesic dome. This is Japan's first stadium built with a &lt;a href=\"retractable%20roof\"&gt;retractable roof&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, &lt;a href=\"Yahoo%21%20JAPAN\"&gt;Yahoo! JAPAN&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"SoftBank\"&gt;SoftBank&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"subsidiary\"&gt;subsidiaries&lt;/a&gt;, acquired the stadium's &lt;a href=\"naming%20rights\"&gt;naming rights&lt;/a&gt;, and thus renamed it or abbreviated as , In January 2013, it was renamed to . Yafuoku is the abbreviation for &lt;a href=\"Yahoo%21%20Auctions\"&gt;Yahoo! Auctions&lt;/a&gt; in Japan. On October 30, 2019, it was announced that the stadium was going to be named Fukuoka PayPay Dome, in reference to the payment system &lt;a href=\"PayPay\"&gt;PayPay&lt;/a&gt; owned by Softbank (50%) and Yahoo Japan (25%), from February 29, 2020.\nHistory.\nFukuoka Dome is the home stadium of &lt;a href=\"Fukuoka%20SoftBank%20Hawks\"&gt;Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks&lt;/a&gt; and, together with &lt;a href=\"Hilton%20Hotel\"&gt;Hilton&lt;/a&gt; Fukuoka Sea Hawk Hotel, is part of the Hawks Town entertainment complex. It is located near &lt;a href=\"Sawara-ku%2C%20Fukuoka\"&gt;Momochi Beach&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 minutes walk from &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Djinmachi%20Station\"&gt;Tojinmachi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fukuoka%20City%20Subway\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; station.\nIn 2006, the stadium received an upgrade to its mono-color main scoreboard \"Hawks Vision.\" Sharing the same nickname as its predecessor and measured at 10\u00a0m (32.76\u00a0ft) high and 53\u00a0m (173.86\u00a0ft) wide, it was one of the largest high-definition electronic scoreboards at the time, equivalent to a 2,123-inch wide-screen display. In 2010, with further addition of two 5.7\u00a0m (120.65\u00a0ft) \u00d7 33\u00a0m (108.27\u00a0ft) displays, the stadium boasted the largest total viewing area of HD display in all baseball stadia (total area 905.2sqm or 9,743.49sqft).\nThe Fukuoka Dome has hosted one game in each &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Japan%20All-Star%20Series\"&gt;Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series&lt;/a&gt; since its creation, including the final game of the 2006 series, where Japan was swept for the first time in the history of the event.\nIn the TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Extreme%20Engineering\"&gt;Extreme Engineering&lt;/a&gt;\", Danny Forster makes a reference to the Fukuoka Dome, saying it was said to have a \"floating\" field. (An indoor baseball stadium in Japan which actually has a floating field is &lt;a href=\"Sapporo%20Dome\"&gt;Sapporo Dome&lt;/a&gt;, which also hosts &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games for &lt;a href=\"Consadole%20Sapporo\"&gt;Consadole Sapporo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"J.%20League\"&gt;J. League&lt;/a&gt; club. However, this stadium does not have such a field.) In 2009, the older &lt;a href=\"AstroTurf\"&gt;AstroTurf&lt;/a&gt; field was replaced with the now more common &lt;a href=\"FieldTurf\"&gt;FieldTurf&lt;/a&gt; brand surface to reduce injuries; the Hawks players had seen far more injuries than any other team in Japan.\nNotable Events.\nNPB.\nOn May 18, 1994, &lt;a href=\"Hiromi%20Makihara\"&gt;Hiromi Makihara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt; threw a &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20game%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Hiroshima%20Toyo%20Carp\"&gt;Hiroshima Toyo Carp&lt;/a&gt; as the Giants won 6\u20130. Makihara's first Perfect-game at Fukuoka Dome is of special note as it being the only one thrown there, as well as the last one in the NPB(15th overall), through the 2020 season.\nConcerts.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson\"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; performed at the stadium four times during his solo career.
