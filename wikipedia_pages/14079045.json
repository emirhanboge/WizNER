    "text": "Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball is the men's &lt;a href=\"college%20basketball\"&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt; team that represents &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20State%20University\"&gt;Cleveland State University&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to rebranding from &lt;a href=\"Fenn%20College\"&gt;Fenn College&lt;/a&gt;, they were known as the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20State%20Vikings\"&gt;Fenn College Foxes&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland State has been in &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; since 1972. They are a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20League\"&gt;Horizon League&lt;/a&gt; (1994\u2013present) Cleveland State was formerly in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Summit%20League\"&gt;Mid-Continent Conference&lt;/a&gt; (1982\u20131994). Prior to 1982, Cleveland State was an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20basketball%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; program.\nHistory.\nThe 1985\u201386 season is arguably the most memorable in Vikings history, as they achieved the improbable in becoming the first ever 14th seeded team to make it to the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;Sweet Sixteen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"1986%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;1986 NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Coach &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Mackey\"&gt;Kevin Mackey&lt;/a&gt;'s squad, led by &lt;a href=\"Ken%20McFadden\"&gt;Ken 'Mouse' McFadden&lt;/a&gt; and Eric Mudd, upset &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Knight\"&gt;Bobby Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s 3rd seeded &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Indiana Hoosiers&lt;/a&gt;, by a final of 83-79. Following a 75-69 second round win against 6th seeded &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%27s%20University\"&gt;St.Joseph's&lt;/a&gt;, the Vikings would ultimately lose to &lt;a href=\"Navy%20Midshipmen%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; 71-70 on a clutch basket in the waning seconds by future &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;David Robinson&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland State would qualify for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Invitation%20Tournament\"&gt;NIT&lt;/a&gt; Tournament the following two seasons, but went 23 seasons until returning to the NCAA Tournament.\nOn Monday, December 15, 2008, Cleveland State had their biggest regular season victory in school history, upsetting the #11 &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20Orange%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Syracuse Orange&lt;/a&gt;, 72-69, on a last-second, three-quarter court shot from senior guard Cedric Jackson. It was CSU's third-ever win over a &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;Top 25&lt;/a&gt; ranked opponent, and first ever on the road. They would pick up their fourth and fifth wins over Top 25 opponents later that same season when they won at #17 Butler in the championship game of the Horizon League Tournament 57-54, and then in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;2009 NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; when, as the 13th seeded team in the Midwest bracket, they routed 4th seeded and #12 &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Wake Forest&lt;/a&gt; by a final score of 84-69.\nRecords.\nRecord versus Horizon League.\nRecords vs. Horizon League schools as of the end of the 2020\u20132021 school year.\nRecord versus Ohio schools.\nRecords vs. Ohio schools as of the end of the 2015\u20132016 school year.\nAwards.\nAMCU/Mid Continent Player of the Year\nAMCU/Mid Continent Coach of the Year\nAMCU/Mid Continent Newcomer of the Year\nHorizon League Player of the Year\nHorizon League Newcomer of the Year\nHorizon League Defensive Player of the Year\nHorizon League Sixth Man of the Year\nHorizon League Coach of the Year\nHoopDirt.com Division I Coach of the Year\nAttendance.\nNBA Draft history.\nRegular Draft\nPostseason history.\nNCAA Division I Tournament history.\nCleveland State has made three appearances in the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, having a record of 3\u20133.\nNIT results.\nCleveland State has appeared in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Invitation%20Tournament\"&gt;National Invitation Tournament&lt;/a&gt; five times, with the Vikings having a record of 3\u20135.\nCIT results.\nCleveland State has appeared in the &lt;a href=\"CollegeInsider.com%20Postseason%20Tournament\"&gt;CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament&lt;/a&gt; twice, having a combined record of 1\u20132.\nRetired numbers.\nCleveland State has retired three numbers in program history.\nHead Coaching History.\nRegular Season\nTournament\nAlumni in the National Basketball Association.\nSix Cleveland State alumni have played in the NBA, including:"
