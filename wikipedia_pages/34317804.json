    "text": "Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen I was the first known &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ajaw\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Calakmul\"&gt;the Kaan Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. He was maybe a father of King &lt;a href=\"Tuun%20K%CA%BCab%CA%BC%20Hix\"&gt;Tuun K\u02bcab\u02bc Hix&lt;/a&gt;.\nIdentity.\nAlthough nineteen &lt;a href=\"Maya%20rulers\"&gt;Kaan kings&lt;/a&gt; are listed on the &lt;a href=\"Dynasty\"&gt;Dynastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vase\"&gt;Vase&lt;/a&gt;s, some with the names of known historical rulers, clear discrepancies in their accession dates make it uncertain whether the nineteen names are to be considered historical or &lt;a href=\"Mythological%20king\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt;. Thus Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen can be said to be the first known, clearly historical ruler of Kaan.\nThat kingdom's location in Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen's time \u2014 roughly the years around AD 500 \u2014 is not certain; although &lt;a href=\"Calakmul\"&gt;Calakmul&lt;/a&gt; is known to have been the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20city\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology\"&gt;Late Classic&lt;/a&gt;, there is a reason to doubt that this was the case earlier. &lt;a href=\"Dzibanche\"&gt;Dzibanche&lt;/a&gt; emerges as a strong possibility for the previous center because Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen is repeatedly named there on a sculptured \"captive stairway\". Although this monument's interpretation hinges on a single problematic &lt;a href=\"Maya%20script\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely that Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen was a ruler of Dzibanche and the &lt;a href=\"Hostage\"&gt;captives&lt;/a&gt; were his trophies."
