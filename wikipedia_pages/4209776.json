Although small by international standards, it is the largest stadium in Cyprus, with a capacity of 22,859 and was opened in 1999. It serves as the home stadium for the 3 biggest clubs of Nicosia &lt;a href=\"APOEL%20FC\"&gt;APOEL&lt;/a&gt;, Olympiakos &amp; &lt;a href=\"AC%20Omonia\"&gt;Omonia&lt;/a&gt; . It is also the home stadium of the &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cyprus national football team&lt;/a&gt;. A stadium under the same name, the &lt;a href=\"GSP%20Stadium%20%281902%29\"&gt;old GSP Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, existed from 1902 until 1999 in the centre of Nicosia and had a capacity of 12,000.\nHistory.\nDesigned by Theo. David Architects, the new GSP Stadium opened for use on 6 October 1999. The complex has three arenas: a football stadium, an athletics stadium and an auxiliary football pitch intended for training. The stadium is owned by the &lt;a href=\"Pancyprian%20Gymnastic%20Association\"&gt;Pancyprian Gymnastic Association&lt;/a&gt;. With an official &lt;a href=\"seating%20capacity\"&gt;seating capacity&lt;/a&gt; of 22,859 the new GSP is the largest football venue in Cyprus. It is located at the entrance to Nicosia (as approached from the &lt;a href=\"A1%20motorway%20%28Cyprus%29\"&gt;A1 highway&lt;/a&gt;) and was inaugurated in 1999 by the then-President &lt;a href=\"Glafcos%20Clerides\"&gt;Glafcos Clerides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Chrysostomos%20I\"&gt;Archbishop Chrysostomos I&lt;/a&gt;. The first game was held on 6 October 1999 and there was a friendly match between &lt;a href=\"APOEL%20FC\"&gt;APOEL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AC%20Omonia\"&gt;Omonia&lt;/a&gt;, which ended 3\u20133.\nSince then, the stadium is not only the home of Nicosian teams but usually of Cyprus national football team. During the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;World Cup 2006 qualifying round&lt;/a&gt; it was used as home for all matches of Cyprus. The stadium is the only one in Cyprus which satisfies UEFA Criteria. For this reason since 2004 it is used as home for all the teams of Cyprus in European Cups. Annually, the stadium hosts the &lt;a href=\"Cypriot%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;Cypriot Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Also until 2005, it was hosting annually the &lt;a href=\"Cypriot%20Cup\"&gt;Cypriot Cup&lt;/a&gt; final.\nIn 2002, the stadium was home for &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i clubs for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; matches. It hosted the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; quarter final (as home for Hapoel Tel Aviv) between &lt;a href=\"Hapoel%20Tel%20Aviv%20FC\"&gt;Hapoel Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt;. It was also used by &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Haifa%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Haifa&lt;/a&gt; for home stadium for the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League group stage&lt;/a&gt; matches and for the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; matches. Some matches were attractive for Cypriots like the matches Maccabi Haifa-&lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos CFP&lt;/a&gt; and Maccabi Haifa-&lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, since those two Maccabi's rivals are very popular in Cyprus.\nIt's the only stadium in Cyprus build only for track &amp; field games. In addition with the hotel, it provides a full training centre solution for athletes all over the world. During the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Athens 2004 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, many athletes from different countries used the stadium for training. In 2001, Bruno Zauli took place here with great success.\nThe GSP Stadium hosted all home matches of &lt;a href=\"Anorthosis%20Famagusta%20FC\"&gt;Anorthosis Famagusta's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; campaign and all &lt;a href=\"APOEL%20FC\"&gt;APOEL's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; home matches.
