    "text": "Number 96 is an Australian television &lt;a href=\"soap%20opera\"&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt;/serial that broadcast from March 1972 to August 1977. It screened week nights in the &lt;a href=\"prime%20time\"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt; 8.30 pm slot and was one of the most popular Australian TV series of the 1970s.\nCreated by &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Harmon%20Television\"&gt;Cash Harmon Television&lt;/a&gt;, the production firm of Don Cash and Bill Harmon for the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Network\"&gt;Ten Network&lt;/a&gt; (known then as the 0-10 Network that were lagging between the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Network\"&gt;Nine Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Network\"&gt;Seven Network&lt;/a&gt; ratings), requesting a similar localised version of long established British soap opera \"&lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Street\"&gt;Coronation Street&lt;/a&gt;\", and one that explored adult subject matter.\n\"Number 96\" became famous for its adult storylines, nude glimpses, and comedy characters, as well as its &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Christie\"&gt;Agatha Christie&lt;/a&gt;-style whodunnit story arcs. There were many controversial storylines and firsts, including the world's first gay character, an interracial romance, and other taboo subjects that were not being addressed at that time in America.\nStorylines explored the lives and relationships of a four-story apartment block in Sydney, at 96 Lindsay Street, Paddington.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Russell%2C%2013th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Russell%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Bedford\"&gt;Duchess of Bedford&lt;/a&gt; visited the set and appeared in a &lt;a href=\"Cameo%20appearance\"&gt;cameo&lt;/a&gt; in the series, in a storyline in which they come to visit Baroness Amanda Von Pappernburg (played by &lt;a href=\"Carol%20Raye\"&gt;Carol Raye&lt;/a&gt;).\nCult status.\n\"Number 96\" was the first Australian soap opera/serial to gain a significant &lt;a href=\"cult%20following\"&gt;cult following&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the network's internationally successful series \"&lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;\". It led to tie-in books and novels, merchandising, a 1974 feature film also called \"&lt;a href=\"Number%2096%20%28film%29\"&gt;Number 96&lt;/a&gt;\", and a short-lived 1980 American remake.\nWhen the series started its cast was one of the largest ever assembled for a local production. When it ended after 1218 episodes it was the longest running soap opera produced in Australia, having surpassed the ABC series \"&lt;a href=\"Bellbird%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Bellbird&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Number 96\" was surpassed by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Young%20Doctors\"&gt;The Young Doctors&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1982.\nAt the series' height New York newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" stated it was one of the highest rating programs of its kind in the world.\nWhen the stars travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via train to attend the &lt;a href=\"Logie%20Awards\"&gt;Logie Awards&lt;/a&gt; ceremony they were mobbed at stations during whistle stops. Crowds in Melbourne were greater in number than those that met &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles%27%201964%20world%20tour\"&gt;their only Australian tour in 1964&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst the program was extremely popular in Australia, and made for the Australian market, because of its risqu\u00e9 subject matter and storylines, highly controversial for its time, it did not sell in many overseas markets including the United Kingdom and even in the United States.\nThe series based at the time during mass-emigration to Australia, featured a multicultural cast primarily of British extraction, as well as many well known veteran actors in Australia, mainly from the early days of radio and stage. Indeed, as theatre had been the preferred form of entertainment, many stars like &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Blacklock\"&gt;Wendy Blacklock&lt;/a&gt;, were reluctant to go into a TV serial.\nThe series, although originally based on elements of \"Coronation Street\", was later more likened to US serial \"&lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Place%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Peyton Place&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBroadcasting and production.\nIn 1972 Australian television featured many imported shows. Previous Australian soaps \"&lt;a href=\"Autumn%20Affair\"&gt;Autumn Affair&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20Of%20Peter%20Grey\"&gt;The Story Of Peter Grey&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Motel%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Motel&lt;/a&gt;\" were only mildly successful. Long running ABC soap \"Bellbird\" was moderately popular in the city, but more popular in rural areas. The popular &lt;a href=\"Crawford%20Productions\"&gt;Crawford Productions&lt;/a&gt; shows \"&lt;a href=\"Homicide%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Homicide&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Division%204\"&gt;Division 4&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Matlock%20Police\"&gt;Matlock Police&lt;/a&gt;\" were &lt;a href=\"police%20procedural\"&gt;police procedural&lt;/a&gt;s, rather than conventional soap operas. \nBill Harmon and Don Cash had previously worked in New York at &lt;a href=\"National%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, and became a partnership after arriving in Australia and producing adventure series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rovers%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Rovers&lt;/a&gt;\" and a couple of unsuccessful films.\nProduction of \"Number 96\" started in October 1971. It was produced in monochrome for the first three years and switched to colour production in late 1974.\nThe premise, original story outlines and original characters were devised by series creator &lt;a href=\"David%20Sale\"&gt;David Sale&lt;/a&gt;, who had also written for comedy series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mavis%20Bramston%20Show\"&gt;The Mavis Bramston Show&lt;/a&gt;\". Sale also wrote the scripts for the first episodes of \"Number 96\" and continued as a script writer and storyliner for much of the show's run.\nA building at 83 Moncur Street, &lt;a href=\"Woollahra\"&gt;Woollahra&lt;/a&gt; was used for exterior establishing shots of the block of flats. The majority of taping was done on sets at Channel Ten's studio based then in &lt;a href=\"Lane%20Cove\"&gt;Lane Cove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.\nDirectors included Peter Benardos and Brian Phillis. Regular writers included David Sale, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Whyte\"&gt;Johnny Whyte&lt;/a&gt; who was the series final script editor, Lynn Foster, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Shadie\"&gt;Ken Shadie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Witcombe\"&gt;Eleanor Witcombe&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorylines and characters.\n\"Number 96\" was known for its groundbreaking adult storylines and nude glimpses, its comedy characters, and controversial storylines including teenage drug addiction and a black mass conducted by devil worshipers. Whodunits included a panty snatcher dubbed the knicker snipper, the pantyhose murderer, and the bomb in the building.\nA story where Rose Godulfus (&lt;a href=\"Vivienne%20Garrett\"&gt;Vivienne Garrett&lt;/a&gt;) took marijuana was the first time the Australian Broadcasting Control Board exercised the 101 censorship code.\nEarly shock moments involved the travails of the pregnant Helen Eastwood (&lt;a href=\"Briony%20Behets\"&gt;Briony Behets&lt;/a&gt;) whose husband Mark (&lt;a href=\"Martin%20Harris%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Martin Harris&lt;/a&gt;) had an affair with Rose Godolfus. Doctor Gordon Vansard (&lt;a href=\"Joe%20James%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Joe James&lt;/a&gt;) was struck off for providing drugs for an illegal abortion. His wife Sonia (&lt;a href=\"Lynn%20Rainbow\"&gt;Lynn Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;) suffered from mental delusions. Sonia returned for the film version of \"Number 96\". \nThe series launched the career of &lt;a href=\"Abigail%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Abigail&lt;/a&gt;, who was promoted as a sex symbol. It was the first soap globally to feature an ongoing gay character, Don Finlayson (&lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hasham\"&gt;Joe Hasham&lt;/a&gt;). Don was a dependable lawyer who was joined by his more flamboyant partner Dudley Butterfield, played by &lt;a href=\"Chard%20Hayward\"&gt;Chard Hayward&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe series featured a transgender character portrayed by Sydney cabaret performer &lt;a href=\"Carlotta%20%28performer%29\"&gt;Carlotta&lt;/a&gt;, (credited as Carole Lee) in a short storyline in 1973. There was an interracial romance featuring character Chad Farrell, played by dancer &lt;a href=\"Ronne%20Arnold\"&gt;Ronne Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in 18 episodes, and an ongoing role in 20 episodes for indigenous actress &lt;a href=\"Justine%20Saunders\"&gt;Justine Saunders&lt;/a&gt;, who as Rhonda Jackson campaigns for Aboriginal rights.\nMain cast.\nKey cast members, appearing in 75 or more episodes:\nCelebrity cameos.\nTV host &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Walsh%20%28TV%20host%29\"&gt;Mike Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, made a &lt;a href=\"cameo%20appearance\"&gt;cameo appearance&lt;/a&gt; as himself.\nCameos included &lt;a href=\"Lorrae%20Desmond\"&gt;Lorrae Desmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Lamond\"&gt;Toni Lamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazel%20Phillips\"&gt;Hazel Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, (who had auditioned for the role of Vera Collins), &lt;a href=\"Carlotta%20%28performer%29\"&gt;Carlotta&lt;/a&gt; and dancer &lt;a href=\"Ronne%20Arnold\"&gt;Ronne Arnold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe series featured over 100 performers, as well as crew members, including screenwriters and technicians and upcoming performers who were given the opportunity to develop their craft, as well as featuring alumni of the acting world that came into the series in guest roles including: \n&lt;a href=\"Judi%20Farr\"&gt;Judi Farr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paula%20Duncan\"&gt;Paula Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, Sheila Helpmann (sister of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Helpmann\"&gt;Robert Helpmann&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Enid%20Lorimer\"&gt;Enid Lorimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noeline%20Brown\"&gt;Noeline Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Szeps\"&gt;Henri Szeps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Meagher\"&gt;Ray Meagher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rowena%20Wallace\"&gt;Rowena Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20English\"&gt;Jon English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Charleston\"&gt;Anne Charleston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Bishop\"&gt;Pat Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Moll\"&gt;Brian Moll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Penne%20Hackforth-Jones\"&gt;Penne Hackforth-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Hughes\"&gt;Wendy Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Haywood\"&gt;Chris Haywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20Rogers\"&gt;Tristan Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Gorman\"&gt;Reg Gorman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Penny%20Ramsey\"&gt;Penny Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Porteous\"&gt;Shane Porteous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joyce%20Jacobs\"&gt;Joyce Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Wenzel\"&gt;Brian Wenzel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moya%20O%27Sullivan\"&gt;Moya O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumerous stars wanted to appear in guest roles, even racing identity &lt;a href=\"Gai%20Waterhouse\"&gt;Gai Waterhouse&lt;/a&gt;, who had completed a drama course in England, also suggested was a young &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Brown\"&gt;Bryan Brown&lt;/a&gt; (although having been in England he had acquired a British accent, and was not suited at the time by producer Bill Harmon, even though he hails from Parramatta).\nControversies.\nThe show attracted many complaints. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Broadcasting%20Control%20Board\"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Control Board&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly sanctioned the network. To keep the series on air, each episode was previewed to ensure it complied with Control Board guidelines. Sometimes offending scenes would be cut from the episode after its Sydney airing and were not seen when episode screened elsewhere. Consequently, the first episodes feature cuts and screen blackouts. Paperwork of the removed material survives with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20and%20Sound%20Archive\"&gt;National Film and Sound Archive&lt;/a&gt; but the actual reel of footage has not been found. Eventually due to the show's popularity the Broadcasting Control Board relaxed its restrictions and stopped previewing episodes.\nInternational screenings.\nCast members were amazed to learn the show was screening in some overseas countries. Cast member &lt;a href=\"Bettina%20Welch\"&gt;Bettina Welch&lt;/a&gt; reported seeing it dubbed in Italy. But despite a short late-night run in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, Canada on &lt;a href=\"Citytv\"&gt;Citytv&lt;/a&gt;, the content was far too explicit for US and UK television. An attempt to sell the show at &lt;a href=\"Cannes\"&gt;Cannes&lt;/a&gt; TV Festival in 1975 with a topless model backfired when British newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mirror\"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that \"it got a swift 'No Entry' sign\" from there broadcasters the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Television\"&gt;ATV&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFilm adaptation.\n\"Number 96\" was adapted as a feature film in 1974 and titled \"&lt;a href=\"Number%2096%20%28film%29\"&gt;Number 96&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the major drawcards being it was a full colour production, unlike the series which was still broadcasting in monochrome. It had the same creative team and mostly the same cast as the series. Although it received mostly negative reviews, audiences lined up all down &lt;a href=\"George%20Street%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;George Street&lt;/a&gt; to gain a cinema seat. It earned nearly A$2.5 million on a A$100,000 budget, and was to that time one of the most profitable Australian movies ever made. Characters in the film received applause when they made their entrances.\nSeries evolution.\n\"Number 96\" was Australia's highest-rated program for 1973 and 1974. The series was shot on &lt;a href=\"videotape\"&gt;videotape&lt;/a&gt; initially in &lt;a href=\"black-and-white\"&gt;black-and-white&lt;/a&gt; but switching to colour in late 1974. Many black and white episodes are &lt;a href=\"Lost%20television%20broadcast\"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt;, the videotapes being wiped for re-use, which was the official policy at Channel Ten at the time.\nDuring 1974, the series shifted its emphasis from sexual situations and drama to focus more on comedy. By mid-1975 ratings had gone into decline so a bold new storyline was devised to revitalise the series. The Mad Bomber storyline, in August\u2013September 1975, came in the wake of news from periodical \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Week\"&gt;TV Week&lt;/a&gt;\" that the ratings for \"Number 96\" had dropped to half what they had been at the beginning of 1974. In an unprecedented move, 40 complete scripts were discarded and rewritten, while the \"Number 96\" set was sealed off to non-essential personnel. The new storyline involved a mysterious figure planting a time bomb in Number 96, following a series of warnings and false alarms. The dramatic storyline was intended to draw back viewers and to provide a mechanism to quickly write out several existing characters in a bid to freshen up the cast of characters and revamp the storylines.\nOn 5 September 1975, a bomb exploded in the delicatessen, destroying it and the adjacent wine bar, which was crowded with customers. The makers of the show made a bold move, killing several long-running cast favourites, including Les, Aldo and Roma Godolfus (&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Lockwood\"&gt;Johnny Lockwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philippa%20Baker%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Philippa Baker&lt;/a&gt;), and then revealing schemer Maggie Cameron as the bomber and sending her off to prison. (She never planned for the bomb to kill anyone and merely wanted to scare residents into moving to facilitate a sale of the building.) Despite the publicity and major changes it brought, the bomb-blast storyline resulted in only a temporary boost to the program's ratings.\nBy October central figures Lucy and Alf Sutcliffe (played by original cast members &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20Kirkby\"&gt;Elisabeth Kirkby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Elliott%20%28actor%29\"&gt;James Elliott&lt;/a&gt;) were also written out of the series. New, younger characters were added to the show, most of whom didn't last out the series. Two that did were orphaned teenage sisters Debbie and Jane Chester &lt;a href=\"Dina%20Mann\"&gt;Dina Mann&lt;/a&gt; and Suzanne Church. Other enduring characters among the high cast turnover of the later period were the new blond sex-symbol Jaja Gibson (&lt;a href=\"Anya%20Saleky\"&gt;Anya Saleky&lt;/a&gt;), and Giovanni Lenzi (&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Michaels\"&gt;Harry Michaels&lt;/a&gt;), an exuberant Italian who worked in the deli.\nA later whodunit storyline was the Hooded Rapist in May 1976. Episodes around the time of episode 1000 in June 1976 saw an increase in location shooting, including Moncur Street, &lt;a href=\"Woollahra\"&gt;Woollahra&lt;/a&gt; (outside the building used in the credits), local parks, &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Park%20Sydney\"&gt;Luna Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final year of \"Number 96\" featured an continued emphasis on younger characters and the reintroduction of sexual situations and nudity. Don and Dudley had split; Don's new boyfriend was Rob Forsyth (&lt;a href=\"John%20McTernan%20%28actor%29\"&gt;John McTernan&lt;/a&gt;). The show's final months in 1977 included a range of shock storylines including a Nazi biker gang and a psychopathic blackmailer.\nAnother bold move in the show's final months saw \"Number 96\" feature what was publicised as Australian television's first full frontal nude scene when new character Miss Hemingway (&lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Gray\"&gt;Deborah Gray&lt;/a&gt;) made the first of several unveilings in April 1977. \"Number 96\" had in November 1976 shown a brief full frontal nude flash when bit-part nurse fled Dudley's bedroom that caught on fire, but this was the first time full nudity was shown front and centre in protracted scenes. In one striking moment, Miss Hemingway wore a bra but no panties. Despite screening at 8.30 pm there were few complaints. Other bedroom farce comedy sequences of the period featured increasing levels of male and female semi-nudity, and other instances of full frontal female nudity. A scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new Number 96 resident Toby Buxton (&lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Thompson\"&gt;Malcolm Thompson&lt;/a&gt;), featured a brief glimpse of full frontal male nudity.\nThese changes to the series were made to combat falling viewing figures. However, they were not a success, and in July 1977 the series was cancelled due to declining ratings. Dorrie (&lt;a href=\"Pat%20McDonald%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Pat McDonald&lt;/a&gt;) and Herb Evans (&lt;a href=\"Ron%20Shand\"&gt;Ron Shand&lt;/a&gt;) and Don Finlayson (&lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hasham\"&gt;Joe Hasham&lt;/a&gt;) where the only original cast members to remain to the final episode (Shand had not been in the unaired pilot).\nSeries format.\nThe first episode began with an exterior shot of the building with moving vans being unloaded while Herb and Dorrie are heard having an argument. Each subsequent episode began with an exterior shot of the building while audio from the previous episode's final scene could be heard. The shot would zoom in on the apartment in which that scene occurred, or remain unchanged, as the show's title was displayed. The vision would then switch to the scene in question as a recap of the previous episode's cliffhanger.\nThe feature film has a pre-credits sequence involving Vera being raped, followed by the film's opening titles. After this, the opening shot is a zoom-in on the exterior of flat 3 and the action starts with the interior activities of flat 3.\nThe series was broadcast as five half-hour episodes each week for its first four years. From the beginning of 1976 episodes were broadcast as two one-hour episodes each week in most areas. However, from an internal perspective episodes continued to be written and compiled in half-hour instalments.\nCrew.\nThe production supervisor on the series was Kevin Powell, son of British film director &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Powell\"&gt;Michael Powell&lt;/a&gt;. The show's studio directors were Peter Benardos and Brian Phillis. Audio directors included Terry Green, Ross Boyer, Larry Price, Robert Judson, John Keane and Steve Wakely. Director's Assistants included Gillian B. Brown and Maggie Powell. Executive Producer of the series was Bob Huber. Series producers included David Hannay and Ted Jobbins. Network producers were &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Sales%20Cash\"&gt;Nancy Sales Cash&lt;/a&gt; of Cash Harmon Television. Lighting directors included George Poole, Adrian O'Bearn, Phil Cullen, Paul Gilfeather, Richard Curtis and Peter Richardson. Floor managers included Keith Walker and Murray Graham. Credits director and opener and closer director was Monica Pendegast. Audio boom operators included Laurie Hutchins, Vladimir Lozinski, John Dodds, Paul McCloskey, Jack O'Brien, Steve Wakely (later a series audio director).\nCameramen who worked on the show over the years included Max Cleary, Allan Catt, Bob Henderson, Keith Watson, Dennis Livingston, Ian O'Brien, Chris Fraser, John Bott, Roy Chivers, Murray Kelso, Phil Lomas.\nAwards.\nAside from the four Logies won by cast member Pat McDonald during her run with the show, \"Number 96\" won the \"Best Drama\" Logie in 1974, 1975 and 1976. Actor Bunney Brooke won the \"Best Actress\" Logie Award for her work as Flo in 1975.\nThe series cast became stars in Australia and had their own \"Number 96 Passenger train\", specially designed for cast and crew travel which for the show's first few years they would take the train from Sydney to Melbourne for the annual \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Week\"&gt;TV Week&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Logie%20Awards\"&gt;Logie Awards&lt;/a&gt; in a silver multi-carriaged train with the commissioner's carriage hooked up at the rear for VIPs. This train was specially-organised by publicity director Tom Greer. The 16-hour overnight journey left from the centre of Sydney at 4.30pm with a farewell party, complete with red carpet and jazz band in attendance; it would feature &lt;a href=\"Whistle-stop%20train%20tour\"&gt;whistle stops&lt;/a&gt; at country sidings and saw thousands of people turn out to see their favourite stars, before it arrived at &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Cross%20railway%20station\"&gt;Spencer Street station&lt;/a&gt;. These whistle stops were all beamed back by television stations and went live to air. The rail service of the time was keen to promote its overnight tourism package's, and for the journey the train was christened as the \"Spirit of 96\".\nA humorous story, as told by Greer, was the engagement of a piano player (the outrageous John McDonald) to entertain the cast on the train on the way to Melbourne. John could only play upright pianos. The railways rang and said they could not get the upright around the passageway corners of the train so it would be impossible to get it on board. Greer demanded it be put on the train somehow even if it meant dismantling the piano and putting it back together \u2013 \"key by key\". In desperation, engineers arrived and took off the side of the carriage, loaded the piano on with a forklift, before replacing the carriage wall. The train used green steam locomotive number &lt;a href=\"3801\"&gt;3801&lt;/a&gt;, which frequently operated the \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Progress\"&gt;Spirit of Progress&lt;/a&gt;\" train service between Sydney and Melbourne.\nMerchandise.\nIn 1975 the \"Number 96 Cookbook\" was released in Australian by the publisher &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Magazines\"&gt;Family Circle&lt;/a&gt;; it featured recipes from eight members of the cast.\nThe series celebrated 1000 episodes in 1976 with a compilation special, \"Number 96: And They Said It Wouldn't Last\", which reviewed the show's most famous story lines and recounted the exploits of its departed main characters. \"And They Said It Wouldn't Last\" was repeated at the start of 1977 with a new ending presented by &lt;a href=\"Dina%20Mann\"&gt;Dina Mann&lt;/a&gt;. It is featured on the DVD release.\nFinal night.\nThe final episode ended with a reunion &lt;a href=\"curtain%20call\"&gt;curtain call&lt;/a&gt; of popular cast members past and present. A week after the airing of the final episode in Sydney a televised public auction of props and costumes from the series was held in the grounds of Channel 10.\nAmerican version.\nIn 1980 a short-lived US remake of the same name on &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; retained the comedy, but toned down the sexual elements of the series. The series was launched over three consecutive nights, from 10 to 12 December. US television and \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" promotions for the series utilised advertising &lt;a href=\"hyperbole\"&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the series had been \"banned in Australia.\" The nudity and racy content of the original series was not present in the remake; it would probably not have been allowed in the US due to censorship standards there, so the US version only hinted at the sexual content that had been on display in the original. The US version of \"Number 96\" was quickly cancelled due to low ratings. The US show was finally aired in parts of Australia in 1986.\nReruns.\nChannel 10 Sydney started a repeat run of the series on 4 February 1980, starting from the first episode fully produced in colour, episode number 585. Episodes were screened Monday through to Thursday, at midnight.\nThe 1976 special, \"And They Said It Wouldn't Last\", was repeated by Ten in a prime time slot in 1994. This edition of the special dropped the \"And\" from the original title and included a new introduction by &lt;a href=\"Abigail%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Abigail&lt;/a&gt;. It concluded with a replay of the final episode's curtain call of actors.\nCultural impact.\n\"Number 96\" was rated number 9 in the 2005 television special \"&lt;a href=\"50%20Years%2050%20Shows\"&gt;50 Years 50 Shows&lt;/a&gt;\" which counted-down Australia's greatest television programs.\n&lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Wark\"&gt;McKenzie Wark&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in \"Celebrities, Culture and Cyberspace\" (published by Pluto Press, 1999): \"Once, when I was a kid, I was walking down a suburban street at night, when i noticed a rhythmic flickering of light from inside the houses, Though screened from view by the drawn curtains, the lights from a row of separate houses were all pulsing in time, And then I heard the music and I knew everyone was watching the same show ... Number 96.\"\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Singleton\"&gt;John Singleton&lt;/a&gt; wrote: \"When &lt;a href=\"Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; was writing his plays, people queued up for Shakespeare. Today they're queuing up for Number 96, so in my opinion Number 96 is today's Shakespeare.\"\nPhillip Adams, from newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age\"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;\", wrote: \"I believe that television serials provide a surrogate sense of community and that many viewers are more involved in Number 96, than they are in their own community.\"\nDocumentary.\nThe series was featured in cinema documentary \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20Quite%20Hollywood\"&gt;Not Quite Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008).

When Australian television was switched to colour in 1975 Channel 10 didn't think people would want to watch black and white again, so the master tapes were wiped or made into a \"foyer display\".
