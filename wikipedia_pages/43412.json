The city lies at the heart of the wider &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;City of Winchester&lt;/a&gt;, a local government &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20England\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt;, at the western end of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Downs\"&gt;South Downs&lt;/a&gt; National Park, on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Itchen%2C%20Hampshire\"&gt;River Itchen&lt;/a&gt;. It is south-west of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, the closest other city. At the 2011 census, Winchester had a population of 45,184. The wider City of Winchester district, which includes towns such as &lt;a href=\"New%20Alresford\"&gt;Alresford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bishop%27s%20Waltham\"&gt;Bishop's Waltham&lt;/a&gt;, has a population of 116,595. Winchester is the &lt;a href=\"county%20town\"&gt;county town&lt;/a&gt; of Hampshire and contains the head offices of &lt;a href=\"Hampshire%20County%20Council\"&gt;Hampshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinchester was the first and former capital city of England. It developed from the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Venta%20Belgarum\"&gt;Venta Belgarum&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn developed from an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;oppidum&lt;/a&gt;. Winchester remained the most important city in England until the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman conquest&lt;/a&gt; in the eleventh century. The city has since become one of the most expensive and &lt;a href=\"affluent\"&gt;affluent&lt;/a&gt; areas in the United Kingdom.\nThe city's major landmark is &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20Cathedral\"&gt;Winchester Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. The city is also home to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;University of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20College\"&gt;Winchester College&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest public school in the United Kingdom still using its original buildings.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe area around Winchester has been inhabited since &lt;a href=\"Prehistoric%20Britain\"&gt;prehistoric times&lt;/a&gt;, with three &lt;a href=\"British%20Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"British%20hillforts\"&gt;hillforts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oram%27s%20Arbour\"&gt;Oram's Arbour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Catherine%27s%20Hill%2C%20Hampshire\"&gt;St. Catherine's Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and Worthy Down all nearby. In the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Iron%20Age\"&gt;Late Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;, a more urban settlement type developed, known as an \"&lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;oppidum&lt;/a&gt;\", although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure.\nThe settlement became an important centre for the &lt;a href=\"Belgae%23Britain\"&gt;British Belgae&lt;/a&gt; tribe; however, it remains unclear how the Belgae came to control the initial settlement. Caesar recorded the tribe had crossed the channel as raiders (probably in the 1st century BCE), only to later establish themselves. The Roman account of continental invaders has been challenged in recent years with scientific studies favouring a gradual change through increased trade links rather than migration.\nTo the Celtic Britons, the settlement was likely known as Went\u0101 or Venta (from a common &lt;a href=\"Common%20Brittonic\"&gt;Celtic word&lt;/a&gt; meaning \"tribal town\" or \"meeting place\"). Although an etymology connected with the Celtic word for \"white\" (&lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Modern Welsh&lt;/a&gt; \"gwyn\") has been suggested, due to Winchester's situation upon chalk. It was the Latinised versions of this name, together with that of the tribe that gave the town its Roman name of Venta Belgarum.\nRoman period.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Roman conquest of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the settlement served as the capital () of the Belgae and was distinguished as Venta Belgarum, \"Venta of the Belgae\". Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to &lt;a href=\"Silchester%20Roman%20Town\"&gt;Silchester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noviomagus%20Reginorum\"&gt;Chichester&lt;/a&gt;, Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century. At the beginning of the third century, Winchester was given protective &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20city%20walls\"&gt;stone walls&lt;/a&gt;. At around this time the city covered an area of , making it among the largest towns in Roman Britain by surface area. There was a limited suburban area outside the walls. Like many other Roman towns however, Winchester began to decline in the later fourth century.\nMedieval period.\nPost-Roman Winchester.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20withdrawal%20from%20Britain\"&gt;Roman withdrawal from Britain&lt;/a&gt; urban life continued much as it had done into the mid fifth century. The settlement reduced in size, but work was carried out to improve the city's defences. The city may have functioned as a centre for a religious community or a royal palace, as they continued to use the Christian cemeteries established in the Roman period.\nWinchester appears in early &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20literature\"&gt;Welsh literature&lt;/a&gt; and is commonly identified as the city of listed among the &lt;a href=\"Caer%23Britain\"&gt;28 cities of Britain&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Brittonum\"&gt;History of the Britons&lt;/a&gt;\" (commonly attributed to &lt;a href=\"Nennius\"&gt;Nennius&lt;/a&gt;). The city is known as Caerwynt in &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Welsh\"&gt;Modern Welsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nKingdom of Wessex.\nThe city became known as Wintanceaster (\"Fort Venta\") in &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt;. In 648, &lt;a href=\"King%20Cenwalh%20of%20Wessex\"&gt;King Cenwalh of Wessex&lt;/a&gt; erected the Church of St Peter and St Paul, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;Old Minster&lt;/a&gt;. This became a cathedral in the 660s when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from &lt;a href=\"Dorchester-on-Thames\"&gt;Dorchester-on-Thames&lt;/a&gt;. The present form of the city dates from reconstruction in the late 9th century, when &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20the%20Great\"&gt;King Alfred the Great&lt;/a&gt; obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defence against the &lt;a href=\"Viking%20invasions%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt;. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.\nIn the early 10th century there were two new ecclesiastical establishments: the convent of &lt;a href=\"Nunnaminster\"&gt;Nunnaminster&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Alfred's widow &lt;a href=\"Ealhswith\"&gt;Ealhswith&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Minster%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;New Minster&lt;/a&gt;. Bishop &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;\u00c6thelwold of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; was a leading figure in the monastic reform movement of the later 10th century. He expelled the secular canons of both minsters and replaced them with monks. He created the drainage system, the \"Lockburn\", which served as the town drain until 1875, and still survives. Also in the late 10th century, the Old Minster was enlarged as a centre of the cult of the 9th century &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Bishop of Winchester&lt;/a&gt;, Saint &lt;a href=\"Swithun\"&gt;Swithun&lt;/a&gt;. The three minsters were the home of what architectural historian John Crook describes as \"the supreme artistic achievements\" of the \"Winchester School\".\nThe consensus among historians of Anglo-Saxon England is that the court was mobile in this period and there was no fixed capital. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Biddle\"&gt;Martin Biddle&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that Winchester was a centre for royal administration in the 7th and 8th centuries, but this is questioned by &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Yorke\"&gt;Barbara Yorke&lt;/a&gt;, who sees it as significant that the shire was named after Hamtun, the forerunner of &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;. However, Winchester is described by the historian Catherine Cubitt as \"the premier city of the West Saxon kingdom\" and &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Nelson\"&gt;Janet Nelson&lt;/a&gt; describes London and Winchester as Alfred the Great's \"proto-capitals\".\nThere was a fire in the city in 1141 during the &lt;a href=\"Rout%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Rout of Winchester&lt;/a&gt;. In the 14th century, &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Wykeham\"&gt;William of Wykeham&lt;/a&gt; played a role in the city's restoration. As &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Bishop of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; he was responsible for much of the current structure of the cathedral, and he founded the still extant public school &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20College\"&gt;Winchester College&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the city was an important centre of the wool trade, before going into a slow decline. The &lt;a href=\"curfew%20bell\"&gt;curfew bell&lt;/a&gt; in the bell tower (near the clock in the picture), still sounds at 8:00 pm each evening.\nJews in Winchester.\nJews lived in Winchester from at least 1148, and in the 13th century the Jewish community in the city was one of the most important in England. There was an &lt;a href=\"Archa%20%28document%20store%29\"&gt;archa&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20quarter%20%28diaspora%29\"&gt;Jewish quarter&lt;/a&gt; was located in the city's heart (present day Jewry street). There were a series of &lt;a href=\"blood%20libel\"&gt;blood libel&lt;/a&gt; claims against the Jewish community in the 1220s and 1230s, which likely was the cause of the hanging of the community's leader, Abraham Pinch, in front of the synagogue of which he was the head. &lt;a href=\"Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester\"&gt;Simon de Montfort&lt;/a&gt; ransacked the Jewish quarter in 1264, and in 1290 all Jews were &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20Expulsion\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; from England.\nModern period.\nThe City Cross (also known as the &lt;a href=\"Buttercross\"&gt;Buttercross&lt;/a&gt;) has been dated to the 15th century, and features 12 statues of the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, other saints and various historical figures. Several statues appear to have been added throughout the structure's history. In 1770, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Dummer\"&gt;Thomas Dummer&lt;/a&gt; purchased the Buttercross from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at &lt;a href=\"Cranbury%20Park\"&gt;Cranbury Park&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Otterbourne\"&gt;Otterbourne&lt;/a&gt;. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who \"organised a small riot\", and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a &lt;a href=\"lath%20and%20plaster\"&gt;lath and plaster&lt;/a&gt; facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather. The Buttercross itself was restored by &lt;a href=\"George%20Gilbert%20Scott\"&gt;George Gilbert Scott&lt;/a&gt; in 1865, and still stands in the High Street. It is now a &lt;a href=\"Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument\"&gt;Scheduled Ancient Monument&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20city%20walls\"&gt;city walls&lt;/a&gt; were originally built in the Roman period covering an area of around , and were rebuilt and expanded in sections over time. A large portion of the city walls, built on Roman foundations, were demolished in the 18th and 19th centuries as they fell into ruin and the gates became a barrier to traffic and a danger to pedestrians, with only a small portion of the original Roman wall itself surviving. Of the six gates (North, South, East, West, Durn, and King's Gates), only the &lt;a href=\"Kingsgate%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;Kingsgate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westgate%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;Westgate&lt;/a&gt; survive, with sections of the walls remaining around the two gates and near the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Wolvesey%20Castle\"&gt;Wolvesey Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree notable bronze sculptures can be seen in or from the High Street by major sculptors of the 19th and 20th centuries, the earliest a monumental statue of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, now in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hall\"&gt;Great Hall&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alfred%20Gilbert\"&gt;Sir Alfred Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the sculptor of '&lt;a href=\"Eros\"&gt;Eros&lt;/a&gt;' in London's Piccadilly Circus), &lt;a href=\"King%20Alfred\"&gt;King Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, facing the city with raised sword from the centre of The Broadway, by &lt;a href=\"Hamo%20Thornycroft\"&gt;Hamo Thornycroft&lt;/a&gt; and the modern striking \"&lt;a href=\"Horse%20and%20Rider%20%28Frink%29\"&gt;Horse and Rider&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Elizabeth%20Frink\"&gt;Dame Elizabeth Frink&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to the Law Courts.\nThe novelist &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Austen\"&gt;Jane Austen&lt;/a&gt; died in Winchester on 18 July 1817 and is buried in the cathedral. While staying in Winchester from mid-August to October 1819, the Romantic poet &lt;a href=\"John%20Keats\"&gt;John Keats&lt;/a&gt; wrote \"Isabella\", \"St. Agnes' Eve\", \"&lt;a href=\"To%20Autumn\"&gt;To Autumn&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Lamia\" and parts of \"&lt;a href=\"Hyperion%20%28poem%29\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt;\" and the five-act poetic tragedy \"Otho The Great\".\nIn 2013, businesses involved in the housing market were reported by a local newspaper as saying that the city's architectural and historical interest, and its fast links to other towns and cities, had led Winchester to become one of the most expensive and desirable areas of the country and ranked Winchester as one of the least deprived areas in England and Wales.\nGeography.\nWinchester is situated on a bed of &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; lower chalk with small areas of clay and loam soil, inset with combined clay and rich sources of &lt;a href=\"fuller%27s%20earth\"&gt;fuller's earth&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nAs with the rest of the UK, Winchester experiences an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfb\"). The nearest Met Office station is in &lt;a href=\"Martyr%20Worthy\"&gt;Martyr Worthy&lt;/a&gt;, just outside the city.\nSuburbs.\nAside from the city centre, there are several suburbs and neighbourhoods within the city, including:\nGovernance.\nFrom 1835 to 1974, Winchester was governed as a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20borough\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt; of Hampshire. Until 1902 the city's affairs were also administered partly by its parishes: St Lawrence, St Mary Kalendar, St Maurice, St Michael, St Peter Colebrook, St Swithin, St Thomas, St John, St Bartholomew Hyde, Milland, St Faith, and St Peter Cheesehill, and its extra-parochial areas: Cathedral Precincts, St Mary's College Precincts, St Cross Hospital Precinct, and Wolvesey. Historically, the south of the city had come under the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20%28division%29\"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Soke%20%28legal%29\"&gt;Soke&lt;/a&gt;\", and was thereby self-governing to a large extent. Since 1974 the city has been governed as part of the wider &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;City of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;. The district has 16 electoral wards, Five of these cover the area of the city itself: St Barnabas, St Paul, St Luke, St Bartholomew, and St Michael; they have three councillors each apart from St Luke, which is a two-member ward. For &lt;a href=\"Hampshire%20County%20Council\"&gt;Hampshire County Council&lt;/a&gt; elections, the City of Winchester district is made up of 7 wards, with Winchester Westgate and Winchester Eastgate covering the city itself.\nThe current ward boundaries were adopted in &lt;a href=\"2016%20Winchester%20City%20Council%20election\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, when all seats were up for election. Since then, &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20City%20Council%20elections\"&gt;Winchester City Council elections&lt;/a&gt; take place in three out of every four years, with one third of the councillors elected in each election. From the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Winchester%20Council%20election\"&gt;2006 election&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Winchester%20City%20Council%20election\"&gt;2010 election&lt;/a&gt; the council was led by &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010 it was briefly controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, before being controlled by the Conservatives again from 2011 until &lt;a href=\"2019%20Winchester%20City%20Council%20election\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, when the Liberal Democrats took control.\n&lt;a href=\"Winchester%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Winchester&lt;/a&gt; is currently represented in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Brine\"&gt;Steve Brine&lt;/a&gt;, of the Conservatives, who in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2010 General Election&lt;/a&gt; beat Martin Tod, the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; candidate, by 3048 votes (a margin of 5.4%). &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Oaten\"&gt;Mark Oaten&lt;/a&gt; had previously won the seat for the Liberal Democrats during the 1997 general election in which he defeated &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20Malone\"&gt;Gerry Malone&lt;/a&gt;, a Health Minister in &lt;a href=\"John%20Major\"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; Government who had held the seat since 1992. Brine was re-elected in 2015 and in 2017. In 2019 he briefly sat as an Independent before being re-elected as a Conservative in the 2019 election.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Mayor of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; currently exists as a ceremonial role, but dates back at least as far as the late 12th century. The mayoral term length is currently one year.\nLandmarks.\nCathedral.\n&lt;a href=\"Winchester%20Cathedral\"&gt;Winchester Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; was originally built in 1079 and remains the longest Gothic cathedral in Europe. It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Bishops of Winchester&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Wykeham\"&gt;William of Wykeham&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; monarchs (such as &lt;a href=\"Egbert%20of%20Wessex\"&gt;Egbert of Wessex&lt;/a&gt;) and later monarchs such as King &lt;a href=\"Canute%20the%20Great\"&gt;Canute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;William Rufus&lt;/a&gt;. It was once an important &lt;a href=\"pilgrim\"&gt;pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;age centre and housed the &lt;a href=\"shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Swithun\"&gt;Saint Swithun&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%27%20Way\"&gt;Pilgrims' Way&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Canterbury\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier &lt;a href=\"Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;Old Minster&lt;/a&gt; is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The &lt;a href=\"New%20Minster%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;New Minster&lt;/a&gt; (the original burial place of &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alfred the Great&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Edward the Elder&lt;/a&gt;) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a &lt;a href=\"priory\"&gt;priory&lt;/a&gt;. Of particular note is the \"&lt;a href=\"Deanery\"&gt;Deanery&lt;/a&gt;\", which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Arthur%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Arthur, Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; in 1486. Not far away is \"Cheyney Court\", a mid 15th-century &lt;a href=\"timber%20framing\"&gt;timber-framed&lt;/a&gt; house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\nThe earliest &lt;a href=\"hammer-beam\"&gt;hammer-beam&lt;/a&gt;ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the \"Pilgrims' Hall\", as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrims%27%20School\"&gt;The Pilgrims' School&lt;/a&gt;, the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.\nEntrance for pedestrians to the North &lt;a href=\"garth%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;garth&lt;/a&gt; of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.\nWolvesey Castle and Palace.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolvesey%20Castle\"&gt;Wolvesey Castle&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Normans\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20de%20Blois\"&gt;Henry de Blois&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"the%20Anarchy\"&gt;the Anarchy&lt;/a&gt; of his brother King &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20of%20England\"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt;'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary Tudor&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip II of Spain&lt;/a&gt; were guests just before their wedding in the cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt;), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\nCastle.\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20Castle\"&gt;its castle&lt;/a&gt;, which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur\"&gt;King Arthur&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Round%20Table\"&gt;Round Table&lt;/a&gt;\", which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;King Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; in 1522. The names of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Round%20Table\"&gt;Knights of the Round Table&lt;/a&gt; are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Charles\"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20House%2C%20Winchester\"&gt;King's House&lt;/a&gt;, now incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Peninsula%20Barracks\"&gt;Peninsula Barracks&lt;/a&gt; where there are five military museums.
