    "text": "Ross Tokely (born 8 March 1979) is a Scottish professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach who plays for &lt;a href=\"St%20Duthus%20F.C.\"&gt;St. Duthus FC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Caledonian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;North Caledonian League&lt;/a&gt;. Tokely previously played for &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brora%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Brora Rangers&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;right-back.&lt;/a&gt;\nTokely joined Inverness from &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Highland League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Huntly%20F.C.\"&gt;Huntly&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and remained at the club until June 2012, for a total of 16 seasons at the &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; club. Tokely was ICT's longest serving player and currently holds their appearance record. He also holds the distinction of having played and scored in every division of &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20football%20pyramid\"&gt;Scottish league football&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;SPL&lt;/a&gt;, for Inverness.\nPlaying career.\nInverness.\nTokely was born in &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;. He was signed to &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt; by manager Steve Paterson and made his first appearance in the side that won the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; title in &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. Tokely gradually established himself in the side, usually playing at right back, although he has sometimes played in central defence or as a &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;holding midfielder&lt;/a&gt;.\nTokely retained his place in the team as Inverness progressed through the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nTokely also had more positive successes during this period, notably a fantastic goal against his boyhood heroes &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Tokely hit a 20-yard shot into the top corner at &lt;a href=\"Tynecastle%20Stadium\"&gt;Tynecastle&lt;/a&gt; as Inverness defeated another SPL club in the cup, having won 3\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Park\"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. Tokely also scored the winning &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dunfermline Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in the following &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Scottish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nTokely was part of the squad that won promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;SPL&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, by winning the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; title. As Inverness moved into the SPL, he retained his spot in the side, being awarded the number 2 jersey. After 10 years of service to the club, Tokely was awarded a &lt;a href=\"testimonial%20match\"&gt;testimonial match&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout their five-year stint in the top league, Tokely was an established player in the side. His longest spell out of the team came in 2007, when he missed a month of first team action after being sent off for an off the ball punch on &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Steven%20McGarry\"&gt;Steven McGarry&lt;/a&gt;. As the Highland club unsuccessfully battled against relegation in &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, manager &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Butcher\"&gt;Terry Butcher&lt;/a&gt; joked that he wanted his side to achieve more league points than Tokley's total of disciplinary points. Tokely racked up further disciplinary points as he was sent off for a professional foul on the final day of the season against &lt;a href=\"Falkirk%20F.C.\"&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt;. Inverness went on to lose the decisive match 1\u20130, and were consequently relegated.\nNonetheless, Tokely retained his place in the Inverness side after their drop back down to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;, helping the club gain promotion straight back to the SPL in &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Scottish%20First%20Division\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. He was made &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of the team for his 500th appearance for Inverness, a 1\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Airdrie United&lt;/a&gt;. Tokely agreed a new contract with Inverness in June 2010, despite receiving offers from overseas. In May 2012, he rejected a contract offer from Inverness and ended his 16-year career with the club.\nRoss County.\nOn 7 June 2012, Tokely signed for &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year contract.\nBrora Rangers.\nTokely joined &lt;a href=\"Brora%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Brora Rangers&lt;/a&gt; as a player/coach in January 2013. On Saturday 5 October Brora drew 1\u20131 with league rivals &lt;a href=\"Cove%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Cove Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, but went on to beat them 3\u20130 away from home in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, flying high in the Highland League, Brora were favourites to beat &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; in the 2nd round but lost 2\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Broadwood%20Stadium\"&gt;Broadwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013\u201314 Brora won the &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Highland League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in their history - by twenty-clear-points. They also won the &lt;a href=\"North%20of%20Scotland%20Cup\"&gt;North Of Scotland Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth time when they beat &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Elgin City&lt;/a&gt; in the 2014\u201315 final.\nOn 26 July 2014, Brora knocked &lt;a href=\"Stenhousemuir%20F.C.\"&gt;Stenhousemuir&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; after extra-time 3\u20131, Alex Sutherland hat-trick, to be beaten by &lt;a href=\"East%20Fife%20F.C.\"&gt;East Fife&lt;/a&gt; in the second round 3\u20131.\nSt Duthus.\nMidway through the 2018\u201319 season, Tokely made a return to senior football when he joined Tain based &lt;a href=\"North%20Caledonian%20Football%20League\"&gt;North Caledonian League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"St%20Duthus%20F.C.\"&gt;St Duthus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nTokely was appointed Brora Rangers manager in December 2016. Brora knocked SPFL clubs &lt;a href=\"Stranraer%20F.C.\"&gt;Stranraer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Fife%20F.C.\"&gt;East Fife&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2017\u201318 Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before eventually losing to Premiership club &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth round (last 16). They had poorer results in the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Highland%20Football%20League\"&gt;2017\u201318 Highland Football League&lt;/a&gt;, however, and Tokely left the club near the end of the season.\nTokely returned to Inverness to become their Youth Team coach.\nHonours.\nInverness CT\nBrora Rangers\nSt Duthus"
