    "text": "The Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind, now known as Blind Foundation, is a provider of services to &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deafblindness\"&gt;deafblind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vision%20impairment\"&gt;vision-impaired&lt;/a&gt; people in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Foundation began in 1890 as the Jubilee Institute for the Blind with a school and residence in &lt;a href=\"Parnell%2C%20Auckland\"&gt;Parnell, Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sheltered%20workshop\"&gt;Sheltered workshop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hostel\"&gt;hostel&lt;/a&gt;s were provided for many years. These were phased out at the end of the twentieth century in favour of &lt;a href=\"Mainstreaming%20%28education%29\"&gt;mainstreaming&lt;/a&gt;, members' greater integration into the community. A school run by the Foundation became part of the public school system.\nThe \"Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind Act 2002\" allows for the Foundation to become an incorporated society.\nAfter a rebranding consultation process, the name of the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind, changed to Blind Foundation in December 2013.\nServices.\nThe Foundation website lists the following services:\n&lt;a href=\"counselling\"&gt;counselling&lt;/a&gt;, equipment, financial assistance, &lt;a href=\"Volunteering\"&gt;volunteer&lt;/a&gt; assistance, mobility, &lt;a href=\"guide%20dog\"&gt;guide dog&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"employment\"&gt;employment&lt;/a&gt; assistance, &lt;a href=\"peer%20support\"&gt;peer support&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"recreation\"&gt;recreation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reading%20%28process%29\"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"writing\"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"audiobook\"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"braille\"&gt;braille&lt;/a&gt; and other formats, library, Telephone Information Service, accessible formats (braille, audio, electronic text and large print), adaptive communications and technology. The foundation also did Braille checks for the video games &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20FireRed%20and%20LeafGreen\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen&lt;/a&gt; and is mentioned in the credits.\nAll of the foundation's funding comes from public donations."
