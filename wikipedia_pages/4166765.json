    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, a split-biquaternion is a &lt;a href=\"hypercomplex%20number\"&gt;hypercomplex number&lt;/a&gt; of the form\nwhere \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" are &lt;a href=\"split-complex%20number\"&gt;split-complex number&lt;/a&gt;s and i, j, and k multiply as in the &lt;a href=\"quaternion%20group\"&gt;quaternion group&lt;/a&gt;. Since each &lt;a href=\"coefficient\"&gt;coefficient&lt;/a&gt; \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" spans two &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s, the split-biquaternion is an element of an eight-dimensional &lt;a href=\"vector%20space\"&gt;vector space&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that it carries a multiplication, this vector space is an &lt;a href=\"algebra%20over%20a%20field\"&gt;algebra&lt;/a&gt; over the real field, or an &lt;a href=\"algebra%20over%20a%20ring\"&gt;algebra over a ring&lt;/a&gt; where the split-complex numbers form the ring. This algebra was introduced by &lt;a href=\"William%20Kingdon%20Clifford\"&gt;William Kingdon Clifford&lt;/a&gt; in an 1873 article for the &lt;a href=\"London%20Mathematical%20Society\"&gt;London Mathematical Society&lt;/a&gt;. It has been repeatedly noted in mathematical literature since then, variously as a deviation in terminology, an illustration of the &lt;a href=\"tensor%20product%20of%20algebras\"&gt;tensor product of algebras&lt;/a&gt;, and as an illustration of the &lt;a href=\"direct%20sum%20of%20modules%23Direct%20sum%20of%20algebras\"&gt;direct sum of algebras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe split-biquaternions have been identified in various ways by algebraists; see below.\nModern definition.\nA split-biquaternion is &lt;a href=\"Ring%20isomorphism\"&gt;ring isomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20algebra\"&gt;Clifford algebra&lt;/a&gt; \"C\"\u21130,3(R). This is the &lt;a href=\"geometric%20algebra\"&gt;geometric algebra&lt;/a&gt; generated by three orthogonal imaginary unit basis directions, under the combination rule\ngiving an algebra spanned by the 8 basis elements with (\"e\"1\"e\"2)2 = (\"e\"2\"e\"3)2 = (\"e\"3\"e\"1)2 = \u22121 and \u03c92 = (\"e\"1\"e\"2\"e\"3)2 = +1.\nThe sub-algebra spanned by the 4 elements is the &lt;a href=\"division%20ring\"&gt;division ring&lt;/a&gt; of Hamilton's &lt;a href=\"quaternions\"&gt;quaternions&lt;/a&gt;, .\nOne can therefore see that\nwhere is the algebra spanned by the algebra of the &lt;a href=\"split-complex%20number\"&gt;split-complex number&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEquivalently,\nSplit-biquaternion group.\nThe split-biquaternions form an &lt;a href=\"associativity\"&gt;associative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ring%20theory\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; as is clear from considering multiplications in its &lt;a href=\"basis%20%28linear%20algebra%29\"&gt;basis&lt;/a&gt; {1, \u03c9, i, j, k, \u03c9i, \u03c9j, \u03c9k}. When \u03c9 is adjoined to the &lt;a href=\"quaternion%20group\"&gt;quaternion group&lt;/a&gt; one obtains a 16 element group \nDirect sum of two quaternion rings.\nThe direct sum of the division ring of quaternions with itself is denoted formula_5. The product of two elements formula_6 and formula_7 is formula_8 in this &lt;a href=\"direct%20sum%20of%20modules%23Direct%20sum%20of%20algebras\"&gt;direct sum algebra&lt;/a&gt;.\nProposition: The algebra of split-biquaternions is isomorphic to formula_9\nproof: Every split-biquaternion has an expression \"q\" = \"w\" + \"z\" \u03c9 where \"w\" and \"z\" are quaternions and \u03c92 = +1. Now if \"p\" = \"u\" + \"v\" \u03c9 is another split-biquaternion, their product is \nThe isomorphism mapping from split-biquaternions to formula_5 is given by\nIn formula_5, the product of these images, according to the algebra-product of formula_5 indicated above, is\nThis element is also the image of pq under the mapping into formula_9\nThus the products agree, the mapping is a homomorphism; and since it is &lt;a href=\"bijective\"&gt;bijective&lt;/a&gt;, it is an isomorphism.\nThough split-biquaternions form an &lt;a href=\"eight-dimensional%20space\"&gt;eight-dimensional space&lt;/a&gt; like Hamilton's biquaternions, on the basis of the Proposition it is apparent that this algebra splits into the direct sum of two copies of the real quaternions.\nHamilton biquaternion.\nThe split-biquaternions should not be confused with the (ordinary) biquaternions previously introduced by &lt;a href=\"William%20Rowan%20Hamilton\"&gt;William Rowan Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. Hamilton's &lt;a href=\"biquaternion\"&gt;biquaternion&lt;/a&gt;s are elements of the algebra\nSynonyms.\nThe following terms and compounds refer to the split-biquaternion algebra:"
