    "text": "CFRX is the international &lt;a href=\"shortwave\"&gt;shortwave&lt;/a&gt; relay of &lt;a href=\"CFRB\"&gt;CFRB&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"all-news%20radio\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"talk%20radio\"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; station in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. It transmits with a power of 1 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;kW&lt;/a&gt; on 6.07\u00a0MHz in the 49-meter shortwave band. CFRX signed on the air on February 11, 1937, 10 years after CFRB began. The shortwave signal was originally directed to the northwest in order to provide service towards northern Ontario and western Canada. When a new transmitter was installed in the 2000s, it was made non-directional with the intention of providing availability to Canadians travelling to or vacationing in the United States, particularly &lt;a href=\"Snowbird%20%28person%29\"&gt;snowbirds&lt;/a&gt;."
