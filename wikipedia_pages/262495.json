    "text": "The Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) is a college athletic conference that competes in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20III\"&gt;Division III&lt;/a&gt;. In women's &lt;a href=\"Artistic%20gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, it competes alongside &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20II\"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt; members, as the NCAA sponsors &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Women%27s%20Gymnastics%20Championships\"&gt;a single championship event&lt;/a&gt; open to members of all NCAA divisions. As the name implies, member teams are located in the state of &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, although there are three associate members from &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. All full members are part of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%20System\"&gt;University of Wisconsin System&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1913, representatives from Wisconsin's eight &lt;a href=\"normal%20school\"&gt;normal school&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014Superior Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Superior\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior&lt;/a&gt;), River Falls State Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin-River%20Falls\"&gt;University of Wisconsin-River Falls&lt;/a&gt;), Stevens Point Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Stevens%20Point\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Stevens Point&lt;/a&gt;), La Crosse State Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin-La%20Crosse\"&gt;University of Wisconsin-La Crosse&lt;/a&gt;), Oshkosh State Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Oshkosh\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh&lt;/a&gt;), Whitewater Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater&lt;/a&gt;), Milwaukee State Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Milwaukee\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;) and Platteville Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Platteville\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Platteville&lt;/a&gt;)--met in Madison to organize the Inter-Normal Athletic Conference of Wisconsin. The Stout Institute (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Stout\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Stout&lt;/a&gt;) joined in 1914, followed by Eau Claire State Normal School (now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Eau%20Claire\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire&lt;/a&gt;) in 1917.\nThe conference evolved with the growing educational mission of its member schools. It changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teachers College Conference in 1926, and the Wisconsin State College Conference in 1951. Finally, in 1964, it became the Wisconsin State University Conference.\nIn 1971, the member schools of the WSUC joined with the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Parkside\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Parkside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carthage%20College\"&gt;Carthage College&lt;/a&gt; to form the Wisconsin Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. By 1975, UW\u2013Milwaukee, &lt;a href=\"Carroll%20University\"&gt;Carroll College&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Green%20Bay\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marquette%20University\"&gt;Marquette University&lt;/a&gt; had also joined. With the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics%20for%20Women\"&gt;Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, the member schools joined their male counterparts in either the NCAA or &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics\"&gt;NAIA&lt;/a&gt;. By 1993, the non-NCAA Division III members had all dropped out, resulting in the WWIAC having the same membership as the WSUC. Under the circumstances, a merger was inevitable. In 1996, Gary Karner was named commissioner of \"both\" the WSUC and the WWIAC. The two conferences formally merged in 1997 to form the current WIAC.\nEffective with the 2001\u201302 academic year, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20University\"&gt;Lawrence University&lt;/a&gt; joined the conference in the sport of wrestling. Three Minnesota schools, &lt;a href=\"Gustavus%20Adolphus%20College\"&gt;Gustavus Adolphus College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamline%20University\"&gt;Hamline University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winona%20State%20University\"&gt;Winona State University&lt;/a&gt;, became members of the conference in the sport of women's gymnastics during the 2004\u201305 academic year. In 2009\u201310, the conference added men\u2019s soccer as a sponsored sport with the announcement of Michigan school &lt;a href=\"Finlandia%20University\"&gt;Finlandia University&lt;/a&gt; as an affiliate member. Lawrence discontinued its affiliation with the WIAC in wrestling.\nThe conference remained unusually stable over the years; the only changes in full membership being the departures of UW\u2013Milwaukee in 1964 and UW\u2013Superior in 2015.\nCentennial celebration.\nThe ninth-oldest conference in the nation, the WIAC celebrated its centennial year during the 2012\u201313 academic year. Additionally, the WIAC is the most successful NCAA Division III conference in history, boasting NCAA National Championships in 15 different sports. At the beginning of the 2011\u201312 academic year, the conference had claimed a nation-leading 92 NCAA National Championships.\nTo celebrate its centennial, the conference named All-Time Teams in each sport that is currently or was previously recognized as a \"championship\" sport within the conference. Furthermore, the WIAC commissioned a commemorative work of art, created by Tim Cortes, and has also created a two-year calendar in celebration of its centennial.\nThe celebration was headlined by its Centennial Banquet held on August 4, 2012, at the &lt;a href=\"Alliant%20Energy%20Center\"&gt;Alliant Energy Center&lt;/a&gt; in Madison, Wisconsin. Among the honorees at the event were the All-Time Team members and the inaugural class to the WIAC Hall of Fame.\nSports.\nMember institutions field men's and women's teams in &lt;a href=\"cross%20country%20running\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diving%20%28sport%29\"&gt;diving&lt;/a&gt;. Men's teams are fielded for &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"collegiate%20wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt;. Women's teams are fielded for &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"softball\"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;. The WIAC is the only NCAA Division III all-sports conference that does not sponsor men's soccer.\nNational championship teams.\nUW-Oshkosh: 1985, 1994\nUW-Whitewater: 2005, 2014\nUW-Whitewater: 1984, 1989, 2012, 2014\nUW-Platteville: 1991, 1995, 1998, 1999\nUW-Stevens Point: 2004, 2005, 2010, 2015\nUW-Oshkosh: 2019\nUW-Stevens Point: 1987, 2002\nUW-Oshkosh: 1996\nUW-Oshkosh: 1988, 1989, 1990, 2002\nUW-La Crosse: 1996, 2001, 2005\nUW-Eau Claire: 2015\nUW-La Crosse: 1983\nUW-Oshkosh: 1987, 1988, 1991, 1996\nUW-Eau Claire: 2009\nUW-La Crosse: 1992, 1995\nUW-Whitewater: 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014\nUW-Eau Claire: 2001\nUW-River Falls: 1988, 1994\nUW-Stevens Point: 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 2016, 2019\nUW-Superior: 2002\nUW-Eau Claire: 2013\nUW-Stevens Point: 1998\nUW-Eau Claire: 2008\nUW-La Crosse: 1987, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2017\nUW-Oshkosh: 2009\nUW-Eau Claire: 2015, 2016\nUW-La Crosse: 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017\nUW-Oshkosh: 2009\nUW-Oshkosh: 1994-96, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014\nUW-La Crosse: 2015\nUW-La Crosse: 1983, 1984, 2015\nUW-Oshkosh: 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011\nUW-River Falls: 2008\nUW-Whitewater: 2002, 2005\nUW-Eau Claire: 2021"
