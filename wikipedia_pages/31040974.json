    "text": "Erich Klibansky (28 November 1900 in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20am%20Main\"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 24 July 1942 near &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;) was headmaster and teacher of &lt;a href=\"Jawne\"&gt;Jawne&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nKlibansky, who came from a family of &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;s originally located in &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt;, was born in Frankfurt am Main. His father directed there a known interdenominational boarding school, which his son also attended. Afterwards Klibansky attended the Frankfurt &lt;a href=\"Goethe-Gymnasium%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29\"&gt;Goethe-Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; and studied &lt;a href=\"History\"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20studies\"&gt;German studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romance%20studies\"&gt;Romance studies&lt;/a&gt; at university in Frankfurt am Main, &lt;a href=\"Marburg\"&gt;Marburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in Marburg in 1925 with a thesis on \u201cThe topographic changes of the Frankfurt archbishop\u2019s authorities in Hesse\u201c.\nFrom his marriage with Meta David from &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, he had three sons: Hans-Raphael, Alexander and Michael. In the spring of 1929 the family relocated to Cologne, where he purchased a spacious apartment in a house in Volksgartenstra\u00dfe.\nWorks.\nIn the same year, as a probationary teacher, he became headmaster of the high school Jawne in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, which had been created ten years before. Despite the hardships of the incipient economic crisis, Klibansky succeeded to assure the school's survival. As the school, being private, did not receive any &lt;a href=\"subsidy\"&gt;subsidy&lt;/a&gt;, he raised funds for reconstruction and renovation, so that with the school fee of &lt;a href=\"Reichsmark\"&gt;400 marks&lt;/a&gt; the operation of the school was assured.\nUnder Klibansky the school got a continuously growing level of esteem from the whole Jewish population of Cologne. After the &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;s took power in Germany in 1933 and with the growing &lt;a href=\"discrimination\"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; of the Jews of Cologne, Klibanksy did not have many illusions concerning his future in Germany.\nThe salvation of his \"English classes\".\nAs a consequence of the increasing pressure on the Jews the Klibansky family had to leave their apartment in Volksgartenstra\u00dfe, and moved into narrow rooms in Kamekestra\u00dfe at the end of 1937. During this period, Klibansky conceived a plan to use the good language knowledge of his \"English Classes\", that he prepared for the &lt;a href=\"C2%20Proficiency\"&gt;Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency&lt;/a&gt;, for an emigration to &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the approval of the Central Reich Office for Emigration he found in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; support for his plan from important Jewish personalities. The Central British Council for Refugees arranged for the accommodation in a college for his students. Before the breakout of the war in 1939 he was able to send five classes with a total of 130 students to Britain; afterwards the borders were closed.\nAssassination and tribute.\nKlibansky and his whole family were deported from Cologne in July 1942. During the transport to an unknown destination they were all shot in a wooded area near &lt;a href=\"Maly%20Trostenets%20extermination%20camp\"&gt;Blagowschtschin&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt; in a prepared pit.\nIn 1990 a square in Cologne, the &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Klibansky%20Platz\"&gt;Erich Klibansky Platz&lt;/a&gt;, was dedicated to him. Five &lt;a href=\"Stolperstein\"&gt;Stolperstein&lt;/a&gt;e (\"stumbling blocks\") by artist &lt;a href=\"Gunter%20Demnig\"&gt;Gunter Demnig&lt;/a&gt; commemorating Klibansky and his family are installed in front of their home in the Volksgartenstra\u00dfe in Cologne."
