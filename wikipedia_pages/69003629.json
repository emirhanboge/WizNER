He was the Sarkin Madinawa and was appointed an Imam at Kadawa, &lt;a href=\"Warawa\"&gt;Warawa&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Kano%20Emirate%20Council\"&gt;Kano Emirate Council&lt;/a&gt;, during his tenure as an imam he advanced the acceptance of the Maliki School of thought in the Emirate by influencing later scholars to use the principles of the Maliki school of thought instead of the other Islamic school of thoughts, the Maliki school is one of the four major &lt;a href=\"madhhab\"&gt;madhhab&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Fiqh\"&gt;Islamic jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Sunni%20Islam\"&gt;Sunni Islam&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded by &lt;a href=\"Malik%20ibn%20Anas\"&gt;Malik ibn Anas&lt;/a&gt; in the 8th century. The Maliki school of jurisprudence relies on the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hadith\"&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt;s as primary sources. Unlike other Islamic &lt;a href=\"fiqh\"&gt;fiqh&lt;/a&gt;s, Maliki fiqh also considers the consensus of the people of &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; to be a valid source of &lt;a href=\"Sharia\"&gt;Islamic law&lt;/a&gt;, the Maliki madhhab is one of the largest groups of Sunni Muslims, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Shafi%60i\"&gt;Shafi`i&lt;/a&gt; madhhab in adherents, but smaller than the &lt;a href=\"Hanafi\"&gt;Hanafi&lt;/a&gt; madhhab. &lt;a href=\"Sharia\"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; based on Maliki doctrine is predominantly found in &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; (excluding northern and eastern Egypt), &lt;a href=\"West%20Africa\"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, the Emirate of Dubai (&lt;a href=\"UAE\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;), and in northeastern parts of &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.Historical accounts report that he practiced zuhd asceticism. In the Kano Emirate he was regarded by some people as a Saint (&lt;a href=\"Wali\"&gt;Wali&lt;/a&gt;yi), he was buried at Kadawa, there is no record of the date of his death in the history books of the Emirate.\nImam Ghali held the opinion that Muslims must believe in the &lt;a href=\"Five%20pillars%20of%20Islam\"&gt;Five pillars of Islam&lt;/a&gt;, in all the &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Prophets of Islam&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Adam%20in%20Islam\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; to Prophet Muhammad and in &lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20Islam\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;, he also held the beliefs about Allah's attributes that are unique such as existence, permanence without beginning, endurance without end, absoluteness and independence, dissimilarity to created things, Oneness, Allah is all powerful, willful, knowing, living, seeing, hearing and speaking (signifying attributes), his descendants and followers are presently divided into the &lt;a href=\"Izala%20Society\"&gt;Izala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qadiriya\"&gt;Qadiriya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tijaniya\"&gt;Tijaniya&lt;/a&gt; with the Tijjaniya taking the majority among his descendants while a few are sectless. One of the Imams of Kadawa Mosque, Warawa Local Government Sheikh Usaini Umar (Malam Bala) is his descendant.\nHis dynasty was influential in the Kano Emirate after the Kano Civil War which saw the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Aliyu%20Babba\"&gt;Aliyu Babba&lt;/a&gt; as the Emir of KanoThe dynasty he established has produced numerous imams, islamic theologians, traditional title holders, bureaucrats and politicians in the &lt;a href=\"Sokoto%20Caliphate\"&gt;Sokoto Caliphate&lt;/a&gt;,\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kano%20Emirate\"&gt;Kano Emirate&lt;/a&gt; his descendants are referred to as Awliya Madinawa Malamai by some people, in reference to the city of &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; where they claimed to have originated from, situated in Western &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and most of their ancestors being saints.His descendants who are descent of the &lt;a href=\"Jobawa\"&gt;Jobawa&lt;/a&gt; clan on the maternal side are entitled to be appointed as Makaman Kano, due to the precedence established during the reign of Sarkin Kano &lt;a href=\"Aliyu%20Babba\"&gt;Aliyu Babba&lt;/a&gt;, who appointed Sarkin Takai Umaru Dan Maisaje as Makaman Kano, whose link with the Jobawa is through his father's mother Habiba, the sister of Malam Bakatsine, the traditional requisite of agnatic descent was not considered in the appointment leading to the establishment of a precedence for the descendants of the Jobawa with paternal or maternal links to aspire to be appointed as Makaman Kano."
