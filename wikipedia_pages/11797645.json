    "text": "1995\u201396 in &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; was the fourth season of independent football after the split-up from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first of two seasons in Armenia that were different from the others. Including the 1996\u201397 season these were the only winter competitions, while all other Armenian seasons were summer competitions. The &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Armenian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; for 1995\u201396 consisted of 12 teams of which the lowest ranked team would relegate to the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20First%20League\"&gt;Armenian First League&lt;/a&gt;. The eleventh ranked team would face the second ranked team from the First League in a promotion/relegation play-off."
