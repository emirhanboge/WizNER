    "text": "The Borrowers is a 1997 &lt;a href=\"fantasy%20comedy\"&gt;fantasy comedy&lt;/a&gt; film directed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hewitt%20%28director%29\"&gt;Peter Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;. The film stars &lt;a href=\"John%20Goodman\"&gt;John Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Broadbent\"&gt;Jim Broadbent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celia%20Imrie\"&gt;Celia Imrie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Williams%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Mark Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Laurie\"&gt;Hugh Laurie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20Pierce\"&gt;Bradley Pierce&lt;/a&gt;. The film is loosely based on the 1952 &lt;a href=\"The%20Borrowers\"&gt;children's novel of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Norton%20%28author%29\"&gt;Mary Norton&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, it was nominated for Best British Film in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts\"&gt;British Academy of Film and Television Arts&lt;/a&gt; (BAFTA) awards, but lost to &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Oldman\"&gt;Gary Oldman&lt;/a&gt;'s film \"&lt;a href=\"Nil%20by%20Mouth%20%28film%29\"&gt;Nil by Mouth&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSome of the film's scenes were shot on location in the village of &lt;a href=\"Theale\"&gt;Theale&lt;/a&gt;, near Reading, Berkshire, where all of the buildings and shops in the High Street were painted dark green. When the film was released in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, it opened on No. 2, behind \"&lt;a href=\"Alien%20Resurrection\"&gt;Alien Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;\". The next week, the film regained the position, though under \"&lt;a href=\"Tomorrow%20Never%20Dies\"&gt;Tomorrow Never Dies&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nYoung Pete Lender sets up traps throughout his home, explaining to his parents, Joe and Victoria, that small household items, which they believe are simply misplaced, are being stolen. In actuality, the Clock family of tiny people known as \"Borrowers\" are secretly living in the house, taking things without being seen by \"human beans\". &lt;a href=\"Lawyer\"&gt;Lawyer&lt;/a&gt; Ocious P. Potter informs the Lenders that he cannot find the &lt;a href=\"will%20and%20testament\"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; of Victoria\u2019s late aunt Mary Alabaster \u2013 the family\u2019s only evidence that their house rightfully belongs to them \u2013 and he has already made plans to demolish their house and build &lt;a href=\"condominium\"&gt;condominium&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the Lenders to move.\nPod Clock and his children, Arrietty and Peagreen, make their way through the kitchen to \"borrow\" a battery to bring back to his wife, Homily. Arrietty treats herself to ice cream in the freezer, and is accidentally trapped inside as the Lenders return. Pod rescues her via the ice dispenser, but is forced to leave one of his gadgets behind. Later, Arrietty ventures out alone and is caught by Pete, who explains that the house is being demolished in the absence of the will. Arrietty warns her family and, despite her parents\u2019 misgivings, Pod reluctantly agrees and Pete smuggles the Clocks onto the Lenders\u2019 moving truck to join them at their new home. Pete repairs and returns Pod\u2019s gadget to him, earning his trust. As the truck pulls away, Arrietty and Peagreen accidentally fall out, and make their way back to the house.\nPotter soon arrives at the house, revealing that he lied to the Lenders; having a distrust of banks, Mrs. Alabaster had actually hidden her will \u2013 &lt;a href=\"bequest\"&gt;officially leaving her property&lt;/a&gt; to the family \u2013 inside the house. He finds the will in a hidden safe and prepares to burn it, but Arrietty and Peagreen flee with the document. Discovering the Clocks\u2019 home beneath the floorboards, Potter summons &lt;a href=\"pest%20control\"&gt;Exterminator&lt;/a&gt; Jeff to eliminate the Borrowers, and is sprayed with caustic foam and electrocuted in the process. Police Officer Oliver Steady responds to the disturbance, but Potter manages to throw off his suspicions while Arrietty and Peagreen escape with the will. \nPeagreen accidentally stumbles and falls into an empty milk bottle and is &lt;a href=\"milk%20delivery\"&gt;collected and brought back&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"dairy\"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt;, with Potter, Jeff, and Jeff\u2019s &lt;a href=\"flatulence\"&gt;flatulent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bloodhound\"&gt;bloodhound&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit, followed by Pete, Pod, and Homily. Spud Spiller, an \"outie\" Borrower living on the street, takes Arrietty to the dairy, where Pod rescues Peagreen from the &lt;a href=\"assembly%20line\"&gt;assembly line&lt;/a&gt;. Potter captures the Borrowers and leaves them to drown in liquid cheese. Spiller taunts Potter, who drops him in a machine, seemingly killing him, and departs with the will. Pete saves the Clocks, and Jeff, realizing Potter's scheme, has a change of heart and drives them to City Hall to stop Potter from arranging the house\u2019s demolition.\nIn retaliation for Potter\u2019s rudeness, the City Hall clerk gives him confusing directions. Eventually reaching the demolitions office, Potter is confronted by Jeff and Pete, but then pushes them out of the way. He then enters the office, only to find himself tricked and locked in a supply room. The Clocks tie him up with &lt;a href=\"electrical%20tape\"&gt;electrical tape&lt;/a&gt;, but he breaks free and recaptures them. Before Potter can &lt;a href=\"vacuum%20cleaner\"&gt;vacuum up&lt;/a&gt; the family, Spiller arrives with an army of Borrowers who subdue him, and Pod delivers a warning to Potter on behalf of all Borrowers. They disappear as Pete and Jeff arrive with Officer Steady. Pete shows Steady the will, proving Potter\u2019s plan to cheat the Lenders out of their house, and Potter is promptly arrested.\nThe Lenders move back into their home, as do the Clocks, now with food and assistance from Pete. As the Clocks enjoy the company of their old Borrower friends, Minty Branch, Swag Moss and Dustbunny Bin, Arrietty and Spiller sneak away to ride his &lt;a href=\"aerosol%20paint\"&gt;aerosol paint&lt;/a&gt;-propelled roller skate. \nDuring the pre-credits, Potter attempts to explain the existence of the Borrowers, only for the whole stationboth cops and convictsto laugh at him uproariously. The film closes with Potter getting his mugshots taken (which he actually seems to enjoy).\nCast.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Aden%20Gillett\"&gt;Aden Gillett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doon%20Mackichan\"&gt;Doon Mackichan&lt;/a&gt; play Pete's father and mother, respectively.\nReception.\nThe film received generally positive reviews upon its release. On &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; the film has an approval rating of 73% based on reviews from 26 critics. Audiences surveyed by &lt;a href=\"CinemaScore\"&gt;CinemaScore&lt;/a&gt; gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" has described the film as \"A spirited screen version of the Mary Norton stories about the tiny folk who live under the floorboards, and off human scraps. &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Broadbent\"&gt;Jim Broadbent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celia%20Imrie\"&gt;Celia Imrie&lt;/a&gt; are a joy as the parents of little Arrietty...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Roger%20Ebert\"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; in his review described the film, in the wake of numerous television adaptations, as a \"big-screen, big-budget version with special effects so amusing it's like \"&lt;a href=\"Toy%20Story\"&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt;\" has come to life...the charm comes in the way \"The Borrowers\" makes its world look like a timeless story book. If the action and the physical humour are designed to appeal to kids, the look of the film will impress adults who know what to look for.\"\nHome media.\nThis film was released on 19 May 1998, on VHS and on 1 April 2003 on DVD."
