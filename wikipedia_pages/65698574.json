    "text": "Grace United Methodist Church is a &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; church in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Originally organized as a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20mission\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in 1871, the current &lt;a href=\"church%20building\"&gt;church building&lt;/a&gt; was designed by &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Palmer%20Smith\"&gt;Francis Palmer Smith&lt;/a&gt; and was completed in 1923.\nHistory.\nThe church was founded in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in 1871 as St. John's Mission. The church adopted its current name 12 years later. The church, initially part of the &lt;a href=\"Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20South\"&gt;Methodist Episcopal Church, South&lt;/a&gt;, changed locations several times in the first few decades of its existence. By 1883, it was located in a building at the intersection of Wheat Street (now &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20Avenue\"&gt;Auburn Avenue&lt;/a&gt;) and Jackson Street. In 1906, the church moved to a building at the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Boulevard%20%28Atlanta%29\"&gt;Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Avenue%20%28Atlanta%29\"&gt;Highland Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. This building was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Atlanta%20Fire%20of%201917\"&gt;Great Atlanta Fire of 1917&lt;/a&gt;, and shortly thereafter, the church used the insurance money from the destruction to purchase a property on &lt;a href=\"Ponce%20de%20Leon%20Avenue\"&gt;Ponce de Leon Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. In 1918, the church built a &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20school\"&gt;Sunday school&lt;/a&gt; building on the property. Several years later, in 1922, &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Palmer%20Smith\"&gt;Francis Palmer Smith&lt;/a&gt; was hired to design a new &lt;a href=\"church%20building\"&gt;church building&lt;/a&gt; at the site. According to a historian of Smith's, this project would be the \"first large &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical\"&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/a&gt; project of Smith's career\". Smith designed this new church building in a &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic Revival&lt;/a&gt; style, with the building trimmed with &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Limestone\"&gt;Indiana Limestone&lt;/a&gt;. Smith would go on to design several church buildings throughout Atlanta.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt;, the church was the site of an effort towards church &lt;a href=\"Desegregation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;desegregation&lt;/a&gt; when, on August 7, 1960, a small interracial group attended Sunday services at the church. This was part of a city-wide campaign towards church desegregation, as interracial groups attended services at other churches that day, including &lt;a href=\"First%20Presbyterian%20Church%20of%20Atlanta\"&gt;First Presbyterian Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mark%20United%20Methodist%20Church%20%28Atlanta%29\"&gt;St. Mark Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the early 21st century, financial difficulties lead to the possibility that the church would close or relocate. However, in 2016, it was announced that the General Board of Global Ministries, a branch of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist%20Church\"&gt;United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt;, would relocate from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to Atlanta, and in the process would purchase the property belonging to Grace, allowing them to stay and continue to hold services in the building. To make room for the new group, the church held an &lt;a href=\"estate%20sale\"&gt;estate sale&lt;/a&gt; that year."
