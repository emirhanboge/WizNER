    "text": "Caravan (; pl. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, \"caravanim\") is an Israeli term referring to a &lt;a href=\"portable%20building\"&gt;portable building&lt;/a&gt; used as a living space, school classroom, &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt;, or community center.\nDescription.\n\"Caravanim\" are constructed of &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; or other metal siding with a &lt;a href=\"corrugated%20metal\"&gt;corrugated metal&lt;/a&gt; roof, and are often attached to a cement-block base. They are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity.\nThe establishment of \"caravanim\" on disputed land by &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; activists is considered the first step toward the establishment of an &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20settlement\"&gt;Israeli settlement&lt;/a&gt;. In its initial stage of a few \"caravanim\", the establishment is called an \"&lt;a href=\"Israeli%20outpost\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\" As more settlers move in, the establishment is upgraded to a \"settlement\".\nAlternately, \"caravanim\" have been established on disputed land by Israeli and Palestinian activists as a sign of protest.\nClassrooms.\n\"Caravanim\" are popularly employed by schools \u2014 especially in &lt;a href=\"Haredi%20Judaism\"&gt;Haredi&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods of Israel \u2014 that are unable to finance a permanent structure. A 2008 report by the &lt;a href=\"State%20Comptroller%20of%20Israel\"&gt;State Comptroller of Israel&lt;/a&gt; reported that 125 out of 186 Haredi schools in &lt;a href=\"Bnei%20Brak\"&gt;Bnei Brak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El%27ad\"&gt;Elad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modi%27in%20Illit\"&gt;Modi'in Illit&lt;/a&gt; were situated wholly or partially in \"caravanim\", some older than 15 years. The report criticized these structures for lack of ventilation, lack of bomb shelters, and lack of proper yards or playgrounds for the children. Though the construction of some \"caravan\" schools violate local planning and building laws, the government does not dismantle them.\nSynagogues.\nMany start-up religious congregations establish their synagogues in \"caravanim\" rather than the more expensive permanent concrete-and-stone structures. Synagogues housed in \"caravanim\" are common sights at &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Israel army&lt;/a&gt; bases.\nLiving space.\n\"Caravanim\" are sometimes used as inexpensive houses in new or extensions of existing localities within Israel.\nSettler housing.\nMost often, \"caravanim\" are employed by both settlers and the government as housing in Israeli settlement areas in &lt;a href=\"Israeli-occupied%20territories\"&gt;the territories occupied since 1967&lt;/a&gt;. Residents usually live in \"caravanim\" until permanent homes are built. The \"caravan\" may also be a more permanent low-rent option, particularly for young couples.\nThe overnight installment of \"caravanim\" for housing is a popular means of establishing a new, unauthorized settler outpost on disputed land.\nCaravillas.\nIn 2005 prefabricated homes, named \"caravillas\" (), a &lt;a href=\"Portmanteau%20word\"&gt;portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; of the words \"caravan\" and &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;, were set up to house the Jewish families evicted from their homes in &lt;a href=\"Gush%20Katif\"&gt;Gush Katif&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gaza%20Strip\"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Israel%27s%20unilateral%20disengagement%20plan\"&gt;Israel's unilateral disengagement plan&lt;/a&gt;.\nA \"caravilla\" is composed of several prefabricated sections that are joined on a foundation. \"Caravillas\", which vary in size from about 650 to 1,000 square feet, are akin to the Israeli concept of a villa, or &lt;a href=\"single-family%20home\"&gt;single-family home&lt;/a&gt;. They were instrumental in pacifying objections to the disengagement plan. The biggest of these \"caravilla camps\" was established in &lt;a href=\"Nitzan\"&gt;Nitzan&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Ashkelon\"&gt;Ashkelon&lt;/a&gt; with 250 \"caravillas\", which has grown to accommodate over 500."
