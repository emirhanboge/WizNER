    "text": "The 2012 United States presidential election in Vermont took place on November 6, 2012, as part of the &lt;a href=\"2012%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2012 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt; in which all 50 states plus the &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; participated. &lt;a href=\"Vermont\"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; voters chose three electors to represent them in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Electoral%20College\"&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; via a popular vote pitting &lt;a href=\"incumbent\"&gt;incumbent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and his running mate, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, against &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; challenger and former &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; and his running mate, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Ryan\"&gt;Paul Ryan&lt;/a&gt;.\nA very &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Northeastern&lt;/a&gt; state, and a former bastion of progressive Republicanism until the realignment election of &lt;a href=\"1992%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Vermont was the second most Democratic state in the nation, weighing in as a whopping 31.74% more Democratic than the national average in the 2012 election. Repeating his success from &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Obama again carried Vermont in a landslide, taking 66.57% of the vote to Romney's 30.97%, a Democratic victory margin of 35.60%. Though this was slightly worse than his 2008 performance, when he received 67.46% of the vote to Republican Senator &lt;a href=\"John%20McCain\"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;'s 30.45%, a margin of 37.01%, this was still the second best performance for a Democrat in Vermont history, surpassing &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1964%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; performance.\nVermont historically was a bastion of northeastern Republicanism, voting Republican in every single election but one between &lt;a href=\"1856%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;1856&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1988%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;, interrupted only in &lt;a href=\"1964%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Vermont\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;. It also elected solely Republican &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Vermont\"&gt;governors&lt;/a&gt; from 1854 to &lt;a href=\"1962%20Vermont%20gubernatorial%20election\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;. However, after migration from liberal northeastern cities such as &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to Vermont in the 1960s and 70s, it shifted sharply towards the Democratic Party with &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s landslide victory in 1992, and has been part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20wall%20%28politics%29\"&gt;Blue Wall&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 the 19 jurisdictions, worth 238 electoral votes, that voted Democratic six times in a row from 1992 through 2012 \u2013 ever since. Vermont also has one of the greenest economies in the country, with its own Clean Air Act and a state trust that buys farmland to support local farming. This, and a virtual nonexistence of party loyalty in the state, guaranteed Obama's landslide victory. The Green Mountain State's &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Vermont\"&gt;original constitution&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism\"&gt;abolished&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; and provided &lt;a href=\"Universal%20manhood%20suffrage\"&gt;universal male suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, and the state government legalized &lt;a href=\"Same-sex%20civil%20unions%20in%20the%20united%20states\"&gt;same-sex civil unions&lt;/a&gt; in July 2000, &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, and &lt;a href=\"Decriminalization%20of%20non-medical%20cannabis%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;decriminalized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cannabis%20%28drug%29\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.\nObama's best performance was in &lt;a href=\"Windham%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Windham County&lt;/a&gt;, where he received 73.06% of the vote, though he also racked up great margins in &lt;a href=\"Chittenden%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Chittenden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rutland%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Rutland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Washington Counties&lt;/a&gt;, the state's three largest counties and home to Burlington, &lt;a href=\"Rutland%20%28city%29%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Rutland&lt;/a&gt;, and the state capital of &lt;a href=\"Montpelier%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Montpelier&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The only county where he won by a margin of less than 20% is in &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Essex County&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Kingdom\"&gt;Northeast Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, generally the most conservative region in the state, where he won by 13.40%.\nThe results of the 2012 election made Vermont the second most Democratic state in the nation, only surpassed by the 42.71% margin in Obama's birth state of &lt;a href=\"2012%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of 2020, this is the last election in which the Democrat won &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Essex County&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension, every county in the state.\nDemocratic primary.\nThe Democratic primary took place on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Tuesday\"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, March 6, 2012. &lt;a href=\"Incumbent\"&gt;Incumbent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; ran unopposed. According to the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Vermont\"&gt;Secretary of State of Vermont&lt;/a&gt;'s office, he received 40,247 votes (97.28%) and all of the 27 delegates attending the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention\"&gt;2012 Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; pledged to support his re-nomination.

Three &lt;a href=\"superdelegate\"&gt;superdelegate&lt;/a&gt;s are bound by the primary results and awarded on a winner-take-all basis. The remaining 14 are awarded winner-take-all to the candidate who wins at least 50% of the vote statewide, or allocated proportionately among candidates winning at least 20% of the vote statewide if no one gets a majority.\nFormer &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; won the primary with a plurality, receiving 24,008 votes (39.45%) and 9 delegates. He won every single county. &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Texas%27s%2014th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Texas's 14th district&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Paul\"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; placed in second with 15,391 votes, or 25.29%, while former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Santorum\"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; received 14,368 votes, or 23.61%.
