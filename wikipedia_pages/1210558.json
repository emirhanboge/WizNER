    "text": "Victoria Bryant State Park is a 502-&lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; (2.03\u00a0km2) &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"state%20park\"&gt;state park&lt;/a&gt; located near &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Springs%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Franklin Springs&lt;/a&gt;. Nestled in the rolling hills of Georgia's &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20plateau\"&gt;Piedmont plateau&lt;/a&gt;, this park offers facilities ranging from picnic sites and a &lt;a href=\"swimming%20pool\"&gt;swimming pool&lt;/a&gt; to an 18-hole &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt;. The North Fork of the &lt;a href=\"Broad%20River%20%28Georgia%29\"&gt;Broad River&lt;/a&gt; flows through the park, adding several water &lt;a href=\"hazard\"&gt;hazard&lt;/a&gt;s to the course. The park also offers a short nature trail plus a long perimeter trail that takes hikers through &lt;a href=\"hardwood\"&gt;hardwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, the park is home to many species of &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe site was originally owned by Paul Bryant, who donated the land in the early 1950s as a state park, with the condition it be named after his late mother, Victoria Bryant."
