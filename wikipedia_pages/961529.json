    "text": "The Tararua District is an area near the south-east corner of &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"North%20Island\"&gt;North Island&lt;/a&gt; that is administered by the Tararua District Council. It has a population of and an area of 4,360.56 km\u00b2. The Tararua District Council was created by the amalgamation of the Dannevirke Borough, Eketahuna County Council, Pahiatua Borough Council, Pahiatua County Council and Woodville District Council in the &lt;a href=\"1989%20local%20government%20reforms\"&gt;1989 local government reforms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe district's northwest boundary runs along the top of the &lt;a href=\"Ruahine%20Range\"&gt;Ruahine Range&lt;/a&gt;; its south-east boundary is the Pacific Ocean. The catchment of the &lt;a href=\"Manawatu%20River\"&gt;Manawatu River&lt;/a&gt; generally defines the north and south extremities. The catchment is also the reason the majority of the district is in the &lt;a href=\"Manawat%C5%AB-Whanganui\"&gt;Manawat\u016b-Whanganui&lt;/a&gt; Region, although traditionally many of the people of the district regard themselves as living in either &lt;a href=\"Hawke%27s%20Bay%20%28region%29\"&gt;Hawke's Bay&lt;/a&gt; (in the north) or &lt;a href=\"Wairarapa\"&gt;Wairarapa&lt;/a&gt; (in the south).\nTowns and regional government.\nThe district's chief town is &lt;a href=\"Dannevirke\"&gt;Dannevirke&lt;/a&gt;, settled by immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century. It is also the centre for a Community Board. Other towns (from south to north along the main valleys) include &lt;a href=\"Eketahuna\"&gt;Eketahuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pahiatua\"&gt;Pahiatua&lt;/a&gt;, which have their own Community Boards, and &lt;a href=\"Woodville%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Woodville&lt;/a&gt;, Ormondville, and &lt;a href=\"Norsewood\"&gt;Norsewood&lt;/a&gt;. Near the coast are &lt;a href=\"Pongaroa\"&gt;Pongaroa&lt;/a&gt;, Herbertville, &lt;a href=\"%C4%80kitio\"&gt;\u0100kitio&lt;/a&gt;, and Alfredton.\nWhile the vast majority (98.42% by land area) of Tararua District is part of the Manawatu-Wanganui Region, a small triangle of rural land (1.58% by land area) north of the Owahanga River in the southeast of the district is part of &lt;a href=\"Wellington%20Region\"&gt;Wellington Region&lt;/a&gt;. According to the 2006 Census this area, known as Mara, has only 3 residents (down from 12 in 1996 and 2001).\nDemographics.\nTararua District had a population of 17,943 at the &lt;a href=\"2018%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2018 New Zealand census&lt;/a&gt;, an increase of 1,089 people (6.5%) since the &lt;a href=\"2013%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2013 census&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase of 309 people (1.8%) since the &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2006 census&lt;/a&gt;. There were 6,996 households. There were 8,916 males and 9,027 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 41.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 3,876 people (21.6%) aged under 15 years, 2,883 (16.1%) aged 15 to 29, 7,899 (44.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,285 (18.3%) aged 65 or older.\nEthnicities were 84.5% European/P\u0101keh\u0101, 24.6% M\u0101ori, 1.9% Pacific peoples, 2.7% Asian, and 1.4% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).\nThe proportion of people born overseas was 8.7%, compared with 27.1% nationally.\nAlthough some people objected to giving their religion, 49.6% had no religion, 36.7% were Christian, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 4.5% had other religions.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 1,431 (10.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 3,897 (27.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,300, compared with $31,800 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 6,459 (45.9%) people were employed full-time, 2,298 (16.3%) were part-time, and 567 (4.0%) were unemployed.\n\"Forty-Mile Bush\".\nWhen Europeans settled the area, it was almost entirely forested and was called \"Forty-Mile Bush\". Industrious clearance has made it a busy pastoral district, although the region close to the Pacific coast is still sparsely populated. The original name lives on in that of the local &lt;a href=\"National%20Provincial%20Championship%20%282006%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;National Provincial Championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; team, Wairarapa-Bush.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is the district's main industry. Other industries include textiles, food processing, and retailing. Commercial forestry is expected to become more important to the district's economy in the next few years.\nWeather forecasts.\nBefore 2006, weather forecasts on &lt;a href=\"National%20Radio%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;National Radio&lt;/a&gt; (as provided by &lt;a href=\"Meteorological%20Service%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Limited\"&gt;MetService&lt;/a&gt;) had usually mentioned Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa but rarely if ever Tararua District, probably leaving Tararua District residents wondering which applied to them when the forecasts differed.\nOfficially it is considered a sub-region of the &lt;a href=\"Wairarapa\"&gt;Wairarapa&lt;/a&gt; district. Since early in 2006, Met Service policy is that a separate Tararua District forecast will be issued only if the expected weather in that area differs significantly from the other sub-regions (&lt;a href=\"Masterton\"&gt;Masterton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carterton%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Carterton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Wairarapa%20District\"&gt;South Wairarapa&lt;/a&gt;). However, by the time the forecast is actually broadcast over National Radio (at least until early March 2006), Tararua District is simply listed as a separate District if it is mentioned at all (commonly in the phrase \"Tararua and Wairarapa\"), and if it is mentioned separately or bracketed with other areas apart from Wairarapa there is no indication that the Wairarapa forecast excludes Tararua District.\nSchools.\nSecondary\nPrimary"
