    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"logic\"&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt;, a direct proof is a way of showing the\n&lt;a href=\"truth\"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of\nestablished facts, usually &lt;a href=\"axiom\"&gt;axiom&lt;/a&gt;s, existing &lt;a href=\"lemma%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;lemma&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"theorem\"&gt;theorem&lt;/a&gt;s, without making any further assumptions. In order to directly prove a &lt;a href=\"Material%20conditional\"&gt;conditional&lt;/a&gt; statement of the form \"If \"p\", then \"q\"\", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement \"p\" is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably &lt;a href=\"first-order%20logic\"&gt;first-order logic&lt;/a&gt;, employing the quantifiers \"for all\" and \"there exists\". Common proof rules used are &lt;a href=\"modus%20ponens\"&gt;modus ponens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"universal%20instantiation\"&gt;universal instantiation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn contrast, an &lt;a href=\"indirect%20proof\"&gt;indirect proof&lt;/a&gt; may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly \"p\" \u21d2 \"q\", one proves its &lt;a href=\"contrapositive\"&gt;contrapositive&lt;/a&gt; ~\"q\" \u21d2 ~\"p\" (one assumes ~\"q\" and shows that it leads to ~\"p\"). Since \"p\" \u21d2 \"q\" and ~\"q\" \u21d2 ~\"p\" are equivalent by the principle of &lt;a href=\"transposition%20%28logic%29\"&gt;transposition&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"law%20of%20excluded%20middle\"&gt;law of excluded middle&lt;/a&gt;), \"p\" \u21d2 \"q\" is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include &lt;a href=\"proof%20by%20contradiction\"&gt;proof by contradiction&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"proof%20by%20infinite%20descent\"&gt;proof by infinite descent&lt;/a&gt;. Direct proof methods include &lt;a href=\"proof%20by%20exhaustion\"&gt;proof by exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"proof%20by%20induction\"&gt;proof by induction&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory and etymology.\nA direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word \u2018proof\u2019 comes from the Latin word probare, which means \u201cto test\u201d. The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony. In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions \u2013 with populations like the &lt;a href=\"Egyptians\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; showing an interest in surveying land. This led to a natural curiosity with regards to &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trigonometry\"&gt;trigonometry&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 particularly &lt;a href=\"triangles\"&gt;triangles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rectangles\"&gt;rectangles&lt;/a&gt;. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the &lt;a href=\"circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt;, which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20Geometry\"&gt;Euclidean Geometry&lt;/a&gt;) discussed circles.\nThe earliest form of mathematics was &lt;a href=\"phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;phenomenological&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical \u201cfact\u201d. On occasion, &lt;a href=\"analogical\"&gt;analogical&lt;/a&gt; arguments took place, or even by \u201cinvoking the gods\u201d. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.\nProof as we know it came about with one specific question: \u201cwhat is a proof?\u201d Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a &lt;a href=\"comparison%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.\nExamples.\nThe sum of two even integers equals an even integer.\nConsider two &lt;a href=\"Even%20and%20odd%20numbers\"&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; integers and . Since they are even, they can be written as\nrespectively for integers and . \nThen the sum can be written as\nIt follows that has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.\nPythagoras' theorem.\nObserve that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a large square. Each of the triangles has sides \"a\" and \"b\" and hypotenuse \"c\". The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides - in this case, \"(a + b)2\". However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.\nWe know that the area of the large square is equal to \"(a + b)2\".\nThe area of a triangle is equal to formula_5\nWe know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals formula_6\nThese are equal, and so\nAfter some simplifying,\nRemoving the ab that appears on both sides gives\nwhich proves Pythagoras' theorem. \u220e\nThe square of an odd number is also odd.\nBy definition, if \"n\" is an odd integer, it can be expressed as\nfor some integer \"k\". Thus\nSince 2\"k\"2+ 2\"k\" is an integer, \"n\"2 is also odd. \u220e"
