    "text": "The Gujarati script (\u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0ab2\u0abf\u0aaa\u0abf \"Guj\u01cer\u0101t\u012b Lipi\") is an &lt;a href=\"abugida\"&gt;abugida&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20language\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kutchi%20language\"&gt;Kutchi&lt;/a&gt; languages. It is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Devanagari\"&gt;Devanagari&lt;/a&gt; script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a number of modifications to some characters.\nGujarati &lt;a href=\"numerical%20digit\"&gt;numerical digit&lt;/a&gt;s are also different from their Devanagari counterparts.\nOrigin.\nThe Gujarati script(\u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0ab2\u0abf\u0aaa\u0abf) was adapted from the Devanagari script to write the Gujarati language. Gujarati language and script developed in three distinct phases \u2014 10th to 15th century, 15th to 17th century and 17th to 19th century. The first phase is marked by use of &lt;a href=\"Prakrit\"&gt;Prakrit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apabramsa\"&gt;Apabramsa&lt;/a&gt; and its variants such as &lt;a href=\"Paisaci\"&gt;Paisaci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shauraseni\"&gt;Shauraseni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magadhi%20Prakrit\"&gt;Magadhi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maharashtri\"&gt;Maharashtri&lt;/a&gt;. In second phase, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gujarati\"&gt;Old Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; script was in wide use. The earliest known document in the Old Gujarati script is a handwritten manuscript \"Adi Parva\" dating from 1591\u201392, and the script first appeared in print in a 1797 advertisement. The third phase is the use of script developed for ease and fast writing. The use of \"shirorekha\" (the topline as in Devanagari) was abandoned. Until the 19th century it was used mainly for writing letters and keeping accounts, while the Devanagari script was used for literature and academic writings. It is also known as the \"\u015bar\u0101ph\u012b\" (banker's), \"v\u0101\u1e47i\u0101\u015b\u0101\u012b\" (merchant's) or \"mah\u0101jan\u012b\" (trader's) script. This script became the basis of the modern script. Later the same script was adopted by writers of manuscripts. &lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jain&lt;/a&gt; community also promoted its use for copying religious texts by hired writers.\nOverview.\nThe Gujarati writing system is an &lt;a href=\"abugida\"&gt;abugida&lt;/a&gt;, in which each base consonantal character possesses an inherent vowel, that vowel being \"a\" [\u0259]. For postconsonantal vowels other than \"a\", the consonant is applied with &lt;a href=\"diacritic\"&gt;diacritic&lt;/a&gt;s, while for non-postconsonantal vowels (initial and post-vocalic positions), there are full-formed characters. With \"a\" being the most frequent vowel, this is a convenient system in the sense that it cuts down on the width of writing.\nFollowing out of the aforementioned property, consonants lacking a proceeding vowel may condense into the proceeding consonant, forming \"compound\" or \"conjunct\" letters. The formation of these conjuncts follows a system of rules depending on the consonants involved.\nIn accordance with all the other &lt;a href=\"Indic%20scripts\"&gt;Indic scripts&lt;/a&gt;, Gujarati is written from left to right, and is not case-sensitive.\nThe Gujarati script is basically &lt;a href=\"phoneme\"&gt;phonemic&lt;/a&gt;, with a few exceptions. First out of these is the written representation of non-pronounced \"a\"s, which are of three types.\nSecondly and most importantly, being of Sanskrit-based Devanagari, Gujarati's script retains notations for the obsolete (short \"i, u\" vs. long \"\u012b, \u016b\"; \"r\u0325\", \"ru\"; \"\u015b\", \"\u1e63\"), and lacks notations for innovations ( vs. ; vs. ; clear vs. &lt;a href=\"Breathy%20voice\"&gt;murmured&lt;/a&gt; vowels).\nContemporary Gujarati uses &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href=\"punctuation\"&gt;punctuation&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"question%20mark\"&gt;question mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"exclamation%20mark\"&gt;exclamation mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comma\"&gt;comma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"full%20stop\"&gt;full stop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Apostrophe\"&gt;Apostrophe&lt;/a&gt;s are used for the rarely written &lt;a href=\"clitic\"&gt;clitic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Quotation%20mark\"&gt;Quotation mark&lt;/a&gt;s are not as often used for direct quotes. The full stop replaced the traditional &lt;a href=\"vertical%20bar\"&gt;vertical bar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"colon%20%28punctuation%29\"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;, mostly obsolete in its Sanskritic capacity (see &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20script%23Non-vowel%20diacritics\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), follows the European usage.\nUse for Avestan.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrians\"&gt;Zoroastrians&lt;/a&gt; of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, would transcribe Avestan in &lt;a href=\"N%C4%81gar%C4%AB%20script\"&gt;Nagri script&lt;/a&gt;-based scripts as well as the &lt;a href=\"Avestan%20alphabet\"&gt;Avestan alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the ca. 12th century texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, and which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in Gujarati script (&lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20language\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the /z/ in \"zara\u03b8u\u0161tra\" is written with /j/ + dot below.\nInfluence in Southeast Asia.\nMiller (2010) presented a theory that the indigenous scripts of &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Sulawesi\"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt; (Indonesia) and the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; are descended from an early form of the Gujarati script. Historical records show that Gujaratis played a major role in the archipelago, where they were manufacturers and played a key role in introducing &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A9%20Pires\"&gt;Tom\u00e9 Pires&lt;/a&gt; reported a presence of a thousand Gujaratis in &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;) prior to 1512.\nGujarati letters, diacritics, and digits.\nVowels.\n&lt;a href=\"Vowels\"&gt;Vowels&lt;/a&gt; (\"svara\"), in their conventional order, are historically grouped into \"short\" (\"hrasva\") and \"long\" (\"d\u012brgha\") classes, based on the \"light\" (\"laghu\") and \"heavy\" (\"guru\") syllables they create in traditional verse. The historical long vowels \"\u012b\" and \"\u016b\" are no longer distinctively long in pronunciation. Only in verse do syllables containing them assume the values required by meter.\nFinally, a practice of using inverted \"m\u0101tra\"s to represent &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and 's has gained ground.\n\u0ab0 \"r\", \u0a9c \"j\" and \u0ab9 \"h\" form the irregular forms of \u0ab0\u0ac2 \"r\u016b\", \u0a9c\u0ac0 \"j\u012b\" and \u0ab9\u0ac3 \"h\u1e5b\".\nConsonants.\nConsonants (\"vya\u00f1jana\") are grouped in accordance with the traditional, linguistically based &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; scheme of arrangement, which considers the usage and position of the tongue during their &lt;a href=\"pronunciation\"&gt;pronunciation&lt;/a&gt;. In sequence, these categories are: &lt;a href=\"Velar%20consonant\"&gt;velar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"palatal\"&gt;palatal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"retroflex\"&gt;retroflex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dental%20consonant\"&gt;dental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"labial%20consonant\"&gt;labial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sonorant\"&gt;sonorant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fricative\"&gt;fricative&lt;/a&gt;. Among the first five groups, which contain the &lt;a href=\"Stop%20consonant\"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt;s, the ordering starts with the &lt;a href=\"Aspiration%20%28phonetics%29\"&gt;unaspirated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Voice%20%28phonetics%29\"&gt;voiceless&lt;/a&gt;, then goes on through aspirated voiceless, &lt;a href=\"unaspirated\"&gt;unaspirated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"voiced\"&gt;voiced&lt;/a&gt;, and aspirated voiced, ending with the &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20stop\"&gt;Nasal stop&lt;/a&gt;s. Most have a Devanagari counterpart.\nConjuncts.\nAs mentioned, successive consonants lacking a vowel in between them may physically join together as a 'conjunct'. The government of these clusters ranges from widely to narrowly applicable rules, with special exceptions within. While standardized for the most part, there are certain variations in clustering, of which the Unicode used on this page is just one scheme. The rules:\nThe role and nature of &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; must be taken into consideration to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The &lt;a href=\"orthography\"&gt;orthography&lt;/a&gt; of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. &lt;a href=\"Morphology%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;Morphologically&lt;/a&gt; it was highly &lt;a href=\"Synthetic%20language\"&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt;, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more &lt;a href=\"Analytic%20language\"&gt;analytic&lt;/a&gt;, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (\"a\"-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The same can be said of Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.\nAn example attesting to this general theme is that of the series of \"d-\" clusters. These are essentially Sanskrit clusters, using the original Devanagari forms. There are no cluster forms for formations such as \"dta\", \"dka\", etc. because such formations weren't permitted in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit%20phonology\"&gt;Sanskrit phonology&lt;/a&gt; anyway. They are permitted under &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20phonology\"&gt;Gujarati phonology&lt;/a&gt;, but are written unclustered (\u0aaa\u0aa6\u0aa4 \"padata\" \"position\", \u0a95\u0ac2\u0aa6\u0a95\u0acb \"k\u016bdko\" \"leap\"), with patterns such as \"a\"-elision at work instead.\nRomanization.\nGujarati is &lt;a href=\"Romanization\"&gt;romanized&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Wikipedia\"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; in \"standard &lt;a href=\"oriental%20studies\"&gt;orientalist&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Transcription%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;transcription&lt;/a&gt; as outlined in . Being \"primarily a system of &lt;a href=\"transliteration\"&gt;transliteration&lt;/a&gt; from the Indian scripts, [and] based in turn upon &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;\" (cf. &lt;a href=\"IAST\"&gt;IAST&lt;/a&gt;), these are its salient features: &lt;a href=\"Underdot\"&gt;subscript dots&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"retroflex%20consonant\"&gt;retroflex consonant&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Macron%20%28diacritic%29\"&gt;macron&lt;/a&gt;s for etymologically, contrastively &lt;a href=\"long%20vowel\"&gt;long vowel&lt;/a&gt;s; \"h\" denoting &lt;a href=\"Aspiration%20%28phonetics%29\"&gt;aspirated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stop%20consonant\"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Tilde\"&gt;Tilde&lt;/a&gt;s denote &lt;a href=\"nasalized%20vowel\"&gt;nasalized vowel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Underline\"&gt;underlining&lt;/a&gt; denotes &lt;a href=\"Breathy%20voice\"&gt;murmured&lt;/a&gt; vowels.\n&lt;a href=\"Vowel\"&gt;Vowel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"consonant\"&gt;consonant&lt;/a&gt;s are outlined in the tables below. Hovering the mouse cursor over them will reveal the appropriate &lt;a href=\"International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet\"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt; symbol. Finally, there are three Wikipedia-specific additions: \"f\" is used interchangeably with \"ph\", representing the widespread realization of as ; \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00f4\" for novel characters \u0a8d and \u0a91 ; \"\u01ce\" for 's where &lt;a href=\"elision\"&gt;elision&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain. See &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20phonology\"&gt;Gujarati phonology&lt;/a&gt; for further clarification.\nUnicode.\nGujarati script was added to the &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\nThe Unicode block for Gujarati is U+0A80\u2013U+0AFF:\nFurther details regarding how to use Unicode for creating Gujarati script can be found on Wikibooks: .\nISCII.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Script%20Code%20for%20Information%20Interchange\"&gt;Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&lt;/a&gt; (ISCII) code-page identifier for Gujarati script is 57010."
