He undertook officer training in England, followed by a stint at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich\"&gt;Royal Artillery Cadet School&lt;/a&gt; before his promotion to 2nd Lieutenant (and later acting Lieutenant). He then served on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; with the South African Heavy Artillery where he was wounded in the left leg in April 1918. He relinquished his commission on 1 June 1919.\nAfter the War he played for &lt;a href=\"Blackheath%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackheath&lt;/a&gt; and was elected a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20F.C.\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; in the 1919\u201320 season.
