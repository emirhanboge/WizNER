Baird signed a professional contract with Clyde in July 2003, but only made one more appearance for the club, in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before he was released from his contract along with seven other youth players in December 2003.\nHe was then snatched up by &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, where he became a fringe player. He had loan spells at &lt;a href=\"Stenhousemuir%20F.C.\"&gt;Stenhousemuir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, before signing for Montrose on a permanent transfer in July 2007. Upon the move, Manager &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Weir\"&gt;Jim Weir&lt;/a&gt; made expectations for Baird and &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Rodgers\"&gt;Andy Rodgers&lt;/a&gt; to become the top scorer in the Third Division.\nAfter finishing the season as the league's top goal scorer, and being nominated for Third Division player of the year, Baird was a much sought after player with First and Second Division teams looking at him. However it was announced through the local press that John Baird had signed a new, lucrative contract with Montrose for at least one more year. He has stated his desire to see Montrose promoted and also his eventual aim to get himself back to playing full-time football.\nAirdrie United, Raith Rovers and Dundee.\nManager Weir was axed after a 2\u20131 defeat away at &lt;a href=\"Cowdenbeath%20F.C.\"&gt;Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt; in September. The move saw Calum Smith go in the other direction. Baird waited until deadline day in January 2009 to make his decision to join &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.\"&gt;Airdrie United&lt;/a&gt;, Baird enjoyed a successful second half of the 2008\u201309 season where he established himself as a first-team player with the new Diamonds. Baird scored crucial goals in the play-off including a hat-trick against Ayr Utd battle to keep the club in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 26 May 2010, he signed for &lt;a href=\"Raith%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Raith Rovers&lt;/a&gt; on a two-year full-time deal. Since his arrival at Starks Park, Baird has become a fans' favourite, scoring 13 league goals in his first season with the Kirkcaldy outfit during their 2010\u201311 title push. However, Raith Rovers' title push came to an end after losing 2\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dunfermline Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Baird was named the First Division Player of the Year and also was named player of the year in the Irn Bru Phenomenal awards.\nBaird signed for &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt; in May 2012. While at Dundee, Baird appeared in the first team, making 37 appearances, though his playing time significantly decreased. It wasn't until 19 January 2013 that he scored his first goal in a 1\u20131 draw against &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to score three goals in three consecutive games against &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;.\nPartick Thistle, Raith return.\nHe then signed for newly promoted side &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt; in May 2013. However, on 28 January 2014, Baird was released by Partick Thistle after an unsuccessful time having started four games and making a further 13 substitute appearances without scoring a single competitive goal.\nOn 30 January 2014, Baird returned for a second spell at &lt;a href=\"Raith%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Raith Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. Baird's first game after signing for the club in his second spell came on 1 February 2014 when Raith Rovers lost 1\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Cowdenbeath%20F.C.\"&gt;Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt; and then scored his first goal two weeks later, in a 4\u20132 loss against &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Academical%20F.C.\"&gt;Hamilton Academical&lt;/a&gt;. He scored the winner for Raith in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in extra time at &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Road\"&gt;Easter Road&lt;/a&gt; on 6 April 2014.\nQueen of the South and Falkirk.\nOn 20 May 2014, Baird signed for &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt; on a two-year contract. Baird was released by the club on 5 January 2015.\nOn 7 January 2015, Baird signed for Falkirk, where he joined up with &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Kerr%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Mark Kerr&lt;/a&gt;, who had also recently departed the &lt;a href=\"Dumfries\"&gt;Dumfries&lt;/a&gt; club. On signing for the club, he commented that he had always admired Falkirk, saying \"Falkirk is a club I've always respected and when I walked in the door Alex Smith told me I'd been nipping his ear for four years to get here.\" He scored on his debut for the club, a 3\u20133 draw away to &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; on 10 January 2015. On 24 February 2015, Baird signed a new contract with Falkirk, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2015\u201316 season with the option of an additional year.\nInverness.\nBaird signed for &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt; in June 2017. He Scored his first goal &amp; his first hat-trick for ICT in a 4\u20131 friendly away win at &lt;a href=\"Brora%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Brora Rangers&lt;/a&gt;\nHe made his first competitive start for ICT in their first game of the season, the opening game of the Scottish League Cup group stages, a 3\u20130 home win against &lt;a href=\"Brechin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Brechin City&lt;/a&gt; He retained his starting place for the following match, a 0\u20130 draw away at &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling Albion&lt;/a&gt;, a match which set a record as the lowest scoring penalty shootout in Scottish football history. Baird was one of those who failed to score as Inverness won the shootout 2\u20130. He scored his first competitive goal for the Caley Jags a week later in a 2\u20131 away win at &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, although it wasn't enough for the club to progress from their League Cup group.\nGreenock Morton (loan).\n&lt;a href=\"Greenock%20Morton%20F.C.\"&gt;Greenock Morton&lt;/a&gt; announced on 22 February that they had agreed to sign Baird on an emergency loan from &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;2017\u201318&lt;/a&gt; season.\nForfar Athletic.\nBaird signed for &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt; as a player/assistant manager on 3 May 2018. Baird scored 22 goals in 44 appearances for the club, before leaving at the end of the season to move to Australia.\nRaith return.\nIn September 2019, Baird re-signed for Raith Rovers, joining the club for a third spell, claiming to have \"unfinished business\" at the club. However, he left with his family to Australia in June 2020, unfortunately without finishing the business he desired, due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; postponing all footballing tournaments including a &lt;a href=\"2020%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, which would've pitted him up against a former club, &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonours.\nClub.\nRaith Rovers"
