    "text": "Beef noodle soup is a &lt;a href=\"noodle%20soup\"&gt;noodle soup&lt;/a&gt; made of &lt;a href=\"stewed\"&gt;stewed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Braising\"&gt;braised&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;, beef &lt;a href=\"broth\"&gt;broth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Noodle\"&gt;noodles&lt;/a&gt;. It exists in various forms throughout &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;. \nOne of the oldest beef noodle soups is the Lanzhou lamian (\u5170\u5dde\u62c9\u9762) or Lanzhou beef noodle soup which was created by the &lt;a href=\"Hui%20people\"&gt;Hui people&lt;/a&gt; of northwest China during the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. There are numerous beef noodle soups available in China with a higher variety in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20China\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt; than the east.\nThere is a red-braised beef noodle soup (\u7d05\u71d2\u725b\u8089\u9eb5) from Taiwan, which was first created by &lt;a href=\"Sichuanese%20people\"&gt;Sichuanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; veterans; it is commonly known as Taiwanese beef noodle soup in English.\nVariations.\nLanzhou beef noodle soup.\nThe Lanzhou beef noodle soup is a Chinese Muslim style of beef noodle, also known as clear-broth or consomm\u00e9-stewed beef noodle (). It often uses &lt;a href=\"halal\"&gt;halal&lt;/a&gt; (or \"qingzhen\") meat and contains no &lt;a href=\"soy%20sauce\"&gt;soy sauce&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a lighter taste that may be flavoured by salt and herbs. Local lore attributes its creation with a Hui Chinese man from Lanzhou named Ma Baozi. In &lt;a href=\"Lanzhou\"&gt;Lanzhou&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href=\"Gansu\"&gt;Gansu&lt;/a&gt;, Lanzhou Beef Lamian () is usually served with clear soup and one hand-pulled &lt;a href=\"lamian\"&gt;lamian&lt;/a&gt; noodle per bowl. In halal restaurants, only quality local beef from the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Yellow%20cattle\"&gt;Southern Yellow cattle&lt;/a&gt; () prepared by the local halal butcher is used for the beef noodle. Chinese radish and the specially cooked spicy oil are also indispensable partners to Lanzhou beef noodles. These ingredients are known as \"One Clear, Two White, Three Red, Four Green, Five Yellow\" (), referring to clear soup, white radish, red chili oil, green leek and yellow noodles respectively. In overseas Chinese communities in North America, this food can be found in Chinese restaurants. In &lt;a href=\"Mainland%20China\"&gt;Mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole &lt;a href=\"meal\"&gt;meal&lt;/a&gt; with or without any side dish. \nTaiwanese beef noodle soup.\nTaiwanese beef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish originating from Taiwan. It is sometimes referred to as \"Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup\" (\u56db\u5ddd\u725b\u8089\u9eb5), especially in Taiwan . Although this usage can create confusion as &lt;a href=\"Sichuan\"&gt;Sichuan&lt;/a&gt; has its own versions of beef noodle soups which may be sold at Sichuanese restaurants under the same name. The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the stock simmer for long periods with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. In &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with &lt;a href=\"suan%20cai\"&gt;suan cai&lt;/a&gt; (Chinese sauerkraut) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.\nOther Southeast Asian Varieties.\nIn Thailand, kuaitiao nuea pueay is a similar dish of braised beef served with rice noodles.\nIn Vietnam, B\u00f2 Kho is a beef stew sometimes served with noodles (or bread as an alternative). &lt;a href=\"Pho\"&gt;Pho&lt;/a&gt; is also a Vietnamese noodle soup that contains broth, rice noodles called b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf, herbs and meat, primarily made with either beef (ph\u1edf b\u00f2) or chicken (ph\u1edf g\u00e0). In Philippines, \"Beef Mami\" is very popular and can also be combined with \"Pares\".\n&lt;a href=\"Yaka%20mein\"&gt;Yaka mein&lt;/a&gt; is a type of beef noodle soup commonly found in Chinese restaurants in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of stewed beef, spaghetti noodles, hard-boiled egg and chopped green onions, with &lt;a href=\"Cajun\"&gt;Cajun&lt;/a&gt; seasoning, chili powder or &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bay\"&gt;Old Bay-brand seasoning&lt;/a&gt;."
