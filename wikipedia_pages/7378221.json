    "text": "The East Surrey Regiment was a &lt;a href=\"line%20infantry\"&gt;line infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; in existence from 1881 until 1959. The regiment was formed in 1881 under the &lt;a href=\"Childers%20Reforms\"&gt;Childers Reforms&lt;/a&gt; by the amalgamation of the &lt;a href=\"31st%20%28Huntingdonshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"70th%20%28Surrey%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Royal%20Surrey%20Militia\"&gt;1st Royal Surrey Militia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Royal%20Surrey%20Militia\"&gt;3rd Royal Surrey Militia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1959, after service in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the East Surrey Regiment was amalgamated with the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Regiment%20%28West%20Surrey%29\"&gt;Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, which was, in 1966, merged with the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Own%20Buffs%2C%20The%20Royal%20Kent%20Regiment\"&gt;Queen's Own Buffs, The Royal Kent Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sussex%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal Sussex Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20Regiment\"&gt;Middlesex Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (Duke of Cambridge's Own) to form the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Regiment\"&gt;Queen's Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. The Queen's Regiment was subsequently amalgamated with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Hampshire%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal Hampshire Regiment&lt;/a&gt; to form the present &lt;a href=\"Princess%20of%20Wales%27s%20Royal%20Regiment\"&gt;Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (Queen's and Royal Hampshires).\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1702 a regiment of &lt;a href=\"marines\"&gt;marines&lt;/a&gt; was raised in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Country\"&gt;West Country&lt;/a&gt; by George Villier (not related to the Villiers that became the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Buckingham\"&gt;Duke of Buckingham&lt;/a&gt;). It was named Villier's Marines. Villier was drowned in 1703, and the regiment was taken over by Alexander Luttrell. After Luttrell's death in 1705, the command went to Joshua Churchill until 1711 when it became Goring's Regiment (at this time regiments took the name of their &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 1715 the regiment was removed from the marines and became the 31st Regiment of Infantry, and in 1751 the designation was changed to the 31st Regiment of Foot. Five years later a second battalion was raised in Scotland, the 2/31st Foot, which was re-designated in 1758, the 70th Regiment of Foot (Glasgow Lowland Regiment).\nFurther changes were made in 1782. The 31st became known as the &lt;a href=\"31st%20%28Huntingdonshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot&lt;/a&gt;, while the 70th became the &lt;a href=\"70th%20%28Surrey%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot\"&gt;70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot&lt;/a&gt;. They stayed with these titles until 1881 when they became the 1st &amp; 2nd battalions of the East Surrey Regiment.\n1881 to 1914.\nFollowing amalgamation, &lt;a href=\"The%20Barracks%2C%20Kingston%20upon%20Thames\"&gt;The Barracks, Kingston upon Thames&lt;/a&gt; became the regimental depot.\nThe 1st Battalion, on formation, was in England, moving to &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in 1884. It remained in India until 1903, its last posting being at &lt;a href=\"Lucknow\"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt;. It was then recalled to England and was posted at &lt;a href=\"Aldershot\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in 1905 and to &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; in 1909.\nThe 2nd Battalion was in India when formed, moving to &lt;a href=\"Suez\"&gt;Suez&lt;/a&gt; in 1884. It then joined the &lt;a href=\"Suakin%20Expedition\"&gt;Suakin Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; in February 1885, where it saw fighting against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Mahdist%20State\"&gt;Mahdist State&lt;/a&gt;. The battalion left Suakin when the expedition was withdrawn in May 1885, returning to England. The battalion's next overseas service was in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Anglo-Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, where it took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Colenso\"&gt;Battle of Colenso&lt;/a&gt; in December 1899, the &lt;a href=\"Relief%20of%20Ladysmith\"&gt;Relief of Ladysmith&lt;/a&gt; in February 1900, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Tugela%20Heights\"&gt;Battle of the Tugela Heights&lt;/a&gt; in February 1900. After &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; the battalion was shipped to India in 1903, where it replaced the 1st battalion at Lucknow. The battalion remained in India until the outbreak of the First World War.\nThe 3rd (Militia) Battalion, which was formed from the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Royal%20Surrey%20Militia\"&gt;1st Royal Surrey Militia&lt;/a&gt; in 1881, was a reserve battalion. It was embodied for service during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa on 3 May 1900, disembodied on 15 October 1900, re-embodied on 6 May 1901 and disembodied on 26 July 1902. More than 600 officers and men returned to Southampton by the SS \"Gaika\" in July 1902, following the end of the war, and was disbanded at Kingston barracks after having received their service medals.\nThe 4th (Militia) Battalion, formed from the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Royal%20Surrey%20Militia\"&gt;3rd Royal Surrey Militia&lt;/a&gt; in 1881 was also a reserve battalion. It was embodied for service on 4 December 1899, disembodied on 12 July 1901, and re-embodied again for service during Second Boer War in South Africa. Eight hundred and fifty officers and men returned to Southampton by the SS \"Tagus\" in October 1902, following the end of the war, and was disbanded at the Kingston barracks.\nUnder the 1881 reforms the regiment was also assigned four Volunteer Battalions:\nThe &lt;a href=\"1st%20Surrey%20Rifles\"&gt;1st Surrey Rifles&lt;/a&gt; was based at &lt;a href=\"Camberwell\"&gt;Camberwell&lt;/a&gt;; it did not change its title when affiliated to the East Surreys, and in 1908 it became the 21st (County of London) Battalion in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Regiment%20%281908%E2%80%931938%29\"&gt;London Regiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 3rd Surrey Rifle Volunteers at &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%2C%20London\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; became the 2nd Volunteer Battalion and adopted that as its title in 1887.\nThe 5th Surrey Rifle Volunteers at Kingston became the 3rd Volunteer Battalion and was also redesignated in 1887.\nThe 7th Surrey Rifle Volunteers at &lt;a href=\"Southwark\"&gt;Southwark&lt;/a&gt; became the 4th Volunteer Battalion at &lt;a href=\"Clapham%20Junction\"&gt;Clapham Junction&lt;/a&gt;, it later became &lt;a href=\"23rd%20%28County%20of%20London%29%20Battalion\"&gt;23rd (County of London) Battalion&lt;/a&gt; in the London Regiment.\nIn 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt; and the latter the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Reserve\"&gt;Special Reserve&lt;/a&gt;; the regiment now had two Special Reserve and two Territorial battalions: the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20%28Reserve%29%20Battalion%2C%20East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;3rd (Reserve) Battalion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"4th%20%28Extra%20Reserve%29%20Battalion%2C%20East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, both at Kingston Barracks, with the 5th Battalion (TF) at St George's Road in Wimbledon (since demolished) and the 6th Battalion (TF) at Orchard Road in Kingston upon Thames (since demolished).\nFirst World War.\nRegular Army.\nOn 4 August 1914, the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment was in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven days later, mobilization completed and at full war establishment, the 1st Battalion landed at &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; in France, and before the end of the month was in action against the Germans. The battalion was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"14th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;14th Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;5th Division&lt;/a&gt;, part of the original &lt;a href=\"British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;British Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; (BEF). During the &lt;a href=\"Retreat%20from%20Mons\"&gt;Retreat from Mons&lt;/a&gt; and afterwards, the battalion took part in the great battles of 1914, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Le%20Cateau\"&gt;Le Cateau&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne\"&gt;Marne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne\"&gt;Aisne&lt;/a&gt;. In 1915, after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20La%20Bass%C3%A9e\"&gt;Battle of La Bass\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, the 1st East Surreys withstood a most determined attack on &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hill%2060%20%28Western%20Front%29\"&gt;Hill 60&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt;. In the desperate fighting which ensued, the battalion won three Victoria Crosses and seven Distinguished Conduct Medals. Among the VCs was &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Roupell\"&gt;George Roupell&lt;/a&gt;, who later became the last Colonel of the East Surrey Regiment. On 30 December 1915, the 14th Brigade was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"32nd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;32nd Division&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before the 1st Battalion was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"95th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;95th Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;5th Division&lt;/a&gt;, on 12 January 1916. In 1916, the 1st Battalion took part in the great battles of the &lt;a href=\"Somme%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Somme&lt;/a&gt;, and distinguished itself notably at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Morval\"&gt;Morval&lt;/a&gt; in September. The battalion took part in many of the great battles of 1917, such as &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29\"&gt;Arras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Battle%20of%20Ypres\"&gt;Third Battle of Ypres&lt;/a&gt;. After a four-month tour on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian Front&lt;/a&gt;, the battalion was back in France in March 1918, and was engaged in the Battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Albert%20%281918%29\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Bapaume\"&gt;Bapaume&lt;/a&gt;, and the subsequent advance to victory.\nThe 2nd Battalion returned from &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; at the outbreak of war, but it was not until January 1915 that it arrived in France with the &lt;a href=\"85th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;85th Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"28th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;28th Division&lt;/a&gt;. It was soon in action to the south of Ypres where it lost many men, some by poison gas: the battalion lost some 800 troops out of about 1,000. The 2nd Battalion took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Loos\"&gt;Battle of Loos&lt;/a&gt; in September 1915, and fought valiantly in the defence of the &lt;a href=\"Hohenzollern%20Redoubt\"&gt;Hohenzollern Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. At a vital stage in this battle, Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Fleming-Sandes\"&gt;Arthur Fleming-Sandes&lt;/a&gt;, though wounded, displayed exceptional courage and leadership, for which he was later awarded the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt;. The following month the battalion was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Salonika Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;, and spent the remainder of the War on the &lt;a href=\"Struma%20%28river%29\"&gt;Struma Valley&lt;/a&gt; Front and east of &lt;a href=\"Doiran%20Lake\"&gt;Lake Doiran&lt;/a&gt;. The battalion saw action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281918%29\"&gt;Battle of Doiran&lt;/a&gt; in January 1918.\nSpecial Reserve.\nThe 3rd (Reserve) and 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalions remained in England with the dual role of home defence and of training and preparing reinforcement drafts of reservists, special reservists, recruits and returning wounded for the regular battalions.\nTerritorial Force.\nThe 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions, East Surrey Regiment were not to see service on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. Both battalions were part of the &lt;a href=\"131st%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Surrey Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the 4th and 5th &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Regiment%20%28West%20Surrey%29\"&gt;West Surreys&lt;/a&gt;, and attached to the &lt;a href=\"44th%20%28Home%20Counties%29%20Division\"&gt;Home Counties Division&lt;/a&gt;. They embarked for India in October 1914 and were employed on garrison duties in the United Provinces and the Punjab for two years. The 1/5th Battalion then joined the &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamian%20campaign\"&gt;Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; in December 1917 and took part in the operations on the Tigris, while the 1/6th Battalion left India in February 1917 for a twelve-month tour of duty with the Aden Field Force.\nHostilities-only battalions.\nAfter the outbreak of war the East surreys formed nine 'New Army' or '&lt;a href=\"Kitchener%27s%20Army\"&gt;Kitchener's Army&lt;/a&gt;' battalions:\nThe 7th (Service) Battalion landed at &lt;a href=\"Boulogne-sur-Mer\"&gt;Boulogne-sur-Mer&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"37th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;37th Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division\"&gt;12th (Eastern) Division&lt;/a&gt; in June 1915 for service on the Western Front. The battalion fought at the battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Loos\"&gt;Loos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;the Somme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Albert%20%281916%29\"&gt;Albert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29\"&gt;Arras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the &lt;a href=\"55th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;55th Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"18th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division\"&gt;18th (Eastern) Division&lt;/a&gt; in July 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The battalion fought at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Loos\"&gt;Battle of Loos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;. One particular incident will always be remembered. On the &lt;a href=\"First%20day%20on%20the%20Somme\"&gt;first day of the Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;, 1 July 1916, B Company of the 8th Battalion went into the attack dribbling two footballs which the company commander, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Nevill\"&gt;Wilfred Nevill&lt;/a&gt;, had bought for his platoons to kick across &lt;a href=\"no%20man%27s%20land\"&gt;no man's land&lt;/a&gt;. Captain Nevill and many of his men were killed during the advance, but the 8th East Surreys were one of the few battalions to reach and hold their objective on this day. The \"Football Attack\" caught the imagination of the country, and illustrations of it are shown in the Regimental Museum, which also contains one of the footballs used. On that day, the 8th Battalion won two &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Order\"&gt;DSO&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal\"&gt;DCM&lt;/a&gt;s and nine &lt;a href=\"Military%20Medal\"&gt;MM&lt;/a&gt;s, but 446 officers and men were killed or wounded.\nThe 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the &lt;a href=\"72nd%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;72nd Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"24th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;24th Division&lt;/a&gt; in September 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The battalion saw action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"10th%20%28Reserve%29%20Battalion%2C%20East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;10th&lt;/a&gt; and 11th Battalions were formed as service battalions but converted to reserve battalions, training and preparing reinforcement drafts for the battalions overseas.\nWhen the regimental depots were overwhelmed by volunteers, so-called '&lt;a href=\"Pals%20battalions\"&gt;Pals battalions&lt;/a&gt;' were formed by mayors and corporations up and down the country; the East Surreys were assigned two of these:\nThe 12th (Service) Battalion (Bermondsey) landed at Le Havre as part of the &lt;a href=\"122nd%20Brigade\"&gt;122nd Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"41st%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;41st Division&lt;/a&gt; in May 1916 also for service on the Western Front. The battalion saw action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Messines&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Battle%20of%20Ypres\"&gt;Third Battle of Ypres&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"13th%20%28Service%29%20Battalion%20%28Wandsworth%29%2C%20East%20Surrey%20Regiment\"&gt;13th (Service) Battalion (Wandsworth)&lt;/a&gt; landed at Le Havre as part of the &lt;a href=\"120th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;120th Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"40th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;40th Division&lt;/a&gt; in June 1916 also for service on the Western Front. The battalion saw action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Cambrai&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Arras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 14th (Reserve) Battalion was formed at Wimbledon in 1915 to supply reinforcements to the 12th and 13th battalions.\nA short-lived 15th (Service) Battalion was formed in 1918, and was used to reconstitute the shattered 13th (Wandsworth) Battalion.\n1919 to 1939.\nBetween August and October 1919 the First Battalion were in the &lt;a href=\"Murmansk\"&gt;Murmansk&lt;/a&gt; area of North Russia to help cover the evacuation of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Russia%20intervention%23Withdrawal%20of%20British%20troops\"&gt;expedition sent to support the White Russian forces&lt;/a&gt; against the Bolsheviks. On their return, they served in Ireland in 1920 during the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;troubles&lt;/a&gt;. They were then abroad for the next 18 years, serving in Egypt, Hong Kong, the Sudan and India. Returning to the Sudan in 1938, forty members of the battalion were employed as extras in the filming of &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Feathers%20%281939%20film%29\"&gt;\"The Four Feathers\"&lt;/a&gt;, set during the &lt;a href=\"reconquest%20of%20the%20Sudan\"&gt;reconquest of the Sudan&lt;/a&gt; in 1898. The 1st Battalion returned to England in February 1939.\nIn 1920, the 2nd Battalion served in Egypt and Turkey, then Ireland, returning to England in 1921. Apart from a posting at Gibraltar, the 2nd Battalion remained at home until September 1938, when they moved to Shanghai.\nThe service and Territorial battalions were disbanded after the First World War but in 1920 the 5th and 6th Battalions of the East Surreys were re-formed. In 1938 the 5th Battalion was converted to an Anti-Tank Regiment to form the 57th (East Surrey) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA), with headquarters at Wimbledon. In 1939 a duplicate unit was formed as the 67th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA), with headquarters at Sutton.\nThe 6th Battalion comprised five &lt;a href=\"Company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; based at &lt;a href=\"drill%20hall\"&gt;drill hall&lt;/a&gt;s with A Company at &lt;a href=\"Chertsey\"&gt;Chertsey&lt;/a&gt;, B and C at Park Road, &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20London\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, D at Orchard Road, &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Thames\"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; and HQ at &lt;a href=\"Surbiton\"&gt;Surbiton&lt;/a&gt;. By the summer of 1939 the 6th battalion, commanded by Lt Col M.D.Hicks since 1936, numbered over 1,200.\nSecond World War.\nThe 1st Battalion.\nThe 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment was a &lt;a href=\"Standing%20army\"&gt;Regular Army&lt;/a&gt; unit based in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in September 1939. The battalion was part of the &lt;a href=\"11th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20and%20Headquarters%20South%20East\"&gt;11th Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which also included the 2nd Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20Fusiliers\"&gt;Lancashire Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt; and 1st Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire%20and%20Buckinghamshire%20Light%20Infantry\"&gt;Ox and Bucks Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt;, and was attached to the &lt;a href=\"4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;4th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; and was sent to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;British Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; (BEF) in October. After returning to the United Kingdom after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dunkirk\"&gt;Battle of Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunkirk%20evacuation\"&gt;evacuation from Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt; in May\u2013June 1940 the 1st Battalion was reformed and spent the next two years on home defence expecting a &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Sea%20Lion\"&gt;German invasion&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1942 the battalion was reassigned, with the rest of the 11th Brigade, part of the newly raised &lt;a href=\"78th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;78th \"Battleaxe\" Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;, with which it remained for the rest of the war. It took part in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Torch\"&gt;Operation Torch&lt;/a&gt; in November 1942, landing in North Africa at &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British First Army&lt;/a&gt;. Following this the battalion fought with the division in &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20Campaign\"&gt;Tunisian Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in May 1943. During this time it took part in notable actions such as &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Ochsenkopf\"&gt;Ochsenkopf offensive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Longstop%20Hill\"&gt;Longstop Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tebourba\"&gt;Tebourba&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter North Africa the British First Army was disbanded and 78th Division became part of the &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British Eighth Army&lt;/a&gt;. The battalion then fought in &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; before moving to Italy for the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Italian campaign&lt;/a&gt; where it had notable involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Volturno%20Line\"&gt;Battle of Termoli&lt;/a&gt; and the fighting on the &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Line\"&gt;Barbara Line&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernhardt%20Line%238th%20Army%20advance%20from%20the%20Sangro\"&gt;River Sangro&lt;/a&gt; during the autumn of 1943. In February 1944 78th Division was switched to the &lt;a href=\"Cassino\"&gt;Cassino&lt;/a&gt; sector. The battalion initially held positions on the River Rapido south of Cassino but by March had been moved into bleak and exposed positions in the mountains north of the town. In late April they were relieved and after a brief rest took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino%23Fourth%20battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino\"&gt;fourth and final battle of Monte Cassino&lt;/a&gt; in May 1944. They were then involved in the pursuit after the Allied breakthrough. They fought a hard engagement at Lake Trasimeno on the &lt;a href=\"Trasimene%20Line\"&gt;Trasimene Line&lt;/a&gt; in June 1944 before being withdrawn with the rest of the division in July to Egypt for rest and training.\nThe 1st East Surreys returned with 78th Division to Italy in September 1944 in time to take part in \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Olive\"&gt;Operation Olive&lt;/a&gt;\" and the fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Apennine%20Mountains\"&gt;Apennine Mountains&lt;/a&gt; during the winter of 1944 and occupying positions on Monte Spaduro when the front became static. In February 1945 the battalion came out of the front line to prepare and train for the offensive planned for the spring. By late March the whole division was in place on the banks of the Senio river ready for the start of the &lt;a href=\"Spring%201945%20offensive%20in%20Italy\"&gt;spring 1945 offensive&lt;/a&gt; which started on 6 April. The battalion fought in the intense action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Argenta%20Gap\"&gt;Argenta Gap&lt;/a&gt; before advancing with the rest of the division to the north of the Gulf of Venice and crossing the Italian border to finish the war in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2nd Battalion.\nIn September 1938 the 2nd Battalion was moved from Colchester to the British Concession of the International Settlement in Shanghai. In August 1940 the battalion was posted from &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"British%20Malaya\"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt; where it was attached to &lt;a href=\"11th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29\"&gt;11th Indian Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; based in North West Malaya. In December 1941 the &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese Army &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20campaign\"&gt;invaded Malaya&lt;/a&gt; after landing in southern &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. The 2nd East Surreys suffered tremendous casualties during the defence and retreat from this part of Malaya. The battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment (in 1946 re-titled &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Leicestershire%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal Leicestershire Regiment&lt;/a&gt;) to form the &lt;a href=\"British%20Battalion%20%28Malaya%201941%29\"&gt;British Battalion&lt;/a&gt; (Malaya 1941) on 19 December 1941. This unit fought gallantly throughout the rest of the short campaign until the surrender of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in February 1942.\nIn May 1942 the 2nd Battalion was reformed in the United Kingdom from the re-designation of the 11th Battalion, a hostilities-only battalion raised in 1940 that joined the &lt;a href=\"184th%20%282nd%20South%20Midland%29%20Brigade\"&gt;184th Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"61st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;61st Division&lt;/a&gt;. It did not see further action in World War II.\nTerritorial Battalions.\nThe 6th Battalion, East Surrey Regiment was a &lt;a href=\"Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Territorial Army&lt;/a&gt; (TA) unit until 1939, when each unit was ordered to form a 2nd Line duplicate. It was therefore split in two with Kingston and Hersham companies and the Band used to form the 1/6th and the Chertsey and Richmond companies and the Drums to form the 2/6th. Both were embodied on 24 August 1939 whilst at camp in &lt;a href=\"Lympne\"&gt;Lympne&lt;/a&gt; and were fully mobilised and guarding vulnerable points at the outbreak of war on 3 September.\nA further five other, hostilities-only, territorial battalions were formed in 1940: the 8th, 9th, 10th, the 50th (Holding) and the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalions. An army camp was established in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Park\"&gt;Richmond Park&lt;/a&gt; to add capacity to the Regimental Depot at Kingston in its role as an Infantry Training Centre. It operated there from early 1940 until August 1941 when the ITC transferred to &lt;a href=\"Canterbury\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, a facility shared with &lt;a href=\"Buffs%20%28Royal%20East%20Kent%20Regiment%29\"&gt;the Buffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1/6th was initially commanded by Lt Col Hicks until he transferred out in December 1939 to be replaced by Lt Col F O Voisin. A draft transferred in from the 1st Battalion whilst soldiers under 20 years of age were transferred out to the 2/6th. After a period of intense training at &lt;a href=\"Lyme%20Regis\"&gt;Lyme Regis&lt;/a&gt; the battalion of 28 officers and 643 other ranks embarked for France from Southampton on 5 April 1940 arriving at Cherbourg.\nThe 1/6th were deployed with the &lt;a href=\"132nd%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;132nd Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"44th%20%28Home%20Counties%29%20Division\"&gt;44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;British Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; (BEF). They billeted at &lt;a href=\"Conlie\"&gt;Conlie&lt;/a&gt; then travelled by road, train and a long march to &lt;a href=\"Bailleul%2C%20Nord\"&gt;Bailleul&lt;/a&gt; on the Belgian border. During the journey, Voisin was posted elsewhere and command was transferred to Lt Col, later Brigadier, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Armstrong%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;C D Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, formerly with the 1st Battalion.\nThe battalion was exchanged in 132nd Brigade for the 1st Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Own%20Royal%20West%20Kent%20Regiment\"&gt;Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, making that brigade an all-West Kent formation, and the 1/6th transferred to the &lt;a href=\"10th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;10th Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;4th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;, as part of official BEF policy to integrate the Regular and Territorial Armies.\nBy 15 May the battalion were moved to positions on the &lt;a href=\"Dyle%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Dyle&lt;/a&gt;, coming under attack from the air on the way as they reached the &lt;a href=\"River%20Senne\"&gt;River Senne&lt;/a&gt; to the north-east of Brussels. When it became clear the line would not hold, 10 Brigade were ordered to withdraw behind the &lt;a href=\"River%20Dendre\"&gt;River Dendre&lt;/a&gt;. By 19 May they were in position at &lt;a href=\"Avelghem\"&gt;Avelghem&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Escaut\"&gt;River Escaut&lt;/a&gt; defending and eventually overseeing the destruction of the bridge at Rugge and subsequently conducting patrols in the area until withdrawn, on 19 May, just north of the town. On 21 May they relieved 2 DCLI and continued excursions at Rugge suffering many casualties and some fatalities. Ordered to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"Neuville-en-Ferrain\"&gt;Neuville-en-Ferrain&lt;/a&gt;, they marched overnight, re-entering France at &lt;a href=\"Mouscron\"&gt;Mouscron&lt;/a&gt;, taking up positions near the border early on 23 May.\nThree days of fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Risquons-Tout\"&gt;Risquons-Tout&lt;/a&gt; area followed with the 1/6 suffering five of the fifteen related fatalities and many casualties. Ordered to withdraw on 27 May, they marched and re-captured the village of &lt;a href=\"Voormezele\"&gt;Voormezele&lt;/a&gt; with further casualties. The following evening they marched overnight towards Dunkirk. After resting at &lt;a href=\"Poperinge\"&gt;Poperinghe&lt;/a&gt; they were transported to &lt;a href=\"Veurne\"&gt;Furnes&lt;/a&gt; where they were quickly deployed to help defend the canal to the east of &lt;a href=\"Nieuwpoort%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Nieuport&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting over the next few days was fierce with the battalion also coming under fire from aircraft and an &lt;a href=\"observation%20balloon\"&gt;observation balloon&lt;/a&gt;. On 31 May they were joined by the 1st Battalion and fought side by side into the night when 1/6 were ordered to withdraw. They reached the beach at &lt;a href=\"De%20Panne\"&gt;La Panne&lt;/a&gt; but on learning that no further boats would be landing there moved into Dunkirk. Despite coming under fire again they mostly managed to remain together and were amongst the last to be evacuated.\nArmstrong remained in command until April 1942 when he was posted to command the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion. Lt Col H.A.B. Bruno took command in April 1942 and led the battalion in action in North Africa in March, but was killed in action during the attack on &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Longstop%20Hill\"&gt;Djebel Djaffa&lt;/a&gt; in April. He was succeeded by Lt Col R O V Thompson, who had served with the 1st and 2nd Battalions before the war, appointed from a posting in the RAF to command the 1/6th for the final phase of the Tunisian Campaign. He subsequently led the battalion into action in Italy in the crossing of the &lt;a href=\"Rapido%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Rapido&lt;/a&gt; and the capture of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino\"&gt;Cassino&lt;/a&gt;. He, too was killed in action when his Jeep was blown up by a mine near &lt;a href=\"Tivoli%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Tivoli&lt;/a&gt; on 7 June 1944. Colonel C G S McAlester took command until February 1945. For the final months of the war, until August 1945, the battalion was led by Lt Col A G H Culverhouse, who had previously served with the 1/6th and had been wounded at Dunkirk.\nThe 2/6th Battalion was formed in 1939 under the command of Lt. Col. H.S. Burgess.\nThe battalion was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"37th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;37th Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the 6th and &lt;a href=\"5th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Sussex%20Regiment\"&gt;7th&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sussex%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal Sussex&lt;/a&gt;, part of &lt;a href=\"12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;12th (Eastern) Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;. All soldiers under 20 years of age in 37 Brigade were assigned to a composite company based at 'Courtlands', &lt;a href=\"West%20Worthing\"&gt;West Worthing&lt;/a&gt; where they were engaged in coastal defence. The rest of the battalion were deployed as part of the BEF and a force of 23 officers and 603 other ranks sailed from Southampton, arriving in and stationed at &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; from 22 April 1940. Initially intended as a &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20communication\"&gt;line of communication&lt;/a&gt;s unit and expected to undertake further training they almost immediately became involved in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20France\"&gt;Battle of France&lt;/a&gt; and the defence of the Channel ports. On 15 May they were reassigned as motorised infantry, incorporated into &lt;a href=\"Beauman%20Division\"&gt;Beauforce&lt;/a&gt; and sent north to join the rest of the BEF. With their route blocked by the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Abbeville\"&gt;Battle of Abbeville&lt;/a&gt;, they were ordered to take up a defensive position west of the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9thune%20%28river%29\"&gt;River B\u00e9thune&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Saint-Aubin-le-Cauf\"&gt;Saint-Aubin-le-Cauf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arques-la-Bataille\"&gt;Arques-la-Bataille&lt;/a&gt; and undertake patrols as part of the support group for the &lt;a href=\"1st%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%20Division\"&gt;1st Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt;. Here they were rejoined by D Company from detachment at &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9camp\"&gt;F\u00e9camp&lt;/a&gt; and remained until relieved by a battalion of &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Foresters\"&gt;Sherwood Foresters&lt;/a&gt;. After a few days' rest at &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;, where Major D G Adams assumed command on 3 June, they were assigned to provide flank and rear-guard cover for the &lt;a href=\"51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division\"&gt;51st (Highland) Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; and ordered to hold a line east of the &lt;a href=\"Bresle%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Bresle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Forges-les-Eaux\"&gt;Forges-les-Eaux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aumale\"&gt;Aumale&lt;/a&gt;, relieving the &lt;a href=\"Border%20Regiment%23Territorial%20Army\"&gt;4th Borders&lt;/a&gt; protecting &lt;a href=\"anti-tank%20gun\"&gt;anti-tank gun&lt;/a&gt;s of the 1st Armoured Division. Lightly armed and spread very thinly, they were over-run in places by the rapidly advancing &lt;a href=\"7th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;7th Panzer Division&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ref name=\"War Diary 2/6ESR\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 8 June they were ordered to withdraw north to the &lt;a href=\"Eu%20Forest\"&gt;Eu Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They then proceeded via the &lt;a href=\"Eawy%20Forest\"&gt;Eawy Forest&lt;/a&gt;, skirting &lt;a href=\"Bellencombre\"&gt;Bellencombre&lt;/a&gt; which had fallen, reaching &lt;a href=\"Beauval-en-Caux\"&gt;Beaunay&lt;/a&gt; on 10 June, &lt;a href=\"Cailleville\"&gt;Cailleville&lt;/a&gt; on 11th and into &lt;a href=\"Saint-Valery-en-Caux\"&gt;Saint-Valery-en-Caux&lt;/a&gt; joining with the 51st Highland Division defences and anticipated &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Cycle\"&gt;Operation Cycle&lt;/a&gt; evacuation. Finally, surrounded and unable to escape, the &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29%23United%20Kingdom\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; and supporting troops were forced to surrender to &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Rommel\"&gt;Rommel&lt;/a&gt; on 12 June 1940. Fifteen officers and 251 other ranks of the 2/6th were taken &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt; including commanding officer Major D G Adams. About 120 of the 2/6th were able to escape via the evacuations from nearby &lt;a href=\"Veules-les-Roses\"&gt;Veules-les-Roses&lt;/a&gt; and a small number, separated from the main battalion, escaped to the west via &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Nazaire\"&gt;Saint Nazaire&lt;/a&gt; and other ports. The captured troops were force-marched through France and Belgium to the Rhine in Holland, then taken by barge and rail to imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stalag%20XX-A\"&gt;Stalag XX-A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stalag%20XX-B\"&gt;XX-B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stalag%20XXI-D\"&gt;XX1-D&lt;/a&gt;. After St. Valery, the remainder of the battalion reassembled at &lt;a href=\"Haltwhistle\"&gt;Haltwhistle&lt;/a&gt;, Northumberland, where they were re-joined by the young contingent from 'Courtlands'. The battalion was reformed under Norman Brading at &lt;a href=\"Swaffham\"&gt;Swaffham&lt;/a&gt;, Norfolk, but did not see further active service, spending the remainder of the war principally as a defence and training battalion. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Battle of Britain&lt;/a&gt; they were deployed to home defence duties including airfield defence in Norfolk and, after winter in &lt;a href=\"Bedford\"&gt;Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, coastal defence at &lt;a href=\"Kessingland\"&gt;Kessingland&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"11th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;11th Division&lt;/a&gt;. Winter 1941 was spent at &lt;a href=\"Henley-on-Thames\"&gt;Henley-on-Thames&lt;/a&gt; after which they returned to Norfolk, this time at &lt;a href=\"Thetford\"&gt;Thetford&lt;/a&gt; in June 1942. They moved to &lt;a href=\"Durham%2C%20England\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; in August, remaining there for seven months during which time Brading accepted a posting to be replaced briefly by W. M. Knatchbull until succeeded by D.C. Campbell-Miles MBE in September. In March 1943 they moved to &lt;a href=\"Malton%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Malton, North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=\"Uckfield\"&gt;Uckfield&lt;/a&gt; from 4 July where P.H. Macklin took command. In early October they returned to Norfolk, this time to &lt;a href=\"Hunstanton\"&gt;Hunstanton&lt;/a&gt; where they participated in \"Exercise Sugar Beet\", helping with the &lt;a href=\"sugar%20beet\"&gt;sugar beet&lt;/a&gt; harvest. In January 1944 they moved back to Durham for three weeks and then to &lt;a href=\"Felton%2C%20Northumberland\"&gt;Felton, Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; where it became clear that the battalion would not see action in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Overlord\"&gt;Invasion of France&lt;/a&gt; as 270 men were transferred out to units of 21 Army Group in April. Instead the battalion was sent to &lt;a href=\"Hornsey\"&gt;East Hornsey&lt;/a&gt; to organise and man a marshalling sub-area until July. It then moved to &lt;a href=\"Lowestoft\"&gt;Lowestoft&lt;/a&gt; under command of D.C. Coates and was dedicated as a training battalion, taking drafts of new recruits, putting them through basic training prior to being sent to Europe as reinforcements. Still in this role, the battalion moved again to &lt;a href=\"Shorncliffe%20Army%20Camp\"&gt;Shorncliffe&lt;/a&gt; at the end of September 1944 and &lt;a href=\"Whittlesford\"&gt;Whittlesford&lt;/a&gt; 15 November 1944. J.G.M.G Gough took command in January 1945 and was succeeded by R.W.M. Wetherell in September 1945. The battalion was placed in '&lt;a href=\"suspended%20animation\"&gt;suspended animation&lt;/a&gt;' on 28 July 1946.\nHostilities-only battalions.\nUnlike the first World War, the hostilities-only battalions raised during World War II were all territorials and deployed on home defence duties.\nThe 8th Battalion was raised at &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Rochester, Kent&lt;/a&gt; in March 1940 and, after moving to nearby &lt;a href=\"Aylesford\"&gt;Aylesford&lt;/a&gt; in August, transferred its young soldiers out to form the 70th in October 1940. On 27 August the following year the 8th merged with and was absorbed by the similarly affected 8th &lt;a href=\"Royal%20West%20Kent%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal West Kent Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and ceased to exist as a separate entity. The 70th, comprising six companies, spent the winter of 1940\u201341 on airfield guard duties based at &lt;a href=\"Gravesend\"&gt;Gravesend&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Capel%2C%20Surrey\"&gt;Capel Beare Green&lt;/a&gt; the following summer and &lt;a href=\"Byfleet\"&gt;Byfleet&lt;/a&gt; from October 1941 to July 1942. They then went to a camp at &lt;a href=\"Charlton%2C%20London\"&gt;Charlton&lt;/a&gt; but the battalion, along with sixteen other Young Soldiers Battalions, was disbanded by the end of August 1942.\nThe 9th Battalion was formed at &lt;a href=\"Romford\"&gt;Romford&lt;/a&gt; in May 1940 guarding vulnerable points until July when, as part of \"&lt;a href=\"Brocforce\"&gt;Brocforce&lt;/a&gt;\", it guarded a stretch of coast at &lt;a href=\"Climping\"&gt;Climping&lt;/a&gt; until October. It was then sent to Northern Ireland, initially guarding the naval base at &lt;a href=\"Derry\"&gt;Derry&lt;/a&gt; and new bomber airfield at &lt;a href=\"Limavady\"&gt;Limavady&lt;/a&gt;.

In a few days it moved to a camp at &lt;a href=\"Ilfracombe\"&gt;Ilfracombe&lt;/a&gt; where its numbers were increased by about 800 new recruits all immediately engaged on guard duties. The 10th remained in Devon, in and around Plymouth until moving to &lt;a href=\"Helston\"&gt;Helston&lt;/a&gt;, Cornwall, in June 1941 and &lt;a href=\"Tiverton%2C%20Devon\"&gt;Tiverton, Devon&lt;/a&gt; in July.
