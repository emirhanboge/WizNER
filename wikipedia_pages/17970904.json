    "text": "Lebanese people in the United Kingdom include people originating from &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; who have migrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and their descendants.\nHistory and settlement.\nAlthough there has been sporadic migration from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; to Britain since the 17th century, the real growth of the UK Lebanese population began in 1975, with the start of the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon which drove thousands of people away. The exodus was aggravated in 1982 with the &lt;a href=\"1982%20Lebanon%20War\"&gt;Israeli invasion&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, many Lebanese expatriates who were based in &lt;a href=\"West%20Africa\"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, in particular &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, left for Britain as subsequent military governments took control in those areas.\nDemographics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2001%20UK%20Census\"&gt;2001 UK Census&lt;/a&gt; recorded 10,459 Lebanese-born people. The 2011 census recorded 15,341 people born in Lebanon residing in England, 228 in Wales, 314 in Scotland and 52 in Northern Ireland.\n&lt;a href=\"Edgware%20Road\"&gt;Edgware Road&lt;/a&gt; in London is one of a number of areas that the Lebanese community has settled in and has shops selling Arabic newspapers, books and music. Other areas with Lebanese communities in London include &lt;a href=\"Bayswater\"&gt;Bayswater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kensington\"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westbourne%20Grove\"&gt;Westbourne Grove&lt;/a&gt;."
