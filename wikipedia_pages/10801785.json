    "text": "Steven John Fromholz (June 8, 1945 \u2013 January 19, 2014) was an American entertainer, singer-songwriter who was selected as the &lt;a href=\"Poet%20Laureate%20of%20Texas\"&gt;Poet Laureate of Texas&lt;/a&gt; for 2007.\nBiography.\nSteven Fromholz was born in &lt;a href=\"Temple%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Temple, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, United States, and graduated from high school in Denton, Texas in 1963. That same year, he began at &lt;a href=\"North%20Texas%20State%20College\"&gt;North Texas State College&lt;/a&gt; where he was president of the &lt;a href=\"Folk%20Music%20Club%20%28North%20Texas%29\"&gt;Folk Music Club&lt;/a&gt;. He served in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; in California from 1963 to 1968 and began performing during this time. After leaving the Navy, he teamed with &lt;a href=\"Dan%20McCrimmon\"&gt;Dan McCrimmon&lt;/a&gt; to create the group &lt;a href=\"Frummox\"&gt;Frummox&lt;/a&gt;. Fromholz also played with &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Stills\"&gt;Stephen Stills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Roberts%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Rick Roberts&lt;/a&gt; before going solo. &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Nelson\"&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt; recorded Fromholz's \"I'd Have to be Crazy\" (it reached number 11 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart and Fromholz sang harmony) and &lt;a href=\"Lyle%20Lovett\"&gt;Lyle Lovett&lt;/a&gt; covered \"Texas Trilogy\" and \"Bears.\" Other artists who have recorded his songs include &lt;a href=\"Hoyt%20Axton\"&gt;Hoyt Axton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Denver\"&gt;John Denver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Jeff%20Walker\"&gt;Jerry Jeff Walker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sturgill%20Simpson\"&gt;Sturgill Simpson&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to singing and songwriting, Fromholz dabbled in acting, playwriting, poetry, record producing, narrating, &lt;a href=\"jingle\"&gt;jingle&lt;/a&gt;-writing and &lt;a href=\"whitewater\"&gt;whitewater&lt;/a&gt; river guiding. In 2007, he was named &lt;a href=\"Poet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Texas\"&gt;Poet Laureate of the State of Texas&lt;/a&gt; by the Texas State Legislature. His latest book is \"Steven Fromholz: New and Selected Works\".\nHe had two daughters; Darcie (to whom the song \"Dear Darcie\" is dedicated) and Felicity (for whom his record label Felicity Records is named). His life and works are the subject of an Austin Sayre documentary film currently in production entitled \"The Man with the Big Hat.\"\n\" Here to There\".\nFromholz's first album, \"Here to There\", has become a difficult-to-find Texas classic, as it has long been out of print.\nIt was recorded with music partner Dan McCrimmon as the duo \"Frummox\" in 1969 on ABC Probe Records, CPLP 4511. This album is a seminal work, pre-dating and foreshadowing the Texas Music scene-to-come, when Willie Nelson relocated from Nashville to Austin and became the icon of \"Outlaw\" music. This album has never been officially released on CD. Notable on the album is his \"Texas Trilogy,\" a set of three songs meant to be played as one long work: \"Daybreak,\" \"Trainride,\" and \"Bosque County Romance,\" portraying life in rural Texas in the 1950s, set in the town of &lt;a href=\"Kopperl%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Kopperl&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Bosque%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Bosque County, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrack list (time):\nTexas Trilogy.\nFromholz's \"Texas Trilogy\" was the basis of a book by Craig D. Hillis and Bruce F. Jordan, \"Texas Trilogy: Life in a Small Texas Town\", in which the authors accompanied and illustrated the trilogy's lyrics, set in the town of Kopperl, Texas, with photographs of the surrounding landscape. It also contains interviews with principal characters within the town. The book was praised for its photographs, though not for its text.\nIn addition, Fromholz himself published a book called \"Texas Trilogy\".\nSteven Fromholz- \"A Buffalo Singing the Dinosaur Blues\"as covered by Jerry Jeff Walker- \"Hill Country Rain\"\nMe and my friends are getting long in the tooth\nAfter three or four decades of seeking the truth\nTrying to recover from misspent youth\nAnd gradually giving in to knowledge\nI know a picker who moved to Nepal\nAnd another buddy's got a little shop in a mall\nSome of my brothers ain't breathing at all\nAnd others have given up privilege\nBut I'm still beating on my old guitar\nSinging my songs in a smoky old bar\nHitching my wagon to a shooting star\nAnd hoping that star don't fall\nI'll keep picking as long as I can\nBut I don't want to die just a honky-tonk man\nI'm just a buffalo singing the dinosaur blues\nI was out last night, just me and a partner\nAin't nothing but a fool would drink that hard\nYou wind up sleeping in your buddy's front yard\nAnd you wonder what to tell the little woman\nMe and the band's up all night long\nWe was passing the pipe and banging the gong\nTrying to remember one of Van Zandt's songs\nSomething about Mudd and Gold a-gamblin'\nBut I'm still walking down the lost highway\nDoing what it takes to make my way\nKnowing that I got a piper to pay\nAnd hoping that I like the song\nMaybe it'll be a ditty I know\nI got people to see and places to go\nJust an old buffalo singing the dinosaur blues\nI've been a lucky man all of my life\nI got two great kids and a wonderful wife\nGot a rosewood guitar and a very sharp knife\nAnd I got a handy little knack for rhymin'\nI been blessed with a voice that can sing\nAnd a faith in the future and what it may bring\nAnd change is the very most natural of things\nAnd life is mostly attitude and timing\nOne of these days, well, I'll disappear\nYou'll look around and I won't be here\nDon't worry, buddy, there's nothing to fear\nI'm just going where the rivers flow\nYou can find me in a rubbery boat\nDown in Mexico you can send me a note\nCare of a old buffalo singing the dinosaur\nI've played Buffalo, I recall Dinah Shore\nI'm just a buffalo singing the dinosaur blues\nDeath.\nIn the early afternoon of January 19, 2014 Fromholz was fatally injured when a rifle fell from its case and discharged. He died en route to the hospital. The accident occurred as Fromholz was making preparations to hunt feral hogs who were killing the baby goats on a ranch near his residence outside &lt;a href=\"Eldorado%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Eldorado, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. He is buried in the nearby Fort McKavett Cemetery."
