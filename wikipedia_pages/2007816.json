Each year, over 3,000 candidates will sit the entrance examination for a total of approximately 960 places (across all four schools).\nOverview.\nIn 2001, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sun-Herald\"&gt;The Sun-Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School sixth in Australia's top ten girls' schools, based on the number of its &lt;a href=\"Alumnus\"&gt;alumnae&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the \"&lt;a href=\"Who%27s%20Who%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Who's Who in Australia&lt;/a&gt;\". The Mac.Robertson Girls' High School has a long tradition of academic excellence with &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Certificate%20of%20Education\"&gt;Victorian Certificate of Education&lt;/a&gt; (VCE) scores propelling the school to be ranked first in the State of Victoria for seven consecutive years from 2002 to 2008, inclusive. The school was ranked third in 2009, but reclaimed its No. 1 ranking once again in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2018. Mac.Robertson Girls' High School was ranked second out of all state secondary schools in Victoria based on VCE results in 2018.\nHistory.\nThe Mac.Robertson Girls' High School began as &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Continuation%20School\"&gt;Melbourne Continuation School&lt;/a&gt;, the first government funded school in the state of Victoria, established in 1905 in &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Street%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Spring Street&lt;/a&gt;, Melbourne. In 1912, it was renamed Melbourne High School. Originally a co-educational school, the school was segregated by sexes in 1927, with the boys moving to Melbourne Boys' High School in Forrest Hill, &lt;a href=\"South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;South Yarra, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.It is known to be for smart children that actually have a chance passing a very difficult test.\nGirls continued to be educated in the school on Spring Street, renamed as Melbourne Girls' High School, until the building was condemned in 1930. The school was housed in the then-vacant Government House until 1933, when they moved to State School No. 1689 in King Street. In 1934, with the help of a donation from &lt;a href=\"Macpherson%20Robertson\"&gt;Macpherson Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, a new building was constructed the north-east corner of &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Park%20and%20Lake\"&gt;Albert Park Reserve&lt;/a&gt;. The school opened as the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School on 7 November 1934. The school was used as U.S Army Headquarters in 1942 and later by the R.A.A.F. The students took their classes at Brighton Road State School, Camberwell East Girls' School, and University High School during this period.\n&lt;a href=\"MacRobertson%20Girls%27%20High%20School%20buildings\"&gt;The building&lt;/a&gt; gained a national trust classification in 1987. It was previously gazetted as an Historic Building in 1982. The school celebrated its centenary year in 2005 with Melbourne High School in a joined assembly. Mac.Rob celebrated by inviting Premier of Victoria &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bracks\"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt; to witness the restarting of the school clock tower (which coincidentally would not start when the time came).\nEnrolment and structure.\nThe school operates in a two sub-school structure. The middle school caters for students in years 9 and 10, whilst the senior school caters for students in years 11 and 12. The school's enrolment across all four-year levels totals to approximately 950 to 980 students every year. The number of students taught at the school has increased over the last few years. In and prior to 2018, 225 students were admitted into year 9, with an extra class of 25 added in year 10. In 2019, the number of students in year 9 was changed to 250, with only a small number of students added in year 10 to bring the cohort back to 250 students after some left. In 2020, a quota of 300 year 9 students were selected for enrolment every year through the year 8 entrance examination. The size of the year 10-12 cohorts vary slightly each year, totalling between 230 and 260 students each year, including the intake of few students into Year 11. \nSubjects.\nIn Year Nine, students are offered two electives per semester, with core subjects Maths, English, Science, Physical Education, School Singing compulsory for the entire year.
