The legislature is elected for a term of five years, unless it is dissolved early. By convention elections to the provincial legislature are held at the same time as elections to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The legislature meets in the &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Johannesburg City Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most recent elections were held &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20general%20election%2C%202019\"&gt;on 8 May 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and were won by the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC) which obtained 37 of the 73 seats on the legislature. The composition of the legislature is as follows:\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Party !! style=\"text-align:center\"| Seats \nExecutive.\nThe head of the provincial executive is the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Gauteng\"&gt;Premier of Gauteng&lt;/a&gt;, who is a member of the provincial legislature elected by the legislature. The Premier appoints an &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Executive Council&lt;/a&gt; who are a &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; overseeing the executive &lt;a href=\"government%20department\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt;.\n the Premier is &lt;a href=\"David%20Makhura\"&gt;David Makhura&lt;/a&gt; of the ANC, and the ten members of the Executive Council are described in the following table.\nCourts.\nSouth Africa has a single national court system and the provinces do not have their own courts. The &lt;a href=\"Gauteng%20Division\"&gt;Gauteng Division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;High Court of South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, which has seats in &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, has jurisdiction over all cases arising in the province. However, most cases are first heard in one of the over 25 district &lt;a href=\"magistrate%27s%20court%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;magistrates' courts&lt;/a&gt; or in the regional magistrate's court for the province. Appeals from the magistrates' courts are to the High Court, and appeals from the High Court are to the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Supreme Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministrative divisions.\nGauteng is divided into three &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;metropolitan municipalities&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"district%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;district municipalities&lt;/a&gt;. The district municipalities are in turn divided into a total of seven &lt;a href=\"local%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;local municipalities&lt;/a&gt;. These municipalities are:"
