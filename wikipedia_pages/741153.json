    "text": "Flight 15P of &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Composites%20SpaceShipOne\"&gt;SpaceShipOne&lt;/a&gt; (X0) was the first privately funded &lt;a href=\"human%20spaceflight\"&gt;human spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;. It took place on June 21, 2004. It was the fourth powered test flight of the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Composites%20Tier%20One\"&gt;Tier One&lt;/a&gt; program, the previous three test flights having reached much lower altitudes. The flight carried only its &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20%28spaceflight%29\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Melvill\"&gt;Mike Melvill&lt;/a&gt;, who thus became the first non-governmental &lt;a href=\"astronaut\"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis flight was a full-altitude test, but not itself a competitive flight for the &lt;a href=\"Ansari%20X%20Prize\"&gt;Ansari X Prize&lt;/a&gt;, the prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft. Problems were encountered during the flight, but later corrected, paving the way for SpaceShipOne to make competitive flights later in 2004.\nFlight profile.\nAll times are in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Daylight%20Time\"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt;, which is seven hours behind &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. This was the local civil time at the spaceport on the day of the flight. All measurements are first stated in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20customary%20units\"&gt;U.S. customary units&lt;/a&gt; in which they were originally reported, with conversions to &lt;a href=\"SI\"&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt; units also given.\nTaxiing for takeoff from &lt;a href=\"Mojave%20Airport%20%26amp%3B%20Spaceport\"&gt;Mojave Spaceport&lt;/a&gt; was originally planned for 06:30, because the wind conditions in that area are most favorable in the early morning. Taxiing actually started at 06:37, and the flight took off at 06:47. After an ascent to 47,000 feet (14.3\u00a0km) coupled with the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Composites%20White%20Knight\"&gt;White Knight&lt;/a&gt; airplane, the SpaceShipOne craft separated at 07:50 and immediately ignited its &lt;a href=\"rocket\"&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after ignition, at about 60,000 feet (18\u00a0km), the craft unexpectedly &lt;a href=\"flight%20dynamics\"&gt;rolled&lt;/a&gt; 90 degrees to the left, due to wind shear. When the pilot attempted to correct it, it rolled 90 degrees to the right. The pilot levelled the craft out, and proceeded with the climb. The correction of the roll excursion, using full trim, caused a pitch trim tab to run up against a stop. This caused the trim actuator, as designed, to stop operating for a 3 s timeout. Not realising what had happened, the pilot and controllers interpreted this as failure of the trim actuator, and they switched to a backup system. Spacecraft &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20attitude\"&gt;attitude&lt;/a&gt; was problematic during the entire climb, and not corrected until the start of re-entry.\nDuring the burn, a new aerodynamic fairing installed around the rocket nozzle overheated, became too soft, and crumpled inwards. This caused a loud bang, which the pilot reported, but did not cause a flight problem.\nThe rocket burn lasted for 76 seconds. At burn-out the altitude was 180,000 feet (54.9\u00a0km), the &lt;a href=\"Mach%20number\"&gt;Mach number&lt;/a&gt; was 2.9, and the speed was 2150\u00a0mph (3460\u00a0km/h; 961 &lt;a href=\"Metre%20per%20second\"&gt;m/s&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe planned &lt;a href=\"apogee\"&gt;apogee&lt;/a&gt; altitude was 360,000 feet (110\u00a0km), but due to the attitude problem encountered during the climb the craft actually attained only 328,491 feet (100,124 m). In doing so it passed the &lt;a href=\"boundary%20to%20space\"&gt;boundary to space&lt;/a&gt; at 100\u00a0km, making the flight, as planned, officially a &lt;a href=\"spaceflight\"&gt;spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;. It can be calculated that the altitude exceeded 100\u00a0km for approximately 10.23 s.\nAround apogee the craft experienced about 3 minutes of &lt;a href=\"weightlessness\"&gt;weightlessness&lt;/a&gt;. Pilot Mike Melvill opened a bag of &lt;a href=\"M%26amp%3BM%27s\"&gt;M&amp;M's&lt;/a&gt; and watched them float around the capsule in free fall.\nThe craft re-entered the atmosphere 22 miles (35\u00a0km) &lt;a href=\"south\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; of its planned 5 by 5 mile (8 by 8\u00a0km) re-entry zone. The pilot finally corrected the spacecraft attitude at this point, using a backup trim system. The craft reached Mach 2.9 and experienced deceleration of 5.0 &lt;a href=\"g-force\"&gt;\"g\"&lt;/a&gt; (49\u00a0m/s\u00b2) during descent. The craft switched to gliding configuration at an altitude of 57,000 feet (17.4\u00a0km), then returned to the spaceport and landed safely at 08:14.\nSpectacle.\n&lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Composites\"&gt;Scaled Composites&lt;/a&gt;, the makers of SpaceShipOne, announced the planned spaceflight on June 2, 2004, and invited the public to watch. An estimated 11,000 people went to Mojave Spaceport to watch the flight, and millions more watched on television. Distinguished attendees included former astronaut &lt;a href=\"Buzz%20Aldrin\"&gt;Buzz Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Commanding%20officer\"&gt;Commanding Officer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Edwards Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause SpaceShipOne launches to the &lt;a href=\"east\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mojave%20Airport%20%26amp%3B%20Spaceport\"&gt;Mojave Spaceport&lt;/a&gt; early in the morning, the crowd at the spaceport found themselves looking into the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; when watching the aircraft. Nevertheless, the crowd was exuberant, cheering every milestone in the flight, including the double sonic boom following the thrust phase. After SpaceShipOne landed, White Knight and the chase planes made celebratory passes over the runway. Mike Melvill displayed great excitement, waving to the crowd while standing on top of SpaceShipOne. He also held up a sign reading \"SpaceShipOne, GovernmentZero,\" given to him by a spectator - an apparent reference to the then-ongoing suspension of Space Shuttle flight operations following the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster\"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia\"&gt;Space Shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"STS-107\"&gt;STS-107&lt;/a&gt;. Melvill was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Buzz%20Aldrin\"&gt;Buzz Aldrin&lt;/a&gt;, the second person to have walked on the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nReactions.\n&lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; administrator &lt;a href=\"Sean%20O%27Keefe\"&gt;Sean O'Keefe&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement about the flight, saying:\nThe &lt;a href=\"X%20Prize%20Foundation\"&gt;X Prize Foundation&lt;/a&gt; issued a press release about the flight:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; presented Melvill with &lt;a href=\"Astronaut%20Badge\"&gt;astronaut wings&lt;/a&gt; in a ceremony at 10:22, two hours after landing.\nRelation to the Ansari X Prize.\nAs intended, the flight exceeded the 100\u00a0km threshold required for the X PRIZE. However, the flight was not intended as an X PRIZE competitive flight, and was not registered as such.\nThe flight did not carry any passengers, or equivalent ballast, as required for an X PRIZE flight, and so could not qualify as a competitive flight. Furthermore, the X PRIZE rules require a repeat flight within two weeks, which the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Composites\"&gt;Scaled Composites&lt;/a&gt; team had no intention of making.\nFlight 15P was intended to be the final test flight before making the two X PRIZE flights later in 2004. Due to the problems encountered on this flight it was thought that an additional test flight might be needed. However, by July 7, 2004 &lt;a href=\"Burt%20Rutan\"&gt;Burt Rutan&lt;/a&gt; reported that the faults had been resolved and the &lt;a href=\"SpaceShipOne%20flight%2016P\"&gt;next flights&lt;/a&gt; would be competitive."
