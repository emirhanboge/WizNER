    "text": "Jaya Jaya Myra is a published author and speaker on natural health, wellness, spirituality and mind body wellbeing. Her work emphasizes integrative mind-body approaches to wellness, stress reduction, and overall life balance, which help people stay well mentally, emotionally and physically. She is based in New York City.\nBackground.\nJaya Jaya Myra became physically incapacitated by a clinically-diagnosed case of fibromyalgia while working as a research scientist and pursuing a PhD in cell and molecular biology; she was subsequently released from her employment on disability. After running through a course of conventional medical treatment with no change in her condition, she turned to complementary and alternative \"healing modalities\" which included meditation, mindfulness practices, and other aspects of Eastern philosophy. Using these approaches, she claims to have completely regained her health, which led her to advocate and teach techniques for natural health and wellness.\nJaya Jaya Myra's approach shows the interconnections between purpose, spirituality and health, which she gave a TEDx talk on in November 2018. She created The WELL Method as a framework for these teachings to teach people the 4 cornerstones to a purpose-filled, healthy life. The WELL Method and more on the connection of purpose, spirituality and health are the subject of her upcoming book with Post Hill Press, The Soul of Purpose.\nMedia appearances.\nJaya Jaya Myra has appeared on numerous TV programs, including the nationally broadcast daytime show Harry, NBC's CT Live! CBS as well as many radio programs and podcasts.\nShe has been quoted in numerous publications, including &lt;a href=\"Parents%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Parents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Today%20%28American%20TV%20program%29\"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reader%27s%20Digest\"&gt;Reader's Digest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redbook\"&gt;Redbook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Better%20Homes%20and%20Gardens%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Better Homes &amp; Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Brides, &lt;a href=\"Bustle%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Bustle&lt;/a&gt;, Ecosalon, and others.\nShe has bylines in &lt;a href=\"The%20Epoch%20Times\"&gt;The Epoch Times&lt;/a&gt;, Tathaastu, Yoga Magazine, and Naturally Savvy.\nSpeaking engagements.\nShe has been a panelist for the United Nations' NGO Committee on Spirituality, Values and Global Concerns (CSVGC-NY).
