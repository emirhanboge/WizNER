    "text": "The Montefiore Club was a private social and business association, catering to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20people\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; community, located in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1880, the club was originally called the \"Montefiore Social and Dramatic Club\", named for &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Montefiore\"&gt;Sir Moses Haim Montefiore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;-Jewish &lt;a href=\"philanthropist\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt;. It was established by 11 people, all quite young, with ages ranging from 15 to 23, as a social club for young Jewish people. It held &lt;a href=\"fundraising\"&gt;fundraising&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ball%20%28dance%29\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;s to help Jewish &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Play%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;s that were produced to fund welfare programs for &lt;a href=\"immigrant\"&gt;immigrant&lt;/a&gt;s. Later renamed the \"Montefoire Club\", and modelled on &lt;a href=\"upper%20class\"&gt;upper class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gentlemen%27s%20club\"&gt;gentlemen's club&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, it functioned as a private social and business association, catering to members of the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20people\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; community.\nAmong its members, were \"well-to-do\" members of the Jewish community, who were excluded from &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"English%20Canadian\"&gt;Anglophone&lt;/a&gt; clubs such as the St. James and the Mount Royal.\nIn the early 1990s, the club had more than 600 paying members. In the mid-1990s, $500,000 was spent on renovations to the building.\nIn 2005, after experiencing a decline in membership, new policies were introduced:\nIn its final years, the building was used frequently by &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University%20%28Quebec%29\"&gt;Concordia University&lt;/a&gt;, usually for social events. In the summer of 2010, after experiencing years of financial difficulties, the club closed.\nThe club.\nTo obtain membership, a contribution to the life of Montreal's Jewish community was prerequisite.\nThe location of the Montefoire Club itself changed locations three times, the last being its 1195 &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Street\"&gt;Guy Street&lt;/a&gt; address, where it remained for 104 years, until its closure. The Guy Street location displayed no sign, with only a green canopy identifying it. The building is a large, three-storey &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; greystone.\nThe Guy Street location had a luxurious interior, with high ceilings, and a lobby built with large &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; beams in a &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch style&lt;/a&gt;. The rooms were carpeted, with deep-cusioned chairs and sofas, and walls of fine carved wood. Card rooms were located on the second floor, with bedrooms on the third floor that were made available on a temporary basis for members. Wives and children were forbidden access to the second and third floors.\nThe club was open seven days a week, and often rented out its facilities for community events. The cuisine was considered among the finest in the city, and although having a Jewish clientele, the club was never &lt;a href=\"kosher\"&gt;kosher&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable meetings.\nThroughout its history, the club was as a venue for many notable meetings involving prominent members of the Jewish community.\nClosure.\nIn the summer of 2010, after operating for 130 years, and with only 72 paying members, the club closed. It had been experiencing financial difficulties, and had insufficient membership to remain open.\nAt the time of its closure, the club had used all of its financial reserves, and was operating at a deficit of approximately $25,000 per month. With an annual operating budget of about $750,000, and full fees being only about $2,000 (among the lowest for Montreal's private clubs), the club was unable to remain operation.\nThe organization sold the building to Concordia University. It will be renovated, and then used for meetings, events, and academic conferences.\nThe proceeds from the sale of the premises will be used to pay costs and staff severances. Remaining funds, expected to amount to approximately $1.5 million, will be donated to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Community%20Foundation%20of%20Montreal\"&gt;Jewish Community Foundation of Montreal&lt;/a&gt; for Jewish education, and to Concordia University to fund a Jewish studies endowment.\nThe contents of the building, which includes artwork, will be auctioned to members, with remaining items made available to the general public.\nThe club plans to donate its substantial archives to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Public%20Library%20of%20Montreal\"&gt;Jewish Public Library&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nNotable former members include:\nPresidents.\nSome past presidents include:\nLegacy.\nTo support scholarships for &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20University%20%28Quebec%29\"&gt;Concordia University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graduate%20student\"&gt;graduate student&lt;/a&gt;s, an endowment has been established. Recipients will be \"Moses Montefiore Fellows\".\nA plaque commemorating Moses Montefiore will be attached to the Guy Street building with the enscription:\n\"In memory of Sir Moses Montefiore for his lifelong philanthropy and service to world Jewry\"."
