They competed in the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;First League of Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; from 1996 to 2005. The club made its solo European appearance in the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;2004\u201305 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and went on to win the &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20Cup\"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20Cup\"&gt;same season&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounded as \u017delezni\u010dki SK on 28 May 1930, the club became more organized during the 1950s. They changed their name to FK \u017deleznik in 1961, following a merger with FK Napredak, which was originally created by the &lt;a href=\"Ivo%20Lola%20Ribar%20Institute\"&gt;Ivo Lola Ribar Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1963 and 1967, the club competed in the Serbian League North, the third tier of Yugoslav football. They lost to &lt;a href=\"FK%20Sloboda%20U%C5%BEice\"&gt;Sloboda U\u017eice&lt;/a&gt; in the promotion playoffs to the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Second%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav Second League&lt;/a&gt; in 1965.\nThe club continued to participate at regional level without notable achievements until 1993, when Jusuf \"Jusa\" Buli\u0107 acquired the club. They won the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20League%20North\"&gt;Serbian League North&lt;/a&gt; in the 1994\u201395 season and took promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20League%20of%20FR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Second League of FR Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Second%20League%20of%20FR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;1995\u201396 season&lt;/a&gt;, the club was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20FR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;First League of FR Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (I/B League). They finished second in the I/B League in the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20First%20League%20of%20FR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;1996\u201397 season&lt;/a&gt;, earning them a spot in the I/A League in the &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20First%20League%20of%20FR%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;1997\u201398 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the assassination of his father, Dragan \"Aca\" Buli\u0107 took over the club in May 1998. Led by the youngest club president in the history of FR Yugoslavia football, they continued to progress rapidly, finishing in a higher league position every season. Simultaneously, the club reached the semi-finals of the national cup in two consecutive seasons in &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20FR%20Yugoslavia%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20Cup\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, but was eliminated by &lt;a href=\"FK%20Smederevo\"&gt;Sartid Smederevo&lt;/a&gt; on both occasions.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20First%20League%20of%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;2003\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt;, the club achieved its best league performance by finishing in third place, thus securing a spot in the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;2004\u201305 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They were eliminated by Romanian club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; in the second qualifying round, losing 5\u20134 on aggregate. Despite only finishing ninth in the league &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20First%20League%20of%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;that season&lt;/a&gt;, the club made the biggest success in its history by winning the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20Cup\"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2005, due to financial difficulties, the club was forced to withdraw its participation from the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;2005\u201306 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually merged with another Belgrade-based club &lt;a href=\"FK%20Vo%C5%BEdovac\"&gt;Vo\u017edovac&lt;/a&gt;, which continued to compete in the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20SuperLiga\"&gt;2005\u201306 Serbia and Montenegro SuperLiga&lt;/a&gt;.\nRefounded as FK \u017deleznik Lavovi, the club started competing in the Belgrade Third League, the seventh tier of Serbian football.
