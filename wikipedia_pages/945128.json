    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, quartal harmony is the building of &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;harmonic&lt;/a&gt; structures built from the &lt;a href=\"Interval%20%28music%29\"&gt;intervals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20fourth\"&gt;perfect fourth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tritone\"&gt;augmented fourth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"diminished%20fourth\"&gt;diminished fourth&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a three-note quartal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fourths, C\u2013F\u2013B. \n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n \\clef treble \\time 4/4 &lt;c f bes&gt;1\n&lt;/score&gt;\nQuintal harmony is harmonic structure preferring the &lt;a href=\"perfect%20fifth\"&gt;perfect fifth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"augmented%20fifth\"&gt;augmented fifth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tritone\"&gt;diminished fifth&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a three-note quintal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fifths, C\u2013G\u2013D. \n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n \\clef treble \\time 4/4 &lt;c g' d'&gt;1\n&lt;/score&gt;\nProperties.\nUse of the terms \"quartal\" and \"quintal\" arises from a contrast, compositional or perceptual, with traditional &lt;a href=\"tertian\"&gt;tertian&lt;/a&gt; harmonic constructions. Listeners familiar with music of the European &lt;a href=\"common%20practice%20period\"&gt;common practice period&lt;/a&gt; perceive &lt;a href=\"tonality\"&gt;tonal&lt;/a&gt; music as that which uses &lt;a href=\"major%20scale\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"minor%20scale\"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chord%20%28music%29\"&gt;chords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"musical%20scale\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt;, wherein both the &lt;a href=\"major%20third\"&gt;major third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"minor%20third\"&gt;minor third&lt;/a&gt; constitute the basic \"structural elements\" of the harmony. \nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Persichetti\"&gt;Vincent Persichetti&lt;/a&gt; writes that:\n\"Quintal harmony\" (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the &lt;a href=\"Inversion%20%28interval%29\"&gt;inversion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Complement%20%28music%29\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from \"quartal harmony\". Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different &lt;a href=\"Voicing%20%28music%29\"&gt;voicings&lt;/a&gt;, some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B, can be written as\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n \\clef treble \\time 4/4 &lt;c f bes&gt;1 &lt;f bes c&gt; &lt;bes c f&gt; &lt;f bes c f&gt;\n&lt;/score&gt;\nHistory.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20music\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance. During the &lt;a href=\"common%20practice%20period\"&gt;common practice period&lt;/a&gt; (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a &lt;a href=\"Consonance%20and%20dissonance\"&gt;dissonance&lt;/a&gt; (when appearing as a &lt;a href=\"Suspension%20%28music%29\"&gt;suspension&lt;/a&gt; requiring resolution in the &lt;a href=\"voice%20leading\"&gt;voice leading&lt;/a&gt;) or as a &lt;a href=\"Consonance%20and%20dissonance\"&gt;consonance&lt;/a&gt; (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord). In the later 19th century, during the &lt;a href=\"Emancipation%20of%20the%20dissonance\"&gt;breakdown of tonality&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt;, all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed. Quartal harmony was developed in the early &lt;a href=\"20th-century%20classical%20music\"&gt;20th century&lt;/a&gt; as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\nPrecursors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20chord\"&gt;Tristan chord&lt;/a&gt; is made up of the notes F, B, D and G and is the first chord heard in &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Tristan%20und%20Isolde\"&gt;Tristan und Isolde&lt;/a&gt;\". \n \\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new Voice \\relative c\" {\n \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.-&gt;(~ gis4 a8 ais8-&gt; b4~ b8) r r\n \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\&lt; f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\&gt; d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n \u00bb\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c {\n \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red &lt;f b&gt;2.( &lt;e gis&gt;4.)~ &lt;e gis&gt;8 r r\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant. The chord had been found in earlier works, notably &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2018%20%28Beethoven%29\"&gt;Piano Sonata No. 18&lt;/a&gt;, but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional &lt;a href=\"tonal%20harmony\"&gt;tonal harmony&lt;/a&gt; and even towards &lt;a href=\"atonality\"&gt;atonality&lt;/a&gt;, and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its &lt;a href=\"Functional%20harmony\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;, a notion which was soon after to be explored by &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Debussy\"&gt;Debussy&lt;/a&gt; and others. \nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary &lt;a href=\"dominant%20seventh\"&gt;dominant seventh&lt;/a&gt; chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Scriabin\"&gt;Scriabin&lt;/a&gt; used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20chord\"&gt;Mystic chord&lt;/a&gt; (shown below) in his &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Sonata%20No.%206%20%28Scriabin%29\"&gt;Piano Sonata No. 6&lt;/a&gt;. \n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n \\clef treble \\time 4/4 &lt;c fis bes e a d&gt;1\n&lt;/score&gt;\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional &lt;a href=\"tertian\"&gt;tertian&lt;/a&gt; passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F\u2013B\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F\u2013B\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20%28Scriabin%29\"&gt;Mysterium&lt;/a&gt;\" show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20scale\"&gt;chromatic scale&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn France, &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Satie\"&gt;Erik Satie&lt;/a&gt; experimented with &lt;a href=\"Parallel%20harmony\"&gt;planing&lt;/a&gt; in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Fils%20des%20%C3%A9toiles\"&gt;Le Fils des \u00e9toiles&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dukas\"&gt;Paul Dukas&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sorcerer%27s%20Apprentice%20%28Dukas%29\"&gt;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;\" (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\".\n20th- and 21st-century classical music.\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Debussy\"&gt;Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Poulenc\"&gt;Francis Poulenc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Scriabin\"&gt;Alexander Scriabin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alban%20Berg\"&gt;Alban Berg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Bernstein\"&gt;Leonard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Schoenberg\"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Stravinsky\"&gt;Igor Stravinsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Hisaishi\"&gt;Joe Hisaishi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Webern\"&gt;Anton Webern&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchoenberg.\n&lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Schoenberg\"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20Symphony%20No.%201\"&gt;Chamber Symphony Op. 9&lt;/a&gt; (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measure and a half construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes (highlighted in red in the illustration) A\u2013D\u2013F\u2013B\u2013E\u2013A distributed over the five stringed instruments (the viola must tune down the lowest string by a minor third, and read in the unfamiliar tenor clef).\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his \"Theory of Harmony\" (\"Harmonielehre\") of 1911, he wrote:\nFor &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Webern\"&gt;Anton Webern&lt;/a&gt;, the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\"\nOthers.\nIn his \"Theory of Harmony\": \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and &lt;a href=\"Alban%20Berg\"&gt;Alban Berg&lt;/a&gt; have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k\"&gt;B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k&lt;/a&gt; or the Viennese &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schreker\"&gt;Franz Schreker&lt;/a&gt;, who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Puccini&lt;/a&gt;, are not far off.\"\nFrench composer &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Ravel\"&gt;Maurice Ravel&lt;/a&gt; used quartal chords in &lt;a href=\"Sonatine%20%28Ravel%29\"&gt;Sonatine&lt;/a&gt; (1906) and \"&lt;a href=\"Ma%20m%C3%A8re%20l%27Oye\"&gt;Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye&lt;/a&gt;\" (1910), while American &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Ives\"&gt;Charles Ives&lt;/a&gt; used quartal chords in his song \"The Cage\" (1906).\nHindemith constructed large parts of his symphonic work \"\" by means of fourth and fifth intervals. These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C\u2013D\u2013G becomes the fourth chord D\u2013G\u2013C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C in measure 3 of the example).\nHindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing \"Unterweisung im Tonsatz\" (\"The Craft of Musical Composition\",) he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\" so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"...the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\" He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its &lt;a href=\"Combination%20tone\"&gt;Combination tone&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nThe works of the Filipino composer (1915\u20131984) are characterised by quartal and quintal harmonies, as well as by dissonant counterpoint and polychords.\nAs a transition to the history of jazz, &lt;a href=\"George%20Gershwin\"&gt;George Gershwin&lt;/a&gt; may be mentioned. In the first movement of his &lt;a href=\"Concerto%20in%20F%20%28Gershwin%29\"&gt;Concerto in F&lt;/a&gt; altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\nJazz.\nThe style of jazz, having an &lt;a href=\"Eclecticism\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; harmonic orbit, was in its &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20sub-Saharan%20African%20harmony\"&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; overtaken (until perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Swing%20%28genre%29\"&gt;Swing&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music. Important influences come thereby from &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"military%20band\"&gt;military band&lt;/a&gt;s as well as from the piano music of Classical and Romantic composers, and even that of the Impressionists. Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by &lt;a href=\"pianist\"&gt;pianist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arranger\"&gt;arranger&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"Jelly%20Roll%20Morton\"&gt;Jelly Roll Morton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Ellington\"&gt;Duke Ellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Tatum\"&gt;Art Tatum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Evans\"&gt;Bill Evans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Milt%20Buckner\"&gt;Milt Buckner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chick%20Corea\"&gt;Chick Corea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herbie%20Hancock\"&gt;Herbie Hancock&lt;/a&gt;, and especially &lt;a href=\"McCoy%20Tyner\"&gt;McCoy Tyner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"hard%20bop\"&gt;hard bop&lt;/a&gt; of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz. &lt;a href=\"Quintet\"&gt;Quintet&lt;/a&gt; writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined &lt;a href=\"polyphony\"&gt;polyphony&lt;/a&gt; such as is found in &lt;a href=\"cool%20jazz\"&gt;cool jazz&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn his watershed record \"&lt;a href=\"Kind%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Kind of Blue&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Davis\"&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt; with pianist &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Evans\"&gt;Bill Evans&lt;/a&gt; used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"&lt;a href=\"So%20What%20%28composition%29\"&gt;So What&lt;/a&gt;\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a &lt;a href=\"So%20What%20chord\"&gt;So What chord&lt;/a&gt;, and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom.\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist &lt;a href=\"McCoy%20Tyner\"&gt;McCoy Tyner&lt;/a&gt;'s work with saxophonist &lt;a href=\"John%20Coltrane\"&gt;John Coltrane&lt;/a&gt;'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Nelson\"&gt;Oliver Nelson&lt;/a&gt; was also known for his use of fourth chord &lt;a href=\"voicing%20%28music%29\"&gt;voicings&lt;/a&gt;. Tom Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Parker\"&gt;Charlie Parker&lt;/a&gt;\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble.\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Smith\"&gt;Johnny Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Farlow\"&gt;Tal Farlow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Wayne\"&gt;Chuck Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barney%20Kessel\"&gt;Barney Kessel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Pass\"&gt;Joe Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Raney\"&gt;Jimmy Raney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Montgomery\"&gt;Wes Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;\u2014however, all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Hall%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Jim Hall&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Rollins\"&gt;Sonny Rollins&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge%20%28Sonny%20Rollins%20album%29\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"George%20Benson\"&gt;George Benson&lt;/a&gt; (\"Sky Dive\"), &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Martino\"&gt;Pat Martino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Wilkins\"&gt;Jack Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; (\"Windows\"), &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Diorio\"&gt;Joe Diorio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Roberts\"&gt;Howard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Burrell\"&gt;Kenny Burrell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Montgomery\"&gt;Wes Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Johnson%20%28guitarist%29\"&gt;Henry Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Malone\"&gt;Russell Malone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Bruno\"&gt;Jimmy Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Alden\"&gt;Howard Alden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bollenback\"&gt;Paul Bollenback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Whitfield\"&gt;Mark Whitfield&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rodney%20Jones%20%28guitarist%29\"&gt;Rodney Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental &lt;a href=\"Scale%20%28music%29\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz. Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called &lt;a href=\"Mode%20%28music%29\"&gt;church modes&lt;/a&gt; of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists &lt;a href=\"Herbie%20Hancock\"&gt;Herbie Hancock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chick%20Corea\"&gt;Chick Corea&lt;/a&gt; are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as &lt;a href=\"free%20jazz\"&gt;free jazz&lt;/a&gt; also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use, owing to the wandering nature of its harmony.\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called &lt;a href=\"voicing%20%28music%29\"&gt;voicing&lt;/a&gt;, and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus.\nRock music.\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Fripp\"&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guitarist\"&gt;guitarist&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"King%20Crimson\"&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;. Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in &lt;a href=\"equal%20temperament\"&gt;equal temperament&lt;/a&gt; tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars. Of course, &lt;a href=\"just%20intonation\"&gt;just intonation&lt;/a&gt;'s perfect octaves, perfect fifths, and perfect fourths are well approximated in equal temperament tuning, and perfect fifths and octaves are highly consonant intervals. Fripp builds chords using perfect fifths, fourths, and octaves in his &lt;a href=\"new%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bstandard%20tuning\"&gt;new\u00a0standard tuning&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(NST), a &lt;a href=\"regular%20tuning\"&gt;regular tuning&lt;/a&gt; having perfect fifths between its successive &lt;a href=\"open%20string%20%28music%29\"&gt;open string&lt;/a&gt;s.(!--The specific page citation is needed here; the inclusive page numbers of the interview are found in the list of References, 88\u2013103, so the publication is not unpaginated, even if the version on the weblink is.--&gt;)\nThe 1971 album \"&lt;a href=\"Tarkus\"&gt;Tarkus&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Emerson%2C%20Lake%20%26amp%3B%20Palmer\"&gt;Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&lt;/a&gt; depends on quartal harmony throughout, including an recurrent elaboration on the classical &lt;a href=\"Alberti%20bass\"&gt;Alberti bass&lt;/a&gt; pattern, in this case consisting of three broken quartal three-note chords, the first two of which are also a perfect fourth apart, and the third a semitone higher than the first. He also uses programmatic quintal harmony in several places for extended rapid obbligato passages where human fingering would be impracticable, the first on Hammond organ and the second on Modular Moog, in a similar manner to the mutation stops on pipe organs, such as the \"Twelfth\" at 2 2/3' pitch played against a 4' \"Principal\" (which plays the eighth note). In the second instance, the triad is both quartal and quintal, being 1+4+5.\n&lt;a href=\"Ray%20Manzarek\"&gt;Ray Manzarek&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doors\"&gt;The Doors&lt;/a&gt; was another keyboard player and composer who put classical and jazz elements, including quartal harmonies, into the service of rock music. The keyboard solo of \"&lt;a href=\"Riders%20on%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Riders on the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", for instance, has several passages where the melody line is doubled at an interval of a perfect fourth, and extensive use of (E dorian) minor chord voicings featuring the seven and three, spaced by that same interval, as the prominent notes.\nExamples of quartal pieces.\nFolk.\nOn her 1968 debut album \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20to%20a%20Seagull\"&gt;Song to a Seagull&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Joni%20Mitchell\"&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; used quartal and quintal harmony in \"Dawntreader\", and she used quintal harmony in the title track \"Song to a Seagull\".\nReferences.\nSources"
