    "text": "The 1993\u201394 &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; season was the 99th ever season of professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football in Britain. Sixteen teams competed from August 1993 until May 1994 for a number of titles, primarily the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20Bitter\"&gt;Stones Bitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1994 &lt;a href=\"Man%20of%20Steel%20Award\"&gt;Man of Steel Award&lt;/a&gt; for player of the season went to Warrington's &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Davies%20%28rugby%20player%20born%201962%29\"&gt;Jonathan Davies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis season saw the highest ever away victory in the league when Keighley Cougars beat Highfield 104-4 at the Rochdale Hornets ground on 23 April.\nThis was the first season since the &lt;a href=\"1905%E2%80%9306%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season\"&gt;1905\u201306&lt;/a&gt; inaugural season of the &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Lancashire%20Cup\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt;, except for the break for &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; (Lancashire Cup only), that the Lancashire Cup and Yorkshire Cup competitions had not taken place.\nChampionship.\nWigan, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Northern&lt;/a&gt; and Warrington all finished the season on top of the ladder with 46 points, but Wigan's superior points differential saw them crowned League Champions for the fifth consecutive time. This earned them the right to travel to Australia at the close of the season and contest the &lt;a href=\"1994%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;1994 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Wigan defeated the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed their position as the dominant rugby league club of the year.\nAfter finishing in second last and last place respectively, Hull Kingston Rovers and Leigh were demoted to the Second Division.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Cut\"&gt;Silk Cut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final was played between Wigan and Leeds on a Saturday afternoon, 30 April 1994 at Wembley Stadium, before a crowd of 78,348. &lt;a href=\"Bonnie%20Tyler\"&gt;Bonnie Tyler&lt;/a&gt; lead the community singing at the match. Wigan's Martin Offiah opened the scoring with a ninety-plus metre try, and went on to win the game 26\u201316."
