    "text": "Paisley and Renfrewshire South is a &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20constituencies\"&gt;constituency&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Renfrewshire\"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;. It elects one &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; at least once every five years using the &lt;a href=\"First-past-the-post%20voting\"&gt;first-past-the-post&lt;/a&gt; system of voting.\nConstituency profile and voting patterns.\nConstituency profile.\nCovering the southern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Renfrewshire\"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt; council area, the east of the constituency includes half of &lt;a href=\"Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire\"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the smaller town of &lt;a href=\"Johnstone\"&gt;Johnstone&lt;/a&gt; and the villages of &lt;a href=\"Kilbarchan\"&gt;Kilbarchan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elderslie\"&gt;Elderslie&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is contrasted with the rural south and west of the seat, containing the villages of &lt;a href=\"Lochwinnoch\"&gt;Lochwinnoch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howwood\"&gt;Howwood&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"hamlets\"&gt;hamlets&lt;/a&gt; and farms. The constituency also contains the &lt;a href=\"Gleniffer%20Braes\"&gt;Gleniffer Braes Country Park&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20Muirshiel%20Regional%20Park\"&gt;Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park&lt;/a&gt; to the west, notable for &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Semple%20Loch\"&gt;Castle Semple Loch&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoting Patterns.\nThis seat had traditionally been considered a heartland for the Labour Party, who had held constituencies containing Paisley and its surrounding towns and villages since 1945.\nFirst used in the 2005 election, this seat was won by Labour politician &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Alexander\"&gt;Douglas Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, who had been previously MP for its predecessor constituency of Paisley South since 1997. Alexander was re-elected in the 2010 election with an increased share of the vote and majority.\nThe aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum 2014 resulted in a substantial increase in support for the SNP. Subsequently, the 2015 election saw the SNP candidate Mhairi Black gain the seat on a 27% swing. Black was re-elected in the 2017 election but only held the seat marginally over Labour. However, in the 2019 election she increased her majority and won over half the vote, making it a safe seat for the SNP.\nThe seat has also seen support for other parties, with the Conservative Party rising in 2017 and 2019 to around a fifth of the vote share. There is also a Liberal Democrat vote in the seat, with the party achieving 7% at the most recent election. The constituency has also seen several minor parties and independents stand in its history, however individually none of these have won more than 2% of the vote in any election.\nBoundaries.\nThis seat was created in 2005 from the bulk of the former &lt;a href=\"Paisley%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Paisley South&lt;/a&gt; seat, with minor additions from neighbouring constituencies.\nPopulation areas in this seat include &lt;a href=\"Glenburn%2C%20Paisley\"&gt;Glenburn&lt;/a&gt;, Saucel and Hunterhill, &lt;a href=\"Johnstone\"&gt;Johnstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilbarchan\"&gt;Kilbarchan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of Parliament.\nThe constituency's first MP was &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Alexander\"&gt;Douglas Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, who had held the seat since its creation in 2005 and its predecessor &lt;a href=\"Paisley%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Paisley South&lt;/a&gt; since 1997. Alexander was the Shadow &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs\"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, and has previously held Cabinet posts such as &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport\"&gt;Transport Secretary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland\"&gt;Scottish Secretary&lt;/a&gt; (2006\u201307; joint), and &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20International%20Development\"&gt;International Development Secretary&lt;/a&gt; (2007\u201310).\nWhen SNP candidate &lt;a href=\"Mhairi%20Black\"&gt;Mhairi Black&lt;/a&gt; gained the seat in May 2015, she was 20 years and 237 days old, making her the youngest ever Member of Parliament (MP) elected to the House of Commons since at least the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Act%20of%201832\"&gt;Reform Act of 1832&lt;/a&gt;, replacing William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam; who was 20 years and 11 months old when elected in 1832. She subsequently held the seat at the &lt;a href=\"2017%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;snap 2017 general election&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2019%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2019 general election&lt;/a&gt;."
