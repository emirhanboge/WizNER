The eight-disc set compiles all of Harrison's studio albums that were originally issued on &lt;a href=\"the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Records\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; record label. The six albums are \"&lt;a href=\"Wonderwall%20Music\"&gt;Wonderwall Music&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968), \"&lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Sound\"&gt;Electronic Sound&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969), \"&lt;a href=\"All%20Things%20Must%20Pass\"&gt;All Things Must Pass&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970; spread over two CDs), \"&lt;a href=\"Living%20in%20the%20Material%20World\"&gt;Living in the Material World&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973), \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horse%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29\"&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974) and \"&lt;a href=\"Extra%20Texture%20%28Read%20All%20About%20It%29\"&gt;Extra Texture&lt;/a&gt;\" (1975).&lt;ref name=\"Grow/RSonline\"&gt;Kory Grow, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rollingstone.com/music/news/george-harrisons-first-six-studio-albums-to-get-lavish-reissues-20140902\"&gt;\"George Harrison's First Six Studio Albums to Get Lavish Reissues\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;rollingstone.com&lt;/a&gt;, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The final disc is a DVD containing a feature titled \"The Apple Years\", promotional films from some of his previous posthumous reissues, such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%20%28album%29\"&gt;The Concert for Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;\", and other video clips. The box set marks the first time that the \"Dark Horse\" and \"Extra Texture\" albums have been remastered since their 1992 CD release.\nAmong the bonus tracks spread across the set is an alternative, instrumental version of Harrison's 1968 &lt;a href=\"B-side\"&gt;B-side&lt;/a&gt; for the Beatles, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Inner%20Light%20%28song%29\"&gt;The Inner Light&lt;/a&gt;\"; a remixed version of his non-album single \"&lt;a href=\"Bangla%20Desh%20%28song%29\"&gt;Bangla Desh&lt;/a&gt;\"; and a 1992 re-recording of \"&lt;a href=\"This%20Guitar%20%28Can%27t%20Keep%20from%20Crying%29\"&gt;This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)&lt;/a&gt;\" (featuring overdubbed contributions from &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Starr\"&gt;Ringo Starr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dhani%20Harrison\"&gt;Dhani Harrison&lt;/a&gt;) that was used to promote &lt;a href=\"David%20A.%20Stewart\"&gt;Dave Stewart&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Platinum%20Weird\"&gt;Platinum Weird&lt;/a&gt; project in 2006.&lt;ref name=\"Marchese/SecondDisc\"&gt;Joe Marchese, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//theseconddisc.com/2014/09/02/give-me-love-george-harrisons-apple-years-are-collected-on-new-box-set/\"&gt;\"Give Me Love: George Harrison\u2019s 'Apple Years' Are Collected on New Box Set\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Second Disc\", 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in the package is a book containing essays by author Kevin Howlett and rare photos.\nRelease.\nFollowing an initial statement by Dhani Harrison on social media, the upcoming release of \"The Apple Years 1968\u201375\" was officially announced on 2 September 2014. Each of the six reissued albums was also made available separate from the box set. Both \"The Apple Years 1968\u201375\" and the individual reissues were released by Apple and Universal on 22 September in the United Kingdom and 23 September in the United States. The albums were also made available in &lt;a href=\"High-resolution%20audio\"&gt;high-definition digital audio&lt;/a&gt; configuration on 24 November. Overseen by Dhani, the high-definition versions were mastered in 96\u00a0kHz/24-bit digital resolution from the original master tapes, for the first time.\nThe box set was designed as a companion piece to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Horse%20Years%201976%E2%80%931992\"&gt;The Dark Horse Years 1976\u20131992&lt;/a&gt;\", the 2004-issued set covering Harrison's career on his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horse%20Records\"&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/a&gt; record label. Speaking of why his father's later-period work had been repackaged first, rather than the complete Apple output, Dhani Harrison referred to \"politics and legal things\", while likening the non-chronological approach to that of the \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" film series.\nPromotion.\nIn the US, the release was promoted via a \"George Harrison Week\" initiative on the &lt;a href=\"TBS%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;TBS&lt;/a&gt; television show \"&lt;a href=\"Conan%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Conan&lt;/a&gt;\", beginning on Monday, 22 September.&lt;ref name=\"Strecker/BB\"&gt;Erin Strecker, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.billboard.com/articles/news/6259313/paul-simon-here-comes-the-sun-conan\"&gt;\"Paul Simon Performs 'Here Comes the Sun' for George Harrison Week on 'Conan'\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;billboard.com&lt;/a&gt;, 24 September 2014 (retrieved 25 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Over separate nights that week, &lt;a href=\"Beck\"&gt;Beck&lt;/a&gt; performed the \"All Things Must Pass\" track \"&lt;a href=\"Wah-Wah%20%28song%29\"&gt;Wah-Wah&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Simon\"&gt;Paul Simon&lt;/a&gt; played Harrison's Beatles song \"&lt;a href=\"Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\",&lt;ref name=\"Kaye/CofS\"&gt;Ben Kaye, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//consequenceofsound.net/2014/09/beck-kicks-of-conans-week-long-george-harrison-tribute-with-wah-wah-watch/\"&gt;\"Beck kicks off Conan's week-long George Harrison tribute with 'Wah-Wah' \u2013 Watch\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Consequence%20of%20Sound\"&gt;Consequence of Sound&lt;/a&gt;\", 23 September 2014 (retrieved 25 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Dhani Harrison and the band Big Black Delta performed \"&lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Down\"&gt;Let It Down&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ballad%20of%20Sir%20Frankie%20Crisp%20%28Let%20It%20Roll%29\"&gt;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)&lt;/a&gt;\", both from \"All Things Must Pass\",&lt;ref name=\"Kreps/RS\"&gt;Daniel Kreps, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/watch-dhani-harrison-perform-two-of-his-fathers-songs-on-conan-20140925\"&gt;\"Watch Dhani Harrison Perform Two of His Father's Songs on 'Conan'\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;rollingstone.com&lt;/a&gt;, 25 September 2014 (retrieved 26 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norah%20Jones\"&gt;Norah Jones&lt;/a&gt; played \"&lt;a href=\"Behind%20That%20Locked%20Door\"&gt;Behind That Locked Door&lt;/a&gt;\" from the same album. Harrison's \"Wonderwall Music\" soundtrack album, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Wonderwall%20%28film%29\"&gt;1968 film&lt;/a&gt;, were celebrated in an event held at the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Museum%20at%20L.A.%20Live\"&gt;Grammy Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, partly hosted by music journalist and television writer &lt;a href=\"David%20Wild\"&gt;David Wild&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Olivia%20Harrison\"&gt;Olivia&lt;/a&gt; and Dhani Harrison held an online competition in which filmmakers were invited to create a video clip for George Harrison's 1971 hit song \"&lt;a href=\"What%20Is%20Life\"&gt;What Is Life&lt;/a&gt;\". The winner received a $5000 cash prize and their entry became the official video for the track, appearing on the Harrison &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel and other media platforms.\nAn all-star concert, &lt;a href=\"George%20Fest\"&gt;George Fest&lt;/a&gt;, was held at the &lt;a href=\"Fonda%20Theatre\"&gt;Fonda Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles on 28 September.

Horowitz concludes of the set as a whole: \"Regardless of the eclectic nature of these albums and their often subpar material, George Harrison deserves the elaborate treatment he gets here, which makes this a worthwhile addition to any Beatle lovers' bulging collection \u2026\"&lt;ref name=\"Horowitz/AmSong\"&gt;Hal Horowitz, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20140928104340/https%3A//americansongwriter.com/2014/09/george-harrison-apple-years-1968-75/\"&gt;\"George Harrison: \"The Apple Years, 1968\u201375\"\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Songwriter\"&gt;American Songwriter&lt;/a&gt;\", 23 September 2014 (archived version from 28 September 2014; retrieved 21 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In a less favourable review for \"&lt;a href=\"Uncut%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Uncut&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Williams%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Richard Williams&lt;/a&gt; writes that \"only a devoted &lt;a href=\"Apple%20scruffs\"&gt;Apple scruff&lt;/a&gt; could love \"Extra Texture\", or its two immediate predecessors\", although he admires \"Wonderwall Music\" as an album that \"documents an innocent optimism that will always be worth a listen\".\n&lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; editor &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine\"&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine&lt;/a&gt; describes \"The Apple Years\" as \"a handsomely produced, impeccably remastered box set\" with the sound \"rich, deep, and alluring\". He writes of \"All Things Must Pass\" being \"rightly regarded as the masterpiece\" while highlighting \"Wonderwall Music\" as \"a bit of an unacknowledged gem, a frequently intriguing psychedelic relic that represents one of the first serious forays into &lt;a href=\"world%20music\"&gt;world music&lt;/a&gt; by a Western musician\". Erlewine concludes of the six albums: \"It's hard to deny the ups and downs to be found here, but combined they paint a picture of Harrison's complexities and contradictions, and the music has never sounded better \u2013 and each album has never looked better \u2013 than it does here.\"\nWhile viewing \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the only essential record\", Michael Gallucci of \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Classic%20Rock\"&gt;Ultimate Classic Rock&lt;/a&gt;\" writes: \"like all of his former bandmates' solo careers, Harrison's was spotty \u2026 [and] the seven years were marked by creative indulgences that didn't always pay off \u2026 When they did, the results were right up there with the best of the Beatles' solo material.\" In a review for the \"&lt;a href=\"Lexington%20Herald-Leader\"&gt;Lexington Herald-Leader&lt;/a&gt;\", Walter Tunis describes \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the finest solo album ever issued by a Beatle\" and an album that \"belongs in everyone's record collection\". Tunis considers \"Extra Texture\" to be \"a delight\", and writes of \"Living in the Material World\": \"Its appeal is strong, but the spiritual connections seem more obtuse and weighty at times \u2026 But there are stunners here, too \u2026\"\nWriting for \"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, Robert Ham views \"Material World\" as \"the album that benefits most from these remastering efforts\" and \"[the] one ripe for rediscovery\". Ham suggests that for die-hard Beatles fans, \"The Apple Years\" \"is essential listening to aid you in getting a little closer to appreciating Harrison's growth as an artist and as a human being\".&lt;ref name=\"Ham/Paste\"&gt;Robert Ham, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/09/george-harrison-the-apple-years-1968-1975-review.html\"&gt;\"George Harrison: \"The Apple Years: 1968\u20131975\" Review\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Paste%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paste&lt;/a&gt;\", 24 September 2014 (retrieved 25 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for \"The Second Disc\", Joe Marchese compliments the packaging and deems the box set \"beautiful inside and out\", adding: \"\"The Apple Years\" presents George Harrison in his many contradictions, but one thing that's crystal-clear is that the music he left behind is music to cherish.\"&lt;ref name=\"Marchese/Review\"&gt;Joe Marchese, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//theseconddisc.com/2014/09/23/review-the-george-harrison-remasters-the-apple-years-1968-1975/\"&gt;\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters \u2013 'The Apple Years 1968\u20131975'\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Second Disc\", 23 September 2014 (retrieved 25 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;"
