    "text": "Jarom\u00edr Bla\u017eek (; born 29 December 1972) is a Czech former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Brno\"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;, Bla\u017eek started his career in &lt;a href=\"SK%20Slavia%20Prague\"&gt;Slavia Prague&lt;/a&gt;, where he got to play his first league games. After two years during which he was mainly used as a substitute, he moved to &lt;a href=\"SK%20Dynamo%20%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9%20Bud%C4%9Bjovice\"&gt;Dynamo \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice&lt;/a&gt; to become the number one goalkeeper there. That &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;1992\u201393 season&lt;/a&gt; was to be the last of the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;Czechoslovak First League&lt;/a&gt;, and he decided to spend his first season in the new &lt;a href=\"Gambrinus%20liga\"&gt;Gambrinus liga&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"FK%20Viktoria%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEkov\"&gt;Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be a good choice since he won his first title, the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Cup\"&gt;national cup&lt;/a&gt;. He left after only one year though, moving across &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bohemians%201905\"&gt;FC Bohemians&lt;/a&gt;. They were relegated that year and Bla\u017eek, who did not want to spend a year in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%202.%20Liga\"&gt;Second League&lt;/a&gt;, was loaned for one year to his first club Slavia Prague, where again he was a substitute. Since Bohemians regained promotion the same year, he returned there and stayed for three and a half years.\nHowever, while his club was not performing very well, Bla\u017eek drew the attention of giants &lt;a href=\"Sparta%20Prague\"&gt;Sparta Prague&lt;/a&gt;, transferring there in early 2000 and winning back-to-back titles in 2000 and 2001. He went on loan to rivals &lt;a href=\"FK%20Marila%20P%C5%99%C3%ADbram\"&gt;Marila P\u0159\u00edbram&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 but returned after one year. After that, he played almost every single game for Sparta Prague, be it league, cup or &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; games. It was a very successful period for Bla\u017eek as he won four more titles and three national cups.\nIn 2007, he decided to move abroad and was sold to German club &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;1. FC N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt;, who purchased him as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Raphael%20Sch%C3%A4fer\"&gt;Raphael Sch\u00e4fer&lt;/a&gt; who had left for &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. Bla\u017eek was the number one there but fell sick in April and could not play the end of a season that saw N\u00fcrnberg being relegated. In June, it was announced that Bla\u017eek was returning to Sparta Prague for the following season. However, on 16 December 2011, Sparta Prague announced their decision to terminate Bla\u017eek's contract early, releasing him as a free agent. This was confirmed by the player's agent Pavel Paska.\nOn 22 February 2014, in a league match for Jihlava against &lt;a href=\"1.%20SC%20Znojmo\"&gt;Znojmo&lt;/a&gt;, Bla\u017eek kept his 139th clean sheet, setting a new goalkeeper record for the Czech league.\nInternational career.\nBla\u017eek made his debut for the national team on 29 March 2000 in a &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly match&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; that ended up in a 3\u20131 win. Due to the dominance of &lt;a href=\"Petr%20%C4%8Cech\"&gt;Petr \u010cech&lt;/a&gt; as the first-choice national team goalkeeper, Bla\u017eek was unable to make regular appearances for his nation. He was part of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; squad at both &lt;a href=\"2000%20UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2004%20UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;, but only played in one match during the two tournaments combined. He was also named in the Czech squad for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nHe is married and has two children \u2013 Jakub and Aneta. Bla\u017eek is the cousin of tennis player &lt;a href=\"Radek%20%C5%A0t%C4%9Bp%C3%A1nek\"&gt;Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer statistics.\nInternational.\nSource:\nHonours.\nClub.\nViktoria \u017di\u017ekov\nSlavia Prague\nBohemians 1905\nSparta Prague\nVyso\u010dina Jihlava\nInternational.\nCzech Republic\nIndividual.\n&lt;a href=\"Czech%20First%20League\"&gt;Czech First League&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Czech%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Czech Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt;"
