    "text": "Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal were an Indian composer duo, consisting of Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar (1937\u20131998) and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (born 1940). They are considered among the most successful composers in Hindi film history and composed music for about 750 Hindi movies from 1963 to 1998, working for almost all notable filmmakers, including &lt;a href=\"Raj%20Kapoor\"&gt;Raj Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dev%20Anand\"&gt;Dev Anand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shakti%20Samanta\"&gt;Shakti Samanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manmohan%20Desai\"&gt;Manmohan Desai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yash%20Chopra\"&gt;Yash Chopra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boney%20Kapoor\"&gt;Boney Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20Om%20Prakash\"&gt;J. Om Prakash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raj%20Khosla\"&gt;Raj Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%20V%20Prasad\"&gt;L V Prasad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Subhash%20Ghai\"&gt;Subhash Ghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%20Vishwanath\"&gt;K Viswanath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manoj%20Kumar\"&gt;Manoj Kumar&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nLaxmikant.\nLaxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar was born on the day of &lt;a href=\"Lakshmi%20Puja\"&gt;Laxmi Pujan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dipawali\"&gt;Dipawali&lt;/a&gt; on 3 November 1937. Probably, because of the day of his birth, his parents named him Laxmikant, after the goddess Laxmi. He spent his childhood amidst dire poverty in the slums of &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Parle\"&gt;Vile Parle&lt;/a&gt; (East) in &lt;a href=\"Mumbai\"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. His father died when he was a child. Because of the poor financial condition of the family he could not complete his academic education either. Laxmikant's father's friend, a musician himself, advised Laxmikant and his elder brother to learn music. Accordingly, Laxmikant learned to play the mandolin and his elder brother learned to play the tabla. He spent two years in the company of the well-known mandolin player Hussain Ali. He began organising and performing in Indian Classical instrumental music concerts to earn some money. Later, in the 1940s, he also learned mandolin from Bal Mukund Indorker and violin from Husnalal (of the &lt;a href=\"Husnlal%20Bhagatram\"&gt;Husanlal Bhagatram&lt;/a&gt; fame). Laxmikant began his film career as a child actor in the films \"Bhakt Pundalik\" (1949) and \"&lt;a href=\"Aankhen%20%281950%20film%29\"&gt;Aankhen&lt;/a&gt;\" (1950). He also acted in some &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20language\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; films.\nPyarelal.\nPyarelal Ramprasad Sharma (born 3 September 1940) is the son of a renowned trumpeter Pandit Ramprasad Sharma (popularly known as \"Babaji\"), who taught him the basics of music. He started learning violin at the age of 8 and practised it 8 to 12 hours daily. He learnt to play violin from a Goan musician named &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Gonsalves\"&gt;Anthony Gonsalves&lt;/a&gt;. The song \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Name%20Is%20Anthony%20Gonsalves%20%28song%29\"&gt;My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves&lt;/a&gt;\" from the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Amar%20Akbar%20Anthony\"&gt;Amar Akbar Anthony&lt;/a&gt;\" is regarded as a tribute to Mr. Gonsalves (the movie had music by Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal). By the age of 12, his family's financial condition had deteriorated, which in turn forced him to earn money by playing in studios. Pyarelal then used to frequent and play the violin in studios such as Ranjit Studios, to earn money for his family. Pyarelal's real life brother Gorakh Sharma played guitar for various songs composed by the duo Lakshmikant Pyarelal.\nIn an interview with Annu Kapoor recently, he has mentioned that he was quite an adept violinist and expert in western form of music. Pyarelal even thought to try his fortune in the West and wanted to become a regular orchestra player with a renowned group. Lakshmikant dissuaded him and then they started the amazing journey of music for Indian cinema.\nFormation of Music duo.\nWhen Laxmikant was about 10 years old, he once played mandolin in a &lt;a href=\"Lata%20Mangeshkar\"&gt;Lata Mangeshkar&lt;/a&gt; concert in Radio Club, &lt;a href=\"Colaba\"&gt;Colaba&lt;/a&gt;. Lata was so impressed that she talked to him after the concert.\nLaxmikant and Pyarelal met at \"Sureel Kala Kendra\", a music academy for children, run by the Mangeshkar family. After she came to know about their financially poor backgrounds, Lata recommended their names to music directors like &lt;a href=\"Naushad\"&gt;Naushad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sachin%20Dev%20Burman\"&gt;Sachin Dev Burman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"C.%20Ramchandra\"&gt;C. Ramchandra&lt;/a&gt;. Similar financial backgrounds and age made Laxmikant and Pyarelal very good friends. They used to spend long hours at the recording studios, sometimes getting work for each other and even playing together whenever they got the opportunity.\nPyarelal often used to frequent the Bombay Chamber Orchestra and the Paranjoti Academy, where he would perfect his skills in the company of Goody Seervai, Coomi Wadia, Mehli Mehta and his son, &lt;a href=\"Zubin%20Mehta\"&gt;Zubin Mehta&lt;/a&gt;. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal were not content with the payments being made to them for their music, so they decided to go to &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;). But, it was the same story there. So, they returned. Once Pyarelal decided to leave India and go to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; to play for symphony orchestras, just like &lt;a href=\"Zubin%20Mehta\"&gt;Zubin&lt;/a&gt;. However, he stayed back at Laxmikant's insistence. Some of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's colleagues at this time included Pandit &lt;a href=\"Shivkumar%20Sharma\"&gt;Shivkumar Sharma&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Santoor\"&gt;Santoor&lt;/a&gt;) and Pandit &lt;a href=\"Hariprasad%20Chaurasia\"&gt;Hariprasad Chaurasia&lt;/a&gt; (flute). Later, Shivkumar and Hariprasad also ventured into Hindi Cinema as &lt;a href=\"Shiv-Hari\"&gt;Shiv-Hari&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal worked with almost all well-reputed music directors (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"O.%20P.%20Nayyar\"&gt;O. P. Nayyar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shankar%E2%80%93Jaikishan\"&gt;Shankar\u2013Jaikishan&lt;/a&gt; though Laxmikant used to play mandolin in Shankar Jaikishan songs) of the 1950s. In 1953, they became assistants to &lt;a href=\"Kalyanji-Anandji\"&gt;Kalyanji-Anandji&lt;/a&gt; and worked with them as assistants till 1963. They worked as music arrangers for many music directors including &lt;a href=\"Sachin%20Dev%20Burman\"&gt;Sachin Dev Burman&lt;/a&gt; (in \"Ziddi\") and also for his son &lt;a href=\"Rahul%20Dev%20Burman\"&gt;Rahul Dev Burman&lt;/a&gt; (in his first film \"Chhote Nawab\"). Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal and R D Burman remained very good friends, even when Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal started giving music independently. R D Burman played mouth organ for the two of songs of \"Dosti\". Laxmikant once made a guest appearance playing himself as a composer of the Song \"Dil Ki Baat\" in \"Teri Kasam\" (1982), which had music by R D Burman.\nMusic career.\nIn their early days, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's music was very similar to &lt;a href=\"Shankar%E2%80%93Jaikishan\"&gt;Shankar\u2013Jaikishan&lt;/a&gt;'s music, as Laxmikant was a great fan of theirs. Once Shankar even changed his orchestration to make sure that his music did not sound like Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's. Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal's first film as music directors was not released. The first released movie which featured them as music directors was &lt;a href=\"Babubhai%20Mistry\"&gt;Babubhai Mistry&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Parasmani\"&gt;Parasmani&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963), which was a costume drama. All the songs of the film became immensely popular, esp. \"Hansta Hua Nurani Chehara\", \"Wo Jab Yaad Aaye\" and \"Mere Dil Main Halki Si\". Throughout their tenure as music directors, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal only used A-grade singers. Their mentors, &lt;a href=\"Lata%20Mangeshkar\"&gt;Lata Mangeshkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Rafi\"&gt;Mohammad Rafi&lt;/a&gt; agreed to sing for them in spite of low budgets, and Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal always remained indebted to them. In fact, all three, Lata, Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle have sung the highest number of songs in their career for Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal. They continued to give patronage to Mohammed Rafi, sometimes against filmmakers' wishes. They had a great rapport with &lt;a href=\"Kishore%20Kumar\"&gt;Kishore Kumar&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;a href=\"Kishore%20Kumar\"&gt;Kishore Kumar&lt;/a&gt; sang the most songs (402) for L-P among all male singers, followed by Rafi (about 388 songs).\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal hit the big time with Rajshri Productions' 1964 film \"&lt;a href=\"Dosti\"&gt;Dosti&lt;/a&gt;\". The film had two newcomer heroes who never became popular, and the film was a success due to its music. Songs like \"Chahoonga Main Tujhe Shaam Savere\" and \"Rahi Manwa\" became very popular. At that time, many used to think that there was a single person by the name of \"Laxmikant Pyarelal\". Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal won their first &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Music%20Director%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Best Music Director Award&lt;/a&gt; for the movie, ahead of stalwarts like &lt;a href=\"Shankar%E2%80%93Jaikishan\"&gt;Shankar\u2013Jaikishan&lt;/a&gt; (for \"&lt;a href=\"Sangam%20%281964%20Hindi%20film%29\"&gt;Sangam&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"Madan%20Mohan%20%28director%29\"&gt;Madan Mohan&lt;/a&gt; (for \"&lt;a href=\"Woh%20Kaun%20Thi%3F\"&gt;Woh Kaun Thi?&lt;/a&gt;\"). Then came \"Lootera\", a superhit musical non-star cast film, which is remembered only because of Lata Manageshkar's superhit songs with Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal.\nIn 1967, L-P consolidated their position in the Hindi film industry with a series of hits, one after another. Non star cast film \"&lt;a href=\"Farz%20%281967%20film%29\"&gt;Farz&lt;/a&gt;\" was L-P's first golden jubilee musical hit, followed by big star cast films such as \"&lt;a href=\"Anita%20%281967%20film%29\"&gt;Anita&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shagird\"&gt;Shagird&lt;/a&gt;\", yet another Golden Jubilee hit, \"&lt;a href=\"Patthar%20Ke%20Sanam\"&gt;Patthar Ke Sanam&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Night in London\", \"&lt;a href=\"Jaal%20%281967%20film%29\"&gt;Jaal&lt;/a&gt;\" and another evergreen musical hit \"&lt;a href=\"Milan%20%281967%20film%29\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;\". L-P received their second Filmfare Trophy for \"Milan\" without any stiff competition.\nThe rise of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal, &lt;a href=\"Rahul%20Dev%20Burman\"&gt;Rahul Dev Burman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kalyanji-Anandji\"&gt;Kalyanji-Anandji&lt;/a&gt; marked the end of an old era of Bollywood music, which had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Jaidev\"&gt;Jaidev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shankar%E2%80%93Jaikishan\"&gt;Shankar\u2013Jaikishan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sachin%20Dev%20Burman\"&gt;Sachin Dev Burman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naushad\"&gt;Naushad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C.%20Ramchandra\"&gt;C. Ramchandra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khayyam%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Khayyam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madan%20Mohan%20%28director%29\"&gt;Madan Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"O.%20P.%20Nayyar\"&gt;O. P. Nayyar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roshan%20%28music%20director%29\"&gt;Roshan&lt;/a&gt; and others. Big film producing names, such as &lt;a href=\"Prasad%20Studios\"&gt;Prasad Productions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajshri%20Productions\"&gt;Rajshri Productions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.%20Om%20Prakash\"&gt;J. Om Prakash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raj%20Khosla\"&gt;Raj Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manoj%20Kumar\"&gt;Manoj Kumar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramanand%20Sagar\"&gt;Ramanand Sagar&lt;/a&gt;, Madan Mohla, Mohan Sahagal, V.Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra, Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai and many more, started replacing their regular music directors and preferred Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal on a regular basis, and in return L-P have given outstanding music to justify the replacement among the big names.\nOne of the most important associations that the duo developed was with lyricist &lt;a href=\"Anand%20Bakshi\"&gt;Anand Bakshi&lt;/a&gt;. The team of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal and lyricist &lt;a href=\"Anand%20Bakshi\"&gt;Anand Bakshi&lt;/a&gt; churned out some of the most popular songs in Hindi Cinemas history. The combo composed songs for more than 250 movies. Anand Bakshi was the lyricist who wrote the maximum number of texts Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal gave music to. He was actually the lyricist for all the films for which Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal won &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Music%20Director%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Awards&lt;/a&gt;, except their very first award.\nActor &lt;a href=\"Rajesh%20Khanna\"&gt;Rajesh Khanna&lt;/a&gt; kept Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal as music director for 26 of his films.\nAnother great collaboration was with &lt;a href=\"Asha%20Bhonsle\"&gt;Asha Bhonsle&lt;/a&gt;. She has sung many hits under their baton. \"Dhal Gaya Din\" (with Rafi) in \"&lt;a href=\"Humjoli\"&gt;Humjoli&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970) became a superhit. \"Roz Roz Rozy\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Khilona%20%281970%20film%29\"&gt;Khilona&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970), \"Bane Bade Raja\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Abhinetri%20%281970%20film%29\"&gt;Abhinetri&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970), \"Hungama Ho Gaya\" and \"Balma Hamar Motorcar Leke Aayo\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Anhonee%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Anhonee&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974), \"Aye Mere Nanhe Gulfam\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Jagriti\"&gt;Jagriti&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), \"Aaiye Shauk Se Kahiye\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Parvarish%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;Parvarish&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), \"Teri Rab Ne\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Suhaag%20%281979%20film%29\"&gt;Suhaag&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979), \"Ek Hasina Thi\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Karz%20%28film%29\"&gt;Karz&lt;/a&gt;\" (1980), \"Are Bhaago Are Dauro\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Bandish%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Bandish&lt;/a&gt;\" (1980), \"Man Kyun Behka Re\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Utsav\"&gt;Utsav&lt;/a&gt;\" (1985), \"Balram Ne Bahut Samjhaya\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Ram%20Balram\"&gt;Ram Balram&lt;/a&gt;\" (1990) etc. They recorded the second most songs with Asha Bhosle.

The song was later re-recorded for the 2014 film \"&lt;a href=\"Queen%20%282014%20film%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;\", with additional voice by &lt;a href=\"Arijit%20Singh\"&gt;Arijit Singh&lt;/a&gt;, it again hit the top charts and became a superhit. \"Man Kyun Behka Re\" with Lata was also a hit and several blockbusters by L-P had Asha as lead voice in films such as \"&lt;a href=\"Suhaag%20%281979%20film%29\"&gt;Suhaag&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Vakil%20Babu\"&gt;Vakil Babu&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dostana%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Dostana&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Adha%20Din%20Adhi%20Raat\"&gt;Adha Din Adhi Raat&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Loha%20%281987%20film%29\"&gt;Loha&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Anhonee%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Anhonee&lt;/a&gt;\" etc. to name a few.\nStyle of music.\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal composed &lt;a href=\"Indian%20classical%20music\"&gt;Indian classical music&lt;/a&gt; as well as Western music; they were most popular for their &lt;a href=\"folk%20song\"&gt;folk tune&lt;/a&gt;s and semi-classical music. For \"Shagird\", they composed &lt;a href=\"Rock-n-Roll\"&gt;Rock-n-Roll&lt;/a&gt;-style melodies, and in \"&lt;a href=\"Karz%20%28film%29\"&gt;Karz&lt;/a&gt;\" the music is closer to &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;. For this film they wrote a Westernised version of a Ghazal, \"Dard-e-dil Dard-e- jigar\", and they received the &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Music%20Director%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Best Music Director Award&lt;/a&gt; for the year.\nBinaca Geet Mala.\nLP dominated the Weekly Hindi Film songs Countdown programme &lt;a href=\"Binaca%20Geet%20Mala\"&gt;Binaca Geet Mala&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular musical radio programme of its time.

Rafi Sahab sang for L-P for free and blessed them that - \"This music Duo may work together to their last breath.\" Therefore, Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal always respected Rafi till the end and Rafi sang his last song- \"Tere Aane Ki Aas Hai Dost...\" under direction of L-P, which was recorded on 31 July 1980 in Mahboob studio at 10:00 PM.

In 1977, L-P brought back the glory of Mohammed Rafi through \"Amar Akbar Anthony\" and \"Sargam\".\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal also worked with &lt;a href=\"Mukesh%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Mukesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manna%20Dey\"&gt;Manna Dey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahendra%20Kapoor\"&gt;Mahendra Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amit%20Kumar%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Amit Kumar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alka%20Yagnik\"&gt;Alka Yagnik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Udit%20Narayan\"&gt;Udit Narayan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shailender%20Singh\"&gt;Shailender Singh&lt;/a&gt;, P.

However, they also gave big breaks to many newcomers such as &lt;a href=\"Kavita%20Krishnamurthy\"&gt;Kavita Krishnamurthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20Aziz\"&gt;Mohammed Aziz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suresh%20Wadkar\"&gt;Suresh Wadkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shabbir%20Kumar\"&gt;Shabbir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sukhwinder%20Singh\"&gt;Sukhwinder Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinod%20Rathod\"&gt;Vinod Rathod&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Roop%20Kumar%20Rathod\"&gt;Roop Kumar Rathod&lt;/a&gt;. L-P always wanted to engage the voice of Talat Mahmood so they specially composed a very melodious song \"Mohabbat Ki Kahaniyan\" in 1971 for the film \"Wo Din Yaad Karo\" in which Lata accompanied Talat.\nOn 7 May 2011, the event house Kakas Entertainment arranged a show called Maestros, by Pyarelal, in which they revived old songs with singers such as, &lt;a href=\"Anuradha%20Paudwal\"&gt;Anuradha Paudwal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonu%20Nigam\"&gt;Sonu Nigam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alka%20Yagnik\"&gt;Alka Yagnik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kavita%20Krishnamurthy\"&gt;Kavita Krishnamurthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudesh%20Bhosle\"&gt;Sudesh Bhosle&lt;/a&gt; and many other Bollywood singers.\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal are the only composers who assembled the legendary singers &lt;a href=\"Kishore%20Kumar\"&gt;Kishore Kumar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Rafi\"&gt;Mohammad Rafi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mukesh%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Mukesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lata%20Mangeshkar\"&gt;Lata Mangeshkar&lt;/a&gt; together, for the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar Kya Kare\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Amar%20Akbar%20Anthony\"&gt;Amar Akbar Anthony&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter Laxmikant's death.\nAfter Laxmikant's death, Pyarelal has done some work independently. Yet, Pyarelal always used the name 'Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal' for all the future compositions. When the playback singer &lt;a href=\"Kumar%20Sanu\"&gt;Kumar Sanu&lt;/a&gt; turned music director, he approached Pyarelal to arrange music for him. Pyarelal was approached to assist in the music of Farah Khan's \"&lt;a href=\"Om%20Shanti%20Om\"&gt;Om Shanti Om&lt;/a&gt;\" song \"Dhoom Tana\". In 2009 Pyarelal won the Sachin Dev Burman International Award for Creative Sound and Music at the Pune Film Festival. Pyarelal has done a show with Kakas Entertainment called Maestros: A musical Journey of Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal.\nAwards.\nAfter Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelalji made their debut as a music director duo in 1963, they were nominated for &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Director\"&gt;Best Music&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Awards\"&gt;Filmfare Awards&lt;/a&gt; almost every year. Many times, they were nominated for 3 or more films in a particular year. At the same time, L-P narrowly missed the awards for musical hits like \"Aaye Din Bahar Ke\", \"Intaqam\", \"Do Raaste\", \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\", \"Shor\", \"Daag\", \"Bobby\", \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\", \"Prem Rog, Utsav\", \"Sur Sangam\", \"Farz\", \"Shagird\", \"Tezaab\", \"Hero\" and \"Mr. India\".\nLaxmikant\u2013Pyarelal received won 7 awards and 15 nominations."
