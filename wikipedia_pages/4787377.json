    "text": "Klaksv\u00edkar \u00cdtr\u00f3ttarfelag (&lt;a href=\"Faroese%20language\"&gt;Faroese&lt;/a&gt; for \"Sports Club of Klaksv\u00edk\"), commonly known as K\u00cd, is a &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroese&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Klaksv%C3%ADk\"&gt;Klaksv\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. The club was founded in 1904 and is one of the most successful Faroese football clubs, having won the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Faroe Islands Premier League&lt;/a&gt; 18 times and the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands%20Cup\"&gt;Faroe Islands Cup&lt;/a&gt; 6 times. The club wears blue and white and plays matches at the &lt;a href=\"Vi%C3%B0%20Dj%C3%BApum%C3%BDrar\"&gt;Vi\u00f0 Dj\u00fapum\u00fdrar&lt;/a&gt; stadium.\nHistory.\nK\u00cd won the inaugural edition of &lt;a href=\"1942%20Meistaradeildin\"&gt;Faroese top-tier football in 1942&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992, K\u00cd Klaksv\u00edk participated for the first time on a European stage, competing in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; preliminary round against &lt;a href=\"Skonto%20Riga\"&gt;Skonto Riga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, where they lost 6\u20131 on aggregate.\nBy winning the &lt;a href=\"double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, K\u00cd reached a total of 17 league titles, a record at the time. K\u00cd didn't win the league title again until &lt;a href=\"2019%20Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, and although it held the honour of having won the most league titles since the 1950s, it was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"HB%20T%C3%B3rshavn\"&gt;HB&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Although the team signed former great Todi J\u00f3nsson and local &lt;a href=\"Atli%20Danielsen\"&gt;Atli Danielsen&lt;/a&gt; in July 2009 for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;, K\u00cd was relegated for the first time in the club's 105 year-long history at the time. Despite a slow start, they managed to return to the top league for 2011, when they finished fifth under the guidance of manager Aleksandar \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107.\nIn 2012, K\u00cd did one better than the previous year, and finished in 4th position. The team was the most potent attacking side, scoring 59 goals in 27 matches; P\u00e1ll Klettskar\u00f0 scored 22 goals and was the joint top-scorer. In the buildup to the 2013 season, Atli Danielsen and Meinhardt Joensen were signed, helping K\u00cd to reach the semi-final of the cup. However, they finished the league season in a disappointing 8th place. Ndende Adama Gu\u00e9ye was signed after the season, and the team hired a new manager, Mikkjal Thomassen, who has managed the team until the present. The new manager implemented a new system, foreign to most of the players, and so K\u00cd experienced a difficult start to the season. Later in the first half of the season, the team had implemented the style, playing attractive, free-flowing attacking football, eventually finishing fifth. &lt;a href=\"2016%20Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;In 2016&lt;/a&gt;, they missed out on their first league title since 1999 by just one point to &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADkingur%20G%C3%B8ta\"&gt;V\u00edkingur G\u00f8ta&lt;/a&gt;, although they did win the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands%20Cup\"&gt;Faroe Islands Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The next year, they lost the title to the same team by an even closer margin, only having a slightly worse goal difference. While the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;next season&lt;/a&gt; was a disappointment, with the team only finishing fifth, the following years, starting with &lt;a href=\"2019%20Faroe%20Islands%20Premier%20League\"&gt;the 2019 season&lt;/a&gt; would prove remarkable ones.\nThat year, K\u00cd not only won their first title in twenty years, but they managed to reach the second qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, defeating &lt;a href=\"FK%20Riteriai\"&gt;Riteriai&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; on away goals. In 2020, K\u00cd went one better, becoming the first Faroese team to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round%20%28Champions%20Path%29\"&gt;Europa League playoff&lt;/a&gt; round by beating &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi\"&gt;Dinamo Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20131 in the third qualifying round, which K\u00cd had reached for the first time. This shock result, against a much larger and more prestigious European club, was watched by seventy percent of the &lt;a href=\"Klaksvik\"&gt;Klaksvik&lt;/a&gt; population, and set up what was labelled 'the biggest game in their history' against the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Dundalk%20F.C\"&gt;Dundalk F.C&lt;/a&gt;, which they lost 3\u20131.\nStadium.\nK\u00cd Klaksv\u00edk plays its games in &lt;a href=\"Vi%C3%B0%20Dj%C3%BApum%C3%BDrar\"&gt;Vi\u00f0 Dj\u00fapum\u00fdrar&lt;/a&gt;, a stadium with a capacity of 530 (2600 with standing places). For the team's 2020 European qualification, the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%B3rsv%C3%B8llur\"&gt;T\u00f3rsv\u00f8llur&lt;/a&gt; stadium, which normally hosts the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; was used, since the Vi\u00f0 Dj\u00fapum\u00fdrar stadium did not meet &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; requirements for the third qualifying round and above."
