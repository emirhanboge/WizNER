    "text": "Broomfield Park was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; stadium in &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%2C%20North%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;Airdrie, North Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt;, home of &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt; from 1892 until it was closed after the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1993\u201394 football season&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirdrieonians F.C. was formed in 1878 and the club opened Broomfield in 1892. The Broomfield corner pavilion was built in 1907. After winning the &lt;a href=\"1923%E2%80%9324%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1923\u201324 Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the club built a main stand, adjacent to the pavilion. The &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20football%20attendance%20records\"&gt;record attendance&lt;/a&gt; at Broomfield Park was 24,000, in a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; quarter-final match against &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; on 8 March 1952. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and a roof was built over the Enclosure (opposite the main stand) in 1959. The ground was unusually narrow, at just 67 yards wide, and was built in a natural hollow. These physical features, and the proximity of the stands to the pitch, meant that Broomfield had a particularly raucous and oppressive atmosphere when crowded, which visiting clubs disliked but was advantageous to the home side.\nAirdrieonians first explored the options for moving from Broomfield in 1989. A planning application was rejected by a public inquiry in 1993, but that same hearing allowed Broomfield to be redeveloped as a &lt;a href=\"supermarket\"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;. Airdrieonians chose to sell Broomfield to supermarket chain &lt;a href=\"Safeway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; (now a Morrison's supermarket after the latter taking over the former's UK stores) despite not having an alternative ground ready to move into. The last game at Broomfield was played on 7 May 1994 and the club then shared &lt;a href=\"Broadwood%20Stadium\"&gt;Broadwood Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cumbernauld\"&gt;Cumbernauld&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt;. Monklands District backed a plan for a 10,000-seat stadium at Raebog, but the proposal was rejected by &lt;a href=\"Strathclyde%20Region\"&gt;Strathclyde Region&lt;/a&gt; in October 1995. A proposal for a site at Craigneuk was rejected by Monklands District in April 1996. After four years at Broadwood, Airdrieonians moved into the &lt;a href=\"Excelsior%20Stadium\"&gt;Shyberry Excelsior Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. Airdrieonians was liquidated in 2002 and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Airdrie United&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2013, the Scottish Football Association permitted Airdrie United to formally change their name back to Airdrieonians."
