    "text": "The Taipei Liaison Office in the Republic of South Africa () &lt;a href=\"Taipei%20Economic%20and%20Cultural%20Representative%20Office\"&gt;represents the interests&lt;/a&gt; of Taiwan in South Africa in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, functioning as a &lt;a href=\"de%20facto%20embassy\"&gt;\"de facto\" embassy&lt;/a&gt;. Its counterpart in Taiwan is the &lt;a href=\"Liaison%20Office%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Liaison Office of the Republic of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Taipei\"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. It has two offices, one in &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt; and the other in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Office is headed by a Representative, currently Matthew Chou. \nIt has responsibility for the &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gauteng\"&gt;Gauteng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Limpopo%20Province\"&gt;Limpopo Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20%28South%20African%20province%29\"&gt;North-West Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KwaZulu-Natal\"&gt;KwaZulu-Natal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mpumalanga\"&gt;Mpumalanga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20%28province%29\"&gt;Free State&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nThe Office was formerly the Embassy of the Republic of China. However, when South Africa recognised the People's Republic of China, its diplomatic relations with Taiwan were terminated. This led to the establishment of the Office in 1998. \nThe Office has responsibility for the interests of Taiwan in other African countries, such as Mauritius, Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Eritrea, Angola, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Lesotho, as well as the French &lt;a href=\"overseas%20region\"&gt;overseas region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9union\"&gt;R\u00e9union&lt;/a&gt;. \nTaiwan previously had &lt;a href=\"Malawi%E2%80%93Taiwan%20relations\"&gt;diplomatic relations with Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, and was represented in the country by the Embassy of the Republic of China in &lt;a href=\"Lilongwe\"&gt;Lilongwe&lt;/a&gt;. Lesotho, which established relations with Taipei in 1966, switched recognition to &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; in 1983.\nCape Town office.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Taipei%20Liaison%20Office%20in%20Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town Office&lt;/a&gt; has responsibility for the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Cape\"&gt;Western Cape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Cape\"&gt;Northern Cape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Cape\"&gt;Eastern Cape&lt;/a&gt; as well as Namibia. \nThere was also previously an office in &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the Consulate-General of the Republic of China. However, owing to financial considerations and the city's proximity to Pretoria, it was closed in 2009. \nA Liaison Office was also located in &lt;a href=\"Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt;, but has since closed. Prior to the ending of diplomatic relations, this had been a Consulate General."
