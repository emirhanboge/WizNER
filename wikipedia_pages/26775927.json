    "text": "Au\u00f0ur Capital was a &lt;a href=\"financial%20service\"&gt;financial service&lt;/a&gt; company, founded in 2007 by two &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;ic businesswomen, with the aim of incorporating feminine values into finance. &lt;a href=\"Halla%20T%C3%B3masd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Halla T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt; was Au\u00f0ur's executive chairman and Krist\u00edn P\u00e9tursd\u00f3ttir was the company CEO.\nThe company offered wealth management, private equity advice and corporate advice. It attempted to correct what it perceived as a historic lack of balance and diversity in the financial sector. The founders blamed the 2007 financial downturn on high-risk behavior, short-term orientation and a narrow definition of results which had driven the financial sector for the past years.\nAu\u00f0ur succeeded in preserving the funds of its clients when the Icelandic banks collapsed in October 2008.\nIn December 2008 Au\u00f0ur announced the launching of BJ\u00d6RK, a &lt;a href=\"private%20equity%20fund\"&gt;private equity fund&lt;/a&gt;, established by Au\u00f0ur Capital and the renowned musician &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rk\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt;, who is an active supporter of entrepreneurship, creative thinking and increased diversity in the Icelandic economy. \nThe aim of the BJ\u00d6RK venture fund was to invest in early-stage corporations, with high growth potential capitalizing on Iceland's human and/or natural resources, as well as emphasizing sustainability and a triple bottom line.\nAu\u00f0ur received significant international attention. The Au\u00f0ur story has been featured by the BBC, New York Magazine, The Guardian, and The Financial Times, among others. Halla Tomasd\u00f3ttir spoke at the 2010 TED Women's Conference on her financial philosophy.\nMerger in 2014.\nAu\u00f0ur Capital started its operations in 2007 and merged with the financial services firm Vir\u00f0ing in January 2014. The merged company operates under the name Vir\u00f0ing.\nThe Icelandic Competition Authority authorized the merger at the end of 2013 as well as the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority in January 2014.\nVir\u00f0ing owns the Au\u00f0ur Capital brand and operates several private equity funds using the \"Au\u00f0ur\" name."
