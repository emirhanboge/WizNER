    "text": "Jurassic 5 is the first official release by American &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Jurassic%205\"&gt;Jurassic 5&lt;/a&gt;. It is an &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt; that includes much of the material that would later appear on the full-length album \"&lt;a href=\"Jurassic%205%20%28album%29\"&gt;Jurassic 5&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRelease.\nThe first version of the EP to be released contained nine tracks and was available in &lt;a href=\"CD%20single\"&gt;CD single&lt;/a&gt; or double-&lt;a href=\"12%26quot%3B%20single\"&gt;12\" single&lt;/a&gt; formats. It was released in October 1997 on the band's own short-lived label, Rumble Records.\nAlthough the label only released one record, it did give the band a platform and allowed them to be heard.\nThe band signed to a major label, &lt;a href=\"Interscope%20Records\"&gt;Interscope Records&lt;/a&gt;, in 1999. Their first release on Interscope was the re-issue of the \"Jurassic 5\" EP in an 8-track version in 1999. This had the same listing as the original EP, excluding the final track \"Blacktop Beat\"."
