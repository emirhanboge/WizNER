    "text": "The Clarion Defender was an &lt;a href=\"African-American%20newspapers\"&gt;African American run newspaper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. It operated from 1966 until around 1973 and was founded by Jimmy \"Bang Bang\" Walker. Its motto was, \"Oldest Negro Publisher in the Northwest.\"\nThe \"Northwest Clarion\", initially published between 1943 and 1961, was revived under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Civil%20and%20political%20rights\"&gt;civil rights advocate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; journalist Jimmy \"Bang-Bang\" Walker. In January 1962, Jimmy \"Bang-Bang\" Walker took an investment of $15,000 and founded, edited, and published the \"Northwest Defender\". Five years later Walker took over the \"Northwest Clarion\", which had suspended publication, and renamed it the \"Clarion Defender\". The paper was alternately known as the \"Northwest Clarion Defender\" and \"New Northwest Clarion Defender\". It was located at 1223 NE &lt;a href=\"Alberta%20Arts%20District\"&gt;Alberta Street&lt;/a&gt; (Portland, Oregon). In addition to the \"Clarion Defender\", the city also had the \"&lt;a href=\"Portland%20Challenger\"&gt;Portland Challenger&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952\u201354), the \"&lt;a href=\"Portland%20Times\"&gt;Portland Times&lt;/a&gt;\" (1918\u201320), and numerous other &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20African-American%20newspapers%20in%20Oregon\"&gt;African American newspapers&lt;/a&gt; that lasted a year or less with a few dating back to the 1890s.\nThe \"Clarion Defender\" focused attention on the impact of local issues on &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African-Americans&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0routinely used the newspaper to expose purported police brutality. In reaction to the &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Walker used the paper to express continued commitment to Dr. King's goals and non-violent approach to achieve them.\nJimmy \"Bang-Bang\" Walker.\nJames Zell \"Jimmy\" Walker, Jr. was born on March 23, 1932, in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; to Emma Lou and James Zell Walker, Sr. Jimmy had a brother by the name of Ivory Mitchell Walker, half-brothers Grady William \"Sonny\" Owens, and Harvey Lee Black, Jr., sister Denise Walker, and half-sister Gail V. Black.\nJimmy's father died in 1936 when Jimmy was four years old. The family then moved to &lt;a href=\"Vallejo%2C%20California\"&gt;Vallejo, California&lt;/a&gt;. In 1940 at the age of eight, Jimmy was making $25.00 a week selling newspapers and picking fruit. Jimmy remembers: \u201cOur mother taught us to be proud. That hard work is the foundation for good health and a good mind. We never went on welfare, we all worked.\u201d In 1941, Jimmy won the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gloves\"&gt;California Junior Golden Gloves&lt;/a&gt; in his division for &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, and in high school he had won letters in all four available sports: &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Track%20and%20field\"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 4, 2005, Jimmy \"Bang-Bang\" Walker passed away at age 73 due to natural causes at his home in &lt;a href=\"North%20Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;North Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. On October 8, 2005, a service was held at the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20High%20School%20%28Portland%2C%20Oregon%29\"&gt;Jefferson High School&lt;/a&gt; auditorium in his honor. Walker was deeply appreciated by his community. \"It\u2019s a real loss to the African American community in terms of the commitment that he had to fostering our community, helping young men and women to take pride in and learn about their culture,\" said &lt;a href=\"Halim%20Rahsaan\"&gt;Halim Rahsaan&lt;/a&gt;, a former amateur boxer. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Hopson\"&gt;Tony Hopson&lt;/a&gt;, who was founder, President, and chief executive officer of &lt;a href=\"Self%20Enhancement%20Inc.\"&gt;Self Enhancement Inc.&lt;/a&gt; said, \"He was a real role model\u2026 at a time when a lot of folks of color in this city weren\u2019t as eager to jump out there and try new things, he did the &lt;a href=\"Miss%20Tan%20America%20Beauty%20Pageant\"&gt;Miss Tan America Beauty Pageant&lt;/a&gt; at a time when folks needed to feel good about themselves, and really weren\u2019t in a position to compete in some of the other kinds of pageants. We looked at that as a real positive.\"\nExternal links.\nDigital versions of related newspapers:"
