    "text": "Charles Ganilh (6 January 1758 \u2013 1836) was a French &lt;a href=\"economist\"&gt;economist&lt;/a&gt; and politician.\nHe was born at &lt;a href=\"Allanche\"&gt;Allanche&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cantal\"&gt;Cantal&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated for a profession in law and practised as \"avocat\". During the troubled period which culminated in the taking of the &lt;a href=\"Bastille\"&gt;Bastille&lt;/a&gt; on 14 July 1789, he became prominent in public affairs, and was one of the seven members of the permanent &lt;a href=\"Committee%20of%20Public%20Safety\"&gt;Committee of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt;.\nGanilh was imprisoned during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt; and was only released by the counter-revolution of the &lt;a href=\"9th%20Thermidor\"&gt;9th Thermidor&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"first%20consulate\"&gt;first consulate&lt;/a&gt; he was called to the &lt;a href=\"tribunate\"&gt;tribunate&lt;/a&gt; but was excluded in 1802.\nIn 1815 he was elected deputy for Cantal and finally left the Chamber on its dissolution in 1823.\nGanilh is best known as the most vigorous defender of the &lt;a href=\"mercantile%20school\"&gt;mercantile school&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to the views of &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Smith\"&gt;Adam Smith&lt;/a&gt; and the English economists.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mercantilism\"&gt;mercantilists&lt;/a&gt; were believers in nations keeping a positive balance of trade at all times in order to prosper, economically. However, they also valued the maximization of the national domestic resources of that nation and a total ban on the export of gold and silver. In pursuit of the positive balance of trade they recommended expansion of the colonial system, exclusivity of trade with the colonies and forbidding trade carried in foreign ships. Britain attempted to follow the &lt;a href=\"Mercantilism\"&gt;mercantilists'&lt;/a&gt; suggestions and found themselves involved in frequent trade wars like the four &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Dutch%20Wars\"&gt;Anglo-Dutch Navigation Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the scale of the individual sale, the &lt;a href=\"Mercantilism\"&gt;mercantilists&lt;/a&gt; believed that profit arose only during the sale of commodities by the seller over-charging the buyer. Thus, Ganilh says that \"exchange or trade alone gives value to things.\" In his mercantile outlook, Ganilh rejected the general labor theory of &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Smith\"&gt;Adam Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Ricardo\"&gt;David Ricardo&lt;/a&gt; in which commodities have value from the beginning. Commodities obtain value only through the labor that is used to prepare the commodity for market. \nHis works on &lt;a href=\"political%20economy\"&gt;political economy&lt;/a&gt; are clear and concise. His writings include \"Essai politique sur le revenue des peuples de l'antiquit\u00e9, du moyen \u00e2ge, &amp;c.\" (1808), \"Des syst\u00e8mes d'\u00e9conomie politique\" (1809), \"Th\u00e9orie d'\u00e9conomie politique\" (1815), and \"Dictionnaire analytique d'\u00e9conomie politique\" (1826)."
