    "text": "Khaw Boon Wan (; born 8 December 1952) is a retired Singaporean politician. A member of the governing &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Action%20Party\"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP), he was a Member of Parliament representing the Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) of &lt;a href=\"Tanjong%20Pagar%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Tanjong Pagar&lt;/a&gt; (2001\u20132006) and &lt;a href=\"Sembawang%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Sembawang&lt;/a&gt; (2006\u20132020). He also held positions in the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; from 2003 to 2020, including &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Minister for Health&lt;/a&gt; (2003\u20132011), &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20National%20Development%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Minister for National Development&lt;/a&gt; (2011\u20132015), and &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Transport%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Minister for Transport&lt;/a&gt; (2015\u20132020). During his political career, Khaw was noted for being appointed to ministerial portfolios which deal with &lt;a href=\"Wedge%20issue\"&gt;hot button issues&lt;/a&gt; such as housing and transport, thus earning himself the moniker \"Mr. Fix-it\".\nFollowing his retirement from politics in 2020, Khaw has become the chairman of a not-for-profit media entity set up by &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Press%20Holdings\"&gt;Singapore Press Holdings&lt;/a&gt; after it underwent a restructuring of its media operations in 2021.\nEarly career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Malaya\"&gt;Federation of Malaya&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;) to a &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese\"&gt;Malaysian Chinese&lt;/a&gt; family, Khaw moved to Singapore in 1977 and began his career in the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Civil%20Service\"&gt;Singapore Civil Service&lt;/a&gt;, working at the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Ministry of Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Khaw served as the first &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Executive%20Officer\"&gt;Chief Executive Officer&lt;/a&gt; (CEO) of the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20Hospital\"&gt;National University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. He also worked in the &lt;a href=\"Kandang%20Kerbau%20Women%27s%20and%20Children%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Singapore General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1992 to 1995, Khaw served as the Principal Private Secretary to &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goh%20Chok%20Tong\"&gt;Goh Chok Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1995 to 2001, he served as the Permanent Secretary at the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Ministry of Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical career.\nKhaw contested in the &lt;a href=\"Tanjong%20Pagar%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Tanjong Pagar GRC&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Singaporean%20general%20election\"&gt;2001 general election&lt;/a&gt; and was successfully elected to be a Member of Parliament. \nSARS outbreak.\nKhaw played a key role in combating the &lt;a href=\"Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome\"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; epidemic that happened between February to June 2003 while as Senior Minister of State for Health, which put a strain on and tested Singapore's public health resources. Khaw then took over as acting Health Minister from 1 August 2003 before being promoted to a full Minister on 12 August 2004 in the cabinet of the new Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hsien%20Loong\"&gt;Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinister for Health (2004 - 2011).\nKhaw was noted for his role in handling the &lt;a href=\"National%20Kidney%20Foundation%20Singapore%20scandal\"&gt;National Kidney Foundation (NKF) scandal&lt;/a&gt;, and made &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Ee\"&gt;Gerard Ee&lt;/a&gt; the new Chairman of the NKF following the resignation of &lt;a href=\"T.%20T.%20Durai\"&gt;T. T. Durai&lt;/a&gt;. Responding to a report by international auditing firm &lt;a href=\"KPMG\"&gt;KPMG&lt;/a&gt; in Parliament in December 2005, Khaw vowed to punish all wrongdoers in the saga and heavily criticised NKF's \"bizarre HR policies\".\nIn a parliamentary speech on 9 February 2009, in the context of tackling the rising healthcare costs, Khaw suggested that Singaporeans can consider sending their elderly parents to nursing homes in &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Bahru\"&gt;Johor Bahru&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href=\"developing%20country\"&gt;developing country&lt;/a&gt; located close to &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. This was quoted by news reports and a public outcry ensued. Khaw subsequently clarified that his statement was quoted out of context by the media and his suggestion was only one of the many choices available to Singaporeans.\nIn 2010, Khaw wrote on his blog explaining that his heart bypass surgery had only cost him a mere $8 (&lt;a href=\"Singapore%20dollar\"&gt;SGD&lt;/a&gt;) in cash in a class A ward, as the rest of the cost was offset by payments combined from his universal &lt;a href=\"Healthcare%20in%20Singapore\"&gt;Medishield&lt;/a&gt; account and private insurance. This sparked off a debate in the public sphere, with many questioning if an ordinary Singaporean had the means to pay for such high insurance premiums as he did in the first place. Members of the pro-PAP group, Silent No More, defended Khaw's claim and encouraged one another to rebut Internet users who had made jibes at Khaw.\nMinister for National Development (2011 - 2015).\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Singaporean%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 general election&lt;/a&gt; where the ruling PAP garnered its lowest vote share of 60.1% since independence, Khaw was appointed the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20National%20Development%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Minister for National Development&lt;/a&gt;. At a press conference, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hsien%20Loong\"&gt;Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Khaw had volunteered for this new role as the public was extremely unhappy with the Government's &lt;a href=\"Public%20housing%20in%20Singapore\"&gt;housing policy&lt;/a&gt;, and Khaw felt that he had the ability to solve the problem. In his new appointment, Khaw assured the public that he will make housing affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans. In his 2013 budget debate, he said:\n\u201cWe can now pause and see what else we can do to bring Build-to-Order (BTO) prices in non-mature estates to, say, around four years of salary as it was before the current property cycle started.\u201d\nThough the relative prices of &lt;a href=\"Build%20to%20order%20%28HDB%29\"&gt;Build To Order&lt;/a&gt; (BTO) flats have fallen since Khaw's speech, most of the flats still cost more than four years of an applicant's salary. The prices of new flats remain high despite six rounds of cooling measures. In January 2013, a seventh round of property cooling measures was introduced to moderate the increase in residential and industrial prices.\nIn July 2012, &lt;a href=\"National%20Parks%20Board\"&gt;National Parks Board&lt;/a&gt;'s (NParks) purchase of 26 &lt;a href=\"Brompton%20Bicycle\"&gt;Brompton bikes&lt;/a&gt; costing $2,200 each sparked a nationwide uproar after it was revealed by a whistleblower on online forum &lt;a href=\"HardwareZone\"&gt;HardwareZone&lt;/a&gt; of possible corruption due numerous red flags in the way the procurement was done. Khaw, who initially defended NPark's purchase of the high-end foldable bikes, was criticised for handling the saga poorly. Subsequent investigation by the &lt;a href=\"Corrupt%20Practices%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau&lt;/a&gt; resulted in National Parks Board assistant director Bernard Lim Yong Soon being fined $5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with the bicycle firm which was awarded the tender.\nHe also led the initiative to encourage cycling in the city state, such as through transforming the &lt;a href=\"Park%20Connector%20Network\"&gt;Park Connector Network&lt;/a&gt; for use by people on bikes as well as walking.\nDuring a parliamentary session on 12 February 2015, Khaw spoke on the Auditor-General's findings on the opposition-run &lt;a href=\"Aljunied%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Aljunied\u2013Hougang-Punggol East Town Council&lt;/a&gt;'s alleged financial irregularities.\nIf an auditor makes such a finding on a listed company, it will immediately cause consternation among the shareholders, and a call for the removal of the CEO and the Board of Directors. In Japan, the Chairman and CEO would hold a press conference and take a deep bow. And in the good old days, they may even commit \"harakiri\".\nThe quote on committing &lt;a href=\"seppuku\"&gt;seppuku&lt;/a&gt; (harakiri) when top leaders make mistakes became part of Singapore\u2019s political lexicon as various irregularities and lapses of other government agencies started surfacing, along with the persistent train breakdowns under Khaw's Transportation portfolio in later years.\nKhaw came under fire in 2015 when it was revealed that a site in &lt;a href=\"Sengkang\"&gt;Sengkang&lt;/a&gt; designated for religious use was awarded to a commercial company to develop a &lt;a href=\"columbarium\"&gt;columbarium&lt;/a&gt; instead. Residents of an upcoming BTO public housing project in the vicinity demanded a refund as they did not know they would have to live next to a columbarium. Responding to opposition MP &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Li%20Lian\"&gt;Lee Li Lian&lt;/a&gt;'s questions in Parliament, Khaw acknowledged the oversight and used the &lt;a href=\"Butterfly%20Lovers\"&gt;Butterfly Lovers&lt;/a&gt; analogy to explain how \"tender procedures have not caught up with time ... the (HDB) officers assessing the tender just assumed that it must be a company affiliated to some religious organisation\". The columbarium plan was eventually aborted.\nMinister for Transport (2015 - 2020).\nOn 28 September 2015, it was announced that Khaw will be the Co-ordinating Minister for Infrastructure as well as the Minister for Transport from 1 October 2015, taking over a portfolio that has been under heavy public scrutiny. Khaw wrote on his blog that he did not volunteer for the \"thankless\" job, but accepted it nevertheless as he put the nation's interest above his own. A key tenet of Khaw's transport policy is his vision of transforming Singapore into a &lt;a href=\"Car-free%20movement\"&gt;car-lite&lt;/a&gt; city by 2030, which includes building a \"smarter, greener and more inclusive transport system\". He has stated publicly that 75% of trips should be made by public transport by 2030. Khaw has also advocated for the use of driverless buses to tackle the manpower crunch. Three towns in Singapore will introduce these new vehicles by 2022.\nKhaw has had several run-ins with both the state and independent media. In one notable incident on 27 July 2017 at a forum on infrastructure management, Khaw stated that train reliability has improved three times since he took over. He was subsequently criticised online by commuters who had experienced persistent breakdowns in the same period. Khaw had derived his statistics based on preliminary data excluding all delays caused by re-signalling works. Khaw further berated the &lt;a href=\"Media%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Singapore press&lt;/a&gt; for reporting extensively on the MRT breakdowns, criticizing them for \"turning tabloid\", \"publishing frightening figures\", and magnifying the problem to which he has no solution. He added that if solving the problem was as simple as \"holding a pen and writing a few articles\",\nmembers of the media should run the transport system instead and Singapore does not need any engineers.\nAs Minister of Transport, Khaw had indicated in March 2017 that public transportation fares were set to increase and a fare review will be conducted by the Public Transport Council (PTC). Rationalizing the move, Khaw said that operating costs have been increasing, rendering the current fare structure \"unsustainable\" despite subsidies from the government. He further stressed the need to strike a \"fair balance\" in the proportion of transport costs between commuters, the government and the transport operators. His comments were subsequently met with discontent among the public, with many questioning if transport fare increases have been tied to service improvements, and whether there is a need for a fare hike when the transport operators have been generating profitable growth. On 7 March 2018, Khaw pushed for a review of the current fare formula and transfers. However, fares will be reviewed depending on the economic and market conditions. Currently, the \"bus service must not be the same as the preceding bus service\" is abolished and became a transfer.\nFactWire expos\u00e9 on defective trains.\nOn 5 July 2016, Hong Kong based investigative news agency, &lt;a href=\"FactWire\"&gt;FactWire&lt;/a&gt; broke news about 35 SMRT trains being secretively shipped back to China for repair by manufacturer CSR Sifang Locomotive &amp; Rolling Stock Company Ltd. It was reported that cracks were found in the structure connecting the car body and the bogie. After remaining silent for a week, Khaw came out to explain that the cracks were not safety issues and that the news could result in \u201cundue panic\u201d during a briefing at the &lt;a href=\"Bishan%20Depot\"&gt;Bishan Depot&lt;/a&gt;. He criticised the news agency for mischief and even suggested that Singapore is a victim caught in the rivalry between political factions in Hong Kong and China.\nFactWire noted that instead of taking responsibility for an incident which has damaged the Singaporean public\u2019s trust in the authorities, Khaw chose to blame the news agency for exposing the cover up. FactWire defended its reporting and denied allegations of political interference. In an open letter to Khaw on 14 July, the agency maintained that it is funded by the Hong Kong public and that its reporting is independent of commercial or political considerations.\nBishan MRT tunnel flooding.\nOn the evening of 7 October 2017, the tunnels along the North South MRT line (NSL) were flooded as a result of a malfunctioned pump, causing a 20 hours disruption. Khaw addressed the media 9 days later, holding the SMRT maintenance team responsible for failing Singaporeans. On 19 October 2017, the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Singapore Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; issued a strongly worded statement calling for Khaw to step down as Minister of Transport. In the letter, the party charged that Khaw has failed to stop the recurring breakdowns and other serious lapses all these years, signalling his incompetence and lack of leadership. It said, rather than shifting the blame to everyone else, as the Minister for Transport, he must take responsibility for the ongoing fiasco and resign.\nResponding to mounting public pressure, Khaw delivered a 47-minute Ministerial Statement in Parliament on 7 November 2017. The parliamentary sitting was attended by SMRT's senior management, which included CEO &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Kuek\"&gt;Desmond Kuek&lt;/a&gt; and Chairman Seah Moon Ming. In his speech, Khaw revealed that anti-flooding pumps at &lt;a href=\"Lavender%20MRT%20station\"&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kembangan%20MRT%20station\"&gt;Kembangan&lt;/a&gt; stations were also found to be in non-serviceable condition, and maintenance records might have been falsified since 2016. Khaw disagreed with opposition chief &lt;a href=\"Low%20Thia%20Khiang\"&gt;Low Thia Khiang&lt;/a&gt;'s charge that SMRT's main aim is to \"make money for the government\" at the expense of commuters, saying that \"there are many other simpler ways to make money\".\nKhaw declined any shortcomings or lapses in regulatory oversight by LTA or MOT staff and dismissed proposals to form a committee of inquiry. A poll conducted by market research company Blackbox, however, showed that 69% of Singaporeans felt a public inquiry into the incident should have been held. In the same poll, more than half of Singaporeans felt SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek should resign. Defending Kuek's performance, Khaw said, \"he wasn\u2019t parachuted in or being asked to go and fix this, he volunteered for this job. As the former Chief of Defence Force, I know his heart is in the right place\". However, members of the public questioned Khaw's choice of the word \"volunteer\" given that Kuek is paid $1.87 million per annum, and whether there is a proper selection process at SMRT given that Kuek, a former &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Singapore Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; Lieutenant-General and civil servant, had no experience running a company in engineering or rail operations before joining SMRT.\nSpeaking at the inaugural Public Transport Workers Appreciation Day on 14 November 2017, Khaw further criticised SMRT's maintenance team responsible for the tunnel flooding, saying that they had \"tarnished the reputation of Singapore and Singaporeans\", and \"brought disrepute\" to other transport workers. The saga led to the sacking of 8 SMRT employees and legal action is expected to commence.\nJoo Koon rail accident.\nAn MRT train collided with another at &lt;a href=\"Joo%20Koon%20MRT%20station\"&gt;Joo Koon station&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 0818 hours (SST) on 15 November 2017. It was initially reported that the accident caused 28 people to sustain injuries and they were taken to &lt;a href=\"Ng%20Teng%20Fong%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Ng Teng Fong General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20Hospital\"&gt;National University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 28 injured, 2 were SMRT staff (including the driver) and 3 had to remain warded in hospital for observation. The collision caused massive delays on the &lt;a href=\"East%20West%20MRT%20Line\"&gt;East West MRT Line&lt;/a&gt;. More commuters sought treatment thereafter, which saw the number of injured rising to 38.\nSpeaking to the media hours after the accident occurred, Khaw said he was \"deeply sorry\" and it was \"an awful day\". It was revealed at a press conference that the collision occurred due to an \"inadvertent removal\" of a signalling software protection feature. Train services between Joo Koon and &lt;a href=\"Tuas%20Link%20MRT%20station\"&gt;Tuas Link station&lt;/a&gt; had to be suspended for four days to allow signaling contractor &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; to conduct further assurance checks. The last train collision occurred over 2 decades ago in 1993 which resulted in 156 injured.\nAccording to a statement from SMRT and LTA, the protective \"bubble\" around the first train was \"unexpectedly disabled\" when it passed a trackside device, which was not compatible with the new signalling system. The second train failed to keep safe distances from the first train as it moved forward automatically. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on 21 November, Khaw said that Thales, the provider of the new signalling system, \"could have done better\" to avoid the Joo Koon collision. Khaw asserts that if one disregards the collision and the flooding incident, SMRT was \"actually making good progress\" with regards to train operation.\nOther appointments.\nKhaw was a &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; since 2001 where his first represented &lt;a href=\"Tanjong%20Pagar%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency&lt;/a&gt; (Tanjong Pagar GRC) from 2001, before transferring to &lt;a href=\"Sembawang%20Group%20Representation%20Constituency\"&gt;Sembawang GRC&lt;/a&gt; to succeed outgoing minister and MP &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Tan%20Keng%20Yam\"&gt;Tony Tan&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, who later served as Singapore's 7th President from 2011 to 2017.\nIn 2011, Khaw took over outgoing minister &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Boon%20Heng\"&gt;Lim Boon Heng&lt;/a&gt; as the party's chairman, and in 2018 his role was taken over by Health Minister &lt;a href=\"Gan%20Kim%20Yong\"&gt;Gan Kim Yong&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2015, Khaw was also appointed as the Co-ordinating Minister for Infrastructure by the prime minister.\nDuring an interview on 26 June 2020, Khaw stated that he will be retiring from politics at the July 2020 general election, after 19 years of service.\nEducation.\nKhaw attended and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Ling%20High%20School\"&gt;Chung Ling High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1973, he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Plan\"&gt;Colombo Plan&lt;/a&gt; scholarship from Singaporean &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Singapore%29\"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; to study a &lt;a href=\"Double%20degree\"&gt;combined degree&lt;/a&gt; program in &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"commerce\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Newcastle%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;University of Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in 1977 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;Bachelor of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (Honours Class I) and &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;Bachelor of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe received his Master of Science degree in &lt;a href=\"industrial%20engineering\"&gt;industrial engineering&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 from the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;National University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and received his &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;Doctor of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; \"honoris causa\" from the University of Newcastle in 2002.\nPersonal life.\nKhaw is of &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese\"&gt;Malaysian Chinese&lt;/a&gt; descent. He is a Buddhist and a self-professed \"religious man\". In 2010, Khaw underwent a heart bypass operation and after his recovery, it was reported that he had switched to a &lt;a href=\"vegan\"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; diet, avoiding all meat, fish and dairy products. In March 2019, Khaw underwent an arm operation for a fracture that took place a month earlier. During this period, Dr &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Balakrishnan\"&gt;Vivian Balakrishnan&lt;/a&gt; took over the role as Acting Transport Minister. On 23 July 2020, Khaw Boon Wan was diagnosed with dengue fever after a sudden rise in temperature, his third time and was subsequently discharged two days later.\nKhaw is also known to the public for his strikingly similar looks to Singaporean actor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Thia\"&gt;Henry Thia&lt;/a&gt;, a fact Thia often acknowledges by jokingly referring to Khaw as his twin."
