    "text": "M\u00fcller is a German company producing a variety of &lt;a href=\"dairy%20products\"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt;, with headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Fischach\"&gt;Fischach&lt;/a&gt; in the German state of &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from its German home market, M\u00fcller is also active on various markets around Europe and beyond. It is, for example, one of the best selling yogurt brands in the United Kingdom. \nThe company achieved a turnover of &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;5.7 billion in 2019 and has more than 27,500 employees.\nHistory.\nThe M\u00fcller company was founded in 1896 in Aretsried, Bavaria. In 1971, the founder's grandson &lt;a href=\"Theo%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Theo M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt; took over as the sole owner.\nThrough a &lt;a href=\"joint%20venture\"&gt;joint venture&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"PepsiCo\"&gt;PepsiCo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Quaker%20Oats%20Company\"&gt;Quaker Foods&lt;/a&gt; division, M\u00fcller entered the market in the United States in August 2012. The company's plant in the United States opened in &lt;a href=\"Batavia%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Batavia, New York&lt;/a&gt;, in June 2013, and was the distribution hub for the United States. However, the company announced in December 2015 that it would close the plant. The plant reopened in July 2017, under new ownership by \"Alpina Foods\", but closed down again in January 2019.\nOperations.\nThe M\u00fcller group is one of the largest dairy groups in the world, with an estimated turnover in the dairy sector of around \u20ac3.3 billion (2013). In total, the group generates annual sales of around \u20ac5.7 billion (2019) and employs around 27,500 people worldwide (2019).\nDairy brands.\nThe group includes a number of companies operating under the M\u00fcller name, including the original Molkerei Alois M\u00fcller GmbH &amp; Co. KG and M\u00fcller Dairy (U.K.). It is best known for its range of &lt;a href=\"yogurt\"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;s, including the trademark 'M\u00fcller Corner', and fresh milk based drinks.\nThe group includes subsidiaries with independent brands such as M\u00fcller, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCller%20Milk%20%26amp%3B%20Ingredients\"&gt;M\u00fcller Wiseman&lt;/a&gt;, M\u00fcller Quaker Dairy, Weihenstephan, Sachsenmilch and K\u00e4serei Loose. Private labels and basic dairy products such as &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UHT%20milk\"&gt;UHT milk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lactose\"&gt;lactose&lt;/a&gt; powder and &lt;a href=\"whey%20protein\"&gt;whey protein&lt;/a&gt; complete the portfolio.\nIn addition to the companies operating under the M\u00fcller name, the group wholly or partly owns the Molkerei Weihenstephan, Sachsenmilch and K\u00e4serei Loose dairy companies in Germany, the Ml\u00e9k\u00e1rna Pragolaktos dairy in the Czech Republic, and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCller%20Milk%20%26amp%3B%20Ingredients\"&gt;M\u00fcller Milk &amp; Ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. \nConvenience foods.\nSince 2011, the group has also included \"HK Food\", which is one of Germany's leading manufacturers of convenience foods. Its product range includes chilled delicatessen salads, sauces and fish specialities from the \"Homann\", \"Nadler\", \"Livio\" and other brands of the Homann Group. The branch business from &lt;a href=\"Nordsee\"&gt;Nordsee&lt;/a&gt; was part of HK Food until October 2018.\nProduction sites.\nIn Germany, beside the group headquarters in Fischach which also houses the Molkerei Alois M\u00fcller production plant, the group also operates significant production sites in &lt;a href=\"Freising\"&gt;Freising&lt;/a&gt; (Molkerei Weihenstephan), Leppersdorf (Sachsenmilch and K\u00e4serei Loose), &lt;a href=\"Market%20Drayton\"&gt;Market Drayton&lt;/a&gt; (M\u00fcller Dairy (U.K.)), and &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; (Ml\u00e9k\u00e1rna Pragolaktos).\nThe group had twenty five production sites worldwide by February 2017.\nSales offices and exports.\nThe company has sales offices in Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia and Hong Kong. M\u00fcller also exports fresh dairy products of the M\u00fcller brand to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland, Croatia, Luxembourg, Austria, Russia, Slovenia, Hungary and the United Arab Emirates.\nSupport services.\nIn addition to the milk processing subsidiaries, a number of ancillary marketing and transport companies are also owned. The group includes the packaging company Optipack, the company owned logistics company &lt;a href=\"Culina%20Group\"&gt;Culina Group&lt;/a&gt; and M\u00fcller Naturfarm.\nProduct ranges.\nM\u00fcller produces a substantial number of popular yogurt brands, including M\u00fcllerlight, M\u00fcllerice, Yogz and M\u00fcller Corner.\nMarketing and advertising.\nIn December 2004, M\u00fcller released a new set of adverts using the song by Nina Simone, \"&lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20Got%20No%2C%20I%20Got%20Life\"&gt;Ain't Got No, I Got Life&lt;/a&gt;\", although it focussed only on the \"I Got Life\" half of the song. In 2008, they introduced a new advert featuring their factory based in &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt;, and emphasising the closeness of supply from the surrounding area of its factory in &lt;a href=\"Market%20Drayton\"&gt;Market Drayton&lt;/a&gt;; \"24 hours from farm to yogurt\". M\u00fcller would eventually be ridiculed for using \"&lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20Got%20No%2C%20I%20Got%20Life\"&gt;Ain't Got No, I Got Life&lt;/a&gt;\" in a parody of their 2008 commercial which edited the advert together with footage of the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20campaign\"&gt;1963 race riots in Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and this time using the \"Ain't Got No\" half of the tune. In October 2011, M\u00fcller launched a new slogan, \"W\u00fcnderful Stuff\".\nThis was backed by a new advertising campaign involving people being turned into various cartoon characters, which first aired on 8 October on &lt;a href=\"ITV1\"&gt;ITV1&lt;/a&gt;, during that night's edition of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29\"&gt;The X Factor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nM\u00fcller was the main shirt sponsor for English &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; as part of a two year deal from 1993 until 1995, during which time they won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The sponsorship ended when the club accepted a sponsorship offer from &lt;a href=\"AST%20Research\"&gt;AST Research&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2013, the American singer &lt;a href=\"Nicole%20Scherzinger\"&gt;Nicole Scherzinger&lt;/a&gt; has appeared in M\u00fcller adverts."
