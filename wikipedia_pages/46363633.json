    "text": "Myanmar\u2013Taiwan relations refers to the &lt;a href=\"international%20relations\"&gt;international relations&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. There are no official relations between the two countries, as Myanmar only recognizes the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1949, following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; soldiers fled and took a stronghold in Northern &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; with support from the US. With support from the PRC, Myanmar accused the Republic of China of \"invading\" Myanmar, and issued an appeal to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. After many negotiations, all Kuomintang soldiers in Myanmar were sent to Northern Thailand. Kuomintang soldiers helped Thailand fight &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; rebels, and prevented a left revolution in Thailand, which led to the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Thailand\"&gt;King of Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhumibol%20Adulyadej\"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt;, giving Kuomintang soldiers special amnesty for entitlement in Thailand, whilst some left for &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiplomatic representation.\nIn the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Myanmar has a mission in &lt;a href=\"Taipei\"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Myanmar%20Trade%20Office%2C%20the%20Republic%20of%20the%20Union%20of%20Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar Trade Office, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;. Operated by the country's &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Commerce%20%28Myanmar%29\"&gt;Ministry of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;, this was established in June 2015. Taiwan currently has no mission in &lt;a href=\"Naypyidaw\"&gt;Naypyidaw&lt;/a&gt;, with Myanmar affairs being handled by the &lt;a href=\"Taipei%20Economic%20and%20Cultural%20Office%20in%20Thailand\"&gt;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Taiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council\"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; established a trade mission in &lt;a href=\"Yangon\"&gt;Yangon&lt;/a&gt; in November 2013.\nEconomic.\nAgriculture.\nTaiwan-based \"Known-You Seed Corporation\" established in 1968, moved into the Myanmar market in 1994. In 1996, it began to cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Irrigation of Myanmar, which founded an agricultural school in Irrawaddy. The most frequently imported product is &lt;a href=\"watermelon\"&gt;watermelon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransportation.\n&lt;a href=\"China%20Airlines\"&gt;China Airlines&lt;/a&gt; offers flights from &lt;a href=\"Taiwan%20Taoyuan%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Yangon%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Yangon International Airport&lt;/a&gt;."
