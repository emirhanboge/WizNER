    "text": " (; also &lt;a href=\"transliteration\"&gt;transliterated&lt;/a&gt; ) is a &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; term literally meaning \"beautiful youth (boy)\" and describes an &lt;a href=\"aesthetic\"&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt; that can be found in disparate areas in &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt;: a young man of &lt;a href=\"androgyny\"&gt;androgynous&lt;/a&gt; beauty. This word originated from the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt; poem \"&lt;a href=\"Eight%20Immortals%20of%20the%20Wine%20Cup\"&gt;Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Du%20Fu\"&gt;Du Fu&lt;/a&gt;. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20popular%20culture\"&gt;Japanese pop culture&lt;/a&gt;, gaining in popularity due to the androgynous &lt;a href=\"glam%20rock\"&gt;glam rock&lt;/a&gt; bands of the 1970s, but it has roots in ancient &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20literature\"&gt;Japanese literature&lt;/a&gt;, the androsocial and androerotic ideals of the medieval &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; imperial court and intellectuals, and &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n aesthetic concepts carried over from &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, imported with &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; to China. Today, are very popular among girls and women in Japan. Reasons for this social phenomenon may include the unique male and female social relationships found within the genre. Some have theorized that provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down &lt;a href=\"stereotype\"&gt;stereotype&lt;/a&gt;s surrounding &lt;a href=\"feminine%20male\"&gt;feminine male&lt;/a&gt; characters. These are often depicted with very strong &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt; abilities, sports talent, high intelligence, &lt;a href=\"dandy\"&gt;dandy&lt;/a&gt; fashion, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/&lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nThe prefix \"bi\" (&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%E7%BE%8E\"&gt;\u7f8e&lt;/a&gt;) more often than not refers to feminine beauty, and \"&lt;a href=\"bijinga\"&gt;bijin&lt;/a&gt;\", literally \"beautiful person\", is usually, though not always, used to refer to beautiful women. means \"beautiful middle-aged man\". \"Biseinen\" is to be distinguished from \"bish\u014dnen\" as is used to describe men who are of age, including those who have entered or completed tertiary education. The term \"sh\u014dnen\" is used to describe boys of middle and high school age. Last, \"bishota\" can be used to refer to a beautiful, &lt;a href=\"pre-pubescent\"&gt;pre-pubescent&lt;/a&gt; male child or a childlike male. Outside Japan, \"bish\u014dnen\" is the most well-known of the three terms, and has become a generic term for all beautiful boys and young men.\nThe aesthetic of the \"bish\u014dnen\" began as an ideal of a young lover, originally embodied in the , or adolescent boy, and was influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Oyama%20%28Japanese%20theatre%29\"&gt;effeminate male actors&lt;/a&gt; who played female characters in &lt;a href=\"kabuki\"&gt;kabuki theater&lt;/a&gt;. The term arose in the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20era\"&gt;Meiji era&lt;/a&gt;, in part to replace the by then obsolete erotic meaning of the older term \"wakash\u016b\", whose general meaning of \"adolescent boy\" had by this point been supplanted by the new term &lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Dnen\"&gt;sh\u014dnen&lt;/a&gt;. The \"bish\u014dnen\" was conceived of as \"aesthetically different from both women and men [...] both the antithesis and the antecedent of adult masculinity\".\nThe \"bish\u014dnen\" is typically slender, with clear skin, stylish hair, and distinctly feminine facial features (such as high cheekbones), but simultaneously retains a male body. This androgynous appearance is akin to the depiction of &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; in Western &lt;a href=\"renaissance%20art\"&gt;renaissance art&lt;/a&gt;, with similar social roots for this aesthetic.\n&lt;a href=\"Minamoto%20no%20Yoshitsune\"&gt;Minamoto no Yoshitsune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amakusa%20Shir%C5%8D\"&gt;Amakusa Shir\u014d&lt;/a&gt; have been identified as historical \"bish\u014dnen\". &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Buruma\"&gt;Ian Buruma&lt;/a&gt; notes that Yoshitsune was considered by contemporaries to be not physically prepossessing, but that his legend later grew and due to this, he became depicted with good looks. &lt;a href=\"Abe%20no%20Seimei\"&gt;Abe no Seimei&lt;/a&gt; was depicted according to the standards of a Heian-era middle-aged man, but since 1989 he has been depicted as a modern-style \"bish\u014dnen\".\n&lt;a href=\"Kyokutei%20Bakin\"&gt;Kyokutei Bakin&lt;/a&gt; wrote many works with \"&lt;a href=\"nanshoku\"&gt;nanshoku&lt;/a&gt;\" undertones featuring \"bish\u014dnen\" characters, and in 1848 he used the term \"bish\u014dnen\" in the title of a work about the younger \"wakashu\" partner in the \"nanshoku\" relationship.\nThe \"bish\u014dnen\" aesthetic is continued today in &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt;, especially \"&lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Djo%20manga\"&gt;sh\u014djo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"yaoi\"&gt;yaoi&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUsage.\nSome non-Japanese, especially American, &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; fans use the term to refer to any handsome male character regardless of age, or any homosexual character. In the original Japanese, however, \"bish\u014dnen\" applies only to boys under 18. For those older, the word is used. In the place of \"bish\u014dnen\", some fans prefer to use the slightly more sexually neutral or the Anglicized slang term \"bishie\" (also spelled \"bishi\"), but these terms remain less common. The term \"binanshi\" was popular in the 1980s. \"Bish\u014dnen\" is occasionally used to describe some androgynous female characters, such as Takarazuka actors, &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Jarjayes\"&gt;Lady Oscar&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rose%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;The Rose of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;\", or any women with traits stereotypical to \"bish\u014dnen\".\nScottish pop singer &lt;a href=\"Momus%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Momus&lt;/a&gt; notably used the term in his song \"Bishonen\" from the \"&lt;a href=\"Tender%20Pervert\"&gt;Tender Pervert&lt;/a&gt;\" album (released on Creation Records). Almost 8 minutes long, the song is an epic tale of a young boy raised to die young by an eccentric stepfather.\nPopular culture.\nThe enduring preference for \"bish\u014dnen\" males can clearly be seen in Japan and throughout parts of &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt; to this day.\nIn particular, Japan's largest male talent agency, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20%26amp%3B%20Associates\"&gt;Johnny &amp; Associates&lt;/a&gt; Entertainment Company, specializes only in producing male &lt;a href=\"Tarento\"&gt;Tarento idols&lt;/a&gt;. Accepted into Johnny &amp; Associates in their early teens, these boys, collectively known as 'Johnnys', are trained and promoted to become the next leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations. Almost all can be classified as \"bish\u014dnen\", exhibiting the same physically &lt;a href=\"Femininity\"&gt;feminine&lt;/a&gt; features combined with a sometimes deliberately &lt;a href=\"ambivalence\"&gt;ambivalent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexuality&lt;/a&gt; or at the very least, a lack of any hint of a relationship to maintain their popular availability.\nCurrent \"bish\u014dnen\" examples from the same agency include &lt;a href=\"Tomohisa%20Yamashita\"&gt;Tomohisa Yamashita&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"J-pop\"&gt;J-pop&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"News%20%28band%29\"&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Akanishi\"&gt;Jin Akanishi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazuya%20Kamenashi\"&gt;Kazuya Kamenashi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"KAT-TUN\"&gt;KAT-TUN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Takuya%20Kimura\"&gt;Takuya Kimura&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"SMAP\"&gt;SMAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryosuke%20Yamada\"&gt;Ryosuke Yamada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kei%20Inoo\"&gt;Kei Inoo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hey%21%20Say%21%20JUMP\"&gt;Hey! Say! JUMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jun%20Matsumoto\"&gt;Jun Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arashi\"&gt;Arashi&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom are phenomenally successful throughout East Asia by appealing to both younger and older women and whose widely praised, gender-incongruous physical beauty is often deliberately manipulated in terms of &lt;a href=\"role-playing\"&gt;role-playing&lt;/a&gt; and, most commonly, &lt;a href=\"fanservice\"&gt;fanservice&lt;/a&gt;.\nArt.\nBesides being a character type, \"bish\u014dnen\" is also a distinct art style not usually forgotten in books about drawing &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt;. In art, \"bish\u014dnen\" are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face. The character's \"sex appeal\" is highlighted through introducing the character by using an \"eroticized\" full page spread. Characters with \"bulging muscles\" are rarely considered \"bish\u014dnen\", as they are too masculine.\nIt is said that &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rn%20Andr%C3%A9sen\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen&lt;/a&gt;'s appearance as Tadzio in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20in%20Venice%20%28film%29\"&gt;Death in Venice&lt;/a&gt;\" inspired many Japanese anime artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Keiko%20Takemiya\"&gt;Keiko Takemiya&lt;/a&gt;, who became known for their depictions of young, effeminate men.\nBish\u014dnen characters are fairly common in sh\u014djo manga and &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the male characters show subtle signs of the \"bish\u014dnen\" style, such as slender eyes or a &lt;a href=\"Femininity\"&gt;feminine&lt;/a&gt; face.\nSome manga are completely drawn in the \"bish\u014dnen\" style, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya\"&gt;Saint Seiya&lt;/a&gt;\". \"bish\u014dnen\" manga are generally &lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Djo%20manga\"&gt;sh\u014djo manga&lt;/a&gt; (girls' comics) or &lt;a href=\"yaoi\"&gt;yaoi&lt;/a&gt; (girls' comics focused on &lt;a href=\"Homosexuality\"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; relationships between beautiful boys), however &lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga\"&gt;sh\u014dnen manga&lt;/a&gt; (boy's comics) may use casts of \"bish\u014dnen\" characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, with some degree of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted constant reminder of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant \"bish\u014dnen\" in the role of the recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.\n\"Bish\u014dnen\" and \"bish\u014djo\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Bish%C5%8Djo\"&gt;Bish\u014djo&lt;/a&gt;\" ('beautiful girl') is often mistakenly considered a parallel of \"bish\u014dnen\", because of the similar construction of the terms. There are major differences between the two aesthetics. The \"bish\u014djo\" aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in a cute, pretty style; \"bish\u014dnen\" is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common mistake is assuming that the female characters in \"bish\u014dnen\" manga and anime are \"bish\u014djo\". In truth, female characters in \"bish\u014dnen\" manga are very different from those in \"bish\u014djo\"; \"bish\u014djo\" females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas \"bish\u014dnen\" females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the \"bish\u014dnen\" themselves.\nCritical attention.\nSeveral cultural anthropologists and authors have raised the multifaceted aspect of what \"bish\u014dnen\" represents and what it is interpreted as, mostly to fit a particular external viewpoint. &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Buruma\"&gt;Ian Buruma&lt;/a&gt; noted that although Western comics for girls also included \"impossibly beautiful men\" who are clearly masculine and always get the girl in the end, the \"bish\u014dnen\" are \"more ambivalent\" and sometimes get each other.\nFor Sandra Buckley, \"bish\u014dnen\" narratives champion \"the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations\" James Welker describes the \"bish\u014dnen\" as being \"&lt;a href=\"queer\"&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;\", as the \"bish\u014dnen\" is an androgynous &lt;a href=\"aesthete\"&gt;aesthete&lt;/a&gt; with a feminine soul \"who lives and loves outside of the heteropatriarchal world\".\nJonathan D. Mackintosh believes that the \"bish\u014dnen\" is a \"traditional representation of youth\", being \"interstitial\" between both childhood and adulthood and between being male and being female, regardless of the sexual issues.\nIshida Hitoshi makes the case that the image of the \"bish\u014dnen\" is more about a grounding in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 1960s, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.\nRepresentations of men in manga by and for men show \"an idealized man being ultramasculine and phallic\", \"bish\u014dnen\" are conversely drawn to \"emphasize their beauty and sensuality\", and female artists have been said to react against the ultramasculine representation by showing androgynous and \"aesthetically beautiful\" men.\nIan Buruma, writing in 1984, considered the \"bishonen in distress\" to be a recurring motif in popular manga. The \"bish\u014dnen\" in distress is always rescued by an older, protective, mentor. This scenario has an \"unmistakably homoerotic\" atmosphere. He also notes that \"bish\u014dnen\" must either grow up, or die beautifully. He considers the \"worship\" of the \"bish\u014dnen\" to be the same as that of the &lt;a href=\"cherry%20blossom\"&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt;, and notes that \"death is the only pure and thus fitting end to the perfection of youth.\""
