    "text": "The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico () is the &lt;a href=\"state%20legislature%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;territorial legislature&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the &lt;a href=\"legislative%20branch%20of%20the%20government%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. The Assembly is a &lt;a href=\"bicameral\"&gt;bicameral&lt;/a&gt; legislature consisting of an &lt;a href=\"upper%20house\"&gt;upper house&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish: \"Senado\") normally composed of 27 senators, and the &lt;a href=\"lower%20house\"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish: \"C\u00e1mara de Representantes\") normally consisting of 51 representatives. Eleven members of each house are elected &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; rather than from a specific legislative district with all members being elected for a four-year term without &lt;a href=\"term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;term limits&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe structure and responsibilities of the Legislative Assembly are defined in Article III of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Constitution of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; which vests all legislative power in the Legislative Assembly. Every &lt;a href=\"bill%20%28law%29\"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; must be passed by both houses and signed by the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Governor of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; to become law. Each house has its unique powers. The constitution also states that each house shall be the unique judge on the legal capacity of its members. The constitution also grants &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20immunity\"&gt;parliamentary immunity&lt;/a&gt; to all elected members of the Legislative Assembly.\nThe assembly currently in session is the 18th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, composed of the &lt;a href=\"26th%20Senate%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;26th Senate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"30th%20House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;30th House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Legislative Assembly convenes at the &lt;a href=\"Capitol%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Capitol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe House of Representatives is the oldest legislative body in Puerto Rico. It was formed on November 25, 1897, when the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20government\"&gt;Spanish government&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%A1xedes%20Mateo%20Sagasta\"&gt;Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta&lt;/a&gt; granted autonomy to the archipelago, creating a House that was composed of 32 members. Beside the House there was also an Administrative Council of 15 members, eight of whom were elected by a \"Colegio de Compromisarios\" and the other seven were named by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Governor General&lt;/a&gt; in representation of the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish monarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States on July 25, 1898 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, a military government took over the archipelago. This was until April 12, 1900 when the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; approved the first civil government for Puerto Rico under the federal &lt;a href=\"Foraker%20Act\"&gt;Foraker Act&lt;/a&gt;. The act granted the archipelago with a civil governor (named by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20President\"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt;) and a House of Delegates composed of 35 members elected by the people of Puerto Rico, as well as an Executive Council of 11 members, designated all by the U.S. President, and six sitting members consisting of the governor's &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe political arrangement under the Foraker Act continued until 1917. On March 2 of that year, president &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; approved the &lt;a href=\"Jones%E2%80%93Shafroth%20Act\"&gt;Jones\u2013Shafroth Act&lt;/a&gt;, which provided for the creation of an independent &lt;a href=\"legislative%20branch\"&gt;legislative branch&lt;/a&gt; for Puerto Rico, establishing a House of Representatives with 39 members and a Senate of 19 members, all elected directly by the people of the unincorporated territory. Puerto Rico was then divided into 7 senatorial districts and 35 house districts. The &lt;a href=\"first%20Senate%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;first Senate of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; was elected in July 1917.\nThe unincorporated territory is divided into 8 senatorial and 40 House districts. On July 25, 1952, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted, establishing the current House of Representantes and Senate as the bicameral houses of the Legislative Assembly (as stated in Article III).\nPowers.\nThe Constitution of Puerto Rico vests all legislative powers in the Legislative Assembly. Each house has the sole power to be the judge of the legal capacities of its members. The members of both houses are protected by parliamentary immunity, which Article III, Section 14 states \"no member of the Legislative Assembly shall be imprisoned...\", they also shall not be held accountable for anything said in the floor.\nEach House holds exclusive powers that are not given to the other. The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate an &lt;a href=\"impeachment\"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; process and the Senate the exclusive power to pass judgement. All laws dealing with the commonwealth budget or taxes must originate in the House of Representatives. The Senate retains the exclusive power to extend its consent to appointments to government offices made by the governor (judges, cabinet secretaries and others) as stated by law or Constitution.\nThe Legislative Assembly, with the consent of two-thirds of each chamber may propose amendments to the constitution. Proposed amendments are then subject to approval by the people of Puerto Rico in a referendum. It also has the power to consolidate or create municipalities.\nQualifications.\nUnder Article III, Sections 5 and 6, members of the Legislative Assembly must be fluent in either Spanish or English, must be a citizen of the United States and Puerto Rico, and have resided in Puerto Rico for at least two years prior to their election. Senators must be at least 30 years old, while House representatives must be at least 25 years old. Both Senators and Representatives (except those elected &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt;) must reside in their constituent district at least one year prior to their election.\nMoves to unicameralism.\nAct No. 477 of September 23, 2004 provided for a referendum to be held on July 10, 2005, in which Puerto Rican voters were to indicate if they favored changing the Legislative Assembly to a single house, or maintain the bicameral legislature established by the 1917 Jones Act, which had been retained (with modifications) by the 1952 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. A vote for unicameralism would constitute a mandate for the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on July 9, 2007 on the constitutional amendment that would establish a unicameral legislature by 2009.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rican%20unicameralism%20referendum%2C%202005\"&gt;unicameral referendum&lt;/a&gt; held on July 10, 2005, Puerto Rican voters approved a mandate for the Legislative Assembly to hold a second referendum on the constitutional amendment that would establish &lt;a href=\"unicameralism\"&gt;unicameral legislature&lt;/a&gt; by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against; &lt;a href=\"voter%20turnout\"&gt;voter turnout&lt;/a&gt; was only 22.6%, the lowest turnout figure in Puerto Rico's electoral history, vastly below the 81.7% that had gone to the polls just a few months earlier for the general election. Another referendum was scheduled for July 2007 to approve the specific &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20amendment\"&gt;amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the Constitution of Puerto Rico that are required for the change. However, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Supreme Court of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; ruled in June that it could not force the Legislative Assembly to initiate a constitutional amendment process to become a single chamber legislature. Further moves to unicameralism have been &lt;a href=\"Table%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29%23Use%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;tabled&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgencies.\nAgencies of the legislative branch include:"
