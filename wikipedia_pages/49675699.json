    "text": "Eremophila rhegos is a &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the figwort &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scrophulariaceae\"&gt;Scrophulariaceae&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It is an erect shrub with densely hairy leaves and branches and blue, mauve, purple or white flowers.\nDescription.\n\"Eremophila rhegos\" is a shrub with many branches and which grows to a height of between . The branches and leaves are covered with a dense layer of branched, greyish-white hairs. The branches are thick and rough due to the presence of persistent, raised leaf bases. The leaves are crowded near the ends of the branches, overlapping each other. They are thick, elliptic to lance-shaped, mostly long, wide and have an obvious mid-vein.\nThe flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on densely hairy stalks, long. There are 5 lance-shaped, densely hairy &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s which are long. The &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is deep purple, blue or light lilac-coloured to white on the outside, and white with purple spots inside. The petal tube and lobes are &lt;a href=\"Glabrousness\"&gt;glabrous&lt;/a&gt; except for a few hairs around the margins of the lobes and the inside of the tube which is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to September and the fruits which follow are oval-shaped and about long.\nTaxonomy and naming.\nThis species was first formally described by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Chinnock\"&gt;Robert Chinnock&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 and the description was published in \"Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae\". The &lt;a href=\"Botanical%20name\"&gt;specific epithet&lt;/a&gt; (\"rhegos\") is an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; word (\"\u1fe5\u1fc6\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\") meaning \"rug\" or \"blanket\", referring to the dense covering, especially on the branches and sepals.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Eremophila rhegos\" grows in &lt;a href=\"Orthent\"&gt;skeletal soils&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Landor%20Station\"&gt;Landor Station&lt;/a&gt; and Dairy Creek Station in the &lt;a href=\"Gascoyne%20%28biogeographic%20region%29\"&gt;Gascoyne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Murchison%20%28biogeographic%20region%29\"&gt;Murchison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"IBRA\"&gt;biogeographic regions&lt;/a&gt;.\nConservation.\nThis eremophila is classified as \"&lt;a href=\"Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List\"&gt;Priority One&lt;/a&gt;\" by the Western Australian Government &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Department of Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.\nUse in horticulture.\nThis shrub has not often been grown in gardens and its requirements are not currently well known. It can be propagated from &lt;a href=\"Cutting%20%28plant%29\"&gt;cuttings&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href=\"grafting\"&gt;grafting&lt;/a&gt; onto \"&lt;a href=\"Myoporum\"&gt;Myoporum&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"rootstock\"&gt;rootstock&lt;/a&gt;. It is growing in full sun in well-drained soil, is drought tolerant and tolerates light frosts."
