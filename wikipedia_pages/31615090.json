    "text": "Enneapogon nigricans, known by the common names blackheads, bottle washers, pappus grass, purpletop grass, and niggerheads, is a perennial Australian &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistinctive lance-shaped seedheads appear in late &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28season%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"summer\"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt;. They form at the top of wiry stalks over 30\u00a0cm long. They start as an olive green colour, but dry to a light brown. The seed itself is much like a &lt;a href=\"parasol\"&gt;parasol&lt;/a&gt; in appearance, and is around 5mm across. &lt;a href=\"Germination\"&gt;Germination&lt;/a&gt; is slow and unreliable and requires warm temperatures.\nLeaves are smooth and of a bright, light green. Plants like sunny positions and generally grow in sunny, open &lt;a href=\"Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands\"&gt;mallee&lt;/a&gt; forests. Plants form tall dense tussocks to a maximum of only 20\u00a0cm across. They die down in late summer, before reshooting when the rains return."
