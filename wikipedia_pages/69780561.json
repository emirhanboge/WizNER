    "text": "Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Reserva Natural Isla de Caja de Muertos\") is a nature reserve in southern &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; consisting of the islands of &lt;a href=\"Caja%20de%20Muertos\"&gt;Caja de Muertos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrillito\"&gt;Cayo Morrillito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Berber%C3%ADa\"&gt;Cayo Berber\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, and their surrounding reefs and waters in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. This nature reserve was founded on January 2, 1980, by the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Planning%20Board\"&gt;Puerto Rico Planning Board&lt;/a&gt; (\"Junta de Planificaci\u00f3n\") as recommended by the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Department%20of%20Natural%20and%20Environmental%20Resources\"&gt;Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources&lt;/a&gt; (\"Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales de Puerto Rico\", DRNA) with the purpose of preserving the &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry%20broadleaf%20forests\"&gt;subtropical dry forest&lt;/a&gt; ecosystems found within these islands, some important &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt; nesting sites, and the marine habitats found on their surrounding reefs and waters.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Caja de Muertos\" (coffin) literally translates \"dead man's chest\" from Spanish. The name most likely comes from the original French name for the island, \"Coffre \u00e0 Mort\", first given by 18th century French writer and explorer &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Labat\"&gt;Jean Baptist Labat&lt;/a&gt; due to the island's shape. Although the island was never permanently populated, throughout its history it has served as a &lt;a href=\"Piracy%20in%20the%20Caribbean\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; hideout, a place for clandestine meetings for the island's &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Freemasons&lt;/a&gt; during the Spanish Catholic rule, and for secret gatherings of &lt;a href=\"Independence%20movement%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico independence movement&lt;/a&gt; leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Emeterio%20Betances\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Segundo%20Ruiz%20Belvis\"&gt;Segundo Ruiz Belvis&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the presence of &lt;a href=\"Petroglyph\"&gt;petroglyphs&lt;/a&gt; is evidence of the former presence of the &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%ADno\"&gt;Ta\u00edno&lt;/a&gt; people on the island. The other surrounding islands and keys show no evidence of historical human activity or population.\nThe Spanish built a lighthouse on the island in 1883, which was updated and automated in 1945. The island had no more human activity until the later part of the 20th century when some infrastructure, such as restrooms, gazebos and other buildings were built for visitors. The area was not formally protected until January 2 of 1980 when a proposal by the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Department%20of%20Natural%20and%20Environmental%20Resources\"&gt;Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources&lt;/a&gt; (DRNA) to establish the island and surrounding keys as a nature reserve was approved by the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Planning%20Board\"&gt;Puerto Rico Planning Board&lt;/a&gt;. The island today is of ecological importance due to its preserved subtropical tropical dry forest; in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%A1nica%20State%20Forest\"&gt;Gu\u00e1nica State Forest&lt;/a&gt; this is one of the last tracts of its type in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.\nGeography.\nThe nature reserve covers a land area of approximately 400 acres (412 \"cuerdas\") and it includes the following islands and keys connected by shallow water banks:\nThe islands belonging to the Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve are part of a larger archipelago that extends off Puerto Rico's Caribbean coast from east to west. Some of these other southern islands include Cayo Cabezazos, Cayo Caracoles, Cayo Alfe\u00f1ique, the Cayos Ratones and the Cayos P\u00e1jaros. Most of these keys are protected as part of the &lt;a href=\"Punta%20Petrona%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Punta Petrona Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Isabel%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Santa Isabel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%ADa%20de%20Jobos\"&gt;Jobos Bay Reserve&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Salinas%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Salinas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guayama%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Guayama&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe highest point in both Caja de Muertos and the nature reserve is the 240 feet (73 m) high unnamed hill where the &lt;a href=\"Caja%20de%20Muertos%20Light\"&gt;Caja de Muertos Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; is located. The island's geography also includes rocky cliffs, caves, a flat plateau that is home to an extensive tropical dry forest, a lagoon with mangroves, and a small &lt;a href=\"promontory\"&gt;promontory&lt;/a&gt; (\"morro\") located on the southwestern-most point of the island, across from the small key of &lt;a href=\"Morrillito\"&gt;Morrillito&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish for \"small promontory\").\nEcology.\nThe ecological diversity of the Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve includes &lt;a href=\"Mangrove%20forest\"&gt;mangrove forests&lt;/a&gt;, sandy shores important for &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt; nesting, rocky coasts and cliffs which are important bird areas, caves and &lt;a href=\"Xerophyte\"&gt;xerophytic&lt;/a&gt; (dry and thorny) forests. Due to the close proximity of Caja de Muertos and Berber\u00eda to land, most of the local species originate in the main island of Puerto Rico.\nFauna.\nThis nature reserve serves as a shelter, nesting and feeding place for a number of species of birds and marine animals, in addition to many migratory and introduced species. Some notable bird species of the reserve includes &lt;a href=\"Brown%20pelican\"&gt;brown pelicans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brown%20booby\"&gt;brown boobies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osprey\"&gt;ospreys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roseate%20tern\"&gt;roseate terns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Least%20tern\"&gt;least terns&lt;/a&gt;, and the endangered &lt;a href=\"black-capped%20petrel\"&gt;black-capped petrel&lt;/a&gt;. The only fully terrestrial species found in the islands are the common Puerto Rican ameiva (&lt;a href=\"Common%20Puerto%20Rican%20ameiva\"&gt;\"Pholidoscelis exsul\"&lt;/a&gt;), the threatened Puerto Rican blue-tailed ameiva (\"&lt;a href=\"Pholidoscelis%20wetmorei\"&gt;Ameiva wetmorei&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the Puerto Rican racer snake (\"&lt;a href=\"Borikenophis%20portoricensis\"&gt;Borikenophis portoricensis&lt;/a&gt;\"). At least two species of sea turtle nest in Caja de Muertos and Morrillito islands: green sea turtles (\"&lt;a href=\"Green%20sea%20turtle\"&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/a&gt;\") and hawksbill sea turtles (\"&lt;a href=\"Hawksbill%20sea%20turtle\"&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/a&gt;\"), which are endangered and critically endangered, respectively.\nFlora.\nThe flora that occurs in the Caja de Muertos reserve is similar to that found in the Gu\u00e1nica State Forest. &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cacti&lt;/a&gt; and other xerophytic species are common throughout Caja de Muertos and Morrillito. The rest of the vegetation is &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; and mostly covers areas that have &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; soil. Examples of rare or unique flora species found in the area include serpentine manjack (\"&lt;a href=\"Varronia%20bellonis\"&gt;Varronia bellonis&lt;/a&gt;\") and \"&lt;a href=\"Portulaca%20caulerpoides\"&gt;Portulaca caulerpoides&lt;/a&gt;\", which are endemic to Puerto Rico. Other distinctive flora is the &lt;a href=\"Laguncularia%20racemosa\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conocarpus%20erectus\"&gt;button mangrove&lt;/a&gt; on the sea-level mangrove basins, \"manzanillo de muertos\" or manchineel (Hippomane mancinella) in the drier areas, and algae and \"&lt;a href=\"Thalassia%20testudinum\"&gt;Thalassia&lt;/a&gt;\" on the seagrass prairies. The Puerto Rican applecactus (\"&lt;a href=\"Harrisia%20portoricensis\"&gt;Harrisia portoricensis&lt;/a&gt;\") is a critically endangered species of cactus from the &lt;a href=\"Isla%20de%20Mona\"&gt;Mona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monito%20Island\"&gt;Monito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desecheo%20Island\"&gt;Desecheo&lt;/a&gt; islands in &lt;a href=\"Mona%20Passage\"&gt;La Mona Passage&lt;/a&gt; that was introduced to Caja de Muertos by the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Department%20of%20Natural%20and%20Environmental%20Resources\"&gt;DRNA&lt;/a&gt;. It is locally known as \"higo chumbo\", meaning \"weighed-down \"prickly pear\"\" due to the leaning cactus arms caused by the weight of their fruit.\nCoral reefs.\nThe coral reef area in the nature reserve is among the most expansive and most preserved in Puerto Rico. Most of the coral is found on the northeastern reefs along Caja de Muertos; it serves as home and nursery to numerous fish species.\nRecreation.\nCaja de Muertos can be reached by ferry from &lt;a href=\"Paseo%20Tablado%20La%20Guancha\"&gt;La Guancha Boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Playa%2C%20Ponce%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Playa de Ponce&lt;/a&gt;. The reserve is open to hikers and beachgoers; there are four beaches in the reserve: Pelicano Beach, Playa Larga, Carrucho Beach and Coast Guard Beach. Snorkeling is allowed in the reserve."
