    "text": "David Fern\u00e1ndez Borbal\u00e1n (born 30 May 1973) is a retired Spanish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt;. His first match officiating in &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; was on 12 September 2004, between &lt;a href=\"Levante%20UD\"&gt;Levante UD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Racing%20de%20Santander\"&gt;Racing de Santander&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorbal\u00e1n also refereed a key match in &lt;a href=\"Synot%20liga\"&gt;Synot liga&lt;/a&gt; season 2014\u201315 between &lt;a href=\"AC%20Sparta%20Prague\"&gt;AC Sparta Prague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Viktoria%20Plze%C5%88\"&gt;FC Viktoria Plze\u0148&lt;/a&gt; on 9 May 2015.\nHe was chosen, upon validation from &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, to referee the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Greek%20Football%20Cup%23Final\"&gt;2018 Greek Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"AEK%20Athens%20F.C.\"&gt;AEK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PAOK%20FC\"&gt;PAOK&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Athens%29\"&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, amidst concerns over supporter riots and violence during the game and despite protests by Greek football chairmen and refereeing bodies over the appointment of non-Greek officials. Two weeks later, he took charge of his final La Liga fixture, a 1\u20130 win for &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Espanyol\"&gt;RCD Espanyol&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao\"&gt;Athletic Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%282013%29\"&gt;San Mam\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt; in a match which meant little to the fortunes of the teams involved but was played at a venue specified as being preferred by the referee for his last appointment."
