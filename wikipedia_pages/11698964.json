    "text": "The Prix du Lys is a &lt;a href=\"Conditions%20races\"&gt;Group 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flat%20racing\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horse%20racing\"&gt;horse race&lt;/a&gt; in France open to three-year-old &lt;a href=\"thoroughbred\"&gt;thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Colt%20%28horse%29\"&gt;colts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gelding\"&gt;gelding&lt;/a&gt;s. It is run at &lt;a href=\"Longchamp%20Racecourse\"&gt;Longchamp&lt;/a&gt; over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1\u00bd miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in May.\nHistory.\nThe event is named after Le Lys, a small forest close to Chantilly on the left bank of the &lt;a href=\"Oise%20%28river%29\"&gt;Oise&lt;/a&gt; river. It was established in 1922, and was originally open to colts and fillies, but not geldings. Its distance was 2,400 metres. It was initially restricted to horses not entered for the &lt;a href=\"Prix%20du%20Jockey%20Club\"&gt;Prix du Jockey Club&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Prix%20de%20Diane\"&gt;Prix de Diane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prix du Lys was cancelled in 1940, and was held at &lt;a href=\"Longchamp%20Racecourse\"&gt;Longchamp&lt;/a&gt; in 1941 and 1942. It was run at &lt;a href=\"Tremblay%20Park\"&gt;Le Tremblay&lt;/a&gt; over 2,300 metres in 1943 and 1944, and at Longchamp again for three years thereafter.\nThe exclusion of Prix du Jockey Club and Prix de Diane entrants ended in 1970. The race was closed to fillies and opened to geldings in 1986.\nThe Prix du Lys was contested over 2,800 metres at &lt;a href=\"Saint-Cloud%20Racecourse\"&gt;Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt; from 1993 to 1996. In the following years it was run over 2,600 metres at &lt;a href=\"Maisons-Laffitte%20Racecourse\"&gt;Maisons-Laffitte&lt;/a&gt; (1997\u201398) and Chantilly (1999\u20132000).\nThe race's original distance was restored in 2001, and from this point it was staged at Longchamp. It returned to Chantilly in 2009 and was run there until 2016. In 2017 it was run at Saint-Cloud and since 2018 it has been staged at Longchamp again. It is currently held on the same day as the Prix d'Ispahan and Prix Saint-Alary.\nRecords.\nLeading &lt;a href=\"jockey\"&gt;jockey&lt;/a&gt; (6 wins):\nLeading &lt;a href=\"Horse%20trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; (15 wins):\nLeading owner (6 wins):"
