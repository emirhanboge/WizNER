Gonsoulin played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Baylor%20University\"&gt;Baylor University&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of his stint with the Broncos, he was the AFL's all-time leader in interceptions with 40. He made the first interception ever in the AFL, in the first league game against the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Patriots\"&gt;Boston Patriots&lt;/a&gt;. He had seven interceptions in his first three games, and his 11 pickoffs in 1960 are still a Denver club record. He shares the team record for interceptions in a game with four, a feat he accomplished September 18, 1960 at Buffalo.\nGonsoulin was a \"&lt;a href=\"Sporting%20News\"&gt;Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\" AFL All-League player in &lt;a href=\"1960%20American%20Football%20League%20All-League%20Players\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1962%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"1963%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League%20All-Star%20games\"&gt;AFL Western Division All-Star&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1961%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1964%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1966%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;. His amazing durability and toughness enabled him to start 61 consecutive games at one point in his career. He was also the captain of his college team at Baylor. Gonsoulin was selected to the second unit of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League%20All-Time%20Team\"&gt;American Football League All-Time Team&lt;/a&gt;.\nGonsoulin died on September 8, 2014."
