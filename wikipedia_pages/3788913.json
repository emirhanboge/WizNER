    "text": "Lavras is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt; state, Brazil. Located at an altitude of 919 m, it has a population of 104,783 inhabitants (2020). The area of the municipality is 564.495\u00a0km2. The average annual temperature is 19.6\u00b0C and the average annual rainfall is 1,511 millimetres.\nLocated at the Green Valley and Waterfalls tourist circuit, it is also near Waters circuit \u2013 a series of spas in the state of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and the &lt;a href=\"Inconfid%C3%AAncia%20Mineira\"&gt;Inconfidentes&lt;/a&gt; Trail circuit \u2013 a historical region of Minas. Lavras is connected by &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Highway%20System\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; to the state capital, &lt;a href=\"Belo%20Horizonte\"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt; (237\u00a0km), to &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28city%29\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; (379\u00a0km) and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; (423\u00a0km).\nHistory.\nEarly settlement.\nThe settlements on the \"Campos de Sant'Ana das Lavras do Funil\" dated from the first half of the 18th century, founded in 1729. The first inhabitants were the &lt;a href=\"Paulistas\"&gt;Paulista&lt;/a&gt; family of Francisco Bueno da Fonseca (\u20131752), leader of a revolt against a &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Brazil\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; judge in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1712. Bueno da Fonseca, his sons and other explorers, settled in the rivers and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Grande%20%28Paran%C3%A1%20River%29\"&gt;Grande&lt;/a&gt; region by 1720 or 1721, where they were engaged in the search for gold and in the opening of new roads to the &lt;a href=\"Goi%C3%A1s\"&gt;Goi\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt; mines. In 1737 the explorers receive from the Governor Martinho de Mendon\u00e7a an allotment letter confirming their region occupation, which grew through agriculture and livestock.\nOn June 18, 1759, , &lt;a href=\"Bartolomeu%20Bueno%20da%20Silva\"&gt;Anhang\u00fcera&lt;/a&gt;'s grandson and Francisco Bueno da Fonseca's son-in-law, left the village heading 400 men, summoned from the entire Minas Gerais captaincy, to disrupt the &lt;a href=\"quilombo\"&gt;quilombo&lt;/a&gt; confederation of Campo Grande. The influence of &lt;a href=\"Captaincy\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; Bueno da Fonseca's family contributed to the village's rapid growing. In 1760 they managed to change the &lt;a href=\"Freguesia%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; seat from &lt;a href=\"Carrancas\"&gt;Carrancas&lt;/a&gt;, as Lavras do Funil already had 1,000 inhabitants, twice more than the former. In 1813 the village was elevated to &lt;a href=\"freguesia\"&gt;freguesia&lt;/a&gt;, detaching itself from Carrancas. That time, Lavras had 6 chapels and a population of 10,612 souls.\n19th century.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Imperial period&lt;/a&gt;, Lavras obtained its political and administrative emancipation, becoming a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in 1831 and city in 1868, when there was a change in municipal toponymic from \"\"Lavras do Funil\" to \"Lavras\"\". In 1832 the inspector Manuel Cust\u00f3dio Neto reported to the &lt;a href=\"municipal%20chamber\"&gt;municipal chamber&lt;/a&gt; that the town consisted of 245 buildings and there was no pavement on its streets. The only public buildings where the , and the &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Rosary\"&gt;Ros\u00e1rio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20of%20Mercy\"&gt;Merc\u00eas&lt;/a&gt; chapels. Lavras had three private primary schools, with a total of 62 students. According to the 1834 census, Lavras had 11,322 inhabitants.\nOne of the most significant events of this period was the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Revolution%20of%201842\"&gt;Liberal Revolution of 1842&lt;/a&gt;. For just over a month, between June 14 and July 22, and &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28Brazil%29\"&gt;conservatives&lt;/a&gt; kept their barracks in Sant'Ana main square, current Pra\u00e7a Dr. Augusto Silva. The defeated liberals fled or were arrested, subsequently amnestied by the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;imperial government&lt;/a&gt;.\nGolden Age.\nThe late nineteenth century and early twentieth century was a time of rapid development in Lavras. On December 18, 1880, it was inaugurated the 208\u00a0km river navigation between the &lt;a href=\"Ribeir%C3%A3o%20Vermelho\"&gt;Ribeir\u00e3o Vermelho&lt;/a&gt; port (Lavras) and &lt;a href=\"Capetinga\"&gt;Capetinga&lt;/a&gt; port (municipality of &lt;a href=\"Piumhi\"&gt;Piumhi&lt;/a&gt;), made by &lt;a href=\"steamboat\"&gt;steamboat&lt;/a&gt; \"Dr. Jorge\". On April 14, 1888, the &lt;a href=\"Estrada%20de%20Ferro%20Oeste%20de%20Minas\"&gt;Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas&lt;/a&gt; inaugurated the first station in Ribeir\u00e3o Vermelho, and, on April 1, 1895, Lavras' city station is inaugurated. Later, in 1911, a tramway was opened, and so Lavras was one of the few cities in Brazilian interior to have this transportation system.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Proclamation%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Brazil%29\"&gt;Proclamation of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Lavras established itself as a major regional center of Minas Gerais, being the birthplace of , an important politician of the &lt;a href=\"Rep%C3%BAblica%20Velha\"&gt;Old Republic&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, several colleges were created, such as the Evangelical Institute (founded in 1892 by Samuel Rhea Gammon), the College of Our Lady of Lourdes (founded in 1900 by nuns of the Congregation of the Auxiliary Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy), the Lavras School Group (founded in 1907 by Professor Firmino Costa) and the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20University%20of%20Lavras\"&gt;Agricultural School of Lavras&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 1908). The quality its education made Lavras to become known as \"the city of &lt;a href=\"ip%C3%AA\"&gt;ip\u00ea&lt;/a&gt;s and schools\", a slogan created by journalist Jorge Duarte.\nSocial and political changes.\nLocal demographics has been modified with the arrival of many immigrants, representing 1.9% of the population according to Census 1920: the municipality had a total of 806 foreigners, of which 380 were &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Brazilian\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, 189 were &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Brazilians\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, 166 &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Brazilians\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt;, 28 &lt;a href=\"Brazilians%20of%20Spanish%20descent\"&gt;Spaniards&lt;/a&gt;, 20 &lt;a href=\"Americans%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Brazilian\"&gt;Austrians&lt;/a&gt;, five &lt;a href=\"French%20Brazilians\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, two Russians, one &lt;a href=\"Uruguayan%20Brazilian\"&gt;Uruguayan&lt;/a&gt; and three of undetermined nationality.\nThe 1920s represented a slowdown in Lavras progress, partly caused by the intense political dispute promoted by two distinct groups: the &lt;a href=\"Mineiro%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Mineiro Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, under the new direction of Italian doctor Paulo Menicucci, was favorable to the candidacy of &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Bernardes\"&gt;Arthur Bernardes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Presidency&lt;/a&gt; and Raul Soares to the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Presidency of Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;; and dissidents, led by Colonel Pedro Sales, supported the respective opposition candidacies of &lt;a href=\"Nilo%20Pe%C3%A7anha\"&gt;Nilo Pe\u00e7anha&lt;/a&gt; and Francisco Sales. This dispute became known as between \"Doves and Hawks\": Doves because of effeminate &lt;a href=\"Psychasthenia\"&gt;psychasthenics&lt;/a&gt; tics attributed to Bernardes, and Hawks for associating the cleverness, the cunning spirit, and, of course, as one of the little dove predators. Such local clash lasted until the following decade, when it was eclipsed by the new national political order \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Estado%20Novo%20%28Brazil%29\"&gt;Estado Novo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was in the mid-twentieth century that Lavras constituted its current geographic boundaries. In its administrative division for the year 1933, the municipality was formed by eight districts: Lavras, &lt;a href=\"Carrancas\"&gt;Carrancas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ijaci\"&gt;Ijaci&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Concei\u00e7\u00e3o do Rio Grande), &lt;a href=\"Inga%C3%AD\"&gt;Inga\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Itumirim\"&gt;Itumirim&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Ros\u00e1rio), &lt;a href=\"Itutinga\"&gt;Itutinga&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Ponte Nova), &lt;a href=\"Lumin%C3%A1rias\"&gt;Lumin\u00e1rias&lt;/a&gt; (Nossa Senhora do Carmo das Lumin\u00e1rias) and Ribeir\u00e3o Vermelho. The municipality has experienced political and administrative separation in 1938, 1943, 1948 and 1962, when their old districts became newly created neighboring municipalities and is currently composed of single district, the urban agglomeration's city.\nProgress and stagnation.\n On the populist period during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Brazilian%20Republic\"&gt;Fourth Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Lavras development was signaled by new links with major centers: firstly, it was the inauguration of air transport line, that existed between 1947 and 1960; secondly was the Lavras-&lt;a href=\"Rodovia%20Fern%C3%A3o%20Dias\"&gt;Fern\u00e3o Dias&lt;/a&gt; patch opening to road traffic in 1962. Another aspect of progress was the inauguration of the Itutinga &lt;a href=\"hydroelectric\"&gt;hydroelectric&lt;/a&gt; power plant in 1955, which increased electricity production and stimulated industrial growth in the city, through the expansion of existing plants and setting up new ventures.\nLavras, in the 1950s, passed by one of its moments of greatest cultural, artistic and sporting wealth thanks to civic associations such as the Lavras Friends Society (Sal) and Lavrense Society of Artistic Culture (Solca). Chroniclers of the time remember several initiatives such as balls, competitions, exhibitions, educational events, theatrical performances, music recitals and poetry, friendly football tournaments and also the formation of a public library and a city museum.\nIn the early 1960s, while the country experienced a period of &lt;a href=\"1964%20Brazilian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;serious institutional crises&lt;/a&gt;, Lavras suffered a series of attacks made by a &lt;a href=\"pyromaniac\"&gt;pyromaniac&lt;/a&gt;, in which several historical houses were consumed by the flames. In this context, in 1962 the local authorities decided the Municipal Theatre demolition, sealing the end of civic organizations and city's cultural decay. This decline was exacerbated in 1963 by the newspaper \"A Gazeta\" disappearance \u2013 the only printed weekly at the time \u2013 and almost closing of the Agricultural School of Lavras, which was federalized. Other signs of visible &lt;a href=\"Anomie\"&gt;social degradation&lt;/a&gt; were the collapse of the Rosary church walls in 1965, rebuilt only in 1970, and the end of the tramway in 1967.\nThe 1960s and 1970s represented profound changes in Lavras social composition. On one hand, there was the growth of urban areas due to &lt;a href=\"rural%20exodus\"&gt;rural exodus&lt;/a&gt;; on the other, it was noted that the city's population growth was below the national average, caused by the phenomenon of &lt;a href=\"internal%20migration\"&gt;internal migration&lt;/a&gt;: as Lavras being economically stagnant, many of its children have moved to other centers looking for better opportunities. Another sign of the municipality weakening was the lack of political representation, which would be broken fourteen years later with the election of Maur\u00edcio Souza P\u00e1dua to the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt; in 1983.\nNew millennium.\nOn the eve of the 21st century, Lavras resumed its development path, being currently one of the most prosperous cities in the region, claiming in 2010 the second highest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Brazilian%20federative%20units%20by%20Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;HDI&lt;/a&gt; in southern Minas Gerais. This progress is the result of a number of factors, mainly: the installation of the &lt;a href=\"industrial%20district\"&gt;industrial district&lt;/a&gt;, which has brought several factories, such as &lt;a href=\"Magneti%20Marelli\"&gt;COFAP&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated in February 1988, generating many jobs; the transformation of ESAL into the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20University%20of%20Lavras\"&gt;Federal University of Lavras&lt;/a&gt;, in December 1994, whose recent expansion brought thousands of students from other regions of Brazil; and the construction of the Funil Hydroelectric Plant in 2002, which changed the countryside by the dam's formed lake.\nNevertheless, this development has also generated new problems in Lavras, such as drug trafficking and increased violence: from 2000\u20132002 to 2010\u20132012, the number of homicides caused by firearms increased from 4 to 18. Another problem seen today is a major dispute between rival political groups, dividing the city with intensity not seen since the 1920s.\nEconomy.\nAs 2013, Lavras gross domestic product is R$2,058,203,000, or R$20,965 per capita. Of the GDP, agriculture corresponds to 2.7%, industry to 20.4%, services to 65.3%, while taxes are 11.6%.\nAgriculture and livestock.\nLavras agricultural sector stands out especially for the production of coffee and milk, despite the presence of other crops and beef cattle breeding. The production data in 2014 according to the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Institute%20of%20Geography%20and%20Statistics\"&gt;Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics&lt;/a&gt;:\nEducation.\n In 2012, Lavras had 31 &lt;a href=\"preschool\"&gt;preschool&lt;/a&gt;, 37 primary schools, 16 secondary schools and 3 &lt;a href=\"special%20education\"&gt;special education&lt;/a&gt; centers. There were 18,671 students and 1,127 teachers. Lavras has also 9 higher education universities and faculties.\nFederal University of Lavras.\nLavras has one of Brazil's top universities, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20University%20of%20Lavras\"&gt;Federal University of Lavras&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1908 it is well known in Brazil and abroad for its courses in &lt;a href=\"agronomy\"&gt;agronomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"veterinary\"&gt;veterinary&lt;/a&gt; science. There are 6,090 &lt;a href=\"Undergraduate%20education\"&gt;undergraduate&lt;/a&gt; students and 2,059 on &lt;a href=\"Postgraduate%20education\"&gt;postgraduate programs&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport.\nLavras was a station on the &lt;a href=\"Estrada%20de%20Ferro%20Oeste%20de%20Minas\"&gt;Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas&lt;/a&gt;, a narrow gauge railway.\nSports.\nLavras is home of &lt;a href=\"Fabril%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Fabril Esporte Clube&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club that achieved minor success during the 1980s in &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Mineiro\"&gt;Minas Gerais state championship&lt;/a&gt;. Some famous athletes were born in Lavras, as the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil national football team&lt;/a&gt; defenders &lt;a href=\"Alem%C3%A3o%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29\"&gt;Alem\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ca%C3%A7apa\"&gt;Ca\u00e7apa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volleyball%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament\"&gt;Bronze medal Olympic winner&lt;/a&gt; volleyball player &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Paula%20Connelly\"&gt;Ana Paula Connelly&lt;/a&gt;."
