    "text": "A tradesman or tradesperson is a &lt;a href=\"skilled%20worker\"&gt;skilled worker&lt;/a&gt; that specializes in a particular &lt;a href=\"Trade%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; (occupation or field of work). Tradesmen usually have &lt;a href=\"work%20experience\"&gt;work experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"on-the-job%20training\"&gt;on-the-job training&lt;/a&gt;, and often formal &lt;a href=\"vocational%20education\"&gt;vocational education&lt;/a&gt; in contrast to an &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, who is learning the trade.\nAs opposed to a &lt;a href=\"Master%20craftsman\"&gt;craftsman&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt; the occupation of a tradesman is not necessarily restricted to manual work.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20England\"&gt;Victorian England&lt;/a&gt;:\nOne study of &lt;a href=\"Caversham%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Caversham, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"turn%20of%20the%20century\"&gt;turn of the century&lt;/a&gt; notes that a skilled trade was considered a trade that required an &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt; to entry. Skilled tradesmen worked either in traditional &lt;a href=\"handicraft\"&gt;handicraft&lt;/a&gt; workshops or newer factories that emerged during the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional handicraft roles included, for example: \"&lt;a href=\"sail-maker\"&gt;sail-maker&lt;/a&gt;, candle-maker, &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20%28profession%29\"&gt;cooper&lt;/a&gt;, japanner, &lt;a href=\"lapidary\"&gt;lapidary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"taxidermist\"&gt;taxidermist&lt;/a&gt;, canister-maker, &lt;a href=\"furrier\"&gt;furrier&lt;/a&gt;, cap-maker, dobbin-maker, &lt;a href=\"French%20polish\"&gt;french-polisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baker\"&gt;baker&lt;/a&gt;, miller, &lt;a href=\"brewer\"&gt;brewer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"confectioner\"&gt;confectioner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"watch-maker\"&gt;watch-maker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tinsmith\"&gt;tinsmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glazier\"&gt;glazier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"maltster\"&gt;maltster&lt;/a&gt;, wood-turner, saddler, &lt;a href=\"shipwright\"&gt;shipwright&lt;/a&gt;, scale-maker, &lt;a href=\"engraver\"&gt;engraver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cutlery\"&gt;cutler&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nModern use and list of skilled trades.\nTradesmen are contrasted with unskilled workers, &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; workers, and &lt;a href=\"professional\"&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt;s (those in the learned professions). Skilled tradesmen are distinguished:\nThere is no definitive list of modern skilled trades, as definitions vary, with some lists being broader than others.\nEarnings and social standing.\nA British study found that, after taking student loan repayments into account, a higher &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt; (at level 5 in the &lt;a href=\"National%20qualifications%20frameworks%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;national qualifications frameworks&lt;/a&gt;) delivered higher lifetime median earnings than a degree from a university outside the &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Group\"&gt;Russell Group&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, polling for the report found that apprenticeships have a lower perceived value than &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;s.\nData from the United States shows that, although &lt;a href=\"vocational%20education\"&gt;vocational education&lt;/a&gt; is usually less financially lucrative in the long term than a bachelor's degree, it can still provide a respectable income at much less cost in time and money for training. Even ten years after graduation, there are many people with a certificate or associate degree who earn more money than those with a B.A.\nThe average &lt;a href=\"taxable%20income\"&gt;taxable income&lt;/a&gt; for the top trades in Australia can be up to $100,000, while the average for all Australians is $85,800. As of 2020, the fastest growing trades in demand are Fencing, Handyman and Roofing."
