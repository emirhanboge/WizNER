    "text": "Donald in Mathmagic Land is a 1959 American &lt;a href=\"Animation\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"live-action\"&gt;live-action&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"featurette\"&gt;featurette&lt;/a&gt; produced by &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios\"&gt;Walt Disney Productions&lt;/a&gt; and featuring &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Duck\"&gt;Donald Duck&lt;/a&gt;. The short was directed by &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Luske\"&gt;Hamilton Luske&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Reitherman\"&gt;Wolfgang Reitherman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Les%20Clark\"&gt;Les Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Meador\"&gt;Joshua Meador&lt;/a&gt; as sequence directors) and was released on June 26, 1959. It was nominated for an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Documentary%20%28Short%20Subject%29\"&gt;Best Documentary (Short Subject)&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"32nd%20Academy%20Awards\"&gt;32nd Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, and became a widely viewed &lt;a href=\"educational%20film\"&gt;educational film&lt;/a&gt; in American schools of the 1960s.\nPlot.\n1: Very Strange.\nThe film begins with &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Duck\"&gt;Donald Duck&lt;/a&gt;, holding a hunting rifle, passing through a doorway to find that he has entered Mathmagic Land. This \"mighty strange\" fantasy land contains trees with &lt;a href=\"square%20root\"&gt;square root&lt;/a&gt;s, a stream flowing with &lt;a href=\"number\"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;s, and a walking pencil that plays &lt;a href=\"tic-tac-toe\"&gt;tic-tac-toe&lt;/a&gt;. A geometric bird recites (almost perfectly) the first 15 digits of &lt;a href=\"pi\"&gt;pi&lt;/a&gt;. Donald soon hears the voice of the unseen \"True Spirit of Adventure\" (&lt;a href=\"Paul%20Frees\"&gt;Paul Frees&lt;/a&gt;), who will guide him on his journey through \"the wonderland of mathematics\".\n2: The Time Of Pythagoras.\nDonald is initially not interested in exploring Mathmagic Land, believing that math is just for \"&lt;a href=\"egghead\"&gt;egghead&lt;/a&gt;s\". When \"Mr. Spirit\" suggests a connection between math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers the relationships between &lt;a href=\"octave\"&gt;octave&lt;/a&gt;s and string length which develop the &lt;a href=\"musical%20scale\"&gt;musical scale&lt;/a&gt; of today. Next, Donald finds himself in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Pythagoras\"&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt; and his contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on the &lt;a href=\"harp\"&gt;harp&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; player, and a &lt;a href=\"double%20bass\"&gt;double bass&lt;/a&gt; player hold a \"&lt;a href=\"jam%20session\"&gt;jam session&lt;/a&gt;\" which Donald joins after a few moments using a &lt;a href=\"vase\"&gt;vase&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"bongo%20drum\"&gt;bongo drum&lt;/a&gt;. Pythagoras' mathematical discoveries are, as the Spirit explains, the basis of today's music, and that music would not exist without \"eggheads\". The segment ends with a sequence of &lt;a href=\"live%20action\"&gt;live action&lt;/a&gt; musicians playing both &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; and Pythagoras' pals fading away.\n3: The Golden Rectangle.\nAfter shaking hands with Pythagoras, who then vanishes, Donald finds on his hand a &lt;a href=\"pentagram\"&gt;pentagram&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol of the secret &lt;a href=\"Pythagoreanism\"&gt;Pythagorean society&lt;/a&gt;. The Spirit then shows Donald how the mysterious &lt;a href=\"golden%20ratio\"&gt;golden section&lt;/a&gt; appears in the pentagram. Next, the pentagram is shown to contain the pattern for constructing golden rectangles many times over. According to the Spirit, the &lt;a href=\"golden%20rectangle\"&gt;golden rectangle&lt;/a&gt; has influenced both ancient and modern cultures in many ways. Donald then learns how the golden rectangle appears in many ancient buildings, such as the &lt;a href=\"Parthenon\"&gt;Parthenon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Notre-Dame%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Notre Dame cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Paintings such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa\"&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt;\" and various sculptures such as the &lt;a href=\"Venus%20de%20Milo\"&gt;Venus de Milo&lt;/a&gt; contain several golden rectangles. The use of the golden rectangle is found in modern architecture, such as the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Headquarters\"&gt;United Nations building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Modern painters have also rediscovered the magic of the golden rectangles.\n4: Mathematical Forms In Nature.\nThe Spirit shows Donald how the golden rectangle and pentagram are related to the human body and nature, respectively. The human body contains the \"ideal proportions\" of the golden section; Donald, overinterpreting the Spirit's advice, tries to make his own body fit such a proportion, but his efforts are to no avail; he ends up \"all pent up in a &lt;a href=\"pentagon\"&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt;\". The pentagram and pentagon are then shown to be found in many flowers and animals, such as the &lt;a href=\"petunia\"&gt;petunia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trachelospermum%20jasminoides\"&gt;star jasmine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"starfish\"&gt;starfish&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hoya%20carnosa\"&gt;waxflower&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of the inside of a &lt;a href=\"nautilus\"&gt;nautilus&lt;/a&gt; shell, the Spirit explains that the magic proportions of the golden section are often found in the &lt;a href=\"spiral\"&gt;spiral&lt;/a&gt;s of nature's designs, quoting Pythagoras: \"Everything is arranged according to number and mathematical shape\".\n5: Mathematics in Games.\nDonald then learns that mathematics applies not only to nature, architecture, and music, but also to games that are played on geometrical surfaces, including &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hopscotch\"&gt;hopscotch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"three-cushion%20billiard\"&gt;three-cushion billiard&lt;/a&gt;, so he enter in the themes of &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Carroll\"&gt;Lewis Carroll&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Looking-Glass\"&gt;Through the Looking-Glass&lt;/a&gt;\" are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was both a writer and a &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;. The extended &lt;a href=\"cue%20sports\"&gt;billiards&lt;/a&gt; scene, which features a non-speaking live actor, shows the calculations involved in the game's \"diamond system\", and Donald finally learns how to do the calculations, though he ends up making it tough for himself, spectacularly hitting ten cushions in a single shot nonetheless.\n6: Mathematical Thinking.\nThe Spirit then asks Donald to play a mental game, but he finds Donald's mind to be too cluttered with \"Antiquated Ideas\", \"Bungling\", \"False Concepts\", \"Superstitions\", and \"Confusion\". After some mental house-cleaning, Donald plays with a &lt;a href=\"circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt; in his mind, he spins them to make them respectively into a &lt;a href=\"sphere\"&gt;sphere&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"cone\"&gt;cone&lt;/a&gt;, and then he discovers useful inventions such as the &lt;a href=\"wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magnifying%20glass\"&gt;magnifying glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drill\"&gt;drill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28device%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"telescope\"&gt;telescope&lt;/a&gt;. Donald then discovers that pentagrams can be drawn inside each other indefinitely. Therefore, numbers provide an avenue to consider the &lt;a href=\"infinity\"&gt;infinite&lt;/a&gt;. The Spirit states that scientific knowledge and technological advances are unlimited, and the key to unlocking the doors of the future is mathematics. By the end of the film, Donald understands and appreciates the value of mathematics. The film closes with a quotation from &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Galilei\"&gt;Galileo Galilei&lt;/a&gt;: \"Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe\".\nProduction.\nThe film was directed by &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Luske\"&gt;Hamilton Luske&lt;/a&gt;. Contributors included &lt;a href=\"The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company\"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; artists John Hench and Art Riley, voice talent &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Frees\"&gt;Paul Frees&lt;/a&gt;, and scientific expert &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Haber\"&gt;Heinz Haber&lt;/a&gt;, who had worked on the Disney space shows. It was released on a bill with \"&lt;a href=\"Darby%20O%27Gill%20and%20the%20Little%20People\"&gt;Darby O'Gill and the Little People&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1959, it was nominated for an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Awards\"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for (&lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Documentary%20%28Short%20Subject%29\"&gt;Best Documentary \u2013 Short Subjects&lt;/a&gt;). In 1961, two years after its release, it was shown as part of the &lt;a href=\"An%20Adventure%20in%20Color/Mathmagicland\"&gt;first program&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series\"&gt;Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color&lt;/a&gt;\" with an introduction by &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Von%20Drake\"&gt;Ludwig Von Drake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe film was made available to schools and became one of the most popular &lt;a href=\"educational%20film\"&gt;educational film&lt;/a&gt;s ever made by Disney. As &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney\"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; himself explained, \"The cartoon is a good medium to stimulate interest. We have recently explained mathematics in a film and in that way excited public interest in this very important subject.\"\nHome media.\nThe short was released on November 11, 2008 on \"\".\nAdditional releases include:"
