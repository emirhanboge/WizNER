    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt; Sir John Lindsay, (1737 \u2013 4 June 1788) was a British naval officer of the 18th century, who achieved the rank of admiral late in his career. Joining the Navy during the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, he served off France, followed by service for several years as captain of a warship stationed in the West Indies. After war's end, he returned to Britain, serving as an &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20Burghs%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Aberdeen Burghs&lt;/a&gt; from 1767 to 1768. From August 1769 to March 1772 Lindsay was promoted to &lt;a href=\"commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;commodore&lt;/a&gt; and assigned as &lt;a href=\"commander-in-chief\"&gt;commander-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Indies%20Station\"&gt;East Indies Station&lt;/a&gt;. He resigned from the Navy for a period following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ushant%20%281778%29\"&gt;Battle of Ushant (1778)&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of France, during the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. In 1784 he was assigned as &lt;a href=\"commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;commodore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Fleet\"&gt;commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;. In the last year of his life, he was promoted to rear admiral as an honorary position, as his failing health prevented him from taking a command.\nHe and his wife had no children together, but he was known to have three illegitimate children, including two daughters and a son, each by different women. One was &lt;a href=\"Dido%20Elizabeth%20Belle\"&gt;Dido Elizabeth Belle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mixed-race\"&gt;mixed-race&lt;/a&gt; daughter born into &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; in 1761 in the West Indies. He entrusted the girl to his maternal uncle &lt;a href=\"William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield%20and%20Mansfield\"&gt;William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield&lt;/a&gt; to raise free in England. Murray served as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chief%20Justice\"&gt;Lord Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt;, ruling on cases important to the abolition of slavery. Belle was educated, married, and inherited money from Murray.\nFamily.\nHe was born John Lindsay in 1737 to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alexander%20Lindsay%2C%203rd%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Evelix\"&gt;Evelix&lt;/a&gt; (near &lt;a href=\"Dornoch\"&gt;Dornoch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Ross\"&gt;Easter Ross&lt;/a&gt;) and Amelia Murray, daughter of &lt;a href=\"David%20Murray%2C%205th%20Viscount%20of%20Stormont\"&gt;David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont&lt;/a&gt;. His mother was sister to &lt;a href=\"William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield\"&gt;William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;. Lindsay was educated as an aristocrat.\nHis sister &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Lindsay%20%2818th%20century%29\"&gt;Margaret Lindsay&lt;/a&gt; was tutored in painting by &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Ramsay%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Allan Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;. In 1752 she eloped and married him as his second wife. Her parents became alienated from her by the marriage, which they disapproved. Her brother John remained loyal to her until her death in 1782.\nNaval career.\nLindsay joined the navy during the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt; between Great Britain and France. He was made a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in 1756 commanding the fireship &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Pluto%20%281756%29\"&gt;\"Pluto\"&lt;/a&gt;. He participated in &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Hawke\"&gt;Sir Edward Hawke&lt;/a&gt;'s 1757 &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20Rochefort\"&gt;expedition to attack Rochefort&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest Indies.\nOn 29 September 1757, Lindsay was made &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sixth-rate\"&gt;28-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Trent%20%281757%29\"&gt;HMS \"Trent\"&lt;/a&gt;, serving from 1757 to 1763. He served in both the West Indies and in home waters during the war. \"Trent\" was among ships used to try to capture Spanish ships in the Caribbean.\n\"Trent\" was part of &lt;a href=\"George%20Pocock\"&gt;Sir George Pocock&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet at the taking of &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; from the Spanish in 1762. During that action, Lindsay took over command of the &lt;a href=\"third-rate\"&gt;80-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Cambridge%20%281755%29\"&gt;HMS \"Cambridge\"&lt;/a&gt; on 1 July when her commander &lt;a href=\"William%20Goostrey\"&gt;William Goostrey&lt;/a&gt; was killed by rifle fire from the &lt;a href=\"Morro%20Castle%20%28Havana%29\"&gt;Morro Castle&lt;/a&gt;, which he was trying to capture.\nFor this and \"many strong proofs of his valour\" shown in the battle, he was rewarded with a permanent command of HMS \"Cambridge\", the &lt;a href=\"third-rate\"&gt;70-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Marlborough\"&gt;HMS \"Marlborough\"&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Seventy-four%20%28ship%29\"&gt;74-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Dragon%20%281760%29\"&gt;HMS \"Dragon\"&lt;/a&gt; (it is unknown which he chose, and he was still on the \"Trent\" in December 1763). After his return to England following the conclusion of the war, Lindsay received a &lt;a href=\"knighthood\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; on 10 February 1764.\nLindsay returned to the West Indies, in command of the &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Tartar%20%281756%29\"&gt;\"Tartar\"&lt;/a&gt;. His ship carried one of &lt;a href=\"John%20Harrison\"&gt;John Harrison&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Marine%20chronometer\"&gt;chronometers&lt;/a&gt; for tests and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Erskine%2C%201st%20Baron%20Erskine\"&gt;Thomas Erskine&lt;/a&gt; was serving as one of his midshipmen.\nHe returned to Britain in 1765, following the conclusion of the war. Lindsay was &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20Burghs%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Aberdeen Burghs&lt;/a&gt; from 1767 to 1768.\nMarriage and family.\nWhile in the West Indies, Lindsay had a &lt;a href=\"mixed-race\"&gt;mixed-race&lt;/a&gt; daughter with an enslaved African woman, known as Maria Belle. They named her &lt;a href=\"Dido%20Elizabeth%20Belle\"&gt;Dido Elizabeth Belle&lt;/a&gt; at her birth in 1761. Under colony slave law, the mixed-race girl was born into slavery. When she was very young, Lindsay took her back to England and entrusted her to his maternal uncle, Lord Mansfield, and his wife, who were childless. Dido was baptized in Bloomsbury in 1765. The Murrays raised the girl with an orphaned cousin whom they were also rearing, and educated her. She lived with them for 30 years (Murray bequeathed her a lump sum and an annuity in his will in 1793).\nOn 19 September 1768, Lindsay married Mary, daughter of Sir William Milner. They had no children (by the end of his life, Lindsay was known to have fathered three illegitimate children, two girls and a boy, by three different women). He provided for a white daughter and his son in his will, asking his wife to look out for the daughter after his death in 1788, but did not address Belle. His uncle provided for her.\nEast Indies.\nFrom August 1769 to March 1772 Lindsay was promoted to &lt;a href=\"commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;commodore&lt;/a&gt; and assigned as &lt;a href=\"commander-in-chief\"&gt;commander-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Indies%20Station\"&gt;East Indies Station&lt;/a&gt;, flying his &lt;a href=\"broad%20pennant\"&gt;broad pennant&lt;/a&gt; flown from the frigate &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Stag%20%281758%29\"&gt;\"Stag\"&lt;/a&gt;. While in India, he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Bath\"&gt;Order of the Bath&lt;/a&gt; (28 June 1770), though he was still a relatively junior sea officer. He was ordered to investigate dealings between the &lt;a href=\"British%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;British East India Company&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"nawab\"&gt;nawab&lt;/a&gt;s. This made him unpopular with the company and he was soon recalled.\nUshant.\nFrom March to May 1778, he was the first captain of the &lt;a href=\"first-rate\"&gt;first-rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Victory\"&gt;HMS \"Victory\"&lt;/a&gt;. He was assigned as captain of the &lt;a href=\"second-rate\"&gt;90-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Prince%20George%20%281772%29\"&gt;HMS \"Prince George\"&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Keppel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Keppel\"&gt;Admiral Keppel&lt;/a&gt; decided to &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;raise his flag&lt;/a&gt; in \"Victory\" (with &lt;a href=\"John%20Campbell%20%28captain%29\"&gt;John Campbell&lt;/a&gt; as his &lt;a href=\"flag%20captain\"&gt;flag captain&lt;/a&gt;) after the ship's commissioning in May 1778. Lindsay commanded the \"Prince George\" in the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ushant%20%281778%29\"&gt;Battle of Ushant&lt;/a&gt; on 27 July 1778. After giving evidence against &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Palliser\"&gt;Sir Hugh Palliser&lt;/a&gt; to the ensuing &lt;a href=\"court%20martial\"&gt;courts martial&lt;/a&gt;, he resigned straight after Keppel. He refused to accept any command during &lt;a href=\"John%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sandwich\"&gt;Lord Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;'s administration of the Admiralty, thus missing the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life and death.\nSandwich and his successors appreciated Lindsay's ability, and he was appointed as &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20Commissioner\"&gt;Admiralty Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; between April and December 1783. He next was assigned as &lt;a href=\"commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;commodore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Fleet\"&gt;commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Trusty\"&gt;HMS \"Trusty\"&lt;/a&gt; as his flagship. At &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; 24 June 1784, he entertained the &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Caroline%20of%20Austria\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt; of Sicily on board his ship.\nSoon afterward, his health began to fail and he had to return to England. He was promoted to \"&lt;a href=\"rear%20admiral\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20squadron\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;\" on 24 September 1787. For health reasons he held it as an honorary role rather than an active one. He died at &lt;a href=\"Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire\"&gt;Marlborough&lt;/a&gt;, on his way from a health trip to &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt;, on 4 June 1788, aged fifty-one. He is buried in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;."
