    "title": "Sacerdotal state",
    "text": "A sacerdotal state is a state whose &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20state\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is also an ecclesiastical leader designated by a religious body. An example of this kind of state is the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;, whose head of state is the &lt;a href=\"pope\"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Andorra\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; operates under a semi-sacerdotal system, as one of its co-heads of state is the &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Urgell\"&gt;bishop of Urgell&lt;/a&gt;, while the other is the &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20France\"&gt;president of France&lt;/a&gt;. However unlike the Vatican, the &lt;a href=\"co-princes%20of%20Andorra\"&gt;co-princes of Andorra&lt;/a&gt; are not closely involved in the government.\nIn the past it was common for &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;s to assume civil as well as clerical power and rule as &lt;a href=\"prince-bishop\"&gt;prince-bishop&lt;/a&gt;s. This was common in the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, where three of the seven &lt;a href=\"Prince-elector\"&gt;imperial electors&lt;/a&gt; were prince-archbishops (&lt;a href=\"Elector%20of%20Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Mainz\"&gt;Mainz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elector%20of%20Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;). After the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; certain prince-bishoprics became bi-confessional and alternated between Catholic bishops and &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diocesan%20administrator\"&gt;administrators&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"English%20monarchs\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20monarchs\"&gt;British monarchs&lt;/a&gt; have held the title &lt;a href=\"supreme%20governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;supreme governor of the Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, signifying leadership of the &lt;a href=\"state%20church\"&gt;state church&lt;/a&gt;. The subsequent &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal&lt;/a&gt; and legal unions with &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%20and%201542\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; did not extend &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglicanism&lt;/a&gt;'s status of state church to these lands. Thus in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the monarch is the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; and also the leader of the state church in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Crown%20dependencies\"&gt;Crown dependencies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Leader%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Supreme Leader of Iran&lt;/a&gt; is elected for life by a body consisting of senior &lt;a href=\"Twelver\"&gt;Twelver&lt;/a&gt; clerics. The supreme leader, known as an &lt;a href=\"ayatollah\"&gt;ayatollah&lt;/a&gt;, is the spiritual leader of the country as well as a powerful political figure with wide-ranging powers and his own military force.\nIn the past, &lt;a href=\"Tibet%20%281912%E2%80%931951%29\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Dalai%20Lama\"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;s, political leaders who were symbolic religious leaders but had no formal position in religious organisations, so not being sacerdotal.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; ecclesiastical principality that existed from 1516 until 1852 in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s rule over the most of the region."
