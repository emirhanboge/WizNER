    "text": "Grey or gray (&lt;a href=\"American%20English\"&gt;American English&lt;/a&gt; alternative; &lt;a href=\"American%20and%20British%20English%20spelling%20differences%23Miscellaneous%20spelling%20differences\"&gt;see spelling differences&lt;/a&gt;) is an &lt;a href=\"intermediate%20color\"&gt;intermediate color&lt;/a&gt; between black and white. It is a neutral color or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is a color \"without color\", because it can be composed of black and white. It is the color of a cloud-covered sky, of &lt;a href=\"wood%20ash\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt; and of lead.\nThe first recorded use of \"grey\" as a color name in the English language was in 700\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;CE&lt;/a&gt;. \"Grey\" is the dominant spelling in &lt;a href=\"English%20language%20in%20Europe\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20English\"&gt;Commonwealth English&lt;/a&gt;, although \"gray\" remained in common usage in the UK until the second half of the 20th century. \"Gray\" has been the preferred American spelling since approximately 1825, although \"grey\" is an accepted variant.\nIn Europe and North America, surveys show that grey is the color most commonly associated with &lt;a href=\"Neutrality%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;neutrality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"conformity\"&gt;conformity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boredom\"&gt;boredom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"uncertainty\"&gt;uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"old%20age\"&gt;old age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apathy\"&gt;indifference&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"modesty\"&gt;modesty&lt;/a&gt;. Only one percent of respondents chose it as their &lt;a href=\"color%20preferences\"&gt;favorite color&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\n\"Grey\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt; or , from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; , and is related to the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; . The first recorded use of \"grey\" as a color name in the English language was in 700\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;CE&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn history and art.\nAntiquity through the Middle Ages.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20history\"&gt;antiquity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, grey was the color of undyed wool, and thus was the color most commonly worn by peasants and the poor. It was also the color worn by &lt;a href=\"Cistercian\"&gt;Cistercian&lt;/a&gt; monks and friars of the &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin\"&gt;Capuchin&lt;/a&gt; orders as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan friars in England and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; were commonly known as the &lt;a href=\"grey%20friars\"&gt;grey friars&lt;/a&gt;, and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.\nRenaissance and the Baroque.\nDuring the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.\nGrey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called \"&lt;a href=\"grisaille\"&gt;grisaille&lt;/a&gt;\". The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.\nGrey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of &lt;a href=\"Rembrandt%20Van%20Rijn\"&gt;Rembrandt Van Rijn&lt;/a&gt; and for many of the paintings of &lt;a href=\"El%20Greco\"&gt;El Greco&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to highlight the faces and costumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little &lt;a href=\"red%20lake\"&gt;red lake&lt;/a&gt; color from &lt;a href=\"cochineal\"&gt;cochineal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rose%20madder\"&gt;madder&lt;/a&gt;. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some &lt;a href=\"lead%20white\"&gt;lead white&lt;/a&gt;. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of &lt;a href=\"blue%20smalt\"&gt;blue smalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20ochre\"&gt;red ochre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"yellow%20lake\"&gt;yellow lake&lt;/a&gt;. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, \"an incredible subtlety of pigmentation\". The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings.\nEighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nGrey became a highly fashionable color in the 18th century, both for women's dresses and for men's waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.\nWomen's fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.\nThe clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of \"grisettes\". \"\"Gris\" or grey also meant drunk, and the name \"grisette\"\" was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.\nGrey also became a common color for military uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20Army\"&gt;Confederate Army&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and of the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Army\"&gt;Prussian Army&lt;/a&gt; for active service wear from 1910 onwards.\nSeveral artists of the mid-19th century used tones of grey to create memorable paintings; &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste-Camille%20Corot\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot&lt;/a&gt; used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and &lt;a href=\"James%20McNeill%20Whistler\"&gt;James McNeill Whistler&lt;/a&gt; created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.\nWhistler's arrangement of tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Debussy\"&gt;Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ysa%C3%BFe\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe&lt;/a&gt; describing his \"&lt;a href=\"Nocturnes%20%28Debussy%29\"&gt;Nocturnes&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"an experiment in the combinations that can be obtained from one color \u2013 what a study in grey would be in painting\".\nTwentieth and twenty-first centuries.\nIn the late 1930s, grey became a symbol of industrialization and war. It was the dominant color of &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Picasso\"&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt;'s celebrated painting about the horrors of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Guernica%20%28painting%29\"&gt;Guernica&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter the war, the grey business suit became a metaphor for uniformity of thought, popularized in such books as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20in%20the%20Gray%20Flannel%20Suit%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&lt;/a&gt;\" (1955), which became a successful film in 1956.\nIn the sciences, nature, and technology.\nStorm clouds.\nThe whiteness or darkness of clouds is a function of their depth. Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer's eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.\nStratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and grey.\nThe greying of hair.\nThe color of a person's hair is created by the pigment &lt;a href=\"melanin\"&gt;melanin&lt;/a&gt;, found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment: dark (&lt;a href=\"eumelanin\"&gt;eumelanin&lt;/a&gt;) or light (&lt;a href=\"phaeomelanin\"&gt;phaeomelanin&lt;/a&gt;). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.\nMelanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the &lt;a href=\"melanocyte\"&gt;melanocyte&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in each &lt;a href=\"hair%20follicle\"&gt;hair follicle&lt;/a&gt;, from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein &lt;a href=\"keratin\"&gt;keratin&lt;/a&gt; and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of \"Science\", a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later. According to the site of the magazine \"Scientific American\", \"Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent grey by age 50.\" Adult male gorillas also develop silver hair, but only on their backs \u2013 see &lt;a href=\"gorilla%23Characteristics\"&gt;Physical characteristics of gorillas&lt;/a&gt;.\nOptics.\nOver the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two &lt;a href=\"complementary%20colors\"&gt;complementary colors&lt;/a&gt;, such as orange and blue.\nToday the grey on televisions, computer displays, and telephones is usually created using the &lt;a href=\"RGB%20color%20model\"&gt;RGB color model&lt;/a&gt;. Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white; by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create shades of grey.\nIn printing, grey is usually obtained with the &lt;a href=\"CMYK%20color%20model\"&gt;CMYK color model&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"cyan\"&gt;cyan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magenta\"&gt;magenta&lt;/a&gt;, yellow, and black. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the &lt;a href=\"human%20eye\"&gt;human eye&lt;/a&gt; can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. Yellow, orange, and red create a \"warm grey\". Green, blue, and violet create a \"cool grey\". When no color is added, the color is \"neutral grey\", \"achromatic grey\", or simply \"grey\". Images consisting wholly of black, white and greys are called &lt;a href=\"monochrome\"&gt;monochrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black-and-white\"&gt;black-and-white&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"greyscale\"&gt;greyscale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeb colors.\nThere are several tones of grey available for use with &lt;a href=\"HTML\"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cascading%20Style%20Sheets\"&gt;Cascading Style Sheets&lt;/a&gt; (CSS) as named colors, while 254 true greys are available by specification of a &lt;a href=\"hex%20triplet\"&gt;hex triplet&lt;/a&gt; for the RGB value. All are spelled \"gray\", using the spelling \"grey\" can cause errors. This spelling was inherited from the &lt;a href=\"X11%20colour%20names\"&gt;X11 color list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Internet%20Explorer\"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Trident%20%28layout%20engine%29\"&gt;Trident browser engine&lt;/a&gt; does not recognize \"grey\" and renders it green. Another anomaly is that \"gray\" is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked \"darkgray\"; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML's \"silver\". The three \"slategray\" colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly &lt;a href=\"saturation%20%28colour%20theory%29\"&gt;saturated&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"cyan\"&gt;cyan&lt;/a&gt; (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of &lt;a href=\"saturation%20%28colour%20theory%29\"&gt;unsaturated&lt;/a&gt; tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the &lt;a href=\"midpoint\"&gt;midpoint&lt;/a&gt; in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name \"gray\" has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.\nPigments.\nUntil the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. &lt;a href=\"Rembrandt%20Van%20Rijn\"&gt;Rembrandt Van Rijn&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, usually used &lt;a href=\"lead%20white\"&gt;lead white&lt;/a&gt; and either &lt;a href=\"carbon%20black\"&gt;carbon black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ivory%20black\"&gt;ivory black&lt;/a&gt;, along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.\nIn the early 19th century, a new grey, &lt;a href=\"Payne%27s%20grey\"&gt;Payne's grey&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on the market. Payne's grey is a dark &lt;a href=\"blue-grey\"&gt;blue-grey&lt;/a&gt;, a mixture of &lt;a href=\"ultramarine\"&gt;ultramarine&lt;/a&gt; and black or of ultramarine and &lt;a href=\"sienna\"&gt;sienna&lt;/a&gt;. It is named after &lt;a href=\"William%20Payne%20%28painter%29\"&gt;William Payne&lt;/a&gt;, a British artist who painted &lt;a href=\"watercolor\"&gt;watercolor&lt;/a&gt;s in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of \"Payne's grey\" as a color name in English was in 1835.\nAnimal color.\nGrey is a very common color for animals, birds, and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.\nGrey matter of the brain.\nThe substance that composes the brain is sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=\"grey%20matter\"&gt;grey matter&lt;/a&gt;, or \"the little grey cells\", so the color grey is associated with things intellectual. However, the living human brain is actually pink in color; it only turns grey when dead.\nNanotechnology and \"grey goo\".\n&lt;a href=\"Grey%20goo\"&gt;Grey goo&lt;/a&gt; is a hypothetical &lt;a href=\"end%20of%20civilization\"&gt;end-of-the-world&lt;/a&gt; scenario, also known as &lt;a href=\"ecophagy\"&gt;ecophagy&lt;/a&gt;: out-of-control &lt;a href=\"self%20replication\"&gt;self-replicating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nanobot\"&gt;nanobot&lt;/a&gt;s consume all living matter on Earth while building more of themselves.\nGrey noise.\nIn sound engineering, &lt;a href=\"grey%20noise\"&gt;grey noise&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"random%20noise\"&gt;random noise&lt;/a&gt; subjected to a &lt;a href=\"psychoacoustic\"&gt;psychoacoustic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"equal%20loudness%20curve\"&gt;equal loudness curve&lt;/a&gt;, such as an \"inverted\" &lt;a href=\"A-weighting\"&gt;A-weighting&lt;/a&gt; curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.\nIn culture.\nReligion.\nIn the Christian religion, grey is the color of ashes, and so a &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; symbol of &lt;a href=\"mourning\"&gt;mourning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"repentance\"&gt;repentance&lt;/a&gt;, described as &lt;a href=\"mortification%20of%20the%20flesh\"&gt;sackcloth and ashes&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used during &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt; or on special days of &lt;a href=\"fasting\"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; and prayer. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by friars of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin\"&gt;Order of Friars Minor Capuchin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franciscan%20order\"&gt;Franciscan order&lt;/a&gt; as well as monks of the &lt;a href=\"Cistercian%20order\"&gt;Cistercian order&lt;/a&gt;. Grey cassocks are worn by clergy of the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Catholic%20Apostolic%20Church\"&gt;Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.\n&lt;a href=\"Taoist\"&gt;Taoist&lt;/a&gt; priests in China also often wear grey.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Paganism\"&gt;Paganism&lt;/a&gt;, grey is a symbol of stability, contemplation, neutrality, and reserving oneself. It can be used in place of any color just like white, and can bind and banish things just like black.\nPolitics.\nGrey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision. An example of a political party using grey as a color are the German &lt;a href=\"The%20Greys%20%E2%80%93%20Grey%20Panthers\"&gt;Grey Panthers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"grey power\" or \"the grey vote\" is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as &lt;a href=\"Social%20Security%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Greys\" is a term sometimes used pejoratively by environmentalists in the &lt;a href=\"green%20movement\"&gt;green movement&lt;/a&gt; to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.\nMilitary.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20Army\"&gt;Confederate Army&lt;/a&gt; wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, the armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standardizing the army uniform and establishing &lt;a href=\"cadet%20grey\"&gt;cadet grey&lt;/a&gt; as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;United States Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; at West Point, and cadets at the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Military%20Institute\"&gt;Virginia Military Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which produced many officers for the Confederacy.\nThe new uniforms were designed by &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Marschall\"&gt;Nicola Marschall&lt;/a&gt;, a German-American artist, who also designed the original &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20flag\"&gt;Confederate flag&lt;/a&gt;. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms. Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this benefit was not appreciated for several more decades. The South lacked a major dye industry, though, and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from &lt;a href=\"sumac\"&gt;sumac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"logwood\"&gt;logwood&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of &lt;a href=\"butternut%20squash\"&gt;butternut squash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. The color chosen was a grey-green called &lt;a href=\"feldgrau\"&gt;field grey&lt;/a&gt; (). It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20blue\"&gt;Prussian blue&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its &lt;a href=\"camouflage\"&gt;camouflage&lt;/a&gt; value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers. The &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Army\"&gt;Finnish Army&lt;/a&gt; also began using grey uniforms on the German model.\nSome of the more recent uniforms of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20German%20Army\"&gt;East German Army&lt;/a&gt; were field grey, as were some uniforms of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20army\"&gt;Swedish army&lt;/a&gt;. The formal dress (M/83) of the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Army\"&gt;Finnish Army&lt;/a&gt; is grey. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Army of Chile&lt;/a&gt; wears field grey today.\nThe grey suit.\nDuring the 19th century, women's fashions were largely dictated by Paris, while London set fashions for men. The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one's position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men's fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey &lt;a href=\"frock%20coat\"&gt;frock coat&lt;/a&gt; in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the &lt;a href=\"lounge%20suit\"&gt;lounge suit&lt;/a&gt;, a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey. In the 1930s the English suit style was called the &lt;a href=\"drape%20suit\"&gt;drape suit&lt;/a&gt;, with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.\nAssociations and symbolism.\nIn America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, \"grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither &lt;a href=\"materials%20science\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spirituality\"&gt;spiritual&lt;/a&gt;. With grey, nothing seems to be decided.\" It also denotes undefinedness, as in a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Agrey%20area\"&gt;grey area&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called \"The Grey Lady\" because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.\nGrey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty."
