He worked as an English teacher for many years, then a &lt;a href=\"reporter\"&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt; and a journalist in English newspapers and &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;s in the gulf region.

These websites defended women in front of men in order not to be forced to marriage. According to the writer, the objection of men to marriage because of &lt;a href=\"Finance\"&gt;financial&lt;/a&gt; reasons or other related to the link between the independence of a woman and her being a &lt;a href=\"spinster\"&gt;spinster&lt;/a&gt;.\nKafafi published his second story collection \u201cConfused Ant\u201d (Namulah Hayrah) in 2003 (translated into English in 2004).
