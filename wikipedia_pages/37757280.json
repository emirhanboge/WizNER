    "text": "The Hitchin Flyover is a &lt;a href=\"grade-separated\"&gt;grade-separated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"single%20track%20%28rail%29\"&gt;single-track&lt;/a&gt; railway viaduct near &lt;a href=\"Hitchin\"&gt;Hitchin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, which carries the \"Down Cambridge Flyover line\" over the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt;. Constructed between 2012 and 2013, it connects the westernmost track of the East Coast Main Line with the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20line\"&gt;Cambridge line&lt;/a&gt;. The flyover was built to increase the throughput at \"Cambridge Junction\", a congested &lt;a href=\"Level%20junction\"&gt;flat junction&lt;/a&gt;, which put severe constraints on capacity on both lines.\nHistory.\nTogether with the &lt;a href=\"Digswell%20Viaduct\"&gt;Digswell Viaduct&lt;/a&gt; some ten miles to the south, the flat junction just north of was a major &lt;a href=\"traffic%20bottleneck\"&gt;bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, as northbound trains diverging from the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt; towards Letchworth and thence to Cambridge had to cross one northbound (fast) line and two southbound (fast and slow) lines to access the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20Line\"&gt;Cambridge Line&lt;/a&gt;. Proposals as part of the original electrification work in the early 1970s envisaged a new underpass here and land was set aside for its construction. However, budgetary constraints forced this part of the programme to be abandoned. The land stood empty for many years, but has since been used to provide new housing.\nA new plan\nand subsequent application for an order\nto build a flyover was approved after a &lt;a href=\"Planning%20Inspectorate\"&gt;Planning Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt; report and &lt;a href=\"public%20inquiry\"&gt;public inquiry&lt;/a&gt; between 11 and 25 May 2010.\nConstruction was completed in June 2013. Original plans were to build the embankment using aggregate trucked in from elsewhere, but eventually it was decided to build up the embankment using chalk taken from the nearby Wilbury Hills, low-lying chalk hills forming part of the &lt;a href=\"Chiltern%20Hills\"&gt;Chiltern Hills&lt;/a&gt;, from less than away, removing the need for lorry movements along public roads. The chalk was quarried from just beyond the ancient &lt;a href=\"Icknield%20Way\"&gt;Icknield Way&lt;/a&gt;, which at this point is a public &lt;a href=\"bridlepath\"&gt;bridlepath&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Ickleford\"&gt;Ickleford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Letchworth%20Garden%20City\"&gt;Letchworth Garden City&lt;/a&gt;, and the contractor was required to refill and replant the quarry afterwards.\nSince the embankment materials were locally sourced it also meant that the new embankment was effectively pre-seeded with poppies. This means the entire embankment is covered in red poppies during their flowering season giving the name to the location 'Poppy Bank'.\nPresent day.\nThe scheme has created a new single-track line that diverges from the northbound slow line at \"Hitchin North Junction\" just beyond Hitchin station, using a short embankment section of the former &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20to%20Hitchin%20Line\"&gt;Bedford to Hitchin Line&lt;/a&gt;, a section of which was cleared of vegetation and made progressively higher, to form a short ramp. The track is carried over the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt; on a newly constructed viaduct and onto a new embankment to join the present &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20Line\"&gt;Cambridge Line&lt;/a&gt; at the newly created \"Hitchin East Junction\", closer to .\nAlthough this routing skirts around the flat junction in a curve that takes trains over a physically longer distance, it removes the need for them to dwell at Hitchin \u2013 sometimes for several minutes \u2013 awaiting a path across the tracks of the main London\u2013Peterborough route, thus decreasing the overall journey time to Cambridge in many instances. The scheme improves the punctuality and reliability of both the London\u2013Cambridge and London\u2013Peterborough routes, the latter because Peterborough-bound stopping trains are no longer delayed if running closely behind a Cambridge service being held at Hitchin waiting to cross the flat junction.\nThe flat junction remains in use, providing an alternative route from either the Down Fast or Down Slow line to the Cambridge line.\nOn 26 June 2013, passenger services began to use the flyover, with up to three services per day using it during regular service and driver training. The flyover came into full use in December 2013 with the introduction of the new timetable.\nThe route was designed so that all trains, even heavy freight, can use the flyover.\n Trains to Letchworth and Cambridge are timetabled to take one minute longer than in the reverse direction. For example, trains from King's Cross to Cambridge which used to leave at XX.15 now leave at XX.14.\nBy January 2015 the only form of traction not to have used the flyover was electric locomotives (regular services are &lt;a href=\"electric%20multiple%20unit\"&gt;electric multiple unit&lt;/a&gt;s); &lt;a href=\"LNER%20Class%20A4%204488%20Union%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;\"Union of South Africa\"&lt;/a&gt; became the first steam locomotive on the flyover when it moved &lt;a href=\"empty%20coaching%20stock\"&gt;empty coaching stock&lt;/a&gt; to Cambridge in preparation for a tour to York."
