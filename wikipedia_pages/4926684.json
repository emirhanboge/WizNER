The &lt;a href=\"Greensand%20Way\"&gt;Greensand Way&lt;/a&gt; runs in part through the churchyard of St James's Church in the village.\nThe northern slopes of this are two named woods.

A farmers' market is held weekly in the Millennium Hall.\nEgerton has a medium proportion of &lt;a href=\"Listed%20Building\"&gt;listed properties&lt;/a&gt; for the English countryside such as Egerton House and a &lt;a href=\"tumulus\"&gt;Saxon Burial mound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 13th-century parish &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; exists which is dedicated to the disciple of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee\"&gt;Saint James&lt;/a&gt;.
