    "text": "Melankomas, or Melancomas (), meaning 'One with the Black Hair,' was an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Caria\"&gt;Caria&lt;/a&gt; and victor in the 207th &lt;a href=\"Olympiad\"&gt;Olympiad&lt;/a&gt; (49 C.E.). \nBiography.\nMelankomas was born in Caria to an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20boxing\"&gt;Ancient Greek boxing&lt;/a&gt; champion, of the same name, who lived during the first century C.E. He made a name for himself as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; boxer in the &lt;a href=\"Olympiad\"&gt;Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;, even winning in the 207th Olympiad in 49 C.E. \nSupposedly he had a unique boxing &lt;a href=\"Martial%20arts\"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;, blocking and avoiding the punches of the other boxer without throwing any himself. Once his opponents had run out of stamina they would forfeit, leaving Melankomas the victor. It was related by &lt;a href=\"Dio%20Chrysostom\"&gt;Dio Chrysostom&lt;/a&gt; that he was able to fight like this by training significantly more than his contemporaries and having an unmatched &lt;a href=\"endurance\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt;, being able to fight through a whole day or hold his arms up, in a &lt;a href=\"static%20hold\"&gt;static hold&lt;/a&gt;, continuously for two days.\nMelankomas died young, around the year 70 C.E. during the games in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nMelankomas is known to us mainly from the 28th and 29th Discourses of \"&lt;a href=\"Dio%20Chrysostom\"&gt;Dio Chrysostom&lt;/a&gt;\", in which that writer uses his life as a canvas for a discussion of the ideal athlete and the ideal man; Dio praises his athleticism, good looks, and brave heart. Dio says he never lost a match, hit an opponent, or was struck by an opponent. &lt;a href=\"Themistius\"&gt;Themistius&lt;/a&gt; reports that the emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus\"&gt;Titus&lt;/a&gt; was his lover (\"\").\nSome scholars believe Melankomas to have been a real person, while others believe that he or his record was an invention of Dio's; there is nothing allowing a firm conclusion either way.\nMelankomas was mentioned in a second-season episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Night\"&gt;Sports Night&lt;/a&gt;\" as a contender for \"Athlete of the Millennium.\"\nExternal links.\ncaria"
