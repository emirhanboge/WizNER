    "text": "John Quigley (28 June 1935 \u2013 30 November 2004) born in the Govan area of Glasgow he was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; and coach. His career peaked when he won the &lt;a href=\"1959%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1959 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nCeltic.\nHe began his career as a provisional signing with &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;, who farmed him out to &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Scottish Junior Football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"St%20Anthony%27s%20F.C.\"&gt;St Anthony's&lt;/a&gt;.

His goal against &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Stadium\"&gt;Hillsborough&lt;/a&gt; won that &lt;a href=\"1958-59%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1958-59 FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi final. Forest were 2-0 up after 14 minutes. &lt;a href=\"Luton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Luton Town&lt;/a&gt; hit back midway through the second half after Forest's opening goalscorer &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Dwight\"&gt;Roy Dwight&lt;/a&gt; broke his leg in the 33rd minute. Forest had further personnel issue when cramp reduced &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Whare\"&gt;Bill Whare&lt;/a&gt; to little more than a hobbling spectator. Quigley helped Forest protect their 2-1 lead to lift the trophy at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;. He left Nottingham Forest in February 1965.\nHuddersfield Town and Bristol City.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt; he scored 5 goals in 68 appearances.

He made 104 appearances and scored 2 goals and also captained the side.\nOverall in his professional career he made 508 appearances and scored 72 goals.\nCoaching career.\nHe branched into coaching at Mansfield.
