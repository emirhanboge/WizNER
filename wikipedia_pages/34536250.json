    "text": "Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c ( , died 1793) was the founder of the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2y%20S%C6%A1n%20dynasty\"&gt;T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, reigning from 1778 to 1788.\nFrom 1778 to 1788, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c proclaimed himself Emperor Th\u00e1i \u0110\u1ee9c ( ). In 1788 after his younger brother proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c resigned his Emperor title and declared himself as King of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c and his brothers, namely &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20L%E1%BB%AF\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Hu%E1%BB%87\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7&lt;/a&gt;, known as the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Brothers, ended the centuries-long civil war between the two feudal families- the &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20Lords\"&gt;Tr\u1ecbnh Lords&lt;/a&gt; in northern Vietnam and the &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Lords\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Lords&lt;/a&gt; in southern Vietnam, seizing reigning power from these groups and the &lt;a href=\"L%C3%AA%20dynasty\"&gt;L\u00ea dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2y%20S%C6%A1n%20District\"&gt;T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District&lt;/a&gt;, Quy Nh\u01a1n Province (modern &lt;a href=\"B%C3%ACnh%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh%20Province\"&gt;B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province&lt;/a&gt;). Vietnamese historian &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20Tr%E1%BB%8Dng%20Kim\"&gt;Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim&lt;/a&gt; described him as a courageous and clever man. He had two younger brothers: &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20L%E1%BB%AF\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Hu%E1%BB%87\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7&lt;/a&gt;. Their talents are highly appreciated by their martial arts master, &lt;a href=\"Tr%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Hi%E1%BA%BFn\"&gt;Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Hi\u1ebfn&lt;/a&gt;. \nT\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers lived by trading &lt;a href=\"betel\"&gt;betel&lt;/a&gt;. Legend stated that Nh\u1ea1c got a magical sword from barbarians, so he was respected by many people. Later, Nh\u1ea1c became a tax-collector of &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20lord\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n lord&lt;/a&gt;. He robbed off all tax he had collected, and distributed to poor farmers. He had to flee with his brothers, and became an outlaw. Hi\u1ebfn encouraged Nh\u1ea1c to revolt against Nguy\u1ec5n lords: \"The prophecy says: 'Revolt in the West, success in the North'. You are born in T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District, you must do your best.\" Nh\u1ea1c agreed with him.\nRevolted against Nguy\u1ec5n lords.\nAt that time, the lord of &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%C3%A0ng%20Trong\"&gt;Cochinchina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ph%C3%BAc%20Thu%E1%BA%A7n\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n&lt;/a&gt; was young, the regent was a corrupted official, &lt;a href=\"Tr%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Ph%C3%BAc%20Loan\"&gt;Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Ph\u00fac Loan&lt;/a&gt;. Loan was so unpopular that people compared him with &lt;a href=\"Qin%20Hui\"&gt;Qin Hui&lt;/a&gt;. There were rumors that Loan changed the former lord's will and throned the young prince Thu\u1ea7n. In 1771, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c, Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 rebelled against Nguy\u1ec5n lord. They took &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2y%20S%C6%A1n%20District\"&gt;T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District&lt;/a&gt; as base camp, aimed to overthrow Loan and enthrone &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ph%C3%BAc%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac D\u01b0\u01a1ng&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest grandson of the former Nguy\u1ec5n lord. The rebels became famous for their policy: \"fair, no corruption, only looting the rich, and help the poor.\" Soon they were widely supported by poor people. Ethnic minorities in Cochinchina, including &lt;a href=\"Montagnard%20%28Vietnam%29\"&gt;Montagnards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chams\"&gt;Chams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hoa%20people\"&gt;Sino-Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;, also took part in the rebellion.\nThe rebels grew rapidly and government troops were unable to put down. One day, Nh\u1ea1c sat in a prison van, ordered his men to take him to &lt;a href=\"Quy%20Nh%C6%A1n\"&gt;Quy Nh\u01a1n&lt;/a&gt;. The governor, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%E1%BA%AFc%20Tuy%C3%AAn\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u1eafc Tuy\u00ean&lt;/a&gt; (\u962e\u514b\u5ba3), was very happy, and threw him into prison. At night, Nh\u1ea1c escaped from prison and opened the city gate. Quy Nh\u01a1n was taken by T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army, and used as the new base camp. Then T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army marched to &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Nam\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Nam&lt;/a&gt;, Nguy\u1ec5n army was defeated by the rebels. Nguy\u1ec5n lord sent his main forces to Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, but failed to drive the rebels out of this province.\nConflict with Tr\u1ecbnh lords.\nHearing that Cochinchina fell into chaos, &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20S%C3%A2m\"&gt;Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%C3%A0ng%20Ngo%C3%A0i\"&gt;Tonkin&lt;/a&gt;, sent &lt;a href=\"Ho%C3%A0ng%20Ng%C5%A9%20Ph%C3%BAc\"&gt;Ho\u00e0ng Ng\u0169 Ph\u00fac&lt;/a&gt; to launch attack on Nguy\u1ec5n lord using the excuse that they would help Nguy\u1ec5n lord to arrest the treacherous minister Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Ph\u00fac Loan. Tr\u1ecbnh marched south with little resistance and soon took possession of Nguy\u1ec5n's capital, &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Xu%C3%A2n\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;. Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n fled to Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, in there he designated &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ph%C3%BAc%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac D\u01b0\u01a1ng&lt;/a&gt; as crown prince. Several months later, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army took Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, Thu\u1ea7n had to flee to Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh. Not long after, from &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i%20Province\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"B%C3%ACnh%20Thu%E1%BA%ADn%20Province\"&gt;B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn&lt;/a&gt; was occupied by T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebels.\nTr\u1ecbnh army marched to Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, and came into conflict with T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army. They met in the battlefield in C\u1ea9m Sa (a place in modern &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B2a%20Vang%20District\"&gt;H\u00f2a Vang&lt;/a&gt;). Nh\u1ea1c ordered &lt;a href=\"T%E1%BA%ADp%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh\"&gt;T\u1eadp \u0110\u00ecnh&lt;/a&gt; to take the lead and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BD%20T%C3%A0i\"&gt;L\u00fd T\u00e0i&lt;/a&gt; in the middle, Nh\u1ea1c himself to bring up the rear. T\u1eadp \u0110\u00ecnh was raided by Tr\u1ecbnh cavalry and ultimately led to T\u00e2y S\u01a1n's defeat. Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c and L\u00fd T\u00e0i retreated to B\u1ebfn B\u1ea3n. Nh\u1ea1c prepared for the reception of the crown prince D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and went to Quy Nh\u01a1n together with him. In the same time, a Nguy\u1ec5n army under &lt;a href=\"T%E1%BB%91ng%20Ph%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc%20Hi%E1%BB%87p\"&gt;T\u1ed1ng Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Hi\u1ec7p&lt;/a&gt; (\u5b8b\u798f\u6d3d) resumed &lt;a href=\"B%C3%ACnh%20Thu%E1%BA%ADn%20Province\"&gt;B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Di%C3%AAn%20Kh%C3%A1nh\"&gt;Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh&lt;/a&gt; and B\u00ecnh Khang (modern &lt;a href=\"Ninh%20H%C3%B2a\"&gt;Ninh H\u00f2a&lt;/a&gt;), then recaptured &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Y%C3%AAn\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean&lt;/a&gt;. T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army fell in a &lt;a href=\"two-front%20war\"&gt;two-front war&lt;/a&gt; with both Nguy\u1ec5n lord and Tr\u1ecbnh lord. Nh\u1ea1c sent an envoy to Tr\u1ecbnh army to sue for peace. Nh\u1ea1c swore allegiance to Tr\u1ecbnh lord, in return, he received the position \"Ti\u00ean-phong-t\u01b0\u1edbng-qu\u00e2n\" and \"T\u00e2y-s\u01a1n Hi\u1ec7u-tr\u01b0\u1edfng\" from Tr\u1ecbnh lord.\nAfter concluding a peace deal with Tr\u1ecbnh lord, Nh\u1ea1c married a daughter to Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and urged him to ascend the lord throne, but D\u01b0\u01a1ng refused. Nh\u1ea1c sent a letter to T\u1ed1ng Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Hi\u1ec7p. In the letter, Nh\u1ea1c said he decided to swear allegiance to the crown prince D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and prepared to resume the capital Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n. Nh\u1ea1c then ordered &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Hu%E1%BB%87\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7&lt;/a&gt; to launch a raid on Nguy\u1ec5n army. H\u1ee3p was defeated and fled to V\u00e2n Phong.\nTr\u1ecbnh army marched to Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i, but most of soldiers died from disease, Ho\u00e0ng Ng\u0169 Ph\u00fac had to retreat. Ph\u00fac died of illness on his way back to Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n; his assistant, &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B9i%20Th%E1%BA%BF%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1t\"&gt;B\u00f9i Th\u1ebf \u0110\u1ea1t&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed as the successor. Qu\u1ea3ng Nam was reoccupied by T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army; now, Nh\u1ea1c could concentrate on fighting against Nguy\u1ec5n lord. He sent &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20L%E1%BB%AF\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef&lt;/a&gt; to the south. &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ph%C3%BAc%20Thu%E1%BA%A7n\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and fled to &lt;a href=\"Bi%C3%AAn%20H%C3%B2a\"&gt;Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstablishment of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty.\nIn 1776, Nh\u1ea1c titled himself \"T\u00e2y S\u01a1n v\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (\u897f\u5c71\u738b \"king of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n\"). He used Citadel \u0110\u1ed3 B\u00e0n (&lt;a href=\"Vijaya%20%28Champa%29\"&gt;Vijaya&lt;/a&gt;) as the capital, and appointed many officials. Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac D\u01b0\u01a1ng was imprisoned in a Buddhist temple; later, he fled to &lt;a href=\"Gia%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh\"&gt;Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh&lt;/a&gt;, there he was supported by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BD%20T%C3%A0i\"&gt;L\u00fd T\u00e0i&lt;/a&gt; and ascended the lord throne. In the next year, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c was recognized as the new ruler of Cochinchina by Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m. He received the noble rank \"Cung-qu\u1eadn-c\u00f4ng\" (\u606d\u90e1\u516c \"provincial duke Cung\") from Tr\u1ecbnh lord. T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army marched further south, finally, both Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n and Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac D\u01b0\u01a1ng were captured and executed by Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. In 1778, Nh\u1ea1c crowned the emperor, and changed &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20era%20name\"&gt;era name&lt;/a&gt; to \"Th\u00e1i \u0110\u1ee9c\" (\u6cf0\u5fb7), marking the establishment of &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2y%20S%C6%A1n%20dynasty\"&gt;T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nA nephew of Thu\u1ea7n, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20%C3%81nh\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape to &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A0%20Ti%C3%AAn\"&gt;H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean&lt;/a&gt; then to &lt;a href=\"Th%E1%BB%95%20Chu%20Island\"&gt;Poulo Panjang&lt;/a&gt;. In late 1777, the main part of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army left Saigon and marched north. Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh landed in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Xuy%C3%AAn\"&gt;Long Xuy\u00ean&lt;/a&gt;. There, he was supported by many Nguy\u1ec5n generals, and raised the flag of restoration. &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20Thanh%20Nh%C6%A1n\"&gt;\u0110\u1ed7 Thanh Nh\u01a1n&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n army, also swore allegiance to \u00c1nh. Nguy\u1ec5n army became much more stronger, and captured many places. \u00c1nh also made an alliance &lt;a href=\"Siam\"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt;. However, the assassination of \u0110\u1ed7 Thanh Nh\u01a1n by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh causing the revolt of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n army, thus badly weakening the Nguy\u1ec5n army. Taking this opportunity, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 invaded Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh and finally recaptured it in 1782. Nh\u1ea1c returned to Quy Nh\u01a1n. In the next year, &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2u%20V%C4%83n%20Ti%E1%BA%BFp\"&gt;Ch\u00e2u V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfp&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of Nguy\u1ec5n lord, defeated the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n garrison in &lt;a href=\"Saigon\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt;, and invited Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh to return. Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 were sent to Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, and forced \u00c1nh to flee to &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Qu%E1%BB%91c\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c&lt;/a&gt;. In 1785, Hu\u1ec7 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20R%E1%BA%A1ch%20G%E1%BA%A7m-Xo%C3%A0i%20M%C3%BAt\"&gt;defeated Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh and Siamese navy&lt;/a&gt;. \u00c1nh had to flee to Siam.\nNguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's overthrow of Tr\u1ecbnh lords.\nThe ruler of &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%C3%A0ng%20Ngo%C3%A0i\"&gt;Tonkin&lt;/a&gt;, Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m, died in 1782. His favorite son &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20C%C3%A1n\"&gt;Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; ascended the lord throne, but soon was deposed in a military coup. The mutinying soldiers installed &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20Kh%E1%BA%A3i\"&gt;Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3i&lt;/a&gt; as the new lord. Tonkin fell into chaos. In 1786, an army under &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Hu%E1%BB%87\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C5%A9%20V%C4%83n%20Nh%E1%BA%ADm\"&gt;V\u0169 V\u0103n Nh\u1eadm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20H%E1%BB%AFu%20Ch%E1%BB%89nh\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Ch\u1ec9nh&lt;/a&gt; marched north to attack &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Xu%C3%A2n\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;. After the capture of Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, Ch\u1ec9nh encouraged Hu\u1ec7 to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20lord\"&gt;Tr\u1ecbnh lord&lt;/a&gt;. Hu\u1ec7 took his advice, marched further north without Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c's order, and finally captured &lt;a href=\"Th%C4%83ng%20Long\"&gt;Th\u0103ng Long&lt;/a&gt;. Nh\u1ea1c did not want to take Tonkin; he sent an envoy to Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n to prevent Hu\u1ec7 from marching north, but Hu\u1ec7 had left. Then he got the message that Hu\u1ec7 had captured Th\u0103ng Long, and realized that Hu\u1ec7 was hard to be controlled. Nh\u1ea1c led 2500 men and marched north to meet with Hu\u1ec7 and the &lt;a href=\"L%C3%AA%20Chi%C3%AAu%20Th%E1%BB%91ng\"&gt;L\u00ea emperor&lt;/a&gt;. In Th\u0103ng Long, Nh\u1ea1c promised that he would not take any territory of Tonkin. Then he retreated from Tonkin together with Hu\u1ec7. Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c proclaimed himself as \"Trung \u01b0\u01a1ng Ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u7687\u5e1d \"the Central Emperor\"). Nguy\u1ec5n L\u1eef was given the title \"\u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ecbnh v\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (\u6771\u5b9a\u738b \"King of Eastern Conquering\"), Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was his fief; Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 received the title \"B\u1eafc B\u00ecnh V\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (\u5317\u5e73\u738b \"King of Northern Conquering\") and lived in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, the area north to &lt;a href=\"H%E1%BA%A3i%20V%C3%A2n%20Pass\"&gt;H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt; was his fief.\nCivil war between two brothers.\nNot long after, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c came into conflict with Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. A civil war broke out, Hu\u1ec7 besieged Quy Nh\u01a1n for several months. The main forces of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was called back to support Nh\u1ea1c, but was defeated in &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Y%C3%AAn\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean&lt;/a&gt;, its commander &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%E1%BA%B7ng%20V%C4%83n%20Ch%C3%A2n\"&gt;\u0110\u1eb7ng V\u0103n Ch\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt; surrendered to Hu\u1ec7. Nh\u1ea1c climbed onto the city wall, and shouted to Hu\u1ec7: \"How can you use the pot of skin to cook meat like that?\". It is an old custom, if hunters seized a prey in the jungle without a pot, they would flay it and use its skin to cook meat. Using this metaphor, Nh\u1ea1c indicated that brothers should not fight with each other. Hu\u1ec7 was moved to tears, and decided to retreat, and reached a peace agreement Nh\u1ea1c. They chose B\u1ebfn B\u1ea3n as a boundary; the area north to &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i&lt;/a&gt; was Hu\u1ec7's area; the area south to &lt;a href=\"Th%C4%83ng%20B%C3%ACnh%20District\"&gt;Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C4%90i%E1%BB%87n%20B%C3%A0n%20District\"&gt;\u0110i\u1ec7n B\u00e0n&lt;/a&gt; belonged to Nh\u1ea1c. From then on, they ceased fire with each other.\nFinal years.\nLater, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 marched north and put down the rebellion in Tonkin. Hu\u1ec7 proclaimed himself as Emperor Quang Trung in 1788, and defeated &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing&lt;/a&gt; army in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20H%E1%BB%93i-%C4%90%E1%BB%91ng%20%C4%90a\"&gt;Battle of Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ed3i-\u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the civil war of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers had provided Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh with the chance to go back to Cochinchina again. Nh\u1ea1c's territory was eroded by Nguy\u1ec5n lord. During his final years, he only controlled three provinces: Quy Nh\u01a1n (modern &lt;a href=\"B%C3%ACnh%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh%20Province\"&gt;B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i%20Province\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%BA%20Y%C3%AAn%20Province\"&gt;Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean&lt;/a&gt;. He was described as \"an old man who is resigned to the present state of affairs\" by Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. Hu\u1ec7 was also worried about the future of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty.\nNguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 suddenly died in 1792. Nh\u1ea1c prepared to attend Hu\u1ec7's funeral, however, the road to Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n was blocked by the successor &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Quang%20To%E1%BA%A3n\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n&lt;/a&gt;, he had to return, and sent a sister to attend the funeral. In the next year, Quy Nh\u01a1n was attacked by Nguy\u1ec5n lord. When Nguy\u1ec5n navy reached &lt;a href=\"Th%E1%BB%8B%20N%E1%BA%A1i%20Port\"&gt;Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i Port&lt;/a&gt;, Nh\u1ea1c ordered his crown prince &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20B%E1%BA%A3o\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n B\u1ea3o&lt;/a&gt; to fight against them. T\u00e2y S\u01a1n navy suffered from a double-pronged attack, B\u1ea3o was defeated by &lt;a href=\"T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20H%E1%BB%99i\"&gt;T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t H\u1ed9i&lt;/a&gt; (\u5c0a\u5ba4\u6703), &lt;a href=\"V%C3%B5%20T%C3%ADnh\"&gt;V\u00f5 T\u00ednh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Hu%E1%BB%B3nh%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ef3nh \u0110\u1ee9c&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Th%C3%A0nh\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Th\u00e0nh&lt;/a&gt;, and fled back to Quy Nh\u01a1n. Nh\u1ea1c had to ask for Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n's help. 17,000 men under &lt;a href=\"Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20C%C3%B4ng%20H%C6%B0ng\"&gt;Ph\u1ea1m C\u00f4ng H\u01b0ng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ng%C3%B4%20V%C4%83n%20S%E1%BB%9F\"&gt;Ng\u00f4 V\u0103n S\u1edf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Hu%E1%BA%A5n\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hu\u1ea5n&lt;/a&gt; (\u962e\u6587\u8a13) and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%AA%20Trung\"&gt;L\u00ea Trung&lt;/a&gt; (\u9ece\u5fe0) marched south to reinforce Quy Nh\u01a1n. A navy led by &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%E1%BA%B7ng%20V%C4%83n%20Ch%C3%A2n\"&gt;\u0110\u1eb7ng V\u0103n Ch\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt; was also sent there in the same time. Nguy\u1ec5n army had to retreat. H\u01b0ng marched into the city, claiming that the emperor of Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n had taken over it. Nh\u1ea1c was angry, and died soon after suffering from vomiting blood.\nThe fate of his offspring.\nNh\u1ea1c's eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20B%E1%BA%A3o\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n B\u1ea3o&lt;/a&gt;, was stripped off the position, and granted the title \"Hi\u1ebfu c\u00f4ng\" (\u5b5d\u516c, \"Duke of filial piety\") by Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n. The territory of Nh\u1ea1c was annexed by To\u1ea3n, B\u1ea3o only received Ph\u00f9 Ly (modern &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%B9%20M%E1%BB%B9%20District\"&gt;Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%B9%20C%C3%A1t%20District\"&gt;Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t&lt;/a&gt;) as his fief. In 1798, B\u1ea3o launched an unsuccessful rebellion against To\u1ea3n, and was executed.\nT\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty was overthrown by Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh in 1802. Nh\u1ea1c's three sons, Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh (\u962e\u6e05), Nguy\u1ec5n H\u00e2n (\u962e\u6615) and Nguy\u1ec5n D\u0169ng (\u962e\u52c7), were executed together with Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n and other princes of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty. The tombs of Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 were razed to the ground, their remains were dug out and crushed into ashes. The skulls of Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 and Hu\u1ec7's wife, were locked up in prison in perpetuity. It was said that Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 had desecrated the tombs of Nguy\u1ec5n lords before, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh did that to \"revenge for the ancestors\" (&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3A%E4%B9%9D%E4%B8%96%E4%B9%8B%E4%BB%87\"&gt;\u7232\u4e5d\u4e16\u800c\u5fa9\u8b8e&lt;/a&gt;).\nTwo other sons, Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c (\u962e\u6587\u5fb7), Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n L\u01b0\u01a1ng (\u962e\u6587\u826f), and grandson Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u00e2u (\u962e\u6587\u515c, son of Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c) escaped, they hid in countryside secretly. In 1831, they were found by &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20dynasty\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and executed by &lt;a href=\"waist%20chop\"&gt;waist chop&lt;/a&gt;."
