    "text": "USCGC \"Point White\" (WPB-82308) was an &lt;a href=\"Point%20class%20cutter\"&gt;Point class cutter&lt;/a&gt; constructed at the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Yard\"&gt;Coast Guard Yard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Bay%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Curtis Bay, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Cutter\"&gt;cutters&lt;/a&gt; under in length, it was designated as \"WPB-82308\" when commissioned and acquired the name \"Point White\" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .\nConstruction and design details.\n\"Point White\" was built to accommodate an 8-man crew. She was powered by two VT600 &lt;a href=\"Cummins\"&gt;Cummins&lt;/a&gt; diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.\nThe design specifications for \"Point White\" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer &lt;a href=\"Watch%20system\"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;screw&lt;/a&gt;s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a &lt;a href=\"ship%20floodability\"&gt;watertight door&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"starboard%20side\"&gt;starboard side&lt;/a&gt; aft of the &lt;a href=\"deckhouse\"&gt;deckhouse&lt;/a&gt;. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, &lt;a href=\"scuttlebutt\"&gt;scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;, a small desk and &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mess\"&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt; and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess &lt;a href=\"Bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt; led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.\nHistory.\nAfter delivery in 1961, \"Point White\" was assigned a homeport of &lt;a href=\"New%20London%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;New London, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.\nAt the request of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in &lt;a href=\"South%20Vietnam\"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and assigned to &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Squadron%20One\"&gt;Coast Guard Squadron One&lt;/a&gt; in support of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Market%20Time\"&gt;Operation Market Time&lt;/a&gt; along with 8 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Island\"&gt;Coast Guard Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parks%20Reserve%20Forces%20Training%20Area\"&gt;Camp Parks, California&lt;/a&gt;, \"Point White\" was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to &lt;a href=\"Subic%20Bay\"&gt;Subic Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 &lt;a href=\"M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun\"&gt;M2 machine guns&lt;/a&gt;. The original &lt;a href=\"Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon\"&gt;Oerlikon 20 mm cannon&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.\n\"Point White\" was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Lo%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;Cat Lo Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Vung%20Tau\"&gt;Vung Tau&lt;/a&gt;, along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the &lt;a href=\"Rung%20Sat%20Special%20Zone\"&gt;Rung Sat Special Zone&lt;/a&gt;. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board.\nOn the night of 9 March 1966 \"Point White\" was patrolling the &lt;a href=\"So%C3%A0i%20R%E1%BA%A1p%20River\"&gt;So\u00e0i R\u1ea1p River&lt;/a&gt; in the Rung Sat Special Zone and surprised a &lt;a href=\"Viet%20Cong\"&gt;Viet Cong&lt;/a&gt; (VC) junk crossing the river. Upon receiving machine gun fire from the junk, \"Point White\" returned fire and rammed the junk, causing it to explode and partially sinking it. After rescuing four of the VC crew from drowning, it was determined that one of the survivors was the commanding officer of the local training camp. After recovering from extensive burns the man later provided valuable intelligence about VC operations in the Rung Sat.\nWhile assisting with the refloating of two Navy &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Craft%20Fast\"&gt;Patrol Craft Fast&lt;/a&gt; (PCFs) that were aground near &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A0%20Ti%C3%AAn\"&gt;H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of \"Point White\" repaired an evaporator used for the fresh water supply at the Navy base at H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean\nAs a part of the &lt;a href=\"Vietnamization\"&gt;Vietnamization&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Navy\"&gt;Republic of Vietnam Navy&lt;/a&gt; (RVNN) crewmen were assigned to the cutter for training purposes beginning in February 1969. After the crew of \"Point White\" trained an RVNN replacement crew, she was turned over to the RVNN and recommissioned as RVNS \"L\u00ea \u0110\u00ecnh H\u00f9ng\" (HQ-708), 12 January 1970."
