    "text": "Devaris \"Dee\" Strange-Gordon (born April 22, 1988) is an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"center%20fielder\"&gt;center fielder&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; organization. He has played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Marlins\"&gt;Miami Marlins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt;. With the Dodgers, Strange-Gordon was primarily a shortstop and second baseman, and with the Marlins, he was primarily a second baseman. He began his tenure with the Mariners by playing center field in 2018, and started playing &lt;a href=\"left%20field\"&gt;left field&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. In 2015, in his first season with the Marlins, Strange-Gordon hit .333 with a total of 205 hits and stole 58 bases. He led the NL in all three categories and became the first player to lead the National League in both batting average and stolen bases since fellow second baseman &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\"&gt;Jackie Robinson&lt;/a&gt; in 1949. Through the 2010s, Strange-Gordon stole 330 bases, the most of any player.\nOn April 29, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; suspended Strange-Gordon for 80 games due to &lt;a href=\"performance-enhancing%20drug\"&gt;performance-enhancing drug&lt;/a&gt; use. He tested positive for exogenous &lt;a href=\"testosterone%20%28medication%29\"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clostebol\"&gt;clostebol&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nStrange-Gordon was born in &lt;a href=\"Windermere%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Windermere, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, the son of former &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) pitcher &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Gordon\"&gt;Tom Gordon&lt;/a&gt; and Devona Denise Strange. His parents were high-school sweethearts but did not marry; Tom had relationships with three other women as well and had a total of five children, all in Florida. Dee is his second-oldest. When Dee was seven years old in 1995, his mother Devona was shot to death by a subsequent boyfriend who claimed that she was shot as they played with a loaded gun. The boyfriend pleaded no contest to manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in prison. Tom Gordon sued for custody of Dee and raised him with the help of his own mother, Dee's grandmother.\nStrange-Gordon's full name is Devaris Strange-Gordon. Friends and family call him Varis. He was known professionally by his full name until 2008 when a &lt;a href=\"Missoula%20Osprey\"&gt;Missoula Osprey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"public%20address\"&gt;public address&lt;/a&gt; announcer mispronounced his first and last names. He thereafter chose to be known professionally simply as Dee Gordon. In 2020, he stated that he would like to return to being known by his legal surname professionally, to honor his mother.\nBaseball career.\nAmateur career.\nThough his father was a baseball player, Strange-Gordon initially focused on basketball and did not play baseball until he was in high school. He received a scholarship offer to play &lt;a href=\"college%20basketball\"&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Cardinals%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Louisville Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;.\nGordon played baseball at &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Park%20High%20School\"&gt;Avon Park High School&lt;/a&gt; (like his father), &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20State%20College%20of%20Florida\"&gt;Seminole Community College&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20University%20%28Florida%29\"&gt;Southeastern University&lt;/a&gt;, all in central Florida. He was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft\"&gt;2008 Major League Baseball Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 2008, with the &lt;a href=\"Ogden%20Raptors\"&gt;Ogden Raptors&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pioneer%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Pioneer League&lt;/a&gt;, he hit .331 in 60 games. With the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Loons\"&gt;Great Lakes Loons&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, Gordon hit .301 and stole 73 bases. He appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Midwest%20League\"&gt;Midwest League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, was named the league's &lt;a href=\"most%20valuable%20player\"&gt;most valuable player&lt;/a&gt;, selected to its mid-season and post-season All-Star teams, and selected as its \"Prospect of the year\". The Dodgers also selected him as their \"Minor League Player of the Year\".\nIn 2010, he was with the &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%20Lookouts\"&gt;Chattanooga Lookouts&lt;/a&gt; in the Double-A &lt;a href=\"Southern%20League%20%281964%E2%80%932020%29\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; and was selected to represent the Lookouts in the All-Star game but was unable to play because he was also selected to the &lt;a href=\"All-Star%20Futures%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Futures Game&lt;/a&gt;. He hit .277 in 133 games in 2010, while stealing 53 bases and committing 37 errors. He played for &lt;a href=\"Gigantes%20de%20Carolina%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Gigantes de Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Puerto Rico Baseball League&lt;/a&gt; after the season. He was assigned to the AAA &lt;a href=\"Albuquerque%20Isotopes\"&gt;Albuquerque Isotopes&lt;/a&gt; at the start of 2011.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nAt the start of 2011, Gordon was the Dodgers' best prospect according to \"&lt;a href=\"Baseball%20America\"&gt;Baseball America&lt;/a&gt;\". After an injury to shortstop &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Furcal\"&gt;Rafael Furcal&lt;/a&gt;, the Dodgers purchased Gordon's contract on June 6, 2011, and he made his major league debut in the top of the ninth as a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20runner\"&gt;pinch runner&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; that night, and scored a run. His father was in attendance. The next day, in his first start, he had hits in his first three major league at bats and had a stolen base. In a game against the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, Gordon stole second, third, and home in the same inning. He became the first Dodger player since &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Hendrick\"&gt;Harvey Hendrick&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1928%20Brooklyn%20Robins%20season\"&gt;1928&lt;/a&gt; and the first Major Leaguer since &lt;a href=\"Jayson%20Werth\"&gt;Jayson Werth&lt;/a&gt; on May 12, &lt;a href=\"2009%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish that feat. Gordon appeared in 56 games for the Dodgers, hitting .304 with 24 stolen bases. He also stole 30 bases for the Isotopes, giving him a total of 54 between the majors and the minors in 2011. In just 56 games for the Dodgers, Gordon's 24 stolen bases were tied for the most by a rookie during the 2011 season. He was selected to the &lt;a href=\"Topps%20All-Star%20Rookie%20Rosters\"&gt;Topps All-Star Rookie team&lt;/a&gt;.\nGordon hit his first career home run on May 1, 2012, leading off the game against &lt;a href=\"Jhoulys%20Chac%C3%ADn\"&gt;Jhoulys Chac\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;. On June 1, 2012, Gordon was part of a Dodgers lineup that featured the sons of five former Major Leaguers (along with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Gwynn%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Tony Gwynn, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iv%C3%A1n%20DeJes%C3%BAs%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Hairston%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Jerry Hairston, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Van%20Slyke\"&gt;Scott Van Slyke&lt;/a&gt;). This was the first time in Major League history that this had occurred. It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; Van Slyke, &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt; Hairston, &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt; De Jesus and &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; Gordon. Gordon was leading the league in stolen bases when he tore the &lt;a href=\"Ulnar%20collateral%20ligament%20of%20thumb\"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt; in his right thumb on a successful steal of third base on July 4 against the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;. He did not rejoin the club until September 11, by which time the club had acquired &lt;a href=\"Hanley%20Ram%C3%ADrez\"&gt;Hanley Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt; to play shortstop. With his starting spot gone, Gordon was relegated to a pinch running role the remainder of the season. Overall, in 2012, he played in 87 games and hit .228 with 32 steals. After the season, he played for the &lt;a href=\"Tigres%20del%20Licey\"&gt;Tigres del Licey&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Professional%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Dominican Winter League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe began 2013 back in AAA with the Isotopes and was called up to the Dodgers on May 4 after an injury to Ram\u00edrez. He played in 19 games, during which he hit a poor .175, and was optioned back to AAA. He rejoined the Dodgers late in the season and was used primarily as a pinch runner. He stole 10 bases in 12 attempts for the Dodgers in 2013 while hitting .231 in 38 games. Later in the season, the Isotopes started playing Gordon at &lt;a href=\"second%20base\"&gt;second base&lt;/a&gt; and he played &lt;a href=\"Center%20fielder\"&gt;center field&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Winter%20League\"&gt;Dominican Winter League&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to improve his versatility.\nGordon beat out &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Guerrero%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Alex Guerrero&lt;/a&gt; to become the Dodgers starting second baseman for the 2014 season. He hit .301 in the first half of the season, while leading the league in triples (9) and steals (42) and he was selected to the National League squad at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. At the All-Star game at &lt;a href=\"Target%20Field\"&gt;Target Field&lt;/a&gt;, when Gordon was in the on-deck circle, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Jeter\"&gt;Derek Jeter&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; TV commentators how amazing it was to see Dee there, also playing as an All-Star, having first met him at age 15 when his father Tom was then pitching for the Yankees. Gordon had entered the game as a pinch-runner in the fourth inning, and scored the game-tying run. Overall, he went 0\u20131, but made a strong fielding play at second base, sliding to his right to grab a ground ball to end the sixth inning.\nGordon finished the 2014 season with 64 stolen bases, the most in &lt;a href=\"2014%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time a Dodgers player had led the Major League in stolen bases since &lt;a href=\"Davey%20Lopes\"&gt;Davey Lopes&lt;/a&gt; stole 77 bases in 1975. He hit .289 in over 600 at-bats and also led the league with 12 triples. He was selected as a \"&lt;a href=\"Sporting%20News\"&gt;Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\" National League all-star.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 10, 2014, Gordon was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Marlins\"&gt;Miami Marlins&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Haren\"&gt;Dan Haren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Rojas%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Miguel Rojas&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Heaney\"&gt;Andrew Heaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Hatcher%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Chris Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Barnes\"&gt;Austin Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;. Gordon recorded his 50th hit of the season in the Marlins' 28th game on May 7, 2015, tying &lt;a href=\"Rogers%20Hornsby\"&gt;Rogers Hornsby&lt;/a&gt;'s 1924 Major League record for fewest team games required to reach 50 hits. After 28 games, Gordon led the major leagues with a .437 batting average. On May 22, Gordon stole four bases in a game against the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;. In a June 30 home game against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;, Gordon hit his first &lt;a href=\"inside-the-park%20home%20run\"&gt;inside-the-park home run&lt;/a&gt;. The home run against pitcher &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Vogelsong\"&gt;Ryan Vogelsong&lt;/a&gt; scored three runs. It was also the first inside-the-park homer at &lt;a href=\"Marlins%20Park\"&gt;Marlins Park&lt;/a&gt;. Gordon batted .333 for the season, winning the National League &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions\"&gt;batting title&lt;/a&gt; and leading the majors in &lt;a href=\"infield%20hit\"&gt;infield hit&lt;/a&gt;s (36) and &lt;a href=\"Bunt%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;bunt hit&lt;/a&gt;s (16), and winning his first &lt;a href=\"Rawlings%20Gold%20Glove%20Award\"&gt;Rawlings Gold Glove Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn January 18, 2016, Gordon signed a five-year contract extension with the Marlins worth $50 million. On April 29, &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; suspended Gordon for 80 games due to &lt;a href=\"performance-enhancing%20drugs\"&gt;performance-enhancing drugs&lt;/a&gt; use. He tested positive for exogenous &lt;a href=\"testosterone%20%28medication%29\"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clostebol\"&gt;clostebol&lt;/a&gt;. On September 26, the day after teammate &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; died in a boating accident, Gordon led off the game versus the Mets. A left handed hitter, he took the first pitch of his at bat as a right-handed batter, imitating Fern\u00e1ndez's batting stance, with Fern\u00e1ndez's batting helmet in honor of his late friend. Gordon then switched to bat left handed as he does naturally and hit his first home run of the year. He rounded the bases fighting off tears and hugged teammates upon his arrival back to the dugout. He said after the game that he had never hit a ball that far even in batting practice, adding, \"If y'all don't believe in God, y'all might as well start. For that to happen today, we had some help.\" Gordon's tribute home run to Fern\u00e1ndez has been described as a \"transcendent MLB moment.\"\nIn 2016 he batted .268/.305/.335 with one home run. For the season, he had the highest &lt;a href=\"ground%20ball\"&gt;ground ball&lt;/a&gt; percentage (57.6%), and the lowest &lt;a href=\"Fly%20ball%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;fly ball&lt;/a&gt; percentage (19.6%), of all major league hitters.\nIn 2017, he batted .308/.341/.375 with two home runs, and led the majors in &lt;a href=\"Bunt%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;bunt hit&lt;/a&gt;s, with 18.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn December 7, 2017, the Marlins traded Gordon and international slot money to the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Neidert\"&gt;Nick Neidert&lt;/a&gt;, Christopher Torres, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Dugger\"&gt;Robert Dugger&lt;/a&gt;. It was also reported that Gordon would be an &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; for the Mariners. Gordon played outfield for the Mariners until &lt;a href=\"Robinson%20Can%C3%B3\"&gt;Robinson Can\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; was suspended for 80 games, at which point Gordon returned to second base.\nIn September 2018, a day after Gordon nonchalantly dropped a fly ball in the outfield, he was criticized by and fought teammate &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Segura\"&gt;Jean Segura&lt;/a&gt; in the team's locker room after asking media to leave the room. For the 2018 season Gordon batted .268/.288/.349 with four home runs in 556 at bats. Center fielders set up on average only 302 feet from home plate when he came to bat and left fielders 267 feet from home plate, closer than for any other major league hitter. While he stole 30 bases (fifth in the league), he led the American League with 12 times caught stealing. On defense his 10 errors at second base were third among all AL second basemen, and his .963 fielding percentage in center field was the lowest among all major league center fielders with at least 400 innings played. Gordon walked in 1.5% of his at bats, the lowest percentage in the major leagues, and had the lowest walks-per-strikeout ratio in the majors (0.11).\nIn 2019, Gordon batted .275/.304/.359 and stole 22 bases in 117 games.\nIn 2020, he batted .200/.268/.213 and stole three bases in 33 games. As an &lt;a href=\"utility%20player\"&gt;utility player&lt;/a&gt;, he split time equally between second base and left field (13 games each), with three appearances at shortstop, and served as a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20runner\"&gt;pinch runner&lt;/a&gt; in seven games. He had the fastest average time from home plate to first base of all major league second basemen, at 4.18 seconds.\nOn October 27, 2020, it was reported that the Mariners would not pick up Strange-Gordon's $14 million contract option for the season, instead paying him a $1 million &lt;a href=\"buyout\"&gt;buyout&lt;/a&gt;. The following day, the Mariners officially declined his option, making him a free agent.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn February 7, 2021, Strange-Gordon signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; organization. On March 26, 2021, Strange-Gordon was released by the Reds.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn April 8, 2021, Strange-Gordon signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; organization. He hit .333 with 1 home run in 10 games for the Triple-A &lt;a href=\"Nashville%20Sounds\"&gt;Nashville Sounds&lt;/a&gt; before being released by Milwaukee on May 22.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn May 26, 2021, Strange-Gordon signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; organization and was assigned to the Triple-A &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Cubs\"&gt;Iowa Cubs&lt;/a&gt;. In 27 games with Iowa, he batted .223/.270/.310 with 1 home run and 9 RBI. On July 6, Strange-Gordon opted out of his minor league deal and elected free agency.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn July 7, 2021, Strange-Gordon signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; organization.\nOn August 1, Strange-Gordon opted out of his contract.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn December 11, 2021, Strange-Gordon signed a minor league contract with the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nDee's half-brother, &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Gordon\"&gt;Nick Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, was drafted by the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; in the first round (#5) of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft\"&gt;2014 draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nGordon is involved with many charities, such as Above .500 Inc. where he hosted Meet &amp; Greets and participated in multiple charity games. In addition, Gordon created \"Flash of Hope\", a charity to help children whose parent died as a result of domestic abuse. Working with the Florida District Attorney's office, he invites one child a month to join him in the clubhouse and during batting practice.\nIn 2017, Gordon was the Marlins nominee for the &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente%20Award\"&gt;Roberto Clemente Award&lt;/a&gt; after his work with Athletes Brand and Food for the Hungry in their efforts to end poverty in the Dominican Republic.\nIn 2020, he announced that he changed his last name from Gordon to Strange-Gordon to honor his late mother, DeVona Denise Strange. His mother was shot and killed when he was just seven years old."
