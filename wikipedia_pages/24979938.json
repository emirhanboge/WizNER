He first established a headquarters in the &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"Herlev\"&gt;Herlev&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1960, became the first Catholic priest to settle in Greenland since the &lt;a href=\"Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBishop of Stockholm.\nOn July 2, 1962, Taylor was appointed &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Stockholm\"&gt;Bishop of Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20XXIII\"&gt;Pope John XXIII&lt;/a&gt;.
