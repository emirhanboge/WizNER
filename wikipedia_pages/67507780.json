    "text": "Alev Erisir is a Turkish-American &lt;a href=\"neuroscientist\"&gt;neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt;. She is a Professor of Psychology and the Department Chair at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Charlottesville&lt;/a&gt;. Her primary research areas include synaptic connectivity in the visual and taste systems, neuronal circuit &lt;a href=\"Neuroplasticity\"&gt;plasticity&lt;/a&gt;, and ultrastructural &lt;a href=\"neuroanatomy\"&gt;neuroanatomy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nErisir was born in &lt;a href=\"Kastamonu\"&gt;Kastamonu&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey. Her father was stationed in Kastamonu as a malaria eradication doctor. As an infant, Erisir moved with her family to &lt;a href=\"%C3%87anakkale\"&gt;Canakkale&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey, where she grew up until the age of 11. The family then moved to &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey, where Erisir completed her secondary education. In 1986, following high school graduation, Erisir attended &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20University\"&gt;Istanbul University&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine and received her MD. In 1996, Erisir graduated from the &lt;a href=\"State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20Stony%20Brook\"&gt;State University of New York at Stony Brook&lt;/a&gt; with a PhD in &lt;a href=\"Behavioral%20neuroscience\"&gt;Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.\nResearch and career.\nErisir completed postdoctoral training at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; (NYU) &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Neural%20Science\"&gt;Center for Neural Science&lt;/a&gt;. She completed her training under the guidance of Chiye Aoki. In Aoki's laboratory, Professor Erisir trained specifically in Electron Microscopy. After completing her training at NYU, Erisir completed a one-year postdoctoral appointment at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Medical%20College\"&gt;New York Medical College&lt;/a&gt; (NYMC)\u00a0 in the department of Physiology. Following her time at NYMC, Erisir returned to NYU this time as a Research Assistant Professor.\nIn 2000, Erisir started working at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; (UVA) as an assistant professor. In 2013, she was granted professor status at UVA. During her time at UVA, Erisir has served in several administrative roles, including co-director of the neuroscience graduate program, director of the cognitive science program, and director of the neuroscience undergraduate program. In 2016, she was appointed to be the chair of the psychology department at UVA.\nAt UVA, Erisir's research has consisted of investigating ocular dominance column plasticity using several different techniques, brain stem gustatory circuitry, the aging brain and its pathology, and three-dimensional connectomics.\nErisir conducts studies on cellular mechanisms within the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases such as &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Her work examines the relationship between hyperactive &lt;a href=\"oligodendrocyte\"&gt;oligodendrocyte&lt;/a&gt;s and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's mouse models. Additionally, Erisir's research examines proteins such as &lt;a href=\"Amyloid%20beta\"&gt;beta-amyloid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tau%20protein\"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; that result in the loss of &lt;a href=\"synaptic%20plasticity\"&gt;synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2008, Erisir received a University of Virginia Mead Grant, which funded an opportunity for Erisir to take undergraduates to the annual Society of Neuroscience conference. In 2010, she mentored a research project that investigated rodent neural circuitry between the brainstem and the oral cavity. This project was selected by the University of Virginia to receive the \"Double Hoo\" Grant."
