    "text": "Centum Cellas, also referred to as \"Centum Cell\u00e6, Centum Celli\", or \"Centum C\u0153li\" (and in ), is a Roman &lt;a href=\"villa%20rustica\"&gt;villa rustica&lt;/a&gt; that dates back to the 1st Century AD, located in the Mount of Santo Ant\u00e3o in &lt;a href=\"Belmonte%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Belmonte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castelo%20Branco%20District\"&gt;Castelo Branco District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the context of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20conquest%20of%20Hispania\"&gt;Roman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the Villa was supposedly the property of a L\u00facio Cec\u00edlio (in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;: LVCIVS C\u00c6CILIVS), a wealthy Roman citizen, a tradesman of &lt;a href=\"tin\"&gt;tin&lt;/a&gt; (an abundant metal in the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;) who ordered its construction in the 1st century AD.\n&lt;a href=\"Hispania\"&gt;Hispania&lt;/a&gt; (modern Spain and Portugal) was one of if not the richest Roman province in the case of mineral ore from around the first century BC. Containing deposits of the metals (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, iron, and mercury), it was very rich in resources. The Romans realised this, and there is evidence of large-scale mining and processing in the region. From its acquisition during the &lt;a href=\"Punic%20Wars\"&gt;Punic Wars&lt;/a&gt; to the Fall of Rome, Iberia continued to produce a significant amount of Roman metals. Tin was especially important being mined only in Iberia, &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britannia&lt;/a&gt;. According to certain archeological sources, it was partially destroyed in the 3rd century AD but rebuilt right after. In the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, over the remnant parts, a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; was built in homage to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Cornelius\"&gt;Pope Cornelius&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are no traces of it today. It is also possible that during this time, due to its proximity with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Kingdom of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, the tower was used as a military outpost. \nIn 1188, the place, then named \"Centuncelli\", received a &lt;a href=\"foral\"&gt;foral&lt;/a&gt; by king &lt;a href=\"Sancho%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Sancho I of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. 19th century Portuguese historian Pinho Leal wrote that the tower was renovated in order to be used as a watchtower in either the 13th or 14th centuries.\nStructure.\nThe tower-like structure is one of the best preserved Roman monuments in the country. The core building has a rectangular floor plan (13.3 m \u00d7 15.5 m) and was two-storey; the second floor is probably a medieval addition. It has multiple entrances with different sizes. Two &lt;a href=\"frieze\"&gt;frieze&lt;/a&gt;s separate the floors. The tower is 12 m high and originally stood in a building complex (the \"&lt;a href=\"villa%20rustica\"&gt;villa rustica&lt;/a&gt;\"). On three sides it was surrounded by extensions, of which only the foundations are visible. The sides were surrounded by rows of three chambers. At the front was the pillared portico of an open courtyard. The construction is of blocks (&lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;), which is quite unusual in Europe and reminiscent of Syria and North Africa. The position of the outer openings was dominated by the view that results from this point, located on a Roman road on the one kilometer distant confluence of the rivers &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%AAzere%20River\"&gt;Z\u00eazere&lt;/a&gt; and Gaia.\nListing.\nCentum Cellas is listed as a National Monument by the Portuguese Government under the decree n\u00ba 14 425, of 15 October 1927, published in the Government's Diary n\u00ba 136.\nMyths.\nMuch mystery surrounds the function this tower served, having fomented many folk tales and theories throughout the centuries. One of the traditions claims that it was used as a prison.\nRegarding its primitive function, it is believed that it could have been a \"pr\u00e6torium\" (a Roman military camp). Meanwhile, several archeological prospection campaigns in the surrounding areas, carried out during the 1960s and 1990s, indicate that it was most likely a &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;, being the tower an integral part of the \"pars urbana\". Excavations are still ongoing."
