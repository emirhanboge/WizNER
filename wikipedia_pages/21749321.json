At least 83 recordings exist of the opera as a whole, made between 1912 and 2011, although not all of them are absolutely complete. Of these, 45 are live audio recordings, 22 are studio audio recordings, and 16 are videos or movies. \"Il trovatore\" was first performed at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Apollo\"&gt;Teatro Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, Rome on 19 January 1853. \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" was first presented on 12 January 1857.\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"
