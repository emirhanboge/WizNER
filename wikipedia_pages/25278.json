    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; a quadrilateral is a four-sided &lt;a href=\"polygon\"&gt;polygon&lt;/a&gt;, having four &lt;a href=\"Edge%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;edges&lt;/a&gt; (sides) and four &lt;a href=\"Vertex%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;corners&lt;/a&gt; (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words \"quadri\", a variant of four, and \"latus\", meaning \"side\". Another name for it is tetragon, derived from greek \"tetra\" meaning \"four\" and \"gon\" meaning \"corner\" or \"angle\", in analogy to e.g., &lt;a href=\"pentagon\"&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. \"Gon\" beeing \"angle\" also is at the root of calling it quadrangle, 4-angle, in analogy to triangle. A quadrilateral with vertices formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 is sometimes denoted as formula_5.\nQuadrilaterals are either &lt;a href=\"simple%20polygon\"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt; (not self-intersecting), or &lt;a href=\"complex%20polygon\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; (self-intersecting, or crossed). Simple quadrilaterals are either &lt;a href=\"convex%20polygon\"&gt;convex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"concave%20polygon\"&gt;concave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Internal%20and%20external%20angle\"&gt;interior angles&lt;/a&gt; of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral \"ABCD\" add up to 360 &lt;a href=\"degrees%20of%20arc\"&gt;degrees of arc&lt;/a&gt;, that is\nThis is a special case of the \"n\"-gon interior angle sum formula: (\"n\" \u2212 2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.\nAll non-self-crossing quadrilaterals &lt;a href=\"tessellation\"&gt;tile the plane&lt;/a&gt;, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.\nSimple quadrilaterals.\nAny quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is a simple quadrilateral.\nConvex quadrilaterals.\nIn a convex quadrilateral all interior angles are less than 180\u00b0, and the two diagonals both lie inside the quadrilateral.\nConcave quadrilaterals.\nIn a concave quadrilateral, one interior angle is bigger than 180\u00b0, and one of the two diagonals lies outside the quadrilateral.\nComplex quadrilaterals.\nA &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20self-intersecting%20polygons\"&gt;self-intersecting&lt;/a&gt; quadrilateral is called variously a cross-quadrilateral, crossed quadrilateral, &lt;a href=\"butterfly\"&gt;butterfly&lt;/a&gt; quadrilateral or &lt;a href=\"bow-tie\"&gt;bow-tie&lt;/a&gt; quadrilateral. In a crossed quadrilateral, the four \"interior\" angles on either side of the crossing (two &lt;a href=\"acute%20angle\"&gt;acute&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"reflex%20angle\"&gt;reflex&lt;/a&gt;, all on the left or all on the right as the figure is traced out) add up to 720\u00b0.\nSpecial line segments.\nThe two &lt;a href=\"diagonal\"&gt;diagonal&lt;/a&gt;s of a convex quadrilateral are the &lt;a href=\"line%20segment\"&gt;line segment&lt;/a&gt;s that connect opposite vertices.\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the \"vertex centroid\" of the quadrilateral (see below).\nThe four maltitudes of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side\u2014through the midpoint of the opposite side.\nArea of a convex quadrilateral.\nThere are various general formulas for the &lt;a href=\"area\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides .\nTrigonometric formulas.\nThe area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as\nwhere the lengths of the diagonals are and and the angle between them is . In the case of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral (e.g. rhombus, square, and kite), this formula reduces to formula_8 since is .\nThe area can be also expressed in terms of bimedians as\nwhere the lengths of the bimedians are and and the angle between them is .\n&lt;a href=\"Bretschneider%27s%20formula\"&gt;Bretschneider's formula&lt;/a&gt; expresses the area in terms of the sides and two opposite angles:\nwhere the sides in sequence are , , , , where is the semiperimeter, and and are two (in fact, any two) opposite angles. This reduces to &lt;a href=\"Brahmagupta%27s%20formula\"&gt;Brahmagupta's formula&lt;/a&gt; for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral\u2014when .\nAnother area formula in terms of the sides and angles, with angle being between sides and , and being between sides and , is\nIn the case of a cyclic quadrilateral, the latter formula becomes formula_12\nIn a parallelogram, where both pairs of opposite sides and angles are equal, this formula reduces to formula_13\nAlternatively, we can write the area in terms of the sides and the intersection angle of the diagonals, as long is not :\nIn the case of a parallelogram, the latter formula becomes formula_15\nAnother area formula including the sides , , , is\nwhere is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals, and is the angle between the &lt;a href=\"Quadrilateral%23Special%20line%20segments\"&gt;bimedian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe last trigonometric area formula including the sides , , , and the angle (between and ) is: \nwhich can also be used for the area of a concave quadrilateral (having the concave part opposite to angle ), by just changing the first sign to .\nNon-trigonometric formulas.\nThe following two formulas express the area in terms of the sides , , and , the &lt;a href=\"Semiperimeter%23Quadrilaterals\"&gt;semiperimeter&lt;/a&gt; , and the diagonals , :\nThe first reduces to Brahmagupta's formula in the cyclic quadrilateral case, since then .\nThe area can also be expressed in terms of the bimedians , and the diagonals , :\nIn fact, any three of the four values , , , and suffice for determination of the area, since in any quadrilateral the four values are related by formula_22 The corresponding expressions are:\nif the lengths of two bimedians and one diagonal are given, and\nif the lengths of two diagonals and one bimedian are given.\nVector formulas.\nThe area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using &lt;a href=\"Vector%20%28geometric%29\"&gt;vectors&lt;/a&gt;. Let vectors and form the diagonals from to and from to . The area of the quadrilateral is then\nwhich is half the magnitude of the &lt;a href=\"cross%20product\"&gt;cross product&lt;/a&gt; of vectors and . In two-dimensional Euclidean space, expressing vector as a &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20vector%23In%20Cartesian%20space\"&gt;free vector in Cartesian space&lt;/a&gt; equal to and as , this can be rewritten as:\nDiagonals.\nProperties of the diagonals in quadrilaterals.\nIn the following table it is listed if the diagonals in some of the most basic quadrilaterals bisect each other, if their diagonals are &lt;a href=\"perpendicular\"&gt;perpendicular&lt;/a&gt;, and if their diagonals have equal length. The list applies to the most general cases, and excludes named subsets.\n\"Note 1: The most general trapezoids and isosceles trapezoids do not have perpendicular diagonals, but there are infinite numbers of (non-similar) trapezoids and isosceles trapezoids that do have perpendicular diagonals and are not any other named quadrilateral.\"\n\"Note 2: In a kite, one diagonal bisects the other. The most general kite has unequal diagonals, but there is an infinite number of (non-similar) kites in which the diagonals are equal in length (and the kites are not any other named quadrilateral).\"\nLengths of the diagonals.\nThe lengths of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" can be calculated using the &lt;a href=\"law%20of%20cosines\"&gt;law of cosines&lt;/a&gt; on each triangle formed by one diagonal and two sides of the quadrilateral. Thus\nand\nOther, more symmetric formulas for the lengths of the diagonals, are\nand\nGeneralizations of the parallelogram law and Ptolemy's theorem.\nIn any convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", the sum of the squares of the four sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the two diagonals plus four times the square of the line segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals. Thus\nwhere \"x\" is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is sometimes known as &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20quadrilateral%20theorem\"&gt;Euler's quadrilateral theorem&lt;/a&gt; and is a generalization of the &lt;a href=\"parallelogram%20law\"&gt;parallelogram law&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe German mathematician &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Anton%20Bretschneider\"&gt;Carl Anton Bretschneider&lt;/a&gt; derived in 1842 the following generalization of &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Ptolemy's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the product of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral\nThis relation can be considered to be a &lt;a href=\"law%20of%20cosines\"&gt;law of cosines&lt;/a&gt; for a quadrilateral. In a &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20quadrilateral\"&gt;cyclic quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt;, where \"A\" + \"C\" = 180\u00b0, it reduces to \"pq = ac + bd\". Since cos (\"A\" + \"C\") \u2265 \u22121, it also gives a proof of Ptolemy's inequality.\nOther metric relations.\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are the feet of the normals from \"B\" and \"D\" to the diagonal \"AC\" = \"p\" in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides \"a\" = \"AB\", \"b\" = \"BC\", \"c\" = \"CD\", \"d\" = \"DA\", then\nIn a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with sides \"a\" = \"AB\", \"b\" = \"BC\", \"c\" = \"CD\", \"d\" = \"DA\", and where the diagonals intersect at \"E\",\nwhere \"e\" = \"AE\", \"f\" = \"BE\", \"g\" = \"CE\", and \"h\" = \"DE\".\nThe shape and size of a convex quadrilateral are fully determined by the lengths of its sides in sequence and of one diagonal between two specified vertices. The two diagonals \"p, q\" and the four side lengths \"a, b, c, d\" of a quadrilateral are related by the &lt;a href=\"Distance%20geometry%23Cayley.E2.80.93Menger%20determinants\"&gt;Cayley-Menger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"determinant\"&gt;determinant&lt;/a&gt;, as follows:\nAngle bisectors.\nThe internal &lt;a href=\"angle%20bisector\"&gt;angle bisector&lt;/a&gt;s of a convex quadrilateral either form a &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20quadrilateral\"&gt;cyclic quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt; (that is, the four intersection points of adjacent angle bisectors are &lt;a href=\"concyclic%20points\"&gt;concyclic&lt;/a&gt;) or they are &lt;a href=\"Concurrent%20lines\"&gt;concurrent&lt;/a&gt;. In the latter case the quadrilateral is a &lt;a href=\"tangential%20quadrilateral\"&gt;tangential quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn quadrilateral \"ABCD\", if the &lt;a href=\"bisection%23Of%20angles\"&gt;angle bisectors&lt;/a&gt; of \"A\" and \"C\" meet on diagonal \"BD\", then the angle bisectors of \"B\" and \"D\" meet on diagonal \"AC\".\nBimedians.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quadrilateral%23Special%20line%20segments\"&gt;bimedian&lt;/a&gt;s of a quadrilateral are the line segments connecting the &lt;a href=\"midpoint\"&gt;midpoint&lt;/a&gt;s of the opposite sides. The intersection of the bimedians is the &lt;a href=\"centroid\"&gt;centroid&lt;/a&gt; of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\nThe midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral (convex, concave or crossed) are the vertices of a &lt;a href=\"parallelogram\"&gt;parallelogram&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Varignon%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Varignon parallelogram&lt;/a&gt;. It has the following properties:\nThe two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are &lt;a href=\"Concurrent%20lines\"&gt;concurrent&lt;/a&gt; and are all bisected by their point of intersection.\nIn a convex quadrilateral with sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and \"d\", the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides \"a\" and \"c\" is\nwhere \"p\" and \"q\" are the length of the diagonals. The length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides \"b\" and \"d\" is\nHence\nThis is also a &lt;a href=\"corollary\"&gt;corollary&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"parallelogram%20law\"&gt;parallelogram law&lt;/a&gt; applied in the Varignon parallelogram.\nThe lengths of the bimedians can also be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the distance \"x\" between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is possible when using Euler's quadrilateral theorem in the above formulas. Whence\nand\nNote that the two opposite sides in these formulas are not the two that the bimedian connects.\nIn a convex quadrilateral, there is the following &lt;a href=\"Duality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;dual&lt;/a&gt; connection between the bimedians and the diagonals:\nTrigonometric identities.\nThe four angles of a simple quadrilateral \"ABCD\" satisfy the following identities:\nand\nAlso,\nIn the last two formulas, no angle is allowed to be a &lt;a href=\"right%20angle\"&gt;right angle&lt;/a&gt;, since tan\u00a090\u00b0 is not defined.\nLet formula_44, formula_45, formula_46, formula_47 be the sides of a general convex quadrilateral, formula_48 is the semiperimeter, \nand formula_1 and formula_3 are opposite angles, then\nand\nWe can use these identities to derive the &lt;a href=\"Bretschneider%27s%20Formula\"&gt;Bretschneider's Formula&lt;/a&gt;.\nInequalities.\nArea.\nIf a convex quadrilateral has the consecutive sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" and the diagonals \"p\", \"q\", then its area \"K\" satisfies\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Bretschneider%27s%20formula\"&gt;Bretschneider's formula&lt;/a&gt; it directly follows that the area of a quadrilateral satisfies\nwith equality &lt;a href=\"if%20and%20only%20if\"&gt;if and only if&lt;/a&gt; the quadrilateral is &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20quadrilateral\"&gt;cyclic&lt;/a&gt; or degenerate such that one side is equal to the sum of the other three (it has collapsed into a &lt;a href=\"line%20segment\"&gt;line segment&lt;/a&gt;, so the area is zero).\nThe area of any quadrilateral also satisfies the inequality\nDenoting the perimeter as \"L\", we have\nwith equality only in the case of a square.\nThe area of a convex quadrilateral also satisfies\nfor diagonal lengths \"p\" and \"q\", with equality if and only if the diagonals are perpendicular.\nLet \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with the area \"K\" and diagonals \"AC = p\", \"BD = q\". Then\nLet \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with the area \"K\", then the following inequality holds:\nDiagonals and bimedians.\nA corollary to Euler's quadrilateral theorem is the inequality\nwhere equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is a &lt;a href=\"parallelogram\"&gt;parallelogram&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Leonhard%20Euler\"&gt;Euler&lt;/a&gt; also generalized &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Ptolemy's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which is an equality in a &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20quadrilateral\"&gt;cyclic quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt;, into an inequality for a convex quadrilateral. It states that\nwhere there is equality &lt;a href=\"if%20and%20only%20if\"&gt;if and only if&lt;/a&gt; the quadrilateral is cyclic. This is often called &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%27s%20inequality\"&gt;Ptolemy's inequality&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn any convex quadrilateral the bimedians \"m, n\" and the diagonals \"p, q\" are related by the inequality\nwith equality holding if and only if the diagonals are equal. This follows directly from the quadrilateral identity formula_66\nSides.\nThe sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\" of any quadrilateral satisfy\nand\nMaximum and minimum properties.\nAmong all quadrilaterals with a given &lt;a href=\"perimeter\"&gt;perimeter&lt;/a&gt;, the one with the largest area is the &lt;a href=\"Square%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;square&lt;/a&gt;. This is called the \"&lt;a href=\"isoperimetric%20inequality\"&gt;isoperimetric theorem&lt;/a&gt; for quadrilaterals\". It is a direct consequence of the area inequality\nwhere \"K\" is the area of a convex quadrilateral with perimeter \"L\". Equality holds &lt;a href=\"if%20and%20only%20if\"&gt;if and only if&lt;/a&gt; the quadrilateral is a square. The dual theorem states that of all quadrilaterals with a given area, the square has the shortest perimeter.\nThe quadrilateral with given side lengths that has the &lt;a href=\"Maxima%20and%20minima\"&gt;maximum&lt;/a&gt; area is the &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20quadrilateral\"&gt;cyclic quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf all convex quadrilaterals with given diagonals, the &lt;a href=\"orthodiagonal%20quadrilateral\"&gt;orthodiagonal quadrilateral&lt;/a&gt; has the largest area. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the area of a convex quadrilateral satisfies\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the angle between the diagonals \"p\" and \"q\". Equality holds if and only if \"\u03b8\" = 90\u00b0.\nIf \"P\" is an interior point in a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", then\nFrom this inequality it follows that the point inside a quadrilateral that &lt;a href=\"Maxima%20and%20minima\"&gt;minimizes&lt;/a&gt; the sum of distances to the &lt;a href=\"Vertex%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;vertices&lt;/a&gt; is the intersection of the diagonals. Hence that point is the &lt;a href=\"Fermat%20point\"&gt;Fermat point&lt;/a&gt; of a convex quadrilateral.\nRemarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral.\nThe centre of a quadrilateral can be defined in several different ways. The \"vertex centroid\" comes from considering the quadrilateral as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The \"side centroid\" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just &lt;a href=\"centroid\"&gt;centroid&lt;/a&gt; (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the quadrilateral as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.\nThe \"vertex centroid\" is the intersection of the two &lt;a href=\"Quadrilateral%23Special%20line%20segments\"&gt;bimedians&lt;/a&gt;. As with any polygon, the \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates of the vertex centroid are the &lt;a href=\"arithmetic%20mean\"&gt;arithmetic mean&lt;/a&gt;s of the \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates of the vertices.\nThe \"area centroid\" of quadrilateral \"ABCD\" can be constructed in the following way. Let \"Ga\", \"Gb\", \"Gc\", \"Gd\" be the centroids of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively. Then the \"area centroid\" is the intersection of the lines \"GaGc\" and \"GbGd\".\nIn a general convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\", there are no natural analogies to the &lt;a href=\"circumcenter\"&gt;circumcenter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orthocenter\"&gt;orthocenter&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;triangle&lt;/a&gt;. But two such points can be constructed in the following way. Let \"Oa\", \"Ob\", \"Oc\", \"Od\" be the circumcenters of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively; and denote by \"Ha\", \"Hb\", \"Hc\", \"Hd\" the orthocenters in the same triangles. Then the intersection of the lines \"OaOc\" and \"ObOd\" is called the &lt;a href=\"circumcenter%20of%20mass\"&gt;quasicircumcenter&lt;/a&gt;, and the intersection of the lines \"HaHc\" and \"HbHd\" is called the \"quasiorthocenter\" of the convex quadrilateral. These points can be used to define an &lt;a href=\"Euler%20line\"&gt;Euler line&lt;/a&gt; of a quadrilateral. In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter \"H\", the \"area centroid\" \"G\", and the quasicircumcenter \"O\" are &lt;a href=\"collinear\"&gt;collinear&lt;/a&gt; in this order, and \"HG\" = 2\"GO\".\nThere can also be defined a \"quasinine-point center\" \"E\" as the intersection of the lines \"EaEc\" and \"EbEd\", where \"Ea\", \"Eb\", \"Ec\", \"Ed\" are the &lt;a href=\"Nine-point%20circle\"&gt;nine-point centers&lt;/a&gt; of triangles \"BCD\", \"ACD\", \"ABD\", \"ABC\" respectively. Then \"E\" is the &lt;a href=\"midpoint\"&gt;midpoint&lt;/a&gt; of \"OH\".\nAnother remarkable line in a convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the &lt;a href=\"Newton%20line\"&gt;Newton line&lt;/a&gt;, which connects the midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by the vertex centroid. One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the &lt;a href=\"Newton%20line\"&gt;Newton's&lt;/a&gt; one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with the vertex centroid. The line is remarkable by the fact that it contains the (area) centroid. The vertex centroid divides the segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and the (area) centroid in the ratio 3:1.\nFor any quadrilateral \"ABCD\" with points \"P\" and \"Q\" the intersections of \"AD\" and \"BC\" and \"AB\" and \"CD\", respectively, the circles \"(PAB), (PCD), (QAD),\" and \"(QBC)\" pass through a common point \"M\", called a Miquel point.\nFor a convex quadrilateral \"ABCD\" in which \"E\" is the point of intersection of the diagonals and \"F\" is the point of intersection of the extensions of sides \"BC\" and \"AD\", let \u03c9 be a circle through \"E\" and \"F\" which meets \"CB\" internally at \"M\" and \"DA\" internally at \"N\". Let \"CA\" meet \u03c9 again at \"L\" and let \"DB\" meet \u03c9 again at \"K\". Then there holds: the straight lines \"NK\" and \"ML\" intersect at point \"P\" that is located on the side \"AB\"; the straight lines \"NL\" and \"KM\" intersect at point \"Q\" that is located on the side \"CD\". \nPoints \"P\" and \"Q\" are called \u201dPascal points\u201d formed by circle \u03c9 on sides \"AB\" and \"CD\".\nTaxonomy.\nA hierarchical &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28general%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; of quadrilaterals is illustrated by the figure to the right. Lower classes are special cases of higher classes they are connected to. Note that \"trapezoid\" here is referring to the North American definition (the British equivalent is a trapezium). Inclusive definitions are used throughout.\nSkew quadrilaterals.\nA non-planar quadrilateral is called a skew quadrilateral. Formulas to compute its dihedral angles from the edge lengths and the angle between two adjacent edges were derived for work on the properties of molecules such as &lt;a href=\"cyclobutane\"&gt;cyclobutane&lt;/a&gt; that contain a \"puckered\" ring of four atoms. Historically the term gauche quadrilateral was also used to mean a skew quadrilateral. A skew quadrilateral together with its diagonals form a (possibly non-regular) &lt;a href=\"tetrahedron\"&gt;tetrahedron&lt;/a&gt;, and conversely every skew quadrilateral comes from a tetrahedron where a pair of opposite &lt;a href=\"edge%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;edge&lt;/a&gt;s is removed."
