She is the first player from &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to become a member of the LPGA Tour, which she joined in &lt;a href=\"2008%20LPGA%20Tour\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. Feng has 10 victories on the tour, including the &lt;a href=\"2012%20LPGA%20Championship\"&gt;2012 LPGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; title, in which she shot a bogey-free 67 in the final round to win by two strokes. She is the first player from China to win an LPGA major championship, as well as the first player from mainland China (male or female) to win a major championship. Her best finish in 16 previous majors was a tie for 22nd at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Kraft%20Nabisco%20Championship\"&gt;2012 Kraft Nabisco Championship&lt;/a&gt;. With the victory, she moved from tenth to fifth in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20World%20Golf%20Rankings\"&gt;Women's World Golf Rankings&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 August 2016, Feng won the Olympic bronze medal in women's golf at the &lt;a href=\"Golf%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20individual\"&gt;2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. From November 2017 to April 2018, she was first in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20World%20Golf%20Rankings\"&gt;Women's World Golf Rankings&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life, family and early golf development.\nFeng was born in Guangzhou, in the province of Guangdong, and started playing golf at age 10 at the urging of her father, Feng Xiong, who worked at the golf association in their hometown.\nDue to limited resources and a lack of reputable golf coaches, Feng's father, who was the captain of a junior golf team, worked with her every day. During the week, Feng would attend school from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and then her father would bring her to the driving range where she would practice for two hours hitting golf balls off a mat. On the weekends, she travelled outside of the city to a local course to play practice rounds and work on her short game.\nWhen Feng was in high school an agent discovered her, at a tournament in China, and this led to her meeting coach Gary Gilchrist. When Feng was 17 years old, Gilchrist offered her a full scholarship to attend his junior golf academy in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Feng accepted the offer and moved to the U.S hoping to become a professional golfer. Despite the scholarship to Gilchrist's academy, living expenses, tuition at a nearby high school, and traveling costs became heavy financial burdens on her parents, Feng Xiong and Zheng Yuyan, who both work at governmental institutes and earn average salaries. Feng's parents had spent almost all of their savings by the end of 2007, and they considered mortgaging their house to support their daughter. However, the family support paid off in December 2007 when Feng, a teenager amateur, earned a spot on the LPGA Tour's 2008 season after tying for ninth place at the Tour's qualifying tournament.\nAmateur career.\nFeng won the China Junior Championship and the China Junior Open in 2004. She was a three-time winner of the China Amateur Tournament (2004\u201306). She was the Champion of the 2006 China Women's Amateur Open. A member of the 2006 All-China Championship Team, she earned a medalist honors at the event. In 2007 she was named Golfweeks's Top Chinese Amateur after winning four tournaments on the International Junior Golf Tour (IIGT) in 2007.\nWhile still an amateur, Feng tied for ninth at the LPGA Final &lt;a href=\"Qualifying%20school\"&gt;Qualifying&lt;/a&gt; Tournament in December 2007 to earn a spot on the LPGA Tour in &lt;a href=\"2008%20LPGA%20Tour\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional wins (23).\nLPGA Tour wins (10).\n^ Co-sanctioned with the &lt;a href=\"LPGA%20of%20Japan%20Tour\"&gt;LPGA of Japan Tour&lt;/a&gt;\nLPGA Tour playoff record (0\u20133)\nLPGA of Japan Tour wins (7).\n^ Co-sanctioned with the &lt;a href=\"LPGA%20Tour\"&gt;LPGA Tour&lt;/a&gt;\nLadies European Tour wins (7).\nLadies European Tour playoff record (1\u20130)\nMajor championships.\nResults timeline.\n\"Results not in chronological order before 2019.\"\n^ The Evian Championship was added as a major in 2013\nCUT = missed the half-way cut&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" = tied\nWorld ranking.\nPosition in &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20World%20Golf%20Rankings\"&gt;Women's World Golf Rankings&lt;/a&gt; at the end of each calendar year.\nTeam appearances.\nAmateur\nProfessional"
