    "text": "The Civil Aviation Department (CAD) is the &lt;a href=\"civil%20aviation%20authority\"&gt;civil aviation authority&lt;/a&gt; of Hong Kong, headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hong Kong International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The department is responsible for providing air traffic control services to all aircraft operating within the Hong Kong &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Information%20Region\"&gt;Flight Information Region&lt;/a&gt;. It reports to the &lt;a href=\"Transport%20and%20Housing%20Bureau\"&gt;Transport and Housing Bureau&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Government\"&gt;Hong Kong Government&lt;/a&gt;. The current Director-General of Civil Aviation is Victor Liu Chi-yung.\nThe CAD was also responsible for managing the former Hong Kong International Airport at &lt;a href=\"Kai%20Tak%20Airport\"&gt;Kai Tak&lt;/a&gt;, until it was retired and replaced by the new &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hong Kong International Airport&lt;/a&gt; managed by the &lt;a href=\"Airport%20Authority%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Airport Authority&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth the Flight Standards &amp; Airworthiness Division and Accident Investigation Division of the CAD investigates &lt;a href=\"aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents\"&gt;aviation accidents and incidents&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; rule, CAD was not a sub-unit of the British &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1997, CAD maintains independence from the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Aviation%20Administration%20of%20China\"&gt;Civil Aviation Administration of China&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe CAD was established on 1 May 1946.\nIn 2018, responsibility for investigation of aircraft accidents was transferred to the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Air%20Accident%20Investigation%20Authority\"&gt;Air Accident Investigation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (AAIA).\nFacilities.\nThe agency is headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hong Kong International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Chek%20Lap%20Kok\"&gt;Chek Lap Kok&lt;/a&gt;. Previously it was on the 46th floor of the &lt;a href=\"Queensway%20Government%20Offices\"&gt;Queensway Government Offices&lt;/a&gt;.\nSafety concerns.\nIn late 2016, CAD introduced a new air traffic system that attracted concerns over the increased risk that it puts travellers departing and arriving into Hong Kong airspace. On 8 February, it was revealed by a &lt;a href=\"FactWire\"&gt;FactWire&lt;/a&gt; investigation that there were six cases of safety incidents involving \u201closs of separation\u201d in January 2017 because CAD's new air traffic management system (ATMS) did not operate correctly. Five of the cases occurred during the peak-time Lunar New Year holidays, and none was made known to the public. As a comparison, it was noted that only 10 incidents of \"loss of separation\" would happen per year under the previous system and such cases were treated as very serious due to the risk of mid-air collision. After criticism of having covered up the 6 \"los\" incidents, CAD released a statement on their website at 11:34pm to claim that all incidents are \"minor\", although industry experts claim that all \"los\" incidents should be treated as serious due to the potential damage.\nFurther criticism and investigation has begun into CAD's director Simon Li into whether kickbacks and additional benefits was received during the tender of the new air traffic system."
