    "text": "The role of yeast in winemaking is the most important element that distinguishes &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"grape\"&gt;grape&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"juice\"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Aanaerobic\"&gt;absence of oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yeast\"&gt;yeast&lt;/a&gt; converts the &lt;a href=\"sugar%20in%20wine\"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; of wine grapes into &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; through the process of &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20%28wine%29\"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt;. The more &lt;a href=\"ripeness%20in%20wine\"&gt;sugars in the grapes&lt;/a&gt;, the higher the potential alcohol level of the wine if the yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation to &lt;a href=\"dryness%20%28wine%29\"&gt;dryness&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes winemakers will stop fermentation early in order to leave some &lt;a href=\"residual%20sugars\"&gt;residual sugars&lt;/a&gt; and sweetness in the wine such as with &lt;a href=\"dessert%20wine\"&gt;dessert wine&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be achieved by dropping fermentation temperatures to the point where the yeast are inactive, sterile &lt;a href=\"filtering%20%28wine%29\"&gt;filtering&lt;/a&gt; the wine to remove the yeast or &lt;a href=\"fortification%20%28wine%29\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"brandy\"&gt;brandy&lt;/a&gt; or neutral spirits to kill off the yeast cells. If fermentation is unintentionally stopped, such as when the yeasts become exhausted of available nutrients and the wine has not yet reached dryness, this is considered a &lt;a href=\"stuck%20fermentation\"&gt;stuck fermentation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most common yeast associated with &lt;a href=\"winemaking\"&gt;winemaking&lt;/a&gt; is \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae\"&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/a&gt;\" which has been favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; as well as its ability to thrive in normal wine &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; between 2.8 and 4. Despite its widespread use which often includes deliberate &lt;a href=\"inoculation\"&gt;inoculation&lt;/a&gt; from cultured stock, \"S. cerevisiae\" is rarely the only yeast species involved in a fermentation. Grapes brought in from &lt;a href=\"harvest%20%28wine%29\"&gt;harvest&lt;/a&gt; are usually teeming with a variety of \"wild yeast\" from the \"&lt;a href=\"Kloeckera\"&gt;Kloeckera&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Candida%20%28fungus%29\"&gt;Candida&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"genera\"&gt;genera&lt;/a&gt;. These yeasts often begin the fermentation process almost as soon as the grapes are picked when the weight of the clusters in the harvest bins begin to crush the grapes, releasing the sugar-rich must. While additions of sulfur dioxide (often added at the crusher) may limit some of the wild yeast activities, these yeasts will usually die out once the alcohol level reaches about 15% due to the &lt;a href=\"toxicity\"&gt;toxicity&lt;/a&gt; of alcohol on the yeast cells &lt;a href=\"physiology\"&gt;physiology&lt;/a&gt; while the more alcohol tolerant \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces\"&gt;Saccharomyces&lt;/a&gt;\" species take over. In addition to \"S. cerevisiae\", \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces%20bayanus\"&gt;Saccharomyces bayanus&lt;/a&gt;\" is a species of yeast that can tolerate alcohol levels of 17\u201320% and is often used in fortified wine production such as &lt;a href=\"port%20%28wine%29\"&gt;ports&lt;/a&gt; and varieties such as &lt;a href=\"Zinfandel\"&gt;Zinfandel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syrah\"&gt;Syrah&lt;/a&gt; harvested at high &lt;a href=\"Brix\"&gt;Brix&lt;/a&gt; sugar levels. Another common yeast involved in wine production is \"&lt;a href=\"Brettanomyces\"&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;\" whose presence in a wine may be viewed by different winemakers as either a &lt;a href=\"wine%20fault\"&gt;wine fault&lt;/a&gt; or in limited quantities as an added note of complexity.\nHistory.\nFor most of the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20wine\"&gt;history of wine&lt;/a&gt;, winemakers did not know the mechanism that somehow converted sugary grape juice into alcoholic wine. They could observe the fermentation process which was often described as \"boiling\", \"seething\" or the wine being \"troubled\" due to release of carbon dioxide that gave the wine a frothy, bubbling appearance. This history is preserved in the &lt;a href=\"etymology\"&gt;etymology&lt;/a&gt; of the word \"yeast\" itself which essentially means \"to boil\".\nIn the mid-19th century, the French scientist &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Pasteur\"&gt;Louis Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; was tasked by the French government to study what made some wines spoil. His work, which would later lead to Pasteur being considered one of the \"Fathers of &lt;a href=\"Microbiology\"&gt;Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;\", would uncover the connection between microscopic yeast cells and the process of the fermentation. It was Pasteur who discovered that yeast converted sugars in the must into alcohol and carbon dioxide, though the exact mechanisms of how the yeast would accomplish this task was not discovered till the 20th century with the &lt;a href=\"Embden%E2%80%93Meyerhof%E2%80%93Parnas%20pathway\"&gt;Embden\u2013Meyerhof\u2013Parnas pathway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe yeast species commonly known as \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" was first identified in late 19th century enology text as \"Saccharomyces ellipsoideus\" due to the &lt;a href=\"Ellipse\"&gt;elliptical&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to circular) shape of the cells. Throughout the 20th century, more than 700 different &lt;a href=\"Strain%20%28biology%29\"&gt;strains&lt;/a&gt; of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" were identified. The difference between the vast majority of these strains are mostly minor, though individual winemakers will develop a preference for particular strains when making certain wines or working with particular &lt;a href=\"grape%20varieties\"&gt;grape varieties&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these difference include the \"vigor\" or speed of fermentation, temperature tolerance, the production of volatile &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; compounds (such as &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt;) and other compounds that may influence the &lt;a href=\"aroma%20%28wine%29\"&gt;aroma&lt;/a&gt; of the wine.\nRole in winemaking.\nThe primary role of yeast is to convert the sugars present (namely &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt;) in the grape must into alcohol. The yeast accomplishes this by utilizing glucose through a series of metabolic pathways that, in the presence of oxygen, produces not only large amounts of energy for the cell but also many different intermediates that the cell needs to function. In the absence of oxygen (&lt;a href=\"Crabtree%20effect\"&gt;and sometimes even in the presence of oxygen&lt;/a&gt;), the cell will continue some metabolic functions (such as &lt;a href=\"glycolysis\"&gt;glycolysis&lt;/a&gt;) but will rely on other pathways such as reduction of &lt;a href=\"acetaldehyde\"&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; into ethanol (fermentation) to \"recharge\" the &lt;a href=\"co-enzymes\"&gt;co-enzymes&lt;/a&gt; needed to keep metabolism going. It is through this process of fermentation that ethanol is released by the yeast cells as a waste product. Eventually, if the yeast cells are healthy and fermentation is allowed to run to the completion, all fermentable sugars will be used up by the yeast with only the unfermentable &lt;a href=\"pentose\"&gt;pentose&lt;/a&gt; leaving behind a negligible amount of residual sugar.\nOther compounds in wine produced by yeast.\nWhile the production of alcohol is the most noteworthy by-product of yeast metabolism from a winemaking perspective, there are a number of other products that yeast produce that can be also influence the resulting wine. This includes &lt;a href=\"glycerol\"&gt;glycerol&lt;/a&gt; which is produced when an intermediate of the glycolysis cycle (&lt;a href=\"dihydroxyacetone\"&gt;dihydroxyacetone&lt;/a&gt;) is reduced to \"recharge\" the &lt;a href=\"Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide\"&gt;NADH enzyme&lt;/a&gt; needed to continue other metabolic activities. This is usually produced early in the fermentation process before the mechanisms to reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol to recharge NADH becomes the cell's primary means of maintaining &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;redox&lt;/a&gt; balance. As glycerol contributes increased &lt;a href=\"body%20%28wine%29\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; and a slightly sweet taste without increasing the alcohol level of the wine, some winemakers try to intentionally favor conditions that would promote glycerol production in wine. This includes selecting yeast strains that favor glycerol production (or allowing some wild yeast like \"Kloeckera\" and \"Metschnikowia\" to ferment), increased oxygen exposure and aeration as well as fermenting at higher temperatures. Glycerol production is also encouraged if most available acetaldehyde is made unavailable by binding with &lt;a href=\"bisulfite\"&gt;bisulfite&lt;/a&gt; molecules in the wine, but it would take a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide addition (far beyond &lt;a href=\"wine%20laws\"&gt;legal limits&lt;/a&gt;) to prolong glycerol production beyond just these very nascent stages of fermentation.\nOther by-products of yeast include:\nLees.\nWhen yeast cells die, they sink to the bottom of the fermentation vessel where they combine with insoluble &lt;a href=\"tartrates\"&gt;tartrates&lt;/a&gt;, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the &lt;a href=\"lees%20%28wine%29\"&gt;lees&lt;/a&gt;. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the \"gross lees\" as opposed to the less coarse \"fine lees\" that come as the wine continues to &lt;a href=\"settle%20%28wine%29\"&gt;settle&lt;/a&gt; and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the &lt;a href=\"autolysis%20%28wine%29\"&gt;autolysis&lt;/a&gt; (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;reductive&lt;/a&gt; conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call \"b\u00e2tonnage\"). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called \"sur lie\") will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.\nThe process of leaving the wine to spend some contact with the lees has a long history in winemaking, being known to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Romans%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Ancient Romans&lt;/a&gt; and described by &lt;a href=\"Cato%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Cato the Elder&lt;/a&gt; in the 2nd century BC. Today the practice is widely associated with any red wines that are &lt;a href=\"oak%20%28wine%29\"&gt;barrel fermented&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muscadet\"&gt;Muscadet&lt;/a&gt;, sparkling wine &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Chardonnay\"&gt;Chardonnay&lt;/a&gt; produced in many wine regions across the globe. Typically when wines are left in contact with their lees, they are regularly stirred in order to release the &lt;a href=\"mannoproteins\"&gt;mannoproteins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polysaccharides\"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt; and other compounds that were present in the yeast cell walls and membranes. This stirring also helps avoid the development of reductive sulfur compounds like &lt;a href=\"mercaptans\"&gt;mercaptans&lt;/a&gt; and hydrogen sulfide that can appear if the lees layer is more than 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0inches) thick and undisturbed for more than a week.\nMost of the benefits associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of &lt;a href=\"mannose\"&gt;mannose&lt;/a&gt; and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with &lt;a href=\"hydrophobic\"&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/a&gt; aroma compounds that become &lt;a href=\"volatilized\"&gt;volatilized&lt;/a&gt; as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to &lt;a href=\"cold%20stabilization\"&gt;tartrate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heat%20stabilization\"&gt;protein stability&lt;/a&gt;, help enhance the &lt;a href=\"body%20%28wine%29\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mouthfeel%20%28wine%29\"&gt;mouthfeel&lt;/a&gt; of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and &lt;a href=\"astringency%20%28wine%29\"&gt;astringency&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"tannin%20%28wine%29\"&gt;tannins&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecondary fermentation.\nThe production of &lt;a href=\"Champagne\"&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"sparkling%20wine\"&gt;sparkling wine&lt;/a&gt;s requires a second fermentation to occur in the bottle in order to produce the &lt;a href=\"carbonation\"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt; necessary for the style. A small amount of sugared liquid is added to individual bottles, and the yeast is allowed to convert this to more alcohol and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;. The lees are then ricked into the neck of the bottle, frozen, and expelled via pressure of the carbonated wine.\nTypes of yeasts used in winemaking.\nYeast &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; includes classification of yeast species depending on &lt;a href=\"Mating%20of%20yeast\"&gt;the presence or absence of a sexual phase&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, some winemaking yeasts are classified by their asexual &lt;a href=\"anamorph\"&gt;anamorph&lt;/a&gt; (or \"imperfect\" form) while others may be classified by their sexual &lt;a href=\"teleomorph\"&gt;teleomorph&lt;/a&gt; (or \"perfect\" form). A common example of this is \"&lt;a href=\"Brettanomyces\"&gt;Brettanomyces&lt;/a&gt;\" (or \"Brett\") that is usually referenced in wine and &lt;a href=\"viticulture\"&gt;viticulture&lt;/a&gt; text under its asexual classification though some scientific and winemaking texts may describe specific species (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Dekkera%20bruxellensis\"&gt;Dekkera bruxellensis&lt;/a&gt;\") under its &lt;a href=\"sporulating\"&gt;sporulating&lt;/a&gt; sexual classification of \"&lt;a href=\"Dekkera\"&gt;Dekkera&lt;/a&gt;\". Unless otherwise noted, this article will commonly refer to the asexual form of wine yeast.\nThe most common yeast generally associated with winemaking is \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" which is also used in &lt;a href=\"bread%20making\"&gt;bread making&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;. Other genera of yeast that can be involved in winemaking (either beneficially or as the cause of potential &lt;a href=\"wine%20faults\"&gt;wine faults&lt;/a&gt;) include:\nSaccharomyces.\nThe yeast genus \"Saccharomyces\" (sugar mold) is favored for winemaking (for both grapes as well as other &lt;a href=\"fruit%20wines\"&gt;fruit wines&lt;/a&gt; in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily &lt;a href=\"Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;ferment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sucrose\"&gt;sucrose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"raffinose\"&gt;raffinose&lt;/a&gt; and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, &lt;a href=\"maltose\"&gt;maltose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt;. However, \"Saccharomyces\" cannot ferment or utilize &lt;a href=\"pentose\"&gt;pentose&lt;/a&gt;s (such as &lt;a href=\"arabinose\"&gt;arabinose&lt;/a&gt;) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.\nIn addition to \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", other species within the genus \"Saccharomyces\" that are involved with winemaking include:\nInfluences of different strains on fermentation.\nIn 1996, \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" was the first single-celled, &lt;a href=\"Eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryotic&lt;/a&gt; organism to have its entire &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sequenced\"&gt;sequenced&lt;/a&gt;. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by &lt;a href=\"mycologist\"&gt;mycologist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"enologist\"&gt;enologist&lt;/a&gt;s in identifying different &lt;a href=\"strains%20%28biology%29\"&gt;strains&lt;/a&gt; of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" that are used in &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"winemaking\"&gt;winemaking&lt;/a&gt;. Today there are several hundred different strains of \"S. cerevisiae\" identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the &lt;a href=\"wines%20age\"&gt;wines age&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome distinct difference among various strains include the production of certain \"off-flavor\" and aromas that may be temporary (but producing a \"stinky fermentation\") or could stay with the wine and either have to be dealt with through other winemaking means (such as the presence of volatile sulfur compounds like &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt;) or leave a faulty wine. Another difference includes the \"vigor\" or speed of fermentation (which can also be influenced by other factors beyond yeast selection) with some yeast strains having the tendency to do \"fast ferments\" while others may take longer to get going.\nAnother less measurable difference that are subject to more debate and questions of winemakers preference is the influence of strain selection on the &lt;a href=\"varietal\"&gt;varietal&lt;/a&gt; flavors of certainly grape varieties such as &lt;a href=\"Sauvignon%20blanc\"&gt;Sauvignon blanc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9millon\"&gt;S\u00e9millon&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that these wines can be influenced by &lt;a href=\"thiols\"&gt;thiols&lt;/a&gt; produced by the &lt;a href=\"hydrolysis\"&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/a&gt; of certain &lt;a href=\"cysteine\"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;-linked compounds by &lt;a href=\"enzymes\"&gt;enzymes&lt;/a&gt; that are more prevalent in particular strains. Other aromatic varieties such as &lt;a href=\"Gew%C3%BCrztraminer\"&gt;Gew\u00fcrztraminer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riesling\"&gt;Riesling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muscat%20%28grape%29\"&gt;Muscat&lt;/a&gt; may also be influenced by yeast strains containing high levels of &lt;a href=\"glycosidases\"&gt;glycosidases&lt;/a&gt; enzymes that can modify &lt;a href=\"monoterpenes\"&gt;monoterpenes&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, though potentially to a much smaller extent, other varieties could be influenced by hydrolytic enzymes working on &lt;a href=\"aliphatics\"&gt;aliphatics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"norisoprenoids\"&gt;norisoprenoids&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"benzene\"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt; derivatives such as &lt;a href=\"polyphenols%20%28wine%29\"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"must\"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"sparkling%20wine%20production\"&gt;sparkling wine production&lt;/a&gt; some winemakers select strains (such as one known as \"\u00c9pernay\" named after the town in the &lt;a href=\"Champagne%20wine%20region\"&gt;Champagne wine region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"France%20%28wine%29\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and \"California Champagne\", also known as &lt;a href=\"UC-Davis\"&gt;UC-Davis&lt;/a&gt; strain 505) that are known to &lt;a href=\"flocculate\"&gt;flocculate&lt;/a&gt; well, allowing the dead yeast cells to be removed easily by &lt;a href=\"riddling\"&gt;riddling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"disgorging\"&gt;disgorgement&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Sherry\"&gt;Sherry&lt;/a&gt; production, the surface film of yeast known as &lt;a href=\"flor\"&gt;flor&lt;/a&gt; used to make the distinctive style of &lt;a href=\"fino\"&gt;fino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"manzanilla%20%28wine%29\"&gt;manzanilla&lt;/a&gt; sherries comes from different strains of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", though the commercial flor yeast available for inoculation is often from different species of \"Saccharomyces\", \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces%20beticus\"&gt;Saccharomyces beticus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces%20fermentati\"&gt;Saccharomyces fermentati&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Saccharomyces%20bayanus\"&gt;Saccharomyces bayanus&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWild yeasts and natural fermentation.\nIn winemaking, the term \"wild yeast\" has multiple meanings. In its most basic context, it refers to yeast that has not been introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these \"wild yeasts\" often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; of a winery. Very often these are strains of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these wild yeasts are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or natural yeast as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these \"in-house\" strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or \"natural fermentations\". The (c. 304) \"&lt;a href=\"Nanfang%20Caomu%20Zhuang\"&gt;Nanfang Caomu Zhuang&lt;/a&gt;\" has the earliest description of winemaking using \"&lt;a href=\"Nanfang%20Caomu%20Zhuang%23Herb%20ferment\"&gt;herb ferment&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"c\u01ceoq\u016b\" \u8349\u9eb4) wild yeast with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous \"&lt;a href=\"Gelsemium\"&gt;Gelsemium elegans&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"y\u011bg\u00e9\" \u51b6\u845b).\nAnother use of the term \"wild yeast\" refers to the non-\"Saccharomyces\" genera of yeasts that are present in the vineyard, on the surface of &lt;a href=\"grapevines\"&gt;grapevines&lt;/a&gt; and of the grapes themselves. Anywhere from 160 to 100,000 &lt;a href=\"colony%20forming%20units\"&gt;colony forming units&lt;/a&gt; of wild yeasts per berry could exist in a typical vineyard. These yeasts can be carried by air currents, birds and insects through the vineyard and even into the winery (such as by &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3AFruit%20fly\"&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;). The most common wild yeasts found in the vineyard are from the genera \"&lt;a href=\"Kloeckera\"&gt;Kloeckera&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Candida%20%28fungus%29\"&gt;Candida&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pichia\"&gt;Pichia&lt;/a&gt;\" with the species \"&lt;a href=\"Kloeckera%20apiculata\"&gt;Kloeckera apiculata&lt;/a&gt;\" being the most dominant species by far. \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", itself, is actually quite rarely found in the vineyard or on the surface freshly harvested wine grapes unless the winery frequently reintroduced winery waste (such as &lt;a href=\"lees%20%28wine%29\"&gt;lees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pomace\"&gt;pomace&lt;/a&gt;) into the vineyard.\nUnlike the \"ambient\" \"Saccharomyces\" wild yeast, these genera of wild yeasts have very low tolerance to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide. They are capable of starting a fermentation and often begin this process as early as the harvest bin when clusters of grapes get slightly crushed under their own weight. Some winemakers will try to \"knock out\" these yeasts with doses of sulfur dioxide, most often at the crusher before the grapes are &lt;a href=\"pressed%20%28wine%29\"&gt;pressed&lt;/a&gt; or allowed to &lt;a href=\"macerate%20%28wine%29\"&gt;macerate&lt;/a&gt; with skin contact. Other winemakers may allow the wild yeasts to continue fermenting until they succumb to the toxicity of the alcohol they produce which is often between 3\u20135% alcohol by volume and then letting either inoculated or \"ambient\" \"Saccharomyces\" strains finish the fermentation.\nThe use of both \"ambient\" and non-\"Saccharomyces\" wild yeasts carries both potential benefits and risk. Some winemakers feel that the use of resident/indigenous yeast helps contribute to the unique expression of \"&lt;a href=\"terroir\"&gt;terroir&lt;/a&gt;\" in the wine. In wine regions such as &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Classified%20Bordeaux\"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; and highly regarded estates will often tout the quality of their resident \"chateau\" strains. To this extent, wineries will often take the leftover &lt;a href=\"pomace\"&gt;pomace&lt;/a&gt; and lees from winemaking and return them to the vineyard to be used as &lt;a href=\"compost\"&gt;compost&lt;/a&gt; in order to encourage the sustained presence of favorable strains. But compared to inoculated yeast, these ambient yeasts hold the risk of having a more unpredictable fermentation. Not only could this unpredictability include the presence of off-flavors/aromas and higher &lt;a href=\"volatile%20acidity\"&gt;volatile acidity&lt;/a&gt; but also the potential for a stuck fermentation if the indigenous yeast strains are not vigorous enough to fully convert all the sugars.\nIt is virtually inevitable that non-\"Saccharomyces\" wild yeast will have a role in beginning the fermentation of virtually every wine but for the wineries that choose to allow these yeasts to continue fermenting versus minimizing their influence do so with the intent of enhancing complexity through bio-diversity. While these non-\"Saccharomyces\" ferment glucose and fructose into alcohol, they also have the potential to create other intermediates that could influence the aroma and flavor profile of the wine. Some of these intermediates could be positive, such as &lt;a href=\"phenethyl%20alcohol\"&gt;phenylethanol&lt;/a&gt;, which can impart a &lt;a href=\"rose\"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;-like aroma. However, as with ambient yeasts, the products of these yeasts can be very unpredictable\u00a0\u2013 especially in terms of the types of flavors and aromas that these yeasts can produce.\nInoculated yeast.\nWhen winemakers select a cultured yeast strain, it is largely done because the winemaker wants a predictable fermentation taken to completion by a strain that has a track record of dependability. Among the particular considerations that are often important to winemakers is a yeast's tendency to:\nInoculated (or \"pure cultured\") yeasts are strains of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" that have been identified and plated from wineries across the world (including notable producers from well-known wine regions such as &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burgundy%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Napa%20Valley%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Napa Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barossa%20Valley%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Barossa Valley&lt;/a&gt;). These strains are tested in laboratories to determine a strain's vigor, sulfur dioxide and alcohol tolerance, production levels of acetic acid and sulfur compounds, ability to re-ferment (positive for sparkling wine but a negative attribute for sweet &lt;a href=\"late-harvest%20wines\"&gt;late-harvest wines&lt;/a&gt;), development of surface film on the wine (positive for &lt;a href=\"flor\"&gt;some Sherry styles&lt;/a&gt; but a negative attribute for many other wines), enhancement of a wine's color or certain varietal characteristics by enzymes in the yeast cells and other metabolic products produced by the yeast, foaming and flocculation tendencies, yeasticidal properties (a trait known as \"&lt;a href=\"Killer%20yeast\"&gt;Killer yeast&lt;/a&gt;\") and tolerance for nutritional deficiencies in a must that may lead to a stuck fermentation.\nRe-hydrating freeze dried yeast cultures.\nPure culture yeasts that are grown in a lab are often &lt;a href=\"freeze%20dried\"&gt;freeze dried&lt;/a&gt; and packaged for commercial use. Prior to their addition into must, these yeasts need to be re-hydrated in \"starter cultures\" that must be carefully monitored (particularly in regards to temperature) to ensure that the yeast cells are not killed off by &lt;a href=\"cold%20shock\"&gt;cold shock&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally winemakers want to add enough inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1\u00a0gram per gallon (or 25\u00a0grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.\nSimilarly, re-hydration procedures will also vary depending on the manufacturer and winery. Yeast is often inoculated in a volume of water or grape must that is 5\u201310 times the weight of the dry yeast. This liquid is often brought to temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) prior to the introduction of the yeast (though some yeast strains may need temperatures below 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F)) to allow the cells to disperse easily rather than clump and sink to the bottom of the container. The heat activation also allows the cells to quickly reestablish their membrane barrier before soluble &lt;a href=\"cytoplasmic\"&gt;cytoplasmic&lt;/a&gt; components escape the cell. Re-hydration at lower temperatures can greatly reduce the viability of the yeast with up to 60% cell death if the yeast is re-hydrated at 15\u00a0\u00b0C (60\u00a0\u00b0F). The culture is then stirred and aerated to incorporate oxygen into the culture which the yeast uses in the synthesis of needed survival factors.\nThe temperature of the starter culture is then slowly reduced, often by the graduated addition of must to get within 5\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u201318\u00a0\u00b0F) of the must that the culture will be added to. This is done to avoid the sudden cold shock that the yeast cells may experience if the starter culture was added directly to the must itself which can kill up to 60% of the culture. Additionally, surviving cells exposed to cold shock tend to see an increase in hydrogen sulfide production.\nNutritional needs of wine yeast.\nIn order to successfully complete a fermentation with minimum to no negative attributes being added to the wine, yeast needs to have the full assortment of its nutritional needs met. These include not only an available energy source (carbon in the form of sugars such as glucose) and &lt;a href=\"yeast%20assimilable%20nitrogen\"&gt;yeast assimilable nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"amino%20acids\"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; or YAN) but also &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;s (such as &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"vitamin\"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt;s (such as &lt;a href=\"thiamin\"&gt;thiamin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"riboflavin\"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt;) that serve as important growth and survival factors. Among the other nutritional needs of wine yeast:\nMany of these nutrients are available in the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as &lt;a href=\"diammonium%20phosphate\"&gt;diammonium phosphate&lt;/a&gt; (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as \"Go-Ferm\" and \"Ferm-K\") and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some &lt;a href=\"Italian%20wine\"&gt;Italian wine&lt;/a&gt; regions is the \"&lt;a href=\"ripasso\"&gt;ripasso&lt;/a&gt;\" method of adding the leftover &lt;a href=\"pomace\"&gt;pomace&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"pressing%20%28wine%29\"&gt;pressing&lt;/a&gt; of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.\n\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" can assimilate nitrogen from both inorganic (ammonia and &lt;a href=\"ammonium\"&gt;ammonium&lt;/a&gt;) and organic forms (amino acids, particularly &lt;a href=\"arginine\"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;). As yeast cells die, enzymes within the cells begin &lt;a href=\"Autolysis%20%28biology%29\"&gt;autolyzing&lt;/a&gt; by breaking down the cell, including the amino acids. This autolysis of the cell provides an available nitrogen source for the still-fermenting and viable yeast cells. However, this autolysis can also release sulfur-link compounds (such as the breakdown of amino acid &lt;a href=\"cysteine\"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;) which can combine with other molecules and react with alcohol to create volatile &lt;a href=\"thiols\"&gt;thiols&lt;/a&gt; that can contribute to a \"stinky fermentation\" or later development into various wine faults.\nThe role of oxygen.\nYeasts are &lt;a href=\"facultative%20anaerobes\"&gt;facultative anaerobes&lt;/a&gt; meaning that they can exist in both the presence and absence of oxygen. While fermentation is traditionally thought of as an &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Aanaerobic\"&gt;anaerobic&lt;/a&gt; process done in the absence of oxygen, early exposure of the yeast to oxygen can be a vital component in the successful completion of that fermentation. This is because oxygen is important in the synthesis of cell \"survival factors\" such as &lt;a href=\"ergosterol\"&gt;ergosterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lanosterol\"&gt;lanosterol&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"sterols\"&gt;sterols&lt;/a&gt; are important in maintaining the &lt;a href=\"selective%20permeability\"&gt;selective permeability&lt;/a&gt; of the yeast cell membrane which becomes critical as the yeast becomes exposed to increasing &lt;a href=\"osmotic%20pressure\"&gt;osmotic pressure&lt;/a&gt; and levels of alcohol in the wine. As a waste product of its own metabolism, alcohol is actually very toxic to yeast cells. Yeast with weak survival factors and lacking sterols may succumb to these conditions before fermenting a wine to complete dryness, leaving a stuck fermentation.\nCultured yeasts that are freeze-dried and available for inoculation of wine must are deliberately grown in commercial labs in high oxygen/low sugar conditions that favor the development of these survival factors. One of the reasons that some winemakers prefer using inoculated yeast is the predictability of fermentation due to the high level of survival factors that cultured yeast are assured of having without necessarily needing to expose the wine to additional levels of oxygen. Winemakers using \"ambient\" yeasts that are resident in their winery may not have this same assurance of survival factors and may need to compensate with other winemaking techniques.\nWild non-\"Saccharomyces\" yeasts often need a much greater exposure to oxygen in order to build up survival factors which is why many of these yeasts are often found living oxidatively as \"film yeast\" on the surface of wines in tanks or barrels.\nWine faults related to yeast.\nEither directly or indirectly, wine yeast can be a culprit behind a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"wine%20faults\"&gt;wine faults&lt;/a&gt;. These can include the presence of \"&lt;a href=\"Off-flavours\"&gt;off flavors&lt;/a&gt;\" and aromas that can be the by-product of some \"wild yeast\" fermentation such as those by species within the genera of \"Kloeckera\" and \"Candida\". Even the common wine yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" can be behind some wine faults with some strains of the yeast known to produce higher than ideal levels of &lt;a href=\"acetic%20acid\"&gt;acetic acid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"acetaldehyde\"&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; and volatile sulfur compounds such as &lt;a href=\"thiols\"&gt;thiols&lt;/a&gt;. Also any yeast can have a low tolerance to nutritional deficiencies, temperature fluctuation or extremes and excessive or low sugar levels that may lead to a &lt;a href=\"stuck%20fermentation\"&gt;stuck fermentation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the presence of &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; several species of \"Candida\" and \"Pichia\" can create a &lt;a href=\"Biofilm\"&gt;film surface&lt;/a&gt; on top of the wine in the tank of barrel. Allowed to go unchecked, these yeasts can rapidly deplete the available free sulfur compounds that keeps a wine protected from oxidation and other &lt;a href=\"microbial\"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt; attack. The presence of these yeasts is often identified by elevated levels of &lt;a href=\"volatile%20acidity\"&gt;volatile acidity&lt;/a&gt;, particularly acetic acid. Some strains of \"Pichia\" will metabolize acetic acid (as well as &lt;a href=\"ethyl%20acetate\"&gt;ethyl acetate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"isoamyl%20acetate\"&gt;isoamyl acetate&lt;/a&gt; that may also be produced) with the side-effect of substantially decreasing the &lt;a href=\"titratable%20acidity\"&gt;titratable acidity&lt;/a&gt; and shifting the pH of wine upwards to levels that make the wine prone to attack by other spoilage microbes. Commonly called \"film yeast\", these yeasts are distinguished from the &lt;a href=\"flor\"&gt;flor&lt;/a&gt; sherry yeast that are usually welcomed by winemakers in producing the delicate fino-style wines.\nGrowth of many unfavorable wild yeasts is generally slowed at lower cellar temperatures, so many winemakers who wish to inhibit the activities of these yeasts before the more favorable \"Saccharomyces\" yeast kick in, will often chill their must, such as the practice of \"cold soaking\" the must during a pre-fermentation &lt;a href=\"maceration%20%28wine%29\"&gt;maceration&lt;/a&gt; at temperatures between 4\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C (39\u201350\u00a0\u00b0F). Though some species, such as \"Brettanomyces\", will not be inhibited and may even thrive during an extended period of cold soaking.\nBrettanomyces.\nThe wine yeast \"Brettanomyces\" (or \"Brett\") produces very distinctive aroma compounds, &lt;a href=\"4-Ethylphenol\"&gt;4-Ethylphenol&lt;/a&gt; (4-EP) and &lt;a href=\"4-Ethylguaiacol\"&gt;4-Ethylguaiacol&lt;/a&gt; (4-EG), that can have a wine being described as smelling like a \"barnyard\", \"wet saddle\" or \"band-aid\". To some winemakers and with some wine styles (such as &lt;a href=\"Pinot%20noir\"&gt;Pinot noir&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Burgundy%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;), a limited amount of these compounds could be considered a positive attribute that adds to the complexity of wine. To other winemakers and with other wine styles (such as &lt;a href=\"Riesling\"&gt;Riesling&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mosel%20%28wine%29\"&gt;Mosel&lt;/a&gt;), the presence of any Brett will be considered a fault. &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3AFruit%20fly\"&gt;Fruit flies&lt;/a&gt; are common &lt;a href=\"vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt; in the transfer of \"Brettanomyces\" between tanks and even nearby wineries.\nAs a fermentation yeast, \"Brettanomyces\" can usually ferment a wine up to 10\u201311% alcohol levels before they die out. Sometimes \"Brettanomyces\" already present in a wine that has been inoculated with \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" will out compete the \"Saccharomyces\" strain for nutrients and even inhibit it due to the high levels of acetic acid, &lt;a href=\"decanoic%20acid\"&gt;decanoic acid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"octanoic%20acid\"&gt;octanoic acid&lt;/a&gt; that many strains of \"Brettanomyces\" can produce.\nOnce Brett is in a winery, it is very difficult to control even with strict hygiene and the discarding of barrels and equipment that has previously come into contact with \"Bretty\" wine. This is because many species of \"Brettanomyces\" can use a wide variety of carbon sources in wine and grape must, including &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt;, for metabolism. Additionally, Brett can produce a wide range of by-products that could influence the wine beyond just the 4-EP and 4-EG compounds previously discussed. Many of these compounds, such as the \"footprints\" of the 4-EP and 4-EG, will still remain in the wine even after yeast cells die and are removed by racking and sterile filtration.\nExternal links.\n "
