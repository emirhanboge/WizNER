    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval Europe&lt;/a&gt;, a march or mark was, in broad terms, any kind of &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt;land, as opposed to a national \"heartland\". More specifically, a march was a border between &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s or a neutral &lt;a href=\"buffer%20zone\"&gt;buffer zone&lt;/a&gt; under joint control of two states in which different laws might apply. In both of these senses, marches served a political purpose, such as providing warning of &lt;a href=\"Invasion\"&gt;military incursions&lt;/a&gt; or regulating cross-border trade.\nJust as &lt;a href=\"county\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; were traditionally ruled by &lt;a href=\"counts\"&gt;counts&lt;/a&gt;, marches gave rise to titles such as &lt;a href=\"marquess%23United%20Kingdom\"&gt;marquess&lt;/a&gt; (masculine) or marchioness (feminine) in &lt;a href=\"England%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, \"marquis\" (masculine) or \"marquise\" (feminine) in &lt;a href=\"France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"margrave\"&gt;margrave&lt;/a&gt; (; masculine) or margravine (, feminine) in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Germany%23Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and corresponding titles in other European states.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"march\" derives ultimately from a &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-European%20language\"&gt;Proto-Indo-European&lt;/a&gt; root *\"mereg-\", meaning \"edge, boundary\". The root *\"mereg-\" produced &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"margo\" (\"margin\"), &lt;a href=\"Old%20Irish\"&gt;Old Irish&lt;/a&gt; \"mruig\" (\"borderland\"), and &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20language\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Marz%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;marz&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"borderland\"). The &lt;a href=\"Proto-Germanic\"&gt;Proto-Germanic&lt;/a&gt; \"*marko\" gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English%20language\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; word \"mearc\" and &lt;a href=\"Frankish%20language\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; \"marka\", as well as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; \"m\u00f6rk\" meaning \"borderland, forest\", and &lt;a href=\"Derivation%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;derived&lt;/a&gt; from \"merki\" \"boundary, sign\", denoting a borderland between two centres of power. \nIt seems that in Old English \"mark\" meant \"boundary\" or \"sign of a boundary\", and the meaning only later evolved to encompass \"sign\" in general, \"impression\" and \"trace\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt; took its name from &lt;a href=\"West%20Sexaon%20dialect%20%28Old%20English%29\"&gt;West Saxon&lt;/a&gt; \"mearc\" \"marches\", which in this instance referred explicitly to the territory's position on the Anglo-Saxon &lt;a href=\"Offa%27s%20Dyke\"&gt;frontier&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Romano-Britons\"&gt;Romano-British&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nDuring the Frankish &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Carolingian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, usage of the word spread throughout Europe.\nThe name Denmark preserves the Old Norse cognates \"merki\" (\"boundary\") \"m\u00f6rk\" (\"wood\", \"forest\") up to the present. Following the &lt;a href=\"Anschluss\"&gt;Anschluss&lt;/a&gt;, the Nazi German government revived the old name &lt;a href=\"Ostmark_%28Austria%29\"&gt;'Ostmark'&lt;/a&gt; for Austria.\nFrankish Empire and successor states.\nMarca Hispanica.\nAfter some early setbacks, &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;'s son &lt;a href=\"Louis%20the%20Pious\"&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt; ventured beyond the province of &lt;a href=\"Septimania\"&gt;Septimania&lt;/a&gt; and eventually took Barcelona from the &lt;a href=\"Moors\"&gt;Moorish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"emir\"&gt;emir&lt;/a&gt; in 801. Thus he established a foothold in the borderland between the Franks and the Moors. The Carolingian \"Hispanic Marches\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Marca%20Hispanica\"&gt;Marca Hisp\u00e1nica&lt;/a&gt;\") became a buffer zone ruled by a number of feudal lords, among them the &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Count of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. It had its own outlying territories, each ruled by a lesser \"miles\" with armed retainers, who theoretically owed allegiance through a Count to the Emperor or, with less &lt;a href=\"fealty\"&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt;, to his Carolingian and Ottonian successors. Such territory had a \"catl\u00e1\" (\"castellan\" or lord of the castle) in an area largely defined by a day's ride, and the region became known, like Castile at a later date, as \"Catalunya\". Counties in the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the 9th century, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;County of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, included &lt;a href=\"Cerdanya\"&gt;Cerdanya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Girona\"&gt;Girona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Urgell\"&gt;Urgell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early ninth century, Charlemagne issued his new kind of land grant, the \"&lt;a href=\"aprisio\"&gt;aprisio&lt;/a&gt;\", which redisposed land belonging to the Imperial \"&lt;a href=\"fisc\"&gt;fisc&lt;/a&gt;\" in deserted areas, and included special rights and immunities that resulted in a range of independence of action. Historians interpret the \"aprisio\" both as the basis of &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudalism&lt;/a&gt; and in economic and military terms as a mechanism to entice settlers to a depopulated border region. Such self-sufficient landholders would aid the counts in providing armed men in defense of the Frankish &lt;a href=\"frontier\"&gt;frontier&lt;/a&gt;. \"Aprisio\" grants (the first ones were in &lt;a href=\"Septimania\"&gt;Septimania&lt;/a&gt;) emanated directly from the Carolingian king, and they reinforced central loyalties, to counterbalance the local power exercised by powerful marcher counts.\nBut communications were arduous, and the power centre was far away. Primitive &lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; entities developed, self-sufficient and agrarian, each ruled by a small hereditary military elite. The sequence in Catalonia exhibits a pattern that emerges similarly in marches everywhere. The Count is appointed by the king (from 802), the appointment settles on the heirs of a strong count (Sunifred) and the appointment becomes a formality, until the position is declared hereditary (897) and then the County declares itself independent (by Borrell II in 985). At each stage the \"de facto\" situation precedes the \"de jure\" assertion, which merely regularizes an existing fact of life. This is &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudalism&lt;/a&gt; in the larger landscape.\nCertain of the Counts aspired to the characteristically Frankish (Germanic) title \"&lt;a href=\"Margrave\"&gt;Margrave&lt;/a&gt; of the Hispanic March\", a \"margrave\" being a \"graf\" (\"count\") of the march.\nThe early &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Andorra\"&gt;History of Andorra&lt;/a&gt; provides a fairly typical career of another such buffer state, the only modern survivor in the Pyrenees of the Hispanic Marches.\nFrance.\nThe &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20France\"&gt;province of France&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Marche\"&gt;Marche&lt;/a&gt; (), sometimes \"Marche Limousine\", was originally a small border district between the Duchy of Aquitaine and the domains of the Frankish kings in central France, partly of &lt;a href=\"Limousin%20%28province%29\"&gt;Limousin&lt;/a&gt; and partly of &lt;a href=\"Poitou\"&gt;Poitou&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts area was increased during the 13th century and remained the same until the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Marche was bounded on the north by &lt;a href=\"Berry%20%28province%29\"&gt;Berry&lt;/a&gt;, on the east by &lt;a href=\"Bourbonnais\"&gt;Bourbonnais&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auvergne%20%28province%29\"&gt;Auvergne&lt;/a&gt;; on the south by Limousin itself and on the west by Poitou. It embraced the greater part of the modern \"&lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9partement\"&gt;d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Creuse\"&gt;Creuse&lt;/a&gt;, a considerable part of the northern &lt;a href=\"Haute-Vienne\"&gt;Haute-Vienne&lt;/a&gt;, and a fragment of &lt;a href=\"Indre\"&gt;Indre&lt;/a&gt;, up to &lt;a href=\"Saint-Beno%C3%AEt-du-Sault\"&gt;Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Sault&lt;/a&gt;. Its area was about its capital was &lt;a href=\"Charroux%2C%20Vienne\"&gt;Charroux&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%A9ret\"&gt;Gu\u00e9ret&lt;/a&gt;, and among its other principal towns were &lt;a href=\"Dorat%2C%20Vienne\"&gt;Dorat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bellac\"&gt;Bellac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confolens\"&gt;Confolens&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarche first appeared as a separate fief about the middle of the 10th century when &lt;a href=\"William%20III%2C%20duke%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;William III, duke of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;, gave it to one of his vassals named &lt;a href=\"Boso%2C%20Count%20of%20Marche\"&gt;Boso&lt;/a&gt;, who took the title of &lt;a href=\"count\"&gt;count&lt;/a&gt;. In the 12th century it passed to the family of &lt;a href=\"Lusignan\"&gt;Lusignan&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes also &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;Counts of Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt;, until the death of the childless &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hugh\"&gt;Count Hugh&lt;/a&gt; in 1303, when it was seized by King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip IV&lt;/a&gt;. In 1316 it was made an &lt;a href=\"appanage\"&gt;appanage&lt;/a&gt; for his youngest son the Prince, afterwards King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt; and a few years later (1327) it passed into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"family%20of%20Bourbon\"&gt;family of Bourbon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe family of &lt;a href=\"Armagnac%20%28party%29\"&gt;Armagnac&lt;/a&gt; held it from 1435 to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons, and in 1527 it was seized by King &lt;a href=\"Francis%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Francis I&lt;/a&gt; and became part of the domains of the French crown. It was divided into Haute-Marche (i.e. \"Upper Marche\") and Basse-Marche (i.e. \"Lower Marche\"), the estates of the former being in existence until the 17th century. From 1470 until the Revolution the province was under the jurisdiction of the \"&lt;a href=\"parlement\"&gt;parlement&lt;/a&gt;\" of Paris.\nSeveral communes of France are named similarly:\nGermany and Austria.\nThe Germanic tribes that Romans called &lt;a href=\"Marcomanni\"&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/a&gt;, who battled the Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries, were simply the \"men of the borderlands\".\nMarches were territorial organisations created as borderlands in the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Empire\"&gt;Carolingian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and had a long career as purely conventional designations under the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In modern German, \"Mark\" denotes a piece of land that historically was a borderland, as in the following names:\nItaly.\nFrom the Carolingian period onwards the name \"marca\" begins to appear in Italy, first the &lt;a href=\"Marca%20Fermana\"&gt;Marca Fermana&lt;/a&gt; for the mountainous part of &lt;a href=\"Picenum\"&gt;Picenum&lt;/a&gt;, the Marca Camerinese for the district farther north, including a part of &lt;a href=\"Umbria\"&gt;Umbria&lt;/a&gt;, and the Marca Anconitana for the former &lt;a href=\"Pentapolis\"&gt;Pentapolis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ancona\"&gt;Ancona&lt;/a&gt;). In 1080, the \"marca Anconitana\" was given in investiture to &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Guiscard\"&gt;Robert Guiscard&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20VII\"&gt;Pope Gregory VII&lt;/a&gt;, to whom the &lt;a href=\"Matilda%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Countess Matilda&lt;/a&gt; ceded the marches of &lt;a href=\"Camerino\"&gt;Camerino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fermo\"&gt;Fermo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1105, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Henry%20IV\"&gt;Emperor Henry IV&lt;/a&gt; invested &lt;a href=\"Werner%20II%20of%20Spoleto\"&gt;Werner&lt;/a&gt; with the whole territory of the three marches, under the name of the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Ancona\"&gt;March of Ancona&lt;/a&gt;. It was afterwards once more recovered by the Church and governed by papal legates as part of the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt;. The Marche became part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 1860. After &lt;a href=\"Italian%20unification\"&gt;Italian unification&lt;/a&gt; in the 1860s, &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; still controlled territory Italian nationalists &lt;a href=\"Italian%20irredentism\"&gt;still claimed as part of Italy&lt;/a&gt;. One of these territories was &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Littoral\"&gt;Austrian Littoral&lt;/a&gt;, which Italian nationalists began to call the &lt;a href=\"Julian%20March\"&gt;Julian March&lt;/a&gt; because of its positioning and as an act of defiance against the hated Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\"Marche\" were repeated on a miniature level, fringing many of the small territorial states of pre-&lt;a href=\"Risorgimento\"&gt;Risorgimento&lt;/a&gt; Italy with a ring of smaller dependencies on their borders, which represent territorial \"marche\" on a small scale. A map of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Mantua\"&gt;Duchy of Mantua&lt;/a&gt; in 1702 (Braudel 1984, fig 26) reveals the independent, though socially and economically dependent arc of small territories from the &lt;a href=\"principality%20of%20Castiglione\"&gt;principality of Castiglione&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest across the south to the duchy of &lt;a href=\"Mirandola\"&gt;Mirandola&lt;/a&gt; southeast of &lt;a href=\"Mantua\"&gt;Mantua&lt;/a&gt;: the lords of &lt;a href=\"Bozzolo\"&gt;Bozolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabbioneta\"&gt;Sabioneta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dosolo\"&gt;Dosolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guastalla\"&gt;Guastalla&lt;/a&gt;, the count of &lt;a href=\"Novellara\"&gt;Novellare&lt;/a&gt;.\nHungary.\nIn medieval &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; the system of \"gyep\u0171\" and \"gyep\u0171elve\", effective until the mid-13th century, can be considered as marches even though in its organisation it shows major differences from Western European feudal marches. For one thing, the \"gyep\u0171\" was not controlled by a Marquess.\nThe \"Gyep\u0171\" was a strip of land that was specially fortified or made impassable, while \"gyep\u0171elve\" was the mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land beyond it. The \"gyep\u0171elve\" is much more comparable to modern &lt;a href=\"buffer%20zone\"&gt;buffer zone&lt;/a&gt;s than traditional European marches.\nPortions of the \"gyep\u0171\" were usually guarded by tribes who had joined the Hungarian nation and were granted special rights for their services at the borders, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sz%C3%A9kelys\"&gt;Sz\u00e9kelys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pechenegs\"&gt;Pechenegs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cumans\"&gt;Cumans&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Hungarian \"gyep\u0171\" originates from the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; \"yapi\" meaning \"&lt;a href=\"palisade\"&gt;palisade&lt;/a&gt;\". Alternatively, it could be a remnant of ZA\u00b7HIPTO (reference to the \u2018hidden\u2019 forms of inner light) or N\u00b7OPTE (Traveller\u2019s avenues). During the 17th and 18th centuries these borderlands were called Markland in the area of Transylvania that bordered with the Kingdom of Hungary and was controlled by a Count or Countess.\nIberia.\nIn addition to the Carolingian \"Marca Hispanica\", Iberia was home to several marches set up by the native states. The future kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Castile&lt;/a&gt; were founded as marcher counties intended to protect the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Kingdom of Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Caliphate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba\"&gt;Cordoban Emirate&lt;/a&gt;, to the south and east respectively.\nLikewise, C\u00f3rdoba set up its own marches as a buffer to the Christian states to the north. The &lt;a href=\"Upper%20March\"&gt;Upper March&lt;/a&gt; (\"al-Tagr al-A'la\"), centered on &lt;a href=\"Zaragoza\"&gt;Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;, faced the eastern \"Marca Hispanica\" and the western &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;, and included the Distant or Farthest March (\"al-Tagr al-Aqsa\"). The &lt;a href=\"Central%20March\"&gt;Middle March&lt;/a&gt; (\"al-Tagr al-Awsat\"), centred on &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Medinaceli\"&gt;Medinaceli&lt;/a&gt;, faced the western Pyrenees and Asturias. The &lt;a href=\"Lower%20March\"&gt;Lower March&lt;/a&gt; (\"al-Tagr al-Adna\"), centred on &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Spain\"&gt;M\u00e9rida&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Badajoz\"&gt;Badajoz&lt;/a&gt;, facing Le\u00f3n and Portugal. These too would give rise to Kingdoms, the &lt;a href=\"Taifa\"&gt;Taifa&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Taifa%20of%20Zaragoza\"&gt;Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taifa%20of%20Toledo\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taifa%20of%20Badajoz\"&gt;Badajoz&lt;/a&gt;.\nScandinavia.\n&lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; means \"the march of the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20people\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn Norse, \"mark\" meant \"borderlands\" and \"forest\"; in present-day Norwegian and Swedish it has acquired the meaning \"ground\", while in Danish it has come to mean \"field\" or \"grassland\".\n&lt;a href=\"Markland\"&gt;Markland&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse%20language\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt; name of an area in North America discovered by Norwegian &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe forests surrounding Norwegian cities are called \"&lt;a href=\"Marka%2C%20Oslo\"&gt;Marka&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0\u2013 the marches. For example, the forests surrounding &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; are called &lt;a href=\"Nordmarka\"&gt;Nordmarka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%98stmarka\"&gt;\u00d8stmarka&lt;/a&gt; and Vestmarka\u00a0\u2013 i.e. the northern, eastern and western marches.\nIn Norway, note also:\nIn Finland:\nIn &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4rmland\"&gt;V\u00e4rmland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordmark%20Hundred\"&gt;Nordmark Hundred&lt;/a&gt; was the frontier area near the border to Norway. Almost all of it is now a part of &lt;a href=\"%C3%85rj%C3%A4ng%20Municipality\"&gt;\u00c5rj\u00e4ng Municipality&lt;/a&gt;. In the Middle Ages the area was called \"Nordmarkerna\" and was a part of &lt;a href=\"Dalsland\"&gt;Dalsland&lt;/a&gt; and not of V\u00e4rmland.\nBritish Isles.\nThe name of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; kingdom in the midlands of England was &lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Mercia\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; for \"boundary folk\", and the traditional interpretation was that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20people\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; and the Anglo-Saxon invaders, although P. Hunter Blair has argued an alternative interpretation that they emerged along the frontier between the Kingdom of Northumbria and the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Trent\"&gt;River Trent&lt;/a&gt; valley.\nLatinizing the Anglo-Saxon term \"mearc\", the border areas between England and Wales were collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Marches\"&gt;Welsh Marches&lt;/a&gt; (\"marchia Wallia\"), while the native Welsh lands to the west were considered Wales Proper (\"pura Wallia\"). The &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; lords in the Welsh Marches were to become the new &lt;a href=\"Marcher%20Lord\"&gt;Marcher Lord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe title \"&lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20March\"&gt;Earl of March&lt;/a&gt;\" is at least two distinct &lt;a href=\"Feudalism\"&gt;feudal title&lt;/a&gt;s: one in the northern marches, as an alternative title for the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Dunbar\"&gt;Earl of Dunbar&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1290 in the &lt;a href=\"Peerage%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Peerage of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;); and one, that was held by the family of &lt;a href=\"Mortimer\"&gt;Mortimer&lt;/a&gt; (1328 in the &lt;a href=\"Peerage%20of%20England\"&gt;Peerage of England&lt;/a&gt;), in the west &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Marches\"&gt;Welsh Marches&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Marches\"&gt;Scottish Marches&lt;/a&gt; is a term for the border regions on both sides of the border between England and Scotland. From the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest\"&gt;Norman conquest&lt;/a&gt; of England until the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20James%20VI%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;King James VI of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, who also became &lt;a href=\"King%20James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;King James I of England&lt;/a&gt;, border clashes were common and the monarchs of both countries relied on &lt;a href=\"Marcher%20Lords\"&gt;Marcher Lords&lt;/a&gt; to defend the frontier areas known as the Marches. They were hand-picked for their suitability for the challenges the responsibilities presented.\n&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Dunbar%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Dunbar\"&gt;Patrick Dunbar, 8th Earl of Dunbar&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Earls%20of%20Northumbria\"&gt;Earls of Northumbria&lt;/a&gt; was recognized in the end of the 13th century to use the name March as his earldom in Scotland, otherwise known as Dunbar, Lothian, and Northumbrian border.\n&lt;a href=\"Roger%20Mortimer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20March\"&gt;Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regent\"&gt;Regent&lt;/a&gt; of England together with &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20of%20France\"&gt;Isabella of France&lt;/a&gt; during the minority of her son, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt;, was a usurper who had deposed, and allegedly arranged the murder of, King Edward II. He was created an earl in September 1328 at the height of his \"&lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt;\" rule. His wife was &lt;a href=\"Joan%20de%20Geneville%2C%202nd%20Baroness%20Geneville\"&gt;Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville&lt;/a&gt;, whose mother, &lt;a href=\"Jeanne%20of%20Lusignan\"&gt;Jeanne of Lusignan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the heiresses of the French &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20La%20Marche\"&gt;Counts of La Marche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Angouleme\"&gt;Angouleme&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis family, &lt;a href=\"Mortimer\"&gt;Mortimer&lt;/a&gt; Lords of &lt;a href=\"Wigmore%20Castle\"&gt;Wigmore&lt;/a&gt;, had been border lords and leaders of defenders of Welsh marches for centuries. He selected \"March\" as the name of his earldom for several reasons: Welsh marches referred to several counties, whereby the title signified superiority compared to usual single county-based earldoms. Mercia was an ancient kingdom. His wife's ancestors had been Counts of La Marche and Angouleme in France.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, a hybrid system of marches existed which was condemned as barbaric at the time. The Irish marches constituted the territory between English and Irish-dominated lands, which appeared as soon as the English did and were called by King John to be fortified. By the 14th century, they had become defined as the land between &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Ireland. Local Anglo-Irish and Gaelic chieftains who acted as powerful spokespeople were recognised by the Crown and given a degree of independence. Uniquely, the keepers of the marches were given the power to terminate indictments. In later years, wardens of the Irish marches took Irish tenants.\nTitles.\n&lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt;, marchese and &lt;a href=\"margrave\"&gt;margrave&lt;/a&gt; (\"Markgraf\") all had their origins in feudal lords who held trusted positions in the borderlands. The English title was a foreign importation from France, tested out tentatively in 1385 by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt;, but not naturalized until the mid-15th century, and now more often spelled \"&lt;a href=\"marquess\"&gt;marquess&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRelated concepts.\nArmenia.\nThe specific &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;subdivisions of Armenia&lt;/a&gt; are each called \"&lt;a href=\"Marz%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;marz, \u0574\u0561\u0580\u0566&lt;/a&gt;\" (pl. \"marzer, \u0574\u0561\u0580\u0566\u0565\u0580\"), a loanword from &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Balkans.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Krajina\"&gt;Krajina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Military%20Frontier\"&gt;Military Frontier&lt;/a&gt;.\nChina.\nIn their initial development during the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Zhou\"&gt;later Zhou dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"commandery%20%28China%29\"&gt;commanderies&lt;/a&gt; (\"j\u00f9n\") functioned as marches, ranking below the &lt;a href=\"duke%20%28China%29\"&gt;duke&lt;/a&gt;s' and &lt;a href=\"wang%20%28Chinese%20title%29\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20feudalism\"&gt;original fiefs&lt;/a&gt; and below the more secure and populous &lt;a href=\"county%20%28China%29\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; (\"xi\u00e0n\"). As the commanderies formed the front lines between the &lt;a href=\"Warring%20States\"&gt;major states&lt;/a&gt;, however, their military strength and strategic importance were typically much greater than the counties'.\nOver time, however, the commanderies were &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20the%20administrative%20divisions%20of%20China\"&gt;eventually developed&lt;/a&gt; into regular provinces and then discontinued entirely during the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt; reforms.\nJapan.\nThe European concept of \"marches\" applies just as well to the fief of &lt;a href=\"Matsumae%20clan\"&gt;Matsumae clan&lt;/a&gt; on the southern tip of Hokkaid\u014d which was at Japan's northern border with the &lt;a href=\"Ainu%20people\"&gt;Ainu people&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hokkaid%C5%8D\"&gt;Hokkaid\u014d&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Ezo\"&gt;Ezo&lt;/a&gt; at the time. In 1590, this land was granted to the Kakizaki clan, who took the name Matsumae from then on. The Lords of Matsumae, as they are sometimes called, were exempt from owing rice to the \"&lt;a href=\"sh%C5%8Dgun\"&gt;sh\u014dgun&lt;/a&gt;\" in tribute, and from the \"&lt;a href=\"sankin-k%C5%8Dtai\"&gt;sankin-k\u014dtai&lt;/a&gt;\" system established by &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20Ieyasu\"&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu&lt;/a&gt;, under which most lords (\"&lt;a href=\"daimy%C5%8D\"&gt;daimy\u014d&lt;/a&gt;s\") had to spend half the year at court (in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Edo\"&gt;Edo&lt;/a&gt;).\nBy guarding the border, rather than conquering or colonizing Ezo, the Matsumae, in essence, made the majority of the island an Ainu reservation. This also meant that Ezo, and the &lt;a href=\"Kurile%20Islands\"&gt;Kurile Islands&lt;/a&gt; beyond, were left essentially open to Russian colonization. However, the Russians never did colonize Ezo, and the marches were officially eliminated during the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20Restoration\"&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century, when the Ainu came under Japanese control, and Ezo was renamed Hokkaid\u014d, and annexed to Japan.\nUkraine.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;\", from the Moscow-centric Russian viewpoint,\nfunctioned as a \"borderland\" or \"march\" and gained its current &lt;a href=\"name%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;, which is derived from a Slavic term of the same meaning (see above for similar in Slovenia, etc.), ultimately from this function. This, though, was merely a continuation of a semi-formal arrangement with the Poles, before escalating feuds, political infighting in Poland, and religious differences (mainly Eastern Orthodox vs. Roman Catholic) saw a loose coalition of Ukrainian lords and independent landowners collectively known as the Cossacks shift to ally with the Russian Empire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cossacks\"&gt;Cossacks&lt;/a&gt; became a significant part of Russian military history in their role as military border/buffer-troops in the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Fields\"&gt;Wild Fields&lt;/a&gt; of Ukraine. The &lt;a href=\"Tatar%20slave%20raids%20in%20East%20Slavic%20lands\"&gt;Tatar slave raids in East Slavic lands&lt;/a&gt; brought considerable devastation and depopulation to this area prior to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Zaporozhian%20Cossacks\"&gt;Zaporozhian Cossacks&lt;/a&gt;. As settlement advanced and the borders moved, the Tsars transferred or formed Cossack units to perform similar functions on other borderlands/marches further south and east in (for example) the Kuban and in Siberia, forming (for example) the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Cossack%20Host\"&gt;Black Sea Cossack Host&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kuban%20Cossacks\"&gt;Kuban Cossack Host&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amur%20Cossacks\"&gt;Amur Cossack Host&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nAttribution:"
