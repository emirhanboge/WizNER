The club play in the &lt;a href=\"Student%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;SRL London/South&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club were reformed in Winter 2007 after a ten-year hiatus. From the very beginning close links were formed with the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; and . The latter oversaw the new side as they found their feet, ensuring that the coaching was of a suitable standard and promoting the team both on campus, and through their website until a good group of players were there to build on.\nAfter six months under the affiliation of the &lt;a href=\"London%20League%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;London Amateur Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;, the club completed its first three games (which included a small scale tour to Wales) and obtained their first victory when they defeated Aberystwyth University in the return match from that trip in October 2008.\nThe club is now thriving within the university both socially and competitively, having won the league in the 2012/13 season and then reclaiming the title in 2014/15 season. Over the past 4 years the club has also produced a handful of players who have gone on to represent England students and a number of professional teams. They are always welcoming new players to the club to both introduce students to Rugby League and build on pre-existing rugby skills."
