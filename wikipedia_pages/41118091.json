    "text": "Zahir Belounis (born 15 February 1980) is a French-Algerian &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who plays as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;. The refusal of authorities in &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, where he was playing football, to grant him an &lt;a href=\"Kafala%20system%23Qatar\"&gt;exit visa&lt;/a&gt; after a pay dispute, brought him to wider attention.\nCareer.\nBelounis played as a striker for lower league French and Swiss clubs before moving to Qatar in 2007. He played for the &lt;a href=\"El%20Jaish%20SC\"&gt;El Jaish SC&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was in a dispute over unpaid wages from 2010 but because in Qatar, the employer has control over exit visas under the &lt;a href=\"Kafala%20system%23Qatar\"&gt;Kafala system&lt;/a&gt;, he was unable to leave the country. Belounis threatened to go on hunger strike to draw attention to his cause and in 2013, he wrote an &lt;a href=\"open%20letter\"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2022%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2022 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors &lt;a href=\"Zinedine%20Zidane\"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pep%20Guardiola\"&gt;Pep Guardiola&lt;/a&gt; to garner support. &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; declined to take up his case as Belounis had appealed via the Qatari authorities and not through FIFA.\nAfter 19 months he was granted an exit visa and left Qatar to return to France. Belounis admitted that during his time awaiting an exit visa he had planned to leave Qatar illegally, considered suicide and had turned to alcohol to help him cope with his situation.\nThe case drew attention to Qatari employment laws and their interaction with their hosting of the &lt;a href=\"2022%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2022 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;."
