    "text": "Francisco Javier Santamar\u00eda (September 10, 1886 in Cacaos in &lt;a href=\"Jalapa%2C%20Tabasco\"&gt;Jalapa Municipality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tabasco\"&gt;Tabasco&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 March 1, 1963 in &lt;a href=\"Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veracruz%20de%20Ignacio%20de%20la%20Llave\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;) was an influential &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20people\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; writer and politician who is best remembered for his contributions to the study of &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20literature\"&gt;Mexican literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lexicography\"&gt;lexicography&lt;/a&gt;; he variously worked or published as a &lt;a href=\"bibliographer\"&gt;bibliographer&lt;/a&gt;, essayist, geographer, journalist, judge, lawyer, lexicographer, &lt;a href=\"linguist\"&gt;linguist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"naturalist\"&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pedagogue\"&gt;pedagogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philologist\"&gt;philologist&lt;/a&gt;, and poet. He also served as a &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Senate\"&gt;Senator of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; and as &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Tabasco\"&gt;Governor of the State of Tabasco&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and work.\nFrancisco Javier Santamar\u00eda was born in 1886 in the \"&lt;a href=\"rancher%C3%ADa\"&gt;rancher\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;\" of Cacaos, to a \"&lt;a href=\"criollo%20%28people%29\"&gt;criollo&lt;/a&gt;\" family of modest means. He began his schooling in &lt;a href=\"Macuspana\"&gt;Macuspana&lt;/a&gt; and completed his studies in &lt;a href=\"Villahermosa\"&gt;Villahermosa&lt;/a&gt; (then called San Juan Bautista) at the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20de%20Tabasco\"&gt;Instituto Ju\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt;, where he graduated with a teaching degree. He subsequently moved to &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; to study law, obtaining his license in 1912.\nBeginning at a young age Santamar\u00eda demonstrated a talent for composition and an appreciation for the &lt;a href=\"belles-lettres\"&gt;belles-lettres&lt;/a&gt; which would eventually evolve into a prolific career as a writer, lexicographer and linguist; his two most often cited works are the \"Diccionario General de Americanismos\" and the \"Diccionario de Mejicanismos\", the second of which is a continuation and completion of &lt;a href=\"Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Icazbalceta\"&gt;Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta's&lt;/a&gt; original project.\nAt the start of his political career Santamar\u00eda was an outspoken critic of &lt;a href=\"Plutarco%20El%C3%ADas%20Calles\"&gt;Plutarco El\u00edas Calles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Laborist%20Party%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Partido Labortista&lt;/a&gt; over which he presided. He was also a close friend and political associate of &lt;a href=\"Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Amaro%23Amaro%20as%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;General Francisco R. Serrano&lt;/a&gt; (an inveterate enemy of Calles's), and supported the latter's presidential campaign for the 1925-1928 term, an enterprise which would ultimately end in the murderous defeat of Serrano and his closest associates. Santamar\u00eda would be the only one on El\u00edas Calles's &lt;a href=\"contract%20killing\"&gt;hit list&lt;/a&gt; to not fall the night of October 2, 1927, an event known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Huitzilac\"&gt;Huitzilac&lt;/a&gt; Massacre,\" which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"summary%20execution\"&gt;summary execution&lt;/a&gt;s of Serrano and twenty six other generals, and which President &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Obreg%C3%B3n\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; ordered out of fear of military rebellion. His escape and survival would, however, result in years of exile and poverty in the U.S., an account of which he gives in \"Cr\u00f3nicas del destierro: Desde la ciudad de hierro\" (Chronicles of Exile: From the Iron City).\nAfter returning to Mexico Santamar\u00eda re-entered politics by joining the &lt;a href=\"Institutional%20Revolutionary%20Party\"&gt;Institutional Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; (PRI); eventually going on to serve as a Senator of the Republic for &lt;a href=\"Tabasco\"&gt;Tabasco&lt;/a&gt; from 1940 to 1946. Immediately after the conclusion of his term he was selected by the party as its candidate for the governorship of Tabasco, competed against three opponents and won handily, reportedly receiving 95% of the votes. As governor he worked to improve his state's educational system and general level of cultural and technological development, while continuing to write books and essays on a variety of subjects.\nFrancisco Javier Santamar\u00eda was a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Anumerary\"&gt;numerary&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=\"Academia%20Mexicana%20de%20la%20Lengua\"&gt;Academia Mexicana de la Lengua&lt;/a&gt; and held &lt;a href=\"Chair%20%28official%29\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; 23."
