    "title": "John Ziegler (talk show host)",
    "text": "John Ziegler (born March 28, 1967) is a former &lt;a href=\"Talk%20radio\"&gt;radio program&lt;/a&gt; host, documentary film writer/director, and conservative journalist.\nZiegler's most prominent work in radio has been as the evening (7-10 PM) host of a radio talk show called \"The John Ziegler Show\" on &lt;a href=\"KFI%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KFI&lt;/a&gt; AM 640 in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, from January 12, 2004, until November 13, 2007. \"&lt;a href=\"Talkers%20Magazine\"&gt;Talkers Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" listed John Ziegler as number 54 on their \"Heavy Hundred\" list of the most important U.S. radio talk show hosts in 2007.\nHe co-hosted, with Leah Brandon, a Sunday evening radio program, the \"John and Leah Show\", which was nationally syndicated and in 2016, was considered the 99th most influential talk shows by \"Talkers Magazine\", and a staff columnist for &lt;a href=\"Mediaite\"&gt;Mediaite&lt;/a&gt;. He makes appearances on television cable news as a conservative pundit.\nEarly life and education.\nZiegler was born in a U.S. Army post in &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and grew up as the eldest son of a financial manager in the small village of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Crossing%2C%20PA\"&gt;Washington Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bucks%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Bucks County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. He was a standout golfer in high school, being named High School Golfer of the Year by the Bucks County Courier Times. In 1985, Ziegler graduated from the Catholic &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Ghost%20Preparatory%20School\"&gt;Holy Ghost Preparatory School&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Bensalem%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Bensalem, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. He then attended &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20University\"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1989 with a degree in Government and a minor in Theology and Philosophy. While attending Georgetown, he &lt;a href=\"Letterman%20%28sports%29\"&gt;lettered&lt;/a&gt; in golf for three years.\nConcerning his family's religious background, Ziegler has stated that he \"grew up in an incredibly, very strict &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; family on both sides, my mother and my father's side. I've got numerous aunts who've been in the convent. I went to Catholic high school, Catholic college, as did almost all of my relatives, so, I mean, I'm very steeped in Catholicism\". Ziegler is, however, an &lt;a href=\"agnostic\"&gt;agnostic&lt;/a&gt;, referring to himself as a \"recovering Catholic\".\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from college, Ziegler became a sportscaster, moving his way up to a full-time position at &lt;a href=\"WTOV\"&gt;WTOV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. He left the position to write a book about high school football in &lt;a href=\"Steubenville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Steubenville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, called \"Dynasty of the Crossroads\". After the book, he took a position as a sportscaster at &lt;a href=\"WRAZ%20%28TV%29\"&gt;WRAZ&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, but was fired in 1995 after making what he describes as an \"incredibly tame\" joke about his belief that &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson\"&gt;O. J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt; was guilty.\nHe then began a career in talk radio, working at various stations before ending up at &lt;a href=\"WWTN\"&gt;WWTN&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nashville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where he was fired after having said the word \"&lt;a href=\"nigger\"&gt;nigger&lt;/a&gt;\" on the air, in, according to Ziegler, \"a rather academic discussion about the way whites and blacks view each other\". Ziegler has explained this event as him referencing what the boxer &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tyson\"&gt;Mike Tyson&lt;/a&gt; said at a press conference, where Tyson referred to himself using that word. He then began writing columns for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer\"&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Daily%20News\"&gt;Philadelphia Daily News&lt;/a&gt;\" and co-hosted a talk show on Comcast's &lt;a href=\"CN8\"&gt;CN8&lt;/a&gt; Television Network, which later resulted in his winning a regional &lt;a href=\"Emmy\"&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2002, wanting to return to radio, Ziegler was hired by &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, radio station &lt;a href=\"WHAS%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WHAS&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, his tenure did not last long, as during a \"Ask John Anything\" segment, he discussed Darcie Divita, a former &lt;a href=\"LA%20Lakers\"&gt;LA Lakers&lt;/a&gt; cheerleader and &lt;a href=\"WDRB\"&gt;WDRB&lt;/a&gt; morning television host with whom Ziegler had a relationship until Divita broke up with him.\nIn 2003, while still employed by WHAS, he joined forces with Louisville &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and current &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%27s%203rd%20congressional%20district\"&gt;3rd district Congressional&lt;/a&gt; Representative &lt;a href=\"John%20Yarmuth\"&gt;John Yarmuth&lt;/a&gt; to debate political issues on the weekly &lt;a href=\"WAVE%20%28TV%29\"&gt;WAVE&lt;/a&gt; program \"Yarmuth &amp; Ziegler\", with Yarmuth taking the &lt;a href=\"progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; side and Ziegler the &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; side. This gig lasted through November of that year. In 2006, Ziegler supported the Yarmuth election campaign for Kentucky's 3rd congressional district, both financially and as a political adviser. Yarmuth won the election to Congress, defeating his incumbent Republican opponent &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Northup\"&gt;Anne Northup&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn January 12, 2004, Ziegler began work at KFI as a late evening host. As both WHAS and KFI are owned by &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Channel%20Communications\"&gt;Clear Channel&lt;/a&gt;, this placed him in the unusual situation of having been fired and re-hired by the same company within a short time frame. He moved to the 7-10 p.m. slot on February 21, 2005. In November 2007, he left KFI.\nZiegler was the focus of &lt;a href=\"David%20Foster%20Wallace\"&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;'s cover story in the April 2005 \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Atlantic%20Monthly\"&gt;Atlantic Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\", which examined the American talk radio industry through the lens of \"The John Ziegler Show\". Ziegler viewed the article as \"a partial hit piece;\" in response to the article, he wrote an obituary of Wallace following his death in 2008, stating that Wallace \"was an overrated writer in life. His suicide should not be used to elevate him even further beyond what he deserved, in death.\"\n\"The John Ziegler Show\".\nKFI AM 640.\nJohn Ziegler was the evening (7-10 PM) host of a radio talk show called \"The John Ziegler Show\" on &lt;a href=\"KFI%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KFI&lt;/a&gt; AM 640 in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt; from January 12, 2004 until November 13, 2007.\nThe program was mostly news-based political commentary, but it also brought up other issues such as events happening in Ziegler's personal life. The John Ziegler Show was advertised as \"Getting it Right at Night\" and a common catchphrase that Ziegler used to describe the show was \"three hours of rationality in a world of ever increasing insanity\".\nZiegler was suspended for two days in 2006 following an on-air confrontation with John Kobylt of KFI's &lt;a href=\"John%20and%20Ken%20Show\"&gt;John and Ken Show&lt;/a&gt;. On November 13, 2007, the day after he announced his departure from KFI, Ziegler broadcast his last show. He told a reporter that the decision was due to mental and physical exhaustion, and to his work on a documentary.\nKGIL 1260 AM.\nIn June 2009, Ziegler began a show on Los Angeles news/talk radio station &lt;a href=\"KMZT%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KGIL 1260 AM&lt;/a&gt;, which ran from 11 AM until 1 PM. weekdays.\nNationally syndicated program.\nBeginning November 2, 2014, Ziegler rejoined Brandon to host the \"John and Leah Show\" on &lt;a href=\"KHTS%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KHTS&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Clarita, California. In March 2015, the program became nationally syndicated through Envision Networks, with 24 stations nationwide doing business under the name \"Free Speech Broadcasting Network\". The program moved its home base to &lt;a href=\"KRLA\"&gt;KRLA&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in August 2015. \"John and Leah\" was named as one of the 100 most influential radio talk shows in the United States by \"Talkers Magazine\" in 2016, coming in at #99. Leah Brandon left the show in November 2016.\nDocumentaries.\nAfter leaving his talk show on KFI AM 640, Ziegler was involved in two documentary film projects. In August 2008, John Ziegler and producer &lt;a href=\"David%20Bossie\"&gt;David Bossie&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20United%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Citizens United&lt;/a&gt; premiered a documentary co-produced, written and directed by Ziegler entitled \"Blocking The Path to 9/11\", which revisits the political controversy about the ABC docudrama miniseries \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20to%209/11\"&gt;The Path to 9/11&lt;/a&gt;\". Through interviews with the \"Path to 9/11\" filmmakers and others, news clips about the controversy, and footage from the miniseries, the documentary makes the claim that Disney/ABC ultimately shelved plans to release a DVD of the miniseries as a result of pressure from the political left, specifically the Clintons. As noted in the documentary, Disney/ABC denies this and claims the move was merely a business decision. But commission member Richard Ben-Veniste said that the miniseries misrepresented facts presented in the 9/11 Commission report. Two FBI agents also criticized the film's accuracy. Thomas E. Nicoletti was hired by the filmmakers as a consultant, but quit, saying \"There were so many inaccuracies...I'm well aware of what's dramatic license and what's historical inaccuracy,\" Nicoletti said. \"And this had a lot of historical inaccuracy.'\"\nShortly after the 2008 &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Ziegler announced that a documentary titled \"Media Malpractice: How Obama Got Elected\" was in production (the full title was later changed to \"Media Malpractice: How Obama Got Elected And Palin Was Targeted\"). The film claims that a liberal &lt;a href=\"media%20bias%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;bias in the media&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for Barack Obama being elected president. The film was originally released live on the \"Today Show\" on February 23, 2009.\nJerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal documentary.\nZiegler released a 32-minute \"mini-documentary\" on the &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20child%20sex%20abuse%20scandal\"&gt;Penn State child sex abuse scandal&lt;/a&gt;, criticizing media accounts that &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Paterno\"&gt;Joe Paterno&lt;/a&gt; was aware of &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Sandusky\"&gt;Jerry Sandusky&lt;/a&gt;'s abuse of children. The documentary interviews former Penn State players &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Harris\"&gt;Franco Harris&lt;/a&gt; and Christian Marrone, as well as Sandusky's attorney &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Amendola\"&gt;Joe Amendola&lt;/a&gt; and Penn State trustee Anthony Lubrano. They argue that Paterno was not fully informed of Mike McQueary's allegations and thus could not have \"covered up\" the abuse. If financial contributions are received, the documentary will be expanded into a full-length film.\nZiegler interviewed Sandusky from prison and debuted some of that interview live on the \"Today Show\" on March 25, 2013. Ziegler steadfastly maintains that Sandusky was a \"chaste &lt;a href=\"pedophile\"&gt;pedophile&lt;/a&gt;\" and committed no sexual acts with his victims. Ziegler, who initially said he believed Sandusky was guilty of the crimes he was accused of, now believes that Sandusky is innocent. Ziegler's prison interview with Sandusky came under fire by the Paterno family. Paterno family attorney Wick Sollers released a statement, describing it as \"transparently self-serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story\" \nMediaite column.\nZiegler has been a columnist at Mediaite since 2016. His contributions to the site have often been critical of President Donald Trump as well as Trump's progressive opponents. \nRelation with David Foster Wallace.\nThe writer &lt;a href=\"David%20Foster%20Wallace\"&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;'s article \"Host\" is about Ziegler. It quotes\nZiegler refuting a radio phone-in caller about O.J. Simpson \"...because of the history of racism which is real in this country, and which is insidious, the one guy\u2014-the one guy-\u2014who gets the benefit of all of that pain and suffering\nover a hundred years of history in this country is the one guy who deserves it less than anybody else...\" \nWallace says it should be 400 years but Ziegler lives in a bleak and merciless world. The essay was published twice in Atlantic magazine and is the final chapter in Wallace's book \"&lt;a href=\"Consider%20the%20Lobster\"&gt;Consider the Lobster and Other Essays&lt;/a&gt;\", the final published work before Wallace's suicide.\nPersonal life.\nHe is married to Alison Kallik; they have two daughters."
