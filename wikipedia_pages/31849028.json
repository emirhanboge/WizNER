    "text": "Nee Soon Constituency was a &lt;a href=\"Single%20Member%20Constituency\"&gt;single member constituency&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Region%2C%20Singapore\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; area in Singapore that was created in &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20general%20election%2C%201959\"&gt;1959 general elections&lt;/a&gt; and ceased to exist prior to &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20general%20election%2C%201988\"&gt;1988 general elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nNee Soon was one of the rural areas in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Region%2C%20Singapore\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. At its inception in 1959, there were only 8,694 voters even including present-day &lt;a href=\"Ang%20Mo%20Kio\"&gt;Ang Mo Kio&lt;/a&gt; town, whereas wards nearer to the &lt;a href=\"City%20Business%20District\"&gt;city centre&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Kreta%20Ayer\"&gt;Kreta Ayer&lt;/a&gt; had 14,173 voters in a much smaller area.\nThis ward was finally dissolved prior to the &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20general%20election%2C%201988\"&gt;1988 general elections&lt;/a&gt;, with most of the ward forming &lt;a href=\"Nee%20Soon%20South%20SMC\"&gt;Nee Soon South SMC&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;a href=\"Khatib\"&gt;Khatib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yio%20Chu%20Kang\"&gt;Yio Chu Kang&lt;/a&gt; (near &lt;a href=\"Yio%20Chu%20Kang%20MRT%20station\"&gt;Yio Chu Kang MRT station&lt;/a&gt;), and the portion in &lt;a href=\"Yishun\"&gt;Yishun&lt;/a&gt; Central being renamed &lt;a href=\"Nee%20Soon%20Central%20SMC\"&gt;Nee Soon Central SMC&lt;/a&gt; where former opposition MP &lt;a href=\"Cheo%20Chai%20Chen\"&gt;Cheo Chai Chen&lt;/a&gt; made his debut there. The remainder of this constituency was carved into 2 sub-divisions of &lt;a href=\"Chong%20Pang\"&gt;Chong Pang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nee%20Soon%20East%20SMC\"&gt;Nee Soon East&lt;/a&gt;. The latter ward was a part of &lt;a href=\"Sembawang%20GRC\"&gt;Sembawang GRC&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Singaporean%20general%20election%2C%202001\"&gt;2001 general elections&lt;/a&gt; which saw the &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; contest there."
