    "text": "San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n (; usually called simply Tucum\u00e1n) is the capital and largest city of &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Province\"&gt;Tucum\u00e1n Province&lt;/a&gt;, located in northern &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. It is the fifth-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rosario\"&gt;Rosario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mendoza%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Mendoza&lt;/a&gt; and the most important of the northern region. The Spanish &lt;a href=\"conquistador\"&gt;conquistador&lt;/a&gt; founded the city in 1565 in the course of an expedition from present-day &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. Tucum\u00e1n moved to its present site in 1685.\nOverview.\nThe city is bordered on the north by Las Talitas (&lt;a href=\"Taf%C3%AD%20Viejo%2C%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Taf\u00ed Viejo&lt;/a&gt;), on the east by &lt;a href=\"Banda%20del%20R%C3%ADo%20Sal%C3%AD\"&gt;Banda del R\u00edo Sal\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alderetes%20%28Tucum%C3%A1n%29\"&gt;Alderetes&lt;/a&gt; (Cruz Alta), on the west by the city of &lt;a href=\"Yerba%20Buena%2C%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Yerba Buena&lt;/a&gt;, and on the south by Lules.\nThe city is located on the slopes of the Aconquija mountains, the easternmost mountain range before the large &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Chaco\"&gt;Chaco&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Pampas\"&gt;Pampean&lt;/a&gt; flats. It is the commercial center of an irrigated area that produces large quantities of &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tobacco\"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;, giving the province its nickname, the Garden of the Republic. The &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;National University of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; (1914) and the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20University%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North&lt;/a&gt; (1965) are in the city.\nOn July 9, 1816, a &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;congress gathered in Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; declared independence from &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, which did not officially recognize it until 1862. The meeting place of the congress, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;House of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, has been reconstructed as a national monument. After the national government broke down in 1820, the town was capital of the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Republic of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts telephone code is 0381, and its postal codes are T4000 (Center), T4001 (North), T4002 (South) and T4003 (East).\nClimate.\nSan Miguel de Tucuman lies in a transition zone between temperate climates to the south, and subtropical climates to the north. It has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cwa\") under the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;, with vastly more precipitation in the summer than in the winter. The average annual temperature is . The precipitation pattern is monsoonal: out of the that fall annually, most of it falls in the summer months, while the winter months tend to be drier. The average temperature in winter is . July is the coldest month with a mean temperature of . Frosts are uncommon, with some years recording no frosts at all. Usually, when frosts occur, they are light with temperatures rarely falling below . Winters are sunny, averaging 9\u201312 clear days and 9\u201312 overcast days per month. Snow is extremely rare, but in 2007, it reached the city center. There have been other episodes of sleet and snow in the mountains around the city, and in 2010, sleet was reported downtown again, a very rare event.\nSpring and fall are transition seasons. Springs are very short, and by October, summer weather settles in the city, with highs beyond very common. This is due to the dryness of the season: daytime highs are close to those in the summer, when rainfall and clouds are persistent, whereas spring is often sunny and arid. April marks the beginning of the fall, but temperatures remain near summer levels: during the day, and during the night. Rainfall decreases as fall progresses.\nSummers are the hottest and most humid time of year. The average temperature during the summer ranges from . In the summer, one can expect daytime highs ranging from ; at night, are the norm. Much of the rainfall that the city receives occurs during the summer months and cloudy weather tends to be more common, averaging 11\u201313 overcast days and only 2\u20134 clear days per month. Heat waves can push temperatures up to . However, some relief is possible after cold fronts from the south caused by &lt;a href=\"Pampero%20%28wind%29\"&gt;Pampero&lt;/a&gt; winds which brings in cooler air. These winds can be strong following a hot day in advance of the cold fronts.\nThe highest temperature recorded was on October 31, 2009 while the lowest temperature recorded was on July 16, 1962.\nHistory.\nThe first foundation of \"San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n y Nueva Tierra de Promisi\u00f3n\" was on May 31, 1565 by Diego de Villarroel in the Campos de Ibat\u00edn, to the southwest from where the current city is located nowadays. The city was moved to \"La Toma\" (where the old town or \"casco hist\u00f3rico\" is placed today) in 1685, due to the low quality of Ibat\u00edn water.\nOn September 24, 1812, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Battle of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; took place near the city, when the Spanish army coming from the &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Per%C3%BA\"&gt;Alto Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; were defeated by the army led by &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Belgrano\"&gt;Manuel Belgrano&lt;/a&gt;. Belgrano had been committed to step back to &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; by the government of Buenos Aires, but the Tucum\u00e1n inhabitants requested him to resist another Spanish invasion.\nWith his troops almost unarmed and tired but reinforced with local &lt;a href=\"gaucho\"&gt;gaucho&lt;/a&gt;s (self named \"Los decididos de Tucum\u00e1n\"), Belgrano attacked the Spanish army from behind, defeating them and ensuring the Independence of Argentina. After the battle of Tucum\u00e1n, the same army led by Belgrano would achieve another victory in &lt;a href=\"Salta%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Salta&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter those battles, Belgrano established a circular fortress known as \"La Ciudadela\", located from the current Plaza de la Independencia (former Plaza Mayor). Because it had patriot barracks and was located on an intermediate point between the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata\"&gt;R\u00edo de la Plata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Per%C3%BA\"&gt;Alto Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra\"&gt;Santa Cruz de la Sierra&lt;/a&gt;, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n was designated as the venue for the Congress of the Independence. On July 9, 1816, the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;Independence of Argentina&lt;/a&gt; was declared, not only from Spain but from any other foreign domination. The act of the Independence was signed at the &lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Casa de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, also named \"Casa Hist\u00f3rica\" or \"Casa de la Independencia\".\nBy 1850 the city had increased its population considerably, overpassing the estimated registers. Because of that, in 1870 it was proposed that the city be expanded, setting new limits. During those years, the first railway line reached the city, built by &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;-owned &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20Central%20Railway\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway&lt;/a&gt;. The immigrants arriving in the region (most of them were Spanish, Arabic, Jewish, and Italian) influenced the architectural style that adapted to those new cultures, leaving the original &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Colonial%20architecture\"&gt;colonial style&lt;/a&gt; behind. Therefore, new buildings in the city were made in &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eclecticism%20in%20architecture\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; and picturesque styles.\nDuring the first years of the 20th Century the city added for recreational uses, therefore the first great park (similar to those existing in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;) was built. By 1930 the city doubled its population.\nCultural and tourist heritage.\nThe House of Government of Tucum\u00e1n was built in &lt;a href=\"Art%20Nouveau\"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt; style at the end of 19th century. The White Room is commonly used to receive notable people who visit the city.\nIn the city downtown, the San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n Cathedral still preserves some colonial elements and other elements from Italian architecture. The Bas\u00edlica de San Francisco (also declared a historical heritage), the Parroquia de San Roque, Bas\u00edlica del Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento (known as \"Iglesia de Santo Domingo\"), Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Merced and the Iglesia Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Lourdes are some of the most important &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28building%29\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt; of the city.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Casa de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Casa de la Independencia\"), as the site of the declaration of independence of Argentina, is the most significant building in the city. After the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n various people lived in the house and deterioration became visible over the years, which is clearly evident in the famous photo taken by Angel Paganelli in 1869. The &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;Government of Argentina&lt;/a&gt; acquired the historic house in 1874 with a view to its serving as a post office. Starting in the 1880s celebrations took place in the building to commemorate Independence.\nNevertheless, the government did not remodel the house until 1903, when it was demolished almost completely due to its very poor condition. The only room that was preserved from demolition was the room where the Independence was declared by the congressists. In 1942 the house was completely rebuilt, based on the original plans and the picture taken by Paganelli in 1869. For that purpose, the same kind of bricks, tejas (roof tiles) and baldosas (stone floor tiles) were used.\nOther notable buildings of San Miguel include the Teatro San Mart\u00edn (with some elements in neoclassical style), and the Correo Central, made in a mix of styles and a tower inspired in the palaces of &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; (specially &lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Vecchio\"&gt;Palazzo Vecchio&lt;/a&gt;), the old Legislature, the Palace of Justice, the Casino (former Savoy Hotel, built in 1912), the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Avellaneda\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda&lt;/a&gt;, the Colegio Nacional Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre and the Campo de las Carreras, where the battle of Tucum\u00e1n took place and which is now an historical park.\nCultural life and education.\nFor decades, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n has been one of the cultural spots in the country, in part due to the influence of the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;National University of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. It has been the birthplace and/or home of well-known personalities such as folk singer &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Sosa\"&gt;Mercedes Sosa&lt;/a&gt;, author &lt;a href=\"Tomas%20Eloy%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Tomas Eloy Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Rutgers University in the United States; musician &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Estrella\"&gt;Miguel \u00c1ngel Estrella&lt;/a&gt;, artist/architect &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20Saraceno\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s Saraceno&lt;/a&gt;, painter &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lobo%20de%20la%20Vega\"&gt;Luis Lobo de la Vega&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.\nTwo large theatres (San Mart\u00edn and Alberdi) and several smaller and independent theaters offer a wide array of events, including plays, concerts, operas, and ballet, all year round. The \"Septiembre Musical\" is by far the most important cultural event during the year. This music festival, generally held at Independence Square, brings together several local and national artists who perform different musical styles ranging from folk music to rock.\nUniversities in the city include the public &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;National University of Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Technological%20University\"&gt;National Technological University&lt;/a&gt;, and the private (and Catholic) &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20University%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%20T%20University\"&gt;Saint Paul T University&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince August 2008, the city has been the location of trials of high-ranking former military officers charged with war crimes from the 1976\u201383 &lt;a href=\"National%20Reorganization%20Process\"&gt;dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Luciano%20Men%C3%A9ndez\"&gt;Luciano Men\u00e9ndez&lt;/a&gt;, a former colonel, was convicted for crimes against humanity, including the kidnapping and disappearance of senator (Guillermo Vargas Aignasse) on the night of the \"golpe\" (coup) in 1976. Many &lt;a href=\"Abuelas%20de%20la%20Plaza%20de%20Mayo\"&gt;Abuelas de la Plaza de Mayo&lt;/a&gt; (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo) have been seen in and around the Tucum\u00e1n trials. The convictions of Men\u00e9ndez and &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Bussi\"&gt;Ricardo Bussi&lt;/a&gt; were the first of this round of prosecution of military leaders of the Jorge Rafael Videla dictatorship. Their sentencings were seen as symbolic victories for the mothers and grandmothers whose children or husbands were \"&lt;a href=\"Forcibly%20disappeared\"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;\" by the military during that dark period of Argentine history.\nSports.\n&lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;Association football&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular sport in the city. San Miguel's main football clubs are &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20San%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. Club Atletico San Martin is based out of San Miguel de Tucuman and was founded in 1909. This team has won four total national titles (1944, 1988, 2005, and 2007-08) and several regional titles. The longtime rival, Club Atletico Tucuman, is also based in the city of San Miguel de Tucuman but was founded in 1901. This team is the oldest football club in the Tucuman Province and the team has five national titles (1959, 2004, 2005, 2007-08, and 2008-09) and also many regional titles.\n&lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; is also a popular sport, some clubs are Juan Bautista Alberdi Club, Central C\u00f3rdoba Club, Belgrano Club, Villa Luj\u00e1n Club, Tucum\u00e1n BB Club and others. Tucum\u00e1n was one of two co-hosts of the &lt;a href=\"1995%20FIBA%20Americas%20Championship\"&gt;1995 FIBA Americas Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city is also a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; hotbed and hosts the &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20de%20Rugby%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the province's two most successful clubs: &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Tucum\u00e1n Rugby Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Universitario%20Rugby%20Club%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Universitario&lt;/a&gt;. The rugby of Tucum\u00e1n is the second most powerful in the Argentine, behind the Rugby of the Buenos Aires Union. For eight times, the \"Naranjas\" (Oranges) won the &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Argentino\"&gt;Argentine Championship of Unions&lt;/a&gt;; this is the greatest number won by a hinterland union. Other important rugby clubs of the city are &lt;a href=\"Club%20Nataci%C3%B3n%20y%20Gimnasia\"&gt;Nataci\u00f3n y Gimnasia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cardenales%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Cardenales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Lawn%20Tennis%20Club\"&gt;Tucum\u00e1n Lawn Tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Tarcos%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Los Tarcos&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others. The fans of the rugby of Tucum\u00e1n are the most passionate among the Argentines.\nTransport.\nThe city is served by several bus lines that have routes within the city limits, and some others that connect it to the neighbouring cities of Yerba Buena, El Manantial, Taf\u00ed Viejo, Las Talitas, Banda del R\u00edo Sal\u00ed, and Alderetes. San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n enjoys one of the largest bus stations in Argentina. The 30,000 m\u00b2 estaci\u00f3n central de \u00f3mnibus (opened in 1994) is the point from where hundreds of bus services arrive from and depart to almost all of the largest and mid-size cities throughout the country.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Teniente%20General%20Benjam%C3%ADn%20Matienzo%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Teniente General Benjam\u00edn Matienzo International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (TUC/SANT) is the city's airport (though located east of the city, in the neighboring department of Cruz Alta) serving over 290,000 passengers a year. There are daily flights to &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jujuy\"&gt;Jujuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20del%20Estero\"&gt;Santiago del Estero&lt;/a&gt;, Campo Arenal, the &lt;a href=\"Campo%20Arenal%20Aerodrome\"&gt;Minera Alumbrera&lt;/a&gt; Gold Mine, as well as international flights to &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20de%20la%20Sierra\"&gt;Santa Cruz de la Sierra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mauricio%20Gilli%20Aerodrome\"&gt;Mauricio Gilli Aerodrome&lt;/a&gt; is a private airport, located west from the city, for private aviation. It is locally known as Aeroclub.\nThe city has also four &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt;s, with only the &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Mitre%20railway%20station\"&gt;Mitre Railway terminus&lt;/a&gt; operating passenger trains to &lt;a href=\"Retiro%20Mitre%20railway%20station\"&gt;Retiro&lt;/a&gt; in Buenos Aires, with intermediate stops in Santiago del Estero and Santa Fe provinces amongst other stations. The other train station active is &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Belgrano%20railway%20station\"&gt;Belgrano Railway station&lt;/a&gt;, originally built by the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20Central%20Railway\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway&lt;/a&gt; and currently operated by &lt;a href=\"freight%20rail%20transport\"&gt;freight&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Trenes%20Argentinos%20Cargas%20y%20Log%C3%ADstica\"&gt;Trenes Argentinos Cargas y Log\u00edstica&lt;/a&gt;.\nRailway stations in San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n:\nNotes:\nMedia.\nSan Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n is home to two free-to-air television stations (\"&lt;a href=\"Channel%208%20-%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Channel 8&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Channel%2010%20-%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;Channel 10&lt;/a&gt;\"), four newspapers (\"&lt;a href=\"La%20Gaceta%20%28Tucum%C3%A1n%29\"&gt;La Gaceta&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Siglo%20%28Tucum%C3%A1n%29\"&gt;El Siglo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"El Peri\u00f3dico\", \"El Tribuno de Tucum\u00e1n\"), three cable television companies (CCC, ATS, and TCC), and several radio stations.\nHealthcare.\nSan Miguel de Tucuman is part of the Provincial Health System (Sistema Provincial de Salud or SIPROSA). This system divided the Tucuman province into four systematic areas with San Miguel being in its own area. Each area has its own public hospitals and Health Primary Attention Centers for the people. This divisions purpose was to help regulate health care assistance across the population and make it more accessible. Since then, SIPROSA has been a part of a modernizing program with the government in trying to make a successful medical records system. This would collect data from all the different resources and compile it into one database making it a lot easier and quicker for patients to pull up medical history, medical records, or anything of that nature. This is a big step for the Tucuman &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSan Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
