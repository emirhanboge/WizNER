    "text": "The Russian world (; ) is the social totality associated with &lt;a href=\"Russian%20culture\"&gt;Russian culture&lt;/a&gt;. \"Russkiy Mir\" is the core culture of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and is in interaction with the diverse cultures of Russia through traditions, history and the Russian language. It comprises also the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20diaspora\"&gt;Russian diaspora&lt;/a&gt; with its influence in the world. The concept is based on the notion of \"Russianness\", and both have been considered &lt;a href=\"ambiguous\"&gt;ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;. The Russian world and awareness of it arose through &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian history&lt;/a&gt; and was shaped by the respective period.\nHistory.\nBefore and during the Russian Empire.\nOne of the earliest use of the term \"Russian world\" is attributed to the Great Prince &lt;a href=\"Iziaslav%20I%20of%20Kiev\"&gt;Iziaslav I of Kiev&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th century in his praise of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Clement%20I\"&gt;Pope Clement I&lt;/a&gt;: \"with gratitude to that faithful &lt;a href=\"Parable%20of%20the%20talents%20or%20minas\"&gt;slave who increased the talent of his master&lt;/a&gt; - not only in Rome, but everywhere: both in &lt;a href=\"Kherson\"&gt;Kherson&lt;/a&gt; and in the Russian world\" ().\nIn the 16th century Russia was formed as a self-contained world. Unconsciously, the Russian world also absorbed foreign influences from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20world\"&gt;Eastern world&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Orient\"&gt;Orient&lt;/a&gt;, even if the influences were in the context of the evolution of the Russian world rather minor. It was not until the 17th and 18th centuries that the Tsar's throne consciously attempted to Europeanize Russia.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the idea of the Russian world was of &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;nationalistic&lt;/a&gt; type. &lt;a href=\"Vyacheslav%20Nikonov\"&gt;Vyacheslav Nikonov&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Russkiy%20Mir%20Foundation\"&gt;Russkiy Mir Foundation&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the Russian world did not reach beyond Russia proper. He lamented that at these times 1/7th of the &lt;a href=\"world%20population\"&gt;world population&lt;/a&gt; lived in the Russian Empire, while now the ratio is 1/50.\n1990s.\nMajor authors behind the resurrection of the concept in the post-Soviet Russia include , Yefim Ostrovsky, &lt;a href=\"Valery%20Tishkov\"&gt;Valery Tishkov&lt;/a&gt;, Vitaly Skrinnik, Tatyana Poloskova and &lt;a href=\"Natalya%20Narochnitskaya\"&gt;Natalya Narochnitskaya&lt;/a&gt;. Since Russia emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; as still a significantly multiethnic and multicultural country, for the \"Russian idea\" to be unifying, it could not be &lt;a href=\"ethnocentric\"&gt;ethnocentric&lt;/a&gt;, as it was in the doctrine &lt;a href=\"Orthodoxy%2C%20Autocracy%2C%20and%20Nationality\"&gt;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&lt;/a&gt; of the late Russian Empire. In 2000 Shchedrovitsky presented the main ideas of the \"Russian world\" concept in the article \"Russian World and Transnational Russian Characteristics\", among the central ones of which was the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian language&lt;/a&gt;. Andis Kudors of the &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson%20International%20Center%20for%20Scholars\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars&lt;/a&gt;, analyzing Shchedrovitsky's article, concludes that it follows the ideas first laid out by the 18th century philosopher &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder\"&gt;Johann Gottfried Herder&lt;/a&gt; about the influence of language on thinking (which has become known as the principle of &lt;a href=\"linguistic%20relativity\"&gt;linguistic relativity&lt;/a&gt;): the ones who speak Russian come to think Russian, and eventually to act Russian.\nPutin era.\nEventually, the idea of the Russian world was adopted by the Russian administration, and &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; decreed the establishment of the government-sponsored &lt;a href=\"Russkiy%20Mir%20Foundation\"&gt;Russkiy Mir Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.\nA number of observers consider the promotion of the Russian world concept as an element of the &lt;a href=\"revanchist\"&gt;revanchist&lt;/a&gt; idea of the restoration of Russia or its influence back to the borders of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire.\nOther observers described the concept as an instrument for projecting Russian &lt;a href=\"soft%20power\"&gt;soft power&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, the promotion of the Russian world has become strongly associated with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20Ukraine\"&gt;Russian military intervention in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. According to assistant editor Pavel Tikhomirov of , the Russian world for politicized Ukrainians, whose number constantly increases, nowadays is \"simply '&lt;a href=\"neo-Sovietism\"&gt;neo-Sovietism&lt;/a&gt;' masked by new names\". He reconciled that with the conflation of the Russian world and the Soviet Union within Russian society itself.\nPoliticization.\nRussia's president &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Arkaim\"&gt;Arkaim&lt;/a&gt; site of the Sintashta culture in 2005, meeting in person with the chief archaeologist &lt;a href=\"Gennady%20Zdanovich\"&gt;Gennady Zdanovich&lt;/a&gt;. The visit received much attention from Russian media. They presented Arkaim as the \"homeland of the majority of contemporary people in Asia, and, partly, Europe\". Nationalists called Arkaim the \"city of Russian glory\" and the \"most ancient Slavic-Aryan town\". Zdanovich reportedly presented Arkaim to the president as a possible \"national idea of Russia\", a new idea of civilisation which &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Schnirelmann\"&gt;Victor Schnirelmann&lt;/a&gt; calls the \"Russian idea\".\nRussian Orthodox Church and Russian world.\nAt the end of the 9th century AD, pre-Christian Russia adopted &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Byzantium\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt; in its Greco-Oriental form. On 3 November 2009, at the Third Russian World Assembly, &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Kirill%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch Kirill of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; defined the Russian world as \"the common civilisational space founded on three pillars: &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20culture\"&gt;Russian culture&lt;/a&gt; and especially the language and the common historical memory and connected with its common vision on the further social development\".\n\"Russkiy Mir\" is an ideology promoted by many in the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. \"This ideology, concocted as a reaction to the loss of Russian control over &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;fall of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to assert a spiritual and cultural unity of the peoples descended from the &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;Kievan Rus&lt;/a&gt;, presumably under Russian leadership.\" &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Kirill%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch Kiril of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; also shares this ideology; for the Russian Orthodox Church, the \"Russkiy Mir\" is also \"a spiritual concept, a reminder that through the &lt;a href=\"Christianization%20of%20Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;baptism of \"Rus\"&lt;/a&gt;\",\" God consecrated these people to the task of building a \"&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Rus\"&gt;Holy Rus&lt;/a&gt;\".\"\nOn 31 January 2019, &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Kirill%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch Kirill of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; declared concerning the religious relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;: \"Ukraine is not on the periphery of our church. We call &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt; 'the mother of all Russian cities.' For us Kiev is what &lt;a href=\"Religious%20significance%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem is for many&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodoxy\"&gt;Russian Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Christianization%20of%20Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;began there&lt;/a&gt;, so under no circumstances can we abandon this historical and spiritual relationship. The whole unity of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;our Local Church&lt;/a&gt; is based on these spiritual ties.\""
