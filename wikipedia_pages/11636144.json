    "text": "Sir Howard Douglas Hall, commonly referred to as \"The Old Arts Building\", is the oldest university building still in use in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, completed in 1827. The building is named after &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Douglas\"&gt;Howard Douglas&lt;/a&gt; and is located on the &lt;a href=\"Fredericton\"&gt;Fredericton&lt;/a&gt; campus of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;University of New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. The lobby of the building resembles a small museum due to the historic documents and other artifacts stored there. The &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Jacob%20%28clergyman%29\"&gt;Edwin Jacob&lt;/a&gt; chapel is also located in the lobby. The 'Great Hallways' of this building are filled with history as they are lined with portraits of past presidents of the university.\nThe building was designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada\"&gt;National Historic Site of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 1951.\nAffiliations.\nThe Museum is affiliated with: &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Museums%20Association\"&gt;CMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Heritage%20Information%20Network\"&gt;CHIN&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Museum%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Virtual Museum of Canada&lt;/a&gt;."
