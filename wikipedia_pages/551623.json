    "text": "William John Bowser (&lt;a href=\"Rexton%2C%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;Rexton, New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; December 3, 1867 \u2013 October 25, 1933 &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;) was a politician in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He served as the 17th &lt;a href=\"premier%20of%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;premier of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; from 1915 to 1916.\nThe son of William Bowser and Margaret Gordon, Bowser was educated at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Allison%20University\"&gt;Mount Allison University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalhousie%20University\"&gt;Dalhousie University&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; to practice law in 1891, and was first elected to the provincial &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1903%20British%20Columbia%20general%20election\"&gt;1903 election&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia%20Conservative%20Party\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;. Bowser served as &lt;a href=\"Attorney-General\"&gt;Attorney-General&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; of Sir &lt;a href=\"Richard%20McBride\"&gt;Richard McBride&lt;/a&gt; from 1907 until 1915. As Attorney-General, Bowser forced the Squamish First Nation, then the False Creek Indian Band, off Kitsilano Indian Reserve no.6.\nIn 1915, he succeeded McBride as &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Conservative party was deeply divided and unpopular and the change in leadership did not improve matters. Accusations of corruption and \"&lt;a href=\"Political%20machine\"&gt;machine politics&lt;/a&gt;\" were rife. The Conservatives also neglected to address popular demands for &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20suffrage\"&gt;women's suffrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"prohibition\"&gt;prohibition&lt;/a&gt;. Bowser's government was defeated in the &lt;a href=\"1916%20British%20Columbia%20general%20election\"&gt;1916 election&lt;/a&gt;, losing to Liberal leader Harlan Carey Brewster, who two years later was succeeded by the more memorable &lt;a href=\"John%20Oliver%20%28British%20Columbia%20politician%29\"&gt;John Oliver&lt;/a&gt;. Bowser continued as &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28British%20Columbia%29\"&gt;leader of the opposition&lt;/a&gt; until he lost his seat in the &lt;a href=\"1924%20British%20Columbia%20general%20election\"&gt;1924 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe returned to politics in the &lt;a href=\"1933%20British%20Columbia%20general%20election\"&gt;1933 election&lt;/a&gt; to lead the &lt;a href=\"Non-Partisan%20Independent%20Group\"&gt;Non-Partisan Independent Group&lt;/a&gt; of candidates, but died during the election campaign.\nA river, a lake and the small community of &lt;a href=\"Bowser%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Bowser&lt;/a&gt; on Vancouver Island, between Parksville and the Comox Valley, are named for Bowser."
