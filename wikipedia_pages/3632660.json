    "text": "Ewart Bryon Butler (5 June 1934\u00a0\u2013 26 April 2001) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; writer and broadcaster, best known as the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; correspondent from 1968 to 1991.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Taunton\"&gt;Taunton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somerset\"&gt;Somerset&lt;/a&gt; and educated at &lt;a href=\"Taunton%20School\"&gt;Taunton School&lt;/a&gt;. After working for a number of regional &lt;a href=\"newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;s, he joined the \"&lt;a href=\"News%20Chronicle\"&gt;News Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" shortly before its closure in 1960, soon moving to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\". Around this time, he also started reporting football matches for the BBC, and in 1968 became a radio commentator and the corporation's football correspondent. He was well known for his crisp, eloquent, precise style, with a distinctive &lt;a href=\"West%20Country\"&gt;West Country&lt;/a&gt; undertone to his voice. Although he often did not actually commentate on the very big occasions, frequently taking a side role as summariser (in earlier years) or presenter or reporter (in later years), he commentated on a number of &lt;a href=\"Football%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals, as well as the famous quarter-final between &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. He frequently worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Edelston\"&gt;Maurice Edelston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Jones%20%28broadcaster%29\"&gt;Peter Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Parry\"&gt;Alan Parry&lt;/a&gt; and, latterly, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Green%20%28broadcaster%29\"&gt;Alan Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Ingham\"&gt;Mike Ingham&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe wrote or co-wrote a number of football books and also wrote for the \"Daily Telegraph\" on &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;. In 1991, he retired as the BBC's football correspondent to concentrate on his writing career. He also gave up commentary around this time.\nOn his death in 2001, he was widely mourned as a representative of a bygone era of sports broadcasting, arguably less brash and more eloquent than the present."
