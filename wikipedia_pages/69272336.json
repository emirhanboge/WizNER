It was founded by entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B9i%20Th%C3%A0nh%20Nh%C6%A1n\"&gt;B\u00f9i Th\u00e0nh Nh\u01a1n&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nNh\u01a1n established Th\u00e0nh Nh\u01a1n Trading Company Limited with a charter capital of 400 million VND. Initially, the company sold veterinary drugs, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. In 2007, it was restructured into two units - Anova Joint Stock Company and No Va Real Estate Investment Group Joint Stock Company (Novaland).\nOn December 28, 2016, Novaland was officially listed on Vietnam's stock market - with stock code \"NVL\" on Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). At this time, its market capitalization was VND29,500 billion (about $1.3 billion).\nNovaland was alleged to have a connection with (aka V\u0169 \u201cnh\u00f4m\u201d) \u2013 a Vietnamese businessman who was accused of having abused his authority and worked with various Vietnamese real estate developers to appropriate \u201ctons of money\u201d.\nAppropriation of resettlement land.\nIn 2007-2009, the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City ordered to take 30.1 hectares of resettlement land for people in Th\u1ee7 Thi\u00eam New Urban Area to exchange for 30.2 hectares of land in B\u00ecnh Kh\u00e1nh and B\u00ecnh Tr\u01b0ng T\u00e2y ward, District 2 - which 21st Century International Development Joint Stock Company (a subsidiary of Novaland) owned.\nThen, in July 2017, this 30.2-hectare area was again assigned to 21st Century International Development Joint Stock Company for a real estate project.\nIn September 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20Inspectorate\"&gt;Government Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt; issued a notice of inspection, which concluded that the People's Committee of the City had approved the use of this area for wrong purposes. After that, the People's Committee of the City again approved the use of this resettlement area for housing and business - without conducting an auction as regulated.\nControversies.\nIn November 2020, an article on ThuongTruong24h.vn reported that Novaland had not finished issuing house ownership certificates in 11 real estate projects.\nIn January 2021, Ho Chi Minh City Inspectorate was reported to have discovered many wrongdoings of the T\u00e2n An Huy Residential Area project's investors, including those related to Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Co. Ltd and Novaland Group."
