For his services, he received the title of Viscount of Santa Marta in 1823.\nIn 1824, he played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"April%20Revolt\"&gt;April Revolt&lt;/a&gt; and in 1828 at the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Wars\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Miguelist\"&gt;Miguelist&lt;/a&gt; camp.&lt;br&gt; \nIn 1832, he directed the Miguelist forces at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Porto\"&gt;Siege of Porto&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Xavier%20da%20Fonseca%20Coutinho%20e%20P%C3%B3voas\"&gt;General P\u00f3voas&lt;/a&gt;. Because of his prudent approach and rivalry with General P\u00f3voas, he was relieved of command in February 1833. He retreated from public life and died in 1844. \nHe was succeeded as Viscount of Santa Marta by his son Jos\u00e9 de Sousa Pereira de Sampaio Va\u00eda, who also fought at the Siege of Porto, and who died without children in 1847.\nSource.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dodouropress.pt/index.asp%3Fidedicao%3D66%26amp%3Bidseccao%3D571%26amp%3Bid%3D5404%26amp%3Baction%3Dnoticia\"&gt;Do Douro Press&lt;/a&gt;"
