    "title": "Prince Edward Island pound",
    "text": "The pound was the currency of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edward%20Island\"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt; until 1871. It was subdivided into 20 \"&lt;a href=\"shilling\"&gt;shilling&lt;/a&gt;s\", each of 12 \"&lt;a href=\"penny\"&gt;pence&lt;/a&gt;\". It was replaced by the \"&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edward%20Island%20dollar\"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1871. British &lt;a href=\"Coins%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling\"&gt;coins&lt;/a&gt; circulated, together with locally produced coins and paper money.\nCoins.\nThe only coins issued exclusively for Prince Edward Island were issued in 1813. There were two denominations, the 1 and 5 shilling. Both were produced by cutting a central plug from a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20dollar\"&gt;Spanish dollar&lt;/a&gt; (8 &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20real\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;) coin. The plug, stamped with a &lt;a href=\"sunburst\"&gt;sunburst&lt;/a&gt;, made the 1 shilling piece, whilst the similarly stamped ring made the 5 shilling piece. Due to its shape, the 5 shilling coin was known as a &lt;a href=\"holey%20dollar\"&gt;holey dollar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBanknotes.\nIn 1790, the Island of St. Jean (as Prince Edward Island was then known) issued Treasury notes in denominations of 1, 1\u00bd, 2\u00bd, 5, 10, 20 and 40 shillings. A further issue of Treasury notes was made between 1834 and 1870, with denominations of 5 and 10 shillings, 1, 2 and 5 pounds.\nAlong with the Treasury notes, two &lt;a href=\"Banking%20in%20Canada\"&gt;chartered banks&lt;/a&gt; issued paper money, the \"&lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Prince%20Edward%20Island\"&gt;Bank of Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;\" which\ncommenced operations Aug 13, 1854 and the \"&lt;a href=\"Union%20Bank%20of%20Prince%20Edward%20Island\"&gt;Union Bank of Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the pounds issued by these two banks had different values relative to sterling. The Bank of Prince Edward Island issued notes in denominations of 5 and 10 shillings, 1, 2 and 5 pounds between 1856 and 1863. These pounds were worth 13 shillings 4 pence sterling and the notes also carried the denomination in sterling (3s 4d, 6s 8d, 13s 4d, \u00a31 6s 8d and \u00a33 6s 8d). The Union Bank issued notes between 1864 and 1865 denominated in both dollars (worth 4 shillings 2 pence) and sterling. Denominations were 1, 2, 5 and 20 dollars (4s 2d, 8s 4d, \u00a31 10d, \u00a34 3s 4d sterling)."
