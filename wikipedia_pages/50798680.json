Acting as over-sexualized &lt;a href=\"shoulder%20angel\"&gt;shoulder angel&lt;/a&gt;s are the hormone monsters: Maurice (who pesters Andrew and Matthew and occasionally Nick), Connie\u2014the hormone monstress (who pesters Jessi and Nick and occasionally Missy) and Mona (who mainly pesters Missy). Throughout the series, the kids interact with people and objects who are often personified and offer helpful, yet confusing, advice in their puberty-filled lives including the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Ellington\"&gt;Duke Ellington&lt;/a&gt;, a French-accented &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pillow\"&gt;pillow&lt;/a&gt; capable of getting pregnant, a bar of &lt;a href=\"Adderall\"&gt;Adderall&lt;/a&gt;, and even Jessi's own &lt;a href=\"vulva\"&gt;vulva&lt;/a&gt;. They seek out their destiny as puberty destroys them mentally and physically.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nTV writer &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Goldberg%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Andrew Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; and screenwriter-directors &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Flackett\"&gt;Jennifer Flackett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Levin%20%28director%29\"&gt;Mark Levin&lt;/a&gt; approached &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Kroll\"&gt;Nick Kroll&lt;/a&gt;, Goldberg's best friend since childhood, with the idea to develop a show about going through puberty. Kroll and Goldberg used their divergent pubertal experiences as a centerpiece of the show, because Kroll was a late bloomer while Goldberg went through the physical changes of puberty very early. Many of their lived experiences are featured in the show, such as Kroll's first kiss, and Goldberg's parents waxing his mustache. The show also includes an experience of their childhood friend, Lizzie, who the character of Jessi is based on, getting her first period on a school trip to the Statue of Liberty. According to Kroll in an interview on &lt;a href=\"NPR\"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, \"Big Mouth\" \"takes an equal look at what it's like for girls and women, the process of going through puberty, which I think has not been quite as explored in most popular culture.\" Netflix announced they had picked up \"Big Mouth\" in June 2016. \nOn June 24, 2020, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Jenny%20Slate\"&gt;Jenny Slate&lt;/a&gt; decided to step down from voicing Missy Foreman-Greenwald so that a Black actress could have the role in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"George%20Floyd%20protests\"&gt;George Floyd protests&lt;/a&gt;. Slate's final time voicing Missy is in the fourth season as she recorded her lines in advance. On August 28, 2020, it was reported that &lt;a href=\"Ayo%20Edebiri\"&gt;Ayo Edebiri&lt;/a&gt; was cast to replace Slate as Missy.
