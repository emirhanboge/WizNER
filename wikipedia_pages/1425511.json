    "text": "The Schaumburg Flyers were a professional baseball team based in &lt;a href=\"Schaumburg%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Schaumburg, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Flyers were to be charter members of the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20League%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;North American League&lt;/a&gt;, which is not affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, but the team folded in March 2011, before beginning play in the NAL. From 1999 to 2010, the Flyers played their home games at &lt;a href=\"Boomers%20Stadium\"&gt;Alexian Field&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20O%27Hare%20Expressway\"&gt;Elgin O'Hare Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. They formerly played in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bay\"&gt;Thunder Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, where they were known as the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bay%20Whiskey%20Jacks\"&gt;Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks&lt;/a&gt;. The team belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20League%20%28baseball%2C%201993%E2%80%932010%29\"&gt;Northern League&lt;/a&gt; from 1993 to 2010.\nOn July 27, 2009, the Flyers played host to Battle of the Sexes II, which pitted the Flyers against the National Pro Fastpitch Softball Champions, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bandits\"&gt;Chicago Bandits&lt;/a&gt;, featuring star pitcher &lt;a href=\"Jennie%20Finch\"&gt;Jennie Finch&lt;/a&gt;. Played by official softball rules, the game was seen by an overflow record crowd of 8,918, and was won by the Bandits 4\u20132. \nIn 1999, the Flyers hired their first manager, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Kittle\"&gt;Ron Kittle&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his playing days with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;. The former &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; and White Sox player &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Hibbard\"&gt;Greg Hibbard&lt;/a&gt; was the pitching coach. Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team, using the gimmick \"Ma Kittle,\" portraying both himself and his \"Ma.\" The ads sparked interest as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kane%20County%20Cougars\"&gt;Kane County Cougars&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign mimicked the highly successful &lt;a href=\"Converse%20%28company%29\"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt; ads in which basketball star &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Johnson%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201969%29\"&gt;Larry Johnson&lt;/a&gt; starred as both himself and \"Gramama.\" After the 2001 season, however, Kittle resigned as manager, with Jim Boynewicz hired to replace him.\nIn 2004, the Flyers made it to the Northern League Championship Series against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%20Saints\"&gt;St. Paul Saints&lt;/a&gt;. Despite leading the five-game series 2\u20131, Schaumburg eventually lost the championship. In Game 5, Flyers relief &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; Lyle Prempas allowed a game-winning &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; by St. Paul infielder Marc Mirizzi in the ninth inning.\nThe Flyers appeared in the Northern League Playoffs four times (1999, 2003, 2004, 2006) but never won the championship. Among those who played for the Flyers were former &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20A%27s\"&gt;Oakland A's&lt;/a&gt; outfielder &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Canseco\"&gt;Ozzie Canseco&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; outfielders &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20Smith%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Dwight Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brant%20Brown\"&gt;Brant Brown&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, very briefly, &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Williams%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;John Henry Williams&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Williams\"&gt;Ted Williams&lt;/a&gt;.\nYear-by-year record.\n2006 and 2007 seasons.\nFor the second half of the 2006 season, the Flyers and MSN partnered to let fans choose the Flyers lineups online. This program is called \"Fan Club: Reality Baseball\". The program also included online video segments that took fans through the season alongside the team with behind-the-scenes access. The 2007 season saw the Flyers undergo some changes, most notably with the departure of '06 manager Andy McCauley to the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20T-Bones\"&gt;Kansas City T-Bones&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Maddock became the fourth manager in Flyers history after McCauley left for Kansas City, and he quickly worked to build a team that had only one member carry over from the 2006 campaign. The road for Schaumburg that year proved to be difficult, as the Flyers could manage no more than 20 wins in either half of the season and failed to make the playoffs.\n2008 season.\nThe Flyers struggled mightily through the 2008 season, dropping their final 14 contests and winning just 30 games. Manager Steve Maddock will not return for the following season, and only six players will don Flyers uniforms on Opening Day 2009.

Diaz connected for his 24th homer of the season, and his 75th RBI to help the Goldeyes take the lead 2\u20131. The lead would not last long, as the Flyers would answer in the bottom half of the inning. Ruddy Yan got on base with a single and Joey Gomes would drive him in to tie the game 2\u20132 after six. \nOnce more in the game, back-to-back scoring frames would occur starting with Winnipeg in the top of the 8th inning. Justice would have the game winning 2-RBI single to make the score 4\u20132, leaving the Flyers left to answer in the bottom half of the inning.

Chad Benefield would be credited with his first career win as a professional pitcher, throwing 1.2 innings in relief of Goldeyes starter Jason Mackintosh. \nSeptember 15, 2010: Travis Brown is named the Northern League's Top Defensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. Brown led all shortstops with 330 assists and 522 total chances, committing only 20 errors (.962), and helping the Flyers post the best fielding percentage in the league (.977). \nNovember 18, 2010: Flyers join newly formed North American Baseball League. The league was formed by members of the Golden Baseball League, the Northern League, and the United League.\nLatter years and disbandment.\nToward the end of the 2010 season, in late August, Rich Ehrenreich's operating company for the team, Schaumburg Professional Baseball, L.L.C., was stripped of its business registration for nonpayment of sales and withholding taxes. Heavily in debt, Ehrenreich was attempting to sell the team since the beginning of the 2010 season to concentrate on the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%20Fielders\"&gt;Lake County Fielders&lt;/a&gt; (which Ehrenrich co-owns under a separate operating company), and a proposed sale in June 2010 to Adriano Pedrelli had fallen through.\nDespite troubles with Illinois tax officials, the Flyers signaled their intent to join the newly formed &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20League%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;North American League&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 2010, intending to play the 2011 season in that league. However, the Schaumburg Flyers were served an eviction notice from Alexian Field on February 24, with the team over $900,000 in arrears in rent on Alexian Field going back to 2007. A &lt;a href=\"Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Cook County&lt;/a&gt; judge terminated the lease and ordering Flyers' ownership to pay the village and the Schaumburg Park District (the co-landlords) $551,828.92 in back rent (although the actual amount owed was $920,000 going back to 2007), with the eviction becoming final on March 6, 2011. Three days after the eviction notice became final, the owner of the &lt;a href=\"Joliet%20Slammers\"&gt;Joliet Slammers&lt;/a&gt;, Alan Oremus, was awarded a new lease on the stadium. A new lease was signed by the new operating company, E.J.I., LLC, in July 2011, after which Oremus sold the franchise to local attorney &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20A.%20Salvi\"&gt;Patrick A. Salvi&lt;/a&gt;. The replacement team, the &lt;a href=\"Schaumburg%20Boomers\"&gt;Schaumburg Boomers&lt;/a&gt;, began play in 2012.\nThe assets of the Flyers were auctioned in April 2011, bringing an end to the franchise. The back rent, however, has not been collected by Schaumburg officials."
