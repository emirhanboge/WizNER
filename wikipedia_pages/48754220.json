The match is normally held in late September and has received coverage from &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Sports\"&gt;Sky Sports&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and IRB\u2019s Total Rugby.\nMen's Results.\nVarsity matches were initially held on &lt;a href=\"St.%20Andrew%27s%20Day\"&gt;St. Andrew's Day&lt;/a&gt; but have been moved earlier to late September, they have attracted notable attendees including her &lt;a href=\"Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal\"&gt;Royal Highness Princess Anne&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nWomen's Results.\nIn 2014, the inaugural Women's Varsity Match took place in the form of a 7-a-side match.
