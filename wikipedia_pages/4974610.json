    "text": "Chi Draconis (\u03c7 Dra, \u03c7 Draconis, Chi Draconis) is a &lt;a href=\"star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; system in the &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Draco%20%28constellation%29\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe first companion is a yellow-white (class F) fourth-magnitude star with a mass approximately equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, but it is nearly twice as luminous. The second companion is an orange (class K) sixth-magnitude star, that is less massive and of lesser &lt;a href=\"luminosity\"&gt;luminosity&lt;/a&gt; than the sun. In 1898 this system was reported to be a &lt;a href=\"spectroscopic%20binary\"&gt;spectroscopic binary&lt;/a&gt; system, with an orbital period of 280.55 days. The two stars have an average separation of nearly an &lt;a href=\"astronomical%20unit\"&gt;astronomical unit&lt;/a&gt;, which would disrupt the orbit of any Earth-like planet that was close enough to the primary to support liquid water. The two stars have less than half the abundance of heavy elements as the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and are approximately a billion years older. Separations between the two stars have been measured and the difference in brightness between the two stars is 2.12 magnitudes at 700 &lt;a href=\"Nanometre\"&gt;nm&lt;/a&gt;. "
