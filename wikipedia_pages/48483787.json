    "text": "The Hellenic Federation of Rugby League, or simply Hellas Rugby League, was the &lt;a href=\"Sport%20governing%20body\"&gt;governing body&lt;/a&gt; for the sport of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; between 2013 and 2016. The association was founded in 2013 by Anastasios \"Tasos\" Pantazidis.\nThe body was accorded observer status within the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20European%20Federation\"&gt;Rugby League European Federation&lt;/a&gt; (RLEF) in August 2013, and affiliate status in February 2014.\nIn April 2016, the HFRL was suspended from the RLEF following a year-long investigation for \"wilfully acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the RLEF and international rugby league.\" The HRFL was expelled from the RLEF in August 2016 for failing to meet membership requirements.\nThe HFRL continues to operate in Greece, and gained recognition by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Culture%20and%20Sports%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Ministry of Culture and Sports&lt;/a&gt; in July 2017 as part of the Hellenic Federation of Modern Pentathlon. The HFMoP, together with LIRFL, PRL and other organisations, founded the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;World Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; to run their own rugby league organisation on an international scale.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Rugby%20League%20Association\"&gt;Greek Rugby League Association&lt;/a&gt; has been recognised by the RLEF as the governing body of rugby league in Greece since March 2017. The conflict between the HFRL/HFMP and the RLIF continues as of August 2019."
