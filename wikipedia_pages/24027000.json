    "text": "Water () is a &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20polarity\"&gt;polar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"inorganic%20compound\"&gt;inorganic compound&lt;/a&gt; that is at &lt;a href=\"room%20temperature\"&gt;room temperature&lt;/a&gt; a tasteless and odorless &lt;a href=\"liquid\"&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly colorless apart from &lt;a href=\"Color%20of%20water\"&gt;an inherent hint of blue&lt;/a&gt;. It is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the \"universal &lt;a href=\"solvent\"&gt;solvent&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"solvent of life.\" It is the most abundant substance on the surface of &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; and the only common substance to exist as a &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;solid&lt;/a&gt;, liquid, and &lt;a href=\"water%20vapor\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt; on Earth's surface. It is also the third most abundant molecule in the universe (behind &lt;a href=\"Hydrogen\"&gt;molecular hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20monoxide\"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;).\nWater molecules form &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bonds\"&gt;hydrogen bonds&lt;/a&gt; with each other and are strongly polar. This polarity allows it to dissociate &lt;a href=\"ions\"&gt;ions&lt;/a&gt; in salts and bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids, thus dissolving them. Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively high &lt;a href=\"boiling%20point\"&gt;boiling point&lt;/a&gt; of 100\u00a0\u00b0C for its &lt;a href=\"molar%20mass\"&gt;molar mass&lt;/a&gt;, and a high &lt;a href=\"heat%20capacity\"&gt;heat capacity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater is &lt;a href=\"amphoteric\"&gt;amphoteric&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it can exhibit properties of an &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"base%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the pH of the solution that it is in; it readily produces both &lt;a href=\"hydron%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hydroxide\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ions. Related to its amphoteric character, it undergoes &lt;a href=\"self-ionization%20of%20water\"&gt;self-ionization&lt;/a&gt;. The product of the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20activity\"&gt;activities&lt;/a&gt;, or approximately, the concentrations of and is a constant, so their respective concentrations are inversely proportional to each other.\nPhysical properties.\nWater is the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20substance\"&gt;chemical substance&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"chemical%20formula\"&gt;chemical formula&lt;/a&gt; ; one &lt;a href=\"molecule\"&gt;molecule&lt;/a&gt; of water has two &lt;a href=\"hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"atom\"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"covalent\"&gt;covalent&lt;/a&gt;ly &lt;a href=\"chemical%20bond\"&gt;bonded&lt;/a&gt; to a single &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; atom.\nWater is a tasteless, odorless liquid at &lt;a href=\"standard%20conditions\"&gt;ambient temperature and pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Liquid water has weak &lt;a href=\"absorption%20band\"&gt;absorption band&lt;/a&gt;s at wavelengths of around 750\u00a0nm which cause it to appear to have a blue colour. This can easily be observed in a water-filled bath or wash-basin whose lining is white. Large ice crystals, as in &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s, also appear blue.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure\"&gt;standard conditions&lt;/a&gt;, water is primarily a liquid, unlike other analogous hydrides of the &lt;a href=\"Chalcogen\"&gt;oxygen family&lt;/a&gt;, which are generally gaseous. This unique property of water is due to &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bonding\"&gt;hydrogen bonding&lt;/a&gt;. The molecules of water are constantly moving concerning each other, and the hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and reforming at timescales faster than 200 femtoseconds (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 seconds).\nHowever, these bonds are strong enough to create many of the peculiar properties of water, some of which make it integral to life.\nWater, ice, and vapour.\nWithin the Earth's atmosphere and surface, the &lt;a href=\"liquid%20phase\"&gt;liquid phase&lt;/a&gt; is the most common and is the form that is generally denoted by the word \"water\". The &lt;a href=\"solid\"&gt;solid phase&lt;/a&gt; of water is known as &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; and commonly takes the structure of hard, amalgamated &lt;a href=\"crystals\"&gt;crystals&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"ice%20cubes\"&gt;ice cubes&lt;/a&gt;, or loosely accumulated &lt;a href=\"granular%20material\"&gt;granular&lt;/a&gt; crystals, like &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Ih\"&gt;common hexagonal crystalline ice&lt;/a&gt;, other crystalline and amorphous &lt;a href=\"Ice%23Phases\"&gt;phases of ice&lt;/a&gt; are known. The &lt;a href=\"gaseous%20phase\"&gt;gaseous phase&lt;/a&gt; of water is known as &lt;a href=\"water%20vapor\"&gt;water vapor&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt;). Visible steam and clouds are formed from minute droplets of water suspended in the air.\nWater also forms a &lt;a href=\"supercritical%20fluid\"&gt;supercritical fluid&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"critical%20temperature\"&gt;critical temperature&lt;/a&gt; is 647 &lt;a href=\"kelvin\"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"critical%20pressure\"&gt;critical pressure&lt;/a&gt; is 22.064 &lt;a href=\"pascal%20%28unit%29\"&gt;MPa&lt;/a&gt;. In nature this only rarely occurs in extremely hostile conditions. A likely example of naturally occurring supercritical water is in the hottest parts of deep water &lt;a href=\"hydrothermal%20vents\"&gt;hydrothermal vents&lt;/a&gt;, in which water is heated to the critical temperature by &lt;a href=\"submarine%20volcano\"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plume%20%28hydrodynamics%29\"&gt;plumes&lt;/a&gt; and the critical pressure is caused by the weight of the ocean at the extreme depths where the vents are located. This pressure is reached at a depth of about 2200 meters: much less than the mean depth of the ocean (3800 meters).\nHeat capacity and heats of vaporization and fusion.\nWater has a very high &lt;a href=\"specific%20heat%20capacity\"&gt;specific heat capacity&lt;/a&gt; of 4184\u00a0J/(kg\u00b7K) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 the second-highest among all the heteroatomic species (after &lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a high &lt;a href=\"heat%20of%20vaporization\"&gt;heat of vaporization&lt;/a&gt; (40.65\u00a0kJ/mol or 2257\u00a0kJ/kg at the normal boiling point), both of which are a result of the extensive &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bond\"&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/a&gt;ing between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth's &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; by buffering large fluctuations in temperature. Most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has accumulated in the oceans.\nThe specific &lt;a href=\"enthalpy%20of%20fusion\"&gt;enthalpy of fusion&lt;/a&gt; (more commonly known as latent heat) of water is 333.55\u00a0kJ/kg at 0\u00a0\u00b0C: the same amount of energy is required to melt ice as to warm ice from \u2212160\u00a0\u00b0C up to its melting point or to heat the same amount of water by about 80\u00a0\u00b0C. Of common substances, only that of ammonia is higher. This property confers resistance to melting on the ice of &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"drift%20ice\"&gt;drift ice&lt;/a&gt;. Before and since the advent of mechanical &lt;a href=\"refrigeration\"&gt;refrigeration&lt;/a&gt;, ice was and still is in common use for retarding food spoilage.\nThe specific heat capacity of ice at \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C is 2030\u00a0J/(kg\u00b7K)\nand the heat capacity of steam at 100\u00a0\u00b0C is 2080\u00a0J/(kg\u00b7K).\nDensity of water and ice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"density\"&gt;density&lt;/a&gt; of water is about : this relationship was originally used to define the gram. The density varies with temperature, but not linearly: as the temperature increases, the density rises to a peak at and then decreases; this is unusual. Regular, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Ih\"&gt;hexagonal ice&lt;/a&gt; is also less dense than liquid water\u2014upon freezing, the density of water decreases by about 9%.\nThese effects are due to the reduction of thermal motion with cooling, which allows water molecules to form more hydrogen bonds that prevent the molecules from coming close to each other. In the range 0-4\u00a0\u00b0C the breakage of hydrogen bonds due to heating allows water molecules to pack closer despite the increase in the thermal motion (which tends to expand a liquid), above 4\u00a0\u00b0C water expands as the temperature increases. Water near the boiling point is about 4% less dense than water at .\nUnder increasing pressure, ice undergoes a number of transitions to other &lt;a href=\"polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29\"&gt;polymorphs&lt;/a&gt; with higher density than liquid water, such as &lt;a href=\"ice%20II\"&gt;ice II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice%20III\"&gt;ice III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high-density%20amorphous%20ice\"&gt;high-density amorphous ice&lt;/a&gt; (HDA), and &lt;a href=\"very-high-density%20amorphous%20ice\"&gt;very-high-density amorphous ice&lt;/a&gt; (VHDA).\nThe unusual density curve and lower density of ice than of water is essential for much of the life on earth\u2014if water were most dense at the freezing point, then in winter the very cold water at the surface of lakes and other water bodies would sink, lakes could freeze from the bottom up, and all life in them would be killed. Furthermore, given that water is a good thermal insulator (due to its\u00a0heat capacity), some frozen lakes might not completely thaw in summer. The layer of ice that floats on top insulates the water below. Water at about 4\u00a0\u00b0C (39\u00a0\u00b0F) also sinks to the bottom, thus keeping the temperature of the water at the bottom constant (see diagram).\nDensity of saltwater and ice.\nThe density of saltwater depends on the dissolved salt content as well as the temperature. Ice still floats in the oceans, otherwise, they would freeze from the bottom up. However, the salt content of oceans lowers the freezing point by about 1.9\u00a0\u00b0C (see &lt;a href=\"Freezing-point%20depression%23Freezing-point%20depression%20of%20a%20solvent%20and%20a%20solute\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for explanation) and lowers the temperature of the density maximum of water to the former freezing point at 0\u00a0\u00b0C. This is why, in ocean water, the downward convection of colder water is \"not\" blocked by an expansion of water as it becomes colder near the freezing point. The oceans' cold water near the freezing point continues to sink. So creatures that live at the bottom of cold oceans like the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; generally live in water 4\u00a0\u00b0C colder than at the bottom of frozen-over &lt;a href=\"fresh%20water\"&gt;fresh water&lt;/a&gt; lakes and rivers.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"surface%20science\"&gt;surface&lt;/a&gt; of saltwater begins to freeze (at \u22121.9\u00a0\u00b0C for normal salinity &lt;a href=\"seawater\"&gt;seawater&lt;/a&gt;, 3.5%) the ice that forms is essentially salt-free, with about the same density as freshwater ice. This ice floats on the surface, and the salt that is \"frozen out\" adds to the &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt; and density of the seawater just below it, in a process known as \"&lt;a href=\"brine%20rejection\"&gt;brine rejection&lt;/a&gt;\". This denser saltwater sinks by convection and the replacing seawater is subject to the same process. This produces essentially freshwater ice at \u22121.9\u00a0\u00b0C on the surface. The increased density of the seawater beneath the forming ice causes it to sink towards the bottom. On a large scale, the process of brine rejection and sinking cold salty water results in ocean currents forming to transport such water away from the Poles, leading to a global system of currents called the &lt;a href=\"thermohaline%20circulation\"&gt;thermohaline circulation&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiscibility and condensation.\nWater is &lt;a href=\"miscible\"&gt;miscible&lt;/a&gt; with many liquids, including &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; in all proportions. Water and most &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;s are immiscible usually forming layers according to increasing density from the top. This can be predicted by comparing the &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20polarity\"&gt;polarity&lt;/a&gt;. Water being a relatively polar compound will tend to be miscible with liquids of high polarity such as ethanol and acetone, whereas compounds with low polarity will tend to be immiscible and poorly &lt;a href=\"soluble\"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt; such as with &lt;a href=\"hydrocarbons\"&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a gas, water vapor is completely miscible with air. On the other hand, the maximum water &lt;a href=\"vapor%20pressure\"&gt;vapor pressure&lt;/a&gt; that is thermodynamically stable with the liquid (or solid) at a given temperature is relatively low compared with total atmospheric pressure.\nFor example, if the vapor's &lt;a href=\"partial%20pressure\"&gt;partial pressure&lt;/a&gt; is 2% of atmospheric pressure and the air is cooled from 25\u00a0\u00b0C, starting at about 22\u00a0\u00b0C water will start to condense, defining the &lt;a href=\"dew%20point\"&gt;dew point&lt;/a&gt;, and creating &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dew\"&gt;dew&lt;/a&gt;. The reverse process accounts for the fog burning off in the morning. If the humidity is increased at room temperature, for example, by running a hot shower or a bath, and the temperature stays about the same, the vapor soon reaches the pressure for phase change and then condenses out as minute water droplets, commonly referred to as steam.\nA saturated gas or one with 100% relative humidity is when the vapor pressure of water in the air is at equilibrium with vapor pressure due to (liquid) water; water (or ice, if cool enough) will fail to lose mass through evaporation when exposed to saturated air. Because the amount of water vapor in the air is small, relative humidity, the ratio of the partial pressure due to the water vapor to the saturated partial vapor pressure, is much more useful.\nVapor pressure above 100% relative humidity is called super-saturated and can occur if the air is rapidly cooled, for example, by rising suddenly in an updraft.\nCompressibility.\nThe &lt;a href=\"compressibility\"&gt;compressibility&lt;/a&gt; of water is a function of pressure and temperature. At 0\u00a0\u00b0C, at the limit of zero pressure, the compressibility is . At the zero-pressure limit, the compressibility reaches a minimum of around 45\u00a0\u00b0C before increasing again with increasing temperature. As the pressure is increased, the compressibility decreases, being at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and .\nThe &lt;a href=\"bulk%20modulus\"&gt;bulk modulus&lt;/a&gt; of water is about 2.2\u00a0GPa. The low compressibility of non-gases, and of water in particular, leads to their often being assumed as incompressible. The low compressibility of water means that even in the deep &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s at 4\u00a0km depth, where pressures are 40\u00a0MPa, there is only a 1.8% decrease in volume.\nThe bulk modulus of water ice ranges from 11.3\u00a0GPa at 0\u00a0K up to 8.6\u00a0GPa at 273\u00a0K. The large change in the compressibility of ice as a function of temperature is the result of its relatively large thermal expansion coefficient compared to other common solids.\nTriple point.\n The &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pressure\"&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt; at which ordinary solid, liquid, and gaseous water coexist in equilibrium is a &lt;a href=\"triple%20point\"&gt;triple point&lt;/a&gt; of water. Since 1954, this point had been used to define the base unit of temperature, the &lt;a href=\"kelvin\"&gt;kelvin&lt;/a&gt; but, &lt;a href=\"2019%20redefinition%20of%20SI%20base%20units\"&gt;starting in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the kelvin is now defined using the &lt;a href=\"Boltzmann%20constant\"&gt;Boltzmann constant&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the triple point of water.\nDue to the existence of many &lt;a href=\"Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29\"&gt;polymorphs&lt;/a&gt; (forms) of ice, water has other triple points, which have either three polymorphs of ice or two polymorphs of ice and liquid in equilibrium. &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Heinrich%20Johann%20Apollon%20Tammann\"&gt;Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann&lt;/a&gt; in G\u00f6ttingen produced data on several other triple points in the early 20th century. Kamb and others documented further triple points in the 1960s.\nMelting point.\nThe melting point of ice is at standard pressure; however, pure liquid water can be &lt;a href=\"supercooled\"&gt;supercooled&lt;/a&gt; well below that temperature without freezing if the liquid is not mechanically disturbed. It can remain in a fluid state down to its homogeneous &lt;a href=\"nucleation\"&gt;nucleation&lt;/a&gt; point of about . The melting point of ordinary hexagonal ice falls slightly under moderately high pressures, by /atm or about /70 atm as the stabilization energy of hydrogen bonding is exceeded by intermolecular repulsion, but as ice transforms into its polymorphs (see &lt;a href=\"Ice%23Phases\"&gt;crystalline states of ice&lt;/a&gt;) above , the melting point increases markedly &lt;a href=\"Ice%23At%20different%20pressures\"&gt;with pressure&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., reaching at (triple point of &lt;a href=\"Ice%20VII\"&gt;Ice VII&lt;/a&gt;).\nElectrical properties.\nElectrical conductivity.\nPure water containing no exogenous &lt;a href=\"ion\"&gt;ion&lt;/a&gt;s is an excellent electronic &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20insulation\"&gt;insulator&lt;/a&gt;, but not even \"deionized\" water is completely free of ions. Water undergoes &lt;a href=\"self-ionization%20of%20water\"&gt;auto-ionization&lt;/a&gt; in the liquid state when two water molecules form one hydroxide anion () and one hydronium cation (). Because of auto-ionization, at ambient temperatures pure liquid water has a similar intrinsic charge carrier concentration to the semiconductor germanium and an intrinsic charge carrier concentration\u00a0 three orders of magnitude greater than the semiconductor silicon, hence, based on charge carrier concentration, water can not be considered to be a completely dielectric material or electrical insulator but to be a limited conductor of ionic charge.\nBecause water is such a good solvent, it almost always has some &lt;a href=\"solute\"&gt;solute&lt;/a&gt; dissolved in it, often a &lt;a href=\"Salt%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;. If water has even a tiny amount of such an impurity, then the ions can carry charges back and forth, allowing the water to conduct electricity far more readily.\nIt is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 18.2 M\u03a9\u00b7cm (182 &lt;a href=\"kilohm\"&gt;k\u03a9&lt;/a&gt;\u00b7m) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on &lt;a href=\"reverse%20osmosis\"&gt;reverse osmosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ultrafiltration\"&gt;ultra-filtered&lt;/a&gt; and deionized ultra-pure water systems used, for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in otherwise ultra-pure water begins to noticeably lower its resistivity by up to several k\u03a9\u00b7m.\nIn pure water, sensitive equipment can detect a very slight &lt;a href=\"electrical%20conductivity\"&gt;electrical conductivity&lt;/a&gt; of 0.05501 \u00b1 0.0001 &lt;a href=\"Siemens%20%28unit%29\"&gt;\u03bcS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Centimeter\"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; at 25.00\u00a0\u00b0C. Water can also be &lt;a href=\"electrolysis\"&gt;electrolyzed&lt;/a&gt; into oxygen and hydrogen gases but in the absence of dissolved ions this is a very slow process, as very little current is conducted. In ice, the primary charge carriers are &lt;a href=\"protons\"&gt;protons&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"proton%20conductor\"&gt;proton conductor&lt;/a&gt;). Ice was previously thought to have a small but measurable conductivity of 1\u00a0S/cm, but this conductivity is now thought to be almost entirely from surface defects, and without those, ice is an insulator with an immeasurably small conductivity.\nPolarity and hydrogen bonding.\nAn important feature of water is its polar nature. The structure has a &lt;a href=\"bent%20molecular%20geometry\"&gt;bent molecular geometry&lt;/a&gt; for the two hydrogens from the oxygen vertex. The oxygen atom also has two &lt;a href=\"lone%20pairs\"&gt;lone pairs&lt;/a&gt; of electrons. One effect usually ascribed to the lone pairs is that the H\u2013O\u2013H gas-phase bend angle is 104.48\u00b0, which is smaller than the typical &lt;a href=\"tetrahedral%20molecular%20geometry\"&gt;tetrahedral&lt;/a&gt; angle of 109.47\u00b0. The lone pairs are closer to the oxygen atom than the electrons &lt;a href=\"sigma%20bond\"&gt;sigma bond&lt;/a&gt;ed to the hydrogens, so they require more space. The increased repulsion of the lone pairs forces the O\u2013H bonds closer to each other. \nAnother consequence of its &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; is that water is a &lt;a href=\"polar%20molecule\"&gt;polar molecule&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the difference in &lt;a href=\"electronegativity\"&gt;electronegativity&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"bond%20dipole%20moment\"&gt;bond dipole moment&lt;/a&gt; points from each H to the O, making the oxygen partially negative and each hydrogen partially positive. A large molecular &lt;a href=\"Electric%20dipole%20moment\"&gt;dipole&lt;/a&gt;, points from a region between the two hydrogen atoms to the oxygen atom. The charge differences cause water molecules to aggregate (the relatively positive areas being attracted to the relatively negative areas). This attraction, &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bond\"&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/a&gt;ing, explains many of the properties of water, such as its solvent properties.\nAlthough hydrogen bonding is a relatively weak attraction compared to the covalent bonds within the water molecule itself, it is responsible for several of the water's physical properties. These properties include its relatively high &lt;a href=\"melting%20point\"&gt;melting&lt;/a&gt; and boiling point temperatures: more energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. In contrast, hydrogen sulfide (), has much weaker hydrogen bonding due to sulfur's lower electronegativity. is a gas at &lt;a href=\"room%20temperature\"&gt;room temperature&lt;/a&gt;, despite hydrogen sulfide having nearly twice the molar mass of water. The extra bonding between water molecules also gives liquid water a large &lt;a href=\"specific%20heat%20capacity\"&gt;specific heat capacity&lt;/a&gt;. This high heat capacity makes water a good heat storage medium (coolant) and heat shield.\nCohesion and adhesion.\nWater molecules stay close to each other (&lt;a href=\"cohesion%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;cohesion&lt;/a&gt;), due to the collective action of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking, with new bonds being formed with different water molecules; but at any given time in a sample of liquid water, a large portion of the molecules are held together by such bonds.\nWater also has high &lt;a href=\"adhesion\"&gt;adhesion&lt;/a&gt; properties because of its polar nature. On clean, smooth &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; the water may form a thin film because the molecular forces between glass and water molecules (adhesive forces) are stronger than the cohesive forces.\nIn biological cells and &lt;a href=\"organelle\"&gt;organelle&lt;/a&gt;s, water is in contact with membrane and protein surfaces that are &lt;a href=\"hydrophilic\"&gt;hydrophilic&lt;/a&gt;; that is, surfaces that have a strong attraction to water. &lt;a href=\"Irving%20Langmuir\"&gt;Irving Langmuir&lt;/a&gt; observed a strong repulsive force between hydrophilic surfaces. To dehydrate hydrophilic surfaces\u2014to remove the strongly held layers of water of hydration\u2014requires doing substantial work against these forces, called hydration forces. These forces are very large but decrease rapidly over a nanometer or less. They are important in biology, particularly when cells are dehydrated by exposure to dry atmospheres or to extracellular freezing.\nSurface tension.\nWater has an unusually high &lt;a href=\"surface%20tension\"&gt;surface tension&lt;/a&gt; of 71.99\u00a0mN/m at 25\u00a0\u00b0C which is caused by the strength of the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. This allows insects to walk on water.\nCapillary action.\nBecause water has strong cohesive and adhesive forces, it exhibits capillary action. Strong cohesion from hydrogen bonding and adhesion allows trees to transport water more than 100 m upward.\nWater as a solvent.\nWater is an excellent &lt;a href=\"solvent\"&gt;solvent&lt;/a&gt; due to its high dielectric constant. Substances that mix well and dissolve in water are known as &lt;a href=\"hydrophilic\"&gt;hydrophilic&lt;/a&gt; (\"water-loving\") substances, while those that do not mix well with water are known as &lt;a href=\"hydrophobic\"&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/a&gt; (\"water-fearing\") substances. The ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether or not the substance can match or better the strong &lt;a href=\"Dipole-dipole%20interaction\"&gt;attractive forces&lt;/a&gt; that water molecules generate between other water molecules. If a substance has properties that do not allow it to overcome these strong intermolecular forces, the molecules are &lt;a href=\"precipitation%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;precipitated out&lt;/a&gt; from the water. Contrary to the common misconception, water and hydrophobic substances do not \"repel\", and the hydration of a hydrophobic surface is energetically, but not entropically, favorable.\nWhen an ionic or polar compound enters water, it is surrounded by water molecules (&lt;a href=\"Solvation\"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;). The relatively small size of water molecules (~ 3 angstroms) allows many water molecules to surround one molecule of &lt;a href=\"solute\"&gt;solute&lt;/a&gt;. The partially negative dipole ends of the water are attracted to positively charged components of the solute, and vice versa for the positive dipole ends.\nIn general, ionic and polar substances such as &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"salt%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;s are relatively soluble in water, and non-polar substances such as fats and oils are not. Non-polar molecules stay together in water because it is energetically more favorable for the water molecules to hydrogen bond to each other than to engage in &lt;a href=\"van%20der%20Waals%20force\"&gt;van der Waals interactions&lt;/a&gt; with non-polar molecules.\nAn example of an ionic solute is &lt;a href=\"sodium%20chloride\"&gt;table salt&lt;/a&gt;; the sodium chloride, NaCl, separates into &lt;a href=\"cation\"&gt;cation&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"anion\"&gt;anion&lt;/a&gt;s, each being surrounded by water molecules. The ions are then easily transported away from their &lt;a href=\"crystal%20lattice\"&gt;crystalline lattice&lt;/a&gt; into solution. An example of a nonionic solute is &lt;a href=\"sucrose\"&gt;table sugar&lt;/a&gt;. The water dipoles make hydrogen bonds with the polar regions of the sugar molecule (OH groups) and allow it to be carried away into solution.\nQuantum tunneling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"quantum%20tunneling\"&gt;quantum tunneling&lt;/a&gt; dynamics in water was reported as early as 1992. At that time it was known that there are motions which destroy and regenerate the weak &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bond\"&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/a&gt; by internal rotations of the substituent water &lt;a href=\"monomers\"&gt;monomers&lt;/a&gt;. On 18 March 2016, it was reported that the hydrogen bond can be broken by quantum tunneling in the water &lt;a href=\"hexamer\"&gt;hexamer&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike previously reported tunneling motions in water, this involved the concerted breaking of two hydrogen bonds. Later in the same year, the discovery of the quantum tunneling of water molecules was reported.\nElectromagnetic absorption.\nWater is relatively transparent to &lt;a href=\"visible%20light\"&gt;visible light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"near%20ultraviolet\"&gt;near ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt; light, and &lt;a href=\"far-red\"&gt;far-red&lt;/a&gt; light, but it absorbs most &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet%20light\"&gt;ultraviolet light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"infrared%20light\"&gt;infrared light&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"microwave\"&gt;microwave&lt;/a&gt;s. Most &lt;a href=\"Photoreceptor%20protein\"&gt;photoreceptors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"photosynthetic%20pigment\"&gt;photosynthetic pigment&lt;/a&gt;s utilize the portion of the light spectrum that is transmitted well through water. &lt;a href=\"Microwave%20ovens\"&gt;Microwave ovens&lt;/a&gt; take advantage of water's opacity to microwave radiation to heat the water inside of foods. Water's light blue colour is caused by weak &lt;a href=\"Absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; in the red part of the &lt;a href=\"visible%20spectrum\"&gt;visible spectrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructure.\nA single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20bond\"&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/a&gt;s because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms. Other molecules like &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20fluoride\"&gt;hydrogen fluoride&lt;/a&gt;, ammonia, and &lt;a href=\"methanol\"&gt;methanol&lt;/a&gt; can also form hydrogen bonds. However, they do not show anomalous &lt;a href=\"thermodynamics\"&gt;thermodynamic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kinematics\"&gt;kinetic&lt;/a&gt; or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are &lt;a href=\"steric\"&gt;steric&lt;/a&gt; effects in bulky residues. In water, intermolecular &lt;a href=\"tetrahedral\"&gt;tetrahedral&lt;/a&gt; structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds, thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network, resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This repeated, constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid. This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\nHowever, there is an alternative theory for the structure of water. In 2004, a controversial paper from &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20University\"&gt;Stockholm University&lt;/a&gt; suggested that water molecules in the liquid state typically bind not to four but only two others; thus forming chains and rings. The term \"string theory of water\" (which is not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"string%20theory\"&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt; of physics) was coined. These observations were based upon X-ray absorption spectroscopy that probed the local environment of individual oxygen atoms.\nMolecular structure.\nThe repulsive effects of the two lone pairs on the oxygen atom cause water to have a &lt;a href=\"Bent%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;bent&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=\"Linear%20molecular%20geometry\"&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt;, molecular structure, allowing it to be polar. The hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen angle is 104.45\u00b0, which is less than the 109.47\u00b0 for ideal &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20hybridisation%23sp3\"&gt;sp3 hybridization&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"valence%20bond%20theory\"&gt;valence bond theory&lt;/a&gt; explanation is that the oxygen atom's lone pairs are physically larger and therefore take up more space than the oxygen atom's bonds to the hydrogen atoms. The &lt;a href=\"molecular%20orbital%20theory\"&gt;molecular orbital theory&lt;/a&gt; explanation (&lt;a href=\"Bent%27s%20rule\"&gt;Bent's rule&lt;/a&gt;) is that lowering the energy of the oxygen atom's nonbonding hybrid orbitals (by assigning them more s character and less p character) and correspondingly raising the energy of the oxygen atom's hybrid orbitals bonded to the hydrogen atoms (by assigning them more p character and less s character) has the net effect of lowering the energy of the occupied molecular orbitals because the energy of the oxygen atom's nonbonding hybrid orbitals contributes completely to the energy of the oxygen atom's lone pairs while the energy of the oxygen atom's other two hybrid orbitals contributes only partially to the energy of the bonding orbitals (the remainder of the contribution coming from the hydrogen atoms' 1s orbitals).\nChemical properties.\nSelf-ionization.\nIn liquid water there is some &lt;a href=\"Self-ionization%20of%20water\"&gt;self-ionization&lt;/a&gt; giving &lt;a href=\"hydronium\"&gt;hydronium&lt;/a&gt; ions and &lt;a href=\"hydroxide\"&gt;hydroxide&lt;/a&gt; ions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"equilibrium%20constant\"&gt;equilibrium constant&lt;/a&gt; for this reaction, known as the &lt;a href=\"self%20ionization%20of%20water\"&gt;ionic product&lt;/a&gt; of water, formula_1, has a value of about at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. At neutral &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt;, the concentration of the &lt;a href=\"hydroxide\"&gt;hydroxide&lt;/a&gt; ion () equals that of the (solvated) hydrogen ion (), with a value close to 10\u22127 mol L\u22121 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. See &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28data%20page%29%23Self-ionization\"&gt;data page&lt;/a&gt; for values at other temperatures.\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant is a quotient of &lt;a href=\"thermodynamic%20activity\"&gt;thermodynamic activities&lt;/a&gt; of all products and reactants including water:\nHowever for dilute solutions, the activity of a solute such as H3O+ or OH\u2212 is approximated by its concentration, and the activity of the solvent H2O is approximated by 1, so that we obtain the simple ionic product formula_3\nGeochemistry.\nThe action of water on rock over long periods of time typically leads to &lt;a href=\"weathering\"&gt;weathering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"water%20erosion\"&gt;water erosion&lt;/a&gt;, physical processes that convert solid rocks and minerals into soil and sediment, but under some conditions chemical reactions with water occur as well, resulting in &lt;a href=\"metasomatism\"&gt;metasomatism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mineral%20hydration\"&gt;mineral hydration&lt;/a&gt;, a type of chemical alteration of a rock which produces &lt;a href=\"clay%20minerals\"&gt;clay minerals&lt;/a&gt;. It also occurs when &lt;a href=\"Portland%20cement\"&gt;Portland cement&lt;/a&gt; hardens.\nWater ice can form &lt;a href=\"clathrate%20compounds\"&gt;clathrate compounds&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"clathrate%20hydrates\"&gt;clathrate hydrates&lt;/a&gt;, with a variety of small molecules that can be embedded in its spacious crystal lattice. The most notable of these is &lt;a href=\"methane%20clathrate\"&gt;methane clathrate&lt;/a&gt;, 4 , naturally found in large quantities on the ocean floor.\nAcidity in nature.\nRain is generally mildly acidic, with a pH between 5.2 and 5.8 if not having any acid stronger than carbon dioxide. If high amounts of &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; oxides are present in the air, they too will dissolve into the cloud and raindrops, producing &lt;a href=\"acid%20rain\"&gt;acid rain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsotopologues.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"isotope\"&gt;isotope&lt;/a&gt;s of both hydrogen and oxygen exist, giving rise to several known &lt;a href=\"isotopologue\"&gt;isotopologue&lt;/a&gt;s of water. &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20Standard%20Mean%20Ocean%20Water\"&gt;Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water&lt;/a&gt; is the current international standard for water isotopes. Naturally occurring water is almost completely composed of the neutron-less hydrogen isotope &lt;a href=\"Hydrogen-1\"&gt;protium&lt;/a&gt;. Only 155 &lt;a href=\"Parts%20per%20million\"&gt;ppm&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"deuterium\"&gt;deuterium&lt;/a&gt; ( or D), a hydrogen isotope with one neutron, and fewer than 20 parts per &lt;a href=\"quintillion\"&gt;quintillion&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"tritium\"&gt;tritium&lt;/a&gt; ( or T), which has two neutrons. Oxygen also has three stable isotopes, with present in 99.76%, in 0.04%, and in 0.2% of water molecules.\nDeuterium oxide, , is also known as &lt;a href=\"heavy%20water\"&gt;heavy water&lt;/a&gt; because of its higher density. It is used in &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20reactor\"&gt;nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt;s as a &lt;a href=\"neutron%20moderator\"&gt;neutron moderator&lt;/a&gt;. Tritium is &lt;a href=\"radioactive\"&gt;radioactive&lt;/a&gt;, decaying with a &lt;a href=\"half-life\"&gt;half-life&lt;/a&gt; of 4500 days; exists in nature only in minute quantities, being produced primarily via cosmic ray-induced nuclear reactions in the atmosphere. Water with one protium and one deuterium atom occur naturally in ordinary water in low concentrations (~0.03%) and in far lower amounts (0.000003%) and any such molecules are temporary as the atoms recombine.\nThe most notable physical differences between and , other than the simple difference in specific mass, involve properties that are affected by hydrogen bonding, such as freezing and boiling, and other kinetic effects. This is because the nucleus of deuterium is twice as heavy as protium, and this causes noticeable differences in bonding energies. The difference in boiling points allows the isotopologues to be separated. The &lt;a href=\"self-diffusion\"&gt;self-diffusion&lt;/a&gt; coefficient of at 25\u00a0\u00b0C is 23% higher than the value of . Because water molecules exchange hydrogen atoms with one another, hydrogen deuterium oxide (DOH) is much more common in low-purity heavy water than pure dideuterium monoxide .\nConsumption of pure isolated may affect biochemical processes \u2013 ingestion of large amounts impairs kidney and central nervous system function. Small quantities can be consumed without any ill-effects; humans are generally unaware of taste differences, but sometimes report a burning sensation or sweet flavor. Very large amounts of heavy water must be consumed for any toxicity to become apparent. Rats, however, are able to avoid heavy water by smell, and it is toxic to many animals.\n&lt;a href=\"Deuterium-depleted%20water\"&gt;\"Light water\"&lt;/a&gt; refers to deuterium-depleted water (DDW), water in which the deuterium content has been reduced below the standard level.\nOccurrence.\nWater is the most abundant substance on Earth and also the third most abundant molecule in the universe, after and . 0.23 ppm of the earth's mass is water and 97.39% of the global water volume of 1.38 km3 is found in the oceans.\nReactions.\nAcid-base reactions.\nWater is &lt;a href=\"amphoteric\"&gt;amphoteric&lt;/a&gt;: it has the ability to act as either an &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"base%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; in chemical reactions. According to the &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%B8nsted-Lowry\"&gt;Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry&lt;/a&gt; definition, an acid is a proton () donor and a base is a proton acceptor. When reacting with a stronger acid, water acts as a base; when reacting with a stronger base, it acts as an acid. For instance, water receives an ion from HCl when &lt;a href=\"hydrochloric%20acid\"&gt;hydrochloric acid&lt;/a&gt; is formed:\nIn the reaction with &lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt;, , water donates a ion, and is thus acting as an acid:\nBecause the oxygen atom in water has two &lt;a href=\"lone%20pair\"&gt;lone pair&lt;/a&gt;s, water often acts as a &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20base\"&gt;Lewis base&lt;/a&gt;, or electron-pair donor, in reactions with &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20acid\"&gt;Lewis acid&lt;/a&gt;s, although it can also react with Lewis bases, forming hydrogen bonds between the electron pair donors and the hydrogen atoms of water. &lt;a href=\"HSAB%20theory\"&gt;HSAB theory&lt;/a&gt; describes water as both a weak hard acid and a weak hard base, meaning that it reacts preferentially with other hard species:\nWhen a salt of a weak acid or of a weak base is dissolved in water, water can partially &lt;a href=\"hydrolysis\"&gt;hydrolyze&lt;/a&gt; the salt, producing the corresponding base or acid, which gives aqueous solutions of &lt;a href=\"soap\"&gt;soap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"baking%20soda\"&gt;baking soda&lt;/a&gt; their basic pH:\nLigand chemistry.\nWater's Lewis base character makes it a common &lt;a href=\"ligand\"&gt;ligand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"transition%20metal\"&gt;transition metal&lt;/a&gt; complexes, examples of which include &lt;a href=\"metal%20aquo%20complex\"&gt;metal aquo complex&lt;/a&gt;es such as to &lt;a href=\"perrhenic%20acid\"&gt;perrhenic acid&lt;/a&gt;, which contains two water molecules coordinated to a &lt;a href=\"rhenium\"&gt;rhenium&lt;/a&gt; center. In solid &lt;a href=\"water%20of%20crystallization\"&gt;hydrates&lt;/a&gt;, water can be either a ligand or simply lodged in the framework, or both. Thus, consists of [Fe2(H2O)6]2+ centers and one \"lattice water\". Water is typically a &lt;a href=\"monodentate\"&gt;monodentate&lt;/a&gt; ligand, i.e., it forms only one bond with the central atom.\nOrganic chemistry.\nAs a hard base, water reacts readily with organic &lt;a href=\"carbocation\"&gt;carbocation&lt;/a&gt;s; for example in a &lt;a href=\"hydration%20reaction\"&gt;hydration reaction&lt;/a&gt;, a hydroxyl group () and an acidic proton are added to the two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in an alcohol. When the addition of water to an organic molecule cleaves the molecule in two, &lt;a href=\"hydrolysis\"&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/a&gt; is said to occur. Notable examples of hydrolysis are the &lt;a href=\"saponification\"&gt;saponification&lt;/a&gt; of fats and the &lt;a href=\"digestion\"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt; of proteins and &lt;a href=\"polysaccharides\"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt;. Water can also be a &lt;a href=\"leaving%20group\"&gt;leaving group&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"SN2%20reaction\"&gt;SN2 substitution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elimination%20reaction\"&gt;E2 elimination&lt;/a&gt; reactions; the latter is then known as a &lt;a href=\"dehydration%20reaction\"&gt;dehydration reaction&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater in redox reactions.\nWater contains hydrogen in the &lt;a href=\"oxidation%20state\"&gt;oxidation state&lt;/a&gt; +1 and oxygen in the oxidation state \u22122. It oxidizes chemicals such as &lt;a href=\"hydrides\"&gt;hydrides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alkali%20metal\"&gt;alkali&lt;/a&gt; metals, and some &lt;a href=\"Alkaline%20earth%20metal\"&gt;alkaline earth&lt;/a&gt; metals. One example of an alkali metal reacting with water is:\nSome other reactive metals, such as &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beryllium\"&gt;beryllium&lt;/a&gt;, are oxidized by water as well, but their oxides adhere to the metal and form a &lt;a href=\"Passivation%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; protective layer. Note that the &lt;a href=\"rusting\"&gt;rusting&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; is a reaction between iron and oxygen that is dissolved in water, not between iron and water.\n&lt;a href=\"Heterogeneous%20water%20oxidation\"&gt;Water can be oxidized&lt;/a&gt; to emit oxygen gas, but very few oxidants react with water even if their reduction potential is greater than the potential of . Almost all such reactions require a &lt;a href=\"catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn example of the oxidation of water is:\nElectrolysis.\nWater can be split into its constituent elements, hydrogen, and oxygen, by passing an electric current through it. This process is called electrolysis.\nThe cathode half reaction is:\nThe anode half reaction is:\nThe gases produced bubble to the surface, where they can be collected or ignited with a flame above the water if this was the intention. The required potential for the electrolysis of pure water is 1.23 V at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The operating potential is actually 1.48 V or higher in practical electrolysis.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Henry%20Cavendish\"&gt;Henry Cavendish&lt;/a&gt; showed that water was composed of oxygen and hydrogen in 1781. The first decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen, by &lt;a href=\"electrolysis\"&gt;electrolysis&lt;/a&gt;, was done in 1800 by English chemist &lt;a href=\"William%20Nicholson%20%28chemist%29\"&gt;William Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Carlisle\"&gt;Anthony Carlisle&lt;/a&gt;. In 1805, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Louis%20Gay-Lussac\"&gt;Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20von%20Humboldt\"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt&lt;/a&gt; showed that water is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen.\n&lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Newton%20Lewis\"&gt;Gilbert Newton Lewis&lt;/a&gt; isolated the first sample of pure &lt;a href=\"heavy%20water\"&gt;heavy water&lt;/a&gt; in 1933.\nThe properties of water have historically been used to define various &lt;a href=\"Temperature%20conversion\"&gt;temperature scales&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, the &lt;a href=\"Kelvin\"&gt;Kelvin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celsius\"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rankine%20scale\"&gt;Rankine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fahrenheit\"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; scales were, or currently are, defined by the freezing and boiling points of water. The less common scales of &lt;a href=\"Delisle%20scale\"&gt;Delisle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newton%20scale\"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9aumur%20scale\"&gt;R\u00e9aumur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B8mer%20scale\"&gt;R\u00f8mer&lt;/a&gt; were defined similarly. The &lt;a href=\"triple%20point\"&gt;triple point&lt;/a&gt; of water is a more commonly used standard point today.\nNomenclature.\nThe accepted &lt;a href=\"IUPAC%20nomenclature%20of%20inorganic%20chemistry\"&gt;IUPAC&lt;/a&gt; name of water is \"oxidane\" or simply \"water\", or its equivalent in different languages, although there are other systematic names which can be used to describe the molecule. Oxidane is only intended to be used as the name of the mononuclear &lt;a href=\"parent%20hydride\"&gt;parent hydride&lt;/a&gt; used for naming derivatives of water by &lt;a href=\"Substitutive%20nomenclature\"&gt;substituent nomenclature&lt;/a&gt;. These derivatives commonly have other recommended names. For example, the name &lt;a href=\"hydroxyl\"&gt;hydroxyl&lt;/a&gt; is recommended over \"oxidanyl\" for the \u2013OH group. The name oxane is explicitly mentioned by the IUPAC as being unsuitable for this purpose, since it is already the name of a cyclic ether also known as &lt;a href=\"tetrahydropyran\"&gt;tetrahydropyran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe simplest systematic name of water is \"hydrogen oxide\". This is analogous to related compounds such as &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20peroxide\"&gt;hydrogen peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"deuterium%20oxide\"&gt;deuterium oxide&lt;/a&gt; (heavy water). Using chemical nomenclature for &lt;a href=\"chemical%20nomenclature%23Type-I%20ionic%20binary%20compounds\"&gt;type I ionic binary compounds&lt;/a&gt;, water would take the name \"hydrogen monoxide\", but this is not among the names published by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry\"&gt;International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; (IUPAC). Another name is \"dihydrogen monoxide\", which is a rarely used name of water, and mostly used in the &lt;a href=\"dihydrogen%20monoxide%20parody\"&gt;dihydrogen monoxide parody&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther systematic names for water include \"hydroxic acid\", \"hydroxylic acid\", and \"hydrogen hydroxide\", using acid and base names. None of these exotic names are used widely. The polarized form of the water molecule, , is also called &lt;a href=\"hydron%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;hydron&lt;/a&gt; hydroxide by IUPAC nomenclature.\n\"Water substance\" is a term used for hydrogen oxide (H2O) when one does not wish to specify whether one is speaking of liquid &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steam\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt;, some form of &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, or a component in a mixture or mineral."
