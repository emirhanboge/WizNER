    "text": "Louis Frank Klein (October 22, 1918 \u2013 June 20, 1976) was an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;. During his active career he was an &lt;a href=\"infielder\"&gt;infielder&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major Leagues&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Athletics\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, and was known as one of the players who \"jumped\" to the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20League\"&gt;Mexican League&lt;/a&gt; in . He was then suspended by &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Baseball\"&gt;Commissioner of Baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Happy%20Chandler\"&gt;Happy Chandler&lt;/a&gt; for a five-year span, although the suspension was later reduced. \nBorn in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, Klein attended Peters High School in that city. As a player, he was listed as tall and and threw and batted right-handed.\nPlaying career.\nKlein's professional career began as a &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; at age 21 in the Cardinals' &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt;. He rose from Class D, the lowest level, in 1940 all the way to the top-level &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Red%20Birds\"&gt;Columbus Red Birds&lt;/a&gt; in 1941, and needed only three years of &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; seasoning to reach the big leagues.\nIn his &lt;a href=\"rookie\"&gt;rookie&lt;/a&gt; season in the Majors, with the reigning world champion &lt;a href=\"1943%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;1943 Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, Klein was a strong contributor to the Redbirds' successful defence of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pennant%20%28sports%29\"&gt;pennant&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in 154 of the club's 157 official games, started 32 &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; at shortstop, and then succeeded &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Brown%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jimmy Brown&lt;/a&gt; as St. Louis' regular &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt; (119 starts) when Brown entered World War II military service. Klein &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; a career-high .287 and was second on the Cardinals in &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; (180), &lt;a href=\"runs%20scored\"&gt;runs scored&lt;/a&gt; (91) and &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triples&lt;/a&gt; (14)\u2014behind only &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Musial\"&gt;Stan Musial&lt;/a&gt;, an eventual &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;r. During the &lt;a href=\"1943%20World%20Series\"&gt;1943 World Series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, he started all five games at second base but he collected only three hits, all &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;singles&lt;/a&gt;, in 22 &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;s and the Cardinals fell to the Yankees, four games to one. Klein then joined the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, serving in &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and missed all of and most of the season.\nWhen he returned to the Cardinals in September 1945, he battled for playing time on a talent-loaded team. Klein believed his future role in St. Louis would be limited as a utility player backing up the younger &lt;a href=\"Red%20Schoendienst\"&gt;Red Schoendienst&lt;/a&gt; (a future Hall of Famer himself). Only two months into the &lt;a href=\"1946%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1946&lt;/a&gt; season, with the Cardinals in the first place, he jumped to the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20League\"&gt;Mexican League&lt;/a&gt;, along with teammates &lt;a href=\"Max%20Lanier\"&gt;Max Lanier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Martin%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Fred Martin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the spring of 1946, the &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Pasquel\"&gt;Pasquel brothers&lt;/a&gt; of the Mexican League had been making enticing offers to many low-paid Major Leaguers perpetually bound to their teams by the &lt;a href=\"reserve%20clause\"&gt;reserve clause&lt;/a&gt;. The trio of Cardinals was the latest group to accept. In an attempt to slow this exodus, Chandler banned all players who broke their existing contracts to join the Mexican League, including Klein, from &lt;a href=\"Organized%20Baseball\"&gt;Organized Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for a span of five years. On June 5, 1949, Chandler lifted the bans on the Mexican League jumpers, and eleven days later, Klein returned to the Cardinals. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporting%20News\"&gt;The Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that he paid $1,500 out of his own pocket to buy his release from his &lt;a href=\"independent%20league%20baseball\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; club in the &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20Provincial%20League\"&gt;Quebec Provincial League&lt;/a&gt; to rejoin Organized Baseball.\nCoach and manager.\nKlein's suspension-interrupted postwar MLB playing career was a far cry from his 1943 success. In 100 games for the Cardinals (1945\u201346; 1949), and 51 more with the Indians and Athletics (1951), he collected only 89 hits in 410 at bats (.217) and played full years in the minor leagues in 1950 and 1952\u201353. Altogether he batted .259 in 305 MLB games, his 269 hits including 45 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt;, 15 triples (only one after 1943) and 16 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s. He had 101 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlein became a &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; in 1955. In &lt;a href=\"1960%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;, he began the season as a &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; for the MLB Cubs for half a season before swapping jobs with &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Missions\"&gt;San Antonio Missions&lt;/a&gt;' manager &lt;a href=\"Grady%20Hatton\"&gt;Grady Hatton&lt;/a&gt; in midyear.\nThen, in , he was named to the infamous &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Coaches\"&gt;College of Coaches&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a brainchild of owner &lt;a href=\"Philip%20K.%20Wrigley\"&gt;Philip K. Wrigley&lt;/a&gt;, who decided to abolish the position of field manager and instead rotate \"head coaches\" to run the Cubs and their &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; affiliates. Klein was in charge of the Cubs for 11 games between September 1\u201310, 1961, and compiled a 5\u20136 &lt;a href=\"win%E2%80%93loss%20record\"&gt;win\u2013loss record&lt;/a&gt; as head coach. He'd actually helmed clubs as low as Class D (the equivalent of a &lt;a href=\"Rookie-level\"&gt;Rookie-level&lt;/a&gt; team today) during the season.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1962%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, Klein was named head coach again, replacing &lt;a href=\"El%20Tappe\"&gt;El Tappe&lt;/a&gt; and managing 30 games between May 1 and June 3 (posting a 12\u201318 record). The 1962 Cubs finished 59\u2013103 \u2014 their first time ever with a 100-loss season, and still the worst in franchise history. Only the 40\u2013120 &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; were worse. In &lt;a href=\"1965%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, Klein was named to a third stint as head coach, replacing &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Kennedy\"&gt;Bob Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; on June 14 and staying on through the rest of the season. The last head coach in the history of the College of Coaches, Klein went 48\u201358 in 1965, and finished with a lifetime 65\u201382 (&lt;a href=\"winning%20percentage\"&gt;.442&lt;/a&gt;) record. He remained in the Cub organization as a &lt;a href=\"scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;.\nKlein died in &lt;a href=\"Metairie%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Metairie, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, at age 57 after suffering a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;."
