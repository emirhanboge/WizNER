Fitrat claimed he was under threat for investigating fraud at the privately owned Kabul Bank. Delawari had a good record from his previous stint as director of the bank, the trusted acquaintance of Karzai kept his position until he handed in his resignation on 6 December 2014. Delawari currently serves as Co-Chairman of The Private Sector and Civil Society Enabling Council."
