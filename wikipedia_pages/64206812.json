    "text": "Jukka Mallinen (b. 3 June 1950 &lt;a href=\"Lahti\"&gt;Lahti&lt;/a&gt;) is a Finnish author, poet, translator and interpreter.\nMallinen studied literature at the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20State%20University\"&gt;Moscow State University&lt;/a&gt; during 1972\u201378. He wrote his master's thesis on &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bulgakov\"&gt;Mikhail Bulgakov&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s work \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20Margarita\"&gt;The Master and Margarita&lt;/a&gt;\". During 1979\u201389 he worked for Finnish businesses involved in trade with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. for &lt;a href=\"Kone\"&gt;Kone&lt;/a&gt;. During 1993\u201395 he was the head of &lt;a href=\"The%20Finnish%20Institute%20in%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;The Finnish Institute in St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1998 he has worked as an independent translator, translating &lt;a href=\"Russian%20literature\"&gt;Russian literature&lt;/a&gt;, both prose and poetry. During 2006\u201309 he acted as the president of the Finnish branch of &lt;a href=\"PEN%20International\"&gt;PEN International&lt;/a&gt;.\nMallinen on Russia.\nMallinen studied in the Philological Faculty of Moscow State University during 1972\u201378. He says that during that time his eyes were opened, when he made acquaintances with the literary underworld. He went to Moscow as a &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;, but he returned to Finland as an anticommunist. Even in those years, \"the Philological Faculty was full of dissidents, and people there read widely forbidden literature. A sturdy East German Erika &lt;a href=\"typewriter\"&gt;typewriter&lt;/a&gt; could handle four sheets of paper, with &lt;a href=\"carbon%20paper\"&gt;carbon paper&lt;/a&gt; between the sheets: One could borrow a popular work for a night, if one delivered four copies of it to the lender. One could keep one copy,\u201d Mallinen says. Even during his student days, Mallinen smuggled forbidden literature from the Soviet Union to Finland. Later, when he worked for Finnish businesses, he translated e. g. the poems of &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Limonov\"&gt;Eduard Limonov&lt;/a&gt;. He was somewhat scared at the time, since if he had been found out, he could have lost his visa, and then he would have had to look for other employment.\nMallinen has written on his views on Russia in his first book entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Varastettua%20ilmaa\"&gt;Varastettua ilmaa&lt;/a&gt;\" (\u2018stolen air\u2019, 2008). He is worried about the current state of affairs in Russia. He compares &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;, and he sees parallels between Russia and &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The Russian regime wants to squash the civil rights. The regime represents \"neo-barbarism\", with a cult of power, hierarchical organization and the lack of &lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20law\"&gt;rule of law&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;nationalism&lt;/a&gt; promoted by the dominant culture wants to stifle multiculturalism, and it leads to stagnation and fossilization of culture. The &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; has allied itself with &lt;a href=\"militarism\"&gt;militarism&lt;/a&gt; and the current regime, and the nationalism is mixed with patriotism, racism and &lt;a href=\"xenophobia\"&gt;xenophobia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Mallinen, racist views are the mainstream in Russia. He says that the Russian mainstream represents &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20P.%20Huntington\"&gt;Huntingtonian&lt;/a&gt; cultural racism, which does not classify people according to their colour of skin, but according to their values. The Finnish critics of &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, such as represented by &lt;a href=\"Timo%20Vihavainen\"&gt;Timo Vihavainen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jussi%20Halla-aho\"&gt;Jussi Halla-aho&lt;/a&gt;, have imported their ideas from Russia.\nAccording to Mallinen, in Russian history, &lt;a href=\"Finnic%20peoples\"&gt;Finnic peoples&lt;/a&gt; have been silenced.\nMallinen has quite a bleak view on Putin's Russia: the regime wants to recreate the Soviet regime:\nMallinen considers the &lt;a href=\"Finland-Russia%20Society\"&gt;Finland-Russia Society&lt;/a&gt; a stooge of the &lt;a href=\"Kremlin\"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;, transformed as such by &lt;a href=\"Heikki%20Talvitie\"&gt;Heikki Talvitie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paula%20Lehtom%C3%A4ki\"&gt;Paula Lehtom\u00e4ki&lt;/a&gt;. In the magazine of the society, \"&lt;a href=\"Ven%C3%A4j%C3%A4n%20Aika\"&gt;Ven\u00e4j\u00e4n Aika&lt;/a&gt;\", Mallinen has been likened to &lt;a href=\"Johan%20B%C3%A4ckman\"&gt;Johan B\u00e4ckman&lt;/a&gt;, and the dialogue between the two has been labeled \"quarrels of village idiots\".\nMallinen as the head of Finnish PEN.\nDuring 2006\u201309 Mallinen served as the president of the Finnish PEN. He raised the profile of PEN by his active engagement in cultural discussion, and he commented e. g. on Russian affairs and on the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;Commonwealth of Independent States&lt;/a&gt;. For example, PEN was among the organizers of the candle protests outside the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Embassy%20in%20Finland\"&gt;Russian Embassy in Finland&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, after the murder of &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Politkovskaya\"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Mallinen's presidency, there were some controversies concerning Russia within the Finnish PEN. He was criticized by vice president &lt;a href=\"Rita%20Dahl\"&gt;Rita Dahl&lt;/a&gt;, and also the board of trustees were divided. Dahl said Mallinen was a publicity seeker, and she accused him of curbing free speech and of \"neo-&lt;a href=\"Finlandization\"&gt;Finlandization&lt;/a&gt;.\nMallinen said he was being persecuted by the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Tiedonantaja\"&gt;Tiedonantaja&lt;/a&gt;\", that he was the spitting bowl of Putinists and that authoritarian and dictatorial elements were trying to infiltrate the Finnish PEN."
