Eric Torres Garcia claims to have posted the first cocoa bombs video on TikTok. Since then, many people have attempted to recreate the dessert as well as create their own signature chocolate bombs.\n2021.\nBaked feta cheese pasta.\nThe simplicity and ease of creating the dish is something that has allowed the recipe to go viral. The dish is made using a few simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a block of feta cheese, olive oil, pasta, basil, and garlic. In 2019, a Finnish food blogger name Jenni Hayrinen developed the dish but it only went on to became viral in February of 2021. The trend became so popular that it caused a shortage of feta cheese in Finnish grocery stores.\nNature's cereal.\nNature's cereal is a trend on TikTok developed by user @natures_food in March of 2021, where traditional cereal is replaced with fruit; and the milk is replaced with coconut water. Some users claim this cereal relieves constipation and gives people energy. One factor that has boosted the popularity of this trend is the attention it received from singer &lt;a href=\"Lizzo\"&gt;Lizzo&lt;/a&gt; who posted several videos of herself enjoying nature's cereal.\nPesto eggs.\nPesto eggs is a TikTok food trend involving the substitution of &lt;a href=\"pesto\"&gt;pesto&lt;/a&gt; sauce for oil when cooking eggs on a stovetop. The technique is successful since pesto sauce already contains olive oil as a primary ingredient. Amy Wilichowsky, a &lt;a href=\"dietitian\"&gt;dietitian&lt;/a&gt; and TikToker, shared this of cooking eggs on the social media platform on April 24, 2021, and is credited as the creator of the trend.

The hashtag #FrozenHoney achieved nearly 600 million views by the start of August according to the company. The origin of the trend is unclear, although \"&lt;a href=\"NBC%20News\"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that ASMR creators had previously consumed frozen honey in their YouTube videos because their audiences found the noise satisfying to listen to. However, \"NBC News\" reported that some users on the app had experienced &lt;a href=\"diarrhea\"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise felt sick. The article speculated that the cause could be the amount consumed, saying that while honey does not pose a health risk in small amounts, eating an excessive amount can cause diarrhea or dental issues.\nLeftover salmon bowl.\nThe salmon rice bowl trend was originally developed by TikTok lifestyle influencer, Emily Mariko. The recipe was first introduced on August 25, 2021, but was revised multiple times with the final variation uploaded on September 21, 2021. The video received forty million views and inspired one hundred and fifty-five videos with related content. In this dish, mashed salmon and rice are heated in a microwave and then covered in mayonnaise, soy sauce, and sriracha. It is consumed with kimchi and dried seaweed squares. Mariko heats the dish with an ice cube on top to steam the rice while it is heating up. This salmon rice bowl is easy to make due to its simple and few ingredients, under 5 minute cooking time, and incorporation of leftover salmon.\nFlamin' Hot Cheetos salad.\nTikTok user @rxthism created a viral recipe by adding Flamin' Hot Cheetos to a salad mix. With over four and a half million views, this mixture of cucumbers, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, hot sauce, cilantro, and lemon juice has sparked substantial interest. The implementation of \u201cjunk\u201d food into a regular dish has become a new trend in FoodTok as of November 2021, and more creative dishes of the sort have been created in response.\nNotable figures.\nEitan Bernanth.\n&lt;a href=\"Eitan%20Bernath\"&gt;Eitan Bernanth&lt;/a&gt; is a 19-year-old TikTok star with over 1.6 million followers on the platform as of May 2021.

Her signature salmon dish, along with the lack of music and filler audio in contrast to most TikTok culinary videos, has created a following of over 6 million people.\nJeremy Scheck.\nWith over 2 million followers on TikTok, Jeremy Scheck is a college student\u00a0 and creates culinary content that focuses on culture, nutrition, and humor. He quickly found success after taking classes relating to dairy science, nutrition, and &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulture&lt;/a&gt;. His nutritional commentary and cultural references stem from his university coursework.\nJessica Woo.\nAs a mom of three, Jessica Woo documents her process for packing her kids\u2019 lunches.

However, many of these posts are created by users who lack professional qualifications to promote these ideas. Quite often, these food trends are associated with lifestyle tips, therefore influencing their diet, daily tasks, and personal routine. On the other hand, TikTok food trends can encourage and stimulate &lt;a href=\"Body%20positivity\"&gt;body-positivity&lt;/a&gt; and allow people to promote the importance of self-satisfaction relating to &lt;a href=\"body%20image\"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt; if they so desire. These food trends can be an opportunity to express themselves and their personal diet choices, while also not conforming to the ideas created by novice users.\nFood shortages.\nTikTok food trends have also caused food shortages of ingredients highlighted in &lt;a href=\"viral%20video\"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, the baked feta cheese pasta trend resulted in feta cheese shortages. \u00a0Saxelby Cheesemongers, a cheese seller based in Rhode Island was affected by this shortage. Its warehouse in Brooklyn usually sells about two-thousand pounds of cheese per week to their regular customers in the city. However, after the video of feta cheese pasta was released, its distributor stated there was none in stock. Other cheese companies, such as Winnimere, reported similar impacts.\nIncreased popularity of youth cooking.\nThe easy-to-follow nature of TikTok food trends, recipes, and tutorial videos has led to an increase in youth interaction with the platform. TikTok has proved itself to be an accessible platform for teaching youth groups about basic cooking skills and nutrition. The short duration of TikTok videos on the has requires more compressed and clear recipes, taking away from the complexity usually associated with cooking. With 92% of U.S. adolescents having access to the Internet on a daily basis, TikTok has become an extremely accessible source of information for them to gain practical information, including cooking skills.\nA popular trend for college students was a tortilla wrap folded into 4 triangular pieces and filling it in with at home ingredients such as veggies, cold meats, etc. Jeremy Scheck, an undergraduate at &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, began to create TikTok content about his passion for food and his recipes when the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. When school transitioned online, Scheck shared trending recipes such as crispy potatoes and fried rice that sparked interest for college students like himself.\nPopularity of TikTok recipes among college students may stem from their interest in staying away from fast food. These trends also help college students feel more comfortable in the kitchen.\nMarketing.\nTikTok has turned into a &lt;a href=\"Marketing\"&gt;marketing platform&lt;/a&gt; for many brands as cooking-related products gained popularity in the past year. Surveys have proven that using TikTok as a marketing tool has been a successful investment for restaurants or individual food items. The instant feedback allows each company to discover what factors affect the popularity of their products through both reactions to and numbers of views of posts. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Nutter%20Butter\"&gt;Nutter Butter's&lt;/a&gt; TikTok has repeatedly dueted TikTok stars including &lt;a href=\"Bella%20Poarch\"&gt;Bella Poarch&lt;/a&gt; to reach a larger audience. Another example is when &lt;a href=\"Dunkin%27%20Donuts\"&gt;Dunkin\u2019 Donuts&lt;/a&gt; launched a collaboration with TikTok star &lt;a href=\"Charli%20D%27Amelio\"&gt;Charli D\u2019Amelio&lt;/a&gt; to promote a new beverage and the corporation as a whole. From this, Dunkin\u2019 cold brew sales rose 20% and 45% respectively in the first two days after the launch. On top of that, the first collaboration video concluded with a 57% increase in the Dunkin\u2019 &lt;a href=\"mobile%20app\"&gt;mobile app&lt;/a&gt; downloads (corresponding to downloads within 90 days preceding).\nIt also benefits corporations by providing recommendations to improve their marketing strategy, food items, d\u00e9cor, or any other factor illustrated in the ad. Some input that drives future marketing decisions on platforms like TikTok would include the attractiveness of the items advertised, innovation regarding new and interesting products, and the level of ease for the consumer to purchase the product after seeing the post. Drivers such as these can eliminate possible negative connotations surrounding a product and influence positive reinforcement, feedback, and action for and by the consumer. An example of a company that implements these strategies is &lt;a href=\"Chipotle%20Mexican%20Grill\"&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill&lt;/a&gt;. One of their social campaigns is creating TikTok challenges like #GuacDance and #Boorito, in which they create interactive content that follows current social media trends to stimulate an increase in revenue. In particular, #GuacDance became the largest \u201cbranded\u201d challenge in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with hundreds of thousands of user responses within the week-long event. This campaign resulted in the more than 800,000 sides of guacamole given out on July 31, 2019."
