    "text": "The 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry was a regular &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt; regiment in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Indian%20Army\"&gt;British Indian Army&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20independence%20movement\"&gt;independence of India&lt;/a&gt;, the regiment was allotted to the Indian Army and redesignated as the 18th Cavalry.\nFormation.\nTracing its origins from 1842, the regiment was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of the &lt;a href=\"6th%20King%20Edward%27s%20Own%20Cavalry\"&gt;6th King Edward's Own Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Hariana%20Lancers\"&gt;7th Hariana Lancers&lt;/a&gt;. These two regiments too had undergone many changes \u2013 \nThe composition of the regiment at the time of amalgamation was &lt;a href=\"Qaimkhani\"&gt;Kaimkhanis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajputana\"&gt;Rajputana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rajput\"&gt;Rajput&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Jat%20people\"&gt;Jats&lt;/a&gt;. The present class composition is of Jats from &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haryana\"&gt;Haryana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rajasthan\"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;; Rajputs from Uttar Pradesh, &lt;a href=\"Madhya%20Pradesh\"&gt;Madhya Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; and Rajasthan and Hindustani Mussalmans from all over India, but mainly from Uttar Pradesh and &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperations during the British Raj.\nSecond World War.\nIn December 1940, during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the regiment was mechanized. It formed part of the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Indian%20Motor%20Brigade\"&gt;3rd Indian Motor Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially part of the &lt;a href=\"31st%20Indian%20Armoured%20Division\"&gt;1st Indian Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe brigade was detached from the division, and dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; along with its units including the 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry. The regiment then served in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Desert%20campaign\"&gt;Western Desert campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The regiment, and the brigade, were attached to a number of different formations that included the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;2nd Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;7th Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"9th%20Australian%20Division\"&gt;9th Australian Division&lt;/a&gt; who they were with during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Tobruk\"&gt;Siege of Tobruk&lt;/a&gt;. The regiment also supplied men for the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Long%20Range%20Squadron\"&gt;Indian Long Range Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. The brigade was later overrun by the Italians during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gazala\"&gt;Battle of Gazala&lt;/a&gt;, and took some days to reform. After the brigade reformed, the regiment was equipped as follows: Cavalry Carrier - 2 x Reconnaissance Squadron, 1 x AT Squadron.\nOn 30 June, the brigade was ordered to hand over 50 per cent of its vehicles to the Eighth Army, and was dispersed and the regiment was allotted to the defence of the Nile Delta and guard duties. In August, the brigade reformed and was allocated the regiment. It travelled overland to Sahneh, in Persia via Baghdad, and was placed under the command of the 31st Indian Armoured Division (formally the 1st Indian Armoured Division). In late November it then moved to &lt;a href=\"Shaibah\"&gt;Shaibah&lt;/a&gt;, from Basra. From here the regiment returned to India in January 1943, and the brigade was reconstituted as the &lt;a href=\"43rd%20Independent%20Gurkha%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;43rd Indian Infantry Brigade (Lorried)&lt;/a&gt; at Shaibah at the end of January 1943. In the middle of the year, it moved to Rawalpindi and commenced conversion to a light cruiser regiment. By the end of the year, the regiment successfully converted into a light cruiser tank regiment. The regiment was split up after that, serving in different parts of India when the Japanese surrender came in August 1945.\n18th King Edward's Own Cavalry won the following gallantry awards during the Second World War -\nOperations in independent India.\nIndo-Pakistani War of 1965.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201965\"&gt;Indo-Pakistani War of 1965&lt;/a&gt;, the regiment fought a series of isolated armour battles as part of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28India%29\"&gt;1st Armoured Division&lt;/a&gt; in the approaches to &lt;a href=\"Sialkot\"&gt;Sialkot&lt;/a&gt;.
