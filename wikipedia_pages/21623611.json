    "text": "SM \"UC-15\" was a German &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20UC%20I%20submarine\"&gt;Type UC I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;German Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; () during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. The U-boat was ordered on 23 November 1914, &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 28 January 1915, and was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt;ed on 19 May 1915. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;ed into the German Imperial Navy on 28 June 1915 as SM \"UC-15\". &lt;a href=\"Naval%20mines\"&gt;Mines&lt;/a&gt; laid by \"UC-15\" during her eight patrols are credited with sinking 3 ships. \"UC-15\" disappeared in November 1916.\nDesign.\nA &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20UC%20I%20submarine\"&gt;German Type UC I submarine&lt;/a&gt;, \"UC-15\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;length overall&lt;/a&gt; of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28ship%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by one &lt;a href=\"Benz%20S%C3%B6hne\"&gt;Benz&lt;/a&gt; six-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine producing , an electric motor producing , and one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;. She was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, she could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"UC-15\" was fitted with six mine tubes, twelve UC 120 mines, and one machine gun. She was built by &lt;a href=\"AG%20Weser\"&gt;AG Weser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; was fourteen crew members.\nLoss.\nAfter completion, \"UC-15\" joined the &lt;a href=\"Constantinople%20Flotilla\"&gt;Constantinople Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; and became the Flotilla's only minelaying submarine in November 1915, after her sister ship \"&lt;a href=\"SM%20UC-13\"&gt;UC-13&lt;/a&gt;\" was accidentally grounded and subsequently destroyed by her crew. In November 1916, \"UC-15\" was sent on a minelaying mission off the Romanian port of &lt;a href=\"Sulina\"&gt;Sulina&lt;/a&gt; and never returned, being sunk by her own mines. This was probably caused by an encounter with the Romanian torpedo boat \"&lt;a href=\"NMS%20Smeul\"&gt;Smeul&lt;/a&gt;\", whose captain surprised a German submarine near Sulina in November 1916, the latter reportedly never returning to her base at &lt;a href=\"Varna%2C%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Varna&lt;/a&gt;. This could only be \"UC-15\", whose systems most likely malfunctioned after being forced to submerge in the shallow waters, upon encountering the Romanian torpedo boat."
