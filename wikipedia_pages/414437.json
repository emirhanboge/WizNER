    "text": "Anthony Louis Banks, Baron Stratford (8 April 1942 \u2013 8 January 2006) was a British politician who served as &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Sport%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Minister for Sport&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 to 1999. A member of the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, he was a &lt;a href=\"member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1983%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2005%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently as a &lt;a href=\"member%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;member of the House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;. He was well known in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; for his acid tongue.\nCareer before politics.\nBanks was born at the Jubilee Maternity Hospital, &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, the only son and elder child of Albert Herbert Banks, a sergeant in the Royal Army Service Corps who before the Second World War had been a toolmaker, and his wife, Olive Irene (Rene), \"&lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" Rusca. The family returned to England after the birth, and he grew up in &lt;a href=\"Brixton\"&gt;Brixton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tooting\"&gt;Tooting&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated at St John's School, Brixton, and &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Tenison%27s%20Church%20of%20England%20School%2C%20Lambeth\"&gt;Tenison's School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kennington\"&gt;Kennington&lt;/a&gt;. He failed his \"O\" Levels and left school to work as a clerk for a few years, but studied at night school to gain the qualifications necessary for university. From 1964 to 1967 he studied politics at the University of York, where he was President of the Student Representative Council. He graduated with an upper-second degree in 1967, then undertook further study at the London School of Economics.\nBanks then became a trade union official, first for the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, from 1969 to 1975, then as Assistant General Secretary of the Association of Broadcasting Staff, from 1976 to 1983 (it later merged with other unions to form the &lt;a href=\"Broadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union\"&gt;Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union&lt;/a&gt; or BECTU). For several years Banks was responsible for freelancers.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1964 Banks unsuccessfully stood for the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; in the first elections for the London Borough Councils that began operation in 1965. He later joined the Labour Party. He was a member of Lambeth Council from 1971 to 1974, and during the 1970s and 1980s he was a prominent member of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London%20Council\"&gt;Greater London Council&lt;/a&gt; (GLC), representing &lt;a href=\"Hammersmith\"&gt;Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt; (1970\u20131977) and &lt;a href=\"Tooting\"&gt;Tooting&lt;/a&gt; (1981\u20131986). He was Chairman of the GLC from 1985 until its abolition in 1986.\nHaving unsuccessfully contested &lt;a href=\"East%20Grinstead%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;East Grinstead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1970%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne North&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"October%201974%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;October 1974&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1979%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;, Banks won &lt;a href=\"Newham%20North%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Newham North West&lt;/a&gt; for Labour in &lt;a href=\"1983%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, defeating his predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Lewis%20%28British%20politician%29\"&gt;Arthur Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, who had been deselected as Labour's candidate. Following a boundary review in 1995, Newham North West was expanded and renamed &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1997%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;general election in 1997&lt;/a&gt;. Banks retained the seat until &lt;a href=\"2005%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, when he stood down.\nMinisterial post.\nAfter Labour's election victory in 1997 Banks was appointed Minister for Sport in the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt;. He called for foreign players in the English Premiership to become eligible to play for England: \"Can you imagine seeing &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Cantona\"&gt;Cantona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Giggs\"&gt;Giggs&lt;/a&gt; swapping the Red of Manchester for the White of England?\" He also suggested that the football teams of the four constituent parts of the UK should merge to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, as eventually occurred in 2012. However his calling for one UK football team in 1997 was met with ridicule from supporters and one colleague, the Scottish Labour MP &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Galbraith\"&gt;Sam Galbraith&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the creation of such a team would only happen \"over his dead body\". Banks also offended &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s supporters by describing the team as the \"West Ham of world football - they never quite perform to their potential\"\nAmong Banks's ministerial responsibilities were &lt;a href=\"listed%20buildings\"&gt;listed buildings&lt;/a&gt;, and he approved controversial additions including the 1930s Three Magpies pub in Birmingham and numerous redundant &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service\"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; buildings. He was also responsible for Grade I listing the &lt;a href=\"Severn%20Bridge\"&gt;Severn Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two years in office he stepped down to become the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;'s envoy for England's bid to host the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The bid failed and Germany won instead. From then until his retirement from the Commons in 2005 Banks remained a backbencher, though he made a failed bid to become Labour's candidate in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20London%20mayoral%20election\"&gt;election for Mayor of London in 2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical views.\nBanks was a vegetarian, a supporter of &lt;a href=\"animal%20rights\"&gt;animal rights&lt;/a&gt; and a Vice-President of the &lt;a href=\"League%20Against%20Cruel%20Sports\"&gt;League Against Cruel Sports&lt;/a&gt;. He was regarded as on the left of Labour, being a &lt;a href=\"British%20republican%20movement\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt;, an opponent of the &lt;a href=\"2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq\"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Campaign%20Group\"&gt;Socialist Campaign Group&lt;/a&gt;. His only speeches regarding the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;2001 invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; involved requests for government money and the help of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; for the animals of the &lt;a href=\"Kabul%20Zoo\"&gt;Kabul Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for &lt;a href=\"Marjan%20%28lion%29\"&gt;Marjan&lt;/a&gt;, an elderly lion that needed air-conditioning for its &lt;a href=\"rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatism&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 21 May 2004 Banks proposed an &lt;a href=\"Early%20Day%20Motion\"&gt;Early Day Motion&lt;/a&gt; in response to newspaper reports that &lt;a href=\"MI5\"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt; had proposed using &lt;a href=\"pigeon\"&gt;pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s as flying bombs during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. The motion condemned the proposal, described human beings as \"obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal\", and proposed that the House \"looks forward to the day when the inevitable &lt;a href=\"asteroid\"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt; slams into the Earth and wipes them out, thus giving nature the opportunity to start again\".\nBanks was also a supporter of the arts and chaired the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; Works of Art Committee, which had responsibility for historic paintings and sculptures in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutspoken behaviour.\nIn 1990, responding to a speech by the Conservative MP &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Dicks\"&gt;Terry Dicks&lt;/a&gt; opposing government funding for the arts, Banks said that Dicks was \"living proof that a &lt;a href=\"pig%27s%20bladder\"&gt;pig's bladder&lt;/a&gt; on a stick can get elected to Parliament\". Banks also described another Conservative MP, &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Soames\"&gt;Nicholas Soames&lt;/a&gt;, as \"a one-man food mountain\". Banks referred to Canadians as \"dickheads\" for culling &lt;a href=\"Pinniped\"&gt;seals&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a question on &lt;a href=\"Basildon\"&gt;Basildon&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s maternity services in 1994, Banks remarked that then Conservative MP for the area, &lt;a href=\"David%20Amess\"&gt;David Amess&lt;/a&gt; had (as the father of five children) \"put far too much pressure on Basildon\u2019s maternity services and suggested he use \"a do-it-yourself &lt;a href=\"vasectomy\"&gt;vasectomy&lt;/a&gt; kit with two bricks.\"\nAt the Labour Party conference in 1997 Banks described &lt;a href=\"William%20Hague\"&gt;William Hague&lt;/a&gt;, then Leader of the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, as a \"&lt;a href=\"foetus\"&gt;foetus&lt;/a&gt;\", adding that Conservative MPs might be rethinking their views on abortion.\nBanks &lt;a href=\"Crossed%20fingers\"&gt;crossed his fingers&lt;/a&gt; when he took the &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20Allegiance%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;oath of allegiance&lt;/a&gt; to the Queen during a new session of &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. Banks said that he was wishing himself luck in his new job as Minister for Sport.\nPersonal life.\nBanks was married to Sally Jones. He was a keen supporter of &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and regularly attended matches. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Humanist%20Association\"&gt;British Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetirement.\nOn 23 November 2004, Banks announced that he would not stand at the next general election and that he would retire from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;. Three days later, in an interview with &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Oakley\"&gt;Robin Oakley&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%204\"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;, he said \"To be honest, I found it intellectually numbing and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems, and we did deal with them, ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being Chairman of the Works of Art Committee . . . because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history.\"\nOn 24 March 2005 he made his final speech in the House of Commons. A week after the general election, on 13 May 2005, it was announced that he would be created a &lt;a href=\"life%20peer\"&gt;life peer&lt;/a&gt;, and on 23 June 2005 the peerage was gazetted as Baron Stratford, of &lt;a href=\"Stratford%2C%20London\"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Newham\"&gt;London Borough of Newham&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nOn 7 January 2006, Banks was reported to have collapsed two days earlier after suffering a massive stroke while having lunch on &lt;a href=\"Sanibel%20Island\"&gt;Sanibel Island&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, where he was on holiday. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Fort Myers&lt;/a&gt; and died on 8 January without regaining consciousness. The Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Blair\"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, described him as \"one of the most charismatic politicians in Britain, a true man of the people\".\nHis funeral was held on 21 January at the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; Crematorium. &lt;a href=\"John%20Prescott\"&gt;John Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tessa%20Jowell\"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Beckett\"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alastair%20Campbell\"&gt;Alastair Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Benn\"&gt;Tony Benn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Smith%2C%20Baron%20Smith%20of%20Finsbury\"&gt;Chris Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Caborn\"&gt;Richard Caborn&lt;/a&gt; attended. Banks's friend, Conservative MP &lt;a href=\"David%20Mellor\"&gt;David Mellor&lt;/a&gt;, gave an address paying tribute. \"A lord of misrule, a cheeky chappy, call him what you will\u2014he can be defined but he cannot be replaced,\" said Mellor.\nFollowing her husband's death, Lady Stratford vowed to continue his animal rights work, leading a campaign against the culling of &lt;a href=\"Pinniped\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; pups in Canada. She is also a patron of the &lt;a href=\"Captive%20Animals%20Protection%20Society\"&gt;Captive Animals Protection Society&lt;/a&gt;, a charity campaigning for an end to the use of animals in circuses, zoos and the exotic pet trade.\nIn popular culture.\n\"The Wit and Wisdom of Tony Banks\", edited by &lt;a href=\"Iain%20Dale\"&gt;Iain Dale&lt;/a&gt;, was published in 1998.\nHis death on 8 January 2006 was referenced in the first series of &lt;a href=\"the%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Show\"&gt;the Ricky Gervais Show&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Pilkington\"&gt;Karl Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;\u2018s diary of his holiday to &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Canaria\"&gt;Gran Canaria&lt;/a&gt;. Pilkington spoke of Banks\u2019 death: \u201cThere was a piece on the news about how everyone was shocked\u201d.\nAn American singer-songwriter, &lt;a href=\"Aimee%20Mann\"&gt;Aimee Mann&lt;/a&gt;, became a close friend of Banks after meeting him in London in the early 1990s. The song \"You're With Stupid Now\" on her 1995 album \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20with%20Stupid%20%28album%29\"&gt;I'm with Stupid&lt;/a&gt;\" was inspired by their discussions of &lt;a href=\"British%20politics\"&gt;British politics&lt;/a&gt;."
