    "text": "Dual currency bonds are the &lt;a href=\"bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; for which money is raised in one &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt;, but redemption takes place in another. In a dual currency bond, the &lt;a href=\"Bond_%28finance%29%23Principal\"&gt;principal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coupon%20rate\"&gt;coupon rate&lt;/a&gt; denominated in two different currencies.\nHistory.\nLow &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate\"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt; during 1995 and 1996 led to a surge in issuance of dual currency bonds that was driven primarily by Japanese investors seeking income opportunities that were not available domestically. Dual currency bond were among the earliest and most successful &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt; linked &lt;a href=\"fixed%20income%20securities\"&gt;fixed income securities&lt;/a&gt; and remained popular thereafter. The securities were introduced on a private placement basis in the late 1980s, with Japanese insurers acting as &lt;a href=\"Financial%20capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; providers to United States and European issuers.\nFeatures.\nCoupon.\nThe coupon is the return the issuer pays to the &lt;a href=\"bondholder\"&gt;bondholder&lt;/a&gt;. For example, assume that the interest rate of Swiss Franc (CHF) currency is lower than United States Dollar (USD). Generally, the principal will be a higher interest rate currency (USD) and the coupon will be the lower interest rate currency (CHF).\nOption.\nThe bondholder may choose the higher &lt;a href=\"exchange%20rate\"&gt;exchange rate&lt;/a&gt; of the dual currency bond over the lower exchange rate currency bond.\nSwap.\nThe issuer and bondholder can switch positions. The bondholder compensates the issuer by reducing the cost of fund."
