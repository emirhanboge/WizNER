He had 31 years in the judiciary, starting as trial &lt;a href=\"judge\"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt; (20 YEARS): Judge, Court of First Instance (1966\u20131976) Basilan City and &lt;a href=\"Province\"&gt;Province&lt;/a&gt;; Judge, CFI of Cebu (1976\u20131979), Branches IX and XI; Judge, Circuit Criminal Court (1983\u20131986), Cebu City, Branch XVIII, Region 7.\nHermosisima Jr. was appointed by &lt;a href=\"Corazon%20Aquino\"&gt;Corazon Aquino&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt; Justice (9 years) (May 16, 1986 \u2013 July 18, 1995), and was promoted as an &lt;a href=\"Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Associate Justice&lt;/a&gt; on July 10, 1995, and retired on his 70th birthday on October 18, 1997. He is incumbent chair of the Board of Trustees, University of Cebu.

However, the Supreme Court nullified the proceedings, which it regarded as a \"sham\", and ordered a retrial of the cases before the Sandiganbayan (Galman vs. Sandiganbayan, 144 SCRA 43, 1986).\nIn his 177 pages decision dated September 28, 1990, Hermosisima Jr.'s &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt; found the said accused guilty as principals of the crime of murder in both Criminal Cases Nos. 10010 and 10011, and he sentenced them to reclusion perpetua in each case. The judgment became final after this Court denied petitioners\u2019 petition for review of the Sandiganbayan decision for failure to show reversible error in the questioned decision, as well as their subsequent motion for reconsideration. In August 2004, the said accused asked the High Tribunal to re-open the case, but the last appeal was denied.\nOn August 21, 2007, (Aquino's 24th death anniversary), Enrile stated that the case of the 14 soldiers incarcerated for 24 years now, due to the &lt;a href=\"assassination%20of%20Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.&lt;/a&gt; should be reviewed for clemency. Enrile paid for the legal services of the soldiers during their trial, and said the soldiers and their family have suffered enough. 15 soldiers of the Aviation Security Command were sentenced to double life imprisonment for the double murder of Aquino and scapegoat &lt;a href=\"Rolando%20Galman\"&gt;Rolando Galman&lt;/a&gt;, and one of them had died. They were all initially acquitted in December 1985, by the &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt;' Manuel Pamaran, but the &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt;'s Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. (promoted to Supreme Court Justice and incumbent 3 termer &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20and%20Bar%20Council\"&gt;Judicial and Bar Council&lt;/a&gt; regular member) convicted them on September 28, 1990.\nOn the 24th anniversary of the death of &lt;a href=\"Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;Benigno Aquino Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Cory stated that she had forgiven the 14 incarcerated soldiers for the assassination of her husband but she would not ever nod to appeals for their release. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Andres%20Narvasa\"&gt;Andres Narvasa&lt;/a&gt; stressed that there was no direct evidence linking &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fabian%20Ver\"&gt;Fabian Ver&lt;/a&gt; to the murder. Narvasa further pleaded for the release of the 14 soldiers since they have suffered enough, and warned that Mrs. Aquino is \"not a vengeful person\".\n2 guns that changed Philippine history.\nOn August 21, 2007, the 24th anniversary of Ninoy's murder, 2 guns which altered the course of Philippine history are rusting away in the drawers of the &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt;. The first is the charcoal-toned Smith &amp; Wesson .357 Magnum pistol, with a grip made of deer horn, was discovered near the body of &lt;a href=\"Rolando%20Galman\"&gt;Rolando Galman&lt;/a&gt;, and was marked \u201c\"Exhibit 32\". Its \"twin\" or the 2nd gun surfaced when the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 1986. This 2nd gun, which has the same serial number \u201cK919079\u201d as the first one was marked as \u201cExhibit 12,\u201d and really added to the mystery of Aquino's assassination. &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt; Associate Justice Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. in a 177-page decision promulgated in September 1990, incarcerated the 16 soldiers who were already acquitted by Manuel Pamaran's &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1990 judgment, the gun's owner was Col. Octavio Alvarez, who retired from the military on March 7, 1985.\nBoth the Agrava Board report and the Hermosisima Jr. court resolved that it was either a .45 cal. or a .38 cal. pistol that was used in killing Aquino, thereby dismissing Olivas\u2019 \"magnum theory\", which pointed to &lt;a href=\"Rolando%20Galman\"&gt;Rolando Galman&lt;/a&gt; as the killer and the weapon as the .357 Magnum pistol. The court maintained that it was Moreno who shot Aquino but that he used a different gun. But the real weapon and the masterminds are still unaccounted after 24 years. Meanwhile, the 2 mysterious Magnum revolvers will remain at the &lt;a href=\"Sandiganbayan\"&gt;Sandiganbayan&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s bodega until the return of Capt. Felipe Valerio, the group commander of the Avsecom 805th Special Operations Squadron, who might be the last key to Aquino's death.\nTimeline of Aquino-Galman murder.\nAug. 21, 1983 - &lt;a href=\"Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;Benigno Aquino Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated after disembarking a &lt;a href=\"China%20Airlines\"&gt;China Airlines&lt;/a&gt; plane at the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Manila International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Also killed was &lt;a href=\"Rolando%20Galman\"&gt;Rolando Galman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAug. 24, 1983 \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; set a fact-finding commission headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Fernando\"&gt;Enrique Fernando&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the Aquino murder (composed of 4 retired Supreme Court Justices who resigned, after its composition was challenged in court and thereafter, &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20M.%20Tolentino\"&gt;Arturo M.
