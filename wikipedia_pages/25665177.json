    "text": "Ian Hamilton (12 September 1940 \u2013 25 April 2021) was a professional footballer who played for &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt; in a thirteen-year career in &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHamilton was born in &lt;a href=\"Thornbury%2C%20South%20Gloucestershire\"&gt;Thornbury&lt;/a&gt; in 1940 and is the son of former Bristol Rovers player &lt;a href=\"John%20Hamilton%20%28footballer%20born%201902%29\"&gt;John Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, who made 63 League appearances for \"The Pirates\" between 1929 and 1931. He began playing as a child for Thornbury Town, another of his father's former teams, and initially joined Bristol Rovers as an amateur in 1956, a move which mirrored his older brother David who had also joined Rovers from Thornbury but died in a bungalow fire in &lt;a href=\"Olveston\"&gt;Olveston&lt;/a&gt; before making any League appearances.\nAfter two years as an amateur, Hamilton became a part-time professional in January 1958, aged 17, and made his first team debut in the &lt;a href=\"1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1958\u201359&lt;/a&gt; season. He made eleven League appearances in his first three seasons as a paid player before finally becoming fully professional in December 1961 at the age of 21. He was Bristol Rovers' top goalscorer during the &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1964\u201365&lt;/a&gt; season with twenty-one goals, and in all he played 149 League games for the club and scored 60 goals but became plagued by an ongoing knee problem later in his time in Bristol. He had a brief loan spell at &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1967\u201368&lt;/a&gt; season and spent a year with &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt; the following campaign, but his knee trouble forced him to retire from the professional game in 1969.\nHamilton returned to &lt;a href=\"non-League%20football\"&gt;non-League football&lt;/a&gt; in 1970, spending two years at &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; and a further two at &lt;a href=\"Welton%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Welton Rovers&lt;/a&gt; from 1972 until 1974, when he returned to Weston as assistant manager. His non-footballing career was spent as an airframe fitter with &lt;a href=\"Rolls-Royce%20Limited\"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patchway\"&gt;Patchway&lt;/a&gt;, from where he took early retirement in 1994.\nIn his later life Hamilton lived in &lt;a href=\"Rudgeway\"&gt;Rudgeway&lt;/a&gt; with his wife Betty and was a &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; fan. He has two children, Stephen and Sarah. Stephen, like his father, is an accomplished sportsman and played senior cricket for a number of clubs in the Bristol area. Ian was a member of &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Gloucestershire County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; and has travelled to see &lt;a href=\"England%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; play in locations including Australia, Barbados and South Africa."
