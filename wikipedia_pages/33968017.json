    "text": "The Enders SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation reaction is an &lt;a href=\"asymmetric%20synthesis\"&gt;asymmetric&lt;/a&gt; carbon-carbon &lt;a href=\"chemical%20bond\"&gt;bond&lt;/a&gt; formation reaction facilitated by &lt;a href=\"pyrrolidine\"&gt;pyrrolidine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chiral%20auxiliaries\"&gt;chiral auxiliaries&lt;/a&gt;. It was pioneered by &lt;a href=\"E.%20J.%20Corey\"&gt;E. J. Corey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dieter%20Enders\"&gt;D. Enders&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, and was further developed by &lt;a href=\"Dieter%20Enders\"&gt;D. Enders&lt;/a&gt; and his group. This method is usually a three-step sequence. The first step is to form the &lt;a href=\"hydrazone\"&gt;hydrazone&lt;/a&gt; between (\"S\")-1-amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP) or (\"R\")-1-amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (RAMP) and a &lt;a href=\"ketone\"&gt;ketone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"aldehyde\"&gt;aldehyde&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the hydrazone is &lt;a href=\"deprotonated\"&gt;deprotonated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"lithium%20diisopropylamide\"&gt;lithium diisopropylamide&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"lithium%20diisopropylamide\"&gt;LDA&lt;/a&gt;) to form an &lt;a href=\"enolate\"&gt;azaenolate&lt;/a&gt;, which reacts with &lt;a href=\"alkyl%20halides\"&gt;alkyl halides&lt;/a&gt; or other suitable &lt;a href=\"electrophiles\"&gt;electrophiles&lt;/a&gt; to give &lt;a href=\"alkylated\"&gt;alkylated&lt;/a&gt; hydrazone species with the simultaneous generation of a new &lt;a href=\"chiral%20center\"&gt;chiral center&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the alkylated ketone or aldehyde can be regenerated by &lt;a href=\"ozonolysis\"&gt;ozonolysis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hydrolysis\"&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis reaction is a useful technique for asymmetric \u03b1-alkylation of ketones and aldehydes, which are common synthetic intermediates for medicinally interesting &lt;a href=\"natural%20products\"&gt;natural products&lt;/a&gt; and other related &lt;a href=\"organic%20compounds\"&gt;organic compounds&lt;/a&gt;. These natural products include (-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B, the structural analog of &lt;a href=\"antimalarial\"&gt;antimalarial&lt;/a&gt; artemisinin, the polypropionate &lt;a href=\"metabolite\"&gt;metabolite&lt;/a&gt; (-)-denticulatin A and B isolated from \"&lt;a href=\"Siphonaria%20denticulata\"&gt;Siphonaria denticulata&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"zaragozic%20acid\"&gt;zaragozic acid&lt;/a&gt; A, a potent inhibitor of &lt;a href=\"sterol\"&gt;sterol&lt;/a&gt; synthesis, and &lt;a href=\"epothilone\"&gt;epothilone&lt;/a&gt; A and B, which have been proven to be very effective anticancer drugs.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Regioselective\"&gt;Regioselective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stereoselective\"&gt;stereoselective&lt;/a&gt; formation of carbon-carbon bonds adjacent to &lt;a href=\"carbonyl\"&gt;carbonyl&lt;/a&gt; group is an important procedure in organic chemistry. Alkylation reaction of enolates has been the main focus of the field. Both A. G. Myers and &lt;a href=\"David%20A.%20Evans\"&gt;D. A. Evans&lt;/a&gt; developed asymmetric alkylation reactions for enolates.\nThe apparent shortcoming for enolate alkylation reactions is over-alkylation, even if the amount of base added for enolization as well as the reaction temperature are carefully controlled. The ketene formation during the deprotonation process for substrates possessing Evans' oxazolidinone is also a main side reaction for the related alkylation reactions. Development in the field of &lt;a href=\"enamine\"&gt;enamine&lt;/a&gt; chemistry and the utilization of &lt;a href=\"imine\"&gt;imine&lt;/a&gt; derivatives of enolates managed to provide an alternative for enolate alkylation reactions.\nIn 1963, &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Stork\"&gt;G. Stork&lt;/a&gt; reported the first enamine alkylation reaction for ketones - &lt;a href=\"Stork%20enamine%20alkylation\"&gt;Stork enamine alkylation&lt;/a&gt; reaction.\nIn 1976, Meyers reported the first alkylation reaction of metallated azaenolates of &lt;a href=\"hydrazones\"&gt;hydrazones&lt;/a&gt; with an acyclic &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;-based auxiliary. Compared with the free carbonyl compounds and the chiral enamine species reported previously, the hydrazones exhibit higher reactivity, &lt;a href=\"regioselectivity\"&gt;regioselectivity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stereoselectivity\"&gt;stereoselectivity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe combination of cyclic amino acid derivatives (SAMP and RAMP) and the powerful hydrazone techniques were pioneered by E. J. Corey and D. Enders in 1976, and were independently developed by D. Enders later. Both SAMP and RAMP are synthesized from amino acids. The detailed synthesis of these two auxiliaries are shown below.\nMechanism.\nThe Enders SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation begins with the synthesis of the hydrazone from a N,N-dialkylhydrazine and a ketone or aldehyde\nThe hydrazone is then deprotonated on the \u03b1-carbon position by a strong base, such as &lt;a href=\"lithium%20diisopropylamide\"&gt;lithium diisopropylamide&lt;/a&gt; (LDA), leading to the formation of a &lt;a href=\"resonance\"&gt;resonance&lt;/a&gt; stabilized &lt;a href=\"anion\"&gt;anion&lt;/a&gt; - an azaenolate. This anion is a very good &lt;a href=\"nucleophile\"&gt;nucleophile&lt;/a&gt; and readily attacks &lt;a href=\"electrophiles\"&gt;electrophiles&lt;/a&gt;, such as alkyl halides, to generate alkylated hydrazones with simultaneous creation of a new &lt;a href=\"chiral\"&gt;chiral&lt;/a&gt; center at the \u03b1-carbon.\nThe stereochemistry of this reaction is discussed in detail in next section.\nStereochemistry.\nStereochemistry of the azaenolate.\nAfter the deprotonation, the imine turns into an azaenolate with lithium cation chelating both the nitrogen and oxygen. There are two possible options for lithium chelation. One is that lithium is &lt;a href=\"antiperiplanar\"&gt;antiperiplanar&lt;/a&gt; to the C=C bond (blue colored), leading to the conformation of \"Z\"C-N; the other one is that lithium and the C=C bond are at the same side of the C-N bond (red colored), leading to the \"E\"C-N conformer. There are also two available orientations for the chelating nitrogen and R2 group, being either \"E\"C=C or \"Z\"C=C. This leads to four possible azaenolate intermediates (A, B, C and D) for the Enders' SAMP/RAMP hydrazone alkylation reaction.\nExperiments and calculations show that one specific &lt;a href=\"stereoisomer\"&gt;stereoisomer&lt;/a&gt; of the azaenolate is favored over the other three possible candidates. Therefore, although four isomers are possible for the azaenolate, only the one (azaenolate A) with the stereochemistry of its C=C double bonds being E and that of its C-N bond being Z stereochemistry is dominant (EC=CZC-N) for both cyclic and acyclic ketones.\nStereochemistry of alkylation.\nThe favored azaenolate is the dominant starting molecule for the subsequent alkylation reaction. There are two possible faces of accessing for any electrophile to react with. The steric interaction between the pyrrolidine ring and the electrophilic reagent hinders the attack of the electrophile from the top face. On the contrary, when the electrophile attacks from the bottom face, such unfavorable interaction does not exist. Therefore, the electrophilic attack proceeds from the sterically more accessible face.\nVariants.\nThe chelation of &lt;a href=\"lithium\"&gt;lithium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cation\"&gt;cation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"methoxy\"&gt;methoxy&lt;/a&gt; group is one of the most important features of the transition state for Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction. It is necessary to have this chelation effect to achieve high &lt;a href=\"stereoselectivity\"&gt;stereoselectivity&lt;/a&gt;. The development and modification of Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction mainly focus on the addition of more steric hindrance on the pyrrolidine rings of both SAMP and RAMP, while preserving the methoxy group for lithium &lt;a href=\"chelation\"&gt;chelation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most famous four variants of SAMP and RAMP are SADP, SAEP, SAPP and RAMBO, whose structures are shown below.\nIn 2011, several N-amino cyclic &lt;a href=\"carbamates\"&gt;carbamates&lt;/a&gt; were synthesized and studied for asymmetric hydrazone alkylation reactions. Both the stereochemistry and regioselectivity of the reactions turned out to be very promising. These new compounds consist of a new class of chiral auxiliary based on the carbamate structure and, therefore, no longer belong to the family of SAMP and RAMP. But they do provide very powerful alternatives to the traditional pyrrolidine systems.\nScope.\nHydrazones are usually very stable toward &lt;a href=\"hydrolysis\"&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"solvolysis\"&gt;solvolysis&lt;/a&gt; conditions, suggesting that they require rather vigorous reaction conditions to be ripped off from the products. So far, three kinds of methods for cleaving the hydrazones have been reported. Oxidative cleavage is the most frequently used method due to its high yields, but most &lt;a href=\"oxidants\"&gt;oxidants&lt;/a&gt; incorporated would also react with the &lt;a href=\"alkene\"&gt;olefinic&lt;/a&gt; moieties and other oxidizable &lt;a href=\"functional%20groups\"&gt;functional groups&lt;/a&gt;. The oxidants most used are &lt;a href=\"ozone\"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sodium%20periodate\"&gt;sodium periodate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mCPBA\"&gt;mCPBA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"peracetic%20acid\"&gt;peracetic acid&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them are capable of cleavaging electron-rich olefins and inducing &lt;a href=\"Baeyer-Villiger%20oxidation\"&gt;Baeyer-Villiger oxidation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough hydrolytic cleavage is the mildest method, usually the low yields for relatively complicated substrates is a big problem. The reagents that are frequently used are &lt;a href=\"methyl%20iodide\"&gt;methyl iodide&lt;/a&gt; with aqueous &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20chloride\"&gt;hydrogen chloride&lt;/a&gt;, cupric salts, and other &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases\"&gt;Lewis acids&lt;/a&gt;. Reductive cleavage is only restricted to a handful of special substrates, such as &lt;a href=\"ferrocene\"&gt;ferrocene&lt;/a&gt; based hydrazones.\nFor those carbamate-based hydrazones, the cleavage is much easier, possibly due to the decreased electron density caused by the carbonyl group adjacent to one of the two nitrogens. With para-tosylate acid added, the hydrazone compounds can be transformed to the corresponding ketones with almost quantitative yields.\nConditions.\nEnder's hydrazone alkylation reaction is usually run through a sequence of three steps. The first step should always be the synthesis of the hydrazones. The ketone or aldehyde is mixed with either SAMP or RAMP and allowed to react under &lt;a href=\"argon\"&gt;argon&lt;/a&gt; for 12 hours. The crude hydrazone obtained is purified by &lt;a href=\"distillation\"&gt;distillation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"recrystallization%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;recrystallization&lt;/a&gt;. At 0 degree &lt;a href=\"celsius\"&gt;celsius&lt;/a&gt;, the hydrazone is transferred into the &lt;a href=\"diethyl%20ether\"&gt;ether&lt;/a&gt; solution of lithium diisopropylamide. Then this mixture is cooled down to -110 degree celsius and is slowly added the alkyl halide. This mixture is then allowed to warm up to room temperature. After 12 hours of reaction at room temperature, the crude alkylated hydrazone is allowed to react with ozone in a &lt;a href=\"Schlenk%20tube\"&gt;Schlenk tube&lt;/a&gt; to cleave the C=N bond. After distillation or &lt;a href=\"column%20chromatography\"&gt;column chromatography&lt;/a&gt;, pure alkylation product can be obtained.\nApplications.\nSynthesis of zaragozic acid A.\n&lt;a href=\"K.%20C.%20Nicolaou\"&gt;K. C. Nicolaou&lt;/a&gt; and coworkers at &lt;a href=\"Scripps%20Research%20Institute\"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; generated the chiral hydrazone through Enders' hydrazone alkylation reaction with high stereoselectivity (\"de\" &gt; 95%). The subsequent ozonolysis and &lt;a href=\"Wittig%20reaction\"&gt;Wittig reaction&lt;/a&gt; led to the side chain fragment of zaragozic acid A, which is a potent medicine for coronary heart disease.\nSynthesis of denticulatin A and B.\nZiegler and coworkers reacted an &lt;a href=\"allyl\"&gt;allyl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"iodide\"&gt;iodide&lt;/a&gt; with the azaenolate to generate a chiral hydrocarbon chain. To avoid loss of the enantiomeric purity of the product, the authors used &lt;a href=\"cupric%20acetate\"&gt;cupric acetate&lt;/a&gt; to regenerate the carbonyl group, obtaining only moderate yield for the cleavage of C=N bond but good enantioselectivity (\"ee\" = 89%). The ketone was transformed after several steps into denticulatin A and B - polypropionate metabolites isolated from \"Siphonaria Denticulata\".\nSynthesis of the derivative of arteannuin.\n(-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B is a structural analog of the &lt;a href=\"antimalarial\"&gt;antimalarial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"artemisinin\"&gt;artemisinin&lt;/a&gt;. It exhibits potent antimalarial activity even against a drug-resistant strain. Little and coworkers obtained the alkylated hydrazone in diastereomerically pure form (\"de\" &gt; 95%) through the Enders' alkylation reaction. This intermediate was then elaborated into (-)-C10-demethyl arteannuin B.\nSynthesis of epothilone A.\n&lt;a href=\"Epothilone\"&gt;Epothilone&lt;/a&gt; A and B are reported to be highly effective anticancer drugs. Several of their structural derivatives show very promising inhibition against breast cancer with only mild side effect and some of them are now under trials. In 1997, K. C. Nicolaou and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of both Epothilone A and B. Ender's alkylation reaction was utilized at the very beginning of the synthesis to install the stereogenic center at C8. The reaction proceeded with both high yield and high diastereoselectivity."
