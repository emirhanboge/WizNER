They are the best of friends, although Nisha is secretly in love with Rahul. Rahul announces his desire to direct a musical named \"Maya\". The members of the troupe, including Nisha, have their doubts about the title character, \"Maya\", who Rahul describes as a girl who believes in true love and waiting for her prince charming who will surely turn up and take her away. Meanwhile, Pooja is introduced, an amazing dancer, classically trained as well, and passionate about dancing. Having been orphaned at a young age, she has been raised by close friends of her parents.\nPooja and Rahul have a string of near-misses as they run into each other time and again. Each of these instances is marked by a tune playing in the background, that registers with Pooja. During rehearsals for the play, Nisha injures her leg and the doctor says she cannot dance for a few months. Rahul needs a new woman to play the lead role in the play. He comes across Pooja dancing one day and believes she is perfect for the role. He begs her to come to their rehearsals and she agrees. Rahul and Pooja become close friends. Doted upon by her foster family, Pooja is soon taken to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; by her guardian's son Ajay, her childhood best friend who has been in London for months. Just as Ajay leaves to fly to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, he proposes to Pooja. In a dilemma, she ends up accepting it.\nNisha soon returns from the hospital and is upset that she has been replaced. Upon learning that Rahul loves Pooja, she becomes very jealous of her. Knowing that Rahul does not reciprocate her love, she decides to leave for London. Throughout rehearsals, Rahul and Pooja find themselves falling for one another. When Rahul drops Pooja home one day, he starts whistling his tune, making Pooja realize that she has fallen for the man with the tune she so often heard. The next day, the two go to meet Pooja's old dance tutor, who Pooja addresses as Tai, who figures that the two are blatantly in love. At the wedding of two members of the dance troupe, Rahul and Pooja share an intimate moment but are unsure how to fully express their love.\nA few days before the premiere, Ajay arrives at the rehearsal hall to surprise Pooja while telling everyone that he is her fianc\u00e9. Rahul is heartbroken but tries not to show it. Nisha, who has returned, notices Rahul's devastation and explains how she too was devastated when he did not love her in return. Rahul edits the end of the play to reflect his heartbreak, in contrast to his usual style of always giving a happy ending. On the night of the premiere, as Rahul and Pooja's characters are about to break up on stage, Ajay plays a recorded tape Pooja was going to send him before his proposal where she described how she felt about Rahul. Ajay is indirectly telling Pooja that she and Rahul are meant to be together. Pooja now realizes she truly loves Rahul and the two confess their love on stage as the audience applauds them, giving the play a happy ending once again. Also, backstage, Ajay ends up asking Nisha whether she is already married or not (implying him getting interested in her).\nProduction.\n\"Dil To Pagal Hai\" was the second of &lt;a href=\"Yash%20Chopra\"&gt;Chopra's&lt;/a&gt; 4 consecutive films to star &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Rukh%20Khan\"&gt;Shah Rukh Khan&lt;/a&gt; in the lead role. It was the third film to feature &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Rukh%20Khan\"&gt;Shah Rukh Khan&lt;/a&gt; opposite &lt;a href=\"Madhuri%20Dixit\"&gt;Madhuri Dixit&lt;/a&gt;. The film was originally titled \"Maine To Mohabbat Kar Li\" and \"Tevar\" before Yash Chopra finally settled on \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" as the title.\n&lt;a href=\"Sridevi\"&gt;Sridevi&lt;/a&gt; was initially offered to play the part of Pooja but she refused it. The role then went to Dixit. After casting Dixit in the lead role of Pooja, Chopra found it hard to cast the role of Nisha, which was eventually essayed by Kapoor. The role had been earlier offered to &lt;a href=\"Manisha%20Koirala\"&gt;Manisha Koirala&lt;/a&gt;, who refused the role. Chopra then offered it to &lt;a href=\"Juhi%20Chawla\"&gt;Juhi Chawla&lt;/a&gt;, as Chopra wanted the 2 leading actresses of that time to appear together on screen. But Chawla did not want to play second-fiddle to Dixit, especially after playing the leading-lady in Chopra's \"&lt;a href=\"Darr\"&gt;Darr&lt;/a&gt;\" (1993). &lt;a href=\"Kajol\"&gt;Kajol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raveena%20Tandon\"&gt;Raveena Tandon&lt;/a&gt; were next offered the role; however, Kajol deemed the role insubstantial, while Raveena Tandon was considering quitting her career at the time. The role was also offered to &lt;a href=\"Urmila%20Matondkar\"&gt;Urmila Matondkar&lt;/a&gt; who accepted, but left the film after a day of shooting. No leading-lady of that time was willing to take the risk of playing the second lead to Dixit. Chopra finally approached Kapoor with the film and she agreed to take up the challenge and was finally signed for the role. She felt that despite the short screen-time, a lot could be achieved with her role.\nIn addition to writing the story, Chopra co-produced the film along with M. Vakil under the banner Yash Raj Films. The script was written by Chopra, his son Aditya and wife Pamela. The film's costumes were handled together by &lt;a href=\"Manish%20Malhotra\"&gt;Manish Malhotra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karan%20Johar\"&gt;Karan Johar&lt;/a&gt; and Salman. Manmohan Singh was the cinematographer. The choreography was handled by Farah Khan and Shiamak Davar. This was one of &lt;a href=\"Shahid%20Kapoor\"&gt;Shahid Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;'s first appearances on film. He was a background dancer in the song \"Le Gayi\".\nChopra rejected 54 dresses created by Manish Malhotra for Dixit's character, choosing a \"&lt;a href=\"salwar%20kameez\"&gt;salwar kameez&lt;/a&gt;\" over others. Filming began in June 1996. It was the first &lt;a href=\"Bollywood\"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; film to be shot in &lt;a href=\"Baden-Baden\"&gt;Baden-Baden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Europa%20Park\"&gt;Europa Park&lt;/a&gt;, both German tourist attractions. It was made on a budget of 90 million.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack of \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" includes 10 songs. The songs for the film were composed by &lt;a href=\"Uttam%20Singh\"&gt;Uttam Singh&lt;/a&gt;. Lyrics were written by &lt;a href=\"Anand%20Bakshi\"&gt;Anand Bakshi&lt;/a&gt;. The music was a major hit among the audience, with the album becoming the best-selling &lt;a href=\"Bollywood%20soundtrack\"&gt;Bollywood soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; of the year, with 12.5million &lt;a href=\"soundtrack%20album\"&gt;soundtrack album&lt;/a&gt; sales.
