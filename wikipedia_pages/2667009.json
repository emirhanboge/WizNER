    "text": "Rajaram Bhosle I (14 February 1670 \u2013 3 March 1700) was the third \"&lt;a href=\"Chhatrapati\"&gt;Chhatrapati&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Maratha%20Empire\"&gt;Maratha Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from 1689 to his death in 1700. He was the second son of the &lt;a href=\"Shivaji\"&gt;Shivaji&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the empire and younger half-brother of &lt;a href=\"Sambhaji\"&gt;Sambhaji&lt;/a&gt;, who he succeeded. His eleven-year reign was marked with a constant struggle against the Mughals. He was succeeded by his infant son &lt;a href=\"Shivaji%20II\"&gt;Shivaji II&lt;/a&gt; under the regentship of his widow &lt;a href=\"Tarabai\"&gt;Tarabai&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and family.\nRajaram was born in a family of &lt;a href=\"Bhonsle\"&gt;Bhonsle&lt;/a&gt; clan, to &lt;a href=\"Shivaji\"&gt;Shivaji&lt;/a&gt; and his younger wife, &lt;a href=\"Soyarabai\"&gt;Soyarabai&lt;/a&gt; on 14 February 1670. He was thirteen years younger than his brother, &lt;a href=\"Sambhaji\"&gt;Sambhaji&lt;/a&gt;. Given the ambitious nature of Soyarabai, Rajaram was installed on the Maratha throne upon the death of his father in 1680. However, the Maratha generals wanted Sambhaji as the king and thus, he claimed the throne. Upon Sambhaji's death, Rajaram was crowned as Chhatrapati of the Maratha state.\nRajaram married three times. His first marriage was at the age of ten to &lt;a href=\"Jankibai\"&gt;Jankibai&lt;/a&gt;, the five-year-old daughter of Shivaji's army chief, &lt;a href=\"Prataprao%20Gujar\"&gt;Prataprao Gujar&lt;/a&gt;. His other wives were &lt;a href=\"Tarabai\"&gt;Tarabai&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Hambirrao%20Mohite\"&gt;Hambirrao Mohite&lt;/a&gt;, the army chief who succeeded Prataprao, and Rajasbai from the influential Ghatge family of &lt;a href=\"Kagal\"&gt;Kagal&lt;/a&gt;. Rajaram had three sons,\nCoronation and attack by the Mughals.\nAfter the death of Sambhaji, Rajaram was crowned at Raigad on 12 March 1689. As the Mughals started laying siege to the region around &lt;a href=\"Raigad%20fort\"&gt;Raigad&lt;/a&gt; on 25 March 1689, the widow of Sambhaji (Maharani Yesubai) and her minister &lt;a href=\"Ramchandra%20Pant%20Amatya\"&gt;Ramchandra Pant Amatya&lt;/a&gt; sent young Rajaram to the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Pratapgad\"&gt;Pratapgad&lt;/a&gt; through Kavlya ghat. The Maratha army fought with the Mughals and led the new Maratha king, Rajaram to escape through Kavlya ghat to the fort of &lt;a href=\"Gingee\"&gt;Jinji&lt;/a&gt; in present-day state of &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; via Pratapgad and Vishalgad forts, Rajaram reached Keladi (Near present-day Sagar in Karnataka) in disguise and pursued assistance from &lt;a href=\"Keladi%20Chennamma\"&gt;Keladi Chennamma&lt;/a&gt; - who kept the Mughal attack in check to ensure safe passage and escape of Rajaram to Jinji where he reached after a month and a half on 1 November 1689. Details of his escape are known from the incomplete poetical biography of Rajaram, the \"Rajaramacharita\" written by his &lt;a href=\"Rajpurohit\"&gt;Rajpurohit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keshav%20Pandit\"&gt;Keshav Pandit&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Jinji.\n&lt;a href=\"Aurangzeb\"&gt;Aurangzeb&lt;/a&gt; deputed &lt;a href=\"Ghazi%20ud-Din%20Khan%20Feroze%20Jung%20I\"&gt;Ghazi-ud-din Firoze Jung&lt;/a&gt; against the Marathas in the &lt;a href=\"Deccan%20Plateau\"&gt;Deccan&lt;/a&gt;, and specially sent &lt;a href=\"Zulfiqar%20Khan%20Nusrat%20Jung\"&gt;Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung&lt;/a&gt; to capture the &lt;a href=\"Gingee%20Fort\"&gt;Jingi Fort&lt;/a&gt;. He laid siege to it in September, 1690. After three failed attempts, it was finally captured after seven years on 8 January 1698. Rajaram, however, escaped and fled first to &lt;a href=\"Vellore\"&gt;Vellore&lt;/a&gt; and later to Vishalgad.\nSantaji and Dhanaji.\nRajaram occupied the fort at Jinji from 11 November 1689, but left before it fell in 1698, setting up his court at fort &lt;a href=\"Satara%20%28city%29\"&gt;Satara&lt;/a&gt;. During that period when Jinji remained unconquered, \"the intrepid Maratha commanders, &lt;a href=\"Santaji%20Ghorpade\"&gt;Santaji Ghorpade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dhanaji%20Jadhav\"&gt;Dhanaji Jadhav&lt;/a&gt;, wrought havoc in the Karnataka and Maharashtra by defeating the Mughal generals and cutting off their lines of communication.\"\nDeath.\nRajaram died of lung disease in 1700 at &lt;a href=\"Sinhagad\"&gt;Sinhagad&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Pune\"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; leaving behind widows and infants. Janakibai, one of his widows, committed &lt;a href=\"Sati%20%28practice%29\"&gt;Sati&lt;/a&gt; upon Rajaram's death. Another of Rajaram's widows, &lt;a href=\"Tarabai\"&gt;Tarabai&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed her young son, Shivaji II as the Chhatrapati and ruled as his regent. However, the release of &lt;a href=\"Shahu%20I\"&gt;Shahu&lt;/a&gt;, by the successors of Aurangzeb led to an internecine conflict between Tarabai and Shahu with the latter becoming the winner and occupant of the throne. Tarabai established a separate seat at Kolhapur and installed her son as the rival Chhatrapati. She was shortly deposed by Rajasbai, the other surviving widow of Rajaram. Rajasbai installed the other son of Rajaram called &lt;a href=\"Sambhaji%20II\"&gt;Sambhaji II&lt;/a&gt; on the Kolhapur throne. The &lt;a href=\"Kolhapur%20State\"&gt;Kolhapur line&lt;/a&gt; has continued to this day through natural succession and adoptions per Hindu custom."
