    "text": "The M198 is a medium-sized, towed &lt;a href=\"155%20mm\"&gt;155 mm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; piece, developed for service with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;. It was commissioned to be a replacement for the WWII-era &lt;a href=\"M114%20155%20mm%20howitzer\"&gt;M114 155 mm howitzer&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed and prototyped at the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Island%20Arsenal\"&gt;Rock Island Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in 1969 with firing tests beginning in 1970 and went into full production there in 1978. It entered service in 1979 and since then 1,600 units have been produced and put into operation.\nThe M198 is being replaced in US and Australian service by the &lt;a href=\"M777%20howitzer\"&gt;M777 howitzer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe M198 155\u00a0mm &lt;a href=\"howitzer\"&gt;howitzer&lt;/a&gt; weighs less than , allowing it to be dropped by &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; or transported by a &lt;a href=\"CH-53E%20Super%20Stallion\"&gt;CH-53E Super Stallion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"CH-47%20Chinook\"&gt;CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt;. The M198 is a towed howitzer that is transported tail first. The gun tube can be rotated over the howitzer's trail legs to reduce its length, though this requires removal of the &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20brake\"&gt;muzzle brake&lt;/a&gt;, or left in the firing position for faster deployment. When firing, the weapon is lowered onto its baseplate rather than being anchored to the ground, allowing for rapid emplacement. The breech is operated manually via a screw type mechanism that rests low in an ergonomic position.\nThe M198 fires separate-loading (non-fixed) ammunition and can be loaded with a variety of propellants and projectiles. The effective range is 18,100 meters when firing standard projectiles, which increases to 30,000 meters when firing rocket-assisted projectiles and guided ammunition. With the 52-caliber modification the range can surpass 40,000 meters. The weapon system requires a crew of 9 and is capable of firing at a maximum rate of four rounds per minute, two sustained.\nThe M198 is deployed in separate &lt;a href=\"corps\"&gt;corps&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=\"Military%20organization%23Hierarchy%20of%20modern%20armies\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;-level field artillery units, as well as in artillery &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"light%20infantry\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"airborne%20forces\"&gt;airborne&lt;/a&gt; divisions. It also provided field artillery fire support for all &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Air-Ground%20Task%20Force\"&gt;Marine Air-Ground Task Force&lt;/a&gt; organizations until the adoption of the M777 howitzer.\nReplacement.\n&lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; won the contract to replace the M198 in the US Army and Marine Corps with its &lt;a href=\"M777\"&gt;M777&lt;/a&gt; 155\u00a0mm/39 cal towed howitzer, which weighs less than . It was introduced in 2005."
