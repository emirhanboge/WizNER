More than 200 specialists from 30 different countries participated in this event.\nThe 2nd Gut Microbiota for Health World Summit was held in Madrid, Spain, a year later.\nThe 3rd Gut Microbiota for Health World Summit took place in &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, United States, in 2014. Among the topics covered: In what way does gut microbiota influence &lt;a href=\"functional%20bowel%20disorder\"&gt;functional bowel disorder&lt;/a&gt;s? How is gut microbiota involved in the development of the &lt;a href=\"metabolic%20syndrome\"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;? Can &lt;a href=\"diet%20%28nutrition%29\"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probiotics\"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; have a positive effect on &lt;a href=\"mental%20health\"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;?.\nThe 4th summit was held in Barcelona, Spain. Since 2015, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition joined the summit as co-partners.\nThe 5th Gut Microbiota for Health World Summit took place in Miami, Florida, in 2016. During this event, scientists discussed topics ranging from diet switch impact on gut microbiota, to pre and probiotics, including fecal microbiota transplantations...\nOther activities.\nThe Gut Microbiota &amp; Health Section publishes scientific papers on gut flora. Its first paper was published in the \"Neurogastroenterology and Motility\" journal in 2013. Its theme was: \"Gut microbiota and gastrointestinal health: current concepts and future directions\"."
