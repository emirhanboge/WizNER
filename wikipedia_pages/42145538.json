An official inquiry concluded he had shot himself two times at the end of a police chase, one bullet scratching his skin and the other into the heart (this one proved to be fatal).\nAccording to Ukrainian MP Oles Doniy, a group of unknown armed people arrived in three Volkswagen minivans and kidnapped Muzychko and five other people from a caf\u00e9 near &lt;a href=\"Rivne\"&gt;Rivne&lt;/a&gt;. They murdered Muzychko behind the caf\u00e9 with two gunshots to the heart. In another telling of Doniy's account, a group of attackers forced Muzychko to halt his car, pulled him out of the vehicle, handcuffed him and shot him.\nAccording to the interior ministry of Ukraine, Muzychko died in a shoot-out with police in a caf\u00e9 in Rivne. According to the ministry, the police raided the caf\u00e9 to arrest Muzychko, but he opened fire while he tried to flee. He was shot when the police returned fire. The police were able to capture him and three others, but by the time the paramedics had arrived at the scene, he had died.\nOn 25 March, police stated that Muzychko had shot himself. This was confirmed by an inquiry by the interior ministry, who concluded he had shot himself in the heart as police tried to bring him to the ground after a chase. The inquiry also concluded he had fired previously, resulting in a scratch on his skin, and that the police had acted lawfully.\nReacting to the news about shooting Dmytro Yarosh leader of Right Sector, called for resignation of Interior Minister &lt;a href=\"Arsen%20Avakov\"&gt;Arsen Avakov&lt;/a&gt; and the arrest of the police officers who came after Muzychko.
