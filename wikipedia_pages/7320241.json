He is a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20University\"&gt;Meiji University&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied theater literature in the department of literature; originally, he had considered wanting to make &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;s as a movie director, when he also had an interest in the field of performing. At the En \u2022 Theater Research Institute, he took and passed a non-degree course, being enthusiastic about theater work.\nAfter his graduation from a trading school, Tsuda had belonged to a &lt;a href=\"Stage%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt; group office. In so doing, there was talk of &lt;a href=\"audition\"&gt;audition&lt;/a&gt;s, and Tsuda made his debut in voice acting as Atsushi Noda in the 1995 animated television series \"&lt;a href=\"H2%20%28manga%29\"&gt;H2&lt;/a&gt;.\" Since then, Tsuda's work has centered around voice acting, as he's worked in theater, &lt;a href=\"television%20dramas\"&gt;television dramas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"movie\"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; appearances, among others; furthermore, he has been active at many levels, including as a &lt;a href=\"Narration\"&gt;narrator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"radio%20personality\"&gt;radio personality&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Television%20show\"&gt;television programs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Television%20advertisement\"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt;, and the like.\nTsuda likes both filming and watching movies. He began attending movie theaters in junior high; though he had watched old Western movies until senior high and focused on artistic films after entering college, fundamentally his interest lies, evidently, in non-genres.\nIn 2017, when &lt;a href=\"Keiji%20Fujiwara\"&gt;Keiji Fujiwara&lt;/a&gt; was recovering from illness, Tsuda took charge as a substitute actor for a few roles (those of Isami Enomoto in \",\" Hannes in \"&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Titan%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/a&gt;\").\nOn February 2, 2019, Tsuda debuted as a film director with his release of \"Documentertainment AD-LIVE\" (the term being a &lt;a href=\"portmanteau\"&gt;portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; of \"documentary\" and \"entertainment\").\nOn November 24, 2020, \"Actor's Short Film\" \u2014 a project launched by &lt;a href=\"Wowow\"&gt;WOWOW&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate the station's 30th year since its opening: Five actors (facing the same conditions, such as budget and time) would individually direct short films up to 25 minutes long each; one of those five films will be chosen, based on the votes of viewers and film critics, to be presented at the Short Shorts Film Festival &amp; Asia held in 2021 \u2014 was announced on Twitter; Tsuda took part with his own short film, \"GET SET GO,\" which cast actors &lt;a href=\"Ryo%20Ryusei\"&gt;Ryou Ryuusei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shunsuke%20Dait%C5%8D\"&gt;Shunsuke Daitou&lt;/a&gt;. As the film's director and screenwriter, Tsuda also made an appearance in the film as an actor. On January 13, 2021, distribution of these five films began.\nEpisode.\nTsuda revealed on his Twitter that he has been called \"Kenbou\" (literally, \"Ken Sonny,\" which is actually a &lt;a href=\"Hypocorism\"&gt;pet form&lt;/a&gt; based on his given name's meaning, \"Healthy Second Son\") by, among others, game designer &lt;a href=\"Hideo%20Kojima\"&gt;Hideo Kojima&lt;/a&gt; and voice actor &lt;a href=\"Akio%20%C5%8Ctsuka\"&gt;Akio \u014ctsuka&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 working for the general manager \u2014 at the recording location of the game \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20Stranding\"&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/a&gt;.\" Several days later, in the form of a reply Tweeted to Tsuda, voice actor &lt;a href=\"Akihiko%20Ishizumi\"&gt;Akihiko Ishizumi&lt;/a&gt;, who had been with the actor at the same game recording location, wrote \"Kenbou.\"\nPrivate life.\nTsuda married a woman he encountered around when he was starting out as a stage actor (she is not a celebrity, as Tsuda mentioned it in his &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; announcement), and currently is the father of two children. By not officially announcing his marriage, Tsuda thought, he could protect his family's safety; another reason for this approach is the large appeal that Tsuda's favorite actors have carried as figures who have not displayed their private lives \u2014 he, too, had thoughts of wanting to become an expressive person like that, so he hadn't made his getting married public. However, in July 2020, he received notice that a news story about his marriage had been published in one section of a weekly magazine (&lt;a href=\"Sh%C5%ABkanshi\"&gt;Sh\u016bkanshi&lt;/a&gt;) and decided to bring these facts to light via his Instagram.\nAppearances.\nBoldface indicates main characters."
