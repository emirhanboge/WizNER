It was also the final feature film of director &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Enright\"&gt;Ray Enright&lt;/a&gt; and the American film debut of &lt;a href=\"Irene%20Papas\"&gt;Irene Papas&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nThe French government investigates the location of some bullion stolen during the war.\nTourist Mike Canelli, an ex-serviceman who served in Algeria during the war, is mistaken for an American agent assisting the French.\nProduction.\nThe film was produced by Bernard Luber, who had just made \"&lt;a href=\"Loan%20Shark%20%28film%29\"&gt;Loan Shark&lt;/a&gt;\" with Raft. It was shot on location in Algeria and Italy and was made for $155,000, with $80,000 in deferrals.\nReception.\nIn a contemporary review for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", critic &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Thompson%20%28film%20critic%29\"&gt;Howard Thompson&lt;/a&gt; found the film to be formulaic but with \"a sleazy, authentic-looking backdrop.\" Thompson wrote: \"Lethargically directed by Ray H. Enright, the action soon levels off to a dull, unsurprising trot. ... Mr. Raft is Mr. Raft, still the same competent, brisk and unimaginative performer. ... [T]he rest go through their assigned motions. It takes all of them a long time.\""
