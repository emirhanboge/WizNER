    "text": "Montrose Roselea Football Club are a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the town of &lt;a href=\"Montrose%2C%20Angus\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"angus%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Angus&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 1930 and nicknamed \"the Lea\", their colours are green with a black and white trim.\nThey were members of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Scottish Junior Football Association&lt;/a&gt;'s Angus League and &lt;a href=\"Tayside%20Junior%20Football%20League\"&gt;Tayside Region League&lt;/a&gt;, before competing in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association%2C%20East%20Region\"&gt;new East Region&lt;/a&gt; which they, along with all other Tayside Junior clubs became a part in 2002. Playing second fiddle to the senior &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, success has been sparse during their years of existence however in recent years the success has been beyond a club of its size.\nThe club applied to move from the SJFA East Region to join the &lt;a href=\"SJFA%20North%20Region\"&gt;North Region&lt;/a&gt;, and this was accepted for the beginning of season &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoselea traditionally play their home games at Broomfield Park, a relatively undeveloped facility in the north of the town which has room for around 1,800 spectators. For the 2018\u201319 season, they have reached an agreement to share Montrose F.C.'s &lt;a href=\"Links%20Park\"&gt;Links Park&lt;/a&gt; stadium, with a view towards a longer-term arrangement."
