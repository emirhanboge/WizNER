    "text": "Harshavardhana (c. 590\u2013647 CE) was an Indian emperor who ruled &lt;a href=\"North%20India\"&gt;North India&lt;/a&gt; from 606 to 647 CE. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Vardhana%20dynasty\"&gt;Vardhana dynasty&lt;/a&gt;; and was the son of &lt;a href=\"Prabhakaravardhana\"&gt;Prabhakaravardhana&lt;/a&gt; who defeated the &lt;a href=\"Alchon%20Huns\"&gt;Alchon Huna&lt;/a&gt; invaders, and the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Rajyavardhana\"&gt;Rajyavardhana&lt;/a&gt;, a king of &lt;a href=\"Thanesar\"&gt;Thanesar&lt;/a&gt;, present-day Haryana.\nAt the height of Harsha's power, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, with the &lt;a href=\"Narmada%20River\"&gt;Narmada River&lt;/a&gt; as its southern boundary. He eventually made &lt;a href=\"Kannauj\"&gt;Kannauj&lt;/a&gt; (in present &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; state) his capital, and ruled till 647 CE. Harsha was defeated by the south Indian Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pulakeshin%20II\"&gt;Pulakeshin II&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Chalukya%20dynasty\"&gt;Chalukya dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the Battle of Narmada, when Harsha tried to expand his Empire into the southern peninsula of India.\nThe peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt; visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity. His biography \"&lt;a href=\"Harshacharita\"&gt;Harshacharita&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Deeds of Harsha\") written by Sanskrit poet &lt;a href=\"Banabhatta\"&gt;Banabhatta&lt;/a&gt;, describes his association with Thanesar, besides mentioning the defence wall, a moat and the palace with a two-storied \"Dhavalagriha\" (white mansion).\nOrigins.\nAfter the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the 6th century, North India was split into several independent kingdoms. The northern and western regions of India passed into the hands of a dozen or more feudatory states. Prabhakara Vardhana, the ruler of Sthanvisvara, who belonged to the Vardhana family, extended his control over neighbouring states. Prabhakar Vardhana was the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at &lt;a href=\"Thanesar\"&gt;Thaneswar&lt;/a&gt;. After Prabhakar Vardhana's death in 605, his eldest son, Rajya Vardhana, ascended the throne. Harsha Vardhana was Rajya Vardhana's younger brother. This period of kings from the same line has been referred to as the Vardhana dynasty in many publications.\nAt the time of &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Hwen Tshang&lt;/a&gt;'s visit, &lt;a href=\"Kanoj\"&gt;Kanoj&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of Raja Harshvardhan, the most powerful sovereign in Northern India. According to &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Harsha was of the &lt;a href=\"Bais%20Rajput\"&gt;Bais&lt;/a&gt; clan of Kshatriyas (modern Rajputs).\nAscension.\nHarsha's sister Rajyashri had been married to the Maukhari king, Grahavarman. This king, some years later, had been defeated and killed by king Devagupta of Malwa and after his death Rajyashri had been cast into prison by the victor. Harsha's brother, Rajya Vardhana, then the king at &lt;a href=\"Thanesar\"&gt;Thanesar&lt;/a&gt;, could not accept this affront on his family. So he marched against Devagupta and defeated him. However, &lt;a href=\"Shashanka\"&gt;Shashanka&lt;/a&gt;, king of Gauda in Eastern &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, then entered &lt;a href=\"Magadha\"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but in secret alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Malwa\"&gt;Malwa&lt;/a&gt; king. Accordingly, Shashanka treacherously murdered Rajyavardhana. In the meantime, Rajyasri escaped into forests. On hearing about the murder of his brother, Harsha resolved at once to march against the treacherous king of Gauda, but this campaign remained inconclusive and beyond a point he turned back. Harsha ascended the throne at the age of 16. His first responsibility was to rescue his sister and to avenge the killings of his brother and brother-in-law. He rescued his sister when she was about to immolate herself.\nReign.\nAs &lt;a href=\"North%20India\"&gt;North India&lt;/a&gt; reverted to small republics and small monarchical states ruled by Gupta rulers after the fall of the prior &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Harsha united the small republics from Punjab to central &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and their representatives crowned him king at an assembly in April 606 giving him the title of Maharaja. Harsha established &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Harsha\"&gt;an empire&lt;/a&gt; that brought all of northern India under his control. The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of &lt;a href=\"cosmopolitanism\"&gt;cosmopolitanism&lt;/a&gt;, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt; visited the court of Harsha, and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity.\n&lt;a href=\"Pulakeshin%20II\"&gt;Pulakeshin II&lt;/a&gt; repelled an invasion led by Harsha on the banks of Narmada in the winter of 618\u2013619. Pulakeshin then entered into a treaty with Harsha, with the &lt;a href=\"Narmada%20River\"&gt;Narmada River&lt;/a&gt; designated as the border between the Chalukya Empire and that of Harshavardhana.\nXuanzang describes the event thus:\nIn 648, &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Taizong%20of%20Tang\"&gt;Tang Taizong&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Xuance\"&gt;Wang Xuance&lt;/a&gt; to India in response to emperor Harsha having sent an ambassador to China. However once in India he discovered Harsha had died and the new king Aluonashun (supposedly &lt;a href=\"Arun%C4%81sva\"&gt;Arun\u0101sva&lt;/a&gt;) attacked Wang and his 30 mounted subordinates. This led to Wang Xuance escaping to Tibet, also secured a reported Buddhist relic for China. He fought back to India with &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Empire\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Licchavi%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Licchavi&lt;/a&gt; force, during the war, it's claimed that the new king was among the captives during Wang Xuance's attack.\nReligion.\nLike many other ancient Indian rulers, Harsha was &lt;a href=\"eclecticism\"&gt;eclectic&lt;/a&gt; in his religious views and practices. His seals describe his ancestors as &lt;a href=\"Surya\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;-worshippers, his elder brother as a &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;, and himself as a &lt;a href=\"Shaivism\"&gt;Shaivite&lt;/a&gt;. His land grant inscriptions describe him as \"Parama-maheshvara\" (supreme devotee of Shiva). His court poet &lt;a href=\"B%C4%81%E1%B9%87abha%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADa\"&gt;Bana&lt;/a&gt; also describes him as a Shaivite.\nHarsha's play \"&lt;a href=\"Nagananda\"&gt;N\u0101g\u0101nanda&lt;/a&gt;\" tells the story of the Bodhisattva J\u012bm\u016btav\u0101havana, and the invocatory verse at the beginning is dedicated to the Buddha, described in the act of vanquishing M\u0101ra (so much so that the two verses, together with a third, are also preserved separately in Tibetan translation as the *M\u0101rajit-stotra. Shiva's consort &lt;a href=\"Parvati\"&gt;Gauri&lt;/a&gt; plays an important role in the play, and raises the hero to life using her divine power.\nAccording to the Chinese Buddhist traveler &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt;, Harsha was a devout &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;. Xuanzang states that Harsha banned animal slaughter for food, and built monasteries at the places visited by &lt;a href=\"Gautama%20Buddha\"&gt;Gautama Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. He erected several thousand 100-feet high &lt;a href=\"stupa\"&gt;stupa&lt;/a&gt;s on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Ganges%20river\"&gt;Ganges river&lt;/a&gt;, and built well-maintained &lt;a href=\"hospice\"&gt;hospice&lt;/a&gt;s for travellers and poor people on highways across India. He organized an annual assembly of global scholars, and bestowed charitable alms on them. Every five years, he held a great assembly called &lt;a href=\"Moksha\"&gt;Moksha&lt;/a&gt;. Xuanzang also describes a 21-day religious festival organized by Harsha in &lt;a href=\"Kannauj\"&gt;Kannauj&lt;/a&gt;; during this festival, Harsha and his subordinate kings performed daily rituals before a life-sized golden statue of the Buddha.\nSince Harsha's own records describe him as Shaivite, his conversion to Buddhism would have happened, if at all, in the later part of his life. Even Xuanzang states that Harsha patronised scholars of all religions, not just Buddhist monks. According to historians such as S. R. Goyal and &lt;a href=\"S.%20V.%20Sohoni\"&gt;S. V. Sohoni&lt;/a&gt;, Harsha was personally a Shaivite and his patronage to Buddhists misled Xuanzang to portray him as a Buddhist.\nLiterary prowess.\nHarsha is widely believed to be the author of three Sanskrit plays &lt;a href=\"Ratnavali\"&gt;Ratnavali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagananda\"&gt;Nagananda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priyadarsika\"&gt;Priyadarsika&lt;/a&gt;. While some believe (e.g., ) that it was Dh\u0101vaka, Harsha's one of court poets who wrote the plays as a paid commission, &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Doniger\"&gt;Wendy Doniger&lt;/a&gt; is \"persuaded, however, that king Harsha really wrote the plays ... himself.\"\nIn popular culture.\nA 1926 Indian silent film, \"Samrat Shiladitya\", about the emperor was directed by Mohan Dayaram Bhavnani."
