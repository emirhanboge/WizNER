    "text": "The Dassault Rafale (, literally meaning \"gust of wind\", and \"burst of fire\" in a more military sense) is a French &lt;a href=\"Twinjet\"&gt;twin-engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canard%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;canard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"delta%20wing\"&gt;delta wing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Multirole%20combat%20aircraft\"&gt;multirole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fighter%20aircraft\"&gt;fighter aircraft&lt;/a&gt; designed and built by &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Aviation\"&gt;Dassault Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is intended to perform &lt;a href=\"air%20supremacy\"&gt;air supremacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Air%20interdiction\"&gt;interdiction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aerial%20reconnaissance\"&gt;aerial reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"close%20air%20support\"&gt;ground support&lt;/a&gt;, in-depth strike, &lt;a href=\"anti-ship%20warfare\"&gt;anti-ship strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20warfare\"&gt;nuclear deterrence&lt;/a&gt; missions. The Rafale is referred to as an \"omnirole\" aircraft by Dassault.\nIn the late 1970s, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Air%20Force\"&gt;French Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; were seeking to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft. In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales, France entered into an arrangement with the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (which would become the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;). Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development programme. Dassault built a &lt;a href=\"Prototype\"&gt;technology demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; which first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project. The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its era in that it is almost entirely built by one country, involving most of France's major &lt;a href=\"Arms%20industry\"&gt;defence contractors&lt;/a&gt;, such as Dassault, &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Safran\"&gt;Safran&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the aircraft's avionics and features, such as &lt;a href=\"direct%20voice%20input\"&gt;direct voice input&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"RBE2%23Further%20development\"&gt;RBE2 AA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"active%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;active electronically scanned array&lt;/a&gt; (AESA) radar and the \"&lt;a href=\"optronique%20secteur%20frontal\"&gt;optronique secteur frontal&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"infra-red%20search%20and%20track\"&gt;infra-red search and track&lt;/a&gt; (IRST) sensor, were domestically developed and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant delays due to post-&lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft is available in three main variants: Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based version.\nIntroduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both the French Air Force and for &lt;a href=\"carrier-based%20aircraft\"&gt;carrier-based&lt;/a&gt; operations in the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export to several countries, and was selected for purchase by the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Egyptian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Qatar Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Hellenic Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Croatian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United Arab Emirates Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nIn the mid-1970s, both the French Air Force (\"Arm\u00e9e de l'Air\") and Navy (\"Marine Nationale\") had requirements for a new generation of fighters to replace those in or about to enter service. Because their requirements were similar, and to reduce cost, both departments issued a common request for proposal. In 1975, the French Ministry of Aviation initiated studies for a new aircraft to complement the upcoming and smaller &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000\"&gt;Dassault Mirage 2000&lt;/a&gt;, with each aircraft optimised for differing roles.\nIn 1979, the French company Dassault joined the &lt;a href=\"Messerschmitt-B%C3%B6lkow-Blohm\"&gt;MBB&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"British%20Aerospace\"&gt;BAe&lt;/a&gt; \"European Collaborative Fighter\" project which was renamed the \"European Combat Aircraft\" (ECA). The French company contributed the aerodynamic layout of a prospective twin-engine, single-seat fighter; however, the project collapsed in 1981 due to differing operational requirements of each partner country. In 1983, the \"Future European Fighter Aircraft\" (FEFA) programme was initiated, bringing together Italy, Spain, &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, France and the United Kingdom to jointly develop a new fighter, although the latter three had their own aircraft developments.\nA number of factors led to the eventual split between France and the other four countries. Around 1984 France reiterated its requirement for a &lt;a href=\"Carrier-based%20aircraft\"&gt;carrier-capable&lt;/a&gt; version and demanded a leading role. It also insisted on a swing-role fighter that was lighter than the design favoured by the other four nations. West Germany, the UK and Italy opted out and established a new European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme. In &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt; on 2 August 1985, West Germany, the UK and Italy agreed to go ahead with the EFA, and confirmed that France, along with Spain, had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project. Despite pressure from France, Spain rejoined the Eurofighter project in early September 1985. The four-nation project eventually resulted in the development of the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign phase and prototype.\nIn France, the government proceeded with its own programme. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28France%29\"&gt;French Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; required an aircraft capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground, &lt;a href=\"Night%20fighter\"&gt;all-day&lt;/a&gt; and adverse weather operations. Unlike other contemporary European fighter projects that required some level of international collaboration and cost-sharing, France was the sole developer of the Rafale's &lt;a href=\"airframe\"&gt;airframe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"avionics\"&gt;avionics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jet%20engine\"&gt;propulsion system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20aircraft%20weapons\"&gt;armament&lt;/a&gt;, and as such the aircraft was to replace a multitude of aircraft in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;French Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. The Rafale would perform roles previously filled by an assortment of specialised platforms, including the &lt;a href=\"SEPECAT%20Jaguar\"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%20F1\"&gt;Mirage F1C/CR/CT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000\"&gt;Mirage 2000C/-5&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000N/2000D\"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt; in the French Air Force, and the &lt;a href=\"Vought%20F-8%20Crusader\"&gt;F-8P Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20%C3%89tendard%20IV\"&gt;\u00c9tendard IVP/M&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dassault-Breguet%20Super%20%C3%89tendard\"&gt;Super \u00c9tendard&lt;/a&gt; in French Naval Aviation.\nDuring October\u2013December 1978, prior to France's joining of the ECA, Dassault received contracts for the development of project ACT 92 (\"Avion de Combat Tactique\", meaning \"Tactical Combat Airplane\"). The following year, the National Office for Aviation Studies and Research began studying the possible configurations of the new fighter under the codename \"Rapace\" (meaning \"Bird of Prey\"). By March 1980, the number of configurations had been narrowed down to four, two of which had a combination of &lt;a href=\"canard%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;canards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"delta%20wing\"&gt;delta wing&lt;/a&gt;s and a single &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20stabilizer\"&gt;vertical tail-fin&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1982, the French Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault would build a &lt;a href=\"Prototype\"&gt;technology demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; named \"Avion de Combat exp\u00e9rimental\" (Experimental Combat Airplane, ACX). France wanted to collaborate with West Germany and the UK on the project, but was prepared to build the ACX by itself. In 1984, the government decided to proceed with a combat variant of the ACX due to the conflicting technical criteria of the respective FEFA participant nations.\nThe resultant Rafale A technology demonstrator was a large-delta winged fighter, with all-moving canards, embodying &lt;a href=\"fly-by-wire\"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; (FBW) &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20flight%20control%20system\"&gt;flight control system&lt;/a&gt;. Construction of the demonstrator commenced in March 1984, even before a contract was signed with the &lt;a href=\"Direction%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20de%20l%27armement\"&gt;DGA&lt;/a&gt;, France's &lt;a href=\"Military%20acquisition\"&gt;defence procurement agency&lt;/a&gt;. The technology demonstrator was rolled out in December 1985 in &lt;a href=\"Saint-Cloud\"&gt;Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and took its &lt;a href=\"maiden%20flight\"&gt;maiden flight&lt;/a&gt; on 4 July 1986 from &lt;a href=\"Istres-Le%20Tub%C3%A9%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in southern France. During the one-hour flight, the project's chief &lt;a href=\"test%20pilot\"&gt;test pilot&lt;/a&gt; Guy Mitaux-Maurouard took the aircraft to an altitude of and a speed of &lt;a href=\"Mach%20number\"&gt;Mach&lt;/a&gt;\u00a01.3. The demonstrator stopped in upon landing.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"flight%20test\"&gt;flight test&lt;/a&gt; programme, the Rafale A performed numerous day and night take-offs and landings aboard the carriers and to investigate the pilot's field of view during carrier operations. It reached a speed of and a height of . The demonstrator was initially powered by &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric%20F404\"&gt;General Electric F404-GE-400&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"afterburner\"&gt;afterburning&lt;/a&gt; turbofans from the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the &lt;a href=\"Snecma%20M88\"&gt;Snecma M88&lt;/a&gt;, to reduce the risk that often comes with a first flight, and since the M88 was not considered sufficiently mature for the initial trials programme. It was not until May 1990 when the M88 replaced the port F404 in the demonstrator to enable the aircraft to reach Mach\u00a01.4 and demonstrate &lt;a href=\"supercruise\"&gt;supercruise&lt;/a&gt;, or sustained &lt;a href=\"supersonic%20flight\"&gt;supersonic flight&lt;/a&gt; without use of &lt;a href=\"afterburner\"&gt;afterburner&lt;/a&gt;s. After 865 flights with four pilots, Rafale A was retired in January 1994.\nAt the time of the Rafale A's maiden flight, France entered unsuccessful talks with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway about a possible collaboration on the Rafale as a multinational project; at the time, Belgium was reportedly interested in the Rafale B. In June 1987, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Chirac\"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; declared that the country would proceed with the US$30\u00a0billion project. Subsequently, on 21 April 1988, the French government awarded Dassault a contract for four Rafale prototypes: one Rafale C, two Rafale Ms and one Rafale B. The first out of an expected 330 Rafales was scheduled to enter service in 1996. However, the &lt;a href=\"fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;fall of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;, which signalled the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the need to reduce the national deficit, compelled the French government to drastically reduce its defence budget; the 1994 budget for the Rafale programme was cut by US$340 million. This reduced the size of the Rafale orders, which Dassault and other companies involved claimed impeded production management and led to higher costs, and delayed the entry of the aircraft into service. The French Air Force was reorganised, the Mirage 5F was completely phased out and a total of 55 Mirage F1Cs were upgraded to a tactical fighter configuration, redesignated as Mirage F1CT. The budget cuts prolonged the Rafale's development considerably.\nDuring the Rafale A flight test programme, the French government in 1989 looked at the F/A-18 Hornet as a potential replacement for the rapidly aging &lt;a href=\"F-8%20Crusader\"&gt;F-8 Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, which had been serving since the 1950s. The French Navy entered purchase of second-hand F/A-18s with Australia, Canada and the US, after the decision was made not to upgrade the Crusaders. The US Navy agreed to supply two F/A-18s to the French Navy for \"interoperability testing\" aboard the French aircraft carrier \"Foch\". The French government did not proceed with a purchase of the twin-engine fighter.\nTesting.\nTo meet the various roles expected of the new aircraft, the Air Force required two variants: the single-seat \"Rafale C\" (\"chasseur\", meaning \"fighter\" or literally \"hunter\") and the \"Rafale B\" (\"biplace\", or two-seater). The prototype of the C model (designated C01) completed its first flight on 19 May 1991, signalling the start of a test programme which primarily aimed to test the M88-2 engines, &lt;a href=\"User%20interface\"&gt;man-machine interface&lt;/a&gt; and weapons, and expand the &lt;a href=\"flight%20envelope\"&gt;flight envelope&lt;/a&gt;. Due to budget constraints, the second single-seat prototype was never built.\nThe C01 differed significantly from the Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, and the addition of &lt;a href=\"radar-absorbent%20material\"&gt;radar-absorbent material&lt;/a&gt;s (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of &lt;a href=\"Composite%20material\"&gt;composite&lt;/a&gt; and other materials, which both reduced the &lt;a href=\"radar%20cross-section\"&gt;radar cross-section&lt;/a&gt; (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated &lt;a href=\"Air%20brake%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;air brake&lt;/a&gt;, which lessens maintenance loads and saves weight. The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993. It was heavier than the single-seater, but carried less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two external tanks, two &lt;a href=\"Apache%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shadow\"&gt;Scalp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cruise%20missile\"&gt;cruise missile&lt;/a&gt;s, in addition to four &lt;a href=\"air-to-air%20missile\"&gt;air-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Navy, meanwhile, sought a carrier-based aircraft to supersede its fleet of ageing \u00c9tendard IV Ms &amp; Ps, F-8P Crusaders and &lt;a href=\"Dassault-Breguet%20Super%20%C3%89tendard%23France\"&gt;Super \u00c9tendard Modernis\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;. While the Navy initially modernised the Crusaders, in the long-term, the requirement was met with the navalised Rafale M. The M01, the naval prototype, first flew on 12 December 1991, followed by the second on 8 November 1993. Since France had no land-based catapult test facility, catapult trials were initially carried out between during July\u2013August 1992 and early the following year, at &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Engineering%20Station%20Lakehurst\"&gt;NAS Lakehurst&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft then carried out trials aboard the carrier \"Foch\" in April 1993. Flown by Dassault's chief test pilot, Yves Kerherv\u00e9, M02 made its maiden flight in November that year, while the first prototype completed the third round of testing at Lakehurst in November and December 1993.\nProduction and upgrades.\nInitially, the Rafale B was to be just a trainer, but the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20War\"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt; showed that a second crew member was invaluable on strike and &lt;a href=\"Reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; missions. Therefore, in 1991 the Air Force switched its preferences towards the two-seater, announcing that the variant would constitute 60 percent of the Rafale fleet. The service originally envisaged taking delivery of 250 Rafales, but this was initially revised downwards to 234 aircraft, made up of 95 \"A\" and 139 \"B\" models\", and later to 212 aircraft. The Navy, meanwhile, had 60 Rafales on order, down from 86 due to budget cuts. Of the 60, 25 would be M single-seaters and 35 two-seat Ns, though the two-seater was later cancelled.\nProduction of the first aircraft series formally started in December 1992, but was suspended in November 1995 due to political and economic uncertainty. Production only resumed in January 1997 after the Ministry of Defence and Dassault agreed on a 48-aircraft (28 firm and 20 options) production run with delivery between 2002 and 2007. A further order of 59\u00a0F3 Rafales was announced in December 2004. In November 2009 the French government ordered an additional 60 aircraft to take the total order for the French Air Force and Navy to 180.\nDuring the Rafale's design phase, Dassault took advantage of &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Syst%C3%A8mes\"&gt;Dassault Syst\u00e8mes&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"CATIA\"&gt;CATIA&lt;/a&gt; (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application), a three-dimensional &lt;a href=\"computer-aided%20design\"&gt;computer-aided design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Computer-aided%20manufacturing\"&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Computer-aided%20engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"software%20suite\"&gt;software suite&lt;/a&gt; that would become standard across the industry. CATIA enabled digitisation and efficiency improvements throughout the Rafale programme, as it implemented recently developed processes such as &lt;a href=\"digital%20mockup\"&gt;digital mockup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"product%20data%20management\"&gt;product data management&lt;/a&gt;. It consisted of 15\u00a0GB databases of each of the Rafale's components, assisting with various aspects of the design, manufacture and through-life support.\nAccording to the French magazine \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Usine%20nouvelle\"&gt;L'Usine nouvelle&lt;/a&gt;\", apart from several non-sensitive components sourced from the United States, the Rafale is manufactured almost entirely in France. Different elements are produced in numerous factories across the country, and final assembly takes place near &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux%E2%80%93M%C3%A9rignac%20Airport\"&gt;Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the &lt;a href=\"flight%20control%20surfaces\"&gt;flight control surfaces&lt;/a&gt; are fabricated in &lt;a href=\"Haute-Savoie\"&gt;Haute-Savoie&lt;/a&gt;, the wings and avionics in Gironde, the centre fuselage in &lt;a href=\"Val-d%27Oise\"&gt;Val-d'Oise&lt;/a&gt;, and the engines in &lt;a href=\"Essonne\"&gt;Essonne&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly 50 percent of the Rafale is produced by Dassault and the other half divided between two major partners, &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Safran\"&gt;Safran&lt;/a&gt;, who rely on a network of 500 &lt;a href=\"subcontractor\"&gt;subcontractor&lt;/a&gt;s. Altogether, the programme employs 7,000 workers. , the fabrication process of each fighter took 24 months, with an annual production rate of eleven aircraft.\nDeliveries of the Rafale's naval version were a high priority to replace the Navy's considerably aged F-8 Crusaders, and so the first production model for the French Navy undertook its first flight on 7 July 1999. Their first naval deployment was in 2002 on board \"&lt;a href=\"French%20aircraft%20carrier%20Charles%20de%20Gaulle\"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt;\"; by March 2002, the aircraft carrier was stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Oman\"&gt;Gulf of Oman&lt;/a&gt;, where its complement of Rafales undertook training operations. In December 2004, the Air Force received its first three F2 standard Rafale Bs at the \"Centre d'Exp\u00e9riences A\u00e9riennes Militaires\" (CEAM, i.e. the Military Air Experiment Centre) at &lt;a href=\"Mont-de-Marsan\"&gt;Mont-de-Marsan&lt;/a&gt;, where they were tasked to undertake operational evaluation and pilot conversion training.\nThe total programme cost, as of FY2013, was around \u20ac45.9\u00a0billion, which translated to a unit programme cost of approximately \u20ac160.5\u00a0million. This figure takes in account improved hardware of the F3 standard, and which includes development costs over a period of 40 years, including inflation. The unit &lt;a href=\"Flyaway%20cost\"&gt;flyaway price&lt;/a&gt; as of 2010 was \u20ac101.1\u00a0million for the F3+ version.\nIn 2008, French officials were reportedly considering equipping the Rafale to launch &lt;a href=\"miniaturized%20satellite\"&gt;miniaturised satellites&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, upgrades under consideration included a software radio and satellite link, a new laser-targeting pod, smaller bombs and enhancements to the aircraft's data-fusion capacity. In July 2012, fleetwide upgrades of the Rafale's battlefield communications and interoperability capabilities commenced.\nIn January 2014, Defence Minister &lt;a href=\"Jean-Yves%20Le%20Drian\"&gt;Jean-Yves Le Drian&lt;/a&gt; announced that \u20ac1\u00a0billion is allocated towards the development of the F3R standard. The standard will see the integration of the Meteor BVR missile, among other weapons and software updates. The standard was to be validated by 2018.\nFrom 26 to 29 April 2021, a first test campaign was carried out by aircraft configured with the new F4-1 standard.\nThe Rafale is planned to be the French Air Force's primary combat aircraft until 2040 or later, until replacement by the Franco-German &lt;a href=\"New%20Generation%20Fighter\"&gt;New Generation Fighter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuture replacement.\nIn 2018, Dassault announced the successor to the Rafale as the &lt;a href=\"New%20Generation%20Fighter\"&gt;New Generation Fighter&lt;/a&gt;. This fighter aircraft under development by &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Aviation\"&gt;Dassault Aviation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20Defence%20and%20Space\"&gt;Airbus Defence and Space&lt;/a&gt;, is to replace France's Rafale, Germany's Eurofighter Typhoon, and Spain's F/A-18 Hornet in the 2030-2040 timeframe.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe Rafale was developed as a modern jet fighter with a very high level of agility; Dassault chose to combine a delta wing with &lt;a href=\"Canard%20%28aeronautics%29%23Close%20coupling\"&gt;active close-coupled canard&lt;/a&gt; to maximize manoeuvrability. The aircraft is capable of withstanding from \u22123.6\"g\" to 9\"g\" (10.5\"g\" on Rafale solo display and a maximum of 11\"g\" can be reached in case of emergency). The Rafale is an &lt;a href=\"relaxed%20stability\"&gt;aerodynamically unstable&lt;/a&gt; aircraft and uses &lt;a href=\"Fly-by-wire%23Digital%20systems\"&gt;digital fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; flight controls to artificially enforce and maintain stability. The aircraft's canards also act to reduce the minimum landing speed to ; while in flight, airspeeds as low as have been observed during training missions. According to simulations by Dassault, the Rafale has sufficient low speed performance to operate from &lt;a href=\"STOBAR\"&gt;STOBAR&lt;/a&gt;-configured aircraft carriers, and can take off using a ski-jump with no modifications.\nThe Rafale M features a greatly reinforced &lt;a href=\"Landing%20gear\"&gt;undercarriage&lt;/a&gt; to cope with the additional stresses of naval landings, an &lt;a href=\"Tailhook\"&gt;arrestor hook&lt;/a&gt;, and \"jump strut\" nosewheel, which only extends during short takeoffs, including &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt; launches. It also features a built-in ladder, carrier-based &lt;a href=\"microwave%20landing%20system\"&gt;microwave landing system&lt;/a&gt;, and the new fin-tip Telemir system for syncing the &lt;a href=\"inertial%20navigation%20system\"&gt;inertial navigation system&lt;/a&gt; to external equipment. Altogether, the naval modifications of the Rafale M increase its weight by compared to other variants. The Rafale M retains about 95 percent &lt;a href=\"commonality\"&gt;commonality&lt;/a&gt; with Air Force variants including, although unusual for carrier-based aircraft, being unable to fold its multi-spar wings to reduce storage space. The size constraints were offset by the introduction of , France's first &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20marine%20propulsion\"&gt;nuclear-powered carrier&lt;/a&gt;, which was considerably larger than previous carriers, \"Foch\" and \"Clemenceau\".\nRadar signature.\nAlthough not a full-aspect &lt;a href=\"stealth%20aircraft\"&gt;stealth aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of which was viewed as unacceptably excessive, the Rafale was designed for a reduced &lt;a href=\"radar%20cross-section\"&gt;radar cross-section&lt;/a&gt; (RCS) and &lt;a href=\"infrared%20signature\"&gt;infrared signature&lt;/a&gt; . In order to reduce the RCS, changes from the initial technology demonstrator include a reduction in the size of the tail-fin, fuselage reshaping, repositioning of the engine &lt;a href=\"intake\"&gt;air inlets&lt;/a&gt; underneath the aircraft's wing, and the extensive use of &lt;a href=\"composite%20material\"&gt;composite material&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Serration\"&gt;serrated&lt;/a&gt; patterns for the construction of the trailing edges of the wings and canards. Seventy percent of the Rafale's surface area is composite. Many of the features designed to reduce the Rafale's visibility to threats remain classified.\nCockpit.\nThe Rafale's &lt;a href=\"glass%20cockpit\"&gt;glass cockpit&lt;/a&gt; was designed around the principle of &lt;a href=\"data%20fusion\"&gt;data fusion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a central computer selects and prioritises information to display to pilots for simpler command and control. The primary flight controls are arranged in a &lt;a href=\"HOTAS\"&gt;hands-on-throttle-and-stick&lt;/a&gt; (HOTAS)-compatible configuration, with a right-handed &lt;a href=\"side-stick\"&gt;side-stick&lt;/a&gt; controller and a left-handed throttle. The seat is inclined rearwards at an angle of 29\u00b0 to improve &lt;a href=\"g-force\"&gt;g-force&lt;/a&gt; tolerance during manoeuvring and to provide a less restricted external pilot view. An intelligent &lt;a href=\"flight%20suit\"&gt;flight suit&lt;/a&gt; worn by the pilot is automatically controlled by the aircraft to counteract in response to calculated g-forces.\nGreat emphasis has been placed on pilot workload minimisation across all operations. Among the features of the highly digitised cockpit is an integrated &lt;a href=\"direct%20voice%20input\"&gt;direct voice input&lt;/a&gt; (DVI) system, allowing a range of aircraft functions to be controlled by spoken voice commands, simplifying the pilot's access to many of the controls. Developed by &lt;a href=\"Crouzet%20Automatismes\"&gt;Crouzet&lt;/a&gt;, the DVI is capable of managing radio communications and &lt;a href=\"Active%20protection%20system\"&gt;countermeasures&lt;/a&gt; systems, the selection of armament and radar modes, and controlling navigational functions. For safety reasons, DVI is deliberately not employed for safety-critical elements of the aircraft's operation, such as the final release of weapons.\nFor displaying information gathered from a range of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic &lt;a href=\"head-up%20display\"&gt;head-up display&lt;/a&gt; (HUD) system, two head-down &lt;a href=\"Flat%20panel%20display\"&gt;flat-panel&lt;/a&gt; colour &lt;a href=\"multi-function%20display\"&gt;multi-function display&lt;/a&gt;s (MFDs) as well as a central &lt;a href=\"Collimator%20sight\"&gt;collimated&lt;/a&gt; display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment. Some displays feature a &lt;a href=\"touch%20interface\"&gt;touch interface&lt;/a&gt; for ease of &lt;a href=\"human%E2%80%93computer%20interaction\"&gt;human\u2013computer interaction&lt;/a&gt; (HCI). A &lt;a href=\"head-mounted%20display\"&gt;head-mounted display&lt;/a&gt; (HMD) remains to be integrated to take full advantage of its MICA missiles. The cockpit is fully compatible with &lt;a href=\"Night%20vision%20device\"&gt;night vision goggles&lt;/a&gt; (NVG).\nIn the area of &lt;a href=\"Life%20support%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;life support&lt;/a&gt;, the Rafale is fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Martin-Baker\"&gt;Martin-Baker&lt;/a&gt; Mark 16F \"zero-zero\" &lt;a href=\"ejection%20seat\"&gt;ejection seat&lt;/a&gt;, capable of operation at zero speed and zero altitude. An on-board &lt;a href=\"oxygen%20generating%20system\"&gt;oxygen generating system&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=\"Air%20Liquide\"&gt;Air Liquide&lt;/a&gt;, eliminates the need to carry bulky oxygen canisters. The Rafale's flight computer has been programmed to counteract pilot disorientation and to employ automatic recovery of the aircraft during negative flight conditions. The &lt;a href=\"auto-pilot\"&gt;auto-pilot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"autothrottle\"&gt;autothrottle&lt;/a&gt; controls are also integrated, and are activated by switches located on the primary flight controls.\nAvionics and equipment.\nThe Rafale core avionics systems employ an &lt;a href=\"integrated%20modular%20avionics\"&gt;integrated modular avionics&lt;/a&gt; (IMA), called MDPU (modular data processing unit). This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the &lt;a href=\"flight%20management%20system\"&gt;flight management system&lt;/a&gt;, data fusion, &lt;a href=\"Fire-control%20system\"&gt;fire control&lt;/a&gt;, and the man-machine interface. The total value of the radar, electronic communications and self-protection equipment is about 30 percent of the cost of the entire aircraft. The IMA has since been installed upon several upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters, and incorporated into the civilian airliner, the &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380\"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt;. According to Dassault, the IMA greatly assists combat operations via data fusion, the continuous integration and analysis of the various sensor systems throughout the aircraft, and has been designed for the incorporation of new systems and avionics throughout the Rafale's service life.\nThe Rafale features an integrated &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20aids%20system\"&gt;defensive-aids system&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Thales%20SPECTRA\"&gt;SPECTRA&lt;/a&gt;, which protects the aircraft against airborne and ground threats, developed as a joint venture between Thales and &lt;a href=\"MBDA\"&gt;MBDA&lt;/a&gt;. Various methods of detection, &lt;a href=\"Radar%20jamming%20and%20deception\"&gt;jamming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flare%20%28countermeasure%29\"&gt;decoying&lt;/a&gt; have been incorporated, and the system has been designed to be highly reprogrammable for addressing new threats and incorporating additional sub-systems in the future. Operations over Libya were greatly assisted by SPECTRA, allowing Rafales to perform missions independently from the support of dedicated &lt;a href=\"Suppression%20of%20Enemy%20Air%20Defenses\"&gt;Suppression of Enemy Air Defences&lt;/a&gt; (SEAD) platforms.\nThe Rafale's ground attack capability is heavily reliant upon sensory targeting pods, such as &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Optronics\"&gt;Thales Optronics&lt;/a&gt;'s Reco New Generation/Areos reconnaissance pod and &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Damocles\"&gt;Damocles&lt;/a&gt; electro-optical/laser &lt;a href=\"Targeting%20pods\"&gt;designation pod&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these systems provide targeting information, enable tactical reconnaissance missions, and are integrated with the Rafale's IMA architecture to provide analysed data feeds to friendly units and ground stations, as well as to the pilot. Damocles provides targeting information to the various armaments carried by the Rafale and is directly integrated with the Rafale's &lt;a href=\"VHF%20Data%20Link\"&gt;VHF&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ultra%20high%20frequency\"&gt;UHF&lt;/a&gt; secure radio to communicate target information with other aircraft. It also performs other key functions such as aerial optical surveillance and is integrated with the navigation system as a &lt;a href=\"FLIR\"&gt;FLIR&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Damocles designation pod was described as \"lacking competitiveness\" when compared to rivals such as the Sniper and &lt;a href=\"LITENING\"&gt;LITENING&lt;/a&gt; pods; so work began on an upgraded pod, designated Damocles XF, with additional sensors and added ability to transmit live video feeds. A new Thales targeting pod, the Talios, was officially unveiled at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show and is expected to be integrated on the Rafale by 2018. Thales' Areos reconnaissance pod is an all-weather, night-and-day-capable reconnaissance system employed on the Rafale, and provides a significantly improved reconnaissance capability over preceding platforms. Areos has been designed to perform reconnaissance under various mission profiles and condition, using multiple day/night sensors and its own independent communications datalinks.\nRadar and sensors.\nThe Rafale was first outfitted with the &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Group\"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RBE2\"&gt;RBE2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"passive%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;passive electronically scanned multi-mode radar&lt;/a&gt;. Thales claims to have achieved increased levels of situational awareness as compared to earlier aircraft through the earlier detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, as well as real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for &lt;a href=\"terrain-following%20radar\"&gt;terrain-following&lt;/a&gt; and the real-time generation of &lt;a href=\"Synthetic%20aperture%20radar\"&gt;high resolution ground maps&lt;/a&gt; for navigation and targeting. In early 1994, it was reported that technical difficulties with the radar had delayed the Rafale's development by six months. In September 2006, \"&lt;a href=\"Flight%20International\"&gt;Flight International&lt;/a&gt;\" reported the Rafale's unit cost had significantly increased due to additional development work to improve the RBE2's detection range.\nThe &lt;a href=\"RBE2%23Further%20development\"&gt;RBE2 AA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"active%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;active electronically scanned array&lt;/a&gt; (AESA) radar now replaces the previous passively scanned RBE2. The RBE2 AA is reported to deliver a greater detection range of 200\u00a0km, improved reliability and reduced maintenance demands over the preceding radar. A Rafale demonstrator began test flights in 2002 and has totaled 100 flight hours as of December 2011. By December 2009, production of the pre-series RBE2 AA radars was underway. In early October 2012, the first Rafale equipped with an RBE2 AA radar arrived at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base for operational service (the development was described by Thales and Dassault as \"on time and on budget\"). By early 2014, the first Air Force front-line squadron were supposed to receive Rafales equipped with the AESA radar, following the French Navy which was slated to receive AESA-equipped Rafales starting in 2013.\nTo enable the Rafale to perform in the air supremacy role, it includes several passive sensor systems. The front-sector electro-optical system or &lt;a href=\"Optronique%20secteur%20frontal\"&gt;Optronique Secteur Frontal&lt;/a&gt; (OSF), developed by Thales, is completely integrated within the aircraft and can operate both in the visible and &lt;a href=\"Infra-red%20search%20and%20track\"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; wavelengths. The OSF enables the deployment of infrared missiles such as the &lt;a href=\"MICA%20%28missile%29\"&gt;MICA&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"beyond%20visual%20range\"&gt;beyond visual range&lt;/a&gt; distances; it can also be used for detecting and identifying airborne targets, as well as those on the ground and at sea. Dassault describes the OSF as being immune to jamming and capable of providing covert long-range surveillance. In 2012, an improved version of the OSF was deployed operationally.\nArmament and standards.\nInitial deliveries of the Rafale M were to the \"F1\" (\"France 1\") standard, which were equipped for the air-to-air interceptor combat duties, but lacked any armament for air-to-ground operations. The F1 standard became operational in 2004. Later deliveries were to the \"F2\" standard, which added the capability for conducting air-to-ground operations; the first F2 standard Rafale M was delivered to the French Navy in May 2006. Starting in 2008 onwards, Rafale deliveries have been to the nuclear-capable F3 standard that also added reconnaissance with the Areos reconnaissance pod, and it has been reported that all aircraft built to the earlier F1 and F2 standards are to be upgraded to become F3s.\nF3 standard Rafales are capable of undertaking many different mission roles with a range of equipment, namely air defence/superiority missions with Mica IR and EM air-to-air missiles, and precision ground attacks typically using &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shadow\"&gt;SCALP EG&lt;/a&gt; cruise missiles and &lt;a href=\"Armement%20Air-Sol%20Modulaire\"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt; Hammer air-to-surface missiles. In addition, anti-shipping missions could be carried out using the AM39 &lt;a href=\"Exocet\"&gt;Exocet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sea%20skimming\"&gt;sea skimming&lt;/a&gt; missile, while reconnaissance flights would use a combination of onboard and external pod-based sensor equipment. Furthermore, the aircraft could conduct nuclear strikes when armed with &lt;a href=\"Air-Sol%20Moyenne%20Port%C3%A9e\"&gt;ASMP-A&lt;/a&gt; missiles. In 2010, France ordered 200 &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28missile%29\"&gt;MBDA Meteor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beyond-visual-range%20missile\"&gt;beyond-visual-range missile&lt;/a&gt;s which will greatly increase the distance at which the Rafale can engage aerial targets when the missile enters service.\nThe F4 standard program was launched on 20 March 2017 by the French ministry of defence.\nFor compatibility with armaments of varying types and origins, the Rafale's onboard store management system is compliant with &lt;a href=\"MIL-STD-1760\"&gt;MIL-STD-1760&lt;/a&gt;, an electrical interface between an aircraft and its carriage stores, thereby simplifying the incorporation of many of their existing weapons and equipment. The Rafale is typically outfitted with 14 &lt;a href=\"hardpoint\"&gt;hardpoint&lt;/a&gt;s (only 13 on Rafale M version), five of which are suitable for heavy armament or equipment such as auxiliary fuel tanks, and has a maximum external load capacity of nine tons. In addition to the above equipment, the Rafale carries the 30\u00a0mm &lt;a href=\"GIAT%2030\"&gt;GIAT 30&lt;/a&gt; revolver cannon and can be outfitted with a range of laser-guided bombs and ground-attack munitions. According to Dassault, the Rafale's onboard mission systems enable ground attack and air-to-air combat operations to be carried out within a single sortie, with many functions capable of simultaneous execution in conjunction with another, increasing survivability and versatility.\nEngines.\nThe Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines, each capable of providing up to of &lt;a href=\"dry%20thrust\"&gt;dry thrust&lt;/a&gt; and with afterburners. The engines feature several advances, including a non-polluting combustion chamber, single-crystal turbine blades, &lt;a href=\"powder%20metallurgy\"&gt;powder metallurgy&lt;/a&gt; disks, and technology to reduce radar and &lt;a href=\"infrared%20signature\"&gt;infrared signature&lt;/a&gt;s. The M88 enables the Rafale to supercruise while carrying four missiles and one drop tank.\nQualification of the M88-2 engine ended in 1996 and the first production engine was delivered by the end of the year. Due to delays in engine production, the Rafale A demonstrator was initially powered by the General Electric F404 engine. In May 2010, a Rafale flew for the first time with the M88-4E engine, an upgraded variant with greater thrust and lower maintenance requirements than the preceding M88-2. The engine is of a &lt;a href=\"modular\"&gt;modular&lt;/a&gt; design for ease of construction and maintenance and to enable older engines to be retrofitted with improved subsections upon availability, such as existing M88-2s being upgraded to M88-4E standard. There has been interest in more powerful M88 engines by potential export customers, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As of 2007, a &lt;a href=\"thrust%20vectoring\"&gt;thrust vectoring&lt;/a&gt; variant of the engine designated as M88-3D was also under development.\nOperational history.\nFrance.\nFrench Naval Aviation.\nIn December 2000, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Naval%20Aviation\"&gt;French Naval Aviation&lt;/a&gt; (\"A\u00e9ronavale\"), the air arm of the French Navy, received its first two Rafale M fighters. On 18 May the following year, the squadron \"Flottille 12F\", which had previously operated the F-8 Crusader, became the first squadron to operate the Rafale after it was officially re-activated prior to the delivery of the sixth Rafale. \"Flottille 12F\" immediately participated in \"Trident d'Or\" aboard the aircraft carrier \"&lt;a href=\"French%20aircraft%20carrier%20Charles%20de%20Gaulle\"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt;\" with warships from ten other nations. During the &lt;a href=\"Military%20exercise\"&gt;maritime exercise&lt;/a&gt;, the Navy tested the Rafale's avionics during simulated interceptions with various foreign aircraft, in addition to carrier take-offs and landings. After almost four years of training, the Rafale M was declared operational with the French Navy in June 2004.\nThe Rafale M is fully compatible with &lt;a href=\"US%20Navy\"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt; aircraft carriers and some French Navy pilots have qualified to fly the aircraft from US Navy flight decks. On 4 June 2010, during an exercise on , a French Rafale became the first jet fighter of a foreign navy to have its engine replaced on board an American aircraft carrier.\nIn 2002, the Rafales were first deployed to a combat zone; seven Rafale Ms embarked aboard \"Charles de Gaulle\" of the French Navy during \"&lt;a href=\"Mission%20H%C3%A9racl%C3%A8s\"&gt;Mission H\u00e9racl\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;\", the French participation in \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom\"&gt;Operation Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt;\". They flew from the aircraft carrier over Afghanistan, but the F1 standard precluded air-to-ground missions and the Rafale did not see any action. In June 2002, while \"Charles de Gaulle\" was in the Arabian Sea, Rafales conducted several patrols near the India-Pakistan border.\nIn 2016, Rafales operating from \"Charles de Gaulle\" struck targets associated with the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant\"&gt;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 2015, American and French military officials reportedly discussed the possibility of French naval Rafale Ms flying combat missions from a US Navy as soon as January 2017. This would enable continued French Navy operations against ISIL while \"Charles de Gaulle\" undergoes its year-and-a-half-long major refit, scheduled to begin in early 2017. Although Rafales have launched and landed on U.S. carriers to demonstrate interoperability, it would be the first time they would fly combat missions from one. As many as 18 Rafale Ms could be deployed on a carrier, although some room would have to be made for French Navy support crews familiar with maintaining the Rafale, as well as for spare parts and munitions. Operation Chesapeake, a test of this interoperability, was conducted in May 2018, when 12 Rafales of Flottilles 11F, 12F, and &lt;a href=\"Flottille%2017F\"&gt;17F&lt;/a&gt;, along with nearly 350 support personnel embarked aboard &lt;a href=\"USS%20George%20H.W.%20Bush\"&gt;USS \"George H.W. Bush\"&lt;/a&gt; for two weeks of carrier qualifications and exercises after conducting a month of shore based training at &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20Oceana\"&gt;Naval Air Station Oceana&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrench Air and Space Force.\nRafales were delivered to the French Air Force several years after the naval variant, initially with the \"Centre d'Exp\u00e9riences A\u00e9riennes Militaires\" (French Air Force Evaluation Centre) at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base in the trials and training role. By this time, it was expected that &lt;a href=\"01.007%20Fighter%20Squadron%20%26quot%3BProvence%26quot%3B\"&gt;\"Escadron de Chasse\" (Fighter Squadron) \"1/7\"&lt;/a&gt; at Saint-Dizier would receive a nucleus of 8\u201310 Rafale F2s during the summer of 2006, in preparation for full operational service (with robust air-to-air and stand off air-to-ground precision attack capabilities) starting from mid-2007 (when \"EC 1/7\" would have about 20 aircraft, 15 two-seaters and five single-seaters).\nIn 2007, after a \"crash program\" enhancement six Rafales were given the ability to drop laser-guided bombs, in view of engaging them in Afghanistan. Three of these aircraft belonging to the Air Force were deployed to &lt;a href=\"Dushanbe\"&gt;Dushanbe&lt;/a&gt; in Tajikistan, while the three others were \"Rafale Marine\" of the Navy on board \"Charles De Gaulle\". The first mission occurred on 12 March 2007, and the first &lt;a href=\"GBU-12\"&gt;GBU-12&lt;/a&gt; was launched on 28 March in support of embattled Dutch troops in Southern Afghanistan, marking the operational d\u00e9but of the Rafale. Between January 2009 and December 2011, a minimum of three Rafales were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Kandahar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Kandahar International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to conduct combat operations in support of NATO ground forces.\nOn 19 March 2011, French Rafales began conducting reconnaissance and &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28attack%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; missions over Libya in &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ration%20Harmattan\"&gt;Op\u00e9ration Harmattan&lt;/a&gt;, in support of &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201973\"&gt;United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973&lt;/a&gt;; initial targets were artillery pieces laying siege around the rebel city of &lt;a href=\"Benghazi\"&gt;Benghazi&lt;/a&gt;. The Rafale could operate in Libya without the support of SEAD aircraft, using the onboard SPECTRA self-defence system instead. On 24 March 2011, it was reported that a Rafale had destroyed a &lt;a href=\"Libyan%20Air%20Force%20%281951%E2%80%932011%29\"&gt;Libyan Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soko%20G-2%20Galeb\"&gt;G-2/Galeb&lt;/a&gt; light attack/trainer aircraft on the runway.\nDuring the conflict, Rafales typically conducted six-hour sorties over Libyan airspace, carrying an armament of four MICA air-to-air missiles, four or six AASM \"Hammer\" bombs, a &lt;a href=\"Thales%20Damocles\"&gt;Thales Damocl\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; targeting pod and two drop tanks; these patrols required multiple aerial refuelling operations per sortie from coalition tanker aircraft. The AASM precision-guidance weapon system, using bombs weighing between and , allowed the Rafale to conduct high-altitude bombing missions. Reportedly, Rafale crews preferred to use GPS-guided munitions due to greater reliability and range. Storm Shadow &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shadow\"&gt;SCALP&lt;/a&gt; weapons were deployed on only one or two sorties, including one against a Libyan airbase at Al-Jufra. In 2011, aviation journalist Craig Hoyle speculated that the Rafale's performance in Libya is likely to be pivotal to its export future, reporting that the Rafale had maintained a high operational rate throughout the deployment. Hoyle also noted that the Libyan combat experience had caused several urgent operational requirements to present themselves, such as the need for a lighter ground-attack munition and to modify the AASM weapon to be more effective in the &lt;a href=\"close%20air%20support\"&gt;close air support&lt;/a&gt; role.\nIn January 2013, the Rafale took part in \"&lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ration%20Serval\"&gt;Op\u00e9ration Serval&lt;/a&gt;\", the French military intervention in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Mali%20conflict%20%282012%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;support to the government of Mali&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20Oneness%20and%20Jihad%20in%20West%20Africa\"&gt;Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The first mission was carried out on 13 January, when four Rafales took off from an airbase in France to strike rebel training camps, depots and facilities in the city of &lt;a href=\"Gao\"&gt;Gao&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Mali. Subsequent airstrikes in the following days by Rafale and Mirage fighters were reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal of Islamist militant forces from &lt;a href=\"Timbuktu\"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Douentza\"&gt;Douentza&lt;/a&gt;. Both Rafale and Mirage 2000D aircraft used in the conflict have been based outside of North Africa, making use of aerial refuelling tanker aircraft to fly long range sorties across Algerian airspace and into Mali.\nIn August 2013, it was proposed that France may halve the number of Rafales to be delivered over the next six years for a total of 26 aircraft to be delivered during this period; foreign export procurements have been viewed as critical to maintain production under this proposal. While production would be slowed, France would still receive the same number of Rafales overall.\nIn September 2014, Rafales began flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq as part of &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ration%20Chammal\"&gt;Op\u00e9ration Chammal&lt;/a&gt;, France's contribution to the international effort to combat &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant\"&gt;Islamic State&lt;/a&gt; (IS) militants. Six (later nine) Rafales were initially tasked with identifying IS positions in support of &lt;a href=\"2014%20military%20intervention%20against%20ISIS\"&gt;US airstrikes&lt;/a&gt;, flying from &lt;a href=\"Al%20Dhafra%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Al Dhafra Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, UAE. On 18 September, Rafales joined American operations in conducting attacks, launching four strikes near the Northern Iraqi town of &lt;a href=\"Zummar\"&gt;Zummar&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed a logistics depot and killed dozens of IS fighters.\nIn April 2018, during the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, five Rafale B fighters from the &lt;a href=\"Escadron%20de%20Chasse%201/4%20Gascogne\"&gt;Escadron de Chasse 1/4 Gascogne&lt;/a&gt; participated in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20missile%20strikes%20against%20Syria\"&gt;2018 missile strikes against Syria&lt;/a&gt;. Each jet was loaded with two &lt;a href=\"SCALP%20EG\"&gt;SCALP EG&lt;/a&gt; missiles.\nEgypt.\nIn November 2014, Egypt was reportedly in negotiations with France to purchase 24 to 36 Rafales, subject to a financing agreement. By February 2015, the two countries were negotiating a loan from France's export credit agency to reach an export agreement for up to 24 Rafale fighters. Egypt hoped to complete the deal quickly to have aircraft on display at the inauguration of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal expansion&lt;/a&gt; in August 2015.\nOn 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales, as part of a larger deal, including a &lt;a href=\"FREMM%20multipurpose%20frigate\"&gt;FREMM multipurpose frigate&lt;/a&gt; and missiles, worth US$5.9\u00a0billion (\u20ac5.2\u00a0billion). The order comprised 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters. In July 2015, a ceremony marking Egypt's acceptance of its first three Rafales, was held at Dassault's flight test center in &lt;a href=\"Istres\"&gt;Istres&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafales for a total of six fighters. All six aircraft are two-seat models (Rafale DM) diverted from deliveries to the French Air Force. Egypt received the third batch of three Rafales flown by Egyptian pilots from France in April 2017; this was included the first single-seat model (Rafale EM) to be delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Egyptian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. Egypt took delivery of the fourth batch of two Rafale EMs in July 2017. The fifth batch, comprising the last 3 Rafale EMs, was delivered in November 2017, increasing the number in service to 14 Rafales.\nIn June 2016, Egypt started negotiations with Dassault to acquire 12 additional Rafales, intending to exercise an option of the first contract. An Egyptian delegation visited France in November 2017 for negotiations. In May 2021, Egypt ordered 30 more Rafales in a contract worth $4.5bn. On 15 November 2021, Egypt confirmed that its air force will receive 30 Rafale F3R between the year 2024 and 2026. Egyptian Air Force is interested in buying the Rafale F4 variant once the Dassault Aviation prepares to next-generation F4 variant for foreign buyers.\nQatar.\nStarting in 2011, the &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20Emiri%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Qatar Emiri Air Force&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the Rafale alongside the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle\"&gt;Boeing F-15E&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; to replace its &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000%23Mirage%202000-5F\"&gt;Dassault Mirage 2000-5&lt;/a&gt; fleet. In June 2014, Dassault claimed it was close to signing a contract with Qatar for 72 Rafales. On 30 April 2015, &lt;a href=\"Sheikh\"&gt;Sheikh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tamim%20bin%20Hamad%20Al%20Thani\"&gt;Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani&lt;/a&gt; announced to French President &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&lt;/a&gt; that Qatar would order 24 Rafale with an option to buy 12 more aircraft. On 4 May, a \u20ac6.3 billion ($7.02 billion) contract for 24 Rafales was finalised; additionally, the contract included the provision of long-range cruise missiles and Meteor missiles as well as the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French military and several Qatari intelligence officers; thus, the price can be viewed as \u20acM for each aircraft. On 7 December 2017, the option for 12 more Rafales was exercised for \u20ac1.1 billion (or \u20acM each) while adding an additional option for 36 further fighters. The first Qatari Rafale was delivered in February 2019.\nIndia.\nThe Rafale was one of the six aircraft competing in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20MRCA%20competition\"&gt;Indian MRCA competition&lt;/a&gt; for 126 multirole fighters. Originally, the Mirage 2000 had been considered for the competition, but Dassault withdrew it in favour of the Rafale. In February 2011, French Rafales flew demonstrations in India, including air-to-air combat against &lt;a href=\"Sukhoi%20Su-30MKI\"&gt;Su-30MKIs&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2011, the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (IAF) shortlisted the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon for the US$10.4\u00a0billion contract. On 31 January 2012, the IAF announced the Rafale as the preferred bidder. It was proposed that 18 Rafales would be supplied to the IAF by 2015 in fly-away condition, while the remaining 108 would be manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hindustan%20Aeronautics%20Limited\"&gt;Hindustan Aeronautics Limited&lt;/a&gt; (HAL) in India under &lt;a href=\"Technology%20transfer\"&gt;transfer of technology&lt;/a&gt; agreements. The contract for 126 Rafales, services, and parts may have been worth up to US$20 billion.\nThe deal stalled due to disagreements over production in India. Dassault refused to take responsibility for the 108 HAL-manufactured Rafales, holding reservations over HAL's ability to accommodate the aircraft's complex manufacturing and technology transfers; instead, Dassault said it would have to negotiate two separate production contracts by both companies. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28India%29\"&gt;Indian Defence Ministry&lt;/a&gt; instead wanted Dassault to be solely responsible for the sale and delivery of all 126 aircraft. In May 2013, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times%20of%20India\"&gt;The Times of India&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that negotiations were \"back on track\", with plans for the first 18 Rafales to be delivered in 2017. In March 2014, the two sides reportedly agreed that the first 18 Rafales would be delivered to India in flying condition and that the remaining 108 would be 70 percent built by HAL. By December 2014, India and France reportedly expected to sign a contract by March 2015.\nIn April 2015, during Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to Paris, India requested the swift delivery of 36 Rafales in a fly-away condition. Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated that these will be inducted into the IAF within two years. India officially withdrew the 126-aircraft MMRCA tender on 30 July 2015. Shortly after, India and France missed the July target to finalise the 36-aircraft agreement. The previously-agreed-upon terms in April totaled US$8 billion for 36 aircraft costing $200 million each, with an offset requirement of 30 percent of the deal's value to be reinvested in India's defence sector and create infrastructure for Rafale operations. India insisted on a 50 percent offset and two bases, which France said would increase costs and require separate infrastructure and two sets of maintenance, training and armament storage facilities. In January 2016, the Indian government directed the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Navy\"&gt;Indian Navy&lt;/a&gt; to be briefed by Dassault on the navalised Rafale for its aircraft carriers, promoting logistics and spares commonalities between Navy and Air Force fighters. Dassault CEO Eric Trappier stated that the Indian Navy may order up to 57 Rafales. On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister &lt;a href=\"Manohar%20Parrikar\"&gt;Manohar Parrikar&lt;/a&gt; and his French counterpart &lt;a href=\"Jean-Yves%20Le%20Drian\"&gt;Jean-Yves Le Drian&lt;/a&gt; signed a \u20ac7.8 billion contract for 36 off-the-shelf Rafales with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price. The first Rafales were expected to be delivered by 2019, and India is set to have all 36 within six years. The deal includes weapons and spares, which included &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; BVRAAM missiles. India considered ordering 36 more Rafales around August 2017 amid tensions with China.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; raised an issue over Dassault partnering with &lt;a href=\"Anil%20Ambani\"&gt;Anil Ambani&lt;/a&gt;'s Reliance Defence, now known as &lt;a href=\"Reliance%20Naval%20and%20Engineering%20Limited\"&gt;Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited&lt;/a&gt; (R-Naval), a private company with no aviation experience, instead of the state owned HAL. Allegedly, Dassault was not given a choice and was compelled to select Reliance Defence as its partner. &lt;a href=\"Rahul%20Gandhi\"&gt;Rahul Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; alleged that it was favouritism and corruption. Both the French government and Dassault issued a press release stating it was Dassault's decision to choose Reliance Defence. Party spokesperson &lt;a href=\"Manish%20Tewari\"&gt;Manish Tewari&lt;/a&gt; asked for the agreement's details to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from \u20b97.15\u00a0billion to \u20b916\u00a0billion. In November 2018, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in the Rafale's acquisition. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case was filed in the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20India\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; for an independent probe into the Rafale procurement. On 14 December 2018, based on all pricing details along with finalising steps, the Apex Court dismissed all petitions, stating it found no irregularities in the buy; Reliance Defence reportedly was set to receive just over 3 per cent of the of offsets, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal.\nIn March 2019, Indian government officials asked for Rafales to replace ageing &lt;a href=\"MiG-21\"&gt;MiG-21&lt;/a&gt;s and to counter &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"F-16\"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt;s. Ahead of the first Rafale's formal hand over on 8 October 2019, The Indian Air Force Day 2019, the IAF accepted the aircraft at Dassault's Bordeaux manufacturing facility in an event attended by Defence Minister &lt;a href=\"Rajnath%20Singh\"&gt;Rajnath Singh&lt;/a&gt; and his French counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Florence%20Parly\"&gt;Florence Parly&lt;/a&gt;; it had tail number \"RB-001\" to mark IAF chief-designate &lt;a href=\"RKS%20Bhadauria\"&gt;Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria's&lt;/a&gt; role in the 2016 deal.\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Rafale is competing against several other aircraft in a new procurement tender for 114 multi-role combat aircraft, which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media.\nDelivery of 36 Rafales started on 27 July 2020 with first 5 Rafales delivered to Indian Air Force from France. By July 2021, a total of 26 Rafales had been received. 35 Rafales are to be delivered by the end of 2021 and the last fighter is to be delivered in January 2022.\nGreece.\nIn August 2020, the government of &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; announced the acquisition of eighteen Rafale multirole aircraft. Initial reports stated that ten would be the new Rafale C variant in F3-R standard with eight older Rafale in F1 and F2 standard in use with the French Air Force, that would be given to Greece. However, later reports stated that all 18 aircraft would be delivered in F3-R standard and would replace an equal number of older &lt;a href=\"Mirage%202000\"&gt;Mirage 2000EGM&lt;/a&gt; aircraft in service with the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Hellenic Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2021, the official agreement with &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Aviation\"&gt;Dassault Aviation&lt;/a&gt; was ratified in the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Parliament\"&gt;Hellenic Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, and included the purchase of six new built, and 12 used F3-R aircraft in previous service with the &lt;a href=\"French%20Air%20and%20Space%20Force\"&gt;Arm\u00e9e de l'Air&lt;/a&gt; at total cost of \u20ac2.4 billion, including their armament and ground support. The inter-governmental agreement was signed on 25 January 2021 by the Defense Ministers of Greece and France. In April 2021, it was reported that Greece is considering acquiring six additional Rafales. The first aircraft, a Rafale B two-seater, was delivered on 21 July 2021.\nOn 11 September 2021, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Kyriakos%20Mitsotakis\"&gt;Kyriakos Mitsotakis&lt;/a&gt; at the 2021 &lt;a href=\"Thessaloniki%20International%20Fair\"&gt;Thessaloniki International Fair&lt;/a&gt; announced the purchase of 6 additional Rafales, to increase the order total to 24.\nOn 19 January 2022, the first 6 Rafales landed at &lt;a href=\"Tanagra%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Tanagra Air Base&lt;/a&gt; where a welcoming ceremony was held.\nFuture operators.\nCroatia.\n&lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; officially received a proposal for 12 second-hand French Air Force Rafales F3Rs in September 2020 for a tender to replace its aging &lt;a href=\"MiG-21\"&gt;MiG-21&lt;/a&gt;s. The total package offered costs &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;1 billion (including weapon systems, spare parts, logistics and training), and competes against new F-16V Block 70, Israeli used F-16C/D Barak brought to standard ACE configuration, and &lt;a href=\"Saab%20JAS%2039%20Gripen\"&gt;Swedish Gripen&lt;/a&gt; C/D. On 28 May 2021, the Prime Minister of Croatia &lt;a href=\"Andrej%20Plenkovi%C4%87\"&gt;Andrej Plenkovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; announced the Croatian Government's decision to buy 12 used French Rafale F3R fighters, to replace the MiG-21bis fighters used by &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Croatian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The contract was signed on 25 November 2021.\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nIn 2009, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United Arab Emirates Air Force&lt;/a&gt; was interested in an upgraded version of the Rafale with more powerful engines and radar, and advanced air-to-air missiles. In October 2011, Dassault was confident that a US$10 billion deal for up to 60 Rafale aircraft would be signed. However, Deputy Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Defence%20Force%20%28UAE%29\"&gt;Union Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20bin%20Zayed%20Al%20Nahyan\"&gt;Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan&lt;/a&gt;, in November 2011 called the French offer \"uncompetitive and unworkable\"; France had in 2010 asked the UAE to pay US$2.6\u00a0billion of the total cost to upgrade the Rafale. Consequently, the UAE started to explore a purchase of the Eurofighter Typhoon or the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.\nThe newspaper \"La Tribune\" reported in February 2012, that the UAE was still considering the US$10-billion deal for 60 Rafales. Interoperability among the Gulf air forces has led to renewed interest in the Rafale from Qatar and Kuwait. In January 2013, President Hollande stated that he would be discussing the potential sale of Rafale to the UAE during an official visit. In December 2013, it was announced that UAE had decided not to proceed with a deal for the supply of defence and security services, including the supply of Typhoon aircraft. In September 2014 it was announced that the UAE could acquire 40 Rafales in addition to upgrades to its existing Mirage 2000s. In November 2015, Reuters reported that Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, had confirmed that the UAE was in final negotiations to purchase 60 Rafales. In 2019 a series of Rafale F3-R trials were conducted at &lt;a href=\"Al%20Dhafra%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Al Dhafra Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in the UAE.\nOn 3 December 2021, Dassault Aviation announced that the UAE had signed an order for 80 Rafale F4 in a government-to-government deal. The recent agreement makes the UAE the largest Rafale operator in the region and second to France. It came after Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to the UAE. The deal was criticized by the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20Watch\"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; due to the Emirates\u2019 involvement in the conflicts in Yemen and Libya.\nPotential operators.\nAnalysts view the relatively quick series of 84 orders from Egypt and Qatar as being influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Spring\"&gt;Arab Spring&lt;/a&gt; and uncertainty of US involvement in the Middle East.\nBangladesh.\nIn 2020 \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Tribune\"&gt;La Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that, on 8 and 9 March, the French Minister of the Armed Forces &lt;a href=\"Florence%20Parly\"&gt;Florence Parly&lt;/a&gt; \"praised performance of the Rafale\" to Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Sheikh%20Hasina\"&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;, who is also Minister of Defense.\nFinland.\nIn June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called &lt;a href=\"HX%20Fighter%20Program\"&gt;HX Fighter Program&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Finnish Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s current fleet of &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18 Hornets&lt;/a&gt;. The group recognises five potential types: &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, Dassault Rafale, &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saab%20JAS%2039%20Gripen\"&gt;Saab JAS 39 Gripen E/F&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 2015, Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US where it informed that the fighter project was launched in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. Dassault Rafale is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The project has been named as HX Fighter Program. The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016; the five responses were received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021. The Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported that several foreign and security policy sources had confirmed the Finnish Defense Forces recommendation of the F-35 as Finland\u2019s next fighter with the F-35's \"capability and expected long lifespan\" as key reasons.\nIndonesia.\nIn January 2020, the Indonesian government expressed some interest in buying up to 48 Rafales to modernise its &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 2021, Indonesia's Minister of Defense &lt;a href=\"Prabowo%20Subianto\"&gt;Prabowo Subianto&lt;/a&gt; announced that the purchase of 36 units, as part of an ambitious procurement programme including &lt;a href=\"A330%20MRTT\"&gt;A330&lt;/a&gt; tankers and complementary American products, is officially planned and that funds have been secured for its finalization. On 7 June 2021, Indonesia signed a letter of intent to buy 36 Rafale fighters and associated weapons and support packages from France. On 20 January 2022, Indonesia's Minister of Defense &lt;a href=\"Prabowo%20Subianto\"&gt;Prabowo Subianto&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Indonesia completed the negotiation of the contract pending activation of the formal agreement by France.\nIraq.\nIn November 2020, Iraqi Defense Minister Jumaa Adnan stated that &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; plans to buy France's Rafales.\nMalaysia.\nThe Rafale was a contender for the replacement of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Malaysian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Malaysian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s (RMAF) &lt;a href=\"Mikoyan%20MiG-29\"&gt;Mikoyan MiG-29&lt;/a&gt;, with a requirement to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighter aircraft with an estimated budget of RM6\u00a0billion to RM8\u00a0billion (US$1.84\u00a0billion to US$2.46\u00a0billion). The other competitors for the program were the Eurofighter Typhoon, &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;Boeing F/A-18/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt; and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In July 2017, the plan to acquire new jet fighters was suspended with the Royal Malaysian Air Force looking instead to buy new maritime patrol aircraft and advanced trainers with light attack capabilities to confront the growing threat of Islamist militants in the Southeast Asian region.\nSerbia.\nThe President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, stated in an interview on 24 December 2021 that Serbia is interested in purchasing new Rafale aircraft, to help strengthen its Air Force.\nSpain.\nSpain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets. Possible participants in the tender will be the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II.\nSwitzerland.\nIn February 2007, it was reported that Switzerland was considering the Rafale and other fighters to replace its ageing &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5\"&gt;Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs&lt;/a&gt;. A one-month evaluation started in October 2008 at Emmen Airforce Base, consisting of approximately 30 evaluation flights; the Rafale, along with the JAS 39 Gripen and the Typhoon, were evaluated. Although a leaked &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swiss Air Force&lt;/a&gt; evaluation report revealed that the Rafale won the competition on technical grounds, on 30 November 2011, the Swiss Federal Council announced that plans to buy 22 Gripen NGs due to the its lower acquisition and maintenance costs. Due to &lt;a href=\"2014%20Swiss%20referendums\"&gt;a referendum&lt;/a&gt;, this purchase never happened.\nIn March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. In October 2018, the Swiss Air Force was reportedly limited to buying a single-engine fighter for budgetary reasons. In May 2019, the Rafale performed demonstration flights at &lt;a href=\"Payerne%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Payerne Air Base&lt;/a&gt; for comparison against other bids. Saab did not participate with the Gripen E because it was not considered ready to perform all tests.\nOn 30 June 2021 the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Council%20%28Switzerland%29\"&gt;Swiss Federal Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to propose to &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Assembly%20%28Switzerland%29\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition of 36 F-35As at a cost of up to 6 billion &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20franc\"&gt;Swiss franc&lt;/a&gt;s (US$6.5 billion), citing the aircraft's cost- and combat-effectiveness. However, it was later confirmed that the costs are capped for a period of just 10 years. It has also been reported that the operating costs would have been reduced by replacing some actual flying with bundled simulators. As in other countries, there have also been complaints that the F-35 is 3 &lt;a href=\"decibel\"&gt;dB&lt;/a&gt; louder than the F/A-18C/D, and the Liberal Greens promised to examine its environmental impact. The Swiss anti-military group &lt;a href=\"GSoA\"&gt;GSoA&lt;/a&gt; also intends to contest the purchase in a national referendum supported by the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Socialists&lt;/a&gt;.\nUkraine.\nIn April 2021, it was reported that Ukraine is seeking to replace its Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s with 36-42 fighters such as the Rafale.\nFailed bids.\nThe Rafale has been marketed for export to various countries. Various commentators and industry sources have highlighted the high cost of the aircraft as detrimental to the Rafale's sales prospects. Its acquisition cost is roughly US$100\u00a0million (2010), while its operational cost hovers around US$16,500 (2012) for every flight-hour. The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate. According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.\nBelgium.\nIn 2009 Belgium suggested that they might buy some F-35s in the 2020s to replace Belgium's fleet of 34 aging F-16A/B MLU fighters. An article published in Belgian newspaper &lt;a href=\"L%27Avenir%20%28Belgian%20newspaper%29\"&gt;L'Avenir&lt;/a&gt; on 19 April 2015 speculated that if the nuclear strike role as part of Belgium's &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20sharing\"&gt;Nuclear sharing&lt;/a&gt; policy were retained in the request for proposals, Belgium would be almost forced to buy the F-35 in order to maintain this role.\nBelgium officially launched its F-16 replacement program in March 2017, issuing requests for proposals to three European and two US manufacturers: &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20Defense%2C%20Space%20%26amp%3B%20Security\"&gt;Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin\"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Aviation\"&gt;Dassault Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20GmbH\"&gt;Eurofighter GmbH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Group\"&gt;Saab Group&lt;/a&gt;, offering the &lt;a href=\"F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;F-35 Lightning II&lt;/a&gt;, Dassault Rafale, &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saab%20JAS%2039%20Gripen\"&gt;Saab JAS 39 Gripen&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nOn 25 October 2018, Belgium officially selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace the current fleet of around 54 F-16s. In the accompanied news conference, government officials stated that the decision to select the F-35 over the Eurofighter Typhoon came down to the price, and later stated that \"The offer from the Americans was the best in all seven evaluation criteria\". The total purchasing price for the aircraft and its support until 2030 totaled \u20ac4 billion, \u20ac600 million cheaper than the initially budgeted \u20ac4.6 billion. In April 2020, the first procurement contract for the F-35 was signed, with deliveries to begin in 2023.\nBrazil.\nIn June 2008, the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Brazilian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; issued a request for information on the following aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 Fighting Falcon, Rafale, &lt;a href=\"Sukhoi%20Su-35\"&gt;Su-35&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gripen%20NG\"&gt;Gripen NG&lt;/a&gt; and Eurofighter Typhoon. In October 2008, the service selected three finalists for F-X2\u00a0\u2013 Dassault Rafale, Gripen NG and Boeing F/A-18E/F. On 5 January 2010, media reports stated that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Gripen ahead of the other two contenders based on unit and operating costs. In February 2011, Brazilian President &lt;a href=\"Dilma%20Rousseff\"&gt;Dilma Rousseff&lt;/a&gt; had reportedly decided in favour of the F/A-18. After delays due to budget constraints, in December 2013, the Brazilian government selected the Gripen NG in a US$5\u00a0billion deal to equip the air force.\nCanada.\nThe Rafale was amongst various fighters proposed to meet Canada's need to replace the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20CF-18%20Hornet\"&gt;McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt; fleet. In 2005, according to Canada.com, a report compiled by Canada's Defence Department reviewing several aircraft noted concerns over the Rafale's interoperability with US forces; Dassault had also then been unable to confirm engine performance during cold weather conditions. In July 2010, the Canadian government announced the CF-18's replacement would be the F-35; the nation was already a partner in the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Strike%20Fighter%20program\"&gt;Joint Strike Fighter program&lt;/a&gt; since 1997 and a Tier 3 partner for the F-35 since 2002. In December 2012, the Canadian government announced that the F-35 purchase had been abandoned due to cost rises and that a fresh procurement process would begin. In January 2013, Dassault responded to a Canadian request for information, announcing its readiness to enter the competition. Various aircraft were considered to meet the requirement, including the F-35. In January 2014, Dassault reportedly offered a contract with full transfer of technology, allowing Canada to perform its own support and upgrades, thereby lowering long-term service costs. In November 2018, Dassault withdrew from the competition, reportedly due to extensive interoperability and intelligence sharing requirements, particularly with U.S. forces, complicated by France's lack of involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Eyes\"&gt;Five Eyes&lt;/a&gt; intelligence-sharing community.\nKuwait.\nIn February 2009, French President &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Sarkozy\"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; announced that Kuwait was considering buying up to 28 Rafales. In October 2009, during a visit to Paris, the Kuwaiti Defence Minister expressed interest in the Rafale and said that he was awaiting Dassault's terms. Islamist lawmakers in the Kuwaiti national assembly threatened to block such a purchase, accusing the Defence Minister of lack of transparency and being manipulated by business interests. In January 2012, the French Defence Minister said that both Kuwait and Qatar were waiting to see if the UAE first purchased the Rafale and that Kuwait would look to buy 18\u201322 Rafales. However, on 11 September 2015, Eurofighter announced that an agreement had been reached with Kuwait to buy 28 Typhoons.\nLibya.\nIn January 2007, the French newspaper \"Journal du Dimanche\" reported that Libya sought 13 to 18 Rafales \"in a deal worth as much as US$3.24\u00a0billion\". In December 2007, &lt;a href=\"Saif%20al-Islam%20Gaddafi\"&gt;Saif al-Islam Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt; declared Libya's interest in the Rafale, but no order was placed. French Rafales later attacked targets in Libya as part of the international &lt;a href=\"military%20intervention\"&gt;military intervention&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Libyan%20civil%20war\"&gt;2011 Libyan civil war&lt;/a&gt;.\nSingapore.\nIn 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Singapore%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Republic of Singapore Air Force&lt;/a&gt; embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace its fleet of ageing &lt;a href=\"ST%20Aerospace%20A-4SU%20Super%20Skyhawk\"&gt;A-4SU Super Skyhawks&lt;/a&gt;. A number of options were considered and the &lt;a href=\"Defence%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Technology%20Agency\"&gt;Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency&lt;/a&gt; (DSTA) conducted a detailed technical assessment, as well as simulations and other tests to determine the final selection. Following this, the original list of competitors was reduced to the final two \u2013 Dassault Rafale and the &lt;a href=\"F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle\"&gt;F-15SG Strike Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2005, Singapore ordered 12 F-15SG aircraft. According to \"Defense Industry Daily\", one major reason for the selection was that, while the Rafale had superior aerodynamics, it lacked the range and a capable radar, and had insufficient weapons and sensor integration.\nOther bids.\nIn 2002, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Korea%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Republic of Korea Air Force&lt;/a&gt; chose the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle\"&gt;F-15K Slam Eagle&lt;/a&gt; over the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 for its 40 aircraft &lt;a href=\"F-X%20fighter%20program%23F-X%20Phase%201\"&gt;F-X Phase 1&lt;/a&gt; fighter competition.\nIn late 2007, \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Tribune\"&gt;La Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that a prospective US$2.85 billion sale to Morocco had fallen through, the government selecting the F-16C/D instead. While French Defense Minister &lt;a href=\"Herv%C3%A9%20Morin\"&gt;Herv\u00e9 Morin&lt;/a&gt; labelled it as overly sophisticated and too costly, defense analysists have said that miscalculations of the DGA's offer price and hesitations over financing were detrimental to the negotiations.\nIn February 2009, France offered Rafales to Oman to replace its ageing fleet of &lt;a href=\"SEPECAT%20Jaguar\"&gt;SEPECAT Jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s. In December 2012, Oman placed an order for 12 Typhoons."
