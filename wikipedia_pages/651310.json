    "text": "The commanding officer (CO) or sometimes, if the incumbent is a &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;general officer&lt;/a&gt;, commanding general (CG), is the officer in &lt;a href=\"Command%20and%20control\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Military%20organization\"&gt;military unit&lt;/a&gt;. The commanding officer has ultimate authority over the unit, and is usually given wide latitude to run the unit as they see fit, within the bounds of &lt;a href=\"military%20law\"&gt;military law&lt;/a&gt;. In this respect, commanding officers have significant responsibilities (for example, the use of force, finances, equipment, the &lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Conventions\"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;), duties (to higher authority, mission effectiveness, &lt;a href=\"duty%20of%20care\"&gt;duty of care&lt;/a&gt; to personnel), and powers (for example, discipline and &lt;a href=\"punishment\"&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; of personnel within certain limits of military law).\nIn some countries, commanding officers may be of any commissioned rank. Usually, there are more officers than command positions available, and time spent in command is generally a key aspect of promotion, so the role of commanding officer is highly valued. The commanding officer is often assisted by an &lt;a href=\"executive%20officer\"&gt;executive officer&lt;/a&gt; (XO) or &lt;a href=\"second-in-command\"&gt;second-in-command&lt;/a&gt; (2i/c), who handles personnel and day-to-day matters, and a &lt;a href=\"senior%20enlisted%20advisor\"&gt;senior enlisted advisor&lt;/a&gt;. Larger units may also have &lt;a href=\"Staff%20%28military%29\"&gt;staff officers&lt;/a&gt; responsible for various responsibilities.\nCommonwealth.\nArmy.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Marines\"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt;, and many other &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; military and &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; organisations, the commanding officer of a unit is appointed. Thus the office of CO is an appointment.\nThe appointment of commanding officer is exclusive to commanders of major units (&lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s and similar sized units). It is customary for a commanding officer to hold the rank of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;, and they are usually referred to within the unit simply as \"the colonel\" or the CO. \"The colonel\" may also refer to the holder of an honorary appointment of a senior officer who oversees the non-operational affairs of a regiment. However, the rank of the appointment holder and the holder's appointment are separate. That is, not all lieutenant colonels are COs, and although most COs are lieutenant colonels, that is not a requirement of the appointment.\nSub-units and minor units (&lt;a href=\"company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28army%29\"&gt;squadrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"artillery%20battery\"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;) and formations (brigades, divisions, corps and armies) do not have a commanding officer. The officer in command of a minor unit holds the appointment of \"&lt;a href=\"officer%20commanding\"&gt;officer commanding&lt;/a&gt;\" (OC). Higher formations have a commander (usual for a brigade) or a &lt;a href=\"general%20officer%20commanding\"&gt;general officer commanding&lt;/a&gt; (GOC). Area commands have a commander-in-chief (e.g. C-in-C Land Army, C-in-C British Army of the Rhine). The OC of a sub-unit or minor unit is today customarily a &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; (although formerly usually a &lt;a href=\"captain\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; in infantry companies and often also in cavalry squadrons), although again the rank of the appointment holder and the holder's appointment are separate and independent of each other.\nIn some cases, independent units smaller than a sub-unit (e.g. a military police platoon that reports directly to a formation such as a brigade) will also have an OC appointed. In these cases, the officer commanding can be a captain or even a lieutenant.\nAppointments such as CO and OC may have specific powers associated with them. For example, they may have statutory powers to promote soldiers or to deal with certain disciplinary offences and award certain punishments. The CO of a unit may have the power to sentence an offender to 28 days' detention, whereas the OC of a sub-unit may have the power to sentence an offender to 3 days' restriction of privileges.\nCommanders of units smaller than sub-units (e.g. &lt;a href=\"platoon\"&gt;platoon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troop\"&gt;troop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Section%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;s) are not specific appointments and officers or NCOs who fill those positions are simply referred to as the commander or leader (e.g. platoon commander, troop leader, section commander/leader, etc.).\nRoyal Air Force.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the title of commanding officer is reserved for station commanders or commanders of independent units, including flying squadrons. As with the British Army, the post of a commander of a lesser unit such as an administrative &lt;a href=\"Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flight%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;flight&lt;/a&gt; is referred to as the officer commanding (OC).\nRoyal Navy.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; and many others, commanding officer is the official title of the commander of any ship, unit or installation. However, they are referred to as \"the captain\" no matter what their actual rank, or informally as &lt;a href=\"Skipper%20%28boating%29\"&gt;\"skipper\"&lt;/a&gt; or even \"boss\".\nUnited States.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the status of commanding officer is duly applied to all commissioned officers who hold lawful command over a military unit, ship, or installation.\nArmy.\nThe commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, usually a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"company%20commander\"&gt;company commander&lt;/a&gt; (or the &lt;a href=\"Artillery%20battery\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt;/troop commander for &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt;) units. The commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28army%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry/armored cavalry&lt;/a&gt;) is usually a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;. The commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"brigade%20commander\"&gt;brigade commander&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; level and higher, however, the commanding officer is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;commanding general&lt;/a&gt;, as these officers hold &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;general officer&lt;/a&gt; rank.\nAlthough holding a leadership position in the same sense as commanders, the individual in charge of a &lt;a href=\"platoon\"&gt;platoon&lt;/a&gt;, the smallest unit of soldiers led by a &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;, typically a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"platoon%20leader\"&gt;platoon leader&lt;/a&gt;, not the platoon commander. This officer does have command of the soldiers under him but does not have many of the command responsibilities inherent to higher echelons. For example, a platoon leader cannot issue &lt;a href=\"non-judicial%20punishment\"&gt;non-judicial punishment&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Non-commissioned%20officers\"&gt;Non-commissioned officers&lt;/a&gt; may be said to \"have charge of\" certain smaller military units. They cannot, however, hold \"command\" as they lack the requisite authority granted by the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Those wielding \"command\" of individual vehicles (and their crews) are called vehicle commanders. This distinction in title also applies to officers who are aircraft commanders (\"pilot in command\"), as well as officers and enlisted soldiers who are tank and armored vehicle commanders. While these officers and NCOs have tactical and operational command (including full authority, responsibility, and accountability \u2013 especially in the case of aircraft commanders) of the soldiers and equipment in their charge, they are not accorded the legal authority of a \"commanding officer\" under the UCMJ or military regulations.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrant%20officer%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Warrant officers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;United States Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; are single career-track officers that can, and occasionally do, hold command positions within certain specialty units, i.e. &lt;a href=\"Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29\"&gt;Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Aviation%20Branch\"&gt;Army Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. However, warrant officers usually do not command if a commissioned officer is present; normally they serve as &lt;a href=\"executive%20officer\"&gt;executive officer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"second-in-command\"&gt;2IC&lt;/a&gt;).\nMarine Corps.\nThe commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"company%20%28military%20unit%29%23Marine%20Corps\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, usually a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"company%20commander\"&gt;company commander&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Artillery%20battery%23United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt; commander (for &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20battalions%23artillery%20battalions\"&gt;field artillery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20battalions%23low%20altitude%20air%20defense%20battalions\"&gt;low altitude air defense units&lt;/a&gt;). The commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"Battalion%23United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Aviation%23Squadrons\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Aviation\"&gt;Marine aviation&lt;/a&gt;), is usually a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;. The commanding officer of a &lt;a href=\"Regiment%23United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Aviation%23Groups\"&gt;aviation group&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Marine%20air-ground%20task%20force%23Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit%20%28MEU%29\"&gt;Marine Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; (MEU), a &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;, is the regimental/group/MEU commander. At the &lt;a href=\"Marine%20air-ground%20task%20force%23Marine%20Expeditionary%20Brigade%20%28MEB%29\"&gt;Marine Expeditionary Brigade&lt;/a&gt; (MEB), &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20logistics%20groups\"&gt;Marine Logistics Group&lt;/a&gt; (MLG), &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20divisions\"&gt;Marine Division&lt;/a&gt; (MARDIV), &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Aviation%23Wings\"&gt;Marine Aircraft Wing&lt;/a&gt; (MAW), &lt;a href=\"Marine%20air-ground%20task%20force%23Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28MEF%29\"&gt;Marine Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; (MEF), and &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Marine%20Force\"&gt;Fleet Marine Force&lt;/a&gt; (FMF) levels; however, the commanding officer is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;commanding general&lt;/a&gt;, as these officers hold &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;general officer&lt;/a&gt; rank.\nThe officer in charge of a &lt;a href=\"platoon\"&gt;platoon&lt;/a&gt;, the smallest tactical unit of Marines usually led by a &lt;a href=\"commissioned%20officer\"&gt;commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;, typically a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;first or second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"platoon%20commander\"&gt;platoon commander&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction in title also applies to officers who are aircraft commanders, as well as officers, staff non-commissioned officers (staff sergeant \u2013 master sergeant), and non-commissioned officers (corporal and sergeant) who are tank and armored vehicle commanders. While these officers, SNCOs, and NCOs have tactical and operational command (including full authority, responsibility, and accountability\u2014especially in the case of aircraft commanders) of the Marines and equipment in their charge, they are not accorded the legal authority of a \"commanding officer\" under the UCMJ or military regulations.\nNavy.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, commanding officer is the official title of the commander of a ship, but they are usually referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20captain\"&gt;the Captain&lt;/a&gt;\" regardless of their actual rank: \"Any naval officer who commands a ship, submarine or other vessel is addressed by naval custom as \"captain\" while aboard in command, regardless of their actual rank.\" They may be informally referred to as \"Skipper\", though allowing or forbidding the use of this form of address is the commanding officer's prerogative.\nA prospective commanding officer (PCO) is a U.S. Navy officer who has been selected for his/her own command. The term is used in correspondence or in reference to the officer before they assume command of the unit (ship, squadron, unit, etc.). The novel \"Surface and Destroy\" by Michael Sturma has detailed accounts of PCOs and their experience in unrestricted submarine warfare.\nAir Force.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the commanding officer of a unit is similarly referred to as the unit commander, such as &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; commander, &lt;a href=\"Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; commander, &lt;a href=\"Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt; commander, and so forth. Squadron commanders (the base unit of the United States Air Force) are usually majors or lieutenant colonels. Group commanders (made up of two or more squadrons) are usually colonels, while wing commanders may be colonels (typical wings) or generals (larger wings)."
