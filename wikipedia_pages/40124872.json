    "text": "The American College of Parliamentary Lawyers (ACPL) is a &lt;a href=\"professional%20association\"&gt;professional association&lt;/a&gt; of lawyers from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounded in 2007, the College states that one of its purposes is \"to provide a forum for the exchange of information among experienced legal professionals for the purpose of the advancement of parliamentary law\". This organization also advocates the use of &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20procedure\"&gt;parliamentary procedure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Voluntary%20association\"&gt;voluntary organizations&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Parliamentary law\" (i.e. the procedures used by &lt;a href=\"Deliberative%20assembly\"&gt;deliberative assemblies&lt;/a&gt; to make decisions in &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29\"&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt;) is separate from the &lt;a href=\"Law\"&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; matters that lawyers are trained in. Generally, lawyers are not necessarily also &lt;a href=\"Parliamentarian%20%28consultant%29\"&gt;parliamentarians&lt;/a&gt;, or experts in meeting procedures. As a result, this association was formed to connect the two fields. Only individuals who are both lawyers and parliamentarians could be members in this organization.\nFor its meetings, ACPL uses &lt;a href=\"Robert%27s%20Rules%20of%20Order\"&gt;Robert's Rules of Order&lt;/a&gt; Newly Revised (RONR) to conduct its business.\nExternal links.\nWebsite https://www.parliamentarylawyers.org/"
