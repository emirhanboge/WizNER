    "text": "The history of Slovenia chronicles the period of the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Lands\"&gt;Slovenian territory&lt;/a&gt; from the 5th century BC to the present. In the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Early Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;, Proto-&lt;a href=\"Illyrians\"&gt;Illyrian&lt;/a&gt; tribes settled an area stretching from present-day &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; to the city of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;. The Slovenian territory was part of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and it was devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt;'s incursions during &lt;a href=\"late%20Antiquity\"&gt;late Antiquity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. The main route from the &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20plain\"&gt;Pannonian plain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Italy%20%28Roman%20Empire%29\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; ran through present-day Slovenia. &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Slavs\"&gt;Alpine Slavs&lt;/a&gt;, ancestors of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Slovenians\"&gt;Slovenians&lt;/a&gt;, settled the area in the late 6th Century AD. The &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; controlled the land for nearly 1,000 years, and between the mid-14th century and 1918 most of Slovenia was under &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; rule. In 1918, Slovenes formed &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croats&lt;/a&gt;, while a minority came under &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. The state of Slovenia was created in 1945 as part of &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;federal Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. Slovenia gained its independence from &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in June 1991, and is today a member of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrehistory to Slavic settlement.\nPrehistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"last%20glacial%20period\"&gt;last glacial period&lt;/a&gt;, present-day Slovenia was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Neanderthal\"&gt;Neanderthal&lt;/a&gt;s; the best-known Neanderthal archaeological site in Slovenia is a cave close to the village of &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0ebrelje\"&gt;\u0160ebrelje&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cerkno\"&gt;Cerkno&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Divje%20Babe%20Flute\"&gt;Divje Babe Flute&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest known musical instrument in the world, was found in 1995. The world's oldest securely dated wooden &lt;a href=\"wheel%20and%20axle\"&gt;wheel and axle&lt;/a&gt; was found near the &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20Marshes\"&gt;Ljubljana Marshes&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. In the transition period between the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Urnfield%20culture\"&gt;Urnfield culture&lt;/a&gt; flourished. Numerous archeological remains dating from the &lt;a href=\"Hallstatt%20period\"&gt;Hallstatt period&lt;/a&gt; have been found in Slovenia, with important settlements in &lt;a href=\"Most%20na%20So%C4%8Di\"&gt;Most na So\u010di&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Va%C4%8De\"&gt;Va\u010de&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0entvid%20pri%20Sti%C4%8Dni\"&gt;\u0160entvid pri Sti\u010dni&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Novo%20Mesto\"&gt;Novo Mesto&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Carniola\"&gt;Lower Carniola&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most important archaeological sites of the Hallstatt culture, has been nicknamed the \"City of Situlas\" after numerous &lt;a href=\"situla\"&gt;situla&lt;/a&gt;s found in the area.\nAncient Romans.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;, present-day Slovenia was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Illyrians\"&gt;Illyrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; tribes until the 1st century BC, when the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt; conquered the region establishing the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Pannonia\"&gt;Pannonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noricum\"&gt;Noricum&lt;/a&gt;. What is now western Slovenia was included directly under &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Italy\"&gt;Roman Italia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the X region \"Venetia et Histria\". Important Roman towns located in present-day Slovenia included &lt;a href=\"Emona\"&gt;Emona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celeia\"&gt;Celeia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poetovio\"&gt;Poetovio&lt;/a&gt;. Other important settlements were &lt;a href=\"Nauportus\"&gt;Nauportus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neviodunum\"&gt;Neviodunum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haliaetum\"&gt;Haliaetum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atrans\"&gt;Atrans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stridon\"&gt;Stridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt;, the region suffered invasions of many barbarian armies, due to its strategic position as the main passage from the &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20Plain\"&gt;Pannonian Plain&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Italian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Rome finally abandoned the region at the end of the 4th century. Most cities were destroyed, while the remaining local population moved to the highland areas, establishing fortified towns. In the 5th century, the region was part of the &lt;a href=\"Ostrogothic%20Kingdom\"&gt;Ostrogothic Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and was later contested between the &lt;a href=\"Ostrogoths\"&gt;Ostrogoths&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlavic settlement.\nThe Slavic ancestors of present-day &lt;a href=\"Slovenes\"&gt;Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; settled in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Alps\"&gt;East Alpine&lt;/a&gt; area at the end of the 6th century. Coming from two directions, North (via today's East Austria and Czech Republic), settling in the area of today's Carinthia and west Styria, and South (via today's Slavonia), settling in the area of today's central Slovenia.\nKing Samo.\nThis Slavic tribe, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Slavs\"&gt;Alpine Slavs&lt;/a&gt;, was submitted to &lt;a href=\"Pannonian%20Avars\"&gt;Avar&lt;/a&gt; rule before joining the Slavic King &lt;a href=\"Samo\"&gt;Samo&lt;/a&gt;'s tribal union in 623 AD. After Samo's death, the Slavs of &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt; (in present-day Slovenia) again fell to Avar rule, while the Slavs north of the &lt;a href=\"Karavanke\"&gt;Karavanke&lt;/a&gt; range (in present-day Austrian regions of &lt;a href=\"Carinthia\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Styria\"&gt;Styria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Tyrol\"&gt;East Tyrol&lt;/a&gt;) established the independent principality of &lt;a href=\"Carantania\"&gt;Carantania&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiddle Ages.\nCarantania to Carinthia.\nIn 745, Carantania and the rest of Slavic-populated territories of present-day Slovenia, being pressured by newly consolidated Avar power, submitted to Bavarian overrule and were, together with the Duchy of Bavaria, incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Empire\"&gt;Carolingian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Carantanians\"&gt;Carantanians&lt;/a&gt; and other Slavs living in present Slovenia &lt;a href=\"christianization\"&gt;converted to Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern part of Carantania was ruled again by Avars between 745 and 795.\nCarantania retained its internal independence until 818 when the local princes, following the anti-&lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Ljudevit%20Posavski\"&gt;Ljudevit Posavski&lt;/a&gt;, were deposed and gradually replaced by a Germanic (primarily &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;n) ascendancy. Under Emperor &lt;a href=\"Arnulf%20of%20Carinthia\"&gt;Arnulf of Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, Carantania, now ruled by a mixed Bavarian-Slav nobility, briefly emerged as a regional power, but was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20people\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; invasions in the late 9th century.\nCarantania-Carinthia was established again as an autonomous administrative unit in 976, when Emperor Otto I, \"the Great\", after deposing the Duke of Bavaria, Henry II, \"the Quarreller\", split the lands held by him and made &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Carinthia\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt; the sixth duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, but old Carantania never developed into a unified realm.\nIn the late 10th and beginning of the 11th century, primarily because of the Hungarian threat, the south-eastern border region of the German Empire was organized into so called &lt;a href=\"March%20%28territory%29\"&gt;\"marks\"&lt;/a&gt;, that became the core of the development of the historical Slovenian lands, the Carniola, the Styria and the western Gori\u0161ka/Gorizia. The consolidation and formation of the historical Slovenian lands took place in a long period between 11th and 14th century being led by a number of important feudal families such as the &lt;a href=\"Bernhard%20von%20Spanheim\"&gt;Dukes of Spanheim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Meinhardiner\"&gt;Counts of Gorizia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Celje\"&gt;Counts of Celje&lt;/a&gt; and finally the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;House of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlovenes as a distinct ethnic group.\nThe first mentions of a common Slovene ethnic identity, transcending regional boundaries, date from the 16th century.\nDuring the 14th century, most of the Slovene Lands passed under the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; rule. In the 15th century, the Habsburg domination was challenged by the &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Celje\"&gt;Counts of Celje&lt;/a&gt;, but by the end of the century the great majority of Slovene-inhabited territories were incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. Most Slovenes lived in the administrative region known as &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Austria\"&gt;Inner Austria&lt;/a&gt;, forming the majority of the population of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Carniola\"&gt;Duchy of Carniola&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Gorizia%20and%20Gradisca\"&gt;County of Gorizia and Gradisca&lt;/a&gt;, as well as of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Styria\"&gt;Lower Styria&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Carinthia\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlovenes also inhabited most of the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Free%20City\"&gt;Imperial Free City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;, although representing the minority of its population.\nEarly modern period.\nIn the 16th century, the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the Slovene Lands. During this period, the first books in Slovene were written by the &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; preacher &lt;a href=\"Primo%C5%BE%20Trubar\"&gt;Primo\u017e Trubar&lt;/a&gt; and his followers, establishing the base for the development of standard Slovene. In the second half of the 16th century, numerous books were printed in Slovene, including an integral translation of the Bible by &lt;a href=\"Jurij%20Dalmatin\"&gt;Jurij Dalmatin&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt; in the late 16th and 17th centuries, led by the bishop of Ljubljana &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Chr%C3%B6n\"&gt;Thomas Chr\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; and Seckau , almost all Protestants were expelled from the Slovene Lands (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Prekmurje\"&gt;Prekmurje&lt;/a&gt;). Nevertheless, they left a strong legacy in the tradition of Slovene culture, which was partially incorporated in the Catholic &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt; in the 17th century. The &lt;a href=\"Bohori%C4%8D%20alphabet\"&gt;old Slovene orthography&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Bohori%C4%8D\"&gt;Bohori\u010d&lt;/a&gt;'s alphabet, which was developed by the Protestants in the 16th century and remained in use until the mid-19th century, testified to the unbroken tradition of Slovene culture as established in the years of the Protestant Reformation.\nBetween the 15th and the 17th centuries, the Slovene Lands suffered many calamities. Many areas, especially in southern Slovenia, were devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg%20wars\"&gt;Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars&lt;/a&gt;. Many flourishing towns, like &lt;a href=\"Vipavski%20Kri%C5%BE\"&gt;Vipavski Kri\u017e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kostanjevica%20na%20Krki\"&gt;Kostanjevica na Krki&lt;/a&gt;, were completely destroyed by incursions of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Army\"&gt;Ottoman Army&lt;/a&gt;, and never recovered. The nobility of the Slovene-inhabited provinces had an important role in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;n noblemen's army thus defeated the Ottomans in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sisak\"&gt;Battle of Sisak&lt;/a&gt; of 1593, marking the end of the immediate Ottoman threat to the Slovene Lands, although sporadic Ottoman incursions continued well into the 17th century.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the western Slovene regions became the battlefield of the wars between the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20Republic\"&gt;Venetian Republic&lt;/a&gt;, most notably the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Gradisca\"&gt;War of Gradisca&lt;/a&gt;, which was largely fought in the Slovene &lt;a href=\"Gori%C5%A1ka\"&gt;Gori\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt; region. Between the late 15th and early 18th centuries, the Slovene lands also witnessed many peasant wars, the best-known being the &lt;a href=\"Carinthian%20Peasant%20Revolt\"&gt;Carinthian Peasant Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1478, the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Peasant%20Revolt\"&gt;Slovene Peasant Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1515, the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%E2%80%93Slovene%20Peasant%20Revolt\"&gt;Croatian\u2013Slovene Peasant Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1573, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Slovene%20Peasant%20Revolt\"&gt;Second Slovene Peasant Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1635, and the &lt;a href=\"Tolmin%20Peasant%20Revolt\"&gt;Tolmin Peasant Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of 1713.\nThe late 17th century was also marked by a vivid intellectual and artistic activity. Many &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Baroque\"&gt;Italian Baroque&lt;/a&gt; artists, mostly architects and musicians, settled in the Slovene Lands, and contributed greatly to the development of the local culture. Artists like &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Robba\"&gt;Francesco Robba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Pozzo\"&gt;Andrea Pozzo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vittore%20Carpaccio\"&gt;Vittore Carpaccio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giulio%20Quaglio%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Giulio Quaglio&lt;/a&gt; worked in the Slovenian territory, while scientists such as &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Weikhard%20von%20Valvasor\"&gt;Johann Weikhard von Valvasor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Gregorius%20Thalnitscher\"&gt;Johannes Gregorius Thalnitscher&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the development of the scholarly activities. By the early 18th century, however, the region entered another period of stagnation, which was slowly overcome only by the mid-18th century.\nAge of Enlightenment to the national movement.\nBetween the early 18th century and early 19th century, the Slovene lands experienced a period of peace, with a moderate economic recovery starting from mid-18th century onward. The &lt;a href=\"Adriatic\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; was declared a &lt;a href=\"free%20port\"&gt;free port&lt;/a&gt; in 1718, boosting the economic activity throughout the western parts of the Slovene Lands. The political, administrative and economic reforms of the Habsburg rulers &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Maria Theresa of Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Joseph II&lt;/a&gt; improved the economic situation of the peasantry, and were well received by the emerging bourgeoisie, which was however still weak.\nIn the late 18th century, a process of &lt;a href=\"Standard%20language\"&gt;standardarization&lt;/a&gt; of Slovene began, promoted by &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;n clergymen like &lt;a href=\"Marko%20Pohlin\"&gt;Marko Pohlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jurij%20Japelj\"&gt;Jurij Japelj&lt;/a&gt;. During the same period, peasant-writers began using and promoting the Slovene &lt;a href=\"vernacular\"&gt;vernacular&lt;/a&gt; in the countryside. This popular movement, known as \"&lt;a href=\"bukovnik\"&gt;bukovnik&lt;/a&gt;i\", started among &lt;a href=\"Carinthian%20Slovenes\"&gt;Carinthian Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; as part a wider revival of Slovene literature. The Slovene cultural tradition was strongly reinforced in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; period in the 18th century by the endeavours of the &lt;a href=\"Sigmund%20Zois\"&gt;Zois Circle&lt;/a&gt;. After two centuries of stagnation, &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20literature\"&gt;Slovene literature&lt;/a&gt; emerged again, most notably in the works of the playwright &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Toma%C5%BE%20Linhart\"&gt;Anton Toma\u017e Linhart&lt;/a&gt; and the poet &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20Vodnik\"&gt;Valentin Vodnik&lt;/a&gt;. However, German remained the main language of culture, administration and education well into the 19th century.\nBetween 1805 and 1813, the Slovene-settled territory was part of the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20Provinces\"&gt;Illyrian Provinces&lt;/a&gt;, an autonomous province of the Napoleonic &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of which was established at &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;. Although the French rule in the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20Provinces\"&gt;Illyrian Provinces&lt;/a&gt; was short-lived it significantly contributed to greater national self-confidence and awareness of freedoms. The French did not entirely abolish the &lt;a href=\"feudal%20system\"&gt;feudal system&lt;/a&gt;, their rule familiarised in more detail the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20Provinces\"&gt;Illyrian Provinces&lt;/a&gt; with the achievements of the &lt;a href=\"French%20revolution\"&gt;French revolution&lt;/a&gt; and with contemporary &lt;a href=\"bourgeois%20society\"&gt;bourgeois society&lt;/a&gt;. They introduced equality before the law, compulsory &lt;a href=\"military%20service\"&gt;military service&lt;/a&gt; for men and a uniform tax system, and also abolished certain tax privileges, introduced modern administration, separated powers between the state and the Church, and nationalised the judiciary.\nIn August 1813, Austria declared war on France. Austrian troops led by General &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Tomassich\"&gt;Franz Tomassich&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Illyrian Provinces. After this short &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French interim&lt;/a&gt; all Slovene Lands were, once again, included in the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Slowly, a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed, and the quest for a political unification of all Slovenes became widespread. In the 1820s and 1840s, the interest in Slovene language and folklore grew enormously, with numerous philologists collecting folk songs and advancing the first steps towards a standardization of the language. A small number of Slovene activist, mostly from &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Styria\"&gt;Styria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carinthia%20%28duchy%29\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, embraced the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20movement\"&gt;Illyrian movement&lt;/a&gt; that started in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and aimed at uniting all South Slavic peoples. &lt;a href=\"Pan-Slavic\"&gt;Pan-Slavic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austro-Slavism\"&gt;Austro-Slavic&lt;/a&gt; ideas also gained importance. However, the intellectual circle around the philologist &lt;a href=\"Matija%20%C4%8Cop\"&gt;Matija \u010cop&lt;/a&gt; and the Romantic poet &lt;a href=\"France%20Pre%C5%A1eren\"&gt;France Pre\u0161eren&lt;/a&gt; was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality, refusing the idea of merging the Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation.\nIn 1848, a mass political and popular movement for the &lt;a href=\"United%20Slovenia\"&gt;United Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; (\"\") emerged as part of the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;Spring of Nations&lt;/a&gt; movement within the Austrian Empire. Slovene activists demanded a unification of all Slovene-speaking territories in a unified and autonomous Slovene kingdom within the Austrian Empire. Although the project failed, it served as an almost undisputed platform of Slovene political activity in the following decades.\nClashing nationalisms in the late 19th century.\nBetween 1848 and 1918, numerous institutions (including theatres and publishing houses, as well as political, financial and cultural organisations) were founded in the so-called &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20National%20Awakening\"&gt;Slovene National Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their political and institutional fragmentation and lack of proper political representation, the Slovenes were able to establish a functioning national infrastructure.\nWith the introduction of a constitution granting civil and political liberties in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the Slovene national movement gained force. Despite its internal differentiation among the conservative &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slovenes\"&gt;Old Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; and the progressive &lt;a href=\"Young%20Slovenes\"&gt;Young Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;, the Slovene nationals defended similar programs, calling for a cultural and political autonomy of the Slovene people. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, a series of mass rallies called \"&lt;a href=\"Tabori%20rallies\"&gt;tabori&lt;/a&gt;\", modeled on the Irish &lt;a href=\"monster%20meetings\"&gt;monster meetings&lt;/a&gt;, were organized in support of the United Slovenia program. These rallies, attended by thousands of people, proved the allegiance of wider strata of the Slovene population to the ideas of national emancipation.\nBy the end of the 19th century, Slovenes had established a standardized language, and a thriving civil society. Literacy levels were among the highest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and numerous national associations were present at grassroots level. The idea of a common political entity of all &lt;a href=\"South%20Slavs\"&gt;South Slavs&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, emerged.\nSince the 1880s, a fierce &lt;a href=\"culture%20war\"&gt;culture war&lt;/a&gt; between Catholic traditionalists and &lt;a href=\"integralism\"&gt;integralists&lt;/a&gt; on one side, and liberals, progressivists and &lt;a href=\"Anticlericalism\"&gt;anticlericals&lt;/a&gt; dominated Slovene political and public life, especially in &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;. During the same period, the growth of industrialization intensified social tensions. Both &lt;a href=\"Socialist\"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20socialist\"&gt;Christian socialist&lt;/a&gt; movements mobilized the masses. In 1905, the first Socialist mayor in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was elected in the Slovene mining town of &lt;a href=\"Idrija\"&gt;Idrija&lt;/a&gt; on the list of the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Yugoslav Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. In the same years, the Christian socialist activist &lt;a href=\"Janez%20Evangelist%20Krek\"&gt;Janez Evangelist Krek&lt;/a&gt; organized hundreds of workers and agricultural &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the Slovene countryside.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, national struggles in ethnically mixed areas (especially in &lt;a href=\"Carinthia%20%28duchy%29\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Styria\"&gt;Lower Styria&lt;/a&gt;n towns) dominated the political and social lives of the citizenry. By the 1910s, the national struggles between Slovene and Italian speakers in the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Littoral\"&gt;Austrian Littoral&lt;/a&gt;, and Slovene and German speakers, overshadowed other political conflicts and brought about a nationalist radicalization on both sides.\nIn the last two decades before World War One, Slovene arts and literature experienced one of its most flourishing periods, with numerous talented modernist authors, painters and architects. The most important authors of this period were &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Cankar\"&gt;Ivan Cankar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oton%20%C5%BDupan%C4%8Di%C4%8D\"&gt;Oton \u017dupan\u010di\u010d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragotin%20Kette\"&gt;Dragotin Kette&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Grohar\"&gt;Ivan Grohar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rihard%20Jakopi%C4%8D\"&gt;Rihard Jakopi\u010d&lt;/a&gt; were among the most talented Slovene visual artists of the time.\n After the &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20earthquake\"&gt;Ljubljana earthquake&lt;/a&gt; of 1895, the city experienced a rapid modernization under the charismatic &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20nationalism\"&gt;Liberal nationalist&lt;/a&gt; mayors &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Hribar\"&gt;Ivan Hribar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Tav%C4%8Dar\"&gt;Ivan Tav\u010dar&lt;/a&gt;. Architects like &lt;a href=\"Max%20Fabiani\"&gt;Max Fabiani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ciril%20Metod%20Koch\"&gt;Ciril Metod Koch&lt;/a&gt; introduced their own version of the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20Secession\"&gt;Vienna Secession&lt;/a&gt; architecture to Ljubljana. In the same period, the Adriatic port of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; became an increasingly important center of Slovene economy, culture and politics. By 1910, around a third of the city population was Slovene, and the number of Slovenes in Trieste was higher than in Ljubljana.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Slovenes emigrated to other countries, mostly to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, but also to &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and to larger cities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, especially &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. It has been calculated that around 300,000 Slovenes emigrated between 1880 and 1910, which means that one in six Slovenes left their homeland.\nEmigration.\nThe period between the 1880s and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; saw a mass emigration from the present-day Slovenia to America. The largest group of Slovenes eventually settled in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and the surrounding area. The second-largest group settled in Chicago, principally on the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20West%20Side%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;Lower West Side&lt;/a&gt;. Many Slovene immigrants went to southwestern Pennsylvania, southeastern Ohio and the state of &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; to work in the coal mines and lumber industry. Some also went to the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Youngstown%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Youngstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; areas, to work in the steel mills, as well as &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Range\"&gt;Iron Range&lt;/a&gt;, to work in the iron mines.\nDuring the First World War, which severely affected Slovenia in particular with the bloody soviet front and the politics of the great powers that threatened to dismantle the Slovene territory between several countries (the London Agreement, 1915), Slovenes have already tried to regulate their national position in the common state unit Croats and Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy. The demand, known as the May Declaration, was given by the Slovene, Croatian and Serbian parliamentarians in the Vienna Parliament in the spring of 1917. The ruling circles of the Habsburg monarchy initially rejected the request, and subsequent government initiatives for the federalisation of the monarchy (for example, the October manifesto of Emperor Charles) was rejected by most Slovenian politicians, which has already leaned towards independence. The preservation of the reformed state was longest defended by the former head of the Slovenian People's Party and the last Provincial Commander-in-Chief of Carniola, Ivan \u0160uster\u0161i\u010d, who had few supporters and influence.\nMerging into the Yugoslav state and struggle for the border areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20People%27s%20Party%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Slovene People's Party&lt;/a&gt; launched a movement for self-determination, demanding the creation of a semi-independent South Slavic state under &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20dynasty\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the &lt;a href=\"May%20Declaration%20%281917%29\"&gt;Declaration Movement&lt;/a&gt;, followed. By early 1918, more than 200,000 signatures were collected in favor of the Slovene People Party's proposal.\nDuring the War, some 500 Slovenes served as volunteers in the Serbian army, while a smaller group led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Ljudevit%20Pivko\"&gt;Ljudevit Pivko&lt;/a&gt;, served as volunteers in the Italian Army. In the final year of the war, many predominantly Slovene regiments in the Austro-Hungarian Army staged a mutiny against their military leadership; the best-known mutiny of Slovene soldiers was the &lt;a href=\"Judenburg%20Rebellion\"&gt;Judenburg Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in May 1918.\nFollowing the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs\"&gt;National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs&lt;/a&gt; took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918. On 29 October independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs\"&gt;State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the new &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;, itself being renamed in 1929 to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlovenes whose territory fell under the rule of neighboring states Italy, Austria and Hungary, were subjected to policies of &lt;a href=\"cultural%20assimilation\"&gt;assimilation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorder with Austria.\nAfter the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in late 1918, an &lt;a href=\"Austrian-Slovene%20clashes%20in%20Carinthia\"&gt;armed dispute started&lt;/a&gt; between the Slovenes and &lt;a href=\"German%20Austria\"&gt;German Austria&lt;/a&gt; for the regions of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Styria\"&gt;Lower Styria&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Carinthia\"&gt;Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1918, &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Maister\"&gt;Rudolf Maister&lt;/a&gt; seized the city of &lt;a href=\"Maribor\"&gt;Maribor&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas of Lower Styria in the name of the newly formed Yugoslav state. The Austrian government of Styria refrained from military intervention and also opposed a referendum, knowing that the vast majority of Lower Styria was ethnically Slovenian. Maribor and Lower Styria were awarded to Yugoslavia in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29\"&gt;Treaty of Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the same time, a group of volunteers led by &lt;a href=\"Franjo%20Malgaj\"&gt;Franjo Malgaj&lt;/a&gt; attempted to take control of southern Carinthia. Fighting in Carinthia lasted between December 1918 and June 1919, when the Slovene volunteers and the regular Serbian Army managed to occupy the city of &lt;a href=\"Klagenfurt\"&gt;Klagenfurt&lt;/a&gt;. In compliance with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29\"&gt;Treaty of Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt;, the Yugoslav forces had to withdraw from Klagenfurt, while a referendum was to be held in other areas of southern Carinthia. In October 1920, the majority of the population of southern Carinthia &lt;a href=\"Carinthian%20Plebiscite\"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; to remain in Austria, and only a small portion of the province (around &lt;a href=\"Dravograd\"&gt;Dravograd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravne%20na%20Koro%C5%A1kem\"&gt;Gu\u0161tanj&lt;/a&gt;) was awarded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. With the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Trianon\"&gt;Treaty of Trianon&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the Slovene-inhabited &lt;a href=\"Prekmurje\"&gt;Prekmurje&lt;/a&gt; region, which had belonged to &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; since the 10th century. \nBorder with Italy.\nIn exchange for joining the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allied Powers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, under the secret &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20London%20%281915%29\"&gt;Treaty of London (1915)&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Rapallo%20%281920%29\"&gt;Treaty of Rapallo (1920)&lt;/a&gt;, was granted rule over much of the &lt;a href=\"Slovenes\"&gt;Slovene&lt;/a&gt; territories. These included a quarter of the Slovene ethnic territory, including areas that were exclusively ethnic Slovene. The population of the affected areas was approximately 327,000 of the total population of 1.3 million Slovenes.\nKingdom of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1921, against the vote of the great majority (70%) of Slovene MPs, a centralist constitution was passed in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;. Despite it, Slovenes managed to maintain a high level of &lt;a href=\"cultural%20autonomy\"&gt;cultural autonomy&lt;/a&gt;, and both economy and the arts prospered. Slovene politicians participated in almost all Yugoslav governments, and the Slovene conservative leader &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Koro%C5%A1ec\"&gt;Anton Koro\u0161ec&lt;/a&gt; briefly served as the only non-&lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in the period between the two world wars.\nIn 1929, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was renamed to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. The constitution was abolished, civil liberties suspended, while the centralist pressure intensified. Slovenia was renamed to &lt;a href=\"Drava%20Banovina\"&gt;Drava Banovina&lt;/a&gt;. During the whole interwar period, Slovene voters strongly supported the conservative &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20People%27s%20Party%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Slovene People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, which unsuccessfully fought for the autonomy of Slovenia within a federalized Yugoslavia. In 1935, however, the Slovene People's Party joined the pro-regime &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Radical%20Community\"&gt;Yugoslav Radical Community&lt;/a&gt;, opening the space for the development of a left wing autonomist movement. In the 1930s, the economic crisis created a fertile ground for the rising of both leftist and rightist radicalisms. In 1937, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Communist Party of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; was founded as an autonomous party within the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Communist Party of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1938 and 1941, &lt;a href=\"left%20liberal\"&gt;left liberal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20left\"&gt;Christian left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agrarianism\"&gt;agrarian&lt;/a&gt; forces established close relations with members of the illegal Communist party, aiming at establishing a broad &lt;a href=\"anti-Fascist\"&gt;anti-Fascist&lt;/a&gt; coalition.\nThe main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized among others less developed parts of Yugoslavia became the main center of industrial production: in comparison to &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, for example, in Slovenia the industrial production was four times greater and even twenty-two times greater than in &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Macedonia\"&gt;Yugoslav Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interwar period brought a further industrialization in Slovenia, with a rapid economic growth in the 1920s followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the &lt;a href=\"1929%20economic%20crisis\"&gt;1929 economic crisis&lt;/a&gt;. This development however affected only certain areas, especially the &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20Basin\"&gt;Ljubljana Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Sava%20Valley\"&gt;Central Sava Valley&lt;/a&gt;, parts of &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Carinthia\"&gt;Slovenian Carinthia&lt;/a&gt;, and the urban areas around &lt;a href=\"Celje\"&gt;Celje&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maribor\"&gt;Maribor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tourism\"&gt;Tourism&lt;/a&gt; experienced a period of great expansion, with resort areas like &lt;a href=\"Bled\"&gt;Bled&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roga%C5%A1ka%20Slatina\"&gt;Roga\u0161ka Slatina&lt;/a&gt; gaining an international reputation. Elsewhere, agriculture and forestry remained the predominant economic activities. Nevertheless, Slovenia emerged as one of the most prosperous and economically dynamic areas in Yugoslavia, profiting from a large Balkan market. Arts and literature also prospered, as did architecture. The two largest Slovenian cities, Ljubljana and Maribor, underwent an extensive program of urban renewal and modernization. Architects like &lt;a href=\"Jo%C5%BEe%20Ple%C4%8Dnik\"&gt;Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Vurnik\"&gt;Ivan Vurnik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20%C5%A0ubic\"&gt;Vladimir \u0160ubic&lt;/a&gt; introduced modernist architecture to Slovenia.\nFascist Italianization of Littoral Slovenes and resistance.\nWith a secret &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20London%20%281915%29\"&gt;Treaty of London&lt;/a&gt; in 1915, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt; was promised large portions of Austrian-Hungarian territory by the &lt;a href=\"Triple%20Entente\"&gt;Triple Entente&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for joining the Entente against the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. After the Central Powers were defeated in 1918, Italy went on to annex some of the promised territories, after signing the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Rapallo%20%281920%29\"&gt;treaty of Rapallo&lt;/a&gt; with the new &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt; in 1920. However, these areas also included a &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20minority%20in%20Italy%20%281920%E2%80%931947%29\"&gt;quarter of Slovene ethnic territory&lt;/a&gt; and approximately 327.000 out of total population of 1.3 million Slovenes, were annexed by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt; The treaty left half a million Slavs (besides Slovenes also Croatians) inside Italy, while only a few hundred Italians in the fledgling Yugoslav state\".\n&lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; was at the end of 19th century de facto the largest Slovene city, having had more &lt;a href=\"Slovenes\"&gt;Slovene&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants than even &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;. After being ceded from the multi-ethnic Austria, Italian lower middle class\u2014who felt most threatened by the city's Slovene middle class\u2014sought to make Trieste \"citt\u00e0 italianissima\", committing series of attacks, led by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shirts\"&gt;Black Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, on Slovene shops, libraries, lawyer offices, and the central place of the rival community in \"&lt;a href=\"Narodni%20dom\"&gt;Narodni dom&lt;/a&gt;\". Forced &lt;a href=\"Italianization\"&gt;Italianization&lt;/a&gt; followed and by the mid-1930s, several thousand Slovenes, especially intellectuals from Trieste region, emigrated to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe present-day Slovenian municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Idrija\"&gt;Idrija&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ajdov%C5%A1%C4%8Dina\"&gt;Ajdov\u0161\u010dina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vipava%2C%20Slovenia\"&gt;Vipava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kanal%20ob%20So%C4%8Di\"&gt;Kanal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Postojna\"&gt;Postojna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pivka\"&gt;Pivka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ilirska%20Bistrica\"&gt;Ilirska Bistrica&lt;/a&gt;, were subjected to forced &lt;a href=\"Italianization\"&gt;Italianization&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20minority%20in%20Italy%20%281920-1947%29\"&gt;Slovene minority in Italy (1920-1947)&lt;/a&gt; lacked any minority protection under international or domestic law. Clashes between the Italian authorities and &lt;a href=\"Blackshirts\"&gt;Fascist squads&lt;/a&gt; on one side, and the local Slovene population on the other, started as early as 1920, culminating with the burning of the &lt;a href=\"Narodni%20dom%20%28Trieste%29\"&gt;Narodni dom&lt;/a&gt;, the Slovenian National Hall of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;. After all Slovene minority organizations in Italy had been suppressed, the &lt;a href=\"militant%20anti-fascist\"&gt;militant anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; organization &lt;a href=\"TIGR\"&gt;TIGR&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. The anti-Fascist guerrilla movement continued throughout the late 1920s and 1930s.\nWhen Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania joined the &lt;a href=\"Tripartite%20pact\"&gt;Tripartite pact&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, pressure greatly increased on Yugoslavia to join in as Hitler was trying to protect its southern flank before &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;launching the attack on the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. The signing of the Treaty of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with Germany on March 25, 1941, was followed two days later by a coup led by aviation general Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107. Regent prince Pavel was thrown out and authority was granted to young Peter. General Simovi\u0107 took over the provisional administration of the government. Thus, Yugoslavia did not seem to be reliable anymore to Hitler, and so on April 6, 1941, according to the operation Marita and without a formal declaration of war, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The attack began with the bombing of Belgrade, killing 20,000 people. The resistance of the Yugoslav royal army was only symbolic, as only half of the recruits were able to collect due to slow mobilization, and the military equipment and doctrine of Serbia from the Balkan wars and the First World War were obsolete. Thus, on April 10, German troops have already reached Zagreb and on April 12 Belgrade. The Italian army launched its attack only on April 11, when Hungary joined. At that time, the German army was already in Karlovac. The Italian army split into two parts: it penetrated the part towards both Ljubljana and beyond via Ko\u010devje, and the second part penetrated via Dalmatia. The German army also broke out of Bulgaria and with the mobilized units easily prevented the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army into the Thessaloniki front.\nShortly after the attack, the National People's Council was formed under the leadership of Marko Natla\u010den, who called for a peaceful handover of weapons and expelled the occupier. After the capitulation of the Yugoslav army, Hungary took over most of Prekmurje. In 1941, five Slovene settlements were established under the authority of NDH: Bregansko selo (now called Slovenska vas), Nova vas near Bregana (now Nova vas near Mokrice), Jesenice in Dolenjska, Obre\u017eje and \u010cedem. The territory was about 20 square kilometers, with about 800 inhabitants at that time.\nThe Italians in the beginning held a moderate policy in their occupied territory. In this way, bilingualism coincided, Italian was introduced into schools only as a teaching subject, all non-political, cultural and sports associations allowed it. In the occupied territory, composed of Ljubljana, Notranjska and Dolenjska with approximately 320,000 inhabitants, Italy established the Province of Ljubljana (Italian Provincia di Lubiana). After the first successful rebel actions of the occupants in the occupied territory, the Italian authorities changed the policy and began the program of ethnic cleansing [15]. The execution of this plot led to the expulsion of approximately 35,000 civilians, of whom in the Italian concentration camps, in 1942 and 1943, about 3500 men, women and children died of hunger and disease [16] That this was an attempt to ethnic cleansing, results not only from the very large number of people killed and displaced, but also from the statements and orders of the high Italian officers, and in particular from the content of the notorious 3C circular, signed by General Mario Roatta on March 1, 1942. ]\nThe German form of occupation was the tiniest of all three, since they banned all Slovenian newspapers, German was introduced into schools as a language, the adults were violently enrolled in the Styrian Homeland Association and the Carinthian People's Union or their armed sections. The official language has also become German. They violently took away 600 children who seemed to satisfy the criteria of the Aryan race and assigned them to the Lebensborn organization, they introduced Nazi laws, and later began to mobilize the military, which was contrary to international law, ...\nOn April 26, 1941, the Anti-Imperialist Front was set up in Ljubljana (renamed the Liberation Front) in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began an armed struggle against the occupiers. The founding groups of the Anti-Imperialist Front were: the Communist Party of Slovenia, part of the Christian Socialists, the democratic part of the Liberal Gymnastical Society Sokol and a part of the cultural workers who were unconnected. In memory of this event was determined April 27 as the day of the resistance against the occupier.\nIn Volkmerjev prehod in Maribor, on April 29, 1941, two anti-German-style young men under the leadership of Bojan Ilich burned two personal cars of the German Civil Administration. This was the first rebuffing anti-occupation campaign in occupied Slovenia, which was born out of a revolt at the trance, which was visited by Hitler during the three days before that of most of the German Germans. Nazi police arrested about 60 young men, but they soon released them because they could not prove their participation in the fire. On June 22, 1941, the main command of the Partisan forces was established and on the same day, the Secrets of the Liberation Movement OF were published. Subsequently, on November 1, 1941, the Basic Points of the OF, whose points 8 and 9 were written under the influence of the Atlantic Charter, were also published. By the signing of the Dolomite Declaration on March 1, 1943, the leading role in the Liberation Front was taken over by the Communist Party of Slovenia, which in the victorious national liberation struggle itself assumed all power.\nIn 1943, a liberated territory was formed in Ko\u010devje, where the OF organized the Ko\u010devski Choir, in which it elected the highest organ of the Slovenian state, adopted a decision on joining the Primorska Slovenia and elected a delegation for the II. sitting AVNOJ.\nAt the end of the war, the Slovene Partisan army, together with the Yugoslav Army and the Soviet Red Army, freed the entire Slovenian ethnic territory. The VOS departments under the command of the Communist Party and the Soviet model, after the end of the war, mostly performed post-war extrajudicial killings against civilian and military personnel. Up to 600 graves have been evacuated so far throughout Slovenia.\nSlovenia in Titoist Yugoslavia.\nFollowing the re-establishment of Yugoslavia at the end of World War II, Slovenia became part of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, declared on 29 November 1943. A socialist state was established, but because of the &lt;a href=\"Tito%E2%80%93Stalin%20split\"&gt;Tito\u2013Stalin split&lt;/a&gt;, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt;. In 1947, Italy ceded most of the &lt;a href=\"Julian%20March\"&gt;Julian March&lt;/a&gt; to Yugoslavia, and Slovenia thus regained the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Littoral\"&gt;Slovenian Littoral&lt;/a&gt;. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Koper\"&gt;Koper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izola\"&gt;Izola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Piran\"&gt;Piran&lt;/a&gt;, Italian-populated urban enclaves saw mass ethnic Italian and anti-Communist emigration (part of the &lt;a href=\"Istrian%20Exodus\"&gt;Istrian Exodus&lt;/a&gt;) due to the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Foibe%20massacres\"&gt;Foibe massacres&lt;/a&gt; and other revenge against them for &lt;a href=\"Italian%20war%20crimes\"&gt;Italian war crimes&lt;/a&gt; and due to their fear of Communism, which by 1947 had &lt;a href=\"nationalisation\"&gt;nationalised&lt;/a&gt; all private property.\nThe dispute over the port of &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; however remained opened until 1954, until the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Free%20Territory%20of%20Trieste\"&gt;Free Territory of Trieste&lt;/a&gt; was divided among Italy and Yugoslavia, thus giving Slovenia access to the sea. This division was ratified only in 1975 with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Osimo\"&gt;Treaty of Osimo&lt;/a&gt;, which gave a final legal sanction to Slovenia's long disputed western border. From the 1950s, the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Socialist Republic of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed a relatively wide autonomy.\nStalinist period.\nBetween 1945 and 1948, a wave of political repressions took place in Slovenia and in Yugoslavia. Thousands of people were imprisoned for their political beliefs. Several tens of thousands of Slovenes left Slovenia immediately after the war in fear of Communist persecution. Many of them settled in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, which became the core of Slovenian anti-Communist emigration. More than 50,000 more followed in the next decade, frequently for economic reasons, as well as political ones. These later waves of Slovene immigrants mostly settled in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, but also in other western countries.\nThe 1948 Tito\u2013Stalin split and aftermath.\nIn 1948, the &lt;a href=\"Tito%E2%80%93Stalin%20split\"&gt;Tito\u2013Stalin split&lt;/a&gt; took place. In the first years following the split, the political repression worsened, as it extended to Communists accused of &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinism&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of Slovenes were imprisoned in the concentration camp of &lt;a href=\"Goli%20Otok\"&gt;Goli Otok&lt;/a&gt;, together with thousands of people of other nationalities. Among the show trials that took place in Slovenia between 1945 and 1950, the most important were the &lt;a href=\"Nagode%20Trial\"&gt;Nagode Trial&lt;/a&gt; against democratic intellectuals and left liberal activists (1946) and the &lt;a href=\"Dachau%20trials%20%28Slovenia%29\"&gt;Dachau trials&lt;/a&gt; (1947\u20131949), where former inmates of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;Nazi concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; were accused of collaboration with the Nazis. Many members of the Roman Catholic clergy also suffered persecution. The case of bishop of Ljubljana &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Vovk\"&gt;Anton Vovk&lt;/a&gt;, who was doused with gasoline and set on fire by Communist activists during a pastoral visit to &lt;a href=\"Novo%20Mesto\"&gt;Novo Mesto&lt;/a&gt; in January 1952, echoed in the western press.\n1950s: heavy industrialization.\nIn the late 1950s, Slovenia was the first of the Yugoslav republics to begin a process of relative pluralization. A decade of &lt;a href=\"industrialisation\"&gt;industrialisation&lt;/a&gt; was accompanied also by a fervent cultural and literary production with many tensions between the regime and the dissident intellectuals. From the late 1950s onward, dissident circles started to be formed, mostly around short-lived independent journals, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Revija%2057\"&gt;Revija 57&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957\u20131958), which was the first independent intellectual journal in Yugoslavia and one of the first of this kind in the Communist bloc, and \"&lt;a href=\"Perspektive\"&gt;Perspektive&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960\u20131964). Among the most important critical public intellectuals in this period were the sociologist &lt;a href=\"Jo%C5%BEe%20Pu%C4%8Dnik\"&gt;Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik&lt;/a&gt;, the poet &lt;a href=\"Edvard%20Kocbek\"&gt;Edvard Kocbek&lt;/a&gt;, and the literary historian &lt;a href=\"Du%C5%A1an%20Pirjevec\"&gt;Du\u0161an Pirjevec&lt;/a&gt;.\n1960s: \"Self-management\".\nBy the late 1960s, the reformist faction gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Slovenian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, launching a series of reforms, aiming at the modernization of Slovenian society and economy. A new economic policy, known as &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20self-management\"&gt;workers self-management&lt;/a&gt; started to be implemented under the advice and supervision of the main theorist of the Yugoslav Communist Party, the Slovene &lt;a href=\"Edvard%20Kardelj\"&gt;Edvard Kardelj&lt;/a&gt;.\n1970s-1980s: \"Years of Lead\".\nIn 1973, this trend was stopped by the conservative faction of the Slovenian Communist Party, backed by the Yugoslav Federal government. A period known as the \"Years of Lead\" (Slovene: \"svin\u010dena leta\") followed. During this period, censorship and repression of the press and artists increased, while freedom of speech declined. Many people were jailed because of their political beliefs.\n1980s: Towards independence.\nIn the 1980s, Slovenia experienced a rise of cultural pluralism. Numerous grass-roots political, artistic and intellectual movements emerged, including the &lt;a href=\"Neue%20Slowenische%20Kunst\"&gt;Neue Slowenische Kunst&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20school%20of%20psychoanalysis\"&gt;Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Nova%20revija%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Nova revija&lt;/a&gt;\" intellectual circle. By the mid-1980s, a reformist fraction, led by &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Ku%C4%8Dan\"&gt;Milan Ku\u010dan&lt;/a&gt;, took control of the Slovenian Communist Party, starting a gradual reform towards a &lt;a href=\"market%20socialism\"&gt;market socialism&lt;/a&gt; and controlled &lt;a href=\"Pluralism%20%28political%20philosophy%29\"&gt;political pluralism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Yugoslav economic crisis of the 1980s increased the struggles within the Yugoslav Communist regime regarding the appropriate economic measures to be undertaken. Slovenia, which had less than 10% of overall Yugoslav population, produced around a fifth of the country's GDP and a fourth of all Yugoslav exports. The political disputes around economic measures was echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenes felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\nIn 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging &lt;a href=\"civil%20society\"&gt;civil society&lt;/a&gt; and the Communist regime culminated with the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Spring\"&gt;Slovene Spring&lt;/a&gt;. In 1987, a group of liberal intellectuals published a manifesto in the alternative \"&lt;a href=\"Nova%20revija%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Nova revija&lt;/a&gt;\" journal; in their so-called &lt;a href=\"Contributions%20for%20the%20Slovenian%20National%20Program\"&gt;Contributions for the Slovenian National Program&lt;/a&gt;, they called for democratization and a greater independence for Slovenia. Some of the articles openly contemplated Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia and the establishment of a full-fedged parliamentary democracy. The manifesto was condemned by the Communist authorities, but the authors did not suffer any direct repression, and the journal was not suppressed (although the editorial board was forced to resign). At the end of the same year, a massive strike broke out in the Litostroj manufacturing plant in &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the establishment of the first independent trade union in Yugoslavia. The leaders of the strike established an independent political organization, called the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Social Democratic Union of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterwards, in mid May 1988, an independent &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20Union%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Peasant Union of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; was organized. Later in the same month, the Yugoslav Army arrested four Slovenian journalists of the alternative magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Mladina\"&gt;Mladina&lt;/a&gt;\", accusing them of revealing state secrets. The so-called &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana%20trial\"&gt;Ljubljana trial&lt;/a&gt; triggered mass protests in Ljubljana and other Slovenian cities. (See:&lt;a href=\"1987-1988%20Slovenia%20protests\"&gt;1987-1988 Slovenia protests&lt;/a&gt;)\nA mass democratic movement, coordinated by the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Committee for the Defense of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;, pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms. These revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated by almost one year the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201989\"&gt;Revolutions of 1989&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Europe, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.\nAt the same time, the confrontation between the Slovenian Communists and the Serbian Communist Party (which was dominated by the nationalist leader &lt;a href=\"Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87\"&gt;Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;), became the most important political struggle in Yugoslavia. The poor economic performance of the Federation, and rising clashes between the different republics, created a fertile soil for the rise of secessionist ideas among Slovenes, both anti-Communists and Communists. On 27 of September 1989 the Slovenian Assembly made many amendments to the 1974 constitution including the abandonment of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;League of Communists of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; monopoly on political power and the right of Slovenia to leave Yugoslavia.\nIn an action named \"Action North\" in 1989, Slovene police forces, members of which later organized their own veteran organization, prevented several hundred Milo\u0161evi\u0107 supporters from meeting in Ljubljana on 1 December at a so-called &lt;a href=\"Rally%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Rally of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, with an attempt to overthrow Slovenian leadership because of its opposition to Serb centralist policy. The action can be considered the first defense action for Slovenian independence.\nOn 23 January 1990, the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;League of Communists of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, in protest against the domination of the Serb nationalist leadership, walked out of the 14th Congress of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;League of Communists of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; which effectively ceased to exist as a national party \u2013 they were followed soon after by the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Croatia\"&gt;League of Communists of Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn September 1989, numerous &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20amendment\"&gt;constitutional amendment&lt;/a&gt;s were passed by the &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20the%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20democracy\"&gt;parliamentary democracy&lt;/a&gt; to Slovenia. On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly passed the amendment XCI changing the official name of the state to the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Republic of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; dropping the word 'Socialist'. The new name has been official since 8 March 1990.\nRepublic of Slovenia.\nFree elections.\nOn 30 December 1989 Slovenia officially opened the spring 1990 elections to opposition parties thus inaugurating &lt;a href=\"multi-party%20democracy\"&gt;multi-party democracy&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Democratic Opposition of Slovenia\" (DEMOS) coalition of democratic political parties was created by an agreement between the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;Slovenian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Social Democrat Alliance of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Christian%20Democrats\"&gt;Slovene Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Farmers' Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greens%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Greens of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the coalition was the well-known &lt;a href=\"dissident\"&gt;dissident&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jo%C5%BEe%20Pu%C4%8Dnik\"&gt;Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 8 April 1990, &lt;a href=\"1990%20Slovenian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;the first free multiparty parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;, and the first round of the Presidential elections, were held. &lt;a href=\"DEMOS\"&gt;DEMOS&lt;/a&gt; defeated the former Communist party in the parliamentary elections, by gathering 54% of the votes. A coalition government led by the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Christian%20Democrats\"&gt;Christian Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lojze%20Peterle\"&gt;Lojze Peterle&lt;/a&gt; was formed, and began economic and political reforms that established a &lt;a href=\"market%20economy\"&gt;market economy&lt;/a&gt; and a liberal democratic political system. At the same time, the government pursued the independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia.\n&lt;a href=\"Milan%20Ku%C4%8Dan\"&gt;Milan Ku\u010dan&lt;/a&gt; was elected President in the second round of the Presidential elections on 22 Apr 1990, defeating the &lt;a href=\"DEMOS%20coalition\"&gt;DEMOS&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Jo%C5%BEe%20Pu%C4%8Dnik\"&gt;Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik&lt;/a&gt;.\nKu\u010dan presidency (1990\u20132002).\nThe DEMOS government (1990\u20131992): Independence.\nMilan Ku\u010dan strongly opposed the preservation of Yugoslavia through violent means. After the concept of a loose &lt;a href=\"confederation\"&gt;confederation&lt;/a&gt; failed to gain support by the republics of Yugoslavia, Ku\u010dan favoured a controlled process of non-violent disassociation that would enable the collaboration of the former Yugoslav nations on a new, different basis.\nOn 23 December 1990, a &lt;a href=\"1990%20Slovenian%20independence%20referendum\"&gt;referendum on the independence of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; was held, in which the more than 88% of Slovenian residents voted for the independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Slovenia became independent through the passage of the appropriate acts on 25 June 1991. In the morning of the next day, a short &lt;a href=\"Ten-Day%20War\"&gt;Ten-Day War&lt;/a&gt; began, in which the Slovenian forces successfully rejected Yugoslav military interference. In the evening, the independence was solemnly proclaimed in Ljubljana by the Speaker of the Parliament &lt;a href=\"France%20Bu%C4%8Dar\"&gt;France Bu\u010dar&lt;/a&gt;. The Ten-Day War lasted till 7 July 1991, when the &lt;a href=\"Brijuni%20Agreement\"&gt;Brijuni Agreement&lt;/a&gt; was made, with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt; as a mediator, and the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20National%20Army\"&gt;Yugoslav National Army&lt;/a&gt; started its withdrawal from Slovenia. On 26 October 1991, the last Yugoslav soldier left Slovenia.\nOn 23 December 1991 the Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia passed a new Constitution, which became the first &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Constitution of independent Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;.\nKu\u010dan represented Slovenia at the peace conference on former Yugoslavia in &lt;a href=\"the%20Hague\"&gt;the Hague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; which concluded that the former Yugoslav nations were free to determine their future as independent states. On May 22, 1992 Ku\u010dan represented Slovenia as it became a new member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most important achievement of the Coalition, however, was the declaration of independence of Slovenia on 25 June 1991, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Ten-Day%20War\"&gt;Ten-Day War&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;ns rejected &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt; military interference.\nAs a result of internal disagreements the coalition fell apart in 1992. It was officially dissolved in April 1992 in agreement with all the parties that had composed it. Following the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Lojze%20Peterle\"&gt;Lojze Peterle&lt;/a&gt;'s government, a new coalition government, led by &lt;a href=\"Janez%20Drnov%C5%A1ek\"&gt;Janez Drnov\u0161ek&lt;/a&gt; was formed, which included several parties of the former DEMOS. &lt;a href=\"Jo%C5%BEe%20Pu%C4%8Dnik\"&gt;Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik&lt;/a&gt; became vice-president in Drnov\u0161ek's cabinet, guaranteeing some continuity in the government policies.\nThe first country to recognise Slovenia as an independent country was Croatia on 26 June 1991. In the second half of 1991, some of the countries formed after the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; recognized Slovenia. These were the Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and Georgia, Ukraine, and Belarus. On 19 December 1991, Iceland and Sweden recognised Slovenia, and Germany passed a resolution on the recognition of Slovenia, realised alongside the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Community\"&gt;European Economic Community&lt;/a&gt; (EEC) on 15 January 1992. On 13, respectively 14 January 1992, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt; and San Marino recognised Slovenia. The first transmarine countries to recognise Slovenia were Canada and Australia on the 15, respectively 16 January 1992. The United States was at first very reserved towards the Slovenian independence and recognised Slovenia only on 7 April 1992.\nThe recognition by the EEC was particularly significant for Slovenia, as in December 1991 the EEC passed criteria for the international recognition of newly founded countries, which included &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the respect for &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;, the government of &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, and the respect for the &lt;a href=\"minority%20rights\"&gt;national minority rights&lt;/a&gt;. The recognition of Slovenia therefore indirectly also meant that Slovenia had been meeting the passed criteria.\nIn December 1992, after the independence and the international recognition of Slovenia, Ku\u010dan was elected as the first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;President of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Slovenian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1992 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, with the support of the citizens list. He won another five-year term in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Slovenian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1997 election&lt;/a&gt;, running again as an independent and again winning the majority in the first round.\nDrnov\u0161ek premiership (1992\u20132002): Re-orientation of Slovenia's trade.\nDrnov\u0161ek was the second &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of independent Slovenia. He was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy, transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties. Drnov\u0161ek's governments reoriented Slovenia's trade away from Yugoslavia towards the West and contrary to some other former Communist countries in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the economic and social transformation followed a &lt;a href=\"gradualist\"&gt;gradualist&lt;/a&gt; approach. After six months in opposition from May 2000 to Autumn 2000, Drnov\u0161ek returned to power again and helped to arrange the first meeting between &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bush-Putin%202001\"&gt;Bush-Putin 2001&lt;/a&gt;).\nDrnov\u0161ek presidency (2002\u20132007); EU and NATO membership.\nDrnov\u0161ek held the position of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;President of Republic&lt;/a&gt; from 2002 to 2007. During the term, in March 2003, Slovenia held &lt;a href=\"2003%20Slovenian%20European%20Union%20and%20NATO%20membership%20referendum\"&gt;two referendums on joining the EU and NATO&lt;/a&gt;. Slovenia joined NATO on 29 March 2004 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2007 Slovenia joined the &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; and adopted the &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; as its currency.\nJan\u0161a premiership (2004\u20132008): Unsustainable growth.\n&lt;a href=\"Janez%20Jan%C5%A1a\"&gt;Janez Jan\u0161a&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; from November 2004 to November 2008 for the first time. During the term characterized by over-enthusiasm after joining EU, between 2005 and 2008 the Slovenian banks have seen &lt;a href=\"loan-deposit%20ratio\"&gt;loan-deposit ratio&lt;/a&gt; veering out of control, over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting private sector, leading to its unsustainable growth.\nT\u00fcrk presidency (2007\u20132012).\n&lt;a href=\"Danilo%20T%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Danilo T\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt; held the position of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;President of Republic&lt;/a&gt; from 2007 to 2012.\nPahor premiership (2008\u20132012): Blocked reforms.\n&lt;a href=\"Borut%20Pahor\"&gt;Borut Pahor&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; from November 2008 until February 2012. Faced by the &lt;a href=\"Late-2000s%20recession\"&gt;global economic crisis&lt;/a&gt; his government proposed economic reforms, but they were rejected by the opposition leader Janez Jan\u0161a and blocked by &lt;a href=\"Slovenian%20referendums%20of%202011\"&gt;referenda in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the voters &lt;a href=\"2010%20Slovenian%20border%20dispute%20agreement%20referendum\"&gt;voted in favour&lt;/a&gt; of an arbitration agreement with Croatia, aimed to solve the &lt;a href=\"Croatia%E2%80%93Slovenia%20border%20disputes\"&gt;border dispute&lt;/a&gt; between the countries, emerging after the breakup of Yugoslavia.\nPahor Presidency (2012-).\nPahor has held the position of &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; since 2012. In November 2017, Slovenian President Borut Pahor was re-elected for a second term in close &lt;a href=\"2017%20Slovenian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;.\nJan\u0161a premiership (2012\u20132013): Anti-corruption report.\nJan\u0161a was &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; from February 2012 until March 2013 for the second time. He was replaced by the first female PM in history of Slovenia, &lt;a href=\"Alenka%20Bratu%C5%A1ek\"&gt;Alenka Bratu\u0161ek&lt;/a&gt;, after the official &lt;a href=\"Commission%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Corruption%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Slovenia\"&gt;anti-corruption agency&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Report on the Parliamentary Parties' Leaders\" was issued.\nFormer prime minister Janez Jan\u0161a spent six months in prison in 2014 after being convicted on bribery charges related to a 2006 arms deal. Jan\u0161a had denied any wrongdoing.\n&lt;a href=\"Miro%20Cerar\"&gt;Miro Cerar&lt;/a&gt; was prime minister since September 2014 until March 2018. His government coalition included Cerar\u2019s Party of Modern Centre, the Social Democrats and pensioners\u2019 party DeSUS. \nIn June 2018, the center-right Slovenia Democratic Party (SDS) of former prime minister Janez Jan\u0161a won in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Slovenian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;. SDS secured 25 seats in the 90-seat parliament. A center-left party, The List of &lt;a href=\"Marjan%20%C5%A0arec\"&gt;Marjan \u0160arec&lt;/a&gt; (LM\u0160), was in second place with 13 seats. Cerar\u2019s Party of The Modern Centre was fourth with just 10 seats. \nIn August 2018, new prime minister Marjan \u0160arec formed a minority government made up of five center-left parties. \nIn January 2020, prime minister \u0160arec resigned because his minority government was too weak to push through important legislation.\nJan\u0161a premiership (2020-).\nIn March 2020, Janez Jan\u0161a became prime minister for third time in the new coalition government of SDS, the Modern Centre Party (SMC), New Slovenia (NSi) and Pensioners' Party (DeSUS). Jan\u0161a had previously been prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2013. "
