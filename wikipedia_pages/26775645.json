He was disqualified from the 2010 event after failing a test for the banned substance &lt;a href=\"MIRCERA\"&gt;MIRCERA&lt;/a&gt; and he was suspended from competition for two years.\nCareer.\nA late comer to professional &lt;a href=\"athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, Boujattaoui began to compete internationally in 2008. His first major competition was the &lt;a href=\"2008%20IAAF%20World%20Cross%20Country%20Championships\"&gt;2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships&lt;/a&gt;, where he finished in 40th place. The following year he had much improved and finished in eighth place at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20IAAF%20World%20Cross%20Country%20Championships\"&gt;2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships&lt;/a&gt;, leading the Moroccan men's team to sixth place in the rankings.

However, his performance did not stand as he failed a pre-competition drugs test for &lt;a href=\"Methoxy%20polyethylene%20glycol-epoetin%20beta\"&gt;MIRCERA&lt;/a&gt; (an variant on the banned blood booster &lt;a href=\"Erythropoietin\"&gt;EPO&lt;/a&gt;). He was banned from competition for two years, with the suspension lasting until May 2012. His disqualification also meant Morocco were moved to fifth in the team rankings at the World Cross Country Championships."
