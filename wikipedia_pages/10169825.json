    "text": " Derek John \"Blue\" Weaver (born 11 March 1947) is a Welsh rock keyboardist, &lt;a href=\"session%20musician\"&gt;session musician&lt;/a&gt;, songwriter and &lt;a href=\"record%20producer\"&gt;record producer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nWeaver's career as a musician began as a co-founding member of 1960s Welsh rock band &lt;a href=\"Amen%20Corner%20%28band%29\"&gt;Amen Corner&lt;/a&gt; and its successor &lt;a href=\"Fair%20Weather\"&gt;Fair Weather&lt;/a&gt;. In 1971, Weaver joined &lt;a href=\"Strawbs\"&gt;Strawbs&lt;/a&gt; after keyboardist &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Wakeman\"&gt;Rick Wakeman&lt;/a&gt; departed to join &lt;a href=\"Yes%20%28band%29\"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;, contributing notable keyboard and &lt;a href=\"Mellotron\"&gt;Mellotron&lt;/a&gt; parts on\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grave%20New%20World\"&gt;Grave New World&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bursting%20at%20the%20Seams\"&gt;Bursting at the Seams&lt;/a&gt;\", the bands' most successful and critically-acclaimed albums. Weaver left Strawbs in 1973 and toured with &lt;a href=\"Mott%20the%20Hoople\"&gt;Mott the Hoople&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"concert%20tour\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; with supporting act &lt;a href=\"Queen%20%28band%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, he toured with &lt;a href=\"Streetwalkers\"&gt;Streetwalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1975, former Amen Corner bandmate &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Bryon\"&gt;Dennis Bryon&lt;/a&gt;, who had begun playing drums in The Bee Gees backing band the year before, suggested Weaver as a replacement keyboardist for the band following the departure of Geoff Westley. The three-piece backing band of Weaver, Bryon and the perennial Bee Gees sideman, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Kendall\"&gt;Alan Kendall&lt;/a&gt;, played on the Bee Gees' albums \"&lt;a href=\"Main%20Course\"&gt;Main Course&lt;/a&gt;\" (1975), \"&lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Children of the World&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976), \"&lt;a href=\"Here%20at%20Last...%20Bee%20Gees...%20Live\"&gt;Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), and \"&lt;a href=\"Spirits%20Having%20Flown\"&gt;Spirits Having Flown&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979), as well as the band's famous contributions on the \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Fever%20%28soundtrack%29\"&gt;Saturday Night Fever&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Soundtrack%20album\"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, including songs like \"&lt;a href=\"Jive%20Talkin%27\"&gt;Jive Talkin'&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"You%20Should%20Be%20Dancing\"&gt;You Should Be Dancing&lt;/a&gt;\". Though not credited, Weaver greatly influenced the hit song \"&lt;a href=\"How%20Deep%20Is%20Your%20Love%20%28Bee%20Gees%20song%29\"&gt;How Deep Is Your Love&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAs a songwriter and composer, Weaver was credited as a co-composer on &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Gibb\"&gt;Andy Gibb&lt;/a&gt;'s hit song, \"&lt;a href=\"%28Our%20Love%29%20Don%27t%20Throw%20It%20All%20Away\"&gt;(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as songs for &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Ruffin\"&gt;Jimmy Ruffin&lt;/a&gt;'s 1980 album \"Sunrise\" with Robin Gibb as lyricist, including the hit single, \"Hold On (To My Love)\". Weaver composed the soundtrack for the film \"&lt;a href=\"Times%20Square%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Times Square&lt;/a&gt;\", again collaborating with Robin Gibb on Gibb's duet with &lt;a href=\"Marcella%20Detroit\"&gt;Marcy Levy&lt;/a&gt;, \"Help Me\". In 1980, Weaver worked as a session player for the &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Shop%20Boys\"&gt;Pet Shop Boys&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs of 2009, Weaver was a director and supporter of &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Producers%20Guild\"&gt;The Music Producers Guild&lt;/a&gt;."
