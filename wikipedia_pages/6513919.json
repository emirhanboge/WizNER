The land holders involved included &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Pedroso%20Malachi\"&gt;Antonio Pedroso Malachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Jose%20Rodrigues\"&gt;Antonio Jose Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt;, Manoel Jacinto Bridge and Father Chico of Africa. Malachi, whose estate was called \"Vila Nossa &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Aparacida\"&gt;Senhora Aparecida&lt;/a&gt;\", donated about of land which was divided amongst &lt;a href=\"tenant%20farmer\"&gt;tenant farmer&lt;/a&gt;s. He built a chapel dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Blessed Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt; (located at 21 de Abril Plaza).\nOn 10 March 1885, under law 31, the village was made a \"district of peace\".

On 26 October 1906, under law 1018, the district was founded and ratified on 12 December 1906. The name of the municipality has changed over time, including, Capela de Sert\u00e3ozinho, Engenho de Nossa Senhora Aparecida do Sertaozinho, Aparecida de Sert\u00e3ozinho, and its current name, Sert\u00e3ozinho. The first municipal magistrate was &lt;a href=\"Renato%20Silveira%20da%20Motta\"&gt;Renato Silveira da Motta&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor many years, the main industry of the municipality was &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; production.

In the 1960s, Sertaozinho was again a center of conflicted labour relations in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; when sugar cane cutters and mill workers threatened to &lt;a href=\"strike%20action\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; over pay.\nGeography.\nSert\u00e3ozinho is located about 20\u00a0km to the west of the town of &lt;a href=\"Ribeir%C3%A3o%20Preto\"&gt;Ribeir\u00e3o Preto&lt;/a&gt; in the northern part of the state of &lt;a href=\"Sao%20Paulo\"&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.
