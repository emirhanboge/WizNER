    "text": "The L.H. Ford Bridge is a concrete balanced cantilever bridge that carries the &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Highway\"&gt;Mitchell Highway&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Macquarie%20River\"&gt;Macquarie River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dubbo\"&gt;Dubbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. It was officially open to traffic by the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Local%20Government%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Minister for Local Government&lt;/a&gt; and Minister for Highways, &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Morton\"&gt;Pat Morton&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 1969 and named in honour of the former Mayor of Dubbo and Member of the New South Wales Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Dubbo\"&gt;Dubbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Les%20Ford\"&gt;Les Ford&lt;/a&gt;. Work commended in 2018 to strengthen and extend the life of the bridge, with the project completed in 2020.\nHistory and condition.\nL.H. Ford Bridge was built in the 1960s to replace an old wooden bridge over the Macquarie River - Wambuul, at the time of its completion, the bridge was the fourth longest highway bridge in NSW at in length. Since its opening, the centre span of the bridge had significantly sagged, reducing the lifespan, causing a noticeable dip and increased maintenance costs. In November 2018 work commenced on strengthening the centre span of the bridge with the construction of two piers in the river to support the centre span and each end of the cantilever fitted with external post tensioning cables, extending the life of the bridge and to allow for heavy vehicles up to 68 tonnes, which was completed in 2020."
