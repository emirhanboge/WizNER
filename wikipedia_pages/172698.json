    "text": "Kongsvinger () is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Norway\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; and is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Norway\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Innlandet\"&gt;Innlandet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Norway\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Norway\"&gt;traditional region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%A5mdal\"&gt;Gl\u00e5mdal&lt;/a&gt;. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Kongsvinger.\nA patch of land on both sides of the river &lt;a href=\"Glomma\"&gt;Glomma&lt;/a&gt; with an area of approximately was separated from &lt;a href=\"Vinger\"&gt;Vinger&lt;/a&gt; as a town named Kongsvinger by &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Charter\"&gt;Royal Charter&lt;/a&gt; in 1854. The municipalities of Vinger and &lt;a href=\"Brandval\"&gt;Brandval&lt;/a&gt; were merged with Kongsvinger on 1 January 1964. The new municipality of Kongsvinger briefly lost its status as a town after this &lt;a href=\"amalgamation%20%28politics%29\"&gt;amalgamation&lt;/a&gt;, but was later reinstated with its town status. The town is about from the &lt;a href=\"Norway-Sweden%20border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern part of the municipality is marking the border with the &lt;a href=\"Eda%20Municipality\"&gt;Eda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torsby%20Municipality\"&gt;Torsby&lt;/a&gt; municipalities across the boundary.\nGeneral information.\nName.\nThe first element \"Kongs-\" (\"the King's\") was added after the fortress was built in 1690. It was first applied only to the fortress (written as \"K\u00f6nigs Winger\" in old documents), then to the city that grew up around it and finally the modern municipality. The second element \"&lt;a href=\"Vinger\"&gt;Vinger&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt;: \"Vingr\") is an old district name which is still in use.\nCoat-of-arms.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat-of-arms&lt;/a&gt; is from relatively modern times. They were granted on 25 June 1926. The arms show the &lt;a href=\"Kongsvinger%20Fortress\"&gt;Kongsvinger Fortress&lt;/a&gt; with the white line representing the &lt;a href=\"Glomma\"&gt;Glomma&lt;/a&gt; river. The fortress is of historical importance to the area.\nHistory.\nKongsvinger already existed as a &lt;a href=\"Market%20town\"&gt;trading center&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, due to the accessibility by natural waterways. &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; chieftains reached &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; by boat from Kongsvinger. Kongsvinger fortress was founded in 1669, and a star-shaped plan was laid out for the fortress. Work began in 1682 and it was finished in 1690 as part of a general upgrade to &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Norwegian%20fortresses\"&gt;Norwegian fortresses&lt;/a&gt;. The building of the fortress formed the foundations for what was to become the town of Kongsvinger. The fortress was built as a defensive structure against the Swedes, and on numerous occasions there have been military engagements in the area around the fortress, but Kongsvinger fortress has never been taken in military combat. Below Kongsvinger fortress lies \u00d8vrebyen, which literally translated means Uppertown. This is the oldest part of the town of Kongsvinger, and one can still find a number of the original houses built after the establishment of the fortress. Kongsvinger Museum is located here, together with a museum of female emancipation in a building called \"Rolighed\", the home of Dagny Juel, the famous author once portrayed by Edvard Munch. \u00d8vrebyen was designated as an area of special antiquarian interest in 1973. Today, \u00d8vrebyen, the old uptown area around the fortress is dominated by wooden buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries, laid out in the typical right angle square plan - by architect Cicignon - popular in this period.\nThe eastern parts of Kongsvinger and its neighboring municipalities to the north and south were populated at the end of the 17th century by &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; emigrants who came across the &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; border. The area is called &lt;a href=\"Finnskogen\"&gt;Finnskogen&lt;/a&gt;, \"\"The Finnish forest\".\"\nKongsvinger played an important part in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20resistance%20movement\"&gt;Norwegian resistance&lt;/a&gt; force against the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; being a gateway to Sweden. Norway's highest decorated citizen, &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%20S%C3%B8nsteby\"&gt;Gunnar S\u00f8nsteby&lt;/a&gt; frequently passed through Kongsvinger in his work to sabotage the Nazis' installations in Norway. Some of the busiest escape routes for refugees also went through Kongsvinger to Sweden.\nIn 1964, Kongsvinger and the surrounding municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Vinger\"&gt;Vinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brandval\"&gt;Brandval&lt;/a&gt; were united into the present Kongsvinger Municipality. Kongsvinger has &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; status (from 1854), and is thereby both &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and township, governed by a &lt;a href=\"town%20council\"&gt;town council&lt;/a&gt; under a &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;, elected by popular vote. There are also appointed &lt;a href=\"executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"officials\"&gt;officials&lt;/a&gt;, such as town commissioner or town director \"(r\u00e5dmann)\", who is &lt;a href=\"chief%20executive\"&gt;chief executive&lt;/a&gt; of the municipality, and its 700 plus workforce. There are 1,530 businesses including &lt;a href=\"forestry\"&gt;forestry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, and 245 of these are retail outlets. There are of mall situated in the downtown area. As well as downtown shopping streets, there are also glass domed pedestrian shopping streets. The governmental regional hospital is also situated in Kongsvinger.\nFrom 1983 to 1999, and again in 2010, Kongsvinger's &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"KIL%20Toppfotball\"&gt;KIL Toppfotball&lt;/a&gt; held a position in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Norwegian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. It made some notable merits participating in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and winning a &lt;a href=\"silver%20medal\"&gt;silver medal&lt;/a&gt; during the 1992 season.\nGeography.\nKongsvinger is situated on both sides of the river &lt;a href=\"Glomma\"&gt;Glomma&lt;/a&gt;, where the south-flowing river takes a sharp northwestward turn. The &lt;a href=\"Kongsvinger%20Fortress\"&gt;Kongsvinger Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is the main landmark, situated on a hill west and north of the river. Kongsvinger is a regional center of the Gl\u00e5mdal region, which is made up of the southern parts of &lt;a href=\"Hedmark\"&gt;Hedmark&lt;/a&gt; county. It is bordered to the west by the municipality of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B8r-Odal\"&gt;S\u00f8r-Odal&lt;/a&gt;, to the north by &lt;a href=\"Grue%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Grue&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south by &lt;a href=\"Eidskog\"&gt;Eidskog&lt;/a&gt;. To the east it borders to &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. Kongsvinger is about from &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Gardermoen\"&gt;Oslo Airport, Gardermoen&lt;/a&gt;.\nTown.\nThe downtown area of Kongsvinger is currently being refurbished with a new public library being built, and the town square being given a face lift. There are also plans for a new hotel to be built in conjunction to the refurbishment of the down town area as well as for the construction of two new shopping centres. These plans are part of the overall strategy of the city council to make Kongsvinger more attractive to &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourists&lt;/a&gt; and potential new residents.\nSubdivisions\nDistances.\nThe following are road distances to Kongsvinger from various locations:\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2014 sister cities.\nThe following cities are &lt;a href=\"town%20twinning\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with Kongsvinger:\nIn popular culture.\nKongsvinger is referenced within the title (and indirectly within the lyrics) of the song \"A Sentence Of Sorts In Kongsvinger\" by the American rock band &lt;a href=\"Of%20Montreal\"&gt;Of Montreal&lt;/a&gt; on the 2007 album \"&lt;a href=\"Hissing%20Fauna%2C%20Are%20You%20the%20Destroyer%3F\"&gt;Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?&lt;/a&gt;\"."
