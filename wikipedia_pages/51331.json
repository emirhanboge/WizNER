    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20analysis\"&gt;dimensional analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a dimensionless quantity is a &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantity&lt;/a&gt; to which no physical dimension is assigned, also known as a bare, pure, or scalar quantity or a quantity of dimension one, with a corresponding unit of measurement in the &lt;a href=\"International%20System%20of%20Units\"&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt; of the unit one (or 1), which is not explicitly shown. Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;. Dimensionless quantities are distinct from quantities that have associated dimensions, such as &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; (measured in &lt;a href=\"second\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;s). However, the symbols rad and sr are written explicitly where appropriate, in order to emphasize that, for radians or steradians, the quantity being considered is, or involves the plane angle or solid angle respectively. For example, &lt;a href=\"etendue\"&gt;etendue&lt;/a&gt; is defined as having units of meters times steradians.\nHistory.\nQuantities having dimension one, \"dimensionless quantities\", regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20analysis\"&gt;dimensional analysis&lt;/a&gt;. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Fourier\"&gt;Joseph Fourier&lt;/a&gt; and Scottish physicist &lt;a href=\"James%20Clerk%20Maxwell\"&gt;James Clerk Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; led significant developments in the modern concepts of &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unit%20%28measurement%29\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;. Later work by British physicists &lt;a href=\"Osborne%20Reynolds\"&gt;Osborne Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rayleigh\"&gt;Lord Rayleigh&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics. Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Buckingham\"&gt;Edgar Buckingham&lt;/a&gt; proved the &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20%CF%80%20theorem\"&gt;theorem&lt;/a&gt; (independently of French mathematician &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Bertrand\"&gt;Joseph Bertrand&lt;/a&gt;'s previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities.\nNumerous dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s, particularly in the areas of &lt;a href=\"fluid%20mechanics\"&gt;fluid mechanics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heat%20transfer\"&gt;heat transfer&lt;/a&gt;. Measuring \"ratios\" in the (derived) unit \"dB\" (&lt;a href=\"decibel\"&gt;decibel&lt;/a&gt;) finds widespread use nowadays.\nIn the early 2000s, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures\"&gt;International Committee for Weights and Measures&lt;/a&gt; discussed naming the unit of 1 as the \"&lt;a href=\"Uno%20%28unit%29\"&gt;uno&lt;/a&gt;\", but the idea of just introducing a new SI name for 1 was dropped.\nIntegers.\n&lt;a href=\"Integer%20numbers\"&gt;Integer numbers&lt;/a&gt; may be used to represent discrete dimensionless quantities. \nMore specifically, &lt;a href=\"counting%20numbers\"&gt;counting numbers&lt;/a&gt; can be used to express countable quantities, such as the &lt;a href=\"number%20of%20particles\"&gt;number of particles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"population%20size\"&gt;population size&lt;/a&gt;. In mathematics, the \"number of elements\" in a set is termed \"&lt;a href=\"cardinality\"&gt;cardinality&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Countable%20noun\"&gt;Countable noun&lt;/a&gt;s\" is a related linguistics concept.\nRatios, proportions, and angles.\nDimensionless quantities are often obtained as &lt;a href=\"ratio\"&gt;ratio&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantities&lt;/a&gt; that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation. Examples include calculating &lt;a href=\"slope\"&gt;slope&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Conversion%20of%20units\"&gt;unit conversion factors&lt;/a&gt;. A more complex example of such a ratio is &lt;a href=\"engineering%20strain\"&gt;engineering strain&lt;/a&gt;, a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension \"length\", their ratio is dimensionless. Another set of examples is &lt;a href=\"mass%20fraction%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;mass fraction&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mole%20fraction\"&gt;mole fraction&lt;/a&gt;s often written using &lt;a href=\"parts-per%20notation\"&gt;parts-per notation&lt;/a&gt; such as ppm (=\u00a010\u22126), ppb (=\u00a010\u22129), and ppt (=\u00a010\u221212), or perhaps confusingly as ratios of two identical units (&lt;a href=\"kilogram\"&gt;kg&lt;/a&gt;/kg or &lt;a href=\"mole%20%28unit%29\"&gt;mol&lt;/a&gt;/mol). For example, &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20by%20volume\"&gt;alcohol by volume&lt;/a&gt;, which characterizes the concentration of &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"alcoholic%20beverage\"&gt;alcoholic beverage&lt;/a&gt;, could be written as .\nOther common proportions are percentages &lt;a href=\"%25\"&gt;%&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(=\u00a00.01), \u00a0&lt;a href=\"per%20mil\"&gt;\u2030&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(=\u00a00.001) and angle units such as &lt;a href=\"radian\"&gt;radian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"degree%20%28angle%29\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; (\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a0) and &lt;a href=\"gradian\"&gt;grad&lt;/a&gt; (=\u00a0). In &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"coefficient%20of%20variation\"&gt;coefficient of variation&lt;/a&gt; is the ratio of the &lt;a href=\"standard%20deviation\"&gt;standard deviation&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"average\"&gt;mean&lt;/a&gt; and is used to measure the &lt;a href=\"Statistical%20dispersion\"&gt;dispersion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"statistical%20data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has been argued that quantities defined as ratios having equal dimensions in numerator and denominator are actually only \"unitless quantities\" and still have physical dimension defined as .\nFor example, &lt;a href=\"moisture%20content\"&gt;moisture content&lt;/a&gt; may be defined as a ratio of volumes (volumetric moisture, m3\u22c5m\u22123, dimension L\u22c5L) or as a ratio of masses (gravimetric moisture, units kg\u22c5kg\u22121, dimension M\u22c5M); both would be unitless quantities, but of different dimension.\nBuckingham theorem.\nThe Buckingham theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an &lt;a href=\"Identity%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by &lt;a href=\"Boyle%27s%20Law\"&gt;Boyle's Law&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.\nAnother consequence of the theorem is that the &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;functional&lt;/a&gt; dependence between a certain number (say, \"n\") of &lt;a href=\"variable%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;variables&lt;/a&gt; can be reduced by the number (say, \"k\") of &lt;a href=\"independent%20variable\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s occurring in those variables to give a set of \"p\" = \"n\" \u2212 \"k\" independent, dimensionless &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantities&lt;/a&gt;. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantity&lt;/a&gt; are equivalent.\nExample.\nTo demonstrate the application of the theorem, consider the &lt;a href=\"electric%20power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; consumption of a &lt;a href=\"stirrer\"&gt;stirrer&lt;/a&gt; with a given shape.\nThe power, \"P\", in dimensions [M \u00b7 L2/T3], is a function of the &lt;a href=\"density\"&gt;density&lt;/a&gt;, \"\u03c1\" [M/L3], and the &lt;a href=\"viscosity\"&gt;viscosity&lt;/a&gt; of the fluid to be stirred, \"\u03bc\" [M/(L \u00b7 T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its &lt;a href=\"diameter\"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt;, \"D\" [L], and the &lt;a href=\"Angular%20velocity\"&gt;angular speed&lt;/a&gt; of the stirrer, \"n\" [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of \"n\" = 5 variables representing our example. Those \"n\" = 5 variables are built up from \"k\" = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L (&lt;a href=\"SI\"&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt; units: &lt;a href=\"meters\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt;), time: T (&lt;a href=\"second\"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;), and mass: M (&lt;a href=\"kilograms\"&gt;kg&lt;/a&gt;).\nAccording to the -theorem, the \"n\" = 5 variables can be reduced by the \"k\" = 3 dimensions to form \"p\" = \"n\" \u2212 \"k\" = 5 \u2212 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. Usually, these quantities are chosen as formula_1, commonly named the &lt;a href=\"Reynolds%20number\"&gt;Reynolds number&lt;/a&gt; which describes the fluid flow regime, and formula_2, the &lt;a href=\"power%20number\"&gt;power number&lt;/a&gt;, which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.\nNote that the two dimensionless quantities are not unique and depend on which of the \"n\" = 5 variables are chosen as the \"k\" = 3 independent basis variables, which appear in both dimensionless quantities. The Reynolds number and power number fall from the above analysis if formula_3, \"n\", and \"D\" are chosen to be the basis variables. If instead, formula_4, \"n\", and \"D\" are selected, the Reynolds number is recovered while the second dimensionless quantity becomes formula_5. We note that formula_6 is the product of the Reynolds number and the power number.\nDimensionless physical constants.\nCertain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the &lt;a href=\"speed%20of%20light\"&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt; in a vacuum, the &lt;a href=\"universal%20gravitational%20constant\"&gt;universal gravitational constant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Planck%27s%20constant\"&gt;Planck's constant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coulomb%27s%20constant\"&gt;Coulomb's constant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boltzmann%27s%20constant\"&gt;Boltzmann's constant&lt;/a&gt; can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"length\"&gt;length&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"electric%20charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; are chosen. The resulting &lt;a href=\"system%20of%20units\"&gt;system of units&lt;/a&gt; is known as the &lt;a href=\"natural%20units\"&gt;natural units&lt;/a&gt;, specifically regarding these five constants, &lt;a href=\"Planck%20units\"&gt;Planck units&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all &lt;a href=\"physical%20constant\"&gt;physical constant&lt;/a&gt;s can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally:\nOther quantities produced by nondimensionalization.\nPhysics often uses dimensionless &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantities&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena. These may be found by applying the &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20%CF%80%20theorem\"&gt;Buckingham theorem&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise may emerge from making &lt;a href=\"partial%20differential%20equations\"&gt;partial differential equations&lt;/a&gt; unitless by the process of &lt;a href=\"nondimensionalization\"&gt;nondimensionalization&lt;/a&gt;. Engineering, economics, and other fields often extend these ideas in &lt;a href=\"design\"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; and analysis of the relevant systems."
