    "text": "The \"human\" cannonball act is a performance in which a person who acts as the \"cannonball\" is ejected from a specially designed \"cannon\". The human cannonball lands on a horizontal net or inflated bag placed at the landing point, as predicted by &lt;a href=\"classical%20mechanics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;. Outdoor performances may aim at a body of water.\nHistory.\nThe first \"human\" cannonball, launched in 1877 at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aquarium\"&gt;Royal Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, was a 14-year-old girl called \"Zazel\", whose real name was &lt;a href=\"Rossa%20Matilda%20Richter\"&gt;Rossa Matilda Richter&lt;/a&gt;. She was launched by a spring-style cannon invented by Canadian &lt;a href=\"William%20Leonard%20Hunt\"&gt;William Leonard Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (\"The Great Farini\"). She later toured with the &lt;a href=\"Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus\"&gt;P.T. Barnum Circus&lt;/a&gt;. Farini's cannon used rubber springs to launch a person from the cannon, limiting the distance they could be launched. Richter's career as a human cannonball ended when a launch went awry and she broke her back.\nIn the 1920s, &lt;a href=\"Ildebrando%20Zacchini\"&gt;Ildebrando Zacchini&lt;/a&gt; invented a cannon that used compressed air to launch a human cannonball. Zacchini shot his son &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Zacchini\"&gt;Hugo Zacchini&lt;/a&gt; out of the compressed air cannon. Members of the Zacchini family were later inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Ringling%20Brothers\"&gt;Ringling Brothers&lt;/a&gt; Circus Hall of Fame.\nWorld record.\nThere is a claim that the current world record for the longest human cannonball flight is , established by David \"The Bullet\" Smith Jr. on the set of \"Lo Show dei Record\", in Milan, Italy, on March 10, 2011. The distance was measured from the mouth of the cannon to the farthest point reached on the net. Smith was launched by an 8\u00a0m (26'\u00a03\") long cannon. It was estimated that he traveled at a speed of 120\u00a0km/h (74.6\u00a0mph), reaching a maximum altitude of 23\u00a0m (75'\u00a06\").\nThere is, however, a contradictory claim that Smith's father, David \"Cannonball\" Smith Sr., set a record of , on August 31, 2002, at &lt;a href=\"The%20Steele%20County%20Free%20Fair\"&gt;The Steele County Free Fair&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Owatonna%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Owatonna, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that Smith Sr. traveled at over during the flight.\nRecently.\nHuman cannonball acts have declined in number in recent years. However, circus performer &lt;a href=\"Bello%20Nock\"&gt;Bello Nock&lt;/a&gt; performed a human cannonball stunt involving him flying over the main rotor of a helicopter during the ninth episode of the &lt;a href=\"America%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28season%2012%29\"&gt;twelfth season of \"America\u2019s Got Talent\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nCannon.\nThe impetus in the cannon is provided either by a &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28device%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; or jet of &lt;a href=\"pneumatics\"&gt;compressed air&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the device work more like a &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;, where the cylinder propelling the human stops at the mouth of the cannon. Some cannons utilize &lt;a href=\"nitrocellulose\"&gt;nitrocellulose&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href=\"dinitrate\"&gt;dinitrate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ester\"&gt;ester&lt;/a&gt;, cellulose dinitrate (pyroxylin).\nIn a &lt;a href=\"circus\"&gt;circus&lt;/a&gt; performance, gunpowder may be used to provide visual and auditory effects unrelated to the launching mechanism. Fireworks and smoke may also be used to increase the visual effect.\nThe largest retailer of these human cannons is located in &lt;a href=\"Greensburg%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Greensburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. This supplier provides approximately 80% of all human cannon catapults.\nRisk.\nMore than 30 human cannonballs have died during the performance of this stunt. Among the latest was that which occurred in Kent, United Kingdom on April 25, 2011, where a human cannonball died as a result of the failure of the safety net. Landing is considered to be the most dangerous aspect of the act.\nSpecial forces.\nThe human cannonball principle is the subject of a patent application by the US &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects%20Agency\"&gt;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&lt;/a&gt;, whereby a rail-guided chair driven by compressed air is brought to a sudden stop, propelling the special forces member, police officer or firefighter onto the roof of a tall building."
