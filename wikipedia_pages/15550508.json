    "text": "Vjekoslav Karas (19 May 1821 - 5 July 1858) was a &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; painter, considered a pioneer of a new era of Croatian painting and art in general.\nLife.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Karlovac\"&gt;Karlovac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, Karas was sent to be educated in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 1938. While in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, he drew inspiration from &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; and religious themes, painting \"Mother with Moses on the river bank\". While in Italy he developed a love for music and learned to play the &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt; while composing songs in both Italian and Croatian. He began focusing his craft on portraits, painting \"Roman woman playing a lute\" and \"Roman commoner\" before returning to Karlovac in 1848. Upon his return, he continued painting portraits and began painting local country life and local folk. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; and began teaching. From 1851-18522 he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Bosnia\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; where he painted a portrait of &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; field marshal and governor &lt;a href=\"Omer-pa%C5%A1a%20Latas\"&gt;Omer-pa\u0161a Latas&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter.\nKaras suffered periodically from depression and had even attempted suicide. He briefly stayed with &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Juraj%20Strossmayer\"&gt;Josip Juraj Strossmayer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%C4%90akovo\"&gt;\u0110akovo&lt;/a&gt;, but left soon after his suicide attempt. Still suffering from depression and living in poverty, Karas committed suicide by drowning in the &lt;a href=\"Korana\"&gt;Korana&lt;/a&gt; river in his native &lt;a href=\"Karlovac\"&gt;Karlovac&lt;/a&gt;."
