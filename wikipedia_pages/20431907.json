    "text": "Hip\u00f2lit L\u00e1zaro (September 13, 1887 \u2013 May 14, 1974), better known as Hip\u00f3lito L\u00e1zaro, was a &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20people\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt;-Spanish opera singer. He was active as an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; for four decades from 1910 through 1950.\nBiography.\nL\u00e1zaro was born in &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, Spain on September 13, 1887.\nHe made his professional debut in 1910 at Teatre Novedades in &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20favorite\"&gt;La favorite&lt;/a&gt;\". His Italian debut occurred in late 1910 in \"&lt;a href=\"Rigoletto\"&gt;Rigoletto&lt;/a&gt;\" at the Teatro Tosi-Borghi in &lt;a href=\"Ferrara\"&gt;Ferrara&lt;/a&gt;. During the summer of 1911, he appeared under the pseudonym Antonio Manuele in a series of concerts held in England.\nL\u00e1zaro built his career primarily on &lt;a href=\"verismo\"&gt;verismo&lt;/a&gt; roles, Verdi operas. He performed in \"Rigoletto\", \"&lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20trovatore\"&gt;Il trovatore&lt;/a&gt;\", Bizet's \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\", some &lt;a href=\"bel%20canto\"&gt;bel canto&lt;/a&gt; roles such as \"La favorite\", \"&lt;a href=\"I%20puritani\"&gt;I puritani&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Huguenots\"&gt;Les Huguenots&lt;/a&gt;\" and Spanish &lt;a href=\"zarzuela\"&gt;zarzuela&lt;/a&gt; (Arrieta's \"Marina\", in particular). He created the tenor roles in &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Mascagni\"&gt;Mascagni&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Parisina\"&gt;Parisina&lt;/a&gt;\" (1913, &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;La Scala&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20piccolo%20Marat\"&gt;Il piccolo Marat&lt;/a&gt;\" (1921, Costanzi), and Romani's \"Fedra\" (1915, Costanzi). While in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; in 1924, he received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Giordano\"&gt;Umberto Giordano&lt;/a&gt;, asking him to create the tenor role in his next opera, \"&lt;a href=\"La%20cena%20delle%20beffe\"&gt;La cena delle beffe&lt;/a&gt;\". The opera's premiere was held in December 1924 at La Scala under the baton of &lt;a href=\"Toscanini\"&gt;Toscanini&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second part of L\u00e1zaro's career, stretching from the mid-1920s to his final appearances in 1950, consisted of concerts and performances in Spain, Paris, and Italy. He also made various trips to South America, where he was very popular, especially in Cuba.\nHis repertoire became narrower and narrower from the 1930s onwards, and his voice showed clear signs of decline. Nonetheless, he conserved some of his glory and acclaim through his zarzuela performances. During the 1930s he starred in the zarzuelas, \"Curro Vargas\", \"&lt;a href=\"Do%C3%B1a%20Francisquita\"&gt;Do\u00f1a Francisquita&lt;/a&gt;\", \"La Tempestad\", and the Spanish operas, Bret\u00f3n's \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Dolores\"&gt;La Dolores&lt;/a&gt;\" (1895), Vives' \"Euda d'Uriach\" (1934) and Gaig's \"El estudiante de Salamanca\" (1935). He officially retired from the stage in 1940, but continued to give occasional performances thereafter.\nL\u00e1zaro's last performance was in &lt;a href=\"Havana%2C%20Cuba\"&gt;Havana, Cuba&lt;/a&gt; in 1950 with the \"Marina\", \"Aida\" and \"Rigoletto\". After his retirement, he wrote two books: his autobiography, \"El libro de mi vida\" (1968, \"The book of my life\"), and \"Mi m\u00e9todo de canto\" (1947, \"My singing method\"), a didactical work for student tenors.\nHe died 24 years after his last performances on May 14, 1974 in his native Barcelona. He was 87.\nLegacy.\nL\u00e1zaro had a \"wide-ranging, timbred, considerably vibrant, extended, bold, resilient even if slightly guttural voice,\" according to Paolo Padovan, with a brilliant metallic shine and a passionate approach to singing. When he sang at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%2839th%20St%29\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera House&lt;/a&gt; he was overshadowed by &lt;a href=\"Enrico%20Caruso\"&gt;Enrico Caruso&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he was compared. He also maintained a strong rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Aragonese%20people\"&gt;Aragonese&lt;/a&gt; tenor &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Fleta\"&gt;Miguel Fleta&lt;/a&gt;."
