The Kahans lived at 6 &lt;a href=\"Clapton%20Square\"&gt;Clapton Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hackney%20Central\"&gt;Hackney&lt;/a&gt;, London. She became an active socialist and joined the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Federation\"&gt;Social Democratic Federation&lt;/a&gt; (SDF). Within the SDF, she was a leading opponent of &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Belfort%20Bax\"&gt;Ernest Belfort Bax&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"anti-feminism\"&gt;anti-feminism&lt;/a&gt;, and an ardent anti-militarist. After a resolution she proposed to the conference of the SDF's successor, the &lt;a href=\"British%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;British Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, was approved against the wishes of the party leadership, she was elected to its executive. She worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Rothstein\"&gt;Theodore Rothstein&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and supported the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Communist Party of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; (CPGB).\nKahan married fellow communist &lt;a href=\"William%20Peyton%20Coates\"&gt;William Peyton Coates&lt;/a&gt; (died 8 Aug 1963), and became known as Zelda Coates. Together, they set up the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Russian%20Parliamentary%20Committee\"&gt;Anglo-Russian Parliamentary Committee&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Coates lived at 37 Coolhurst Road, &lt;a href=\"Hornsey\"&gt;Hornsey&lt;/a&gt;, London N8 in later days.\nWorks.\nCo written with W.
