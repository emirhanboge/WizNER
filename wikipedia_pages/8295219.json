It recently announced a &lt;a href=\"The%20Maya%20Declaration\"&gt;Maya Declaration&lt;/a&gt; Commitment to continue with the modernization of the payment system, and submit legislation to regulate and supervise micro finance institutions to relevant authorities in 2013.\nHistory.\nThe Bank of the Republic of Haiti was founded after the independence of Haiti from France. The oldest reference to a bank in Haiti can be attributed to a short correspondence exchanged during September 1825 between a foreign tradesman, Nicholas Kane, the Secretary of State Balthazar Inginac about a proposal made by George Clark in the name of a German group, Hermann Hendrick and Co., to establish a bank in Haiti. However, the proposal was never accepted, and Hermann Hendrick and Co. was never established.\nIn October 1910, a concession was granted to a consortium of French, German and American businessmen for the creation of a new bank, the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BNRH). In 1979, BNRH was split into two financial institutions: the Banque Nationale de Cr\u00e9dit (BNC), a commercial bank, and the Bank of the Republic of Haiti.\nGovernors.\nSource: "
