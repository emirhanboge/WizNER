After training as a torpedo officer, he commanded two different cruisers and then three different battleships before becoming commander of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Battle Squadron&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Fleet\"&gt;Home Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to command the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and then the 2nd Cruiser Squadron.\nJust before the start of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; Sturdee became Chief of War Staff at the &lt;a href=\"British%20Admiralty\"&gt;Admiralty&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a serious defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Coronel\"&gt;Battle of Coronel&lt;/a&gt;. In response Sturdee was sent to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Atlantic%20Station\"&gt;South Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20von%20Spee\"&gt;Maximilian von Spee&lt;/a&gt;, which had caused the damage at Coronel. On 8 December 1914, while coaling at &lt;a href=\"Stanley%2C%20Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Battle of the Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee's forces sank almost the entire German squadron. Only one light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915.\nIn the closing years of the war Sturdee served as commander of the &lt;a href=\"4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;4th Battle Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Fleet\"&gt;Grand Fleet&lt;/a&gt; and then as &lt;a href=\"Commander-in-Chief%2C%20The%20Nore\"&gt;Commander-in-Chief, The Nore&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaval career.\nEarly career.\nBorn the son of Captain Frederick Sturdee RN and Anna Frances Sturdee (n\u00e9e Hodson) in Charlton, Kent, Sturdee was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20School\"&gt;Royal Naval School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"New%20Cross\"&gt;New Cross&lt;/a&gt; and then joined the Royal Navy as a &lt;a href=\"cadet\"&gt;cadet&lt;/a&gt; in the training ship &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20%281860%29\"&gt;HMS \"Britannia\"&lt;/a&gt; on 15 July 1871.

His handling of this situation, which involved a tense stand-off with the German representatives, earned him his promotion to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; on 30 June 1899, and his appointment as a &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George\"&gt;Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1900%20New%20Year%20Honours\"&gt;1900 New Year Honours&lt;/a&gt; list on 1 January 1900 (he was invested in person by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt; on 1 March 1900).\nSturdee returned to the Admiralty as assistant director of naval intelligence (foreign division) from 1 January 1900, serving as such until 16 October 1902, when he was appointed in command of the protected cruiser .

After &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; insisted that Sturdee should not be made a scapegoat for the events at Coronel, Admiral &lt;a href=\"John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher\"&gt;Lord Fisher&lt;/a&gt; sent a squadron commanded by Sturdee, with his flag in the &lt;a href=\"battlecruiser\"&gt;battlecruiser&lt;/a&gt; , to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Atlantic%20Station\"&gt;South Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20von%20Spee\"&gt;Maximilian von Spee&lt;/a&gt;, which had caused the damage at Coronel. This decision was compounded by the fact that Fisher \"detested\" Sturdee and wanted to remove him from the Admiralty. On 8 December 1914, while coaling at &lt;a href=\"Stanley%2C%20Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Battle of the Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee's forces sank almost the entire German squadron, including the &lt;a href=\"Scharnhorst-class%20cruiser\"&gt;armoured cruisers&lt;/a&gt;, and . Only the light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915.
