    "text": "Sir Joseph Larmor (11 July 1857 \u2013 19 May 1942) was an Irish and British &lt;a href=\"physicist\"&gt;physicist&lt;/a&gt; and mathematician who made breakthroughs in the understanding of electricity, &lt;a href=\"dynamics%20%28mechanics%29\"&gt;dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thermodynamics\"&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was \"Aether and Matter\", a theoretical physics book published in 1900.\nBiography.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Magheragall\"&gt;Magheragall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim\"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt; the son of Hugh Larmor, a &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; shopkeeper and his wife, Anna Wright. The family moved to Belfast circa 1860, and he was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Belfast%20Academical%20Institution\"&gt;Royal Belfast Academical Institution&lt;/a&gt;, and then studied mathematics and experimental science at &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Belfast\"&gt;Queen's College, Belfast&lt;/a&gt; (BA 1874, MA 1875), where one of his teachers was &lt;a href=\"John%20Purser%20%28mathematician%29\"&gt;John Purser&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently studied at &lt;a href=\"St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;St John's College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; where in 1880 he was &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Wrangler\"&gt;Senior Wrangler&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Thomson\"&gt;J. J. Thomson&lt;/a&gt; was second wrangler that year) and Smith's Prizeman, getting his MA in 1883. After teaching physics for a few years at &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Galway\"&gt;Queen's College, Galway&lt;/a&gt;, he accepted a lectureship in mathematics at Cambridge in 1885. In 1892 he was elected a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20London\"&gt;Royal Society of London&lt;/a&gt;, and he served as one of the Secretaries of the society. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Royal Society of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; in 1910.\nIn 1903 he was appointed &lt;a href=\"Lucasian%20Professor%20of%20Mathematics\"&gt;Lucasian Professor of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; at Cambridge, a post he retained until his retirement in 1932. He never married. He was knighted by King &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VII\"&gt;Edward VII&lt;/a&gt; in 1909.\nMotivated by his strong opposition to &lt;a href=\"Devolution\"&gt;Home Rule for Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, in February 1911 Larmor ran for and was elected as Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative party&lt;/a&gt;. He remained in parliament until the &lt;a href=\"1922%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1922 general election&lt;/a&gt;, at which point the Irish question had been settled. Upon his retirement from Cambridge in 1932 Larmor moved back to &lt;a href=\"County%20Down\"&gt;County Down&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Ireland.\nHe received the honorary &lt;a href=\"Legum%20Doctor\"&gt;Doctor of Laws&lt;/a&gt; (LLD) from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Glasgow\"&gt;University of Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; in June 1901. He was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Poncelet%20Prize\"&gt;Poncelet Prize&lt;/a&gt; for 1918 by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;French Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Larmor was a Plenary Speaker in 1920 at the &lt;a href=\"International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians\"&gt;ICM&lt;/a&gt; at Strasbourg and an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1924 in Toronto and at the ICM in 1928 in Bologna.\nHe died in &lt;a href=\"Holywood%2C%20County%20Down\"&gt;Holywood, County Down&lt;/a&gt; on 19 May 1942.\nWork.\nLarmor proposed that the &lt;a href=\"Luminiferous%20aether\"&gt;aether&lt;/a&gt; could be represented as a &lt;a href=\"Homogeneous%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;homogeneous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fluid\"&gt;fluid&lt;/a&gt; medium which was perfectly &lt;a href=\"incompressible\"&gt;incompressible&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elasticity%20%28physics%29\"&gt;elastic&lt;/a&gt;. Larmor believed the aether was separate from matter. He united &lt;a href=\"William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin\"&gt;Lord Kelvin&lt;/a&gt;'s model of spinning &lt;a href=\"gyrostat\"&gt;gyrostat&lt;/a&gt;s (see &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20theory%20of%20the%20atom\"&gt;Vortex theory of the atom&lt;/a&gt;) with this &lt;a href=\"theory\"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt;. Larmor held that &lt;a href=\"matter\"&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt; consisted of &lt;a href=\"Elementary%20particle\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; moving in the aether. Larmor believed the source of &lt;a href=\"electric%20charge\"&gt;electric charge&lt;/a&gt; was a \"particle\" (which as early as 1894 he was referring to as the &lt;a href=\"electron\"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;). Larmor held that the flow of charged particles constitutes the &lt;a href=\"Current%20%28electricity%29\"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"conductor%20%28material%29\"&gt;conduction&lt;/a&gt; (but was not part of the &lt;a href=\"atom\"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;). Larmor calculated the rate of energy &lt;a href=\"radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"acceleration\"&gt;accelerating&lt;/a&gt; electron. Larmor explained the splitting of the &lt;a href=\"spectral%20line\"&gt;spectral line&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20field\"&gt;magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"oscillation\"&gt;oscillation&lt;/a&gt; of electrons. \nLarmor also created the first solar system model of the atom in 1897. He also postulated the proton, calling it a \u201cpositive electron.\u201d He said the destruction of this type of atom making up matter \u201cis an occurrence of infinitely small probability.\u201d\nIn 1919, Larmor proposed &lt;a href=\"sunspot\"&gt;sunspot&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"Regenerative%20circuit\"&gt;self-regenerative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dynamo\"&gt;dynamo&lt;/a&gt; action on the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;'s surface.\nQuotes from one of Larmor's voluminous work include:\nDiscovery of Lorentz transformation.\nParallel to the development of &lt;a href=\"Lorentz%20ether%20theory\"&gt;Lorentz ether theory&lt;/a&gt;, Larmor published an approximation to the &lt;a href=\"Lorentz%20transformation\"&gt;Lorentz transformation&lt;/a&gt;s in the \"&lt;a href=\"Philosophical%20Transactions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society\"&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1897,\nnamely formula_1 for the spatial part and formula_2 for the temporal part, where formula_3 and the local time formula_4. He obtained the full Lorentz transformation in 1900 by inserting formula_5 into his expression of local time such that formula_6, and as before formula_7 and formula_8. This was done around the same time as &lt;a href=\"Hendrik%20Lorentz\"&gt;Hendrik Lorentz&lt;/a&gt; (1899, 1904) and five years before &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt; (1905).\nLarmor however did not possess the correct velocity transformations, which include the addition of velocities law, which were later discovered by &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9\"&gt;Henri Poincar\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Larmor predicted the &lt;a href=\"phenomenon\"&gt;phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"time%20dilation\"&gt;time dilation&lt;/a&gt;, at least for orbiting electrons, by writing (Larmor 1897): \"... individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\"v\"2/\"c\"2)1/2\". He also verified that the &lt;a href=\"FitzGerald%E2%80%93Lorentz%20contraction\"&gt;FitzGerald\u2013Lorentz contraction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"length%20contraction\"&gt;length contraction&lt;/a&gt;) should occur for bodies whose atoms were held together by electromagnetic forces. In his book \"Aether and Matter\" (1900), he again presented the Lorentz transformations, time dilation and length contraction (treating these as dynamic rather than &lt;a href=\"kinematic\"&gt;kinematic&lt;/a&gt; effects). Larmor was opposed to the &lt;a href=\"spacetime\"&gt;spacetime&lt;/a&gt; interpretation of the Lorentz transformation in &lt;a href=\"special%20relativity\"&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt; because he continued to believe in an absolute aether. He was also critical of the &lt;a href=\"space-time\"&gt;curvature of space&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"general%20relativity\"&gt;general relativity&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that he claimed that an absolute time was essential to astronomy (Larmor 1924, 1927).\nPublications.\nLarmor edited the collected works of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20George%20Stokes%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;George Stokes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Thomson%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;James Thomson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin\"&gt;William Thomson&lt;/a&gt;."
