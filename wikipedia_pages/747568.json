    "text": "Volker R\u00fche (born 25 September 1942) is a German politician of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Christian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; (CDU). He served as &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defence%20Minister%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Defence minister&lt;/a&gt; from 1 April 1992, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Stoltenberg\"&gt;Gerhard Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt; during the first &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;reunified&lt;/a&gt; Germany in the fourth &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20Kohl%20IV\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chancellor\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Kohl\"&gt;Kohl&lt;/a&gt;, to the end of the fifth &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20Kohl%20V\"&gt;Kohl Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; on 27 October 1998. During his time at the Defence Ministry R\u00fche played a central role in placing &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; enlargement on the German political agenda. He unsuccessfully ran for the office of &lt;a href=\"minister-president\"&gt;minister-president&lt;/a&gt; of the German state &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2000, eventually losing against incumbent &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Simonis\"&gt;Heide Simonis&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly political career.\nFrom 1976 to 2005 R\u00fche was a member of the German &lt;a href=\"Bundestag\"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;. After the Christian Democrats returned to power in 1982, he joined the &lt;a href=\"CDU/CSU\"&gt;CDU/CSU&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary group's leadership under its new chairman &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Dregger\"&gt;Alfred Dregger&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the leadership of CDU chairman and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, R\u00fche held the position of Secretary General of his party from 1989 until 1992, including during the period of &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt;. In this capacity, he succeeded &lt;a href=\"Heiner%20Geissler\"&gt;Heiner Geissler&lt;/a&gt; and was put in charge of administrative matters and electoral tactics. At a party convention in late 1992, the CDU surprisingly replaced R\u00fche with Heinz Eggert, a representative from East Germany, as one of Kohl's four deputies.\nFederal Minister of Defence, 1992-1998.\nAs Germany's longest-serving defense minister, R\u00fche oversaw the country's integration of the former East German army, expanded Germany's role within NATO and was an early proponent of NATO's expansion eastward. He also proposed more spending on defense and won public backing as well as cross-party support for a Bundeswehr role in international peacekeeping, thus overcoming a German aversion to the use of force\u2014in any circumstances\u2014prevalent after 1945.\nDuring his time in office, German military forces were engaged in numerous UN-linked operations outside the NATO region, including 1,700 soldiers in &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Operation%20in%20Somalia%20II\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; (logistic support); 122 in &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; (medical unit); two ships with combined crews totaling 420 people in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Maritime%20Guard\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; (air-navy patrol); 60 in &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Protection%20Force\"&gt;Bosnia-Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; (relief flights), and 40 in &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Iraq%E2%80%93Kuwait%20Observation%20Mission\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; (UN monitoring staff).\nR\u00fche frequently expressed frustration with restrictions on German troops joining international peacekeeping missions and faced public criticism of the increasing deployment of German military forces abroad. In 1992, the SPD (unsuccessfully) filed a legal challenge in the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Constitutional%20Court\"&gt;Federal Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the deployment of German forces in the Adriatic violated their constitutional limits on their use. Later, R\u00fche had to inform the German public in October 1993 about the death of Sgt. Alexander Arndt, a 26-year-old army medic; Arndt had become the first German soldier to die on duty in an area of tension since &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; after he was shot by an unknown assailant in Cambodia.\nUnder R\u00fche's leadership, Germany began destroying stockpiles of tanks and other heavy weapons in August 1992, becoming the first country to implement the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. After failing narrowly to stop the &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter%20Typhoon\"&gt;Eurofighter Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; project when he took office in 1992, R\u00fche negotiated down the number of aircraft the air force ordered, as well as the cost of each. In 1993, he canceled plans to buy Lapas, a $1 billion American-designed high-altitude reconnaissance system, after it was revealed that the system's German subcontractor was at the center of a political scandal about reported bribery of Bavarian Minister-President &lt;a href=\"Max%20Streibl\"&gt;Max Streibl&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1997, R\u00fche suspended a lieutenant general and instituted disciplinary action against a colonel after it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Manfred%20Roeder\"&gt;Manfred Roeder&lt;/a&gt;, a neo-Nazi with a criminal record of bombings, had been invited to give a speech to the country's most prestigious military academy in 1995.\nLater political career.\nBetween 1998 and 2000, R\u00fche served as the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\nBy 2000, R\u00fche was considered a potential opponent of &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Merkel\"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; for the CDU leadership; however, he eventually dropped out of the race.\nIn 2004, R\u00fche from the opposition was named by the government of &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der\"&gt;Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&lt;/a&gt; to lead Germany's campaign for a permanent seat on the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Schr\u00f6der sent R\u00fche to Moscow for talks with &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Russia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Revolution\"&gt;Orange Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Between 2014 and 2015, he headed a crossparty committee to review the country's parliamentary rules on military deployments.\nPolitical positions.\nDomestic policy.\nDomestically, R\u00fche was an outspoken advocate of tighter immigration laws.\nIn 2000, as part of the search for a new chair of the CDU, R\u00fche led an effort to stop frontrunner &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Merkel\"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; that included overtures to &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Biedenkopf\"&gt;Kurt Biedenkopf&lt;/a&gt; to serve as an interim leader. Ahead of the party's &lt;a href=\"2018%20Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany%20leadership%20election\"&gt;leadership election&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, Biedenkopf publicly endorsed &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Merz\"&gt;Friedrich Merz&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Merkel as chair.\nForeign policy.\nIn 1985, R\u00fche strongly urged that Europe's four major powers \u2013 France, Britain, Italy and West Germany \u2013 formulate a common European position on the &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Reagan Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative\"&gt;Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1995, R\u00fche withdrew an invitation for his Moscow counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Grachev\"&gt;Pavel Grachev&lt;/a&gt;, to visit Germany after Grachev insulted leading critics of the war in &lt;a href=\"Chechnya\"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, this was regarded as throwing into question German-Russian military cooperation on European security issues following the country's reunification. During the &lt;a href=\"Grozny%20ballistic%20missile%20attack\"&gt;Grozny ballistic missile attack&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, R\u00fche called for freezing Western loans to Russia.\nIn 2013, R\u00fche appeared alongside &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Federation\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"President%20%28government%20title%29\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Fillon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Valdai%20Discussion%20Club\"&gt;Valdai Discussion Club&lt;/a&gt;. He was quoted by \"&lt;a href=\"Neue%20Presse\"&gt;Neue Presse&lt;/a&gt;\" expressing sympathy for Putin and arguing for an intensive &lt;a href=\"dialogue\"&gt;dialogue&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20Merkel%20I\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; government and \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Kremlin\"&gt;the Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;\" on the subject of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; proposed \"&lt;a href=\"missile\"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt; defense &lt;a href=\"National%20missile%20defense\"&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;\". \"We are talking as if &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; already had &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20weapon\"&gt;nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt;s... we can't continue with &lt;a href=\"Deterrence%20theory\"&gt;deterrence&lt;/a&gt;, like during &lt;a href=\"the%20Cold%20War\"&gt;the Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.\" In 2015, he joined other foreign policy experts, including &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Ivanov\"&gt;Igor Ivanov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Palacio\"&gt;Ana Palacio&lt;/a&gt;, in calling for a possible Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the Russian Federation on the Rules of Behaviour for the Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters between the two sides.\nIn a 2019 interview, R\u00fche blamed his successor &lt;a href=\"Karl-Theodor%20zu%20Guttenberg\"&gt;Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg&lt;/a&gt; for \"having destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr\"&gt;Bundeswehr&lt;/a&gt;\"."
