    "text": "Edgar Mart\u00ednez (born January 2, 1963), nicknamed \"Gar\" and \"Papi\", is an American former &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt;. He played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) as a &lt;a href=\"designated%20hitter\"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt; from 1987 through 2004. He served as the Mariners' hitting coach from 2015 through 2018.\nMart\u00ednez grew up in &lt;a href=\"Dorado%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Dorado, Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. Not highly regarded as a &lt;a href=\"prospect%20%28sports%29\"&gt;prospect&lt;/a&gt;, he signed with the Mariners as a &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, and was given a small &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt;. He made his major league debut in 1987, but did not establish himself as a full-time player until 1990, at age 27. In the &lt;a href=\"1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;1995 American League Division Series&lt;/a&gt;, he hit \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Double%20%28Seattle%20Mariners%29\"&gt;The Double&lt;/a&gt;\", which won the series and increased public support for Mariners baseball as they attempted to fund a new stadium. He continued to play until 2004, when injuries forced him to retire.\nMart\u00ednez was a seven-time &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;MLB All-Star&lt;/a&gt;, five-time &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Slugger%20Award\"&gt;Silver Slugger&lt;/a&gt;, and two-time &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions\"&gt;batting champion&lt;/a&gt;. He is one of 18 MLB players to record a &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; of .300, an &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; of .400, and a &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt; of .500 in 5,000 or more &lt;a href=\"plate%20appearance\"&gt;plate appearance&lt;/a&gt;s. The Mariners retired his &lt;a href=\"uniform%20number\"&gt;uniform number&lt;/a&gt; and inducted him into the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. Mart\u00ednez was elected into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.\nEarly life.\nMart\u00ednez was born in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; on January 2, 1963, to Jos\u00e9 and Christina Salgado Martinez, who were from &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and he was taken in by his grandparents, who lived in the &lt;a href=\"barrios%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;barrio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maguayo\"&gt;Maguayo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dorado%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Dorado, Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. Mart\u00ednez taught himself how to speak English and how to use computers. When he was 11 years old, his parents reconciled. His brother and sister returned to New York to live with their parents, but Edgar opted to remain in Dorado with his grandparents.\nMartinez became inspired to play baseball after watching fellow Puerto Rican &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente\"&gt;Roberto Clemente&lt;/a&gt; play in the &lt;a href=\"1971%20World%20Series\"&gt;1971 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. He played with his cousin &lt;a href=\"Carmelo%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Carmelo Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; in the backyard of his home. &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;Scouts&lt;/a&gt; watched Carmelo with interest, but Edgar did not draw their attention. He attended the &lt;a href=\"Interamerican%20University%20of%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Interamerican University of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, studying business administration. He played &lt;a href=\"semiprofessional\"&gt;semiprofessional&lt;/a&gt; baseball and worked two jobs, as a supervisor in a furniture store by day and in a &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt; factory at night.\nProfessional career.\nProspect.\nAt the suggestion of the owner of his semiprofessional team, Mart\u00ednez attended a tryout held by the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners\"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB). Despite nearly missing the tryout after a long night working at the factory and being \"so tired [he] couldn't swing the bat,\" The Mariners signed him to a contract with a $4,000 &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt; (a small amount at the time) on December 12, 1982. He initially considered declining the offer, due to the money he was making in Puerto Rico, but Carmelo convinced him to sign.\nMart\u00ednez made his professional debut in &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Minor League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Bellingham%20Mariners\"&gt;Bellingham Mariners&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Class%20A-Short%20Season\"&gt;Class A-Short Season&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20League\"&gt;Northwest League&lt;/a&gt; in 1983 as a third baseman. He had a .173 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt;, zero home runs and only 18 hits. The scout who signed Mart\u00ednez convinced &lt;a href=\"Hal%20Keller\"&gt;Hal Keller&lt;/a&gt;, the Mariners' &lt;a href=\"general%20manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;general manager&lt;/a&gt;, to assign him to the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Instructional%20League\"&gt;Arizona Instructional League&lt;/a&gt; (AIL) after the season. Keller did not believe Mart\u00ednez would be able to hit in the major leagues, and initially did not want to assign him to the AIL, which is reserved for the best &lt;a href=\"prospect%20%28sports%29\"&gt;prospects&lt;/a&gt;. Keller included Mart\u00ednez in the AIL that year, where he batted .340.\nIn 1984, Mart\u00ednez batted .303 with 15 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s and 84 &lt;a href=\"base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Wausau%20Timbers\"&gt;Wausau Timbers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Class%20A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Class A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Midwest%20League\"&gt;Midwest League&lt;/a&gt;. Mart\u00ednez played for the &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%20Lookouts\"&gt;Chattanooga Lookouts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Class%20AA\"&gt;Class AA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Southern%20League%20%281964%E2%80%932020%29\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20Cannons\"&gt;Calgary Cannons&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Class%20AAA\"&gt;Class AAA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; (PCL) in 1985, batting .258 in 111 games for Chattanooga and .353 in 20 games for Calgary. He returned to Chattanooga in 1986 and had a .960 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;, which led all &lt;a href=\"third%20basemen\"&gt;third basemen&lt;/a&gt;. Playing for Calgary in 1987, Mart\u00ednez had a .327 batting average, 10 home runs, and 31 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; in 129 games. He led Calgary in batting average, as well as hits, doubles, batting average, on base percentage, games played, and walks.\nEarly career (1987\u20131989).\nMart\u00ednez made his major league debut on September 12, 1987, as a third baseman, and proceeded to hit .372 over his first 13 career games. However, the Mariners were committed to using &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Presley\"&gt;Jim Presley&lt;/a&gt; as their third baseman. In 1988, Mart\u00ednez began the season with Calgary, but was called up to the major leagues in early May. He played in four games with the Mariners before being returned to Calgary, where he hit .363, the best batting average in the PCL. In September he was called up again, and over 10 games hit .389. In his second MLB season, he hit .281 with a .351 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; (OBP) and a .406 &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt; over 14 games.\nThe Mariners named Mart\u00ednez their starting third baseman on their &lt;a href=\"Opening%20Day\"&gt;Opening Day&lt;/a&gt; roster in 1989. He struggled and was sent back down to Calgary in May. He hit .345 over 32 games for the Cannons and .240 in 65 games for the Mariners in 1989. After the regular season, Mart\u00ednez played winter baseball in the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rican%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Puerto Rican Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;. He batted .424 in 43 games, leading the league, and was named co-&lt;a href=\"most%20valuable%20player\"&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Baerga\"&gt;Carlos Baerga&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst seasons and batting title (1990\u20131992).\nIn 1990, Mart\u00ednez signed a one-year contract for $90,000. Though Presley was no longer a Mariner, &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Coles\"&gt;Darnell Coles&lt;/a&gt; began the season as the Mariners' starting third baseman, with &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Lefebvre\"&gt;Jim Lefebvre&lt;/a&gt; telling \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Seattle%20Times\"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/a&gt;\" during spring training: \"I think Darnell Coles is going to surprise a lot of people. He knows there is no one in the wings, just Edgar Martinez to back him up.\" However, Coles committed five &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle's first six games. Lefebvre moved Coles to the outfield and began playing Mart\u00ednez at third base. Over 144 games, Mart\u00ednez hit .302, and had a .397 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt;, both of which led the team.\nMart\u00ednez signed a two-year contract worth $850,000 before the 1991 season. In 1991, he won his first &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Player%20of%20the%20Week%20Award\"&gt;MLB Player of the Week Award&lt;/a&gt; for the week ending July 14. He finished the 1991 season hitting .307/.405/.452, all career highs. In 1992, Mart\u00ednez was selected to his first &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, and won his first &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Player%20of%20the%20Month%20Award\"&gt;MLB Player of the Month Award&lt;/a&gt; for July and his second for August, During the season, Mart\u00ednez signed a three-year contract with Seattle worth $10\u00a0million, the largest contract given out by Seattle to that point.\nAt the end of the 1992 season, Mart\u00ednez had a .343 batting average, which led all of MLB. It was the first &lt;a href=\"batting%20title\"&gt;batting title&lt;/a&gt; for Seattle and the franchise's highest single-season batting average (this has since been surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Ichiro%20Suzuki\"&gt;Ichiro Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;). He also tied &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Thomas%20%28designated%20hitter%29\"&gt;Frank Thomas&lt;/a&gt; for the most doubles in MLB, and set a team record for most in a season (this has since been surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Rodriguez\"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;). After the season, he was awarded his first &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; (AL) &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Slugger%20Award\"&gt;Silver Slugger Award&lt;/a&gt; as a third basemen.\nInjuries (1993\u20131994).\nDuring an exhibition game at &lt;a href=\"BC%20Place%20Stadium\"&gt;BC Place Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, before the 1993 season, Mart\u00ednez tore his &lt;a href=\"hamstring\"&gt;hamstring&lt;/a&gt; on an unzipped seam in the turf between first and second base. He missed 42 games at the start of the season, and was placed on the disabled list two more times before the season ended. In 1994, in his first plate appearance of the season, opposing pitcher &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Dennis Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; hit him in the right wrist, and he was placed on the disabled list. Between the injuries and the &lt;a href=\"1994%20MLB%20strike\"&gt;1994 MLB strike&lt;/a&gt;, he played in 131 games during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. In 89 games played in 1994, he played 65 games as a third baseman and 23 as a &lt;a href=\"designated%20hitter\"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt;, with one appearance as a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20runner\"&gt;pinch runner&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer year (1995).\nMart\u00ednez became a full-time designated hitter in 1995. He won the Player of the Month Award for June, hitting .402 with a .537 OBP and a .761 SLG, and another Player of the Week Award. He was also selected to the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1995 All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; and set career highs in eleven offensive categories. At the end of the year he won his second AL batting title with a team record .356, while also leading the league in &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs scored&lt;/a&gt; with 121, doubles with 52, OBP with .479 and &lt;a href=\"on-base%20plus%20slugging\"&gt;on-base plus slugging&lt;/a&gt; (OPS) with 1.109 (all team highs at that point). He also finished third in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;AL Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt; voting behind &lt;a href=\"Mo%20Vaughn\"&gt;Mo Vaughn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Belle\"&gt;Albert Belle&lt;/a&gt;. He won his second &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Slugger%20Award\"&gt;Silver Slugger Award&lt;/a&gt; and his first &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Award\"&gt;Outstanding Designated Hitter Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Double.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;1995 American League Division Series&lt;/a&gt; (ALDS) against the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, Mart\u00ednez hit .571 and was on base 18 times in five games. In Game 4 of that series, he hit a three-run home run, then a &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; home run that broke a 6\u20136 tie, en route to an 11\u20138 victory. His seven &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt; (RBIs) in that game tied a single-game postseason record. The win knotted the best-of-five series at two games apiece and forced Game 5. Down 5\u20134 in the 11th inning of that decisive game, Mart\u00ednez hit a two-run double off &lt;a href=\"Jack%20McDowell\"&gt;Jack McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, winning the game for the Mariners, 6\u20135, and series, 3\u20132. The win sent the Mariners to the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;American League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in franchise history, against the Cleveland Indians, a series they would eventually lose in six games.\nThe double entered baseball lore, referred to as \"The Double\", by Mariners fans. The Mariners' 1995 postseason run helped build the groundswell of public support that led the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;Washington State Legislature&lt;/a&gt; to enact legislation to fund &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile%20Park\"&gt;a dedicated baseball stadium in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href=\"Kingdome\"&gt;Kingdome&lt;/a&gt;. Mariners' manager &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Piniella\"&gt;Lou Piniella&lt;/a&gt; referred to it as \"the hit, the run, the game, the series and the season that saved baseball in Seattle.\"\nContinued success (1996\u20132001).\nIn 1996, Mart\u00ednez batted .327 and was selected for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1996 MLB All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. He played one game at third base during the season, during which he collided with &lt;a href=\"John%20Marzano\"&gt;John Marzano&lt;/a&gt;, breaking four ribs and missing 21 games. On August 21, 1996, Mart\u00ednez recorded his 1,000th career MLB hit. Mart\u00ednez was selected to the &lt;a href=\"1997%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;1997 MLB All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; and won the Silver Slugger Award at the end of the 1997 season. He finished second in the AL with a .330 average. The Mariners made the &lt;a href=\"1997%20ALDS\"&gt;1997 ALDS&lt;/a&gt;, but lost to the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt; in four games. Mart\u00ednez batted .188 in the series. He won his second Outstanding Designated Hitter Award. In 1998, Mart\u00ednez batted .320 with 29 home runs. He led the AL with a .429 OBP, and won his third Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.\nIn 1999, Mart\u00ednez was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"strabismus\"&gt;strabismus&lt;/a&gt;, a condition which causes the eyes to not properly align. For Mart\u00ednez, his right eye would intermittently drift and cause him to lose depth perception. For the 1999 season, he led the AL with a .447 OBP and batted .337. He recorded his 1,500th hit on August 14. In 2000, Mart\u00ednez earned his fifth All-Star Game selection. He hit 37 home runs, his single-season best, and led the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; with 145 RBIs. The Mariners reached the postseason, and Mart\u00ednez batted .364 in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20ALDS\"&gt;2000 ALDS&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;. The Mariners lost to the Yankees in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;2000 American League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (ALCS). Mart\u00ednez finished sixth in AL MVP Award balloting, and won the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.\nIn 2001, Mart\u00ednez was again elected to the All-Star Game. He batted .306 with 116 RBIs, his tenth season with a .300 or better batting average (his seventh consecutive) and his sixth season with 100 RBIs. Seattle tied the major league record set by the &lt;a href=\"1906%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season\"&gt;1906 Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; with 116 wins on the season. Mart\u00ednez hit .313 with two home runs in the &lt;a href=\"2001%20ALDS\"&gt;2001 ALDS&lt;/a&gt; as Seattle defeated Cleveland, but he batted .150 in the &lt;a href=\"2001%20ALCS\"&gt;2001 ALCS&lt;/a&gt; as they lost to the Yankees. He won the Silver Slugger Award and the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award in 2001.\nLater career (2002\u20132004).\nMart\u00ednez dealt with leg injuries in 2002, playing in 97 games. He left a game after pulling his &lt;a href=\"hamstring\"&gt;hamstring&lt;/a&gt; and had surgery to repair a ruptured tendon in his left knee. Though he was batting .301 on September 8, he entered a slump late in the season and ended the year with a .277 batting average. In 2003, Mart\u00ednez again dealt with hamstring injuries. He batted .304 in the first half of the season and was named to the &lt;a href=\"2003%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2003 MLB All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;. On May 2, Mart\u00ednez had his 2,000th career hit. He broke a toe when it was hit by a &lt;a href=\"foul%20ball\"&gt;foul ball&lt;/a&gt; in September, which limited him until the end of the season. He ended the season with a .294 batting average, 24 home runs, and a .403 OBP. He won his fifth Silver Slugger Award in 2003.\nIn 2004, Mart\u00ednez struggled with a sore back, leg injuries, and difficulties with his eyesight. The Mariners struggled, falling out of the postseason chase, and the team began to give playing time at designated hitter to &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Jacobsen\"&gt;Bucky Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt;. On August 9, 2004, Mart\u00ednez announced his retirement, effective at the end of the season. Mart\u00ednez said this about his choice of retiring and career in Seattle:\nMart\u00ednez won the &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente%20Award\"&gt;Roberto Clemente Award&lt;/a&gt; after the 2004 season.\nCoaching (2015\u20132018).\nOn June 20, 2015, the Mariners hired Mart\u00ednez as their hitting coach, reassigning &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Howard Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. The team's offense improved from a .233 batting average and 3.4 runs scored per game in the 68 games coached by Johnson to a .260 average and 4.6 runs per game with Mart\u00ednez in 94 games. Though &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Dipoto\"&gt;Jerry Dipoto&lt;/a&gt;, newly hired as general manager, fired &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20McClendon\"&gt;Lloyd McClendon&lt;/a&gt; as manager after the season, he retained Mart\u00ednez. Mart\u00ednez coached the Mariners through to the end of the 2018 season. Out of a desire to spend more time with his family, Mart\u00ednez moved from hitting coach to a hitting advisor role with the Mariners organization after the 2018 season.\nLegacy.\nHall of Fame pitcher &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Rivera\"&gt;Mariano Rivera&lt;/a&gt;, when asked whether there was anyone he was afraid to face, said that he was never afraid, but \"I will put it like this: The only guy that I didn't want to face, when a tough situation comes, was Edgar Mart\u00ednez. The reason is because I couldn't get him out. (laughs) I couldn't get him out. It didn't matter how I threw the ball. I couldn't get him out. Oh, my god, he had more than my number. He had my breakfast, lunch and dinner. He got everything from me.\" Versus Rivera, Mart\u00ednez was able to log a .579 batting average, with 11 hits during 19 at bats. Hall of Fame pitcher &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Pedro Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; (no relation) also named Edgar Mart\u00ednez as one of the toughest hitters he had to pitch against in his career because, Pedro said, he was very disciplined at the plate and \"would &lt;a href=\"foul%20ball\"&gt;foul off&lt;/a&gt; pitches that would wipe out anybody else.\"\nMart\u00ednez was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20Heritage%20Baseball%20Museum\"&gt;Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum&lt;/a&gt; Hall of Fame on September 9, 2003, in a pregame on field ceremony at &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile%20Park\"&gt;Safeco Field&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2004, following his retirement, a section of South Atlantic Street (&lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Route%20519\"&gt;State Route 519&lt;/a&gt;) in Seattle adjacent to Safeco Field was renamed Edgar Mart\u00ednez Drive South. At his retirement ceremony, a portrait \"featuring his high stepping batting style\" painted by artist &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Rushworth\"&gt;Michele Rushworth&lt;/a&gt; was presented to him by the Mariners. In 2004, MLB renamed the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award in Mart\u00ednez's honor. In 2005, fans voted Mart\u00ednez as the third baseman on the &lt;a href=\"Latino%20Legends%20Team\"&gt;Latino Legends Team&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince his retirement, the Mariners did not issue Martinez' &lt;a href=\"uniform%20number\"&gt;uniform number&lt;/a&gt; 11 to any other player. Under Mariners' team policy, he was not eligible to have his uniform number formally retired until 2010, when he became eligible for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. The Mariners inducted Mart\u00ednez into the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Mariners%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; on June 2, 2007, and retired Martinez's #11 jersey on August 12, 2017.\nFirst eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting\"&gt;2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting&lt;/a&gt;, and with 75% of the vote required for induction, Mart\u00ednez received 36.2% of the vote. While some sports writers felt that his batting numbers do not overcome the one-dimensional aspect of his career as a DH, others have compared this to the specialty of closers whose contribution to their teams victories resides on working one inning to preserve an advantage and the fact that these late inning relievers are not involved in other facets of the game such as hitting and base running. By the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting\"&gt;2018 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting&lt;/a&gt;, his ninth year on the ballot, Mart\u00ednez's vote total increased to 70.4%. The &lt;a href=\"2019%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting\"&gt;2019 ballot&lt;/a&gt;, his last chance for election by the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Baseball Writers' Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, elected him to the Hall of Fame, appearing on 85.4% of the ballots cast. He became the second player to enter the Hall of Fame as a Mariner, after &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Griffey%20Jr.\"&gt;Ken Griffey Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and the sixth player to be elected in his final year of eligibility, after &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ruffing\"&gt;Red Ruffing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Medwick\"&gt;Joe Medwick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Kiner\"&gt;Ralph Kiner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Rice\"&gt;Jim Rice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Raines\"&gt;Tim Raines&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, he entered the Hall with the aforementioned Rivera, who was elected in his 1st year of eligibility, along with the late &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Halladay\"&gt;Roy Halladay&lt;/a&gt; (1st ballot, posthumous).\nA &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Edgar%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; of Mart\u00ednez was installed outside Seattle's T-Mobile Park in 2021.\nThe , named after Mart\u00ednez, was built in barrio Higuillar in Dorado. Sustaining structural damages as a result of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Maria\"&gt;Hurricanes Maria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Irma\"&gt;Irma&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, a $700,000 restoration of the sports complex was completed in 2021.
