    "title": "Bliss\u2013Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo",
    "text": "The Bliss\u2013Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo was the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s first 21-inch by 21-foot &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;. Although introduced prior to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, most of its combat use was by &lt;a href=\"PT%20boats\"&gt;PT boats&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The torpedo was originally designed in 1911 by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20McDowell%20Leavitt\"&gt;Frank McDowell Leavitt&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"E.%20W.%20Bliss%20Company\"&gt;E. W. Bliss Company&lt;/a&gt; and entered full mass production in 1913 at the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Torpedo%20Station\"&gt;Naval Torpedo Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. It was deployed on &lt;a href=\"destroyers\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"battleships\"&gt;battleships&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s built in the 1920s. All US battleships and most cruisers had their torpedo tubes removed by 1941. The Mark 8 remained in service through World War II on older destroyers, primarily the &lt;a href=\"Wickes-class%20destroyer\"&gt;\"Wickes\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clemson-class%20destroyer\"&gt;\"Clemson\"&lt;/a&gt; classes. It also equipped &lt;a href=\"PT%20boat\"&gt;PT boat&lt;/a&gt;s early in World War II, but was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Mark%2013%20torpedo\"&gt;Mark 13 torpedo&lt;/a&gt; on most of these in mid-1943.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Lend-Lease\"&gt;Lend-Lease&lt;/a&gt; Act, about 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the United Kingdom for use with 50 pre-1930 destroyers it received under the &lt;a href=\"Destroyers%20for%20Bases%20Agreement\"&gt;Destroyers for Bases Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe design was originally intended to be used on &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s in an anti-&lt;a href=\"surface%20ship\"&gt;surface ship&lt;/a&gt; role. When it was first released, it was a highly advanced torpedo, but when it was actually deployed into service during World War II it was showing its age and unable to compete with modern torpedo technology. The low speed of the torpedo was one of the complaints; its Japanese counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Type%2093%20torpedo\"&gt;Type 93 torpedo&lt;/a&gt;, was significantly faster and more difficult to spot in the water.\nDeployment difficulties.\nThe Mark 8 had many technical difficulties with its design that would be a bane to the torpedomen who would use them. The first issue came with the process of simply launching the torpedo, which was fraught with its own set of difficulties. The &lt;a href=\"Gyroscope\"&gt;gyro&lt;/a&gt; in the torpedo was sensitive when it was first launched and it would need to be launched from an even &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise the torpedo would lose stability when it hit the water. The other issue concerned the launching mechanism. The initial system was set with a &lt;a href=\"black%20powder\"&gt;black powder&lt;/a&gt; charge to push the torpedo out of the tube. This was a problem in the &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;South Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, where the humid climate would cause these charges to misfire, sometimes not putting enough force behind the torpedo to fully eject it from the tube. One other risk of these misfires was what is called \"hot running\", where the torpedo would run in its tube. Though the &lt;a href=\"warhead\"&gt;warhead&lt;/a&gt; could not detonate, the motor would overheat and explode without water to cool it, sending splinters across the deck. Another issue was that the tubes were heavily lubricated with oil and grease to ensure that the torpedo was smoothly launched from the tube. Sometimes during launch, the charge would ignite the lubricants in the tube causing a fire emitting black smoke that would reveal the location of the torpedo boat.\nThe torpedo lacked the explosive power of newer models. It carried less than 500 pounds of TNT-based explosives, which was far from a guaranteed ship kill. This frustrated many captains who, when hitting an enemy dead on, had the warhead detonate but not sink the target, and many targets escaped."
