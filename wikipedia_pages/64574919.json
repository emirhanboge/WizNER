    "text": "Mali-400 MP is a &lt;a href=\"Mali%20%28GPU%29\"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; series &lt;a href=\"Graphics%20processing%20unit\"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt; produced by &lt;a href=\"Arm%20Holdings\"&gt;ARM Holdings&lt;/a&gt;.\nIs one of the world's most shipped mobile GPUs across multiple platforms. It was the first Mali GPU to offer multi-core implementation. The Mali-400 GPU scaled from 1\u20134 cores and was the world\u2019s first OpenGL ES 2.0 conformant multi core GPU. Focusing on reduced power and bandwidth consumption, the Mali-400 GPU was selected for reduced cost devices.\nThere are several versions, the MP1 and the MP4, the most common and used, is the quad-core version, \"Multi-core\" also called \"Mali-400 MP4\" with frequencies ranging from 210 &lt;a href=\"MegaHertz\"&gt;Mhz&lt;/a&gt; to 500 Mhz, develop respectively 12 &lt;a href=\"GigaFLOPS\"&gt;Gigaflops&lt;/a&gt; and 18 Gigaflops of computing power. Semiconductors are manufactured by ARM Holdings, and ARM &lt;a href=\"Application-specific%20integrated%20circuit\"&gt;ASIC&lt;/a&gt; partner licenses. The core is mainly developed by ARM, at the former Falanx company.\nIt is the world's first &lt;a href=\"OpenGL%20ES%202.0\"&gt;OpenGL ES 2.0&lt;/a&gt;-compliant &lt;a href=\"Multi-core%20processor\"&gt;multi-core&lt;/a&gt; GPU capable of delivering 2D and &lt;a href=\"3D%20acceleration\"&gt;3D acceleration&lt;/a&gt; with performance up to &lt;a href=\"1080p\"&gt;1080p&lt;/a&gt; resolution.\nIt is a pure &lt;a href=\"3D%20engine\"&gt;3D engine&lt;/a&gt; that renders the graphics in memory and passes the rendered image onto another core which manages the display. ARM provides the tools necessary to create OpenGL ES &lt;a href=\"Shader\"&gt;shaders&lt;/a&gt; exact names: Mali GPU Shader Development Studio and Mali GPU Engine User Interface. It is mounted on various &lt;a href=\"System%20on%20a%20chip\"&gt;System-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt; (SoC) including: the &lt;a href=\"Samsung%20Galaxy%20S%20II\"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samsung%20Galaxy%20S%20III\"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S3&lt;/a&gt;."
