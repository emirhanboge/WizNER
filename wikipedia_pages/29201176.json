    "text": "Podalyria calyptrata (locally called keurtjie or water blossom pea) is a small, resilient, fast-growing tree of the &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae (legume)&lt;/a&gt; family. It has velvety silver leaves, bears masses of bright-pink, sweetly scented &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, and is indigenous to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Cape\"&gt;Western Cape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Podalyria calyptrata\" is a small, tough, fast-growing tree around 4 meters in height. The simple, oval leaves are silvery grey and velvety in texture.\nThe bright-pink, strongly fragrant &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are very striking and usually appear in spring (although flowering time varies). The flowers are very strongly fragrant, and their sweet scent can be smelled from afar.\nThe seeds are contained in hard little pods that appear considerably later.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThis tree occurs from &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; northwards as far as &lt;a href=\"Tulbagh\"&gt;Tulbagh&lt;/a&gt; and eastwards across the Cape Fold mountains. It grows amongst &lt;a href=\"fynbos\"&gt;fynbos&lt;/a&gt; and on the verges of &lt;a href=\"Afromontane\"&gt;forests&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultivation.\nOnce established, \"P. calyptrata\" tolerates wind, frost, and drought, but it is healthiest when it gets regular water and it does not grow well in highly salty or alkaline soils. Overall, it is very easy to grow.\nIt makes a good informal &lt;a href=\"hedge\"&gt;hedge&lt;/a&gt; or screen along the edge of a property. It also makes a handsome specimen plant, with its bright flowers and attractive foliage. If planted in full sun and lightly pruned of young shoots, it becomes more bushy. If planted in the shade, it tends to become a taller tree, with less dense foliage.\n\"Podalyria calyptrata\" can easily be propagated from &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;. Allow the seeds to soak briefly in warm water before planting them."
