    "text": "Nights Like This is the third studio album by American singer &lt;a href=\"Stacey%20Q\"&gt;Stacey Q&lt;/a&gt;, released on June 8, 1989 by &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Records\"&gt;Atlantic Records&lt;/a&gt;. It was her last album to be released on the Atlantic label before she went on a hiatus from making music until the release of her album \"&lt;a href=\"Boomerang%20%28Stacey%20Q%20album%29\"&gt;Boomerang&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997). After the moderate commercial success of her album \"&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Machine\"&gt;Hard Machine&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988), Swain decided to pursue a new musical direction. She again worked with &lt;a href=\"Jon%20St.%20James\"&gt;Jon St. James&lt;/a&gt; but also invited other producers, such as &lt;a href=\"Clivill%C3%A9s%20and%20Cole\"&gt;Clivill\u00e9s &amp; Cole&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Gordon or &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Gaitsch\"&gt;Bruce Gaitsch&lt;/a&gt;, to achieve a different sound. \"Nights Like This\" is predominantly influenced by &lt;a href=\"Freestyle%20music\"&gt;freestyle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; music, making it a musical departure from her previous work. The album is, like her album \"Hard Machine\", dedicated to her friend and hair stylist, Danny Medellin, who died in 1988.\nUpon its release, \"Nights Like This\" received generally positive reviews from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, but was a commercial failure. It became her first album not to reach the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20200\"&gt;\"Billboard\" 200&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"&lt;a href=\"Give%20You%20All%20My%20Love\"&gt;Give You All My Love&lt;/a&gt;\", peaked at number sixteen on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs&lt;/a&gt; and number eight on the &lt;a href=\"Dance/Electronic%20Singles%20Sales\"&gt;Singles Sales&lt;/a&gt; chart. Accompanying music videos were released for both, the album version and the Crossover House Mix of the song. \"Heartbeat\" was released as the second single and it became a minor &lt;a href=\"Adult%20contemporary%20music\"&gt;adult contemporary&lt;/a&gt; format radio hit.\nSingles.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Give%20You%20All%20My%20Love\"&gt;Give You All My Love&lt;/a&gt;\" was released as the &lt;a href=\"lead%20single\"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt; from the album on May 25, 1989. The &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; was shot in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. It features Swain dancing with her friends inside a &lt;a href=\"Loft\"&gt;loft apartment&lt;/a&gt;. One of the dancers is &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Chambers\"&gt;Michael Chambers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\nUpon its release, \"Nights Like This\" received generally positive reviews from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, mostly praising its dance club sound. Justin Kantor at &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; gave it two and a half star out of five, calling the songs on the album \"more trend-setting than trend-conscious\" and recommending it to \"club-goers looking for a rhythmically consistent album with just a touch of a pop sensibility.\"\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes."
