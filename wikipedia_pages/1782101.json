    "title": "Billy Yank",
    "text": "Billy Yank or Billy Yankee is the personification of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; soldier (volunteer or Regular) during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The latter part of the name is derived from \"&lt;a href=\"yankee\"&gt;yankee&lt;/a&gt;\", a worldwide slang term for Americans, adapted by American Southerners to refer only to Americans from above the Mason-Dixon Line. Although little evidence exists to suggest that the name was used widely during the Civil War (unlike its rebel counterpart &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Reb\"&gt;Johnny Reb&lt;/a&gt;), early 20th century political cartoonists introduced 'Billy Yank' to symbolize U.S. combatants in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; of the 1860s.\nBilly Yank is usually pictured wearing a regulation U.S. Army blue wool uniform that included the fatigue blouse, a light-weight wool coat with an inside pocket and four brass buttons on the front, with a &lt;a href=\"kepi\"&gt;kepi&lt;/a&gt;-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor."
