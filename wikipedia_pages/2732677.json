    "text": "Kenneth Roy Williams (June 28, 1890 \u2013 January 22, 1959) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. He played as an &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) from 1915 to 1929. Williams began his major league career with the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; before spending the majority of his playing days with the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt;, and ended his career playing for the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In 1922, Williams became the first player in MLB history to &lt;a href=\"30%E2%80%9330%20club\"&gt;hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional baseball career.\nWilliams began his &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; career in at the age of 23, playing for the Regina Red Sox of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Canada%20League\"&gt;Western Canada League&lt;/a&gt;. In , he played for the &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20Eskimos%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Edmonton Eskimos&lt;/a&gt; before moving to the &lt;a href=\"Spokane%20Indians\"&gt;Spokane Indians&lt;/a&gt; in . After posting a .340 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; in 79 games for the Indians, he made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on July 14, &lt;a href=\"1915%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season\"&gt;1915&lt;/a&gt;. He hit for a .242 average in 71 games for the Reds during the peak of the &lt;a href=\"dead-ball%20era\"&gt;dead-ball era&lt;/a&gt; when only 6 players in the league hit above the .300 mark. He played in only 10 games for the Reds in &lt;a href=\"1916%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season\"&gt;1916&lt;/a&gt;, spending most of the season with Spokane and with the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Beavers\"&gt;Portland Beavers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt;. Williams hit 24 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s along with a .313 batting average for Portland in before being purchased by the St. Louis Browns.\nWilliams was drafted into the United States Army in April &lt;a href=\"1918%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1918&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared in only two games for the Browns that season. He returned to the Browns in &lt;a href=\"1919%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1919&lt;/a&gt; and hit .300 with 6 home runs in 65 games. In , Major League Baseball outlawed specialty &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;pitches&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"spitball\"&gt;spitball&lt;/a&gt; and experienced a subsequent jump in the league batting averages as well as home runs. In Williams' first full season as a regular player in &lt;a href=\"1920%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1920&lt;/a&gt;, he posted a .307 batting average along with 10 home runs and 72 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;. He continued to improve in &lt;a href=\"1921%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt; with a .347 batting average with 24 home runs, 117 runs batted in and a career-high .429 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams had the best season of his career in &lt;a href=\"1922%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt;, leading the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; with 39 home runs and 155 runs batted in, as the Browns finished the season one game behind the &lt;a href=\"Pennant%20%28sports%29\"&gt;pennant&lt;/a&gt;-winning &lt;a href=\"1922%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;. 32 of his 39 home runs were hit at &lt;a href=\"Home%20%28sports%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sportsman%27s%20Park\"&gt;Sportsman's Park&lt;/a&gt;. On August 7, 1922, during a game against the &lt;a href=\"1922%20Washington%20Senators%20season\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;, he became the first player in American League history to hit two home runs in one &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;. His 39 home runs topped &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Ruth\"&gt;Babe Ruth&lt;/a&gt;, who had led the league the previous four seasons, although Ruth had been suspended well into the 1922 season by &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%20of%20Baseball\"&gt;Baseball Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis\"&gt;Kenesaw Mountain Landis&lt;/a&gt; for violating a curb on &lt;a href=\"Barnstorm%20%28sports%29\"&gt;barnstorming&lt;/a&gt;. Williams was one of only two players to break Babe Ruth's twelve-year string in which he led the American League in home runs (the other being &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Meusel\"&gt;Bob Meusel&lt;/a&gt;). Also in 1922, Williams also became the first player in major league history to have 30 home runs and 30-plus &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stolen base&lt;/a&gt;s in the same season; a feat which would not be achieved again until &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Mays\"&gt;Willie Mays&lt;/a&gt; accomplished it with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; in .\nIn August &lt;a href=\"1923%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt;, the Washington Senators came into possession of one of Williams' bats and discovered that it had been bored out and plugged with a lighter wood. The bat was turned over to National League umpire &lt;a href=\"George%20Hildebrand\"&gt;George Hildebrand&lt;/a&gt; for investigation and the Senators protested all the victories by the Browns in which Williams had used the bat. Williams explained that he had ordered the bat specially made, but when he received it, he found it to be too heavy, so he plugged it with a lighter wood. He was cited in the 1924 \"Reach Guide\" for using a &lt;a href=\"corked%20bat\"&gt;corked bat&lt;/a&gt;, although major league baseball hadn't ruled plugged bats illegal at the time. He finished the 1923 season with a career-high .357 batting average along with 29 home runs and 91 runs batted in and ended the season 15th in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt; balloting.\nIn November 1924, it was rumored that the Yankees were trying to trade for Williams, which would have teamed him with Ruth to make one of the most powerful home run combinations in baseball. However, St. Louis manager &lt;a href=\"George%20Sisler\"&gt;George Sisler&lt;/a&gt;'s insistence on the Yankees trading &lt;a href=\"Waite%20Hoyt\"&gt;Waite Hoyt&lt;/a&gt; for Williams was too high a price for Yankees owner &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Ruppert\"&gt;Jacob Ruppert&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams had another productive season in &lt;a href=\"1925%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1925&lt;/a&gt;, hitting .331 with 25 home runs and 105 runs batted in, and led the league with a .613 &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Williams continued to hit well for the remainder of his career with St. Louis until December 15, &lt;a href=\"1927%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season\"&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt;, when he was purchased by the Boston Red Sox for $10,000. He played two more seasons for the Red Sox, hitting for a .345 average in &lt;a href=\"1929%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season\"&gt;1929&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 39. Williams returned to the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt; in to play two more seasons for the Portland Beavers before retiring in at the age of 41.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Williams played in 1,397 &lt;a href=\"Games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, accumulating 1,552 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in 4,862 &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;s for a .319 career batting average along with 196 home runs, 916 runs batted in and an &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; of .393. Of his 196 home runs, 142 came at his home park. He retired with a .958 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. As baseball evolved out of the &lt;a href=\"dead-ball%20era\"&gt;dead-ball era&lt;/a&gt;, Williams finished in the top four in the American League in home runs in seven consecutive seasons (1921\u20131927). He posted ten seasons with a batting average above .300, and three seasons in which he scored more than 100 &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt;. As of , Williams' .319 career batting average ranked 53rd all-time in major league history. His .924 career &lt;a href=\"on-base%20plus%20slugging\"&gt;on-base plus slugging&lt;/a&gt; percentage and his .530 career &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt;, ranked 45th and 48th respectively all-time among major league players. Williams holds the St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles single season record for runs batted in with 155 in . He is the St. Louis Browns' all-time leader in on-base percentage (.403), slugging percentage (.558) and OPS (.961). In the 2001 book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Bill%20James%20Historical%20Baseball%20Abstract\"&gt;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Bill%20James\"&gt;Bill James&lt;/a&gt; ranked Williams as the 50th greatest left fielder of all-time.\nPost-baseball.\nWilliams returned to Grants Pass and worked as a &lt;a href=\"police%20officer\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; before becoming owner and operator of the Owl Club, a &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Billiard%20hall\"&gt;billiard parlor&lt;/a&gt; on G Street."
