It is one of a very few sagas to feature a magical flying object\u2014in this case a piece of cloth, amongst many other magical objects. It also features &lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;dwarfs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nIn the summary of Kalinke and Mitchell,\nThe saga relates the amorous liaisons of Gibbon, son of King Vilhjalmr of Frakkland.

Once more Gibbon is mysteriously transported to Grikkland to enjoy Greka's love. When Eskopart reaches maturity and learns of his father's desertion, he vows vengeance. Father and son are reconciled, however, and Eskopart inherits Frakkland.\nOrigins.\nThe saga was probably composed in the fourteenth century and is preserved in twenty-three manuscript fragments dating from the late 14th century to 19th century, the most important of which are AM 355 4to, AM 529 4to and Cod.
