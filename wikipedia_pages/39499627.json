    "text": "The rivalry between South China and TSW Pegasus is the &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"local%20derby\"&gt;local derby&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; between South China and TSW Pegasus (known from 2008 to 2012 as TSW Pegasus, from 2012 to 2015 as Sun Pegasus, and from 2015 to 2020 as Hong Kong Pegasus).\nBackground.\nTSW Pegasus FC was founded as TSW Pegasus FC by various people from the &lt;a href=\"Yuen%20Long%20District%20Council\"&gt;Yuen Long District Council&lt;/a&gt; in 2008, with the help of &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20AA\"&gt;South China&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Lo\"&gt;Steven Lo&lt;/a&gt; and his entertainment company &lt;a href=\"BMA%20Entertainment%20Holdings%20Limited\"&gt;bma&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his spouse &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Leung\"&gt;Canny Leung&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the members of the board. Moreover, players including &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Siu%20Wai\"&gt;Cheng Siu Wai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deng%20Jinghuang\"&gt;Deng Jinghuang&lt;/a&gt; joined TSW Pegasus from South China soon after the club was founded. As a result, matches between them are widely known as rivalry between South China and South China B team.\nHistory.\nDespite TSW Pegasus suffering a 0\u20133 defeat to South China in the first match between the clubs, they went on to win three times over South China in the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Senior%20Challenge%20Shield\"&gt;Senior Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;Hong Kong FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the same season. However, between that season and 20 November 2011, TSW Pegasus never defeated South China. The drought was broken when they won the November match 2\u20131.\nTSW Pegasus was renamed as Sun Pegasus for the 2012\u201313 season. They nearly won the away league match at Hong Kong Stadium, but &lt;a href=\"Dhiego%20de%20Souza%20Martins\"&gt;Dhiego Martins&lt;/a&gt;' controversial goal brought South China a point.\nSun Pegasus was then renamed as Hong Kong Pegasus for the 2015\u201316 season.\nIn 2020, the club's name reverted to TSW Pegasus.\nHonours.\nThese are the major football honours of South China and TSW Pegasus."
