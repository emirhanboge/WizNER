    "text": "Lost Command (aka Les Centurions) is a 1966 American &lt;a href=\"war%20film\"&gt;war film&lt;/a&gt; directed and produced by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Robson%20%28film%20director%29\"&gt;Mark Robson&lt;/a&gt; and starring &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Quinn\"&gt;Anthony Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Delon\"&gt;Alain Delon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Segal\"&gt;George Segal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mich%C3%A8le%20Morgan\"&gt;Mich\u00e8le Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Ronet\"&gt;Maurice Ronet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claudia%20Cardinale\"&gt;Claudia Cardinale&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the best-selling 1960 novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Centurions%20%28Lart%C3%A9guy%20novel%29\"&gt;The Centurions&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Lart%C3%A9guy\"&gt;Jean Lart\u00e9guy&lt;/a&gt;. The film focuses on the story of French paratroopers battling in &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20Algeria\"&gt;French Algeria&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nIn the final moments of the 1954 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu\"&gt;Battle of Dien Bien Phu&lt;/a&gt;, a weakened French battalion awaits a last assault by communist &lt;a href=\"Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Minh\"&gt;Vi\u1ec7t Minh&lt;/a&gt; troops.\nThe battalion commander, &lt;a href=\"Basque%20people\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; Lt. Col. Pierre-No\u00ebl Rasp\u00e9guy (&lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Quinn\"&gt;Anthony Quinn&lt;/a&gt;), has called central headquarters for reinforcements. Headquarters sends only a single plane load of French paratroopers, under the command of Major de Clairefons. Despite Rasp\u00e9guy's attempts to provide covering fire, the paratroopers are slaughtered as they land. Major de Clairefons is killed when his parachute drags him into a &lt;a href=\"minefield\"&gt;minefield&lt;/a&gt;. Rasp\u00e9guy is enraged that General Melies (&lt;a href=\"Jean%20Servais\"&gt;Jean Servais&lt;/a&gt;) sent only one plane, and further believes that Melies intends to make him responsible for the entire debacle at Dien Bien Phu.\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh overrun the French, with the survivors captured and imprisoned. Among Rasp\u00e9guy's friends are military historian Captain Phillipe Esclavier (&lt;a href=\"Alain%20Delon\"&gt;Alain Delon&lt;/a&gt;), Indochina-born Captain Boisfeures (&lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Ronet\"&gt;Maurice Ronet&lt;/a&gt;), surgeon Captain Dia (&lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Heath\"&gt;Gordon Heath&lt;/a&gt;) and Lt. Ben Mahidi (&lt;a href=\"George%20Segal\"&gt;George Segal&lt;/a&gt;), an Algerian-born paratrooper who turns down a Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader's (&lt;a href=\"Burt%20Kwouk\"&gt;Burt Kwouk&lt;/a&gt;) offer for preferential treatment because he is an Arab. Rasp\u00e9guy's leadership keeps the men together in their captivity. When released after a treaty between the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and France, Rasp\u00e9guy leads his men in demolishing a &lt;a href=\"delousing\"&gt;delousing&lt;/a&gt; station that they see as a humiliation.\nUpon his return home to Algeria, Ben Mahidi is disgusted at the treatment of his people, especially when his teenaged brother is machine gunned by the police for painting graffiti in support of independence from France. He deserts from the army to join the rebels of the Algerian &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Algeria%29\"&gt;National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (FLN), becoming a guerrilla leader.\nUpon his own return from Indochina, Lt. Col. Rasp\u00e9guy starts a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Countess\"&gt;Countess&lt;/a&gt; Nathalie de Clairefons (&lt;a href=\"Mich%C3%A8le%20Morgan\"&gt;Mich\u00e8le Morgan&lt;/a&gt;), widow of the Major who died while trying to reinforce Rasp\u00e9guy's battalion. The Countess' military contacts result in Rasp\u00e9guy being given command of the new 10th &lt;a href=\"Regiment\"&gt;Regiment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Paratrooper%23France\"&gt;Parachutistes Coloniaux&lt;/a&gt;, serving under General Melies in the &lt;a href=\"Algerian%20war\"&gt;Algerian war&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe General briefs him that the command is his last chance in the military: if his Regiment fails, Rasp\u00e9guy's career is finished. Rasp\u00e9guy recruits his comrades-in-arms from Indochina and trains his battalion with harsh methods, such as using live ammunition on an &lt;a href=\"assault%20course\"&gt;assault course&lt;/a&gt; to encourage speed and initiative.\nSoon after beginning &lt;a href=\"counter-insurgency\"&gt;counter-insurgency&lt;/a&gt; operations in both urban and rural environments, Esclavier falls in love with Mahidi's sister Aicha (&lt;a href=\"Claudia%20Cardinale\"&gt;Claudia Cardinale&lt;/a&gt;), who is loyal to the FLN and uses her friendship with Esclavier to smuggle explosive detonators. The previously naive Esclavier begins to have a new view of his nation's conduct as the FLN rebels and French parachutists try to outdo each other in breaking the rules of war. Rasp\u00e9guy eventually turns on his old comrades who have become too sympathetic to the FLN. Referred to as General (but still wearing Lt. Col. ranks), Rasp\u00e9guy's last scene shows him receiving a medal while his Regiment is presented with a unit citation. Outside the compound where this is happening Esclavier, who has left the army in disgust, laughs when he sees a child painting a pro-independence slogan on the wall.\nProduction.\nWriting.\nMark Robson bought the novel's film rights for his Red Lion company in March 1963. The screenplay was written by Nelson Gidding, who had previously adapted \"&lt;a href=\"Nine%20Hours%20to%20Rama\"&gt;Nine Hours to Rama&lt;/a&gt;\" for Robson.\nCasting.\nRobson reportedly held off making the film for a year so he could get Anthony Quinn for the lead. \nQuinn's character is loosely based on &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Bigeard\"&gt;Marcel Bigeard&lt;/a&gt;, the actual commander in French Indochina, who led the unit that was the predecessor to the 6th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (the 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion). Bigeard later commanded the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Marine%20Infantry%20Parachute%20Regiment\"&gt;3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment&lt;/a&gt; in French Algeria.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot on location in Spain. &lt;a href=\"technical%20advisor\"&gt;Technical support&lt;/a&gt; was provided by Commandant Ren\u00e9 Lepage, who had served in the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Marine%20Infantry%20Parachute%20Regiment\"&gt;6th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Army\"&gt;French Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelease.\nDespite the novel's success, the release of another film called \"The Centurians\" led to the film's title being changed. At one stage it was going to be \"From Indo-China to the Gates of Algiers\" then \"Not For Honor and Glory\" before it was decided to use \"Lost Command\". It premi\u00e8red in the United States in May 1966. It was released in France a few months later.\nBox Office.\nThe film was not particularly popular in the US, earning rentals of $1,150,000. However, it was the fifth most popular movie at the French box office in 1966, after \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Grande%20Vadrouille\"&gt;La Grande Vadrouille&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dr%20Zhivago%20%28film%29\"&gt;Dr Zhivago&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Is%20Paris%20Burning%3F%20%28film%29\"&gt;Is Paris Burning?&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Fistful%20of%20Dollars\"&gt;A Fistful of Dollars&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCritical reception.\nThe film received mixed reviews. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as mundane concluding it \"is all too reminiscent, except for the labels of name, time and place of the many standard war films that have preceded \"Lost Command\".\"\nSequel.\nIn 1963 Robson also bought the rights to Larteguy's \"The Praetorians\", a follow up to \"The Centurions\"; however, the film was never made."
