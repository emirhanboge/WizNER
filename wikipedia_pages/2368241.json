    "text": "Xilitla is a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; () and town in the state of &lt;a href=\"San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD\"&gt;San Luis Potos\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Huasteca\"&gt;Huasteca&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The town is located at The municipality has an area of and had a population of 51,498 in 2010 of whom 6,576 lived in town of Xilitla.\nXilitla is known for its fertile mountains and springs which create panoramic landscapes throughout the municipality. &lt;a href=\"Las%20Pozas\"&gt;Las Pozas&lt;/a&gt; gardens are a major tourist attraction.\nHistory and Economy.\nThe rugged landscape has partly shielded Xilitla from industrialization, helping preserve its indigenous &lt;a href=\"Huastec%20people\"&gt;Huastec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; cultures and traditional agrarian lifestyles. Most of Xilitla's residents live in over 100 rural villages of several dozen up to several hundred people. About 30,000 people in Xilitla live in indigenous households and about 20,000 of them speak an indigenous language, principally &lt;a href=\"Huastec%20language\"&gt;Huastec&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the speakers of an indigenous language also speak Spanish.\n&lt;a href=\"Augustine\"&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt; missionary activity in the Xilitla area began in 1537 and in 1553 construction began on the St. Augustine Convent. It was built to serve both a religious building and a fortress as the &lt;a href=\"Chichimeca%20war\"&gt;Chichimeca war&lt;/a&gt; was in progress and one of the hostile Chichimeca tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Pame%20people\"&gt;Pame&lt;/a&gt;, lived to the northwest. The convent was attacked and burned by the Indians in 1569 and 1587 and largely abandoned by the Augustines. In the 17th century, the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominicans&lt;/a&gt; made another attempt to evangelize but were unable to overcome the hostility of the Indians. Finally, in the mid-18th century, Fray &lt;a href=\"Jun%C3%ADpero%20Serra\"&gt;Jun\u00edpero Serra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Franciscans\"&gt;Franciscans&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in establishing a permanent missionary presence in the region.\nThe economy is primarily agricultural with the main crops being &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"citrus\"&gt;citrus&lt;/a&gt;. A coffee fair is held in August. A local food specialty is the zacahuil, a giant &lt;a href=\"tamale\"&gt;tamale&lt;/a&gt; (3 to 4 feet long) wrapped in banana leaves and filled with pork on one side and chicken on the other.\nGeography.\nThe town of Xilitla has an elevation of and is located in the eastern slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Gorda\"&gt;Sierra Gorda&lt;/a&gt; mountain range, part of the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Madre%20Oriental\"&gt;Sierra Madre Oriental&lt;/a&gt;. Narrow valleys in the municipality dip to . La Silleta, a prominent thumb-shaped mountain, scalable only with mountain climbing gear, rises to six miles west of the city. The land area in the municipality is largely steep but habitable slopes. To the south and west, Xilitla borders the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Quer%C3%A9taro\"&gt;Quer\u00e9taro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hidalgo%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Hidalgo&lt;/a&gt; states. To the northeast, Xilitla borders flat terrain along the Tancuilin river, and Mexican highway 85.\nThere are a number of &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s and caverns in Xilitla, as well as many natural &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;s. Parakeet Cave, a short walk from the town, is home to a large number of green parrots which leave and re-enter the cave at dawn and dusk every day. The land is largely &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/a&gt; with striations visible on cliffs and roads.\nClimate.\nThe climatic classification for Xilitla is a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; closely bordering a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;). Xilitla's altitude moderates the hot temperatures recorded in nearby areas at lower altitudes. Receiving more than 100 inches (2,500\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually, Xilitla is one of the wettest areas of Mexico. Rainfall occurs throughout the year, with maximum precipitation coming in summer, but winters are not as dry as in many other parts of Mexico.\nLas Pozas.\nThe natural beauty of Xilitla inspired eccentric English artist &lt;a href=\"Edward%20James\"&gt;Edward James&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Las%20Pozas\"&gt;Las Pozas&lt;/a&gt; (\"the Pools\"), a garden in a subtropical rainforest just outside the town of Xilitla. It includes more than of natural waterfalls and pools interspersed with towering &lt;a href=\"surrealist\"&gt;surrealist&lt;/a&gt; sculptures in concrete. James' objective was to create a \"&lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20Eden\"&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/a&gt;\" at Las Pozas. A foundation now owns and operates Las Pozas which is open to the public.\nEdward James house, near the centre of Xilitla is known as El Castillo and is now a hotel.\nMuseo &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Carrington\"&gt;Leonora Carrington&lt;/a&gt;.\nA museum with sculptures of &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Carrington\"&gt;Leonora Carrington&lt;/a&gt; opened October 19, 2018.\nTransportation.\nThe highway to the southwest winds around tight curves through the mountains to &lt;a href=\"Quer%C3%A9taro\"&gt;Quer\u00e9taro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;. Heading northeast from town, the highway winds 10\u00a0km to La Y Griega, a large T-intersection into highway 85. &lt;a href=\"Ciudad%20Valles\"&gt;Ciudad Valles&lt;/a&gt; is 100\u00a0km north along 85, and &lt;a href=\"Tamazunchale\"&gt;Tamazunchale&lt;/a&gt; is 50\u00a0km south. Buses run hourly from the town to &lt;a href=\"Ciudad%20Valles\"&gt;Ciudad Valles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamazunchale\"&gt;Tamazunchale&lt;/a&gt; and several times daily to &lt;a href=\"Monterrey\"&gt;Monterrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD%2C%20San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD\"&gt;San Luis Potos\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tampico\"&gt;Tampico&lt;/a&gt;. More frequent buses are available at Y Griega."
