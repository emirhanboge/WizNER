He was received with enthusiasm by the contemporary French press; he was celebrated in the pages of the \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Figaro\"&gt;Figaro&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"un des plus grands virtuoses de l'art de Paganini\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Courrier\"&gt;Courrier&lt;/a&gt;\" observing that \"ce jeune violiniste, q'une malheureuse c\u00e9cit\u00e9 isole du munde, reproduit tr\u00e9s d\u00e9licatement les plus belles compositions des grands ma\u00eetres classiques et modernes\".\nHaving returned to Portugal in 1929, he co-founds the \"Academia de M\u00fasica\" in Coimbra, of which would become the first director, and (in 1934) the \"Instituto de M\u00fasica\", having been active as a teacher and performer in both institutions. Between 1932 and 1936, he performs as a violinist in several Portuguese and Spanish concert halls, sometimes alongside &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Lopes%20Gra%C3%A7a\"&gt;Fernando Lopes Gra\u00e7a&lt;/a&gt;, then a celebrated pianist and later to become an important Portuguese composer. Despite acute ideological differences (Sim\u00f5es Dias was a conservative while Gra\u00e7a was an active communist), the two would remain close friends and exchange correspondence until Sim\u00f5es' death in 1974 \u2013 Gra\u00e7a's \"Sonatina n\u00ba 2\" is dedicated to Sim\u00f5es Dias.\nCareer in musicology and divulgation of classical music.\nHaving become affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Coimbra\"&gt;University of Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; as a lecturer, Sim\u00f5es Dias published his most widespread work, \"A M\u00fasica, essa desconhecida\", in 1951. The collection of essays provides an introduction to the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20music\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"theory%20of%20music\"&gt;theory of music&lt;/a&gt;, and would provide the foundations for his contribution to the divulgation of classical music via radio over the following decades.\nMeanwhile, he pursues more strictly academic work, publishing \"Aspectos da Can\u00e7\u00e3o Popular Portuguesa\" in 1952. The book, a study of Portuguese musical folklore, received the \"Ramalho Ortig\u00e3o National Prize\", granted by the Portuguese \"Secretariat for National Propaganda\", and merited the attention of , leading French musicologist and then director of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Strasbourg\"&gt;Institute of Musicology of the University of Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 over the 1950s, the two would become collaborators in the \"Dictionnaire de la Musique\", to which Sim\u00f5es Dias contributed with his studies of Iberian music.\nFor 13 years (from 1950 to 1963), Sim\u00f5es became more widely known for a series of weekly &lt;a href=\"radio%20shows\"&gt;radio shows&lt;/a&gt; devoted to the divulgation and critique of classical music and music performance, broadcast by the former &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A1dio%20e%20Televis%C3%A3o%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;\"Emissora Nacional\"&lt;/a&gt;, including a series on the life and work of &lt;a href=\"Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, which spanned several years, and a commented selection of musical pieces under the title \"Compositor do M\u00eas\" (\"Composer of the Month\").

There he pursued his dedication to poetry and filled several notebooks with his memoirs, as yet unpublished. Until his death shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Carnation%20Revolution\"&gt;Carnation Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, he maintained a radio show along the molds of his previous project in Portugal \u2013 \"A Arte de ouvir\" (\"The Art of Listening\"), broadcast by local station \"R\u00e1dio Clube de Mo\u00e7ambique\"."
