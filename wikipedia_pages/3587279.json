    "text": "Belarusian cuisine shares many similarities with cuisines of other &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;\nand &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Europe\"&gt;Northeastern European&lt;/a&gt; countries, based predominantly on meat and various vegetables typical for the region.\nHistory.\nBelarus cuisine has predominantly &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; roots. Along with a &lt;a href=\"Ruthenians\"&gt;Ruthenian&lt;/a&gt; influence, it is also linked with &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20cuisine\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polish%20cuisine\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; because of the long intermingling of these three peoples; first within the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; (11th-15th centuries) and later within the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; (16th-17th centuries). Though the Belarusian nobility, like the Polish elite, borrowed much from &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cuisine\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20cuisine\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"French%20cuisine\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; cuisines, this influence hardly made itself felt in the diet of the peasant majority. Still, some of the borrowed dishes spread throughout the society, such as &lt;a href=\"lazanki\"&gt;lazanki&lt;/a&gt; (a mixture of flour &lt;a href=\"dumpling\"&gt;dumpling&lt;/a&gt;s and stewed meat, related to Italian &lt;a href=\"lasagna\"&gt;lasagna&lt;/a&gt;) and, above all, various dishes made of grated &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, typical for German cuisine.\nThe political upheavals of the 20th century completely wiped out the former privileged classes and many traditional upper and middle class dishes went down the path of oblivion. The very idea of a separate Belarusian cuisine was treated with suspicion. Only after World War II did it occur to the communist authorities that the proclaimed \u2018flourishing of national culture\u2019 should also be evident in the cuisine. The only source permitted for such a culinary reconstruction was the heritage of the poorest peasants as of the 1880s, a time when primitive rural lifestyle was already on the wane. Chefs were instructed by the Party to create the new Belarusian cuisine from scratch. Dish names, recipes, \"authentic\" kitchenware \u2013 all were reinvented anew, as though ten centuries of history had never existed. Only the sudden advent of independence in 1991 brought an opportunity to restore these lost traditions, and a great deal still remains to be done here.\nModern Belarusian cuisine is still heavily influenced by its recent Soviet past, and many local restaurants feature Russian or Soviet dishes rather than true specialties of local cuisine. Some Belarusians may have more interest in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20cuisine\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20cuisine\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20cuisine\"&gt;Japanese cuisine&lt;/a&gt; than in their own culinary heritage. However, &lt;a href=\"draniki\"&gt;draniki&lt;/a&gt; (both plain and stuffed), bor\u0161\u010d, cha\u0142adnik, ma\u010danka, zrazy, cold meat rolls, eggs stuffed with mushrooms, &lt;a href=\"halubtsy\"&gt;ha\u0142ubcy&lt;/a&gt;, fried raw pork sausage and &lt;a href=\"bliny\"&gt;bliny&lt;/a&gt; are likely to be found everywhere, as well as sour rye bread.\nMeals.\nA traditional peasant or merchant's dinner consisted of just two dishes: soup and a main course. A special kind of pot, the sparysh, with two compartments, was used by farmers' children to bring lunch to their father working in the fields. Prior to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salad\"&gt;salad&lt;/a&gt;s or other snacks were not very common, and recipes based on Russian models tended to appear in modern Belarusian postwar cookbooks. &lt;a href=\"Quark%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Fresh white cheese&lt;/a&gt; and various kinds of cold meats (usually smoked) were available, however, at least on holidays.\nCereals.\nSince &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; does not grow well in a cold and wet climate, &lt;a href=\"Belarusians\"&gt;Belarusians&lt;/a&gt; were always fond of a kind of somewhat sour &lt;a href=\"rye%20bread\"&gt;rye bread&lt;/a&gt;, and the most traditional hard drink, the local &lt;a href=\"vodka\"&gt;vodka&lt;/a&gt; or \"harelka\" (), was distilled primarily from a rye malt.\nLike other &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20peoples\"&gt;Slavic peoples&lt;/a&gt;, Belarusians could boast of a huge variety of &lt;a href=\"bliny\"&gt;bliny&lt;/a&gt; (pancakes) of various thickness, plain and filled, made mostly of wheat or &lt;a href=\"buckwheat\"&gt;buckwheat&lt;/a&gt; flour, but also using &lt;a href=\"oatmeal\"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; (tsadaviki).\nVarious kinds of &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt; especially &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oatmeal\"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"buckwheat\"&gt;buckwheat&lt;/a&gt; were common. Belarus was the likely centre of Europe's buckwheat culture, and dishes made with this healthy grain used to be very popular: various kinds of &lt;a href=\"bun\"&gt;bun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s and dumplings which, except for the well-known \"&lt;a href=\"kasha\"&gt;kasha&lt;/a&gt;\", no longer exist today.\nVegetables.\nThe main &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s were &lt;a href=\"cabbage\"&gt;cabbage&lt;/a&gt; (often made into &lt;a href=\"sauerkraut\"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"beet\"&gt;beet&lt;/a&gt;s, while &lt;a href=\"turnip\"&gt;turnip&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Rutabaga\"&gt;swedes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parsnip\"&gt;parsnip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s both stewed and boiled (with the addition of a small amount of &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;) were somewhat less popular. As elsewhere in Europe, &lt;a href=\"legume\"&gt;legume&lt;/a&gt;s were the main source of &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, mainly in the form of kamy (puree of &lt;a href=\"pea\"&gt;pea&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"bean\"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s with melted lard).\nSoups.\nThe word &lt;a href=\"soup\"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt; was not known in &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; until the 18th century when the nobility borrowed it from German, but soup as a type of dish clearly existed centuries earlier. The old word for most traditional Belarusian soups was \"\" (), except for those named after the vegetable that was the main ingredient: \"kapusta\" (cabbage soup), \"buraki\" (beet soup), \"gry\u017eanka\" (swede soup). For a typical \"poli\u016dka\" the major ingredients (&lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28food%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s during fasts) were first boiled with &lt;a href=\"spice\"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt;s; cereals such as barley or &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt; were boiled in the stock, and then flour blended with water, bread &lt;a href=\"kvass\"&gt;kvass&lt;/a&gt;, beet juice or &lt;a href=\"buttermilk\"&gt;buttermilk&lt;/a&gt; was added to the stock. Black \"poli\u016dka\", made with &lt;a href=\"goose\"&gt;goose&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt; blood, is closely related to the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20cuisine\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; \"black soup\" \"&lt;a href=\"svartsoppa\"&gt;svartsoppa&lt;/a&gt;\". Offering a matchmaker black \"poli\u016dka\" was the polite way for the bride's parents to decline a young man's proposal. Like the Ukrainians, Russians and &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt;, Belarusians are fond of &lt;a href=\"borscht\"&gt;borscht&lt;/a&gt;, a thick and rich beet and cabbage soup made with grains, potato and meat. Soups are much more authentic, both hot (&lt;a href=\"shchi\"&gt;shchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"borscht\"&gt;bor\u0161\u010d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sorrel\"&gt;sorrel&lt;/a&gt; soup) and especially cold sour soups which provide cooling relief during the hot summer.\nThe Belarusian \"chaladnik\" (), a &lt;a href=\"cold%20borscht\"&gt;cold borscht&lt;/a&gt; made of beets, beet leaves or &lt;a href=\"sorrel\"&gt;sorrel&lt;/a&gt; and served with &lt;a href=\"sour%20cream\"&gt;sour cream&lt;/a&gt;, hard-boiled &lt;a href=\"egg%20%28food%29\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;, and boiled potatoes, has been a popular dish also in &lt;a href=\"Polish%20cuisine\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20cuisine\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt; cuisines since the late 18th century.\nMeat.\nMeat was in rather scarce supply for most people, and was primarily eaten only on the main &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; holidays. Avid consumers of pork, Belarusians are less partial to &lt;a href=\"mutton\"&gt;mutton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;. Most common was raw pork &lt;a href=\"sausage\"&gt;sausage&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a pig intestine stuffed with minced or chopped meat seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Its common name \u2013 \"finger-stuffed sausage\" ( or in short \u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u043e\u045e\u043a\u0430) \u2013 provided a graphic description of the primitive production technology. (), or \"kryvyanka\" (), was a local &lt;a href=\"blood%20sausage\"&gt;blood sausage&lt;/a&gt; () made of &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s blood and buckwheat grain. \u0160kalondza (), or ' (), a particular kind of round sausage made of pig stomach filled with pork minced with spices \u2013 a relative of the Lithuanian &lt;a href=\"skilandis\"&gt;skilandis&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 was known throughout the country. Borrowed from Italian cuisine by nobility in the 16th century, cold meat rolls, &lt;a href=\"salceson\"&gt;salceson&lt;/a&gt;s and balerons were common to all of society by the 19th century, and are still very popular. Smoked goose breast ' (), a local Belarusian and Lithuanian delicacy, was once the pride of middle-class cuisine, but no longer exists today.\n\"\" (), an 18th-century thick meat gravy with pieces of meat and sausage used as a dip or sauce for thick pancakes, is still one of the most popular specialties of Belarusian restaurants today, although it is now generally called \"ma\u010danka\" (, a dip). Also popular are &lt;a href=\"zrazy\"&gt;zrazy&lt;/a&gt;, chopped pieces of beef rolled into a sausage shape and filled with vegetable, mushroom, eggs, potato etc. Pork dishes are usually fried or stewed, garnished with cheese or mushrooms. Beef steaks are also quite frequent, but mutton, once very popular, is almost entirely limited to Caucasian or Central Asian restaurants, although still quite a few eat it today.\nDumplings.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalduny\"&gt;Kalduny&lt;/a&gt;, small boiled dumplings related to &lt;a href=\"Russian%20cuisine\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pelmeni\"&gt;pelmeni&lt;/a&gt; and Italian &lt;a href=\"ravioli\"&gt;ravioli&lt;/a&gt;, were produced in endless combinations of dough, filling and sauce. Especially popular were &lt;a href=\"kalduny\"&gt;kalduny Count Tyshkevich&lt;/a&gt; (filled with a mixture of fried local mushrooms and smoked &lt;a href=\"ham\"&gt;ham&lt;/a&gt;). In the late 19th century kalduny began to be made with grated potato rather than with a flour-based dough and the former huge variety of fillings shrank considerably. Today, kalduny have to struggle vigorously to regain their former popularity, now overtaken by the Russian pelmeni.\nDairy products.\nThe main &lt;a href=\"dairy%20products\"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt; include a kind of &lt;a href=\"Quark%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;fresh white cheese&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"sour%20cream\"&gt;sour cream&lt;/a&gt; (), which is widely used both in cooking and as a garnish. Only in the mid-19th century was fermented &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; () borrowed from the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, and the local version of &lt;a href=\"Edam%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Edam&lt;/a&gt; was very popular for decades in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Sour &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; from the former &lt;a href=\"Wilno%20Voivodeship%20%281923-1939%29\"&gt;Dzisna county&lt;/a&gt; was exported to Britain, where it continued to be the most expensive variety up to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Today, however, these traditions have become a thing of the past.\nBeverages.\nThe traditional hard drink is &lt;a href=\"vodka\"&gt;vodka&lt;/a&gt; or ' (), including varieties made from &lt;a href=\"birch%20sap\"&gt;birch sap&lt;/a&gt; (', ) or flavored with forest &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s (\"&lt;a href=\"zubrovka\"&gt;zubrovka&lt;/a&gt;\", ). &lt;a href=\"Mead\"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt; and similar alcoholic drinks made of &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spice\"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt;s were very common up until the 19th century and then more or less disappeared until the latest revival of the national cuisine. A notable example in this group is \"krambambula\" (), vodka diluted with water, mixed with honey, and flavored with spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, red and black pepper). In the 18th century this drink competed with French champagne in Belarus and only wealthy people could afford it. Today it is enjoying a popular revival, as is evident from the appearance of \"krambambula\" recipes and histories on the Internet.\n&lt;a href=\"Kvass\"&gt;Kvass&lt;/a&gt; traditionally was and still remains the main local non-alcoholic drink, although it is increasingly made with &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;s and artificial flavorings rather than with genuine rye malt and natural flavorings. &lt;a href=\"Kompot\"&gt;Kompot&lt;/a&gt; is also a relatively popular beverage, normally made of dried or fresh fruit, boiled, and then cooled. Every small town boasts a local variety of &lt;a href=\"mineral%20water\"&gt;mineral water&lt;/a&gt;. Belarusians prefer carbonated water.\n\u0422raditional liquid desserts that accompany a meal include \"\" (), a thick liquid made of &lt;a href=\"rye\"&gt;rye&lt;/a&gt; flour and &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; that was popular in the 18th century, and &lt;a href=\"kissel\"&gt;kissel&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional jelly drink of Eastern Europe made from the pulp of forest berries or cooked fruits, originally thickened with oatmeal (now replaced by &lt;a href=\"potato%20starch%20flour\"&gt;potato starch flour&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cornstarch\"&gt;cornstarch&lt;/a&gt;).\nMinority cuisines.\nBelarusian cuisine owes much to &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20cuisine\"&gt;Jewish cooking&lt;/a&gt;. In the 19th century, Jewish influence was especially noticeable in bringing in potato dishes of German origin, such as &lt;a href=\"potato%20babka\"&gt;babka&lt;/a&gt;. This was a two-way gastronomic street, for the famous \"bulbe latkes\", the potato pancakes of the East European Jews, may have been borrowed from the Belarusian &lt;a href=\"draniki\"&gt;draniki&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother important minority ethnic group which influenced Belarusian cuisine were the &lt;a href=\"Lipka%20Tatars\"&gt;Lipka Tatars&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Tatar%20cuisine\"&gt;Tatar cuisine&lt;/a&gt; was especially strong in various cakes with fillings, mutton and vegetable dishes.\nPotatoes.\nThe potato became so common in 19th century \u2013 there are some 300+ dishes recorded in Belarus \u2013 that it came to be considered the core of the national cuisine. In the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, Belarusians were sometimes called \"bulbashi\", a pejorative conjugation of the Belarusian word for potato.\nSalads.\nTypical salads are made of a fairly short list of ingredients: endless combinations of boiled beef or &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20as%20food\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, potato, beet, carrot, &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herring\"&gt;herring&lt;/a&gt;, diced cheese, canned &lt;a href=\"pea\"&gt;pea&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sweetcorn\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt;, canned fish, \u2018crab fingers\u2019, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;s and mushrooms, and are generously seasoned with &lt;a href=\"mayonnaise\"&gt;mayonnaise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sunflower%20oil\"&gt;sunflower oil&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most typical local salads is the \"Belaya Vezha\" salad (named after the &lt;a href=\"Belavezhskaya%20Pushcha\"&gt;Belaya Vezha Forest&lt;/a&gt;), which combines boiled chicken meat with fried &lt;a href=\"Edible%20mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pickled%20cucumber\"&gt;pickled cucumber&lt;/a&gt;s, mixed with mayonnaise and garnished with chopped &lt;a href=\"hard-boiled%20egg\"&gt;hard-boiled egg&lt;/a&gt;. Fresh &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt; salads are also widely available: &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es (also mixed with &lt;a href=\"cucumbers\"&gt;cucumbers&lt;/a&gt;) and onions seasoned with sour cream, &lt;a href=\"radish\"&gt;radish&lt;/a&gt;es with &lt;a href=\"dill\"&gt;dill&lt;/a&gt; and sunflower oil (or sourcream) shredded cabbage salad seasoned with sunflower oil or mayonnaise (similar to coleslaw), &lt;a href=\"Sauerkraut\"&gt;pickled cabbage&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"caraway%20seed\"&gt;caraway seed&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"cranberry\"&gt;cranberries&lt;/a&gt; with onions seasoned with sunflower oil.\nFish.\nHistorically, Belarusians had little access to seafood, and this is still evident in the cuisine. The most common sea fish (after herring, which has been the most common appetizer all along the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; coast and its vicinity ever since the 14th century) are &lt;a href=\"hake\"&gt;hake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; and there are relatively few dishes with such fish. Much more traditional and common are lake fish, notably &lt;a href=\"zander\"&gt;zander&lt;/a&gt;, cooked in endless ways, and &lt;a href=\"carp\"&gt;carp&lt;/a&gt; (especially the famous stuffed carp, the &lt;a href=\"gefilte%20fish\"&gt;gefilte fish&lt;/a&gt; of Jewish cuisine). &lt;a href=\"Eel\"&gt;Eel&lt;/a&gt;s, smoked or stuffed, are the specialty of the lake country in the northwestern part of Belarus, adjacent to &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and Lithuania.\nSide dishes.\n&lt;a href=\"Side%20dishes\"&gt;Side dishes&lt;/a&gt; are usually boiled, fried or &lt;a href=\"mashed%20potatoes\"&gt;mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kasha\"&gt;buckwheat kasha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pasta\"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt;. Meat dishes are frequently served with bliny or draniki stacked in round clay pots."
