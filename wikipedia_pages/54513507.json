Its population was about 9,500 persons in 1841 and 12,500 in 1861. The township was also known as \"North Bierley\", to distinguish it from similarly named places. This is remembered in the name of North Bierley cemetery, opened in 1902 and situated between Low Moor and Buttershaw.\nThe former township has been split up following administrative reorganisation. The modern housing estate of Bierley, Bierley Hall Wood, and the hamlets of Bierley Lane and Hilltop now belong to Tong ward. Low Moor and Carr Lane are part of Wyke ward, while Wibsey, Slack and Folly Hall are in &lt;a href=\"Wibsey\"&gt;Wibsey&lt;/a&gt; ward."
