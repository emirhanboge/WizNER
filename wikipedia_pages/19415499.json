    "text": "The Party of Slovenian People (\"Stranka slovenskega naroda, SSN\") is an extra-parliamentary party in &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Slovenian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2008 legislative election in Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, the party won 0.25% of the popular vote and no seats in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28Slovenia%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Slovenian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;early election on 4 December 2011&lt;/a&gt;, the party won 0.09% of the vote, thus not gaining any seats in the National Assembly. The party won 0.4% of the vote in the European Parliament election on 25 May 2014, failing to gain any seats.\nThe party has its roots in the &lt;a href=\"Far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt; Slovenian National Right party, which was transformed and renamed after its failure in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Slovenian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1996 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;. In later years, it was associated with the nationalistic organization Hervardi. The party's candidate for the 2008 legislative election was Andrej \u0160i\u0161ko, formerly a prominent member of the &lt;a href=\"ultras\"&gt;ultras&lt;/a&gt; group \"Viole Maribor\". \u0160i\u0161ko was apprehended during a pre-election debate appearance due to an outstanding arrest warrant after failing to appear in prison to begin serving a prison sentence for a 1992 murder attempt."
