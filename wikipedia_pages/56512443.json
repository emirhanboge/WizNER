    "text": "Eug\u00e8ne Huat (8 February 1907 \u2013 15 December 1980) was a &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; who was champion of France and Europe at &lt;a href=\"flyweight\"&gt;flyweight&lt;/a&gt;, and fought four times for world titles at &lt;a href=\"bantamweight\"&gt;bantamweight&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nAfter making his professional debut in 1926, Huat had some notable wins in his first three years as a pro, beating &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Huguenin\"&gt;Maurice Huguenin&lt;/a&gt; in January 1927 and November 1928, &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Chalange\"&gt;Rene Chalange&lt;/a&gt; in April 1927 and February 1929, &lt;a href=\"Praxille%20Gyd%C3%A9\"&gt;Praxille Gyd\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in November 1927, &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Oliva\"&gt;Kid Oliva&lt;/a&gt; in December 1928, and &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Jarvis\"&gt;Ernie Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; in January 1929.\nIn June 1929 he beat &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Pladner\"&gt;\u00c9mile Pladner&lt;/a&gt; on points at the &lt;a href=\"Cirque%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Cirque de Paris&lt;/a&gt; to win the French and European flyweight titles. Towards the end of the year he travelled to the United States to take part in a tournament to content the vacant &lt;a href=\"NYSAC\"&gt;NYSAC&lt;/a&gt; world flyweight title; Huat beat &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Izzy%20Schwartz\"&gt;Corporal Izzy Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, before losing to &lt;a href=\"Eladio%20Vald%C3%A9s\"&gt;Eladio \"Black Bill\" Vald\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final.\nWhile in the US, Huat moved up to bantamweight, losing his first fight at the weight to &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Bell%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Archie Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Huat beat &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Petit-Biquet\"&gt;Nicolas Petit-Biquet&lt;/a&gt; in April 1930, and Pladner in May, and in October faced &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Al%20Brown\"&gt;Panama Al Brown&lt;/a&gt; in Paris for the &lt;a href=\"International%20Boxing%20Union%20%281913%E2%80%931946%29\"&gt;IBU&lt;/a&gt; world bantamweight title, losing on points. In July 1931, Huat challenged for &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Sanstol\"&gt;Pete Sanstol&lt;/a&gt;'s Canadian Boxing Federation &amp; Montreal Athletic Commission-recognised world bantamweight title in Montreal, again losing on points. While still in Montreal, he lost to &lt;a href=\"Newsboy%20Brown\"&gt;Newsboy Brown&lt;/a&gt; in September 1931, but won a return fight a month later. Three weeks after the second fight, Huat challenged Brown again, with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;National Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; world title at stake. Huat again lost on points.\nBack in France, Huon put together six straight wins, including victories over &lt;a href=\"Francois%20Biron\"&gt;Francois Biron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Popescu\"&gt;Lucian Popescu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Len%20Beynon\"&gt;Len Beynon&lt;/a&gt;, before losses to &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Francis\"&gt;Kid Francis&lt;/a&gt; and Panama Al Brown. Later in 1932, Huat travelled again to North America for a largely unsuccessful series of fights.\nHuat won the French bantamweight title in August 1933 with a points win over &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Lorenzoni\"&gt;Eugene Lorenzoni&lt;/a&gt;, losing it in his first defence to &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Decico\"&gt;Joseph Decico&lt;/a&gt; in March 1934, also losing a rematch three months later. \nDespite poor results in the preceding two years, Huat got a fourth world title shot in August 1934 when he challenged for &lt;a href=\"Sixto%20Escobar\"&gt;Sixto Escobar&lt;/a&gt;'s Montreal Athletic Commission title in Montreal. Escobar took a unanimous points verdict. \nIn January 1935 Huat challenged Pladner for the French title, Pladner stopping him in the seventh round. Over the next three years, Huat continued to fight quality opponents, with wins over &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Maton\"&gt;Gaston Maton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Young%20Perez\"&gt;Young Perez&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bataille%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Georges Bataille&lt;/a&gt;, but also suffered losses to Perez, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Kane\"&gt;Peter Kane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pancho\"&gt;Little Pancho&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuat was out of the ring for almost three years from June 1938 before making a return in May 1941. He continued to fight until 1942, his penultimate fight a defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20Angelmann\"&gt;Valentin Angelmann&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe finished with a record of 80 wins, 44 defeats, and 9 draws.\nAfter retiring from the ring, Huat went into management, working with boxers such as &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Montane\"&gt;Pierre Montane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Toniolo\"&gt;Tony Toniolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Langlois%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Pierre Langlois&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Jouas\"&gt;Jean Jouas&lt;/a&gt;."
