    "text": "Goole is a &lt;a href=\"port%20town\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; town and &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;East Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. The town was &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historically&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. Goole lies on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;River Ouse&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; and west of &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011\"&gt;2011 UK census&lt;/a&gt;, Goole parish had a population of 19,518, an increase on the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001\"&gt;2001 UK census&lt;/a&gt; figure of 17,600.\nThe port, which is the UK's furthest &lt;a href=\"inland%20port\"&gt;inland port&lt;/a&gt;, is highly versatile and capable of handling nearly 2 million tonnes of cargo per annum, making it one of the most important ports on the east coast of England.\nGoole is &lt;a href=\"twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Z%C5%82ot%C3%B3w\"&gt;Z\u0142ot\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; in Poland. Goole was informally twinned with &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s; at that time, Gibraltar Court was named in Goole and Goole Court was named in Gibraltar.\nEtymology.\nUnusually for an English place-name 'Goole' has its origins in &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt;. It derives from the word \"goule\", meaning 'stream' or 'channel', or possibly 'outlet drain'. Not recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt;\", its first mention was in 1362 as \"Gulle\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Dutch civil engineer &lt;a href=\"Cornelius%20Vermuyden\"&gt;Cornelius Vermuyden&lt;/a&gt; diverted the &lt;a href=\"River%20Don%2C%20South%20Yorkshire\"&gt;River Don&lt;/a&gt; northwards to the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;River Ouse&lt;/a&gt; in 1626\u20131629 in order to drain the marshland of &lt;a href=\"Hatfield%20Chase\"&gt;Hatfield Chase&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;King Charles I&lt;/a&gt;. It made the new lower Don \u2013 known as the Dutch River \u2013 navigable for &lt;a href=\"barge\"&gt;barge&lt;/a&gt;s so that &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"South%20Yorkshire%20Coalfield\"&gt;South Yorkshire Coalfield&lt;/a&gt; could be transported to the new confluence for transfer to seagoing vessels. There the engineers built a new wooden bridge \u2013 rebuilt in iron in the 1890s and now known as the Dutch River Bridge \u2013 to the east of which a new village called 'Goole' formed.\nDevelopment.\nIn the 1820s the &lt;a href=\"Aire%20and%20Calder%20Navigation\"&gt;Aire and Calder Navigation&lt;/a&gt; company proposed development of a new canal to transport coal from the existing broad canal from &lt;a href=\"Knottingley\"&gt;Knottingley&lt;/a&gt; in the northern sector of the coalfield in 1826. Once it reached Goole the company proposed development of a new &lt;a href=\"floating%20dock%20%28impounded%29\"&gt;floating dock&lt;/a&gt; capable of handling larger sea-going vessels. Chief engineer Thomas Hamond Bartholomew was instructed to build the canal, docks and an associated company town to house both the dock workers and visiting seamen. Bartholomew commissioned civil engineer and builder &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Banks%20%28builder%29\"&gt;Sir Edward Banks&lt;/a&gt; company to construct part of the canal and the eight &lt;a href=\"transshipment\"&gt;transshipment&lt;/a&gt; docks and to lay out the associated new town to the west of the existing wooden bridge. The Banks Arms Hotel on Aire Street \u2013 today known as the Lowther Hotel - was in 1824 the first building constructed in what was known as New Goole; \"The Macintosh Arms\" &lt;a href=\"public%20house\"&gt;public house&lt;/a&gt; on the same street took its name from engineer &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20McIntosh%20%28civil%20engineer%29\"&gt;Hugh Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Goole opened as a port on 20 July 1826 it was a new community of about 450 people. Now it is a town with about 18,000 inhabitants.\nDocks.\nThree locks keep the water in of floating docks at a constant depth of by preventing the level from rising and falling with the tides in the River Ouse. Once ships are within the complex, eight docks provide a total quayside of . Beside the docks are transit sheds where cargo is stored, many of them equipped with overhead cranes. Unlike many ports every one of the eight docks has been in full commercial operation since its construction in the period from 1826 to 1912.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Hamond%20Bartholomew\"&gt;William Hamond Bartholomew&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father T. H. Bartholomew in 1853 and in 1863 introduced the &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Pudding\"&gt;Tom Pudding&lt;/a&gt; system of compartment boats, which could carry around of coal. On reaching the docks the barges were lifted by large hoists, from which they could be discharged direct into seagoing ships, a system so successful that it competed against rail until 1985.\nFor most of its life the port was most associated with the shipment of coal and associated cargoes, including the importation of &lt;a href=\"pit%20prop\"&gt;pit prop&lt;/a&gt;s. With the demise of mining the former Timber Pond became a marina, trading under the name Goole Boathouse. It has berths for 150 boats.\nAfter a period of decline commodities were replaced by containers, the export of &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; and the import of timber from north-eastern Europe. Today the Port of Goole has regular &lt;a href=\"cargo%20liner\"&gt;cargo liner&lt;/a&gt; services to Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco and South Africa and a transshipment route to &lt;a href=\"Europoort\"&gt;Europort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresent.\nGlass is produced in Goole, which is also the centre of an agricultural district. The town's former large employer was a clothing manufacture for the big multiples but it closed in the late 2000s.\nGoole has a modestly sized town centre with many high street shops, independent retailers and &lt;a href=\"public%20house\"&gt;public house&lt;/a&gt;s. The main shopping area is Wesley Square, off Boothferry Road (which has been pedestrianised around the main shopping area). There is a modern retail development in the town centre, a leisure centre next to the &lt;a href=\"Dock%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Goole%20and%20District%20Hospital\"&gt;Goole and District Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, to the north of the town. A theatre and cinema, 'Junction', opened in 2009.\nGoole has several &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Goole%20High%20School\"&gt;High School&lt;/a&gt; with a sixth-form college attached to it. Goole College is affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Hull%20College\"&gt;Hull College&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=\"Further%20Education\"&gt;Further Education&lt;/a&gt; colleges in &lt;a href=\"Selby\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scunthorpe\"&gt;Scunthorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Burton\"&gt;Bishop Burton&lt;/a&gt;. Goole College runs a scheme for showing the older students at the High School (in year 10 and above) what opportunities the college offers them.\nTransport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway\"&gt;Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway&lt;/a&gt; built a line from &lt;a href=\"Pontefract\"&gt;Pontefract&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wakefield\"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; in 1848 and the North Eastern Railway connected the port with &lt;a href=\"Doncaster\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt; in 1870. The prosperity from the coal and general cargo trade with the &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding&lt;/a&gt; industrial area continued for 150 years after the opening of the canal.\nToday &lt;a href=\"Goole%20railway%20station\"&gt;Goole railway station&lt;/a&gt; is at the junction of the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20and%20Doncaster%20Branch\"&gt;Hull and Doncaster Branch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pontefract%20Line\"&gt;Pontefract Line&lt;/a&gt;. Service is provided to &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Paragon%20Interchange\"&gt;Hull Paragon Interchange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20railway%20station\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20railway%20station\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20railway%20station\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and the commuter stations in between.\nGoole is south of the &lt;a href=\"M62%20motorway\"&gt;M62&lt;/a&gt; linking it with Kingston upon Hull in the east and &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; urban belt in the west. To the north the &lt;a href=\"A63%20road\"&gt;A63 road&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Howden\"&gt;Howden&lt;/a&gt; provides local access to the &lt;a href=\"A19%20road\"&gt;A19 road&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Selby\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"M18%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;M18&lt;/a&gt; runs west of the town, connecting it with &lt;a href=\"South%20Yorkshire\"&gt;South Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"South%20of%20England\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"English%20Midlands\"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt;. Bus services to surrounding towns and villages are provided by &lt;a href=\"East%20Yorkshire%20Motor%20Services\"&gt;East Yorkshire Motor Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20in%20Hull\"&gt;Stagecoach in Hull&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arriva%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Arriva Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernance.\nBefore the reform of local government in 1974, brought about by the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201972\"&gt;Local Government Act 1972&lt;/a&gt;, Goole was in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. It was then placed in the &lt;a href=\"Boothferry%20%28district%29\"&gt;Boothferry&lt;/a&gt; district of the county of &lt;a href=\"Humberside\"&gt;Humberside&lt;/a&gt; until that was abolished in 1996. Since 1996 Goole has been in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;East Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. It is represented by four councillors on the &lt;a href=\"East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire%20Council\"&gt;East Riding of Yorkshire Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoole is in the parliamentary constituency of &lt;a href=\"Brigg%20and%20Goole%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Brigg and Goole&lt;/a&gt;, which has been represented in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Percy\"&gt;Andrew Percy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmarks.\nGoole's most prominent landmarks are its twin &lt;a href=\"water%20tower\"&gt;water tower&lt;/a&gt;s, nicknamed 'salt' and 'pepper'. The new white water-tower was the largest in Europe at the time of construction. In the winter months Goole's &lt;a href=\"gas%20holder\"&gt;gas holder&lt;/a&gt; on Anderson Road is visible across the north of the town. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Hoist%20%28device%29\"&gt;hoists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crane%20%28machine%29\"&gt;cranes&lt;/a&gt; on the dockside can be seen across the town. The &lt;a href=\"Steeple%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;steeple&lt;/a&gt; of Goole Parish Church is tall enough to be seen across the town. The townscape is made up mostly of utility and industrial structures. There is a clock tower in the main shopping district of the town on a roundabout on the site of the former open-air marketplace. &lt;a href=\"West%20Park%2C%20Goole\"&gt;West Park&lt;/a&gt; is an Edwardian park in the town.\nPlans.\nGoole's industrial park, Capitol Park / Goole36, has attracted two large employers: &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Industries\"&gt;Guardian Industries&lt;/a&gt;, which built a glass-manufacturing plant, and &lt;a href=\"Tesco\"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;, which built a distribution centre. The arrival of these employers resulted in the creation of hundreds of new jobs. A new &lt;a href=\"Morrisons\"&gt;Morrisons&lt;/a&gt; store opened in Goole on 2 August 2010, on land previously occupied by Timms Mill on Boothferry Road. A new railway &lt;a href=\"Siemens%20Goole\"&gt;rolling stock&lt;/a&gt; factory was built at the same location during 2018/2019. The plant, owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Siemens\"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt;, builds the new tube trains for the &lt;a href=\"Piccadilly%20line\"&gt;Piccadilly line&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.\nSport.\nGoole Town Cricket Club supports local cricket teams. Of its three teams, the first team plays in the club cricket York &amp; District Senior League. A new clubhouse was constructed in 1996 providing facilities and a bar.\nRugby Union is played close to the cricket club at Westfield Banks, sharing facilities with Goole Tennis Club and Goole Viking Striders running club. Goole RUFC currently fields two teams, the first team playing in Yorkshire Division Two.\nGoole Tennis Centre is a nine-court tennis club on the Westfield Banks site.\nGoole has two &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; teams - &lt;a href=\"Goole%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Goole A.F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and Goole United A.F.C. They currently play in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One%20South\"&gt;Northern Premier League Division One South&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Humber%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Humber Premier League Division One&lt;/a&gt; respectively. They both play at the Victoria Pleasure Grounds on Marcus Street. The nearest professional teams are &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Grimsby Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barnsley%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scunthorpe%20United\"&gt;Scunthorpe United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoole used to have two golf clubs. The early course, founded in 1900, was at Rawcliffe Park. The later course was at Airmyn Park from 1911 to the Second World War. Currently Goole's nearest golf clubs are the Boothferry Golf Club in &lt;a href=\"Spaldington\"&gt;Spaldington&lt;/a&gt; and Drax Golf Club in &lt;a href=\"Drax%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Drax&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\nRadio Medica is a &lt;a href=\"hospital%20radio\"&gt;not-for-profit radio station&lt;/a&gt; broadcast from the Goole And District Hospital.\nThe town is served by a weekly &lt;a href=\"tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29\"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"Goole%20Times\"&gt;The Goole Times&lt;/a&gt;\", published since 1853 and sold in Goole and neighbouring parts of the East Riding of Yorkshire."
