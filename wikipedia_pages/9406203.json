    "text": "The Lotus 109 was a &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; car used by &lt;a href=\"Team%20Lotus\"&gt;Team Lotus&lt;/a&gt; in the latter part of the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Formula%20One%20season\"&gt;1994 Formula One season&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Murphy%20%28car%20designer%29\"&gt;Chris Murphy&lt;/a&gt; who based the car on his &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20107\"&gt;Lotus 107&lt;/a&gt; model. The car featured sculptured sidepods, a shorter wheelbase, and a lower centre of gravity than its predecessor, whilst Mugen developed the engine to be lighter and higher-revving than the previous spec engine issued to the team. It was powered by a &lt;a href=\"Mugen-Honda\"&gt;Mugen-Honda&lt;/a&gt; V10. &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Herbert\"&gt;Johnny Herbert&lt;/a&gt; was able to keep Lotus competitive in &lt;a href=\"1994%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1994%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Monza&lt;/a&gt; with the car, but the funds were drying up and development was limited. At the end of the season, the car was retired and Team Lotus went into &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;receivership&lt;/a&gt;."
