    "text": "Sir James O'Grady, (6 May 1866 \u2013 10 December 1934) was a trade unionist and &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; politician in the United Kingdom. He was the first colonial governor appointed by the Labour Party from within its own ranks.\nEarly life.\nO'Grady was born in &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; to Irish parents. His father was a labourer, and after leaving school at ten, O'Grady did various lowly jobs, before training as a &lt;a href=\"cabinet-maker\"&gt;cabinet-maker&lt;/a&gt;, and became active in the &lt;a href=\"Amalgamated%20Union%20of%20Cabinetmakers\"&gt;Amalgamated Union of Cabinetmakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical career.\nA member of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Independent Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and supported by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Labour%20Party%23Labour%20Representation%20Committee%20%281900%E2%80%931906%29\"&gt;Labour Representation Committee&lt;/a&gt;, he was elected at the &lt;a href=\"1906%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1906 general election&lt;/a&gt; as Member of Parliament (MP) for &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Leeds East&lt;/a&gt;. He had benefited from the &lt;a href=\"Gladstone%E2%80%93MacDonald%20pact\"&gt;Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact&lt;/a&gt; negotiated between &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Gladstone%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Gladstone\"&gt;Herbert Gladstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramsay%20MacDonald\"&gt;Ramsay MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;, and faced only a Unionist opponent, whom he defeated by a wide margin.\nO'Grady was re-elected at the elections in &lt;a href=\"January%201910%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;January 1910&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"December%201910%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;December 1910 elections&lt;/a&gt;, and when the Leeds East constituency was abolished for the &lt;a href=\"1918%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1918 general election&lt;/a&gt;, he was returned unopposed for the new &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20South%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Leeds South East&lt;/a&gt; constituency. He held that seat until he stepped down from &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1924%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1924 general election&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"British%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke frequently, particularly on &lt;a href=\"foreign%20affairs\"&gt;foreign affairs&lt;/a&gt;, and was noted as a strong supporter of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, speaking at recruitment rallies. He was also Labour's only &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; MP.\nThrough his role in the Amalgamated Union of Cabinet Makers, he had been &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Trades%20Union%20Congress\"&gt;President of the Trades Union Congress&lt;/a&gt; in 1898, and he continued his union activities whilst an MP. After a variety of posts in unions related to the furniture trades, he became general secretary of the National Federation of General Workers in 1918.\nGovernorships.\nIn 1924, &lt;a href=\"Ramsay%20MacDonald\"&gt;Ramsay MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"First%20Labour%20Government%20%28UK%29\"&gt;First Labour Government&lt;/a&gt; offered O'Grady the post of British Ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and he accepted. He was a logical choice because he had successfully negotiated an exchange of prisoners in 1919 and had been involved in international trade union-led efforts to relieve the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20famine%20of%201921\"&gt;Russian famine in 1921&lt;/a&gt;, but O'Grady did not in the end get the job, because the government postponed exchanging ambassadors.\nInstead O'Grady became &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Tasmania\"&gt;Governor of Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; from 1924 to 1930. The first Labour politician to be appointed as a colonial governor by a Labour government, his appointment was resisted by the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, which wanted the job to go to an Australian.\nO'Grady was knighted as a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George\"&gt;Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George&lt;/a&gt; and moved to &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, taking office on 23 December. His governorship was marked by conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Tasmanian%20Legislative%20Council\"&gt;Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt; (which urged to do more to promote economic development), and his governors reports were outspoken, but he appears to have parted on good terms.\nO'Grady's next appointment was in 1931, as &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands\"&gt;Governor of the Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;, but he retired in 1934 due to ill-health. He died later that year, aged 68."
