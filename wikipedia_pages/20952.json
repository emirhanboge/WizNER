    "text": "Mobile ( , ) is the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile County, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population within the city limits was 195,111 as of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, making it the third-most-populous city in Alabama, and the most populous in Mobile County.\nAlabama's only saltwater port, Mobile is located on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20River\"&gt;Mobile River&lt;/a&gt; at the head of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the north-central Gulf Coast. The &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Mobile\"&gt;Port of Mobile&lt;/a&gt; has always played a key role in the economic health of the city, beginning with the settlement as an important trading center between the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;French colonists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;, down to its current role as the 12th-largest port in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobile is the principal municipality of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Mobile metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;. This region of 412,992 residents is composed solely of Mobile County; it is the third-largest metropolitan statistical area in the state. Mobile is the largest city in the Mobile\u2013&lt;a href=\"Daphne%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Daphne&lt;/a&gt;\u2212&lt;a href=\"Fairhope%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Fairhope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;CSA&lt;/a&gt;, with a total population of 604,726, the second largest in the state. , the population within a radius of Mobile is 1,262,907.\nMobile was founded in 1702 by the &lt;a href=\"Early%20modern%20France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; as the first capital of &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. During its first 100 years, Mobile was a colony of &lt;a href=\"Early%20Modern%20France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile became a part of the United States in 1813, with the annexation by President &lt;a href=\"James%20Madison\"&gt;James Madison&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"West%20Florida\"&gt;West Florida&lt;/a&gt; from Spain. The city surrendered to Federal forces on April 12, 1865, after &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; victories at two forts protecting the city. This, along with the news of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20E.%20Johnston\"&gt;Johnston&lt;/a&gt;'s surrender negotiations with &lt;a href=\"William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman\"&gt;Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, led &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Taylor%20%28Confederate%20general%29\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to seek a meeting with his Union counterpart, Maj. Gen. &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Canby\"&gt;Edward R. S. Canby&lt;/a&gt;. The two generals met several miles north of Mobile on May 2. After agreeing to a 48-hour &lt;a href=\"Ceasefire\"&gt;truce&lt;/a&gt;, the generals enjoyed an &lt;a href=\"Al%20fresco%20dining\"&gt;al fresco luncheon&lt;/a&gt; of food, drink, and lively music. Canby offered Taylor the same terms agreed upon between &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulysses%20S.%20Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor accepted the terms and surrendered his command on May 4 at &lt;a href=\"Citronelle%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Citronelle, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsidered one of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;'s cultural centers, Mobile has several art museums, a symphony orchestra, professional opera, professional ballet company, and a large concentration of historic architecture. Mobile is known for having the oldest organized &lt;a href=\"Carnival\"&gt;Carnival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mardi%20Gras\"&gt;Mardi Gras&lt;/a&gt; celebrations in the United States. Its French Catholic colonial settlers celebrated this festival from the first decade of the 18th century. Beginning in 1830, Mobile was host to the first formally organized Carnival &lt;a href=\"mystic%20society\"&gt;mystic society&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate with a parade in the United States. (In New Orleans, such a group is called a \"krewe\".)\nEtymology.\nThe city gained its name from the Mobile tribe that the French colonists encountered living in the area of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Although debated by Alabama historians, they may have been descendants of the Native American tribe whose small fortress town, &lt;a href=\"Mabila\"&gt;Mabila&lt;/a&gt;, was used to conceal several thousand native warriors before an attack in 1540 on the expedition of Spanish explorer &lt;a href=\"Hernando%20de%20Soto\"&gt;Hernando de Soto&lt;/a&gt;. About seven years after the founding of the French Mobile settlement, the Mobile tribe, along with the Tohom\u00e9, gained permission from the colonists to settle near the fort.\nHistory.\nColonial.\nThe European settlement of Mobile began with French colonists, who in 1702 constructed \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Mobile%20Site\"&gt;Fort Louis de la Louisiane&lt;/a&gt;\", at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20River\"&gt;Mobile River&lt;/a&gt;, as the first capital of the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empires\"&gt;French colony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29\"&gt;La Louisiane&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded by &lt;a href=\"French%20Canadian\"&gt;French Canadian&lt;/a&gt; brothers &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Le%20Moyne%20d%27Iberville\"&gt;Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Le%20Moyne%2C%20Sieur%20de%20Bienville\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville&lt;/a&gt;, to establish control over France's claims to \"La Louisiane\". Bienville was appointed as royal governor of French Louisiana in 1701. Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20, 1703, by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20de%20la%20Croix%20de%20Chevri%C3%A8res%20de%20Saint-Vallier\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevri\u00e8res de Saint-Vallier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Quebec\"&gt;Bishop of Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. The parish was the first French Catholic parish established on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Gulf Coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1704 the &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20P%C3%A9lican%20%281702%29\"&gt;ship \"P\u00e9lican\"&lt;/a&gt; delivered 23 Frenchwomen to the colony; passengers had contracted &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; at a stop in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. Though most of the \"\"P\u00e9lican\" girls\" recovered, numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans contracted the disease in turn and many died. This early period was also the occasion of the importation of the first African &lt;a href=\"slaves\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, transported aboard a French supply ship from the French colony of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, where they had first been held. The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708, yet shrinking to 178 persons two years later due to disease.\nThese additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods resulted in Bienville ordering that the settlement be relocated in 1711 several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20River\"&gt;Mobile River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt;. A new earth-and-palisade Fort Louis was constructed at the new site during this time. By 1712, when &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20Crozat\"&gt;Antoine Crozat&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to take over administration of the colony, its population had reached 400 persons.\nThe capital of &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29\"&gt;La Louisiane&lt;/a&gt; was moved in 1720 to &lt;a href=\"Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Biloxi&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Mobile to serve as a regional military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Cond\u00e9 in honor of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Henri%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon\"&gt;Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1763, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; was signed, ending the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, which Britain won, defeating France. By this treaty, France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain. This area was made a part of the expanded British &lt;a href=\"West%20Florida\"&gt;West Florida&lt;/a&gt; colony. The British changed the name of Fort Cond\u00e9 to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Charlotte%2C%20Mobile\"&gt;Fort Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Charlotte\"&gt;Queen Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 as a result of the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the &lt;a href=\"Code%20Noir\"&gt;Code Noir&lt;/a&gt;, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for &lt;a href=\"Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; fleeing the other colonies.\nWhile the British were dealing with their rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast, the &lt;a href=\"Spain%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;Spanish entered the war&lt;/a&gt; in 1779 as an ally of France. They took the opportunity to order &lt;a href=\"Bernardo%20de%20G%C3%A1lvez%20y%20Madrid%2C%20Count%20of%20G%C3%A1lvez\"&gt;Bernardo de Galvez&lt;/a&gt;, Governor of Louisiana, on an expedition east to retake West Florida. He captured Mobile during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fort%20Charlotte\"&gt;Battle of Fort Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; in 1780, as part of this campaign. The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony west of the Mississippi River, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies, partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress. Due to strong trade ties, many residents of Mobile and &lt;a href=\"West%20Florida\"&gt;West Florida&lt;/a&gt; remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Crown\"&gt;British Crown&lt;/a&gt;. The Spanish renamed the fort as Fortaleza Carlota, and held Mobile as a part of Spanish &lt;a href=\"West%20Florida\"&gt;West Florida&lt;/a&gt; until 1813, when it was seized by United States General &lt;a href=\"James%20Wilkinson\"&gt;James Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century.\nBy the time Mobile was included in the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Territory\"&gt;Mississippi Territory&lt;/a&gt; in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people. The city was included in the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Territory\"&gt;Alabama Territory&lt;/a&gt; in 1817, after &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819; Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time.\nMobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. River transportation was aided by the introduction of &lt;a href=\"steamboat\"&gt;steamboat&lt;/a&gt;s in the early decades of the 19th century. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in Great Britain created shortages of cotton, driving up prices on world markets. Much land well suited to growing cotton lies in the vicinity of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20River\"&gt;Mobile River&lt;/a&gt;, and its main tributaries the &lt;a href=\"Tombigbee%20River\"&gt;Tombigbee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20River\"&gt;Alabama River&lt;/a&gt;s. A &lt;a href=\"plantation%20economy\"&gt;plantation economy&lt;/a&gt; using slave labor developed in the region and as a consequence Mobile's population quickly grew. It came to be settled by attorneys, &lt;a href=\"cotton%20factor\"&gt;cotton factor&lt;/a&gt;s, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas.\nFrom the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the &lt;a href=\"coastwise%20slave%20trade\"&gt;coastwise slave trade&lt;/a&gt; from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade \u2013 people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, which was deeply involved in the cotton industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe prosperity stimulated a building boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, with the building of some of the most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the &lt;a href=\"Panic%20of%201837\"&gt;Panic of 1837&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Black Belt&lt;/a&gt;; by 1840 Mobile was second only to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; in cotton exports in the nation.\nWith the economy so focused on one crop, Mobile's fortunes were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland &lt;a href=\"Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South\"&gt;plantation&lt;/a&gt; areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship &lt;a href=\"Clotilda%20%28slave%20ship%29\"&gt;\"Clotilda\"&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Cudjoe%20Lewis\"&gt;Cudjoe Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, who in the 1920s became the last survivor of the slave trade.\nBy 1853, fifty Jewish families lived in Mobile, including &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Phillips%20%28lawyer%29\"&gt;Philip Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney from &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, who was elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress. Many early Jewish families were descendants of Sephardic Jews who had been among the earliest colonial settlers in Charleston and Savannah.\nBy 1860 Mobile's population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people; it was the 27th-largest city in the United States and 4th-largest in what would soon be the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate States of America&lt;/a&gt;. The free population in the whole of Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 citizens, of which 1,195 were &lt;a href=\"Person%20of%20color\"&gt;free people of color&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, 1,785 slave owners in the county held 11,376 people in bondage, about one-quarter of the total county population of 41,130 people.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Mobile was a Confederate city. The \"&lt;a href=\"H.%20L.%20Hunley%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;H. L. Hunley&lt;/a&gt;\", the first &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; to sink an enemy ship, was built in Mobile. One of the most famous &lt;a href=\"naval%20engagement\"&gt;naval engagement&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; taking control of &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Bay\"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Robert E. Lee&lt;/a&gt;'s surrender at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Courthouse\"&gt;Appomattox Courthouse&lt;/a&gt;, the city surrendered to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20army\"&gt;Union army&lt;/a&gt; to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Spanish%20Fort\"&gt;Spanish Fort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fort%20Blakely\"&gt;Fort Blakely&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 25, 1865, the city suffered great loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20magazine%20explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ammunition%20depot\"&gt;ammunition depot&lt;/a&gt; on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a deep hole at the depot's location, and sank ships docked on the Mobile River; the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.\nFederal &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; in Mobile began after the Civil War and effectively ended in 1874 when the local &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; gained control of the city government. The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3\u00a0million in 1882.\n20th century.\nThe turn of the 20th century brought the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Era\"&gt;Progressive Era&lt;/a&gt; to Mobile. The economic structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting a significant increase in population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.\nDuring this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that &lt;a href=\"Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites&lt;/a&gt;; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first &lt;a href=\"racial%20segregation\"&gt;racial segregation&lt;/a&gt; ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's \"de facto\" segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow laws&lt;/a&gt; to maintain &lt;a href=\"white%20supremacy\"&gt;supremacy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1911 the city adopted a commission form of government, which had three members elected by &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; voting. Considered to be progressive, as it would reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile was one of the last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored &lt;a href=\"single-member%20districts\"&gt;single-member districts&lt;/a&gt; in order to elect candidates of their choice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"red%20imported%20fire%20ant\"&gt;red imported fire ant&lt;/a&gt; was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America. The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships. They have spread throughout the South and Southwest.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the defense buildup in Mobile shipyards resulted in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at the &lt;a href=\"Brookley%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Brookley Army Air Field&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.\nMobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20ships\"&gt;Liberty ships&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Drydock%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt; (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20powers%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Axis powers&lt;/a&gt; could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of &lt;a href=\"T2%20tanker\"&gt;T2 tanker&lt;/a&gt;s for the War Department. &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation\"&gt;Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"Waterman%20Steamship%20Corporation\"&gt;Waterman Steamship Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, focused on building &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20ship\"&gt;freighters&lt;/a&gt;, s, and &lt;a href=\"Minesweeper%20%28ship%29\"&gt;minesweepers&lt;/a&gt;. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.\nA &lt;a href=\"race%20riot\"&gt;race riot&lt;/a&gt; broke out in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO management had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Guard%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.\nIn the late 1940s, the transition to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow\"&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt; South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Hill%20College\"&gt;Spring Hill College&lt;/a&gt; accepted students of all races. Unlike in the rest of the state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.\nThe Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949, allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. &lt;a href=\"George%20E.%20McNally\"&gt;George E. McNally&lt;/a&gt;, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.\nIn 1963, three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to &lt;a href=\"Murphy%20High%20School%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Murphy High School&lt;/a&gt;. This was nearly a decade after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.\nThe &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt; gained congressional passage of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964\"&gt;Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965\"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965&lt;/a&gt;, eventually ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state had more than one way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.\nIn 1969 &lt;a href=\"Brookley%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Brookley Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; was closed by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing resulted in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.\nMobile's city commission form of government was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in \"&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Mobile%20v.%20Bolden\"&gt;City of Mobile v. Bolden&lt;/a&gt;\", which was remanded by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission form of government in 1911 and &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the three members of the city commission should be elected from &lt;a href=\"single-member%20districts\"&gt;single-member districts&lt;/a&gt;, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a &lt;a href=\"mayor-council\"&gt;mayor-council&lt;/a&gt; form of government, with seven members elected from &lt;a href=\"single-member%20districts\"&gt;single-member districts&lt;/a&gt;. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.\nBeginning in the late 1980s, newly elected mayor &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dow\"&gt;Mike Dow&lt;/a&gt; and the city council began an effort termed the \"String of Pearls Initiative\" to make Mobile into a competitive city. The city initiated construction of numerous new facilities and projects, and the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes. City and county leaders also made efforts to attract new business ventures to the area.\nGeography and climate.\nGeography.\nMobile is located in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Alabama. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with of it being land, and , or 26.1% of the total, being covered by water. The elevation in Mobile ranges from on Water Street in downtown to at the Mobile Regional Airport.\nNeighborhoods.\nMobile has a number of notable historic neighborhoods. These include &lt;a href=\"Ashland%20Place%20Historic%20District%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Ashland Place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campground%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Campground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Church%20Street%20East%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Church Street East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"De%20Tonti%20Square%20Historic%20District\"&gt;De Tonti Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leinkauf%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Leinkauf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Dauphin%20Street%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Lower Dauphin Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Historic%20District%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Midtown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oakleigh%20Garden%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Oakleigh Garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dauphin%20Way%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Old Dauphin Way&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Hill%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Spring Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Toulminville\"&gt;Toulminville&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nMobile's geographical location on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; provides a mild &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfa\"), with hot, humid summers and mild, rainy winters. The record low temperature was , set on February 13, 1899, and the record high was , set on August 29, 2000.\nA 2007 study by &lt;a href=\"Weatherbill\"&gt;WeatherBill, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; determined that Mobile is the wettest city in the contiguous 48 states, with of average annual rainfall over a 30-year period. Mobile averages 120 days per year with at least of rain. Precipitation is heavy year-round. On average, July and August are the wettest months, with frequent and often-heavy shower and thunderstorm activity. October stands out as a slightly drier month than all others. Snow is rare in Mobile, with its last snowfall occurring on December 8, 2017; before this, the last snowfall had been nearly four years earlier, on January 27, 2014.\nMobile is occasionally affected by major tropical storms and hurricanes. The city suffered a major natural disaster on the night of September 12, 1979, when &lt;a href=\"Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale\"&gt;category-3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Frederic\"&gt;Hurricane Frederic&lt;/a&gt; passed over the heart of the city. The storm caused tremendous damage to Mobile and the surrounding area. Mobile had moderate damage from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Opal\"&gt;Hurricane Opal&lt;/a&gt; on October 4, 1995, and &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ivan\"&gt;Hurricane Ivan&lt;/a&gt; on September 16, 2004.\nMobile suffered millions of dollars in damage from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; on August 29, 2005, which damaged much of the Gulf Coast cities. A storm surge of , topped by higher waves, damaged eastern sections of the city with extensive flooding in downtown, the &lt;a href=\"Battleship%20Parkway\"&gt;Battleship Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, and the elevated &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20Parkway\"&gt;Jubilee Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. As can be seen in the above 2005 photograph, floodwaters covered stairs of the entrance to the Federal Courthouse, located three blocks from the waterfront.\nChristmas Day tornado.\nIn late December 2012, the city suffered two tornado hits. On December 25, 2012, at 4:54 pm, a large &lt;a href=\"wedge%20tornado\"&gt;wedge tornado&lt;/a&gt; touched down in the city. The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved north-northeast at speeds of up to . The path took the tornado into &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Historic%20District%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Midtown&lt;/a&gt;, causing damage or destruction to at least 100 structures. The heaviest damage to houses was along Carlen Street, Rickarby Place, Dauphin Street, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Shell%20Road\"&gt;Old Shell Road&lt;/a&gt;, Margaret Street, Silverwood Street, and Springhill Avenue. In addition to residential structures, the tornado caused significant damage to the Carmelite Monastery, Little Flower Catholic Church, commercial real estate along &lt;a href=\"Airport%20Boulevard%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Airport Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Government%20Street%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Government Street&lt;/a&gt; in the Midtown at the Loop neighborhood, &lt;a href=\"Murphy%20High%20School%20%28Alabama%29\"&gt;Murphy High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Trinity Episcopal Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20Sha%27arai%20Shomayim%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Springhill Avenue Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and Mobile Infirmary Hospital before moving into the neighboring city of Prichard. The tornado was classified as an &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Fujita%20scale\"&gt;EF2&lt;/a&gt; tornado by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Weather%20Service\"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; on December 26.\nThe path taken through the city was just a short distance east of the path taken days earlier, on December 20, by an EF1 tornado which had touched down near &lt;a href=\"Davidson%20High%20School%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Davidson High School&lt;/a&gt; and taken a path ending in Prichard. Initial damage estimates for insured and uninsured ranged from $140 to $150 million.\nCulture.\nMobile's French and Spanish colonial history has given it a culture distinguished by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities in the state of Alabama. The annual &lt;a href=\"Carnival\"&gt;Carnival&lt;/a&gt; celebration is perhaps the best example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of &lt;a href=\"Mardi%20Gras\"&gt;Mardi Gras&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.\nCarnival in Mobile evolved over the course of 300 years from a beginning as a sedate French Catholic tradition into the mainstream multi-week celebration that today bridges a spectrum of cultures. Mobile's official cultural ambassadors are the &lt;a href=\"Azalea%20Trail%20Maids\"&gt;Azalea Trail Maids&lt;/a&gt;, meant to embody the ideals of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20hospitality\"&gt;Southern hospitality&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind\"&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977) and \"&lt;a href=\"Back%20Roads%20%281981%20film%29\"&gt;Back Roads&lt;/a&gt;\" (1981) were shot in Mobile.\nCarnival and Mardi Gras.\nThe Carnival season has expanded throughout the late fall and winter: &lt;a href=\"Ball%20%28dance%29\"&gt;balls&lt;/a&gt; in the city may be scheduled as early as November, with the &lt;a href=\"parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt;s beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on &lt;a href=\"Mardi%20Gras\"&gt;Mardi Gras&lt;/a&gt;, a moveable feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter. The next day is &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Wednesday\"&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;, the 40-day penitential season before Easter.\nIn Mobile, locals often use the term Mardi Gras as a shorthand to refer to the entire Carnival season. During the Carnival season; the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20society\"&gt;mystic societies&lt;/a&gt; build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown. Masked society members toss small gifts, known as 'throws,' to parade spectators. The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also hold formal &lt;a href=\"masquerade%20ball\"&gt;masquerade ball&lt;/a&gt;s, usually by invitation only, and oriented to adults.\nCarnival was first celebrated in Mobile in 1703 when colonial French Catholic settlers carried out their traditional celebration at the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mobile%20Site\"&gt;Old Mobile Site&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the 1711 relocation of the city to the current site. Mobile's first Carnival society was established in 1711 with the \"Boeuf Gras Society\" (Fatted Ox Society). Celebrations were relatively small and consisted of local, private parties until the early 19th century.\nIn 1830 Mobile's Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade. The Cowbellions got their start when Michael Krafft, a cotton factor from &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, began a parade with rakes, hoes, and cowbells. The \"Cowbellians\" introduced horse-drawn floats to the parades in 1840 with a parade entitled \"Heathen Gods and Goddesses\". The &lt;a href=\"Striker%27s%20Independent%20Society\"&gt;Striker's Independent Society&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 1843, is the oldest surviving mystic society in the United States.\nCarnival celebrations in Mobile were canceled during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. In 1866 &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Cain\"&gt;Joe Cain&lt;/a&gt; revived the Mardi Gras parades when he paraded through the city streets on Fat Tuesday while costumed as a fictional &lt;a href=\"Chickasaw\"&gt;Chickasaw&lt;/a&gt; chief named \"Slacabamorinico.\" He celebrated the day in front of the occupying &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; troops. In 2002, Mobile's &lt;a href=\"Tricentennial\"&gt;Tricentennial&lt;/a&gt; celebrated with parades that represented all of the city's mystic societies.\nFounded in 2004, the Conde Explorers in 2005 were the first integrated Mardi Gras society to parade in downtown Mobile. The society has about a hundred members and welcomes men and women of all races. In addition to the parade and ball, the Conde Explorers hold several parties throughout the year. Its members also perform volunteer work. The Conde Explorers were featured in the award-winning documentary, \"The Order of Myths\" (2008), by &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Brown\"&gt;Margaret Brown&lt;/a&gt; about Mobile's Mardi Gras.\nArchives and libraries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20African%20American%20Archives%20and%20Museum\"&gt;National African American Archives and Museum&lt;/a&gt; features the history of African-American participation in Mardi Gras, authentic artifacts from the era of slavery, and portraits and biographies of famous African Americans.

It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Mobile Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by Maestro Scott Speck. Space 301 Gallery and Studio was initially housed adjacent to the Saenger, but moved to its own space in 2008. The building, donated to the centre by the \"&lt;a href=\"Press-Register\"&gt;Press-Register&lt;/a&gt;\" after its relocation to a new modern facility, underwent a $5.2 million renovation and redesign prior to opening.

The racial makeup of the city was 50.6% &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;, 45.0% &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, 0.3% &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, 1.8% &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, 0.0% &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, 0.9% from &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28US%20Census%29\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, 1.4% from two or more races, and 2.4% of the population were Latino. &lt;a href=\"Non-Hispanic%20Whites\"&gt;Non-Hispanic Whites&lt;/a&gt; were 43.9% of the population in 2010, down from 62.1% in 1980. The average household size was 2.4 and the average family size was 3.07.

The median age was 35.7 years. The male population was 47.0% and the female population was 53.0%. The median income for a household in the city was $37,056 for 2006 to 2010. The per capita income for the city was $22,401.\nGovernment.\nSince 1985 the government of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member &lt;a href=\"city%20council\"&gt;city council&lt;/a&gt;. The mayor is elected &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt;, and the council members are elected from each of the seven city council &lt;a href=\"single-member%20districts\"&gt;single-member districts&lt;/a&gt; (SMDs). A &lt;a href=\"supermajority\"&gt;supermajority&lt;/a&gt; of five votes is required to conduct council business.\nThis form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which had three city commissioners, each elected at-large, was ruled in 1975 to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the &lt;a href=\"Voting%20Rights%20Act\"&gt;Voting Rights Act&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Mobile%20v.%20Bolden\"&gt;Bolden v. City of Mobile&lt;/a&gt;\". The three at-large commissioners each required a majority vote to win. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years and are nonpartisan.\nThe first mayor elected under the new system of &lt;a href=\"single-member%20district\"&gt;single-member district&lt;/a&gt; (SMD) voting was &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20R.%20Outlaw\"&gt;Arthur R. Outlaw&lt;/a&gt;, who served his second term as mayor from 1985 to 1989. His first term had been under the old system, from 1967 to 1968. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dow\"&gt;Mike Dow&lt;/a&gt; defeated Outlaw in the 1989 election; he was re-elected, serving as mayor for four terms, from 1989 to 2005. His \"The String of Pearls\" initiative, a series of projects designed to stimulate redevelopment of the city's core, is credited with reviving much of downtown Mobile. Upon his retirement, Dow endorsed &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Jones%20%28mayor%29\"&gt;Sam Jones&lt;/a&gt; as his successor.\nSam Jones was elected in 2005 as the first African-American mayor of Mobile. He was re-elected for a second term in 2009 without opposition. His administration continued the focus on downtown redevelopment and bringing industries to the city. He ran for a third term in 2013 but was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Stimpson\"&gt;Sandy Stimpson&lt;/a&gt;. Stimpson took office on November 4, 2013, and was re-elected on August 22, 2017.\nAs of January 2022, the seven-member city council is made up of Cory Penn from District 1, William Carroll from District 2, C.J. Small from District 3, Ben Reynolds from District 4, Joel Daves from District 5, Scott Jones from District 6, and Gina Gregory from District 7.\nEducation.\nPublic facilities.\nPublic schools in Mobile are operated by the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20County%20Public%20School%20System\"&gt;Mobile County Public School System&lt;/a&gt;.

Austal announced in October 2012, after winning a new defense contract and completing another building within their complex on the island, that it would expand its workforce from 3,000 to 4,500 employees.\n&lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Marine\"&gt;Atlantic Marine&lt;/a&gt; operated a major shipyard at the former Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company site on &lt;a href=\"Pinto%20Island\"&gt;Pinto Island&lt;/a&gt;. It was acquired by British defense conglomerate &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; in May 2010 for $352\u00a0million. Doing business as &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%20Southeast%20Shipyards\"&gt;BAE Systems Southeast Shipyards&lt;/a&gt;, the company continues to operate the site as a full-service shipyard, employing approximately 600 workers with plans to expand.\nMobile Aeroplex at Brookley.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Aeroplex%20at%20Brookley\"&gt;Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley&lt;/a&gt; is an industrial complex and airport located south of the central business district of the city. It is the largest industrial and transportation complex in the region, having more than 70 companies, many of which are &lt;a href=\"aerospace\"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt;, spread over . Notable employers at Brookley include &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; North America Engineering (&lt;a href=\"EADS%20North%20America\"&gt;Airbus Military North America&lt;/a&gt;'s facilities are at the Mobile Regional Airport), &lt;a href=\"ST%20Aerospace%20Mobile\"&gt;ST Aerospace Mobile&lt;/a&gt; (a division of &lt;a href=\"ST%20Engineering\"&gt;ST Engineering&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Motors%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Continental Motors&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlans for an &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A320%20family\"&gt;Airbus A320 family&lt;/a&gt; aircraft assembly plant in Mobile were formally announced by &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=\"Fabrice%20Br%C3%A9gier\"&gt;Fabrice Br\u00e9gier&lt;/a&gt; from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. It was planned to employ up roughly 1,000 full-time workers when fully operational. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony on April 8, 2013, with it becoming operable by 2015 and producing up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based &lt;a href=\"Hoar%20Construction\"&gt;Hoar Construction&lt;/a&gt; to oversee construction of the facility.\nThe factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.\nOn October 16, 2017, Airbus announced a partnership with &lt;a href=\"Bombardier%20Aerospace\"&gt;Bombardier Aerospace&lt;/a&gt;, taking over a majority share of the &lt;a href=\"Bombardier%20CSeries\"&gt;Bombardier CSeries&lt;/a&gt; airliner program. As a result of this partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort may allow the companies to circumvent high import tariffs on the CSeries family. The aircraft was renamed the Airbus A220 on July 10, 2018. Production started in August 2019; the first A220 from the new line is due to be delivered to Delta in the third quarter of 2020.\nThyssenKrupp.\nGerman technology conglomerate &lt;a href=\"ThyssenKrupp\"&gt;ThyssenKrupp&lt;/a&gt; broke ground on a $4.65 billion combined &lt;a href=\"stainless%20steel\"&gt;stainless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20steel\"&gt;carbon steel&lt;/a&gt; processing facility in Calvert, a few miles north of Mobile, in 2007. It was originally projected to eventually employ 2,700 people. The facility became operational in July 2010.\nThe company put both its carbon mill in Calvert and a steel slab-making unit in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; up for sale in May 2012, citing rising production costs and a worldwide decrease in demand. ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company &lt;a href=\"Outokumpu\"&gt;Outokumpu Oyi&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nTop employers.\nAccording to Mobile's 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city during 2019 were:\nUnemployment rate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor\"&gt;United States Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics\"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) for the Mobile Metropolitan Statistical Area was 7.5% for July 2013, compared with an unadjusted rate of 6.6% for Alabama as a whole and 7.4% for the entire nation.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nLocal airline passengers are served by the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Regional%20Airport\"&gt;Mobile Regional Airport&lt;/a&gt;, with direct connections to four major hub airports. It is served by &lt;a href=\"American%20Eagle%20%28airline%20brand%29\"&gt;American Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, with service to &lt;a href=\"Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charlotte/Douglas%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Charlotte/Douglas International Airport&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"United%20Express\"&gt;United Express&lt;/a&gt;, with service to &lt;a href=\"George%20Bush%20Intercontinental%20Airport\"&gt;George Bush Intercontinental Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Connection\"&gt;Delta Connection&lt;/a&gt;, with service to &lt;a href=\"Hartsfield-Jackson%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Downtown%20Airport\"&gt;Mobile Downtown Airport&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Aeroplex%20at%20Brookley\"&gt;Brookley Aeroplex&lt;/a&gt; serves corporate, cargo, and private aircraft.\nCycling paths.\nIn an effort to leverage Mobile's waterways for recreational use, as opposed to simply industrial use, The Three Mile Creek Greenway Trail is being designed and implemented under the instruction of the City Council. The linear park will ultimately span seven miles, from &lt;a href=\"Langan%20%28Municipal%29%20Park\"&gt;Langan (Municipal) Park&lt;/a&gt; to Dr. Martin Luther King Junior Avenue, and include trailheads, sidewalks, and bike lanes. The existing greenway is centered at Tricentennial Park.\nOther trails include the paved Mobile Airport Perimeter Trail, encircling the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Downtown%20Airport\"&gt;Mobile Downtown Airport&lt;/a&gt; and mountain biking trails on the west side of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South%20Alabama\"&gt;University of South Alabama&lt;/a&gt;.\nRail.\nMobile is served by four &lt;a href=\"Class%20I%20railroad\"&gt;Class I railroad&lt;/a&gt;s, including the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20National%20Railway\"&gt;Canadian National Railway&lt;/a&gt; (CNR), &lt;a href=\"CSX%20Transportation\"&gt;CSX Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (CSX), the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Southern%20Railway\"&gt;Kansas City Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt; (KCS), and the &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway\"&gt;Norfolk Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt; (NS). The &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20and%20Gulf%20Coast%20Railway\"&gt;Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway&lt;/a&gt; (AGR), a &lt;a href=\"Class%20III%20railroad\"&gt;Class III railroad&lt;/a&gt;, links Mobile to the &lt;a href=\"BNSF%20Railway\"&gt;Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway&lt;/a&gt; (BNSF) at &lt;a href=\"Amory%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Amory, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. These converge at the Port of Mobile, which provides &lt;a href=\"intermodal%20freight%20transport\"&gt;intermodal freight transport&lt;/a&gt; service to companies engaged in importing and exporting. Other railroads include the &lt;a href=\"CG%20Railway\"&gt;CG Railway&lt;/a&gt; (CGR), a rail ship service to &lt;a href=\"Coatzacoalcos\"&gt;Coatzacoalcos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Terminal%20Railway%20Alabama%20State%20Docks\"&gt;Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks&lt;/a&gt; (TASD), a &lt;a href=\"Switching%20and%20terminal%20railroad\"&gt;switching railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city was served by &lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Limited\"&gt;Sunset Limited&lt;/a&gt;\" passenger train service until 2005, when the service was suspended due to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. However, efforts to restart passenger rail service between Mobile and &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; were revived in 2019 by the 21-member Southern Rail Commission after receiving a $33 million Federal Railroad Administration grant in June of that year. Louisiana quickly dedicated its $10 million toward the project, and Mississippi initially balked before committing its $15 million sum but Governor &lt;a href=\"Kay%20Ivey\"&gt;Kay Ivey&lt;/a&gt; resisted committing the estimated $2.7 million state allocation from Alabama because of concerns regarding long-term financial commitments and potential competition with freight traffic from the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Mobile\"&gt;Port of Mobile&lt;/a&gt; The Winter of 2019 was marked by repeated postponement of votes by the Mobile City Council as it requested more information on how rail traffic from the port would be impacted and where the Amtrak station would be built as community support for the project became more vocal, especially among &lt;a href=\"millennials\"&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt;. A day before a deadline in the federal grant matching program being used to fund the project, the city council committed about $3 million in a 6\u20131 vote. About $2.2 million is still needed for infrastructure improvements and train station must still be built before service begins in 2023. Potential locations for the station include at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Government%20Street%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29\"&gt;Government Street&lt;/a&gt; in downtown and in the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Aeroplex%20at%20Brookley\"&gt;Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley&lt;/a&gt;, which is favored by the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Mobile\"&gt;Port of Mobile&lt;/a&gt;\nRoadways.\nTwo major &lt;a href=\"interstate%20highways\"&gt;interstate highways&lt;/a&gt; and a spur converge in Mobile. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010\"&gt;Interstate 10&lt;/a&gt; runs northeast to southwest across the city while &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2065\"&gt;Interstate 65&lt;/a&gt; starts in Mobile at Interstate 10 and runs north. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20165%20%28Alabama%29\"&gt;Interstate 165&lt;/a&gt; connects to Interstate 65 north of the city in &lt;a href=\"Prichard%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Prichard&lt;/a&gt; and joins Interstate 10 in downtown Mobile. Mobile is well served by many major highway systems. United States Highways &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Alabama\"&gt;US 31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"US%2043%20%28AL%29\"&gt;US 43&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"US%2045%20%28AL%29\"&gt;US 45&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"US%2090%20%28AL%29\"&gt;US 90&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"US%2098%20%28AL%29\"&gt;US 98&lt;/a&gt; radiate from Mobile traveling east, west, and north. Mobile has three routes east across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Baldwin County, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Interstate 10 leaves downtown through the &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace%20Tunnel\"&gt;George Wallace Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; under the river and then over the bay across the &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20Parkway\"&gt;Jubilee Parkway&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Fort%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Spanish Fort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daphne%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Daphne&lt;/a&gt;. US 98 leaves downtown through the &lt;a href=\"Bankhead%20Tunnel\"&gt;Bankhead Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; under the river, onto &lt;a href=\"Blakeley%20Island%20%28Alabama%29\"&gt;Blakeley Island&lt;/a&gt;, and then over the bay across the &lt;a href=\"Battleship%20Parkway\"&gt;Battleship Parkway&lt;/a&gt; into Spanish Fort, Alabama. US 90 travels over the &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%E2%80%93Africatown%20USA%20Bridge\"&gt;Cochrane\u2013Africatown USA Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to the north of downtown onto Blakeley Island where it becomes co-routed with US 98.\nMobile's public transportation is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Wave%20Transit%20System\"&gt;Wave Transit System&lt;/a&gt; which features buses with 18 fixed routes and neighborhood service. Baylinc is a public transportation bus service provided by the Baldwin Rural Transit System in cooperation with the Wave Transit System that provides service between eastern &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Baldwin County&lt;/a&gt; and downtown Mobile. Baylinc operates Monday through Friday.\n&lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20Lines\"&gt;Greyhound Lines&lt;/a&gt; provides intercity bus service between Mobile and many locations throughout the United States. Mobile is served by several taxi and limousine services.\nWater.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Mobile\"&gt;Port of Mobile&lt;/a&gt; has public, deepwater terminals with direct access to of inland and intracoastal waterways serving the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20River\"&gt;Tennessee river&lt;/a&gt; valleys (via the &lt;a href=\"Tennessee-Tombigbee%20Waterway\"&gt;Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The Alabama State Port Authority owns and operates the public terminals at the Port of Mobile. The public terminals handle &lt;a href=\"Containerization\"&gt;containerized&lt;/a&gt;, bulk, breakbulk, &lt;a href=\"roll-on/roll-off\"&gt;roll-on/roll-off&lt;/a&gt;, and heavy-lift cargoes. The port is also home to private bulk terminal operators, as well as a number of highly specialized shipbuilding and repair companies with two of the largest floating dry docks on the Gulf Coast.\nThe city was a home port for &lt;a href=\"cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruise ship&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Cruise%20Lines\"&gt;Carnival Cruise Lines&lt;/a&gt;. The first cruise ship to call the port home was the \"&lt;a href=\"Holiday%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Holiday&lt;/a&gt;\", which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could take its place. The \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Fantasy\"&gt;Carnival Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;\" operated from Mobile from then on until the \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Elation\"&gt;Carnival Elation&lt;/a&gt;\" arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual &lt;a href=\"interest\"&gt;debt service&lt;/a&gt; of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Fantasy\"&gt;Carnival Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;\" was relocating from Miami, Florida to Mobile, Alabama after a five-year absence and would offer four and five night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017. The four night cruises will visit Cozumel, Mexico while the five night cruises will additionally visit Costa Maya or Progreso. Her first departure from Mobile left on November 9, 2016, on a five night cruise to Cozumel and Progreso. \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Fascination\"&gt;Carnival Fascination&lt;/a&gt;\" will be replacing \"Carnival Fantasy\" in 2022.\nAlthough Carnival Cruise Lines did not operate from Mobile after the Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Triumph\"&gt;Carnival Triumph&lt;/a&gt;\" was towed into the port following a crippling engine room fire. It was the largest cruise ship ever to dock at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the \"&lt;a href=\"Carnival%20Conquest\"&gt;Carnival Conquest&lt;/a&gt;\", which docked in Mobile when the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20New%20Orleans\"&gt;Port of New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.\nMedia.\nPrint.\nMobile's \"&lt;a href=\"Press-Register\"&gt;Press-Register&lt;/a&gt;\" is Alabama's oldest active newspaper, first published in 1813. The paper focuses on &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Baldwin&lt;/a&gt; counties and the city of Mobile, but also serves southwestern Alabama and southeastern Mississippi. Mobile's alternative newspaper is the \"&lt;a href=\"Lagniappe%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Lagniappe&lt;/a&gt;\". The Mobile area's local magazine is \"Mobile Bay Monthly\". The \"Mobile Beacon\" is an alternative focusing on the African-American communities of Mobile. &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Mobilian\"&gt;Mod Mobilian&lt;/a&gt; is a website with a focus on cultured living in Mobile.\nTelevision.\nMobile is served locally by a number of over-the-air television stations.
