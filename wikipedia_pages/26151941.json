    "text": "William Macbride Childs (1869\u20131939) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; academic administrator and historian, who was involved in the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Reading\"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; and who served briefly as its first &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20%28education%29\"&gt;vice-chancellor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nChilds was born, on 3 January 1869, in the village of &lt;a href=\"Carrington%2C%20Lincolnshire\"&gt;Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, situated some north of &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Lincolnshire\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;. He was the son of the Revd William Linington Childs, vicar of Carrington, and his second wife, Henrietta Fowles Bell. He had no brothers or sisters, but had a half-brother and two half-sisters by his father's first marriage. He attended &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Portsmouth Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Keble%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Keble College&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; in 1891.\nIn 1892 Childs served briefly as a secretary to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Arthur%20Dyke%20Acland%2C%2013th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Arthur Dyke Acland&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Education%20and%20Skills\"&gt;Vice-President of the Committee on Education&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; post that then supervised &lt;a href=\"education%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;education in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. In 1893 he became a &lt;a href=\"lecturer\"&gt;lecturer&lt;/a&gt; in history at the &lt;a href=\"University%20College%2C%20Reading\"&gt;University College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;, being promoted to vice-principal in 1900.\nIn 1903 Childs succeeded &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Mackinder\"&gt;Halford Mackinder&lt;/a&gt; as principal of the college. He made it his aim to turn the college into a University, working to this end by attracting students from a distance with hostels and, eventually, halls of residence. He also raised funds from prominent local residents, including &lt;a href=\"George%20William%20Palmer%20%28England%29\"&gt;George William Palmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Palmer%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Alfred Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, both proprietors of &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20%26amp%3B%20Palmers\"&gt;Huntley &amp; Palmers&lt;/a&gt;, and Harriet Loyd-Lindsay, wife of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Loyd-Lindsay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wantage\"&gt;Robert, 1st Baron Wantage&lt;/a&gt;. His first application for a charter, in 1920, was turned down, but a second application, in 1925, succeeded. In 1926, when the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Reading\"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; officially received that charter, Childs became the first vice-chancellor, being born aloft by his students and carried around the grounds.\nChilds retired at the age of 60, in 1929. He died on 21 June 1939 at his home at &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Hermitage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;. Childs Hall, a hall of residence on the University of Reading's &lt;a href=\"Whiteknights%20Park\"&gt;Whiteknights Park&lt;/a&gt; campus, is named in honour of William Macbride Childs."
