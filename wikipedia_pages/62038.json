    "text": "Man Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890\u00a0\u2013 November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. He was a significant contributor to the &lt;a href=\"Dada\"&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surrealism\"&gt;Surrealist&lt;/a&gt; movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20artistic%20media\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his pioneering photography, and he was a renowned &lt;a href=\"fashion%20photography\"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt; and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with &lt;a href=\"photogram\"&gt;photogram&lt;/a&gt;s, which he called \"rayographs\" in reference to himself.\nBiography.\nBackground and early life.\nDuring his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.\nMan Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky. He was born in &lt;a href=\"South%20Philadelphia\"&gt;South Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, on August 27, 1890. He was the eldest child of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia%23United%20States\"&gt;Russian Jewish immigrants&lt;/a&gt; Melach \"Max\" Radnitzky, a tailor, and Manya \"Minnie\" Radnitzky (n\u00e9e Lourie or Luria). He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dorothy \"Dora\" and Essie (or Elsie), the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the &lt;a href=\"Williamsburg%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Williamsburg&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20group\"&gt;ethnic&lt;/a&gt; discrimination and &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called \"Manny\" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.\nMan Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing &lt;a href=\"patchwork\"&gt;patchwork&lt;/a&gt; items from scraps of fabric. Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. &lt;a href=\"Mannequin\"&gt;Mannequin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Clothes%20iron\"&gt;flat irons&lt;/a&gt;, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, &lt;a href=\"Textile\"&gt;swatches of fabric&lt;/a&gt;, and other items related to tailoring appear in almost every &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20artistic%20media\"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; of his work. Art historians have noted similarities between Ray's collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.\nMason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Museum%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Jewish Museum&lt;/a&gt; in New York, \"Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention\", suggests that the artist may have been \"the first Jewish avant-garde artist.\"\nMan Ray was the uncle of the photographer &lt;a href=\"Naomi%20Savage\"&gt;Naomi Savage&lt;/a&gt;, who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.\nFirst artistic endeavors.\nMan Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's &lt;a href=\"Boys%20and%20Girls%20High%20School\"&gt;Boys' High School&lt;/a&gt; from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in &lt;a href=\"technical%20drawing\"&gt;drafting&lt;/a&gt; and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Master\"&gt;Old Master&lt;/a&gt;s. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his &lt;a href=\"studio\"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a &lt;a href=\"commercial%20art\"&gt;commercial art&lt;/a&gt;ist and was a &lt;a href=\"Technical%20illustration\"&gt;technical illustrator&lt;/a&gt; at several &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; companies.\nThe surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Stieglitz\"&gt;Alfred Stieglitz&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"291%20%28art%20gallery%29\"&gt;291&lt;/a&gt;\" gallery and works by the &lt;a href=\"Ashcan%20School\"&gt;Ashcan School&lt;/a&gt;. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Academy%20of%20Design\"&gt;National Academy of Design&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Art%20Students%20League%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Art Students League&lt;/a&gt;, were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Modern%20School%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Ferrer School&lt;/a&gt; in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.\nNew York.\nWhile living in New York City, Man Ray was influenced by the avant-garde practices of European contemporary artists he was introduced to at the 1913 &lt;a href=\"Armory%20Show\"&gt;Armory Show&lt;/a&gt; and in visits to Alfred Stieglitz's \"291\" art gallery. His early paintings display facets of &lt;a href=\"cubism\"&gt;cubism&lt;/a&gt;. After befriending &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Duchamp\"&gt;Marcel Duchamp&lt;/a&gt;, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in \"The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows\" (1916).\nIn 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in &lt;a href=\"Grantwood%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Grantwood, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, across the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; from New York City. His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled \"Self-Portrait\", was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918, after initially picking up the camera to document his own artwork.\nMan Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with &lt;a href=\"Dada\"&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;, a radical anti-art movement. He published two Dadaist periodicals, that each only had one issue, \"The Ridgefield Gazook\" (1915) and \"TNT\" (1919), the latter co-edited by &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Wolff\"&gt;Adolf Wolff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Dawson\"&gt;Mitchell Dawson&lt;/a&gt;. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of \"Rope Dancer\", he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he worked with &lt;a href=\"Readymades%20of%20Marcel%20Duchamp\"&gt;readymades&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gift%20%28sculpture%29\"&gt;Gift&lt;/a&gt;\" readymade (1921) is a &lt;a href=\"Clothes%20iron\"&gt;flatiron&lt;/a&gt; with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and \"Enigma of Isidore Ducasse\" is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. \"Aerograph\" (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.\nIn 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the \"&lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Duchamp%23Kinetic%20art\"&gt;Rotary Glass Plates&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the earliest examples of &lt;a href=\"kinetic%20art\"&gt;kinetic art&lt;/a&gt;. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Dreier\"&gt;Katherine Dreier&lt;/a&gt;, and Duchamp founded the &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Anonyme%20%28art%29\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme&lt;/a&gt;, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of &lt;a href=\"modern%20art\"&gt;modern art&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;Yale University Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.\nMan Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Dada\"&gt;New York Dada&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York. He wrote that \"Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival.\"\nIn 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887\u20131975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.\nParis.\nIn July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the &lt;a href=\"Montparnasse\"&gt;Montparnasse&lt;/a&gt; quarter favored by many artists. His accidental rediscovery of the cameraless &lt;a href=\"photogram\"&gt;photogram&lt;/a&gt;, which he called \"rayographs\", resulted in mysterious images hailed by &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20Tzara\"&gt;Tristan Tzara&lt;/a&gt; as \"pure Dada creations\".\nShortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse (&lt;a href=\"Alice%20Prin\"&gt;Alice Prin&lt;/a&gt;), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images, and starred in his &lt;a href=\"experimental%20film\"&gt;experimental film&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Retour%20%C3%A0%20la%20Raison\"&gt;Le Retour \u00e0 la Raison&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"L%27%C3%89toile%20de%20mer\"&gt;L'\u00c9toile de mer&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Miller\"&gt;Lee Miller&lt;/a&gt;. She left him in 1932. Man Ray was in a relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Guadeloupean\"&gt;Guadeloupean&lt;/a&gt; dancer and model Adrienne Fidelin from late 1934 until August 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family. Unlike the artist's other significant muses, Fidelin has largely been written out of his life story.\nMan Ray was a pioneering photographer in Paris for two decades between the wars. Significant members of the art world, such as &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Picasso\"&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tristan%20Tzara\"&gt;Tristan Tzara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Joyce\"&gt;James Joyce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gertrude%20Stein\"&gt;Gertrude Stein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Cocteau\"&gt;Jean Cocteau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD\"&gt;Salvador Dal\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peggy%20Guggenheim\"&gt;Peggy Guggenheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridget%20Bate%20Tichenor\"&gt;Bridget Bate Tichenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luisa%20Casati\"&gt;Luisa Casati&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Antonin%20Artaud\"&gt;Antonin Artaud&lt;/a&gt;, posed for his camera. Man Ray's international fame as a portrait photographer is reflected in a series of photographs of &lt;a href=\"Maharajah\"&gt;Maharajah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yashwant%20Rao%20Holkar%20II\"&gt;Yashwant Rao Holkar II&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Sanyogita Devi from their visit to Europe in 1927. His practice of photographing African objects in the Paris collections of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Guillaume\"&gt;Paul Guillaume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Ratton\"&gt;Charles Ratton&lt;/a&gt; and others led to several iconic photographs, including \"Noire et blanche\". As Man Ray scholar Wendy A. Grossman has illustrated, \"no one was more influential in translating the vogue for African art into a Modernist photographic aesthetic than Man Ray.\"\nMan Ray was represented in the first &lt;a href=\"Surrealism\"&gt;Surrealist&lt;/a&gt; exhibition with &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Arp\"&gt;Jean Arp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ernst\"&gt;Max Ernst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Masson\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Masson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Mir%C3%B3\"&gt;Joan Mir\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Picasso\"&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt; at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled \"&lt;a href=\"Object%20to%20Be%20Destroyed\"&gt;Object to Be Destroyed&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"Violon d'Ingres\", a stunning photograph of &lt;a href=\"Kiki%20de%20Montparnasse\"&gt;Kiki de Montparnasse&lt;/a&gt;, styled after the painter/musician &lt;a href=\"Jean-Auguste-Dominique%20Ingres\"&gt;Ingres&lt;/a&gt;. \"Violon d'Ingres\" is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.\nMan Ray directed a number of influential &lt;a href=\"avant-garde\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; short films, known as \"&lt;a href=\"Cin%C3%A9ma%20Pur\"&gt;Cin\u00e9ma Pur&lt;/a&gt;\". He directed \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Retour%20%C3%A0%20la%20Raison\"&gt;Le Retour \u00e0 la Raison&lt;/a&gt;\" (2 mins, 1923); \"&lt;a href=\"Emak-Bakia\"&gt;Emak-Bakia&lt;/a&gt;\" (16 mins, 1926); \"&lt;a href=\"L%27%C3%89toile%20de%20Mer\"&gt;L'\u00c9toile de Mer&lt;/a&gt;\" (15 mins, 1928); and \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Myst%C3%A8res%20du%20Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20D%C3%A9\"&gt;Les Myst\u00e8res du Ch\u00e2teau de D\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\" (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film \"&lt;a href=\"Anemic%20Cinema\"&gt;Anemic Cinema&lt;/a&gt;\" (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on &lt;a href=\"Fernand%20L%C3%A9ger\"&gt;Fernand L\u00e9ger&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ballet%20M%C3%A9canique\"&gt;Ballet M\u00e9canique&lt;/a&gt;\" (1924). In &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Clair\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Clair&lt;/a&gt;'s film \"&lt;a href=\"Entr%27acte%20%28film%29\"&gt;Entr'acte&lt;/a&gt;\" (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; with Duchamp. Duchamp, Man Ray, and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Picabia\"&gt;Francis Picabia&lt;/a&gt; were all friends and collaborators, connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.\nIn the winter of 1933, surrealist artist &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9ret%20Oppenheim\"&gt;M\u00e9ret Oppenheim&lt;/a&gt;, known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a &lt;a href=\"printing%20press\"&gt;printing press&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Miller\"&gt;Lee Miller&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"photographic%20assistant\"&gt;photographic assistant&lt;/a&gt; and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of &lt;a href=\"Solarization%20%28photography%29\"&gt;solarization&lt;/a&gt;.\nHollywood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; forced Man Ray to return from Paris to the United States. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, Man Ray met &lt;a href=\"Juliet%20Browner\"&gt;Juliet Browner&lt;/a&gt;, a first-generation &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20American\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Romanian-Jewish\"&gt;Romanian-Jewish&lt;/a&gt; lineage. She was a trained dancer, who studied dance with &lt;a href=\"Martha%20Graham\"&gt;Martha Graham&lt;/a&gt;, and an experienced artists' model. The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ernst\"&gt;Max Ernst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dorothea%20Tanning\"&gt;Dorothea Tanning&lt;/a&gt;. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the &lt;a href=\"William%20Copley%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Copley Galleries&lt;/a&gt; in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the \"Shakespearean Equations\" series.\nLater life.\nMan Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue F\u00e9rou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, where he continued his creative practice across mediums. During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Schwarz\"&gt;Arturo Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1963, he published his autobiography, \"Self-Portrait\" (which was republished in 1999).\nHe died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the &lt;a href=\"Cimeti%C3%A8re%20du%20Montparnasse\"&gt;Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. His epitaph reads \"unconcerned, but not indifferent\". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads \"together again\". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the &lt;a href=\"Pompidou%20Centre\"&gt;Pompidou Centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nInnovations.\nMan Ray was responsible for several technical innovations in modern art, filmmaking, and photography. These included his use of &lt;a href=\"photogram\"&gt;photogram&lt;/a&gt;s to produce surrealist images he called \"Rayograms\", and &lt;a href=\"solarization\"&gt;solarization&lt;/a&gt; (discovered with Lee Miller). His 1923 experimental film \"Le Retour \u00e0 la raison\" was the first 'cine-rayograph', a motion picture made without the use of a camera. Ray's 1935 \"Space Writing (Self-Portrait)\" was the first &lt;a href=\"light%20painting\"&gt;light painting&lt;/a&gt;, predating Picasso's 1949 light paintings, photographed by &lt;a href=\"Gjon%20Mili\"&gt;Gjon Mili&lt;/a&gt;, by fourteen years.\nAccolades.\nIn 1974, Man Ray received the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Photographic%20Society\"&gt;Royal Photographic Society&lt;/a&gt;'s Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship \"in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.\" In 1999, \"&lt;a href=\"ARTnews\"&gt;ARTnews&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, \"his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, &lt;a href=\"collage\"&gt;collage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"assemblage%20%28art%29\"&gt;assemblage&lt;/a&gt; and prototypes of what would eventually be called &lt;a href=\"performance%20art\"&gt;performance art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conceptual%20art\"&gt;conceptual art&lt;/a&gt;.\" \"ARTnews\" further stated that \"Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a creative intelligence that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would.\"\nArt market.\nOn 9 November 2017 Man Ray's \"&lt;a href=\"Noire%20et%20Blanche\"&gt;Noire et Blanche&lt;/a&gt;\" (1926), formerly in the collection of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Doucet%20%28fashion%20designer%29\"&gt;Jacques Doucet&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased at Christie's Paris for \u20ac2,688,750 (US$3,120,658), becoming the 14th most expensive photograph to ever sell at auction. This was a record not only for Man Ray's work in the photographic medium but also for the sale at auction of any vintage photograph.\nOnly two other works by Man Ray in any medium have commanded more at auction than the price captured by the 2017 sale of \"Noire et blanche.\" His 1916 canvas \"Promenade\" sold for $5,877,000 on 6 November 2013, at the Sotheby's New York Impressionist &amp; Modern Art Sale. And on 13 November 2017, his assemblage titled \"Catherine Barometer\" (1920), sold for $3,252,500 at &lt;a href=\"Christie%27s\"&gt;Christie's&lt;/a&gt; in New York.\nLegacy.\n\"Self-Portrait\" was republished in 1999.\nIn March 2013, Man Ray's photograph \"&lt;a href=\"Noire%20et%20Blanche\"&gt;Noire et Blanche&lt;/a&gt;\" (1926) was featured in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Modern Art in America\" series of stamps."
