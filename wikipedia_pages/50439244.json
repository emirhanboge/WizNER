Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. RB Leipzig also participated in the season's edition of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Germany%23German%20Cup\"&gt;domestic cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"DFB-Pokal\"&gt;DFB-Pokal&lt;/a&gt;. The season covers a period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.\nReview.\nBackground.\nOn 6 May 2016, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Hasenh%C3%BCttl\"&gt;Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to replace &lt;a href=\"Ralf%20Rangnick\"&gt;Ralf Rangnick&lt;/a&gt; as the head coach. On 8 May 2016, RB Leipzig was directly promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; after securing second position in the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2015\u201316 2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecember.\nOn 3 December, Leipzig faced &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt; at home on matchday 13. The match finished as a 2\u20131 win for RB Leipzig. RBL opened the scoring in the second minute from the penalty spot via &lt;a href=\"Timo%20Werner\"&gt;Timo Werner&lt;/a&gt;. Two minutes later, &lt;a href=\"Yussuf%20Poulsen\"&gt;Yussuf Poulsen&lt;/a&gt; missed two opportunities in a row to extend the lead for Leipzig. Poulsen again missed an opportunity in the 29th minute, missing a metre away from goal. Two minutes later, &lt;a href=\"Sead%20Kola%C5%A1inac\"&gt;Sead Kola\u0161inac&lt;/a&gt; scored the equaliser for Schalke, after the ball was parried by RB goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20Gul%C3%A1csi\"&gt;P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi&lt;/a&gt;. Two minutes into the second half, &lt;a href=\"Sead%20Kola%C5%A1inac\"&gt;Sead Kola\u0161inac&lt;/a&gt; scored an own goal from a free kick from Leipzig's &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Forsberg\"&gt;Emil Forsberg&lt;/a&gt;. Leipzig had further opportunities to score, but failed to capitalise. This includes a chance for Poulsen in the 64th minute from a corner, from &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Halstenberg\"&gt;Marcel Halstenberg&lt;/a&gt; in the 74th minute with a header onto the bar, and two opportunities for &lt;a href=\"Naby%20Ke%C3%AFta\"&gt;Naby Ke\u00efta&lt;/a&gt; in the 81st and 83rd minute. Leipzig goalkeeper Gul\u00e1csi preserved their lead with three consecutive saves in the 77th minute. The final opportunities fell to Poulsen in the 84th minute and &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Forsberg\"&gt;Emil Forsberg&lt;/a&gt; in the 88th, yet both were unable to extend the lead. This proved to be enough, as Leipzig secured their 8th consecutive victory and maintained their position at the top of the table.\nStatistics.\nAppearances and goals.\n! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Goalkeepers\n! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Defenders\n! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Midfielders\n! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Forwards\n! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Players transferred out during the season"
