    "text": "Anglo-Catholicism, Anglican Catholicism, or Catholic Anglicanism comprises people, beliefs and practices within &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglicanism&lt;/a&gt; that emphasise the &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; heritage and identity of the various Anglican churches.\nThe term \"Anglo-Catholic\" was coined in the early 19th century, although movements emphasising the Catholic nature of Anglicanism had already existed. Particularly influential in the history of Anglo-Catholicism were the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Divines\"&gt;Caroline Divines&lt;/a&gt; of the 17th century, the &lt;a href=\"Jacobitism\"&gt;Jacobite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nonjuring%20schism\"&gt;Nonjuring schism&lt;/a&gt; of the 17th- and 18th-centuries, and the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Movement\"&gt;Oxford Movement&lt;/a&gt;, which began at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; in 1833 and ushered in a period of Anglican history known as the \"Catholic Revival\".\nA minority of Anglo-Catholics, sometimes called &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Papalism\"&gt;Anglican Papalists&lt;/a&gt;, consider themselves under &lt;a href=\"papal%20supremacy\"&gt;papal supremacy&lt;/a&gt; even though they are not in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Such Anglo-Catholics, especially in England, often celebrate Mass according to the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20of%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;contemporary Roman Catholic rite&lt;/a&gt; and are concerned with seeking reunion with the Roman Catholic Church.\nIn addition, members of the &lt;a href=\"personal%20ordinariate\"&gt;personal ordinariate&lt;/a&gt;s for former Anglicans created by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes unofficially referred to as \"Anglican Catholics\".\nHistory.\nFollowing the passing of the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Act of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt;'s break with the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; continued to adhere to traditional Catholic teachings and did not initially make any alterations to doctrine. The \"&lt;a href=\"Ten%20Articles\"&gt;Ten Articles&lt;/a&gt;\" were published in 1536 and constitute the first official Anglican articles of faith. The articles for the most part concurred with the teachings of the Church in England as they had been prior to the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt; and defended, among other things, the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist\"&gt;Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"sacrament\"&gt;sacrament&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Confession%20%28religion%29\"&gt;Confession&lt;/a&gt;, the honouring and &lt;a href=\"Intercession%20of%20saints\"&gt;invocation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20saints\"&gt;Christian saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"prayer%20for%20the%20dead\"&gt;prayer for the dead&lt;/a&gt;. Belief in &lt;a href=\"purgatory\"&gt;purgatory&lt;/a&gt;, however, was made non-essential. This was followed by the \"&lt;a href=\"Thirty-nine%20Articles%23Bishops.27%20Book%20.281537.29\"&gt;Institution of the Christian Man&lt;/a&gt;\" (also called \"The Bishops' Book\") in 1537, a combined effort by numerous clergy and theologians which\u2014though not strongly Protestant in its inclinations\u2014showed a slight move towards Reformed positions. \"The Bishops' Book\" was unpopular with conservative sections of the Church, and quickly grew to be disliked by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; as well. The \"&lt;a href=\"Six%20Articles%20%281539%29\"&gt;Six Articles&lt;/a&gt;\", released two years later, moved away from all Reformed ideas and strongly affirmed Catholic positions regarding matters such as &lt;a href=\"transubstantiation\"&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20for%20the%20dead\"&gt;Mass for the dead&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Book\"&gt;King's Book&lt;/a&gt;\", the official article of religion written by Henry in 1543, likewise expressed Catholic sacramental theology and encouraged prayer for the dead.\nA major shift in Anglican doctrine came in the reign of Henry's son, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VI\"&gt;Edward VI&lt;/a&gt;, who repealed the \"Six Articles\" and under whose rule the Church of England became more identifiably Protestant. Though the Church's practices and approach to the sacraments became strongly influenced by those of continental reformers, it nevertheless retained &lt;a href=\"episcopal%20polity\"&gt;episcopal&lt;/a&gt; church structure. The Church of England was then briefly reunited with the Roman Catholic Church under &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt;, before separating again under &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement\"&gt;Elizabethan Religious Settlement&lt;/a&gt; was an attempt to end the religious divisions among Christians in England, and is often seen as an important event in Anglican history, ultimately laying the foundations for the \"\"&lt;a href=\"via%20media\"&gt;via media&lt;/a&gt;\"\" concept of Anglicanism.\nThe nature of early Anglicanism was to be of great importance to the Anglo-Catholics of the 19th century, who would argue that their beliefs and practices were common during this period and were inoffensive to the earliest members of the Church of England.\nCaroline Divines.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Divines\"&gt;Caroline Divines&lt;/a&gt; were a group of influential Anglican theologians active in the 17th century who opposed &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheranism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Puritanism\"&gt;Puritanism&lt;/a&gt; and stressed the importance of &lt;a href=\"episcopal%20polity\"&gt;episcopal polity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20succession\"&gt;apostolic succession&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"sacraments\"&gt;sacraments&lt;/a&gt;. The Caroline Divines also favoured elaborate liturgy (in some cases favouring the liturgy of the pre-Reformation church) and aesthetics. Their influence saw a revival in the use of images and statues in churches.\nThe leaders of the Anglo-Catholic revival in the 19th century would draw heavily from the works of the Caroline Divines.\nOxford Movement.\nThe modern Anglo-Catholic movement began with the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Movement\"&gt;Oxford Movement&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes termed \"Tractarianism\".\nIn the early 19th century, various factors caused misgivings among English church people, including the decline of church life and the spread of unconventional practices in the Church of England. The British government's action in 1833 of beginning a reduction in the number of &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; bishoprics and archbishoprics inspired a sermon from &lt;a href=\"John%20Keble\"&gt;John Keble&lt;/a&gt; in the University Church in Oxford on the subject of \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Apostasy\"&gt;National Apostasy&lt;/a&gt;\". This sermon marked the inception of what became known as the Oxford Movement.\nThe principal objective of the Oxford Movement was the defence of the Church of England as a divinely founded institution, of the doctrine of &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20succession\"&gt;apostolic succession&lt;/a&gt; and of the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer\"&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;\" as a \"rule of faith\". The key idea was that Anglicanism was not a &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; denomination but a &lt;a href=\"Branch%20theory\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt; of the historic Catholic Church, along with the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Scandinavian Lutheran Churches&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodoxy\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; churches. It was argued that Anglicanism had preserved the historical apostolic succession of priests and bishops and thus the Catholic &lt;a href=\"sacrament\"&gt;sacrament&lt;/a&gt;s. These ideas were promoted in a series of ninety \"&lt;a href=\"Tracts%20for%20the%20Times\"&gt;Tracts for the Times&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe principal leaders of the Oxford Movement were &lt;a href=\"John%20Keble\"&gt;John Keble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Newman\"&gt;John Henry Newman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Bouverie%20Pusey\"&gt;Edward Bouverie Pusey&lt;/a&gt;. The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by some bishops of the Church and by the &lt;a href=\"latitudinarian\"&gt;latitudinarian&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Within the Oxford movement, there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1845, the university censured a tract entitled \"Ideal of a Christian Church\" and its author, the pro-Roman Catholic theologian W. G. Ward, on which basis was imputed the moniker \"&lt;a href=\"W.%20G.%20Ward\"&gt;Ideal Ward&lt;/a&gt;\". The year 1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical cleric &lt;a href=\"George%20Cornelius%20Gorham\"&gt;George Cornelius Gorham&lt;/a&gt; in a celebrated legal action against church authorities. Consequently, some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship were received into the Roman Catholic Church, while others, such as &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Pattison%20%28academic%29\"&gt;Mark Pattison&lt;/a&gt;, embraced &lt;a href=\"Latitudinarian\"&gt;Latitudinarian&lt;/a&gt; Anglicanism, and yet others, such as &lt;a href=\"James%20Anthony%20Froude\"&gt;James Anthony Froude&lt;/a&gt;, became &lt;a href=\"Religious%20skepticism\"&gt;sceptics&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism.\nRecent developments.\nSince at least the 1970s, Anglo-Catholicism has been dividing into two distinct camps, along a fault-line which can perhaps be traced back to Bishop &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gore\"&gt;Charles Gore&lt;/a&gt;'s work in the 19th century.\nThe Oxford Movement had been inspired in the first place by a rejection of &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"latitudinarianism\"&gt;latitudinarianism&lt;/a&gt; in favour of the traditional faith of the \"Church Catholic\", defined by the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt; and the common doctrines of the historical &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Christianity\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Christianity\"&gt;western Christian churches&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of the emphasis on upholding traditions, until the 1970s most Anglo-Catholics rejected liberalising development such as the conferral of &lt;a href=\"holy%20orders\"&gt;holy orders&lt;/a&gt; on women. Present-day \"traditionalist\" Anglo-Catholics seek to maintain tradition and to keep Anglican doctrine in line with that of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. They often ally themselves with conservative &lt;a href=\"evangelical%20Anglicans\"&gt;evangelical Anglicans&lt;/a&gt; to defend traditional teachings on &lt;a href=\"Fornication%23Christianity\"&gt;sexual morality&lt;/a&gt; and women's roles in the Church. The main organisation in the Church of England that opposes the ordination of women, &lt;a href=\"Forward%20in%20Faith\"&gt;Forward in Faith&lt;/a&gt;, is largely composed of Anglo-Catholics.\n&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gore\"&gt;Gore's&lt;/a&gt; work, however, bearing the mark of liberal Protestant &lt;a href=\"higher%20criticism\"&gt;higher criticism&lt;/a&gt;, paved the way for an alternative form of Anglo-Catholicism influenced by &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberal theology&lt;/a&gt;. Thus in recent years, many Anglo-Catholics have accepted the &lt;a href=\"ordination%20of%20women\"&gt;ordination of women&lt;/a&gt;, the use of &lt;a href=\"inclusive%20language\"&gt;inclusive language&lt;/a&gt; in Bible translations and the liturgy, and progressive attitudes towards homosexuality and the blessing of &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same sex unions&lt;/a&gt;. Such Anglicans often refer to themselves as \"&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Anglo-Catholicism\"&gt;Liberal Anglo-Catholics&lt;/a&gt;\". The more \"progressive\" or \"liberal\" style of Anglo-Catholicism is represented by &lt;a href=\"Affirming%20Catholicism\"&gt;Affirming Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Catholic%20Priests\"&gt;Society of Catholic Priests&lt;/a&gt;.\nA third strand of Anglican Catholicism criticises elements of both liberalism and conservatism, drawing instead on the 20th century Roman Catholic \"&lt;a href=\"Nouvelle%20Th%C3%A9ologie\"&gt;Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie&lt;/a&gt;\", especially &lt;a href=\"Henri%20de%20Lubac\"&gt;Henri de Lubac&lt;/a&gt;. This movement rejected the dominance of &lt;a href=\"Thomism\"&gt;Thomism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neo-Scholasticism\"&gt;Neo-Scholasticism&lt;/a&gt; in Catholic theology, and advocated instead for a \"return to the sources\" of the Christian faith (scripture and the writings of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt;) while remaining open to dialogue with the contemporary world on issues of theology. &lt;a href=\"John%20Milbank\"&gt;John Milbank&lt;/a&gt; and others within this strand have been instrumental in the creation of the ecumenical (though predominantly Anglican and Roman Catholic) movement known as &lt;a href=\"radical%20orthodoxy\"&gt;radical orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome traditionalist Anglo-Catholics have left official Anglicanism to form \"&lt;a href=\"Continuing%20Anglican%20Movement\"&gt;continuing Anglican churches&lt;/a&gt;\" such as those in the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Anglican Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Traditional Anglican Communion&lt;/a&gt;. Others such as &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Widdecombe\"&gt;Ann Widdecombe&lt;/a&gt; have left Anglicanism altogether for the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches, in the belief that liberal doctrinal changes in the Anglican churches have gone too far.\nAnglican ordinariates.\nIn late 2009, in response to requests from various groups of Anglicans around the world who were dissatisfied with liberalizing movements within the Anglican Communion, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; issued the &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20constitution\"&gt;apostolic constitution&lt;/a&gt; \"Anglicanorum Coetibus\". This document invites groups of traditionalist Anglicans to form what are termed \"Anglican ordinariates\" or \"&lt;a href=\"personal%20ordinariate\"&gt;personal ordinariate&lt;/a&gt;s\" under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; in Rome, while preserving elements of the liturgical, musical, theological and other aspects of their Anglican patrimony. Under these terms, regional groupings of Anglican Catholics may apply for reception by the Holy See under the jurisdiction of an \"&lt;a href=\"Ordinary%20%28officer%29\"&gt;ordinary&lt;/a&gt;\" (i.e. a bishop or priest) appointed by Rome to oversee the community. While being in a country or region which is part of the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Church\"&gt;Latin Church&lt;/a&gt; of the Roman Catholic Church, these ordinaries will nonetheless retain aspects of the Anglican patrimony, such as married priests and traditional English choral music and liturgy. Because apostolic constitutions are the highest level of papal legislation and are not time-limited, the invitation is open into the indefinite future.\nSome have drawn parallels with the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;es. However, although there are some commonalities, Anglican ordinariates are part of the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Church\"&gt;Latin Church&lt;/a&gt; sui iuris within the Catholic Church, as they had been before the breach with Rome following the reign of Mary I of England, and their Anglican Use liturgy is a use (variation) of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Rite\"&gt;Roman Rite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first Anglican ordinariate, known as the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Ordinariate%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Walsingham\"&gt;Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham&lt;/a&gt;, was established on 15 January 2011 in the United Kingdom. The second Anglican ordinariate, known as the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Ordinariate%20of%20the%20Chair%20of%20Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter&lt;/a&gt;, was established on 1 January 2012 in the United States. The already existing &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Use\"&gt;Anglican Use&lt;/a&gt; parishes in the United States, which have existed since the 1980s, formed a portion of the first American Anglican ordinariate. These parishes were already in communion with Rome and use modified Anglican liturgies approved by the Holy See. They were joined by other groups and parishes of &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Episcopalians&lt;/a&gt; and some other Anglicans. A third Anglican ordinariate, known as the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Ordinariate%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Southern%20Cross\"&gt;Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross&lt;/a&gt;, was established on 15 June 2012 in Australia.\nPractices and beliefs.\nTheology.\nHistorically, Anglo-Catholics have valued \"highly the tradition of the early, undivided Church, they saw its authority as co-extensive with Scripture. They re-emphasized the Church's institutional history and form. Anglo-Catholicism was emotionally intense, and yet drawn to aspects of the pre-Reformation Church, including the revival of religious orders, the reintroduction of the language and symbolism of the eucharistic sacrifice,\" and \"the revival of private confession. Its spirituality was Evangelical, but High Church in content and form.\" At the same time, Anglo-Catholics held that \"the Roman Catholic has corrupted the original ritualism; and she [the Anglican Church] claims that the ritualism which she presents is a revival in purity of the original ritualism of the Catholic Church.\" The spirituality of Anglo-Catholics is drawn largely from the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"early%20Church\"&gt;early Church&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Divines\"&gt;Caroline Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Archbishop of Canterbury &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Parker\"&gt;Matthew Parker&lt;/a&gt;, in 1572, published \"De Antiquitate Britannic\u00e6 Ecclesi\u00e6\", which traced the roots of the Anglican Church, arguing \"that the early British Church differed from Roman Catholicism in key points and thus provided an alternative model for &lt;a href=\"patristic\"&gt;patristic&lt;/a&gt; Christianity,\" a view repeated by many Anglo-Catholics such as &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Chapman%20Grafton\"&gt;Charles Chapman Grafton&lt;/a&gt;, Bishop of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Fond%20du%20Lac\"&gt;Diocese of Fond du Lac&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Anglo-Catholics hold that the Anglican churches have maintained \"&lt;a href=\"Four%20Marks%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;catholicity and apostolicity&lt;/a&gt;.\" In the same vein, Anglo-Catholics emphasize the doctrines of &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20succession\"&gt;apostolic succession&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20ministry%23Threefold%20order\"&gt;threefold order&lt;/a&gt;, holding that these were retained by the Anglican Church after it went through the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodoxy\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;/a&gt;, Anglo-Catholics\u2014along with &lt;a href=\"Old-Catholic\"&gt;Old-Catholic&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014generally appeal to the \"canon\" (or rule) of &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20of%20Lerins\"&gt;St Vincent of Lerins&lt;/a&gt;: \"What everywhere, what always, and what by all has been believed, that is truly and properly Catholic.\"\nThe Anglican &lt;a href=\"Thirty-Nine%20Articles\"&gt;Thirty-Nine Articles&lt;/a&gt; make distinctions between Anglican and Roman Catholic understandings of doctrine; in the eyes of Anglo-Catholics, the Thirty-Nine Articles are &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, containing statements that profess the universal faith of the early Church. As the Articles were intentionally written in such a way as to be open to a range of interpretations, Anglo-Catholics have defended their practices and beliefs as being consistent with the Thirty-Nine Articles. A recent trend in Anglo-Catholic thought related to the Thirty-Nine Articles has included the &lt;a href=\"New%20Perspective%20on%20Paul\"&gt;New Perspective on Paul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnglo-Catholic priests often hear private &lt;a href=\"Confession%20%28religion%29\"&gt;confession&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick\"&gt;anoint the sick&lt;/a&gt;, regarding these practices as sacraments. The classic Anglican aphorism regarding private confession is: \"All may, some should, none must.\" Anglo-Catholics also offer prayers for the departed and the intercession of the saints; &lt;a href=\"C.%20S.%20Lewis\"&gt;C. S. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, often considered an Anglo-Catholic in his theological sensibilities, was once quoted as stating that,\nAnglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship also believe in the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist\"&gt;real objective presence&lt;/a&gt; of Christ in the Eucharist and understand the way He is manifest in the sacrament to be a &lt;a href=\"mystery%20of%20faith\"&gt;mystery of faith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20opposition%20to%20papal%20supremacy\"&gt;Like the Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and Lutherans, Anglo-Catholics, with the exception of the minority of &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Papalism\"&gt;Anglican Papalists&lt;/a&gt;, reject the Roman doctrines of the &lt;a href=\"papal%20supremacy\"&gt;papal supremacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"papal%20infallibility\"&gt;papal infallibility&lt;/a&gt;, with Walter Herbert Stowe, an Anglo-Catholic cleric, explaining the Anglican position on these issues:\n However, Anglo-Catholics share with Roman Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood and in the sacrificial character of the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt;. A minority of Anglo-Catholics also encourage priestly &lt;a href=\"clerical%20celibacy\"&gt;celibacy&lt;/a&gt;. Most Anglo-Catholics, due to the silence of The Thirty-Nine Articles on the issue, encourage devotion to the &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary\"&gt;Blessed Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, but not all Anglo-Catholics adhere to a high doctrine of &lt;a href=\"Mariology\"&gt;Mariology&lt;/a&gt;; in England, her title of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Walsingham\"&gt;Our Lady of Walsingham&lt;/a&gt; is popular.\nLiturgical practices.\nAnglo-Catholics are often identified by their liturgical practices and ornaments. These have traditionally been characterised by the \"six points\" of the later Catholic Revival's eucharistic practice:\nMany other traditional Catholic practices are observed within Anglo-Catholicism, including &lt;a href=\"eucharistic%20adoration\"&gt;eucharistic adoration&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these Anglo-Catholic \"innovations\" have since been accepted by &lt;a href=\"broad%20church\"&gt;broad church&lt;/a&gt; Anglicans, if not by Evangelical or &lt;a href=\"Low%20Church\"&gt;Low Church&lt;/a&gt; Anglicans.\nVarious liturgical strands exist within Anglo-Catholicism:\nPreferences for Elizabethan English and modern English texts vary within the movement.\nIn the United States a group of Anglo-Catholics at the Episcopal &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Good%20Shepherd%20%28Rosemont%2C%20Pennsylvania%29\"&gt;Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania)&lt;/a&gt; published, under the rubrics of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, the \"&lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Service%20Book\"&gt;Anglican Service Book&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"a traditional-language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and additional devotions.\" This book is based on the 1979 Book of Common Prayer but includes offices and devotions in the traditional language of the 1928 Prayer Book that are not in the 1979 edition. The book also draws from sources such as the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Missal\"&gt;Anglican Missal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn many Anglo-Catholic churches, clergy are referred to as Father, and in places where the priestly ministry of women is accepted, Mother."
