    "text": "Jacques Fesch (April 6, 1930, &lt;a href=\"Saint-Germain-en-Laye\"&gt;Saint-Germain-en-Laye&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 October 1, 1957, &lt;a href=\"La%20Sant%C3%A9%20Prison\"&gt;La Sant\u00e9 Prison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;) was the &lt;a href=\"murder\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;er of a &lt;a href=\"French%20National%20Police\"&gt;French police officer&lt;/a&gt;, who became such a devout &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; while in prison awaiting &lt;a href=\"capital%20punishment\"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; that he has been proposed for beatification.\nEarly life.\nFesch's father was a wealthy banker of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; origin, an artist and &lt;a href=\"atheist\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;, distant from his son. Jacques was a young aimless dreamer. Brought up a Roman Catholic, he abandoned religion by the age of 17, after his parents divorced. He was expelled from school for laziness and misconduct. At 21, he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a &lt;a href=\"civil%20marriage\"&gt;civil ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. He gave up a position at his father's bank, lived the life of a playboy, left his wife and their daughter, and fathered an &lt;a href=\"illegitimacy\"&gt;illegitimate&lt;/a&gt; son with another woman. Disillusioned with his life, he dreamed of escaping to sail around the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;South Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, but his parents refused to pay for a boat.\nCrime.\nOn 24 February 1954, to fund the purchase of a boat, he went to rob Alexandre Silberstein, a &lt;a href=\"bureau%20de%20change\"&gt;money changer&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"gold%20coin\"&gt;gold coin&lt;/a&gt;s. Silberstein was struck but not unconscious, and raised the alarm. Fesch fled, losing his &lt;a href=\"eyeglasses\"&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and shot wildly at Jean Vergne, a pursuing police officer, killing him. Minutes later he was arrested. Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion, inflamed by newspaper reports, was strongly in favour of his execution. The &lt;a href=\"Cour%20d%27assises\"&gt;Cour d'assises&lt;/a&gt; of Paris condemned him to death on 6 April 1957.\nReligious conversion.\nAt first Fesch was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer's Catholic faith whom he nicknamed : \"the panther of God\". However, after a year in prison, he experienced a profound religious conversion, became very pious, and bitterly regretted his crime. He corresponded regularly with his family, notably his brother and stepmother, and kept a spiritual &lt;a href=\"personal%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution. His last journal entry was \"In five hours, I will see &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;!\". An appeal for &lt;a href=\"clemency\"&gt;clemency&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20France\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Coty\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Coty&lt;/a&gt; failed, and he was &lt;a href=\"guillotine\"&gt;guillotine&lt;/a&gt;d.\nLegacy.\nAfter his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of &lt;a href=\"Redemption%20%28theology%29\"&gt;redemption&lt;/a&gt;. At first he was excoriated by the public, but with the work of Soeur V\u00e9ronique, a &lt;a href=\"Carmelite\"&gt;Carmelite&lt;/a&gt; nun, and Father Augustin-Michel Lemonnier, the family effected publication of his writings, and from the 1970s these served as an inspiration to many.\nOn September 21, 1987 the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Archbishop of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Jean-Marie%20Lustiger\"&gt;Jean-Marie Lustiger&lt;/a&gt;, opened a diocesan inquiry into his life; the cause for his &lt;a href=\"beatification\"&gt;beatification&lt;/a&gt; was formally opened in 1993. This has proved controversial, with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion.\nHis writings have often been quoted in Catholic publications. His personal journal and letters to his mother and brother are often about mystical or theological matters.\nTheatrical plays about Fesch.\nThe story of Jacques Fesch remains relatively unknown in France. However, inspired by the true events of this \"murderer turned Christian,\" the students of &lt;a href=\"Gymn%C3%A1zium%20sv.%20Cyrila%20a%20Metoda\"&gt;Ss Cyril and Method High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, under the direction of Maria Marthe Galov\u00e1, wrote and performed a theatrical play, \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//spomensinamna.gcm.sk/\"&gt;Spome\u0148 si na m\u0148a&lt;/a&gt;\" (Remember Me), which is based on the life and conversion of Jacques.The play premiered on March 11, 2018, in the &lt;a href=\"Andrej%20Bagar%20Theatre\"&gt;Andrej Bagar Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nitra\"&gt;Nitra&lt;/a&gt;."
