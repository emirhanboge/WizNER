An accompanying music video for the lead single \"Not By the Moon\" was released in conjunction with the release of the album. The video makes references to themes of \"royalty\", \"astronomy\", \"mystical motifs\" and \"magic\" as the band clad in white perform \"complex choreography\". It was heavily inspired by English playwright and poet &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s romantic tragedy \"&lt;a href=\"Romeo%20and%20Juliet\"&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;\".\nComposition.\n\"Dye\" consists of six songs while the physical version contains four additional bonus tracks. The EP's title is a &lt;a href=\"pun\"&gt;pun&lt;/a&gt; on the word \"dye\" which refers to both colour and death as they relate to \"eternal love\". According to Got7, the album \"epitomizes a permanent pledge of love\" that sonically follows their 2019 EP \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20My%20Name%20%28EP%29\"&gt;Call My Name&lt;/a&gt;\" \"but is more mournful and powerful.\" The album opens with the \"dreamy\" number \"Aura\" written by &lt;a href=\"Choi%20Young-jae\"&gt;Young-jae&lt;/a&gt;. The lead single, \"Not By the Moon\" is a &lt;a href=\"trap%20%28music%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"synth-pop\"&gt;synth-pop&lt;/a&gt; song, produced and written by JYP Entertainment's CEO &lt;a href=\"J.%20Y.%20Park\"&gt;Park Jin-young&lt;/a&gt; (J.Y. Park), with the collaboration with renowned songwriter duo Jakob Mihoubi and Rudy Daouk. It sets a darker tone for the EP and incorporates a \"heaviness\" in its production. It also features high tones and harmonies. \"Love You Better\" is a &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; song with a &lt;a href=\"synth-pop\"&gt;synth-pop&lt;/a&gt; chorus and was written by Got7's &lt;a href=\"Park%20Jin-young%20%28entertainer%2C%20born%201994%29\"&gt;Jin-young&lt;/a&gt;. \"Crazy\" is built on &lt;a href=\"future%20bass\"&gt;future bass&lt;/a&gt; and contains an \"addictive\" melody written by JB. It features \"high-&lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synth&lt;/a&gt; smatterings\" over \"hard-hitting &lt;a href=\"bass%20drum\"&gt;bass drum&lt;/a&gt; pattern.\" \"Trust My Love\" is a hybrid of &lt;a href=\"reggaeton\"&gt;reggaeton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"house%20%28music%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; with elements of &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; for which \"intense\" drum beats and &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;EDM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; provide minimalist &lt;a href=\"instrumental\"&gt;instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;. \"Poison\" features an actual whistle and was written by &lt;a href=\"Yugyeom\"&gt;Yugyeom&lt;/a&gt;. The last four tracks \"Ride\", \"Gravity\", \"God Has Return + Ma\u00f1ana\" and \"JY&amp;YG Dance\" were performed by the band on the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Got7%20concert%20tours%23%26quot%3BKEEP%20SPINNING%26quot%3B%202019%20World%20Tour\"&gt;2019 Keep Spinning World Tour&lt;/a&gt; and are only available on the CD version of the album.\nPromotion.\nOn April 25, 2020, Got7 held an online showcase which was broadcast live via &lt;a href=\"Naver%20%28corporation%29\"&gt;Naver&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"V%20Live%20%28website%29\"&gt;V Live&lt;/a&gt; app. They performed \"Aura\", \"Not By the Moon\", \"Love You Better\" and \"Poison\" for the first time at the showcase.

He wrote: \"Whether it\u2019s the brash synth-bass parts, the dense synth layers, or their undeniably silky hooks that weave their way in between the music, each component creates its own journey, without pulling away from the song\u2019s nature.\"\nCommercial performance.\nThe album debuted atop the &lt;a href=\"Gaon%20Album%20Chart\"&gt;Gaon Album Chart&lt;/a&gt;, selling 280,000 physical copies in its first week.
