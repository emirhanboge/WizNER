    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"2021%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2021 season&lt;/a&gt; was the 90th season for the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Football%20Team\"&gt;Washington Football Team&lt;/a&gt; and their second under &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Washington%20Football%20Team%20head%20coaches\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Rivera\"&gt;Ron Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. Some additions and changes include the team hiring &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Mayhew\"&gt;Martin Mayhew&lt;/a&gt; as general manager and &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Hurney\"&gt;Marty Hurney&lt;/a&gt; as another high-ranking executive. With the hiring of Mayhew, who is &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, Washington became the first team in NFL history to concurrently have a minority general manager, head coach, and team president. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Kerrigan\"&gt;Ryan Kerrigan&lt;/a&gt;, the franchise's all-time sack leader, was not retained before becoming a free agent in the offseason and later signed with the division rival &lt;a href=\"2021%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWashington failed to improve upon their &lt;a href=\"2020%20Washington%20Football%20Team%20season\"&gt;7\u20139 record&lt;/a&gt; from the previous season, failed to repeat as division champions, and missed the playoffs for the fifth time in their past six seasons after a Week 17 home loss to Philadelphia. Washington was also the first team since the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;1995 Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; to have their final five games of the season be within the division. This season was also the last under the transitionary \"Football Team\" moniker.\nDraft.\nNotes\nSchedule.\nPreseason.\nThe preseason was reduced from four games to three with the regular season expanding to 17.\nRegular season.\nNote: Intra-division opponents are in bold text.\nGame summaries.\nWeek 2: vs. New York Giants.\nA back and forth shootout, Washington capitalized on a late opportunity to escape with a 30-29 win. After Washington took a 14-10 lead into halftime, the Giants scored on their first 4 possessions of the second half to take a 26-20 lead. Washington answered back with a touchdown from Heinicke to Ricky Seals-Jones to take a 27-26 lead, but the Giants capitalized on a late Heinicke interception to take a 29-27 lead. After Washington got into field goal range, Dustin Hopkins missed a 48-yard field goal to win the game. However, the Giants were offside, which nullified the miss and gave Washington one untimed down, since a game cannot end on a defensive penalty. Hopkins made his second attempt from 43 yards to give Washington the win. This was Washington's first win over the Giants since Week 8 of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;2018 season&lt;/a&gt;, and improved their record to 1-1 on the season.\nWeek 3: at Buffalo Bills.\nBuffalo got out to a 21-0 lead early, and Washington was never able to fully recover in a 43-21 loss. Josh Allen threw for 358 yards and four touchdowns, and ran for another in the fourth to give Buffalo a 43-14 lead. The 43 points allowed were the most points Washington has allowed under Ron Rivera, and were the most points they had allowed since week 17 of the 2019 season against the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;. Washington dropped to 1-2 on the season.\nWeek 4: at Atlanta Falcons.\nWashington was able to recover from an early 10-0 deficit to defeat the Falcons 34-30 behind 290 yards and 3 touchdowns from Taylor Heinicke. After the 10-0 deficit, Washington scored two touchdowns in the second to take a 13-10 lead. After the Falcons took a 17-13 lead into half, DeAndre Carter returned the second half kickoff 101 yards to give the lead back to Washington. The Falcons took back the lead and then extended it to 30-22 early in the fourth, but Heinicke threw two touchdowns in the final four minutes to give Washington the win. The win improved Washington to 2-2 on the season, and 2-0 in the conference.\nWeek 5: vs. New Orleans Saints.\nWashington suffered an 11-point loss to the New Orleans Saints.\ufffc\nWeek 10: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn a rematch of their Wild Card matchup from the previous season, Washington upset the Buccaneers 29-19 to end their four-game losing streak. Tom Brady threw two interceptions in the first quarter, which Washington turned into 10 points to take a 13-0 lead early in the second. Tampa cut the lead to 23-19 early in the fourth, but Washington sealed the game with a 10 minute, 19-play touchdown drive. With the win, Washington improved to 3-6 on the season.\nWeek 11: at Carolina Panthers.\nBoth teams traded a pair of touchdowns in the first half, with Newton throwing for a touchdown while rushing for another while Taylor Heinicke threw for two touchdowns. Washington took their first lead in the third quarter with Heinicke's throwing a touchdown to DeAndre Carter. After the Panthers tied it early in the fourth quarter, Washington got back-to-back field goals from Joey Slye. The Panthers' last shot to win the game was denied when &lt;a href=\"Cam%20Newton\"&gt;Cam Newton&lt;/a&gt; got sacked on fourth down. With the win, Washington won back-to-back games for the first time in the season and improved to 4-6.\nWeek 16: at Dallas Cowboys.\nWashington allowed their most points to the Cowboys in franchise history in giving up 56. The loss dropped Washington to 6\u20139.\nWeek 17: vs. Philadelphia Eagles.\nFor the first time since 2019 and fourth time in five seasons, Washington was swept by the Eagles. Despite leading through three quarters, Washington could not withstand a second-half rally by Philadelphia, and a late rally of their own was snuffed out by a game ending interception. Washington was eliminated from playoff contention with the 20\u201316 loss.\nWeek 18: at New York Giants.\nPrior to the game, the organization announced they would be unveiling the new team name on February 2, 2022, making this the final game the franchise played as the Washington Football Team. With the win, Washington swept the Giants for the first time since 2011."
