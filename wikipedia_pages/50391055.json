On the occasion of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; attack, when his battalion was in reserve, he moved it up to resist the attack and held on to the position for two days, though the troops on his flank were pressed back. His steadfast determination to hold his ground against repeated attacks and under heavy fire largely contributed to restoring and keeping in hand the critical situation which had arisen\". Morgan-Owen was wounded and gassed during the war and an injury to his arm resulted in the end of his sporting career.\nHonours.\nCorinthian\nCasuals\nWales"
