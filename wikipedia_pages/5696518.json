    "text": "Augustine Henry (2 July 1857 \u2013 23 March 1930) was a British-born Irish &lt;a href=\"plantsman\"&gt;plantsman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sinologist\"&gt;sinologist&lt;/a&gt;. He is best known for sending over 15,000 dry &lt;a href=\"Biological%20specimen\"&gt;specimen&lt;/a&gt;s and seeds and 500 plant samples to &lt;a href=\"Kew%20Gardens\"&gt;Kew Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. By 1930, he was a recognised authority and was honoured with society membership in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, France, and &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1929 the Botanical Institute of Peking dedicated to him the second volume of \"Icones plantarum Sinicarum\", a collection of plant drawings. In 1935, \"John William Besant\" was to write: 'The wealth of beautiful trees and flowering shrubs which adorn gardens in all temperate parts of the world today is due in a great measure to the pioneer work of the late Professor Henry'.\nEarly life and education.\nHenry was born on 2 July 1857 in &lt;a href=\"Dundee\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to Bernard (a &lt;a href=\"flax\"&gt;flax&lt;/a&gt; merchant) and Mary (n\u00e9e McManee) Henry; the family returned to &lt;a href=\"Cookstown\"&gt;Cookstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Co.%20Tyrone\"&gt;Co. Tyrone&lt;/a&gt;, shortly afterwards. Educated at Cookstown Academy and later &lt;a href=\"Queens%20College%20Galway\"&gt;Queens College Galway&lt;/a&gt; (B.A.), &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20University%20Belfast\"&gt;Queens College, Belfast&lt;/a&gt; (M.A.) 1879 to study medicine, Henry transferred his studies to &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; to finish his degree sooner and duly qualified as a doctor. At some stage, he came in contact with &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Robert%20Hart\"&gt;Sir Robert Hart&lt;/a&gt; who encouraged him to join the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Maritime%20Customs%20Service\"&gt;Imperial Customs Service&lt;/a&gt; in China.\nHenry entered the Imperial Customs Service in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; in 1881 as Assistant Medical Officer and Customs Assistant. He was sent to the remote posting of &lt;a href=\"Yichang\"&gt;Yichang&lt;/a&gt; (Ichanh) in 1882 in &lt;a href=\"Hubei\"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt; Province, Central China, to investigate plants used in &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20medicine\"&gt;Chinese medicine&lt;/a&gt;. He also served in &lt;a href=\"Hupeh\"&gt;Hupeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Szechuan\"&gt;Szechuan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Simao%20District\"&gt;Simao&lt;/a&gt; (Yunnan), &lt;a href=\"Mengsi\"&gt;Mengsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Formosa\"&gt;Formosa&lt;/a&gt; (Taiwan). Later in his Chinese career he studied Law and became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Temple\"&gt;Middle Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Henry had studied Chinese before going to China and gained a great proficiency in the language. Henry retired with the rank of &lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlantsman career.\nWhile at Yichang and in other parts of China he collected plants, seeds and specimens, many of which had not been known until then. In 1888 he published a list of Chinese plants for the Journal of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Asiatic%20Society\"&gt;Royal Asiatic Society&lt;/a&gt;. At that time the &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; of China was not well known. By 1896, 25 new &lt;a href=\"Genus\"&gt;genera&lt;/a&gt; and 500 new species had been identified from his specimens. Henry sent over 15,000 dry &lt;a href=\"Biological%20specimen\"&gt;specimen&lt;/a&gt;s and seed to &lt;a href=\"Kew%20Gardens\"&gt;Kew Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and 500 plant samples; many of these later became well known garden plants\nHe named 19 of them, including \"&lt;a href=\"Aconitum\"&gt;Aconitum&lt;/a&gt; hemsleyanum\" after William Botting Hemsley of Kew.\nHenry gave instructions to the plant collector Ernest Wilson on where to collect \"&lt;a href=\"Davidia%20involucrata\"&gt;Davidia involucrata&lt;/a&gt;\", originally discovered by the French missionary priest P\u00e8re &lt;a href=\"Armand%20David\"&gt;Armand David&lt;/a&gt;. On his return to Europe he spent some time working on his own introductions at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew\"&gt;Royal Botanic Garden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kew\"&gt;Kew&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1900, Henry went to France to study at the &lt;a href=\"French%20National%20School%20of%20Forestry\"&gt;French National School of Forestry&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nancy%2C%20France\"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;. He later became joint author with &lt;a href=\"Henry%20John%20Elwes\"&gt;Henry John Elwes&lt;/a&gt; of the 7 volume \"Trees of Great Britain and Ireland\" 1907\u201313. His contribution here was unique insofar as he devised a system of identification based on leaves and twigs and on the position of buds to aid identification even in the absence of fruit and flowers. He was involved in the establishment of the Chair of Forestry at &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University\"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt; in 1907, and remained there until 1913. He was responsible, with A.C. Forbes, the Director of Forestry at the Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction, for the lay-out of plots of trees at &lt;a href=\"Avondale%2C%20County%20Wicklow\"&gt;Avondale, County Wicklow&lt;/a&gt;.\nCeltic Revival.\nHenry had an interest in the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement\"&gt;Arts and Crafts movement&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Revival\"&gt;Celtic Revival&lt;/a&gt;. He knew the poet &lt;a href=\"W.B.%20Yeats\"&gt;W.B. Yeats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20William%20Russell\"&gt;George William Russell&lt;/a&gt; (AE), &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Payne-Townshend\"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"George%20Bernard%20Shaw\"&gt;George Bernard Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and was acquainted with the families of Sir &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Casement\"&gt;Roger Casement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erskine%20Childers%20%28author%29\"&gt;Erskine Childers&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoyal College of Science, Dublin.\nHe took up the Chair of Forestry at the Royal College of Science (later &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20Dublin\"&gt;University College Dublin&lt;/a&gt;), in 1913 and assisted later in setting up a National Forestry Service.\nPrivate life.\nHenry married Alice Brunton in 1908; they did not have children.\nPlants named after Augustine Henry.\nThe following plants are named after Augustine Henry:"
