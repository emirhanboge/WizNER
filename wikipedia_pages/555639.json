    "text": "The Enid are a British &lt;a href=\"progressive%20rock\"&gt;progressive rock&lt;/a&gt; band founded by keyboardist and composer &lt;a href=\"Robert%20John%20Godfrey\"&gt;Robert John Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;. Godfrey received his main musical education from The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt;. He is previously known for his work with &lt;a href=\"Barclay%20James%20Harvest\"&gt;Barclay James Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, and as a recording artist on the &lt;a href=\"Charisma%20Records\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; label. In 2014, he won the &lt;a href=\"Prog%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Visionary Award&lt;/a&gt; (Progressive Music Awards) for establishing an early fan based crowdfunding model to finance the band named The Stand.\nIn 1973, Godfrey, together with friends &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Lickerish\"&gt;Francis Lickerish&lt;/a&gt;, Stephen Stewart and David Williams founded The Enid. They had all met at the famous experimental educational establishment, &lt;a href=\"Finchden%20Manor\"&gt;Finchden Manor&lt;/a&gt;. In 1974, they were joined by Dave Storey and Glen Tollet.\nMembership Structure\nOne unusual feature of the agreed terms of membership of the band was that any member wanting to leave could elect to depart unencumbered on the condition that they gave up all rights in the band\u2019s future. Because the band always carried liabilities of some sort, no member leaving has ever decided on any other course prior to 1987.\nEthos.\n\"We may not be the best band in the world - not even one of the best but we are very different\", says Godfrey.\nThe Enid continues to be a misfit Art-Rock band trying to be Mahler with electric guitars and drums. Politically and socially driven with a strong interest in experimental theology, their mission remains to push the boundaries between rock music and the power and expression of symphonic classical music.\nHistory.\nThe Enid began recording at about the same time as &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt; burst upon the music scene. Godfrey has said that he always regarded The Enid's ironic takes on &lt;a href=\"European%20classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; as being just as anarchic as anything by the &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt;, but this did not translate into either musical or commercial recognition, despite their work being played frequently by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vance\"&gt;Tommy Vance&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%20One\"&gt;BBC Radio One&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Friday Rock Show\". However, unique among progressive rock bands, the Enid secured a fan base which significantly overlapped with the punk rock fan base. Thanks largely to their quirky appearance and stage act, they built a sizable campus following even while under the shadow of the punk movement.\nEarly albums were entirely instrumental due to the suicide of founding vocalist Peter Roberts on New Year's Day 1975, shortly before rehearsals for the band's debut album \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Region%20of%20the%20Summer%20Stars\"&gt;In the Region of the Summer Stars&lt;/a&gt;\"; the band considered Roberts to be irreplaceable.\nThe band's record label, &lt;a href=\"Pye%20Records\"&gt;Pye Records&lt;/a&gt;, folded on the eve of releasing a double compilation album, \"Rhapsody in Rock\", leaving the Enid with substantial bills and no income to cover them. Only continued touring kept the band afloat. In 1981, the Enid were &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Wilde\"&gt;Kim Wilde&lt;/a&gt;'s backing band on her &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Wilde%20%28album%29\"&gt;self-titled debut album&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to Godfrey, because the album was recorded in the Enid's studio, they were paid only \"a pittance\" for their work on it. During this period founding member &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Lickerish\"&gt;Francis Lickerish&lt;/a&gt; was ousted from the Enid following a failed attempt to take leadership of the group from Godfrey.\nThe band's fifth album, \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\", released in 1983, was the first Enid album to feature lyrics, which were written by then-drummer Chris North and sung in a mock-&lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic style by Godfrey. The release was a concept album dealing with the threat of &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20warfare\"&gt;nuclear warfare&lt;/a&gt; and the various ways in which people respond to it.\nThe Enid released no full-length albums between 1997 and 2010, when \"Journey's End\" was released, although 2009's \"Arise and Shine\" featured newly remixed and partly re-recorded tracks from previous albums plus one preview of a \"Journey's End\" track.\nIn December 2012, the band's thirteenth album \"&lt;a href=\"Invicta%20%28The%20Enid%20album%29\"&gt;Invicta&lt;/a&gt;\" was voted 9th in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\"'s \"Readers' albums of 2012\" poll, with \"The One and the Many\" placed 6th in the \"Readers' tracks of 2012\" category.\nIn June 2013, it was revealed that the band's sole remaining founding member Robert John Godfrey had been diagnosed with early &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, and that as a result he was retiring from the band. The band opted to continue, with Godfrey's consent, following his departure. The ownership and trade mark of the band name was transferred to Jason Ducker. \nKeyboardist &lt;a href=\"William%20Gilmour%20%28musician%29\"&gt;William Gilmour&lt;/a&gt; founded a new band, Craft, after leaving The Enid, along with Grant McKay Gilmour and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Russell\"&gt;Martin Russell&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Afro%20Celt%20Sound%20System\"&gt;Afro Celt Sound System&lt;/a&gt;. The band produced a self-titled mini-album in 1984 featuring Enid-style instrumentals based on six signs of the &lt;a href=\"zodiac\"&gt;zodiac&lt;/a&gt;: \"Aries\", \"Taurus\", \"Gemini\", \"Cancer\", \"Leo\", and \"Virgo\". The album was released on CD on the American label Kinetic Discs in 1992. The CD added two short bonus tracks, \"Branislana\" and \"And So to Sleep\", which were, if anything, even more heavily influenced by The Enid.\nIn March 2016 Godfrey revealed that he would be retiring from touring, with keyboardist Zach Bullock and vocalist Joe Payne covering all aspects of Godfrey's performance; with the line-up for the following tour consisting of Bullock, Payne, guitarists Jason Ducker and Max Read, drummer Dave Storey, and new bassist Josh Judd. It was revealed the following month that Godfrey was in fact permanently retiring from the band in an official capacity.\nOn 5 September 2016 it was announced that Payne had departed the band after five years as frontman; and three days later it was revealed that guitarist Read and Storey had also decided to leave The Enid, and that the band now consisted of Bullock, Ducker, and returning multi-instrumentalist Dominic Tofield.\nIn April 2018 Godfrey announced his return to the band. A brain scan intended to determine the progress of his Alzheimer's disease showed no presence of Alzheimer's at all. In January 2020, The Enid consisted of two members, Godfrey and Ducker, and they were working on the new album \"U\", which earlier was intended to be released as a Godfrey solo album called Homily.\nMarketing innovations.\nIn addition to traditional vinyl and CD releases, in the late 1990s the band pioneered the production of \"Bespoke CDs\" \u2013 mail-order custom compilation &lt;a href=\"CD-R\"&gt;CD-R&lt;/a&gt;s containing rare tracks chosen by listeners from a catalogue. This service was discontinued after a couple of years.\nIn the 2001 the band formed a marketing agreement with Inner Sanctum that saw most of the band's back-catalogue being reissued on that label. However, in 2009 they announced that Inner Sanctum was illegally attempting to take control of the band's name and copyrights. As a result of the ensuing legal action the \"Journey's End\" album was released on the band's own Enidiworks/Operation Seraphim label. The Enid stated that in 2010 Inner Sanctum released illegal bootlegs of the original EMI versions of \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Region%20of%20the%20Summer%20Stars\"&gt;In the Region of the Summer Stars&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Faerie%20Nonsense\"&gt;Aerie Faerie Nonsense&lt;/a&gt;\". As a result of this EMI took action against Gerald Palmer to stop the bootlegs and agreed to grant a worldwide license to Operation Seraphim (the band's own record label) for the three albums EMI owns (\"In The Region\", \"Aerie Faerie Nonsense\", and Godfrey's 1974 solo album \"The Fall of Hyperion\").\nIn March 2006 Godfrey announced on the band's website that he would be making its entire back catalogue available for free &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; as high-quality &lt;a href=\"mp3\"&gt;mp3&lt;/a&gt;s. Godfrey wrote: \"The purpose of this is to make sure that The Enid's music reaches as many people as possible and does not entirely disappear when I am dead. The Enid represents my life's work and I want it and what it contains to live on in those who warm to it. Having taken this decision it may well influence the way I think about The Enid and may drive me to do some more.\""
