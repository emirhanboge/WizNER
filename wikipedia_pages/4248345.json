    "text": "HNoMS \"Sleipner\" was a 1. class &lt;a href=\"gunboat\"&gt;gunboat&lt;/a&gt; built for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Like all other &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Royal%20Norwegian%20Navy%20ships%23Gunships\"&gt;Norwegian gunships&lt;/a&gt; of her era, she carried a heavy armament on a diminutive hull. The vessel was built at the Naval Yard at Horten, and had yard number 56.\nFitout.\n\"Sleipner\"'s main weapon was a 26 cm (10-inch) cannon, of the same make and model other navies mounted on &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Sleipner\" also carried an underwater &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt; in her bow for firing &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Whitehead\"&gt;Whitehead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, and she was the first vessel in the Royal Norwegian Navy equipped with this weapon.\nRebuild.\nIn 1900 \"Sleipner\" was rebuilt, and her masts and rigging removed. After her rebuild she was used as a &lt;a href=\"cadet\"&gt;cadet&lt;/a&gt; ship (training vessel) until 1915, when she started a new life as a floating &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1921 and 1932 \"Sleipner\" was used as a floating &lt;a href=\"Distribution%20center\"&gt;depot&lt;/a&gt; for the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Navy%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service&lt;/a&gt;, before she was finally decommissioned and scrapped in 1935."
