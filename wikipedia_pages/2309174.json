    "text": "\"All Things Must Pass\" is a song by English rock musician &lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison\"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, issued in November 1970 as the title track to his &lt;a href=\"All%20Things%20Must%20Pass\"&gt;triple album of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Preston\"&gt;Billy Preston&lt;/a&gt; released the song originally \u2013 as \"All Things (Must) Pass\" \u2013 on his &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Records\"&gt;Apple Records&lt;/a&gt; album \"&lt;a href=\"Encouraging%20Words\"&gt;Encouraging Words&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970) after &lt;a href=\"the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt; had rehearsed the song in January 1969 but overlooked it for inclusion on their \"&lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Be%20%28Beatles%20album%29\"&gt;Let It Be&lt;/a&gt;\" album. The composition reflects the influence of &lt;a href=\"the%20Band\"&gt;the Band&lt;/a&gt;'s sound and communal music-making on Harrison, after he had spent time with the group in &lt;a href=\"Woodstock%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Woodstock, New York&lt;/a&gt;, in late 1968. In his lyrics, Harrison drew inspiration from &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Leary\"&gt;Timothy Leary&lt;/a&gt;'s poem \"All Things Pass\", a &lt;a href=\"Psychedelia\"&gt;psychedelic&lt;/a&gt; adaptation of the \"&lt;a href=\"Tao%20Te%20Ching\"&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe subject matter deals with the transient nature of human existence, and in Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" reading, words and music combine to reflect impressions of optimism against fatalism. On release, together with &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Feinstein\"&gt;Barry Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;'s album cover image, commentators viewed the song as a statement on &lt;a href=\"break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles' break-up&lt;/a&gt;. Widely regarded as one of Harrison's finest compositions, its passing on by his former band has provoked comment from biographers and reviewers. Music critic &lt;a href=\"Ian%20MacDonald\"&gt;Ian MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles\", while author Simon Leng considers it \"perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition\". The recording was co-produced by &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Spector\"&gt;Phil Spector&lt;/a&gt; in London; it features an orchestral arrangement by &lt;a href=\"John%20Barham\"&gt;John Barham&lt;/a&gt; and contributions from musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Starr\"&gt;Ringo Starr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Drake\"&gt;Pete Drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Whitlock\"&gt;Bobby Whitlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Clapton\"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Voormann\"&gt;Klaus Voormann&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Beatles failed to formally record the song, a 1969 solo &lt;a href=\"demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; by Harrison appears on their compilation \"&lt;a href=\"Anthology%203\"&gt;Anthology 3&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996). An early version from the \"All Things Must Pass\" sessions was released on Harrison's posthumous compilation \"\" in 2012. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McCartney\"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; performed \"All Things Must Pass\" at the &lt;a href=\"Concert%20for%20George\"&gt;Concert for George&lt;/a&gt; tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. &lt;a href=\"Jim%20James\"&gt;Jim James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Waterboys\"&gt;the Waterboys&lt;/a&gt;, Klaus Voormann and &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Islam\"&gt;Yusuf Islam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sloan%20Wainwright\"&gt;Sloan Wainwright&lt;/a&gt; are among the other artists who have covered the song.\nBackground.\nLike his friend &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Clapton\"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison\"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; was inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20from%20Big%20Pink\"&gt;Music from Big Pink&lt;/a&gt;\", the seminal debut album from &lt;a href=\"the%20Band\"&gt;the Band&lt;/a&gt;, the former backing group for &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Dylan\"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt;. Released in July 1968, \"Music from Big Pink\" was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument, after he had spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian &lt;a href=\"sitar\"&gt;sitar&lt;/a&gt;. Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring \"Big Pink\" \"\"the\" new sound to come from America\", drummer &lt;a href=\"Levon%20Helm\"&gt;Levon Helm&lt;/a&gt; later recalled, thus helping to establish the Band internationally. In appreciation, &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Robertson\"&gt;Robbie Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, the Band's guitarist, extended an invitation to Harrison to stop by in &lt;a href=\"Woodstock%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Woodstock, New York&lt;/a&gt;, when the opportunity arose.\nLate in 1968, after producing sessions in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Is%20This%20What%20You%20Want%3F\"&gt;solo album&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Records\"&gt;Apple Records&lt;/a&gt; signing &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Lomax\"&gt;Jackie Lomax&lt;/a&gt;, Harrison spent &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving\"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; and much of December in upstate &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in informal &lt;a href=\"jam%20session\"&gt;jam session&lt;/a&gt;s with the Band. According to Helm, they discussed making a possible \"fireside jam\" album with Clapton and an &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Films\"&gt;Apple Films&lt;/a&gt; \"rock &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"Zachariah\", but neither project progressed beyond the planning stage. The bucolic surroundings proved fruitful for Harrison as a songwriter, producing his first collaboration with Dylan, \"&lt;a href=\"I%27d%20Have%20You%20Anytime\"&gt;I'd Have You Anytime&lt;/a&gt;\", and leading him to write \"All Things Must Pass\". He later described the latter song as a \"Robbie Robertson\u2013Band type of tune\", and said that he always imagined it being sung by Helm.\nComposition.\nWhile discussing \"All Things Must Pass\" with music journalist &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20White%20%28editor%29\"&gt;Timothy White&lt;/a&gt; in 1987, Harrison recalled that his \"starting point\" for the composition was Robertson's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight\"&gt;The Weight&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 a song that had \"a religious \"and\" a country feeling to it\".&lt;ref name=\"White/Musician\"&gt;Timothy White, \"George Harrison \u2013 Reconsidered\", \"&lt;a href=\"Musician%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Musician&lt;/a&gt;\", November 1987, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Musically, the verses of \"All Things Must Pass\" are set to a logical climb within the &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28music%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; of E; the brief &lt;a href=\"refrain\"&gt;choruses&lt;/a&gt; form a departure from this, with their inclusion of a B &lt;a href=\"minor%20chord\"&gt;minor chord&lt;/a&gt; rather than the more expected major &lt;a href=\"voicing%20%28music%29\"&gt;voicing&lt;/a&gt;. Author Ian Inglis notes that the composition incorporates the same \"&lt;a href=\"Mode%20%28music%29\"&gt;modes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cadence%20%28music%29\"&gt;cadences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nonchord%20tone%23Suspension\"&gt;suspensions&lt;/a&gt;\" found in Band songs such as \"The Weight\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20They%20Drove%20Old%20Dixie%20Down\"&gt;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFor his lyrics, Harrison drew inspiration from \"All Things Pass\", a poem published in &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Leary\"&gt;Timothy Leary&lt;/a&gt;'s 1966 book \"Psychedelic Prayers after the &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Te%20Ching\"&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;\". In his 1980 autobiography, \"&lt;a href=\"I%2C%20Me%2C%20Mine%20%28book%29\"&gt;I Me Mine&lt;/a&gt;\", Harrison refers to the idea for the song originating from \"all kinds of mystics and ex-mystics\", including Leary. Like later Harrison compositions such as \"&lt;a href=\"Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"So%20Sad\"&gt;So Sad&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Blow%20Away\"&gt;Blow Away&lt;/a&gt;\", the lyrical and emotional content is based around metaphors involving the weather and the cycle of nature. Harrison states in the opening lines of verse one: \"Sunrise doesn't last all morning / A cloudburst doesn't last all day\".\nAccording to Harrison biographer Simon Leng, the lyrics reflect \"life's ephemeral character\" and the \"transitory\" nature of love. Inglis suggests that the song is \"[o]stensibly\" about \"the end of a love affair\". He and theologian &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Allison\"&gt;Dale Allison&lt;/a&gt; note the optimism offered in Harrison's words, since, as Leng puts it, \"a new day always dawns.\" Although \"All Things Must Pass\" avoids &lt;a href=\"religiosity\"&gt;religiosity&lt;/a&gt;, Allison writes that its statement on the \"all-inclusive\" transience of things in the material world explains why so much of its 1970 parent album, \"&lt;a href=\"All%20Things%20Must%20Pass\"&gt;All Things Must Pass&lt;/a&gt;\", \"finds hope and meaning only in God, who does not pass away\". The song's main message is offered in its &lt;a href=\"Thirty-two-bar%20form%23Middle%20eight\"&gt;middle eight&lt;/a&gt;:\nUltimately, the cycle of nature offers \"consolation\", Leng writes, as further evidenced in the verse-three lines \"Now the darkness only stays at night time\" and \"Daylight is good at arriving at the right time\".\nThe lyrics underwent minor changes after Harrison presented the song to the Beatles in January 1969, when they began working at London's &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Film%20Studios\"&gt;Twickenham Film Studios&lt;/a&gt; for the so-called \"Get Back\" project (released as the \"Let It Be\" &lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Be%20%28Beatles%20album%29\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Be%20%28film%29\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;). He had initially written the second line of verse two as \"A wind can blow those clouds away\", but &lt;a href=\"John%20Lennon\"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; suggested the word \"mind\" to introduce a bit of \"&lt;a href=\"psychedelia\"&gt;psychedelia&lt;/a&gt;\" into the song, after initially misreading the lyric sheet . Similarly, the repeated line \"It's not always gonna be this grey\" was originally \"It's not always been this grey\" in verses one and two.\nPre-\"All Things Must Pass\" recording history.\nThe Beatles' \"Get Back\" rehearsals.\nIn contrast with the creative equality he enjoyed with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock, Harrison returned to the Beatles to find the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles%20%28album%29\"&gt;White Album&lt;/a&gt; sessions in 1968. Early on during the \"Get Back\" rehearsals \u2013 and tellingly, music journalist &lt;a href=\"John%20Harris%20%28critic%29\"&gt;John Harris&lt;/a&gt; comments, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his partner &lt;a href=\"Yoko%20Ono\"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Harrison enthused to &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Starr\"&gt;Ringo Starr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McCartney\"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; about the Band's camaraderie and group ethos, saying: \"They're just living, and they happen to be a band as well.\"&lt;ref name=\"Harris/Woods p 92\"&gt;John Harris, \"Into the Woods\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mojo%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Mojo&lt;/a&gt;\", December 2003, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 2 January, day one of the Twickenham film shoot, Harrison introduced \"All Things Must Pass\", and the band worked on the song intermittently over the next four days of filming. In the search for a suitable musical arrangement, Harrison stressed his preference for a \"feel\" akin to the Band, a suggestion that resulted in Lennon switching from guitar to &lt;a href=\"Lowrey%20organ\"&gt;Lowrey organ&lt;/a&gt;, a keyboard favoured by the Band's &lt;a href=\"Garth%20Hudson\"&gt;Garth Hudson&lt;/a&gt;. During the Twickenham rehearsals, the Beatles also discussed the idea of Harrison performing \"All Things Must Pass\" solo for inclusion in the proposed film.\nThey returned to the song briefly towards the end of January, by which time the project had moved location to their own &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Studio\"&gt;Apple Studio&lt;/a&gt;, in central London \u2013 one of Harrison's conditions for rejoining the Beatles after his &lt;a href=\"Wah-Wah%20%28song%29%23Background\"&gt;temporary walkout&lt;/a&gt; on 10 January. Although the band gave a fair amount of time to \"All Things Must Pass\", it was ultimately put aside, just as other Harrison compositions including \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Brown%20Shoe\"&gt;Old Brown Shoe&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Isn%27t%20It%20a%20Pity\"&gt;Isn't It a Pity&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Down\"&gt;Let It Down&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Me%20Mine\"&gt;I Me Mine&lt;/a&gt;\" received a lukewarm reception, particularly from Lennon. &lt;a href=\"David%20Fricke\"&gt;David Fricke&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" has referred to this period as a \"struggle\" for Harrison \"against the patronizing restrictions of writing within and for the Beatles\". Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt, authors of \"Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of The Beatles' Let It Be Disaster\", observe that Lennon and McCartney routinely rejected Harrison's songs, \"even though some were far better than their own\".\nThe Beatles never formally recorded \"All Things Must Pass\", and only rehearsal takes circulate on bootleg compilations from the sessions. The \"Fly on the Wall\" bonus disc accompanying the McCartney-instigated \"&lt;a href=\"Let%20It%20Be...%20Naked\"&gt;Let It Be... Naked&lt;/a&gt;\" album (2003) includes a snippet of the Beatles indulging in some Band-like chorusing on the song.\nHarrison's solo demo.\nDuring the Beatles' Apple Studio session on 28 January, Harrison talked with Lennon and Ono about possibly doing a solo album of his unused songs, in order to \"preserve this, the Beatle bit, more\". Lennon offered his support for the idea. While author &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Spizer\"&gt;Bruce Spizer&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that Lennon was keen to \"spare\" the band from having to work on Harrison's songs, Sulpy and Schweighardt consider that Lennon's enthusiasm was because such a solo project would allow him and Ono to continue their own recording activities \"without causing friction within The Beatles\".\nOn 25 February 1969, his 26th birthday, Harrison entered &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road%20Studios\"&gt;Abbey Road Studios&lt;/a&gt; alone and recorded a &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of the song, along with other recent compositions \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29\"&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt;\". With &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Scott\"&gt;Ken Scott&lt;/a&gt; serving as engineer, he recorded two takes of \"All Things Must Pass\", adding extra electric guitar onto the second. This version was eventually released in 1996 on the Beatles' &lt;a href=\"outtake\"&gt;outtake&lt;/a&gt; collection \"&lt;a href=\"Anthology%203\"&gt;Anthology 3&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBilly Preston's version.\nSoon after Harrison had begun talking publicly about making a solo album, during the final months of 1969, he offered \"All Things Must Pass\", along with the more recent \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Sweet%20Lord\"&gt;My Sweet Lord&lt;/a&gt;\", to &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Preston\"&gt;Billy Preston&lt;/a&gt; for the latter's album \"&lt;a href=\"Encouraging%20Words\"&gt;Encouraging Words&lt;/a&gt;\". Through Harrison's invitation, Preston had played keyboards for the Beatles once the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions resumed at Apple Studio, where the 22-year-old Texan had impressed with his superior musicianship and convivial presence. Preston was soon offered a recording deal with Apple Records, \"Encouraging Words\" being the second album under the contract.\nCo-produced by Harrison, Preston's reading of \"All Things Must Pass\" betrays an obvious debt to his former mentor, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Charles\"&gt;Ray Charles&lt;/a&gt;. While Harrison's later recording is generally viewed as the definitive version, Bruce Eder of &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; considers this treatment of the song the superior of the two. Preston's version appeared in September 1970, five months after &lt;a href=\"Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles' break-up&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"All Things Must Pass\" recording.\nWhile completing his production on Preston's release, Harrison chose to record the song himself for what became the title track of his post-Beatles solo debut, the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\". In describing \"All Things Must Pass\" as a \"haunting hymn about the mortality of everything\", author Elliot Huntley notes the added poignance in Harrison's version, due to the death of his mother in July 1970 after a long period of illness.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Spector\"&gt;Phil Spector&lt;/a&gt; as his co-producer, Harrison taped the basic track at Abbey Road Studios between 26 May and early in June. Other participants included Clapton, German bassist &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Voormann\"&gt;Klaus Voormann&lt;/a&gt; and Starr, the latter another avowed Band fan. Leng credits the song's piano part to &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Whitlock\"&gt;Bobby Whitlock&lt;/a&gt;, who also sang backing vocals with Clapton, his future bandmate in &lt;a href=\"Derek%20and%20the%20Dominos\"&gt;Derek and the Dominos&lt;/a&gt;. In his 2010 autobiography, Whitlock states that it was Preston who played the piano on \"All Things Must Pass\", while his own contribution was &lt;a href=\"pump%20organ\"&gt;pump organ&lt;/a&gt;, or harmonium. Although Leng lists both Harrison and Clapton as having played acoustic guitar and Starr and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Gordon%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Jim Gordon&lt;/a&gt; on drums, according to the personnel that Whitlock offers, neither Clapton nor Gordon played on the song. Among the &lt;a href=\"Overdubbing\"&gt;overdubs&lt;/a&gt; on the track, Nashville session musician &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Drake\"&gt;Pete Drake&lt;/a&gt; recorded a &lt;a href=\"Pedal%20steel%20guitar\"&gt;pedal-steel guitar&lt;/a&gt; part during a brief visit to London, to participate in sessions for Harrison songs such as \"&lt;a href=\"Behind%20That%20Locked%20Door\"&gt;Behind That Locked Door&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Live%20for%20You\"&gt;I Live for You&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpector's erratic behaviour during the \"All Things Must Pass\" sessions left Harrison to handle most of the project alone,&lt;ref name=\"Bergstrom/PM\"&gt;John Bergstrom, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.popmatters.com/pm/review/135411-george-harrison-all-things-must-pass/\"&gt;\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass\"&lt;/a&gt; , \"&lt;a href=\"PopMatters\"&gt;PopMatters&lt;/a&gt;\", 14 January 2011 (retrieved 28 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; but in August 1970, after receiving a tape of Harrison's early mixes of the songs, Spector provided him with written feedback and guidance. Spector wrote of \"All Things Must Pass\", \"This particular song is so good that any honest [vocal] performance by you is acceptable as far as I'm concerned\", but he expressed his disapproval of the horns at the start of the track. In the words of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, \"clearer heads prevailed\" and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Price%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Jim Price&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Keys\"&gt;Bobby Keys&lt;/a&gt;' horn parts were retained.\nThe recording opens with \"unvaryingly steady\" piano chords, Inglis writes, and what Leng terms \"sensitive\" string orchestration from &lt;a href=\"John%20Barham\"&gt;John Barham&lt;/a&gt;, soon joined by the horns and Drake's pedal steel. Leng highlights this combination as providing the song with its rising and falling musical moods, implying variously light and darkness; Inglis writes of the musical arrangement mirroring the \"competing impressions\" of hope and melancholy found in Harrison's lyrics. True to its &lt;a href=\"Catskill%20Mountains\"&gt;Catskill&lt;/a&gt; roots, the recording evokes the Band's \"The Weight\" and their &lt;a href=\"The%20Band%20%28album%29\"&gt;eponymous second album&lt;/a&gt;, the tracks on which were similarly inspired by \"the beauty of that autumn in Woodstock\", according to Helm.\nRelease and album artwork.\nAlmost two years after Harrison wrote the song, \"All Things Must Pass\" was released in November 1970, closing side three of the triple album in its original &lt;a href=\"LP%20record\"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt; format. Despite its high retail price, \"All Things Must Pass\" was a major commercial success, comfortably outselling concurrent solo releases by Lennon and McCartney.\nThe song's title was invariably seen as a statement on the demise of the Beatles, as commentators viewed the album as Harrison's liberation from the artistic constraints imposed on him within the band. The album's cover image, showing Harrison seated on his &lt;a href=\"Friar%20Park\"&gt;Friar Park&lt;/a&gt; lawn surrounded by four reclining &lt;a href=\"garden%20gnomes\"&gt;garden gnomes&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 thought to represent the Beatles \u2013 was also viewed as reflecting this theme. While commenting that \"All Things Must Pass\" had \"accrue[d] new layers of relevance\" during the album's creation, particularly with the death of Harrison's mother, former \"&lt;a href=\"Mojo%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Mojo&lt;/a&gt;\" editor &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Du%20Noyer\"&gt;Paul Du Noyer&lt;/a&gt; writes: \"Nobody in November 1970 could have mistaken the title's significance\u00a0... As if to cement the association of ideas, the wry cover picture has George in solitary splendour, surrounded by a quartet of gnomes.\" In a 2001 interview, photographer &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Feinstein\"&gt;Barry Feinstein&lt;/a&gt; admitted that the words \"All Things Must Pass\" had helped inspire his set-up for the photo, saying: \"What else could it be?\u00a0... [It] was over with The Beatles, right? And that title\u00a0... Very symbolic.\"\nReception and legacy.\nOn release, Ben Gerson of \"Rolling Stone\" described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"eloquently hopeful and resigned\" while labelling the album \"the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\".&lt;ref name=\"Gerson/RS\"&gt;Ben Gerson, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-things-must-pass-19710121\"&gt;\"George Harrison \"All Things Must Pass\"\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\", 21 January 1971 (retrieved 3 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; \"Beatles Forever\" author &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Schaffner\"&gt;Nicholas Schaffner&lt;/a&gt; noted in 1977, with reference to Harrison's commercial and critical dominance over his former bandmates following the break-up: \"The very fact that the Beatles had kept George's flowering talents so under wraps proved to be his secret weapon.\" Schaffner named \"All Things Must Pass\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Beware%20of%20Darkness%20%28song%29\"&gt;Beware of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" as the two \"most eloquent\" songs on \"All Things Must Pass\", \"musically as well as lyrically\", with \"mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings and horns hover like &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Jay%20Way\"&gt;Blue Jay Way&lt;/a&gt; fog\".\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2000, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20DeCurtis\"&gt;Anthony DeCurtis&lt;/a&gt; praised the song for its musical demonstration of \"the sweet satisfactions of faith\".&lt;ref name=\"DeCurtis/RS\"&gt;Anthony DeCurtis, , \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\", 12 October 2000 (retrieved 28 April 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; On a triple album where \"nearly every song is excellent\", AllMusic picks \"All Things Must Pass\" as one of five standout tracks (or AMG track picks), with &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Unterberger\"&gt;Richie Unterberger&lt;/a&gt; writing of its autumnal theme: \"It's the kind of song that fits the mood in November, when the trees are getting stripped bare of their leaves, the days are getting shorter and colder, and you have to resign yourself to knowing it's going to be tougher and tougher in those regards for months, also knowing that those hardships will pass away come springtime.\"&lt;ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"&gt;Richie Unterberger, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.allmusic.com/song/all-things-must-pass-t743165\"&gt;\"George Harrison 'All Things Must Pass'\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; (retrieved 17 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In his book on Harrison, subtitled \"A Spiritual Biography\", &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Tillery\"&gt;Gary Tillery&lt;/a&gt; refers to the song as \"magisterial\" and a \"majestic title track\" that \"leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative\". Michael Gallucci of \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Classic%20Rock\"&gt;Ultimate Classic Rock&lt;/a&gt;\" places \"All Things Must Pass\" third on his list of Harrison's best solo songs (behind the two hit singles from \"All Things Must Pass\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"&lt;a href=\"What%20Is%20Life\"&gt;What Is Life&lt;/a&gt;\"), and comments: \"The album's title track takes on more poignancy after Harrison's death [in 2001], but it's always been great.\"&lt;ref name=\"Gallucci/UCR\"&gt;Michael Gallucci, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ultimateclassicrock.com/george-harrison-songs/\"&gt;\"Top 10 George Harrison Songs\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Classic%20Rock\"&gt;Ultimate Classic Rock&lt;/a&gt;\" (retrieved 28 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Guides\"&gt;Rough Guides&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Ingham similarly describes the song as \"a heart-rending piece of significant prescience which seems to take on more poignancy with every passing year\".\nAmong Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng considers \"All Things Must Pass\" a \"classic of Harrison's lyrical ambiguity, in essence a hopeful song, without sounding so\", with a lyric that \"approaches Bob Dylan standard\". Ian Inglis also praises the lyrics, writing: \"The song contains some of Harrison's most insightful and pensive words. 'Daylight is good at arriving at the right time' is a fine example of his\u00a0... ability to position the profound within the commonplace.\" Elliot Huntley rates it as one of Harrison's \"most beautiful\" songs, \"if not \"the\" very best\", and suggests that the sentiments behind \"All Things Must Pass\" would have made it a \"fitting conclusion\" to the final album recorded by the Beatles, \"&lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road\"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969).\nBruce Spizer similarly rates \"All Things Must Pass\" a highlight of Harrison's career, while Leng considers it \"perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition\" of all. In his book \"\", &lt;a href=\"Ian%20MacDonald\"&gt;Ian MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; describes \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles\". In 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" included the track in its list of \"1000 Songs Everyone Must Hear\".\nPerformance and later releases.\n\"All Things Must Pass\" was not a track that Harrison ever played in concert, although it appeared on his preliminary &lt;a href=\"Set%20list\"&gt;setlist&lt;/a&gt; for the 1971 &lt;a href=\"The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Concert for Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; shows. He twice performed the song live in front of TV cameras during the final years of his life, beginning with his appearance with &lt;a href=\"Ravi%20Shankar\"&gt;Ravi Shankar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"VH1\"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Hard Rock Live\", filmed in New York on 14 May 1997. The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, \"&lt;a href=\"Chants%20of%20India\"&gt;Chants of India&lt;/a&gt;\", but at host &lt;a href=\"John%20Fugelsang\"&gt;John Fugelsang&lt;/a&gt;'s urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of \"All Things Must Pass\". In late 2000, Harrison sang \"All Things Must Pass\" while again seated on a stool on Friar Park's main lawn, a performance that was included in the &lt;a href=\"press%20kit\"&gt;press kit&lt;/a&gt; for \"All Things Must Pass\"s &lt;a href=\"All%20Things%20Must%20Pass%232001\"&gt;30th anniversary reissue&lt;/a&gt; early the following year.\nCoinciding with this 2001 reissue, the song appeared on a promotional single as the &lt;a href=\"B-side\"&gt;B-side&lt;/a&gt; to \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Sweet%20Lord%232001%20%E2%80%93%20%26quot%3BMy%20Sweet%20Lord%20%282000%29%26quot%3B\"&gt;My Sweet Lord (2000)&lt;/a&gt;\". After being omitted from the \"cursory\" selection of 1970\u201375 tracks on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20of%20George%20Harrison\"&gt;The Best of George Harrison&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976), Inglis writes, the song appeared on Harrison's 2009 career-spanning compilation \"\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Scorsese\"&gt;Martin Scorsese&lt;/a&gt;'s 2011 documentary ', \"All Things Must Pass\" is the first song featured in the film, played over footage of German air raids over Britain during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In November that year, a 1970-recorded demo of the song (featuring just Harrison, Starr and Voormann) appeared on the accompanying the British DVD release of the film; this CD was subsequently issued worldwide in May 2012 as \"\".&lt;ref name=\"Early Takes/AMG\"&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.allmusic.com/album/early-takes-vol-1-mw0002332516\"&gt;\"George Harrison: \"Early Takes, Vol. 1\"\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; (retrieved 15 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 27 November 2020, the Harrison family released a stereo remix of the \"All Things Must Pass\" recording to mark the album's 50th anniversary.\nCover versions.\nSteve Wood and Daniel May composed music to the 1998 documentary film \"&lt;a href=\"Everest%20%281998%20film%29\"&gt;Everest&lt;/a&gt;\" incorporating melodies from some of George Harrison's songs, one of which was \"All Things Must Pass\".\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Concert%20for%20George\"&gt;Concert for George&lt;/a&gt; tribute to Harrison, held at London's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; on 29 November 2002, Paul McCartney sang \"All Things Must Pass\", backed by a large band that included Preston, Clapton, Voormann and Starr. In his organisation of the tribute concert, Clapton said he approached \"All Things Must Pass\" as the \"key song of the whole event\". Leng comments on the irony in McCartney performing the song, while Beatles biographer &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Doggett\"&gt;Peter Doggett&lt;/a&gt; writes: \"it wasn't hard to imagine Harrison's cynicism as McCartney led the band into a soulful rendition of 'All Things Must Pass' \u2013 one of the songs that the other Beatles had refused to take seriously in January 1969.\" According to Clapton, author Robert Rodriguez writes, McCartney \"was humbled at having to relearn it\".\nSeveral other artists have recorded \"All Things Must Pass\" in the years since Harrison's death. In 2003, Bobby Whitlock and his wife, CoCo Carmel, included the song on their acoustic live album \"Other Assorted Love Songs, Live from Whitney Chapel\".&lt;ref name=\"Eder/AM\"&gt;Bruce Eder, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.allmusic.com/album/other-assorted-love-songs-mw0000498695\"&gt;\"Bobby Whitlock &amp; Kim Carmel \"Other Assorted Love Songs\"\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; (retrieved 30 September 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazz\"&gt;Jazz&lt;/a&gt; guitarist &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Harrison\"&gt;Joel Harrison&lt;/a&gt; covered \"All Things Must Pass\" on his album \"&lt;a href=\"Harrison%20on%20Harrison\"&gt;Harrison on Harrison: Jazz Explanations of George Harrison&lt;/a&gt;\", released in October 2005. In 2007, a live version by &lt;a href=\"the%20Waterboys\"&gt;the Waterboys&lt;/a&gt; appeared on their CD single \"&lt;a href=\"Everybody%20Takes%20a%20Tumble\"&gt;Everybody Takes a Tumble&lt;/a&gt;\", and the following year &lt;a href=\"Sloan%20Wainwright\"&gt;Sloan Wainwright&lt;/a&gt; included a cover of the song on her album \"Rediscovery\".\n\"All Things Must Pass\" was among the Harrison compositions covered by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20James\"&gt;Jim James&lt;/a&gt; on his \"&lt;a href=\"Tribute%20To\"&gt;Tribute To&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, recorded in December 2001 but not released until August 2009. Also in 2009, Klaus Voormann released a version of the song on his solo album \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Sideman%27s%20Journey\"&gt;A Sideman's Journey&lt;/a&gt;\", with &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Islam\"&gt;Yusuf Islam&lt;/a&gt; on vocals and acoustic guitar.\nPersonnel.\nThe musicians who performed on Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" version of the song are believed to be as follows:"
