    "title": "Expansion team",
    "text": "An expansion team is a new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the &lt;a href=\"Major%20professional%20sports%20leagues%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada\"&gt;North American major professional sports leagues&lt;/a&gt; but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with &lt;a href=\"Professional%20sports%20league%20organization%23Structure%20of%20North%20American%20leagues\"&gt;a closed franchise system&lt;/a&gt; of league membership. The term refers to the expansion of the sport into new areas. The addition of an expansion team sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an &lt;a href=\"expansion%20draft\"&gt;expansion draft&lt;/a&gt; to populate the new roster.\nReasons for expansion.\nIn North America, expansion often takes place in response to &lt;a href=\"population%20growth\"&gt;population growth&lt;/a&gt; and geographic shifts of population. Such demographic change results in financial opportunities to engage with the new market as consumers of sports demand local teams to support. &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) was limited to 16 teams located north and east of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; for the first half of the 20th century. During that time, the United States population doubled and expanded to the south and west. Rival interests explored the possibility of forming a &lt;a href=\"Continental%20League\"&gt;rival league&lt;/a&gt; in the untapped markets. To forestall that possibility, one of the measures that MLB took was to expand by four teams in 1961 and 1962. Over the past four decades, MLB expanded further, to its current 30-team membership. In the context of MLB, the term \"expansion team\" is also used to refer to any of the 14 teams enfranchised in the second half of the 20th century.\nLeagues that are new and/or financially struggling may also admit large numbers of expansion teams so that the existing franchises can pocket more revenue from expansion fees. &lt;a href=\"Indoor%20American%20football\"&gt;Indoor American football&lt;/a&gt; leagues are notorious for doing so: the leagues can double the number of teams and have many new teams fail within a year or two. &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;, after spending most of its first decade of existence with relatively stable membership and struggling finances, adopted a policy of continuous expansion beginning in 2005, a policy that the league as of 2017 has no intention of stopping.\nWhen an expansion team begins play, it is generally stocked with less talented &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt;s, inexperienced players, and veterans nearing retirement. Additionally, prospective owners may face expensive fees to the league as well as high startup costs such as stadiums and facilities. The team is also at a disadvantage in that it has not been together as a team as long as its opponents and thus lacks the cohesiveness other teams have built over years. As a result, most expansion teams are known for their poor play during their first seasons. Expansion teams must also compete with any expansion rivals for available talent, a common problem since leagues often expand by two or four teams in one season. \nExpansion teams are not necessarily doomed to mediocrity, however, as most leagues have policies which promote parity, such as drafts and salary caps, which give some expansion teams the opportunity to win championships only a few years after their first season. In &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) The &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"2001%20World%20Series\"&gt;2001 World Series&lt;/a&gt; in their fourth season, and the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Marlins\"&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"1997%20World%20Series\"&gt;1997 World Series&lt;/a&gt; in their fifth season. In the NBA, The &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Bucks\"&gt;Milwaukee Bucks&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"1971%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1971 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; in their third year of existence, greatly helped by drafting &lt;a href=\"Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar\"&gt;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1969%20NBA%20Draft\"&gt;1969 draft&lt;/a&gt; and acquiring &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Robertson\"&gt;Oscar Robertson&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%20Kings\"&gt;Cincinnati Royals&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"1970-71%20NBA%20season\"&gt;1970-71 season&lt;/a&gt; began. In the NHL, the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Panthers\"&gt;Florida Panthers&lt;/a&gt; made the Stanley Cup Finals in &lt;a href=\"1996%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals\"&gt;their third season&lt;/a&gt; even though, like MLB, the league then had no salary cap; a cap was established in 2005. However, the &lt;a href=\"Vegas%20Golden%20Knights\"&gt;Vegas Golden Knights&lt;/a&gt; quickly emerged as one of the NHL's best teams in its first season. Thanks to a generous expansion draft, the team defied all odds and advanced to the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2018 Stanley Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL), despite being considered the most generous in its revenue sharing and the strictest with its salary cap, has had far more difficulty bringing expansion teams up to par with their more established brethren. Of the six teams to have been added to the NFL since the &lt;a href=\"AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger\"&gt;AFL\u2013NFL merger&lt;/a&gt;, the fastest turnaround between an inaugural season and the team's first &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; victory was 27 seasons (the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1976, won &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XXXVII\"&gt;Super Bowl XXXVII&lt;/a&gt; in the 2002 season); none of the four teams to hold expansion drafts since 1995 have ever won that contest, with only one, the &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20Panthers\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt; (who reached the game in their &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XXXVIII\"&gt;9th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%2050\"&gt;21st&lt;/a&gt; seasons of existence) playing in the game. In , the Panthers and &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%20Jaguars\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; each made it to their respective conference championship games in their second season in the league. \nExpansion teams are usually considered as such in their first season and sometimes in their second season. A team that moves to another location and/or changes its name is not an expansion team. If it moves, it is known as a \"relocated team\", and if the name changes, the team is known as a \"renamed team\". In response to a negative attitude that some fans have towards relocated teams, there have recently been instances where relocating clubs change their identity completely; name, colors, and mascot; but because the roster is the same and the league does not expand as a result, they are not regarded as expansion teams. One exception is the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Ravens\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL): when the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns%20relocation%20controversy\"&gt;moved to Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, an agreement was reached for which the trademark and history of the pre-1996 Cleveland Browns remained in that city and was claimed by the post-1999 Browns when the league placed a new franchise there, even though the personnel and roster had moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Another exception is the &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20Pelicans\"&gt;New Orleans Pelicans&lt;/a&gt;, who were previously known as the New Orleans Hornets after relocating to New Orleans from Charlotte, N.C., in 2002. After the 2012 sale of the Hornets, new owner &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Benson\"&gt;Tom Benson&lt;/a&gt; changed the name, colors, and mascot from Hornets to Pelicans. The Charlotte Hornets segment of the franchise's history was sold to the then-&lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Hornets\"&gt;Charlotte Bobcats&lt;/a&gt; (themselves formerly considered a 2004 expansion team) and the 2002 New Orleans Hornets are now officially regarded as an expansion team.\nCities and regions with large populations that lack a team are generally regarded to be the best candidates for new teams. In &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, the United Kingdom-based &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; has added teams from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; to cover a great demographic spread. The operator of Super League, England's &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt;, has also added teams to the lower levels of its league pyramid, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Championship%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"League%201%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;League 1&lt;/a&gt;, from both France and Wales, and most recently &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;, the competition originally known as the Celtic League and now as &lt;a href=\"Pro14\"&gt;Pro14&lt;/a&gt;, which began with sides only from the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20nations\"&gt;Celtic nations&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, and Wales, has added teams from &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and more recently &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S.-based NFL has been laying groundwork for a potential &lt;a href=\"Potential%20London%20NFL%20franchise\"&gt;franchise in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, with a target date some time in the early to mid-2020s.\nExpansion teams in North America.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball (MLB)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; had an eight-team lineup established in 1900, mirrored by the eight charter franchises of the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; in 1901. This list enumerates franchises added since this \"Classic Eight\" era.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association (NBA)&lt;/a&gt;.\nEight charter franchises of the NBA (founded in 1950 via merger of the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;BAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;NBL&lt;/a&gt;) are still active.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League (NFL)&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly extant teams are listed. Two charter franchises, the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Chicago%20Cardinals\"&gt;Chicago Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; (later the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%29\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, now the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Cardinals\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Decatur Staleys&lt;/a&gt; (now the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;), are still active.\n&lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League\"&gt;American Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo teams from the AFL of the 1960s were expansion teams in that league. Both joined the AFL after the merger with the NFL was agreed to, but before it was finalized.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;National Hockey League (NHL)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe NHL had a six-team lineup established in 1942. This list enumerates the teams added since the \"&lt;a href=\"Original%20Six\"&gt;Original Six&lt;/a&gt;\" era.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Rugby\"&gt;Major League Rugby (MLR)&lt;/a&gt;.\nSix of the seven charter franchises from 2018 remain active.\nExpansion teams in Australia and New Zealand.\n&lt;a href=\"AFL%20Women%27s\"&gt;AFL Women's&lt;/a&gt;.\nAFL Women's, launched in 2017 with 8 teams, is operated by the Australian Football League, with all teams fielded by AFL clubs. The league expanded to 10 teams prior to the 2019 season and 14 prior to the 2020 season. In 2023, the remaining four AFL clubs will launch women's sides. \nExpansion teams in Europe.\n&lt;a href=\"United%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;United Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally known as the Celtic League, and later as Pro12 and Pro14.\neSports.\n\"&lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Legends\"&gt;League of Legends&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Legends%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;League of Legends Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (LCS) and the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Legends%20European%20Championship\"&gt;League of Legends European Championship&lt;/a&gt; (LEC) initially fielded teams from eight organizations when they began operations in 2013; both leagues expanded to a total of ten teams in 2015."
