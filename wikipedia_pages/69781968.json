    "text": "Crucifixion plaques are small early medieval sculptures containing a central panel of the still alive but &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;crucified Jesus&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by four smaller ancillary panels consisting of &lt;a href=\"Stephaton\"&gt;Stephaton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Longinus\"&gt;Longinus&lt;/a&gt; (the lance and sponge bearers) in the lower quadrants, and two hovering attendant angels in the quadrants above his arms. Notable examples are found in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20art\"&gt;classical Roman&lt;/a&gt; (usually of ivory) and 8th to mid-12th century Irish &lt;a href=\"Insular%20art\"&gt;Insular art&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are eight surviving Irish examples, although many more were produced. Each is of cast &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; or copper &lt;a href=\"alloy\"&gt;alloy&lt;/a&gt;, and based on their ornamentation and &lt;a href=\"iconography\"&gt;iconography&lt;/a&gt;, are mostly dated to between the late 9th and 12th centuries. Apart from one, they are all of &lt;a href=\"openwork\"&gt;openwork&lt;/a&gt; (ie the figures were formed from holes, piercings, or gaps punched into the metal). The group share similar size and geographical spread, with &lt;a href=\"find%20spot\"&gt;find spot&lt;/a&gt;s ranging from the broad area between &lt;a href=\"Clonmacnoise\"&gt;Clonmacnoise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Offaly\"&gt;County Offaly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tynan\"&gt;Tynan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Armagh\"&gt;County Armagh&lt;/a&gt;. The plaques are all cast as single pieces and, with the exception of the late 7th or early 8th century &lt;a href=\"Rinnegan%20Crucifixion%20Plaque\"&gt;Rinnegan Crucifixion Plaque&lt;/a&gt;, have a unifying border. It is thought that the format is based on similar designs from earlier &lt;a href=\"illuminated%20manuscript\"&gt;illuminated gospels&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Kells\"&gt;Book of Kells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20Psalter\"&gt;Southampton Psalter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe borders of the Irish plaques contain cavities for holding nails or rivets (some of which survive), indicating that they were once attached to a larger wooden or metal &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical\"&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/a&gt; objects, perhaps metal &lt;a href=\"Cumdach\"&gt;book shrines&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;reliquaries&lt;/a&gt;, or wooden altars or crosses. This function is supported by similar designs found in a number of near contemporary stone &lt;a href=\"High%20cross\"&gt;high crosses&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that they might have been transitional works during between stone high crosses in and wooden processional examples such as that found at Tully Lough.\nIrish.\nSurviving examples.\nIn 1980, the art historian &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Harbison\"&gt;Peter Harbison&lt;/a&gt; grouped eight surviving crucifixion plaques as a type based on their format, shared iconography and presumed function. Of these, the origin or provenance of three is known while five are unlocalised. All were rediscovered in the 19th or 20th centuries having been buried or hidden since the &lt;a href=\"early%20medieval\"&gt;early medieval&lt;/a&gt; period, most likely to keep them safe from attacking &lt;a href=\"History_of_Ireland_%28800%E2%80%931169%29%23Early_Viking_raids\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt;s or native forces.\nThe surviving examples are:\nA now lost ninth plaque is known only from a 19th century watercoluor reproduction.\nFormat.\nThe format is likely influenced by folios from early &lt;a href=\"illuminated%20manuscript\"&gt;illuminated&lt;/a&gt; gospels, and it is likely that the craftsmen had copies of these at hand. Examples include folio 200r of the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Kells\"&gt;Book of Kells&lt;/a&gt;, f.38v from the &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20Psalter\"&gt;Southampton Psalter&lt;/a&gt;, miniatures from the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Gospels%20of%20St.%20Gall\"&gt;Irish Gospels of St. Gall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Gospels\"&gt;Durham Gospels&lt;/a&gt;, and the spear bearer on the c. 1026 &lt;a href=\"cumdach\"&gt;cumdach&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Stowe%20Missal\"&gt;Stowe Missal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plaques are generally made from &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alloy\"&gt;alloy&lt;/a&gt;, with the Rinnegan plaque showing evidence of &lt;a href=\"gilding\"&gt;gilding&lt;/a&gt; that is now lost. Except from one badly damaged example which is solid, they all are built from &lt;a href=\"openwork\"&gt;openwork&lt;/a&gt;. They all consist of a central panel of the Crucifixion of Jesus, surrounded four much smaller ancillary figures, with the lower two side panels showing the biblical figures of &lt;a href=\"Stephaton\"&gt;Stephaton&lt;/a&gt; (the sponge-bearer at The Crucifixion) and &lt;a href=\"Longinus\"&gt;Longinus&lt;/a&gt; (the lance-bearer) at Christ's feet, and two hovering attendant angels which are located one at either side of Christ's head. A number of plaques, including those from Rinnegan and Clonmacnoise, contain curvilinear &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20art\"&gt;Celtic designs&lt;/a&gt;, including spirals and &lt;a href=\"Interlace%20%28art%29\"&gt;interlace&lt;/a&gt;. The Clonmacnoise plaque contains two small crosses on either side of Christ's head. In \nThe central figure of Christ is always far larger than the angels and saints. He is usually bearded and given open eyes, and apart from the Clonmacnoise plaque, his feet turned away from each other. In six of the works he is naked except for a &lt;a href=\"loincloth\"&gt;loincloth&lt;/a&gt;; in the Rinnegan and Clonmacnoise plaques he is given a full-length long sleeved garment decorated with interlace patterns. Earlier examples, such as the Rinnegan plaque, contain &lt;a href=\"La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture\"&gt;Ultimate La T\u00e8ne&lt;/a&gt; designs. In some plaques, including that found in Cell Dalua, Christ wears a &lt;a href=\"loin%20cloth\"&gt;loin cloth&lt;/a&gt; or skirt, while in examples such as the Tynan plaque his garment ends above his knees.\nThe reverse of the panels are plain and unadorned and typically contain multiple river holes (some of which are still in place in the Clonmacnoise plaque), indicating that they were once attached to a larger metal or wooden objects.\nDating and function.\nThe absence of Viking influenced animal or &lt;a href=\"Zoomorphism\"&gt;zoomorphic&lt;/a&gt; designs indicates that they produced before the 11th century. While some archeologists suggest dating as late as the early 12th century, the consensus is that the majority originate from between 1000 and 1150. Against this, the Clonmacnoise plague contains vegetative decorations reminiscent of the 11th century &lt;a href=\"Viking%20art%23Ringerike%20Style\"&gt;Ringerike&lt;/a&gt; style of &lt;a href=\"Viking%20art\"&gt;Viking art&lt;/a&gt;. The Clonmacnoise plague is further linked to contemporary metal objects such as the &lt;a href=\"Lismore%20Crozier\"&gt;Lismore Crozier&lt;/a&gt;, including its technical and stylistic approaches and the yet then use of the difficult to source silver &lt;a href=\"inlay\"&gt;inlay&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the plaques intended functions are unknown, they were most likely built to decorate larger &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical\"&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/a&gt; objects such as cumdachs, stone or wooden altar frontals (\"&lt;a href=\"antependium\"&gt;antependium&lt;/a&gt;\"s) or processional or freestanding wooden crosses.\nThis theory is supported by the number of similar mounds and inserts on cotemporary or earlier altars and crosses. A similar sized mount is positioned on the lower part of the 8th or 9th century Tully Lough Cross, while similar compositions can be found on, amongst others, the &lt;a href=\"Ullard%20Church\"&gt;Ullard cross&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Kilkenny\"&gt;County Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, the Cross of St. Columba and St. Patrick at the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20Kells\"&gt;Abbey of Kells&lt;/a&gt;, the South Cross at Clonmacnoise, and a cross on &lt;a href=\"Calf%20of%20Man\"&gt;Calf of Man&lt;/a&gt; island.\nHarbison favors the idea of they were used as &lt;a href=\"Pax%20%28liturgical%20object%29\"&gt;pax&lt;/a&gt;-plates (objects used for the &lt;a href=\"Kiss%20of%20peace\"&gt;Kiss of peace&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;) given their wear around Christ's head which he speculates was because they were passed between members of the clergy and &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28congregation%29\"&gt;congregation&lt;/a&gt; to be kissed. He further suggested that the plaques were produced by a single workshop, a theory refuted in 2014 by &lt;a href=\"Griffin%20Murray\"&gt;Griffin Murray&lt;/a&gt; who points out both their geographical dispersion and provenance (although all seem to have been produced in or around Southern &lt;a href=\"Ulster\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt;) and differences when analysed under &lt;a href=\"x-ray%20fluorescence\"&gt;x-ray fluorescence&lt;/a&gt;."
