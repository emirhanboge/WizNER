Skinnes Hansen played in the top series for the Norway first division team R\u00f8a IL, who had won &lt;a href=\"Toppserien\"&gt;Toppserien&lt;/a&gt; the year before, starting in 2012. The title could not be defended and R\u00f8a was only fourth. In the following years, R\u00f8a commuted between 3rd and 8th place. She also played for R\u00f8a for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2012\u201313 UEFA Women's Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, where R\u00f8a was eliminated against the later winner &lt;a href=\"VfL%20Wolfsburg\"&gt;VfL Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; in the round of 16 after a 4\u20131 away defeat and a 1\u20131 home win. After five years with R\u00f8a, in 2017, she moved to new champions, Lillestr\u00f8m SK Kvinner. With Lillestr\u00f8m she won the Norwegian Championship in 2017 and 2018 and the Norwegian Football Cup in 2018. She played for Lillestr\u00f8m in the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2017\u201318 UEFA Women's Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, where Lillestr\u00f8m lost twice to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20W.F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City W.F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the round of 16. In the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319 UEFA Women's Champions League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona%20Femen%C3%AD\"&gt;FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; were stronger in the quarter-finals. She scored her first CL goal in the Round of 16 in a 2\u20130 away win over &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF\"&gt;Br\u00f8ndby IF&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nSkinnes Hansen was part of Norway junior teams and took part in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Under-19%20Championship\"&gt;2013 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship&lt;/a&gt; in Wales in August, but Norway was eliminated in the group stage. A year later, she and her team reached the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Under-19%20Championship\"&gt;2014 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship&lt;/a&gt; in their home country, but lost 2\u20130 to Spain. Her time in the U-19 ended with eight matches with the U-23 team.\nOn 15 September 2016, she was substituted for captain &lt;a href=\"Maren%20Mjelde\"&gt;Maren Mjelde&lt;/a&gt; in the 10\u20130 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%202017%20qualifying\"&gt;UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; match against Kazakhstan for her first A international at 7\u20130 in the 68th minute. She had to wait a year for her next match. She was therefore not nominated for the European Championship 2017, when Norway was eliminated for the first time without scoring a goal. Also in the following games she was only substituted and also played again for the U-23. On 8 June 2018 she was then in the qualification game against Ireland for the first time in the starting eleven and was allowed to play 90 minutes. In 2019, she was in the starting eleven in all games until the nomination of the World Cup squad, but was almost always replaced, and achieved her first tournament success in the Algarve Cup 2019. On 2 May, she was nominated for the 2019 World Cup."
