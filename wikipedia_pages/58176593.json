    "text": "The Sky Bike is a 1967 colour British &lt;a href=\"children%27s%20film\"&gt;children's film&lt;/a&gt; written and directed by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Frend\"&gt;Charles Frend&lt;/a&gt;. It was Frend's last feature as director. \nPlot.\nTom Smith is an only child who dreams of flying. He lives in English suburbia. He spends a lot of time at an abandoned airfield and there he meets a man who has invented a flying bicycle but it will not stay in the air. They decide to adapt it for two cyclists, to give greater power. Their aim is to win \u00a35000 in a competition for the first man-powered flight.\nThey have a rival team, also based at the airfield, and both are troubled by the security guard and his two Alsatians.\nTom is aided by his friend Porker and his sister Daphne.\nA novel based on the script was later published.\nCritical reception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" called it an \"Imaginative children's adventure film...not always believable, but this flaw can easily be overlooked given the high energy of the production.\""
