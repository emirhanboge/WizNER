The game was released at various dates, varying between continents. The game was released in Japan on March 23, 2006; in North America and Australia during 2006 and in Europe in April 2007. It was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on February 25, 2016.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" is compatible with &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Diamond%20and%20Pearl\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Platinum\"&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20HeartGold%20and%20SoulSilver\"&gt;\"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\"&lt;/a&gt; allowing players to transfer the egg of the &lt;a href=\"legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon\"&gt;legendary Pok\u00e9mon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manaphy\"&gt;Manaphy&lt;/a&gt; to those games. This game is set in the Fiore region.\nGameplay.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" is a &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20game\"&gt;role-playing game&lt;/a&gt; which is designed in a format radically different from that of traditional &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon&lt;/a&gt; RPGs. The player controls a Pok\u00e9mon Ranger in the Fiore region and catches Pok\u00e9mon, temporarily, by using a device called a \"capture styler\", which is controlled by the stylus. The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions with three sub-missions. The only Pok\u00e9mon that travels permanently with the player is a &lt;a href=\"Minun\"&gt;Minun&lt;/a&gt; if the player chooses the male hero or &lt;a href=\"Plusle\"&gt;Plusle&lt;/a&gt; if the player chooses the female hero. The player must loop the Pok\u00e9mon with the \"styler\" a certain number of times to capture them. Pok\u00e9mon may attempt to flee the styler or attack it. The styler has an energy bar that is similar to an HP counter for Pok\u00e9mon on the other Pok\u00e9mon adventure games, when the energy bar of the styler is completely depleted, the player is transported to the last save terminal. The styler can be recharged in a Pok\u00e9mon center like manner at a ranger base, save points are in the bases and scattered throughout the game. There is a quick save option to use in emergencies when a save port can't be found or is too far away. Temporarily caught Pok\u00e9mon can be used in the field to accomplish tasks and solve puzzles by cutting, tackling, shooting fire, blowing water, etc. They can also be used to enhance the styler's loop line. For example, if a water Pok\u00e9mon is selected to aid in capturing a new Pok\u00e9mon, the styler will produce a temporary bubble that immobilizes the target, preventing it from attacking or fleeing.\nPlot.\nSetting.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" is set in the Fiore region. The region's name originates from the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; word for &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Afiore\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;. The Go-Rock Squad is the resident crime syndicate of this region. Fiore itself does not have any native Pok\u00e9mon, but has many Pok\u00e9mon from other regions. It also does not have any &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Trainer\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Trainer&lt;/a&gt;s. All people who live with Pok\u00e9mon keep them outside of &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9%20Ball\"&gt;Pok\u00e9 Ball&lt;/a&gt;s, like pets, as Pok\u00e9mon are never trained here. Fiore is located quite some distance from the other regions of the Pok\u00e9mon world up to the third generation. It is a relatively small island region that is quite mountainous. There are four major settlements in Fiore, each named after the season it constantly experiences \u2014 Ringtown (spring) to the west, Fall City (fall) to the east, Wintown (winter) at foot of mountains to the north and Summerland (summer) on an island to the south. The Krokka Tunnel connects Fall City and Ringtown. From there, one can also get to the Panula Cave, which is also accessible from Summerland's harbor via water vehicle (aka the AquaMole), the coldest spot of the Fiore region, hence ice Pok\u00e9mon appearing there, including the legendary Regice. It leads to Wintown, located on the foot of the Sekra Range. The Sekra Range is a mountain range that is notable for having a waterfall that can \"fill the Capture Arena 23 times in one minute\"; housing the Go-Rock Squad's base; a house high up where the residents inside will recharge the player's Styler; \"Shiftree\", a tree where five &lt;a href=\"Shiftry\"&gt;Shiftry&lt;/a&gt; live in and will attack the player all at the same time; and the Fiore Temple, an ancient temple mountain currently home to a lot of wild Pok\u00e9mon, but with a strange door that will only open when you capture the 3 wanted Pok\u00e9mon; where the game's climax takes place, located at the very summit of the Sekra Range. On the same island where Summerland is located on is a big jungle called the Olive Jungle. Numerous Bug- and Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon live here, and in the center is a ruin, with the same symbols on &lt;a href=\"Kyogre\"&gt;Kyogre&lt;/a&gt;, called the Jungle Relic. In the past, Rangers came to the Relic to test themselves. There are four Challenges involving Dragon Pok\u00e9mon, each representing one of the four &lt;a href=\"classical%20elements\"&gt;classical elements&lt;/a&gt;: the Challenge of Destruction (Earth), the Challenge of Wind (Air), the Challenge of Fire and the Challenge of Water. These Pok\u00e9mon are Flygon, Salamence, Charizard, and Kingdra respectively, as on the cover of \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\". It is said that should all four be cleared, a catastrophe will befall Fiore. After beating the game, the player may roam around free to do almost anything. There is also the Ranger Net for special missions after the main missions. In these missions, the main character is required to capture 3 legendary Pok\u00e9mon not seen anywhere else in the game; &lt;a href=\"Deoxys\"&gt;Deoxys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celebi%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Celebi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mew%20%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\"&gt;Mew&lt;/a&gt;. If the code for the special Manaphy mission is unlocked, it can be used to get the Manaphy Egg, which can later be transferred to &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Diamond%20and%20Pearl\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nThe storyline revolves around a single Pok\u00e9mon Ranger \u2014 Lunick or Solana, depending on the player's choice. In addition to the protagonist characters in the game, several other Pok\u00e9mon Rangers are part of the Ranger Union. Each ranger leader holds domain over that town's rangers. These rangers are named Cameron, Elita, Joel, and Spenser. A professor named Professor Hastings also plays a significant role in the game, as the Chief of Technology for the Ranger Union. The new villainous group, the Go-Rock Squad, has four sub-leaders called the Go-Rock Quads, the leader's three sons and daughter. The Quads have a motto they repeat every time they are encountered. Their original plot is to use the Super Styler, a more powerful version of the original Styler that resembles an organ, to take control of &lt;a href=\"Entei\"&gt;Entei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suicune\"&gt;Suicune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raikou\"&gt;Raikou&lt;/a&gt; to attack citizens of Fiore. They would then command them to stop, leading people to believe the Go-Rock Squad were heroes. They would afterwards command Pok\u00e9mon to start other problems and charge money to solve the problem. The player is then required to prove their worth in three extra post ending missions and capture the enraged legendaries; &lt;a href=\"Kyogre\"&gt;Kyogre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Groudon\"&gt;Groudon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rayquaza\"&gt;Rayquaza&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nInformation regarding \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" was published in the July 2005 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"CoroCoro%20Comic\"&gt;CoroCoro Comic&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine. Little details were shared, which mostly hinted that it was a game and a movie. An announcement on \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" came as a short teaser at the end of the 8th Pok\u00e9mon film, \"\". This game's development was confused for being the same game as \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Mystery%20Dungeon\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPromotion.\nA few episodes of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" animated series have included Pok\u00e9mon Rangers. They go on special missions to help preserve Pok\u00e9mon and human relations, and they are closely related to Pok\u00e9mon breeders. They also have a device that allows them to temporarily control wild Pok\u00e9mon; this device also allows them to scan Pok\u00e9mon, check how healthy they are, and make sure that they are not being interfered with by outside forces. Solana herself has appeared in three episodes of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime, in one of which Solana must stop a disturbed Deoxys.\nSeveral Pok\u00e9mon Rangers can also be battled in &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Ruby%20and%20Sapphire\"&gt;\"Pok\u00e9mon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20FireRed%20and%20LeafGreen\"&gt;\"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Diamond%20and%20Pearl\"&gt;\"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Platinum\"&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Black%20and%20White\"&gt;\"Black\" and \"White\"&lt;/a&gt; and are depicted as protecting the environment and wild Pok\u00e9mon. These Rangers own Pok\u00e9mon which they keep in Pok\u00e9 Balls, and are not true rangers but still have similar intentions to true Pok\u00e9mon Rangers.\nA direct-to-DVD animated film adaptation \"&lt;a href=\"Pok%C3%A9mon%20Ranger%20and%20the%20Temple%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Pok\u00e9mon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" premi\u00e8red on &lt;a href=\"Cartoon%20Network\"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt; on March 23, 2007, and released on DVD the succeeding month. The movie starred a new Ranger named Jack Walker, or Jackie, whose job is to protect a Legendary Manaphy Egg which Ash and company also help in protecting.\nMerchandise.\nA game watch has been manufactured in the theme of \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\". The watch is designed to look like the Pok\u00e9mon Rangers' Capture Styler used for capturing Pok\u00e9mon. The Pok\u00e9mon can be used to help the styler by making bubbles or having leaf blades shoot out or having it on fire.\nReception.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" sold 193,337 copies in Japan on its release week. In terms of games reviews, \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" received fairly positive reaction, with a 70% ratio from &lt;a href=\"GameRankings\"&gt;GameRankings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; gave the game an overall score of 7.1 out of 10, citing the presentation, gameplay and graphics as the game's strong points but also citing the game's use of sound as a major drawback, with issues such as the game's use of the 8-bit sounds from the original Game Boy games as Pok\u00e9mon cries. A lack of a multi-player mode was also a negative point in IGN's review.\n&lt;a href=\"GameSpot\"&gt;GameSpot&lt;/a&gt; gave a similar review to IGN, giving the game a 7.5 out of 10 overall. GameSpot commented that the game's \"unique capturing system\", \"good-sized quest\" and \"attractive 2D graphics and animation\" were the games good points while also commenting that issues such as possible scratching of the touch screen during capture and \"basic exploration sequences\" were the games notable bad points. While discussing the mixed quality of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" spin-offs, &lt;a href=\"Retronauts\"&gt;Retronauts&lt;/a&gt; podcaster Jeremy Parish cited \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" as an example, with Parish later referring to it as \"crappy\". He cites the dialogue and story, commenting that while \"Pok\u00e9mon\" was a kiddy game, the writing in \"Ranger\" is worse than in the main games. Fellow &lt;a href=\"Retronauts\"&gt;Retronauts&lt;/a&gt; contributor Justin Haywald criticized &lt;a href=\"HAL%20Laboratory\"&gt;HAL Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, which he says is normally a good developer, for making \"Ranger\".\nAs of March 31, 2008, \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\" has sold 2.70 million copies worldwide.\nSequels.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia\".\n\"\" is the sequel to \"Pok\u00e9mon Ranger\", and is developed by &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20Inc.\"&gt;Creatures Inc.&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20console\"&gt;video game console&lt;/a&gt;.
