After graduating high school, he played a season of &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Championship\"&gt;Heartland Championship&lt;/a&gt; rugby with &lt;a href=\"Poverty%20Bay%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Poverty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2012%20Heartland%20Championship\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; before later moving to Taranaki to play club rugby with Spotswood United.\nSenior career.\nHalafihi first played provincial rugby for Taranaki during their ITM Cup Premiership title winning season of &lt;a href=\"2014%20ITM%20Cup\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, starting once and coming on as a replacement twice. He was much more of a regular in &lt;a href=\"2015%20ITM%20Cup\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 3 times in 9 outings to help the Bulls reach the Premiership semi-finals where they surrendered their crown to eventual winners, , going down 46-20.\n&lt;a href=\"2016%20Mitre%2010%20Cup\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; saw him play in all 11 of Taranki's games and score 5 tries, although owing to stiff competition from the likes of &lt;a href=\"Lachlan%20Boshier\"&gt;Lachlan Boshier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Brown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Mitchell Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Crosswell\"&gt;Mitchell Crosswell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iopu%20Iopu-Aso\"&gt;Iopu Iopu-Aso&lt;/a&gt;, he was restricted to just 6 starts. His most memorable moment of the year came when he scored the winning try in a 35-32 win over in the final league stage match which ensured Taranaki would claim a home semi-final. Unfortunately for the men from &lt;a href=\"New%20Plymouth\"&gt;New Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;, they were defeated 41-29 by and were forced to wait another 12 months before once more trying to reclaim the Premiership title.\nSuper Rugby.\nGood performances at domestic level for Taranaki over the course of the preceding 2 seasons brought him to the attention of &lt;a href=\"Wellington\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;-based Super Rugby franchise, the who named him in their squad ahead of their title defense in &lt;a href=\"2017%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nOn the 8 December 2021, he was selected by &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Troncon\"&gt;Alessandro Troncon&lt;/a&gt; to be part of an &lt;a href=\"Italy%20A%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Emerging Italy&lt;/a&gt; 27-man squad for the &lt;a href=\"2021%20end-of-year%20rugby%20union%20internationals\"&gt;2021 end-of-year rugby union internationals&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer Honours.\nTaranaki"
