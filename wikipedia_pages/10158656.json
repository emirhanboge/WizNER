    "text": "Archibald Knox (born 1 May 1947) is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach. He was most recently the assistant manager of &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; until leaving the club in March 2013.\nKnox worked with &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant manager at Aberdeen and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Smith\"&gt;Walter Smith&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nAs a player, Knox played in his native Scotland, featuring for &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt; (twice), &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; and a short spell with &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;. During his time with Dundee United, Knox was a runner-up in the 1974 &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; final, his only honour as a player.\nManagerial career.\nKnox's first managerial role came in a &lt;a href=\"player-manager\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; capacity when he returned to first club Forfar in 1976, spending four years in the dual role. In 1980, Knox became assistant to &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;, helping the team to two Scottish Cups, the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;European Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; in his three years with the Dons. In 1983, Knox returned to management with &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;, where he would spend two-and-a-half years, with a best finish of sixth place in 1984\u201385 and 1985\u201386, narrowly missing out on UEFA Cup qualification. A short spell back at Aberdeen followed, before following Ferguson to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; in 1986, where he stayed until April 1991. At this point, Knox came back to Scotland, becoming assistant to &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Smith\"&gt;Walter Smith&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, where the pair would enjoy six titles over the next seven years together. In July 1998, both men moved south to &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;, although their time was ended by March 2002.\nIt was at this point that Knox's association with the national team began, with a three-year spell assisting then-manager &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Brown%20%28footballer%20born%201940%29\"&gt;Craig Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Short spells followed at &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Coventry City&lt;/a&gt; (as assistant to &lt;a href=\"Mark%20McGhee\"&gt;Mark McGhee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Black\"&gt;Eric Black&lt;/a&gt; respectively) before returning to Scotland as &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gough\"&gt;Richard Gough&lt;/a&gt;'s assistant at &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; in November 2004. Knox again assisted the national team as a coach, helping at the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Cup\"&gt;Kirin Cup&lt;/a&gt; in May 2006. Knox was appointed &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland under-21&lt;/a&gt; manager in July 2006 following &lt;a href=\"Rainer%20Bonhof\"&gt;Rainer Bonhof&lt;/a&gt;'s departure. In August 2007 he was appointed as Bolton's Assistant Manager by Wanderers manager &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Lee%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Sammy Lee&lt;/a&gt;. When Lee left Knox was made caretaker manager for two games (against &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and in the UEFA Cup against &lt;a href=\"S.C.%20Braga\"&gt;S.C. Braga&lt;/a&gt;) before &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Megson\"&gt;Gary Megson&lt;/a&gt; took over. Knox remained at the club under Megson.\nTwo days after &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; secured their premiership status he was axed by Megson with six other members of the coaching staff at the club. The club denied it was due to cost-cutting measures and stated it was due to Megson wanting to bring in his own staff.\nOn 4 July 2008 Knox was appointed as the first-team coach of Blackburn Rovers by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Ince\"&gt;Paul Ince&lt;/a&gt;. They had previously worked together at Manchester United. He became the second member of the backroom staff to be appointed by Ince; his appointment followed that of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Mathias\"&gt;Ray Mathias&lt;/a&gt; as assistant manager. On 18 December 2008, Knox was relieved of his duties along with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Mathias\"&gt;Ray Mathias&lt;/a&gt; following the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Ince\"&gt;Paul Ince&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent arrival of &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Allardyce\"&gt;Sam Allardyce&lt;/a&gt; as the new Rovers manager.\nOn 29 December 2009, he was appointed as the assistant manager to &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Brown%20%28footballer%20born%201940%29\"&gt;Craig Brown&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 December 2010, after Brown moved to Aberdeen, Knox followed him back to his former club. After three years with Brown, it announced that he and Brown would leave the club at the end of the season. Though leaving the club, Knox reversed his decision to retire, insisting he \"not retiring now. I still feel young and I've plenty to offer.\"\nIn October 2013, Knox returned to Scottish Championship side Dundee as a playing scout role. Knox will be reunited with manager &lt;a href=\"John%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201962%29\"&gt;John Brown&lt;/a&gt;, whom he signed whilst manager at Dundee.\nIn November 2017, he was one of four inductees into the Aberdeen \"Hall of Fame\".\nHonours.\nAssistant manager.\nAberdeen\nManchester United\nRangers"
