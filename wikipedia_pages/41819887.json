    "text": "The San Antonio Opera was an American &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; company located in &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; that produced 16 seasons of &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; before filing for &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; and dissolving in 2012. The company was founded as the Pocket Opera of San Antonio in 1997 by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Richter\"&gt;Mark Richter&lt;/a&gt;, and opened its first season in the fall of 1997 with &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Schauspieldirektor\"&gt;Der Schauspieldirektor&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%20Playhouse\"&gt;San Pedro Playhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Initially the company's productions utilized local artists, but by the 1999-2000 season the company had begun employing internationally recognized artists. It simultaneously rebranded itself as the Lyric Opera of San Antonio and began performing at the &lt;a href=\"Lila%20Cockrell%20Theatre\"&gt;Lila Cockrell Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. The opera company changed its name to the San Antonio Opera a few years later. Notable artists to have performed with the company include &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Carreras\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Carreras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Bocelli\"&gt;Andrea Bocelli&lt;/a&gt; among others."
