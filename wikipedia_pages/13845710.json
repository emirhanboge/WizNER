The Australian Sports Hall of Fame is also located within the museum along with the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Racing%20Museum\"&gt;Australian Racing Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the Melbourne Cricket Club Museum.\nThe adjoining MCC Museum features exhibitions relating to the history of the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 October 2010, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Racing%20Museum\"&gt;Australian Racing Museum&lt;/a&gt; was absorbed into the Australian Sports Museum, which has now resulted in &lt;a href=\"horse%20racing\"&gt;horse racing&lt;/a&gt; standing alongside other prominent Australian sports.\nThe museum used to be called the National Sports Museum, and closed in August 2019 for a $17.1 million redevelopment ($5 million of which was contributed by the state government). It is set to re-open (with the new name) in February 2020.\nThe adjoining MCC Museum features exhibitions relating to the history of the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nAustralian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum.\nBefore the Australian Sports Museum opened, the Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum operated for 17 years before it closed. The museum was located in front of the former MCC Members Stand which opened in 1928, which was demolished at the same time as the museum. It initially opened on 22 November 1986 before closing to the public on 4 October 2003. More than 35,000 went through the museum in its final week in operation, when it was opened to the public for free in conjunction with access to the former MCC Members Pavilion."
