    "text": "The Ontario Open is a &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournament on the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour%20Canada\"&gt;PGA Tour Canada&lt;/a&gt; that is held in Ontario, Canada.\nIt was founded in 1923 and held every year through 1979, when the Peter Jackson Tour ended. After a long hiatus, an attempted revival in 1989 lasted only one year before the tournament returned for a five year run from 1992 to 1996, during which it was sponsored by the town of &lt;a href=\"Newmarket%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Newmarket, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in the first year and then by &lt;a href=\"Export%20%28cigarette%29\"&gt;Export \"A\"&lt;/a&gt; cigarettes. Another lengthy hiatus followed until the tournament returned as a non-tour event in 2019. The following year, it rejoined the tour schedule.\nThrough 1947 the Ontario Open was a simple 36-hole &lt;a href=\"stroke%20play\"&gt;medal&lt;/a&gt;. Except for a three year span from 1960 to 1962 when it was a 72-hole event, from 1948 until it was cancelled in 1979 it was a 54-hole event. Except for 2019, it has been played as a 72-hole event every year since its first revival."
