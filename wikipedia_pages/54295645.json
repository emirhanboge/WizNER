The group identify themselves as \u201c\"punk witches\"\u201d and are known for their riotous live &lt;a href=\"Concert\"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that mix storming punk guitar with sweet three-part harmonies.\nBiography.\nDream Nails was founded in London in August 2015 by Janey Starling, singer, and Anya Pearson, guitarist. The two friends met through their involvement with &lt;a href=\"Feminism\"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt; activism and brought fellow activist Emmett Roberts on board to play bass and Judith Dawson on drums. In early 2016, Lucy Katz replaced Judith on drums. Within one year of performing together they were invited to perform at Glastonbury's Sisterhood stage \u2013 the first women-only venue at the festival.\nIn 2017, Katherine Christie Evans briefly replaced Roberts on bass and backing vocals, replaced in turn by Mimi Jasson.\nOn 30 April 2021, co-founder and frontwoman Janey Starling announced her departure from the band.\nDream Nails identify themselves as punk witches and their genre as \"\"witch punk\". They claim to write \"hexes, not songs\"\" and are best known for their \"hex on &lt;a href=\"misogynist\"&gt;misogynist&lt;/a&gt; politicians\" \"Deep Heat\". The group's first single was released with a video premiered on Nylon, in time for the 2016 election of the United States of American's president, &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir first &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, \"DIY\" was released in April 2016 with a handmade zine and enjoyed immediate attention from \"Dazed and Confused\". After embarking on short tours in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria, Dream Nails were invited to be the main support for American band &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Glazerr\"&gt;Cherry Glazerr&lt;/a&gt; on their European &lt;a href=\"Concert%20tour\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2017. A second EP \"Dare to Care\" followed in 2017. A live album \"Take Up Space\" - a recording of an acoustic performance at &lt;a href=\"Housmans%20%28bookshop%29\"&gt;Housmans Bookshop&lt;/a&gt; - was released in early 2019.\nThe band promote a &lt;a href=\"DIY%20ethic\"&gt;DIY ethic&lt;/a&gt;, with handmade pedalboards, cut and paste zines and the self-made video for their song \"DIY\" composed of self-submitted mobile phone videos from fans edited together by vocalist Janey.\nIn August 2020 the band released their self-titled first album on &lt;a href=\"Alcopop%21%20Records\"&gt;Alcopop! Records&lt;/a&gt;."
