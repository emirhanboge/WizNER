    "text": "Calder Publications is a publisher of books. Since &lt;a href=\"1949%20in%20literature\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;, the company has published many books on all the arts, particularly subjects such as &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; and painting, the theatre and critical and philosophical theory. Calder's authors have achieved nineteen &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature\"&gt;Nobel Literature Prizes&lt;/a&gt; and three for &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Calder\"&gt;John Calder&lt;/a&gt; started his publishing house in 1949 when manuscripts were plentiful and many books that were in demand were out of print \u2013 in the immediate post-war years paper was scarce and severely rationed.\nDuring the 1950s he built up a list of translated classics, which included the works of &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Chekhov\"&gt;Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tolstoy\"&gt;Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dostoevsky\"&gt;Dostoevsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Zola\"&gt;Zola&lt;/a&gt; among others. Calder then began to publish American titles. As a result of Senator &lt;a href=\"Joe%20McCarthy\"&gt;Joe McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;'s \"witch-hunt\" he was able to acquire significant American authors as well as books on issues of civil liberty that mainstream publishers in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; were afraid to keep on their lists. This led to the development of close ties with those smaller American firms who resisted the &lt;a href=\"McCarthyite\"&gt;McCarthyite&lt;/a&gt; pressure.\nBy the late 1950s, Calder was publishing a group of new writers who would change the face of twentieth-century literature. One of these was &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Beckett\"&gt;Samuel Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, all of whose novels, poetry, criticism, and some of his plays were published by Calder. Several writers on the Calder list became synonymous with the school of the \"&lt;a href=\"nouveau%20roman\"&gt;nouveau roman&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"new novel\", including &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Robbe-Grillet\"&gt;Alain Robbe-Grillet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marguerite%20Duras\"&gt;Marguerite Duras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Simon\"&gt;Claude Simon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathalie%20Sarraute\"&gt;Nathalie Sarraute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Pinget\"&gt;Robert Pinget&lt;/a&gt;. Other European novelists, playwrights and poets included &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20B%C3%B6ll\"&gt;Heinrich B\u00f6ll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Buzzati\"&gt;Dino Buzzati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ionesco\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Arrabal\"&gt;Fernando Arrabal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Obaldia\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 de Obaldia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Weiss\"&gt;Peter Weiss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivo%20Andric\"&gt;Ivo Andric&lt;/a&gt;. Calder was soon launching new experimental British writers such as &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Quin\"&gt;Ann Quin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Burns%20%28author%29\"&gt;Alan Burns&lt;/a&gt;, Eva Tucker and R. C. Kennedy \u2013 who, influenced by their European counterparts, became part of the &lt;a href=\"avant-garde\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; of the early 1960s.\nFrom his experience of authors' tours, John Calder saw that readers much enjoyed hearing authors air their ideas in public \u2013 often in heated debate. He persuaded the &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Festival\"&gt;Edinburgh Festival&lt;/a&gt; to stage large literary conferences \u2013 the first of their kind \u2013 which in 1962 and 1963 were immensely successful. They attracted many of the world's leading writers, as well as others whose names were not yet familiar to the public.\nControversy.\nFollowing their visit to &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, Calder began to publish the previously banned work of writers &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Miller\"&gt;Henry Miller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20S.%20Burroughs\"&gt;William S. Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;. Controversy also surrounded the publication of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Trocchi\"&gt;Alexander Trocchi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Book\"&gt;Cain's Book&lt;/a&gt;\", which was a success despite a minor obscenity trial in &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Selby\"&gt;Hubert Selby&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Exit%20to%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Last Exit to Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;\", although well reviewed, had a more serious case brought against it, first in a private prosecution by Tory MP &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20Black\"&gt;Cyril Black&lt;/a&gt;, and then at the Old Bailey. &lt;a href=\"John%20Mortimer\"&gt;John Mortimer&lt;/a&gt; led a successful appeal and the company was vindicated after losing in both lower courts.\nOwnership.\nIn 1963 the company changed its name to Calder and Boyars to accommodate a new partner (&lt;a href=\"Marion%20Boyars\"&gt;Marion Boyars&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently founded &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Boyars%20Publishers\"&gt;Marion Boyars Publishers&lt;/a&gt;), but the company went back to its original name when the partnership was dissolved in 1975. \nIn 2007, Calder Publications was acquired by Oneworld Classics, a joint venture between Alma Books and &lt;a href=\"Oneworld%20Publications\"&gt;Oneworld Publications&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, Alma Books acquired full ownership of Calder and Oneworld Classics, renaming the latter Alma Classics."
