    "text": "The Abdali-I (&lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;:\u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0649-\u0627; official codename: Hatf\u2013II Abdali) is a &lt;a href=\"Supersonic%20speed\"&gt;supersonic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20nuclear%20weapon\"&gt;tactical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Surface%20to%20surface%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-surface&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"short-range%20ballistic%20missile\"&gt;short-range ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt; (SRBM) designed and developed by the &lt;a href=\"Space%20and%20Upper%20Atmosphere%20Research%20Commission\"&gt;Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SUPARCO), and is named after &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Ahmad Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently in operational service with the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Pakistan Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Abdali program was conceived and originally designed by SUPARCO in the 1990s. The program's first derivative was originally designed as the two-stage version of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hatf-I\"&gt;Hatf-I&lt;/a&gt;\", essentially a &lt;a href=\"solid-propellant\"&gt;solid-propellant&lt;/a&gt; stage was attached to the bottom of a &lt;a href=\"Hatf-I\"&gt;Hatf-I&lt;/a&gt;. However, the program was canceled in 1994, likely due to the purchase of the &lt;a href=\"DF-11\"&gt;M-11&lt;/a&gt; missiles from the &lt;a href=\"People%E2%80%99s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People\u2019s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. In 1995, SUPARCO successfully persuaded and designed a new module for the Abdali program which was started the same year.\nDesign and specification.\nIts accuracy is sufficient for use against military targets such as bases or airfields. It is carried on a road mobile &lt;a href=\"Transporter%20erector%20launcher\"&gt;Transporter-Erector-Launcher&lt;/a&gt; (TEL) vehicle. The use of solid propellant and the TEL vehicle make the missile easy to store, transport and fire.\nThe Abdali-I has a range of 150\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kilometer\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;\u2014190\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kilometer\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; and an accuracy of 100&lt;a href=\"Meter\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt;\u2014150&lt;a href=\"Meter\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Circular%20error%20probable\"&gt;CEP&lt;/a&gt;. It is equipped with an &lt;a href=\"inertial%20guidance%20system\"&gt;inertial guidance system&lt;/a&gt; with terminal guidance. It can be equipped with a variable payload up to 500\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kilogram\"&gt;kg&lt;/a&gt;, and can carry single &lt;a href=\"High%20explosives\"&gt;HE&lt;/a&gt; explosive or cluster sub-munition &lt;a href=\"warhead\"&gt;warhead&lt;/a&gt;s. It has a launch weight of 1,750\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kilogram\"&gt;kg&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a single-stage solid propellant engine and has a length of 9.75&lt;a href=\"Meter\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; and a width of 0.56&lt;a href=\"Meter\"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment history and current status.\nOriginally, the Abdali program was conceived in 1987 and designs of the missiles were adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Space%20and%20Upper%20Atmosphere%20Research%20Commission\"&gt;Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission&lt;/a&gt;, but it never got the adequate funds for the program. In 1993, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan government&lt;/a&gt; took initiatives and considerations on acquiring &lt;a href=\"DF-11\"&gt;M-11&lt;/a&gt; missiles from &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; for a quick deployments. However, the international pressure and the &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Technology%20Control%20Regime\"&gt;MTCR&lt;/a&gt;'s tight monitoring of prevention of any &lt;a href=\"Technology%20transfer\"&gt;transfer&lt;/a&gt; of missile technology led to a denial from &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to export the &lt;a href=\"DF-11\"&gt;M-11&lt;/a&gt; missiles to Pakistan.\nAfter being rebuffed due to international pressure, the &lt;a href=\"Space%20and%20Upper%20Atmosphere%20Research%20Commission\"&gt;Space Research Commission&lt;/a&gt; officials reached out to the government and presented convincing arguments to &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benazir%20Bhutto\"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; on the feasibility of Abdali program. With the backing of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benazir%20Bhutto\"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Space%20and%20Upper%20Atmosphere%20Research%20Commission\"&gt;SRC&lt;/a&gt; began the development of the Abdali program, as its features closely related to the &lt;a href=\"DF-11\"&gt;M-11&lt;/a&gt; missiles. A new design was conceived in 1997 by the &lt;a href=\"Space%20and%20Upper%20Atmosphere%20Research%20Commission\"&gt;SRC&lt;/a&gt; and continues to developed till 2000s.\nOn 28 May 2002, the \"Abdali\u2013I\" was first successfully test fired from &lt;a href=\"Sonmiani%20%28space%20facility%29\"&gt;Sonmiani Test Range&lt;/a&gt; and reached its designated range of 110&lt;a href=\"Miles\"&gt;mi&lt;/a&gt; (180&lt;a href=\"Kilometer\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20military\"&gt;Pakistani military&lt;/a&gt; information source, the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Services%20Public%20Relations\"&gt;ISPR&lt;/a&gt; noted the test trial as \"successful\" and concluded its testing \"for now\". Further and additional tests were conducted on 2005 and 2006. Abdali is currently deployed and under production. Concurrently, the \"Abdali-I\" was again tested out from the &lt;a href=\"Transporter%20erector%20launcher\"&gt;TEL&lt;/a&gt; system and continues to reach its range of 110&lt;a href=\"Miles\"&gt;mi&lt;/a&gt; (180&lt;a href=\"Kilometer\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;). Its last tests were conducted on 13 February 2013, the \"Abdali-I\" was test fired.\nUpon being developed by the &lt;a href=\"SUPARCO\"&gt;SRC&lt;/a&gt;, the missile's name was traced in the remembrance of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghan King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Shah%20Abdali\"&gt;Ahmed Shah Abdali&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=\"dynasty\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Great Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghan Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Shah%20Abdali\"&gt;Ahmed Shah Abdali&lt;/a&gt; was noted to have been in frequent conflict with &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;."
