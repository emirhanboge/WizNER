    "text": "Renaissance Wax is a brand of &lt;a href=\"microcrystalline%20wax\"&gt;microcrystalline wax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Polishing\"&gt;polish&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Antiques%20restoration\"&gt;antique restoration&lt;/a&gt; and museum conservation around the world. Commonly used to polish and conserve metal objects, it is also used on gemstones and such organic materials as wood, ivory, and tortoiseshell. The product is sometimes used by &lt;a href=\"Historical%20reenactment\"&gt;reenactor&lt;/a&gt;s to protect armor and weapons. Waxes are more protective and longer-lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands. It has recently been introduced in the world of guitar building, as a finish that protects and gives colour to the wood. \nWax coatings for conservation are most widely, and least controversially, applied to metals. This has several objectives: to produce a barrier that excludes moisture and oxygen from the metal surface, to preclude the introduction of contaminating elements by handling, and to provide a protective layer over &lt;a href=\"anti-corrosion\"&gt;anti-corrosion&lt;/a&gt; undercoatings.\nMicrocrystalline waxes used on ethnographic metal objects are discouraged, as they may require extensive treatment for removal.\nRenaissance wax is used to protect metals such as silver, brass and copper from tarnishing, on collections of all types of metals (old coins, locks and keys, arms and armour both original and replica), on both the wood and metal surfaces of vintage cars and musical instruments, on bronze sculptures inside the home and outside exposed to the elements, on marble and granite worktops to prevent staining and on smooth leather items.\nFormulation.\nRenaissance Wax was developed in the British Museum Research Laboratory by Dr A E A Werner in the late 1950s. It is manufactured by Picreator Enterprises Ltd.\nEarlier wax polishes based on &lt;a href=\"beeswax\"&gt;beeswax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carnauba%20wax\"&gt;carnauba wax&lt;/a&gt; either contained acids or became acidic over time. Renaissance Wax is based on more stable &lt;a href=\"microcrystalline%20wax\"&gt;microcrystalline wax&lt;/a&gt;es refined from &lt;a href=\"crude%20oil\"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nRenaissance Wax contains polyethylene waxes. Some other microcrystalline waxes intended for conservation use do not contain these."
