    "text": "Quintus Fabius Maximus (possibly Quintus Fabius Maximus Sanga) (died 31 December 45 BC) was a general and politician of the late &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;suffect consul&lt;/a&gt; in 45 BC.\nBiography.\nMaximus was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29\"&gt;patrician&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"gens\"&gt;gens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fabia%20gens\"&gt;Fabia&lt;/a&gt;\". His father was Quintus Fabius Maximus, son of &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Fabius%20Maximus%20Allobrogicus\"&gt;Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus&lt;/a&gt;, the consul in 121 BC. His great-grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Fabius%20Maximus%20Aemilianus\"&gt;Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus&lt;/a&gt;, was also a consul, serving in 145 BC.\nHe first came to notice in 59 BC when, together with &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Caelius%20Rufus\"&gt;Marcus Caelius Rufus&lt;/a&gt;, he prosecuted &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Antonius%20Hybrida\"&gt;Gaius Antonius Hybrida&lt;/a&gt; for extortion in his province of &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; served as lead counsel for the defense, Fabius Maximus and Caelius Rufus were successful. He was elected &lt;a href=\"Curule%20aedile\"&gt;Curule aedile&lt;/a&gt; in 57 BC, during which time he restored the \"Fornix Fabianus\" (Arch of Fabius). Sometime prior to 48 BC, he was elected &lt;a href=\"praetor\"&gt;praetor&lt;/a&gt;. In 46 BC, he was one of &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"legatus\"&gt;legates&lt;/a&gt; who fought in the &lt;a href=\"Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. Maximus was sent by Caesar to &lt;a href=\"Hispania\"&gt;Hispania&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Pedius\"&gt;Quintus Pedius&lt;/a&gt; in command of the troops sent from &lt;a href=\"Sardinia\"&gt;Sardinia&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Pompeians, who were led by &lt;a href=\"Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20%28son%20of%20Pompey%20the%20Great%29\"&gt;Gnaeus Pompeius&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce there, they were unwilling to risk battle with Pompeius's superior numbers, and so remained encamped at Oculbo, waiting for Caesar to arrive in person. Joining Caesar, they defeated Pompeius at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Munda\"&gt;Battle of Munda&lt;/a&gt; on March 17, 45 BC. After the victory, Caesar left Maximus to besiege the town of Munda, which he took and may have destroyed. He then marched against the town of Ursao.\nHe returned to Rome along with Caesar, and in reward for his service, after Caesar abdicated his sole &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt;ship in September, he installed Maximus with &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Trebonius\"&gt;Gaius Trebonius&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"suffect%20consul\"&gt;suffect consul&lt;/a&gt;s on 1 October, 45 BC, the people following Caesar's wishes by voting in his candidates. When Maximus entered a theatre and his &lt;a href=\"lictor\"&gt;lictor&lt;/a&gt;s asked for the audience members to stand, Anti-Caesarean citizens showed their displeasure, shouting \"He is no consul\". Maximus then celebrated his &lt;a href=\"Roman%20triumph\"&gt;Roman triumph&lt;/a&gt; for his victories in Spain on October 13, 45 BC. \nFabius Maximus died on December 31, 45 BC \u2014 the last day of his consulship. According to &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, his death was remarkable because Fabius Maximus showed no symptoms of impending illness or death beforehand. He was replaced for the remaining hours of the year by &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Caninius%20Rebilus%20%28consul%2045%20BC%29\"&gt;Gaius Caninius Rebilus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe had three children: &lt;a href=\"Paullus%20Fabius%20Maximus\"&gt;Paullus Fabius Maximus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Africanus%20Fabius%20Maximus\"&gt;Africanus Fabius Maximus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fabia%20Paullina\"&gt;Fabia Paullina&lt;/a&gt;, who married &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Titius\"&gt;Marcus Titius&lt;/a&gt;."
