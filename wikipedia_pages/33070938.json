    "text": "Dean Mullaney (born June 18, 1954) is an &lt;a href=\"People%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; editor, publisher, and designer whose &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Books\"&gt;Eclipse Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1977, was one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"independent%20comic%20book\"&gt;independent comic-book&lt;/a&gt; companies. Eclipse published some of the first &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novels\"&gt;graphic novels&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first comics publishers to champion &lt;a href=\"creators%27%20rights\"&gt;creators' rights&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2000s, he established the &lt;a href=\"imprint%20%28trade%20name%29\"&gt;imprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Library%20of%20American%20Comics\"&gt;The Library of American Comics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"IDW%20Publishing\"&gt;IDW Publishing&lt;/a&gt; to publish hardcover collections of &lt;a href=\"comic%20strips\"&gt;comic strips&lt;/a&gt;. Mullaney and his work have received seven &lt;a href=\"Eisner%20Award\"&gt;Eisner Award&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nDean Mullaney and his brother, rock musician Jan Mullaney, are the sons of early &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; musician Dave Mullaney of the band &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Butter\"&gt;Hot Butter&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers founded &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Books\"&gt;Eclipse Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island\"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, in 1977, and the following year published one of the first original &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novel\"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt;s, \"&lt;a href=\"Sabre%20%28graphic%20novel%29\"&gt;Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species&lt;/a&gt;\". Written by &lt;a href=\"Don%20McGregor\"&gt;Don McGregor&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gulacy\"&gt;Paul Gulacy&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sabre\" was additionally the first graphic novel sold through the new \"&lt;a href=\"direct%20market\"&gt;direct market&lt;/a&gt;\" of comic-book stores. Eclipse went on to publish the anthology &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Magazine\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;\" and the color-comic anthology \"&lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Monthly\"&gt;Eclipse Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\", the first of an Eclipse Comics line that eventually included such titles and creators as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rocketeer\"&gt;The Rocketeer&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Stevens\"&gt;Dave Stevens&lt;/a&gt;; \"&lt;a href=\"Zot%21\"&gt;Zot!&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Scott%20McCloud\"&gt;Scott McCloud&lt;/a&gt;; two \"&lt;a href=\"Detectives%20Inc.\"&gt;Detectives Inc.&lt;/a&gt;\" graphic novels by McGregor and artists &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Rogers\"&gt;Marshall Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Colan\"&gt;Gene Colan&lt;/a&gt;, respectively; the graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Stewart%20the%20Rat\"&gt;Stewart the Rat&lt;/a&gt;\" by writer &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Gerber\"&gt;Steve Gerber&lt;/a&gt; and artists Colan and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Palmer%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Tom Palmer&lt;/a&gt;; and the U.S. reprints of \"&lt;a href=\"Miracleman\"&gt;Miracleman&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Moore\"&gt;Alan Moore&lt;/a&gt;. Eclipse also brought out graphic novels featuring &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; adaptations, such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Magic%20Flute\"&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"P.%20Craig%20Russell\"&gt;P. Craig Russell&lt;/a&gt;, and children's literature such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hobbit\"&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien\"&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1980 Mullaney moonlighted as co-editor of the brand-new hobbyist publication \"&lt;a href=\"Comics%20Feature\"&gt;Comics Feature&lt;/a&gt;\", produced by Hal Schuster's &lt;a href=\"New%20Media%20Publishing\"&gt;New Media Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, but left after one year to focus on Eclipse.\nIn the early 1980s, Mullaney met writer-editor &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Yronwode\"&gt;Catherine Yronwode&lt;/a&gt;, who was working for cartoonist and entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"Will%20Eisner\"&gt;Will Eisner&lt;/a&gt;. Yronwode recalled that Eisner and his wife Ann \"hosted a party for me with all these comic book men I was flirting with. All these men came up; they all wanted to meet Will. One of them was Dean Mullaney, the co-owner of Eclipse Comics, a small independent publishing house. He was the most flirtatious.\" At some point afterward, once Yronwode finished her work organizing Eisner's archives, she and Mullaney became engaged and moved to &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, where they were married.\nBy the late 1980s, Eclipse was selling a half-million comics a month, and was the third largest comics publisher after &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Comics\"&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DC%20Comics\"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1986, Eclipse lost most of its back-issue stock in a flood. This event, along with the repercussions of Mullaney's divorce from Yronwode, by then his partner at Eclipse, and the mid-1990s collapse of the &lt;a href=\"direct%20market\"&gt;direct market&lt;/a&gt; distribution system, caused the company to cease operations in 1994 and file for bankruptcy in 1995. The company's &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20property\"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; rights were later acquired by &lt;a href=\"Todd%20McFarlane\"&gt;Todd McFarlane&lt;/a&gt;. Mullaney also attributed the company's demise to a problematic contract with the book publisher &lt;a href=\"HarperCollins\"&gt;HarperCollins&lt;/a&gt;. Eclipse's last publication was its Spring 1993 catalog, which was a complete bibliography of its publications.\nIn the mid-2000s, Mullaney approached &lt;a href=\"IDW%20Publishing\"&gt;IDW Publishing&lt;/a&gt; with a proposal to publish hardcover reprints of American &lt;a href=\"comic%20strips\"&gt;comic strips&lt;/a&gt;. This became the IDW &lt;a href=\"imprint%20%28trade%20name%29\"&gt;imprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Library%20of%20American%20Comics\"&gt;The Library of American Comics&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted with the 2007 book \"The Complete &lt;a href=\"Terry%20and%20the%20Pirates%20%28comic%20strip%29\"&gt;Terry and the Pirates&lt;/a&gt;, Vol. 1: 1934-1936\", by &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Caniff\"&gt;Milton Caniff&lt;/a&gt;. As Mullaney described, \"\"Terry\"'s always been my favorite strip, and I was going to publish it in the early '80s (through Eclipse Comics), but Terry Nantier at &lt;a href=\"NBM%20Publishing\"&gt;NBM&lt;/a&gt; beat me to it. Luckily, I've lived long enough so that 25 years later I'm in a position to release new editions of \"Terry\". With Mullaney as its creative director, the imprint has gone on to publish collections of strips including \"&lt;a href=\"Dick%20Tracy\"&gt;Dick Tracy&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Orphan%20Annie\"&gt;Little Orphan Annie&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bringing%20Up%20Father\"&gt;Bringing Up Father&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Family%20Circus\"&gt;Family Circus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Bloom%20County\"&gt;Bloom County&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2014, Mullaney added another imprint at IDW, EuroComics, in order to publish new English translations of European comics, including Hugo Pratt\u2019s \"Corto Maltese\", \"Paracuellos\" by Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, and \"Alack Sinner\" by Mu\u00f1oz and Sampaya.\nIn December, 2021 it was announced that LoAC and EuroComics would move from IDW to a new publisher, Clover Press.\nAwards.\nAs creative director and editor of &lt;a href=\"The%20Library%20of%20American%20Comics\"&gt;The Library of American Comics&lt;/a&gt;, Mullaney has won seven Eisner awards and one Harvey Award. Eisner source unless otherwise indicated:\nMullaney won a 2012 &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Award\"&gt;Harvey Award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic Presentation for \"Genius, Illustrated: The Life and Art of Alex Toth\".\nAdditionally, Mullaney received the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International\"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con International&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Inkpot%20Award\"&gt;Inkpot Award&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. The following year, he was inducted into editor-publisher &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Overstreet\"&gt;Robert Overstreet&lt;/a&gt;'s Overstreet Hall of Fame."
