The seat had been held by former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrius%20Kubilius\"&gt;Andrius Kubilius&lt;/a&gt;, who opted not to run for reelection in the constituency. Considered to be a safe seat for the &lt;a href=\"Homeland%20Union\"&gt;Homeland Union&lt;/a&gt;, \u0160imonyt\u0117 ran as an &lt;a href=\"independent%20politician\"&gt;independent candidate&lt;/a&gt;, but received electoral assistance from the Homeland Union. In the election, \u0160imonyt\u0117 was one of only three constituency candidates nationwide to win their elections without having to advance to a second round run-off election, having won 51.54% of the electorate within her constituency in the first round. Following her win, she took her seat in the &lt;a href=\"Seimas\"&gt;Seimas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter her election to the Seimas, \u0160imonyt\u0117 joined the parliamentary group of the Homeland Union, despite being officially an independent politician.

She ultimately won the nomination, receiving 79% of the vote.\nGoing into the election as the Homeland Union candidate, \u0160imonyt\u0117 was one of the favourites to win, continuously polling in a near-deadlocked tie for first with independent candidate &lt;a href=\"Gitanas%20Naus%C4%97da\"&gt;Gitanas Naus\u0117da&lt;/a&gt;. The first round of the election was held on 12 May 2019, where \u0160imonyt\u0117 narrowly placed first with 31.53% of the vote, ahead of Naus\u0117da's 31.16%.

Following the certification of the election results, it emerged that the Homeland Union had won a plurality of seats, overtaking the incumbent government led by the &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Farmers%20and%20Greens%20Union\"&gt;Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the election a coalition was expected to be formed between the Homeland Union, the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Movement%20%28Lithuania%29\"&gt;Liberal Movement&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Party%20%28Lithuania%29\"&gt;Freedom Party&lt;/a&gt;, with all three parties proposing \u0160imonyt\u0117 to serve as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;. If confirmed, the government would be led by three women: \u0160imonyt\u0117, Liberal Movement leader &lt;a href=\"Viktorija%20%C4%8Cmilyt%C4%97\"&gt;Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117&lt;/a&gt;, and Freedom Party leader &lt;a href=\"Au%C5%A1rin%C4%97%20Armonait%C4%97\"&gt;Au\u0161rin\u0117 Armonait\u0117&lt;/a&gt;, following in the footsteps of the &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Cabinet\"&gt;Marin Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in Finland.\nOn 9 November, the coalition agreement was signed between the Homeland Union, Liberal Movement, and Freedom Party, paving the way for \u0160imonyt\u0117 to become Prime Minister.

Two days later, restrictions were put in place.\nThe vaccination program began on 27 December 2020, as in the rest of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The first to receive the vaccine were healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients.\nOn 4 January, Lithuanian government confirmed backlog of 293 deaths that were previously unaccounted in statistic.\nFrom 15 February, partial lifting of lockdown was made, including decision to re-open small shops and beauty salons.

On 18 March the &lt;a href=\"European%20Medicines%20Agency\"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; said the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe.

Lithuania also supports the expansion of EU sanctions. During the meeting, the Prime Minister said:\n&lt;...&gt; Release of political prisoners, end of repression, and free and democratic elections are the key steps that Belarusians are demanding. Lithuania and the entire democratic world demand the same.\n\"Belaruskali\" scandal.\nOn 9 August 2021, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; announced sanctions against &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; potash exporter \"Belaruskali\". The United States &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Foreign%20Assets%20Control\"&gt;Office of Foreign Assets Control&lt;/a&gt; gave until 8 December 2021 to end all contracts and exporting of \"Belaruskali\".\nOn 7 December 2021, one day before the United States sanctions came into action \u0160imonyt\u0117 said that the sanctions \"have some specifics\" and it was not yet clear how they will be implemented in Lithuania.\nOn 8 December 2021, when the saction had come into effect, &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Railways\"&gt;Lithuanian Railways&lt;/a&gt; company \"LTG Cargo\" announced that in November they had made a \"pre-paid\" contract with \"Belaruskali\" and will still export it's one million tons of potash products to Baltic Port of &lt;a href=\"Klaip%C4%97da\"&gt;Klaip\u0117da&lt;/a&gt; in December until January 2022. On 10 December 2021 &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%2C%20Lithuania\"&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gabrielius%20Landsbergis\"&gt;Gabrielius Landsbergis&lt;/a&gt; and Minister of Transport Marius Skuoda had formally informed \u0160imonyt\u0117 and &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;President of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gitanas%20Naus%C4%97da\"&gt;Gitanas Naus\u0117da&lt;/a&gt; about being ready to resign from their duties following the scandal.\nWhen the \"Belaruskali\" scandal broke, many opposing franctions such as the &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Farmers%20and%20Greens%20Union\"&gt;Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Social Democratic Party of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; were urging \u0160imonyt\u0117 and her government to step down and take on the blame. Many criticised Landsbergis especially who said he had only known of \"Belaruskali\" advance payments in September for the month of October, and was not informed about the subsequent payments later on. While Lithunian Railways stated they had informed the minster. On 13 December 2021, before announcing her formal decison about the two minsters Lansbergis and Skuoda, and her own government, \u0160imonyt\u0117 said in an interview \"That it is hard to take on political reponsabilities, and when done, receive more criticism\".\nOn 14 December 2021, \u0160imonyt\u0117 had announced she had rejected the letters of resignation from Landsbergis and Skuoda, as well as stating that her government will not step down. \u201cTaking into account the escalated geopolitical situation, as well as the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and migration, it would be irresponsible to risk and cause uncertainty that would accompany even an attempt to form a new ruling coalition or significantly change the government makeup\", \u0160imonyt\u0117 said in her statment. Also in her statment she said that she saw no mistakes being made by both Landsbergis and Skuoda, but rather by the company \"LTG Cargo\" and it's director Mantas Bartu\u0161ka who still continued to sign contracts with \"Belaruskali\". \u0160imonyt\u0117 also stated that the company's contracts with potash exporter \"Belaruskali\" should have been submitted to the governmental National Security Commission for evaluation. It was later announced that Mantas Bartu\u0161ka will step down from his duties in the company.\nPolitical stances.\nForeign policy.\nIn October 2018, during a debate on foreign policy for the &lt;a href=\"Homeland%20Union\"&gt;Homeland Union&lt;/a&gt; nomination in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Lithuanian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2019 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, \u0160imonyt\u0117 stated that if elected president, she would increase funding for national security and defense. She has referred to &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; as a \"state that has broken all international agreements\", and called Russia a threat to European security. Additionally, \u0160imonyt\u0117 has referred to &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; as an ally, and has encouraged improving relations between the two countries. She said that Russia offers its &lt;a href=\"Sputnik%20V%20COVID-19%20vaccine\"&gt;Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; \"to the world as another hybrid weapon to divide and rule.\"\n\u0160imonyt\u0117 supports scientific data on &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, and referred to &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20withdrawal%20from%20the%20Paris%20Agreement\"&gt;withdraw&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Agreement\"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt; as a \"mistake\".\n\u0160imonyt\u0117\u2019s new ruling coalition has agreed to defend \"those fighting for freedom\" in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Lithuania's relations with &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; would not be a priority for her government.\nDomestic policy.\n\u0160imonyt\u0117 has stated that she did not oppose the introduction of &lt;a href=\"civil%20union\"&gt;same-sex civil union&lt;/a&gt;s to Lithuania, which attracted the support of &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20Lithuania\"&gt;LGBT rights activists&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, \u0160imonyt\u0117 stated that while she would never have an &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; herself, she would not condemn women who choose to do so.\n\u0160imonyt\u0117 was criticized by the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Lithuania\"&gt;Jewish community in Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; after she opposed removing a plaque to &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Noreika\"&gt;Jonas Noreika&lt;/a&gt;, who had signed the declaration to establish &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20ghettos%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Jewish ghettos&lt;/a&gt; in Lithuania during the &lt;a href=\"German%20occupation%20of%20Lithuania%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;German occupation of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in 1941.\nPersonal life.\nIn addition to her native &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20language\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt;, \u0160imonyt\u0117 also speaks &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, as well as basic-level &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;.
