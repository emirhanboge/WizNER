    "text": "USS \"Charles Whittemore\" (ID-3232) was a four masted lumber schooner used as a decoy ship against German &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt;s during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n\"Charles Whittemore\" was built by Michael B. McDonald and Sons of &lt;a href=\"Mystic%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Mystic, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. She was launched on September 21, 1905, six weeks after McDonald's shipyard went into receivership. Her original owner was F. P. Boggs of Boston. Her first master was Captain S. H. Perry. She was originally employed in the lumber trade between South Carolina and Nova Scotia. \nOn March 13, 1918 \"Charles Whittemore\" lost her rudder in a storm off of &lt;a href=\"Block%20Island\"&gt;Block Island&lt;/a&gt;, Rhode Island. The former Spanish cruiser &lt;a href=\"USS%20Don%20Juan%20de%20Austria\"&gt;USS \"Don Juan de Austria\"&lt;/a&gt; was sent from the Naval Station in Newport, Rhode Island to tow \"Charles Whittemore\" to Newport where was taken into service and commissioned in the United States Navy.\nAt this point, the single greatest naval threat to the United States was German U-boats. As effective anti-submarine methods had not yet been developed, many novel approaches were used. In the case of \"Charles Whittemore\" it was decided that she would resume her role as an innocuous merchant ship in the hopes that she would become a target for U-boats. As \"Charles Whittemore\" was a relatively small sailing vessel, it was likely that a U-boat commander would not consider her worth a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it was hoped, a submarine would surface and attempt to sink \"Charles Whittemore\" with its &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;. In anticipation of this eventuality, \"Charles Whittemore\" would be towing a submarine on the theory that the submarine could sink the U-boat before \"Charles Whittemore\" would be sunk.\nUSS \"Charles Whittemore\" was commissioned on 9 August 1918, with Lieutenant J. Lyons, &lt;a href=\"US%20Navy%20Reserve\"&gt;USNRF&lt;/a&gt;, in command.\nThe schooner cleared New London 15 August 1918 towing the submarine &lt;a href=\"USS%20N-5%20%28SS-57%29\"&gt;USS \"N-5\" (SS-57)&lt;/a&gt; bound for the shipping lanes in the North Atlantic where it was hoped German submarines would attack a seemingly defenseless ship. Since no contact was made with the enemy, and \"N-5\" broke loose during a storm, \"Charles Whittemore\" returned to New London on 9 September. She later conducted a similar mission with the submarine &lt;a href=\"USS%20L-8%20%28SS-48%29\"&gt;USS \"L-8\"&lt;/a&gt; without encountering a hostile submarine.\nContinuing her service with the Atlantic Submarine Force, the \"Charles Whittemore\" carried submarine supplies, vital spare parts, and other cargo between New York, Newport, New London, Bermuda, and Charleston, S. C., until 14 May 1919 when she returned to New York from Hampton Roads to be sold. She was decommissioned and transferred to her new owner 20 May 1919.\n\"Charles Whittemore\" later was damaged by fire and a storm off &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Cod\"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt; on 11 January 1927, and abandoned at sea.\nExternal links.\n "
