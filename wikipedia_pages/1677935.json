    "text": "The following is a list of &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;s, all situated in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Thailand\"&gt;Gulf of Thailand&lt;/a&gt; (, Chhoung Samut Siem). All islands are, apart from the group of the outer islands, in relative proximity to the coast and can easily and quickly be reached. The north-westernmost islands near and around the &lt;a href=\"Koh%20Kong%20%28city%29\"&gt;Koh Kong&lt;/a&gt; river (Khmer: Prek Kaoh Pao) delta area are to a great extent engulfed in contiguous &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt; marshes and consequently hard to recognize.\nAlmost all islands have more than one name and there are islands sharing names (e.g. 2 x Koh Moul, 2 x Koh Domloung). Ancient Malay and &lt;a href=\"French%20protectorate%20of%20Cambodia\"&gt;French colonial&lt;/a&gt; names are still being used and/or have merged with Khmer names. Individual and unstandardized &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Khmer\"&gt;Romanization of Khmer&lt;/a&gt; writing has resulted in multiple spelling variants of the island's names. Sources, such as &lt;a href=\"Geonames\"&gt;Geonames&lt;/a&gt; offer several variants. Tables below follow the geography from north-west to south-east."
