    "text": "Ligusticum scoticum, known as Scots lovage, or Scottish licorice-root, is a &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"celery\"&gt;celery&lt;/a&gt; family &lt;a href=\"Apiaceae\"&gt;Apiaceae&lt;/a&gt; (previously Umbelliferae) found near the coasts of northern Europe and north-eastern North America. It grows up to tall and is found in rock crevices and cliff-top grassland. It is closely related to, and possibly conspecific with, \"&lt;a href=\"Ligusticum%20hultenii\"&gt;Ligusticum hultenii&lt;/a&gt;\" from the coast of the northern Pacific Ocean. The plant is edible and contains the compound &lt;a href=\"sotolon\"&gt;sotolon&lt;/a&gt;, which is also present in &lt;a href=\"fenugreek\"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves have a flavour similar to &lt;a href=\"parsley\"&gt;parsley&lt;/a&gt; or celery, while the seeds taste similar to &lt;a href=\"fenugreek\"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cumin\"&gt;cumin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Ligusticum scoticum\" is a &lt;a href=\"herbaceous%20plant\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt; which typically grows tall. It has triangular, twice-&lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology\"&gt;ternate&lt;/a&gt; leaves, long, with each lobe long. The edges of the leaves may be toothed, lobed or serrated, and are typically either a paler green or magenta. The &lt;a href=\"Plant%20stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt; branches infrequently, and bears 2\u20135 &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt;s, each of which is a compound &lt;a href=\"umbel\"&gt;umbel&lt;/a&gt; in diameter. There are typically 8\u201312 rays in both the primary and secondary umbels. Each individual flower is around in diameter and greenish-white in colour. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; are long, with five prominent ridges on each &lt;a href=\"carpel\"&gt;carpel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Ligusticum scoticum\" tastes and smells like &lt;a href=\"parsley\"&gt;parsley&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"celery\"&gt;celery&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\n\"Ligusticum scoticum\" is primarily an &lt;a href=\"Arctic\"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt; plant, with a &lt;a href=\"disjunct%20distribution\"&gt;disjunct range&lt;/a&gt; extending from &lt;a href=\"northern%20Norway\"&gt;northern Norway&lt;/a&gt; to the more northerly shores of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and from western &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;. A related species, \"&lt;a href=\"Ligusticum%20hultenii\"&gt;Ligusticum hultenii&lt;/a&gt;\", which was described by &lt;a href=\"Merritt%20Lyndon%20Fernald\"&gt;Merritt Lyndon Fernald&lt;/a&gt; in 1930 and may be better treated as a &lt;a href=\"subspecies\"&gt;subspecies&lt;/a&gt; of \"L.\u00a0scoticum\", occurs around the northern Pacific Ocean, from &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. The southernmost occurrence of \"L.\u00a0scoticum\" is at &lt;a href=\"Ballyhalbert\"&gt;Ballyhalbert&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nEcology.\nWithin the British Isles, \"Ligusticum scoticum\" is only found on coasts where the mean July &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; is below , and this bound is likely also to apply in other parts of the species' range. Towards the southern end of its range, the plant performs poorly on south-facing sites. It grows in fissures in rocks, where it may be the only vascular plant, and also in cliff-top grassland communities dominated by \"&lt;a href=\"Festuca%20rubra\"&gt;Festuca rubra&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Plantago%20maritima\"&gt;Plantago maritima&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Ligusticum scoticum\" cannot tolerate &lt;a href=\"grazing\"&gt;grazing&lt;/a&gt;, and is harmed by the actions of nesting &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s; it is therefore rarely found on bird cliffs, or where grazing sheep and rabbits are found. It is, however, tolerant of &lt;a href=\"salt%20spray\"&gt;salt spray&lt;/a&gt;, and its growth has been shown to improve when given dilute &lt;a href=\"sea%20water\"&gt;sea water&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves of \"L.\u00a0scoticum\" are frost-tolerant, and die back each winter, but regrow very rapidly the following spring. In the British Isles, &lt;a href=\"flowering\"&gt;flowering&lt;/a&gt; occurs from June to August, and the seeds are ripe in October or November; the timing is expected to be later at higher latitudes. The flowers of \"L.\u00a0scoticum\" are visited by generalist &lt;a href=\"pollinator\"&gt;pollinator&lt;/a&gt;s, mostly &lt;a href=\"fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Ligusticum scoticum\" was first described by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; in his 1753 work '. Linnaeus originally used the &lt;a href=\"specific%20name%20%28botany%29\"&gt;epithet&lt;/a&gt; ', and this is used by many authors in North America; in Europe, the amended spelling \"\" is used.\nUses.\nThe plant was formerly widely eaten in western Britain, both for nutrition and to combat &lt;a href=\"scurvy\"&gt;scurvy&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves and stalks are edible before the flowers appear, and contain &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20A\"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20C\"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;. They can be consumed raw or cooked like celery. Additionally, the young shoots can be candied."
