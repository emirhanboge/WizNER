Carr pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay US$956,000 in restitution to Sutherland and his investment partner.\nPolitical views.\nSutherland identifies as a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;political liberal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his January 2007 interview with &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Rose\"&gt;Charlie Rose&lt;/a&gt;, Sutherland said of his political views: \nI believe inherently that we have a responsibility to take care of each other, so when you talk about &lt;a href=\"Universal%20health%20care\"&gt;socialized health care&lt;/a&gt;: absolutely, that's a no-brainer. &lt;a href=\"Free%20education\"&gt;Free universities&lt;/a&gt;: absolutely, that's a no-brainer. So, in the definition, I guess those are leaning toward &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; politics. To me, it's common sense.\nCharity work.\nSutherland is a member of a Canadian charity Artists Against Racism."
