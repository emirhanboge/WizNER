    "text": "Horatio Ross (5 September 1801 \u2013 6 December 1886) was a celebrated sportsman and a &lt;a href=\"early%20photography\"&gt;pioneer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amateur\"&gt;amateur&lt;/a&gt; photographer.\nBackground and early life.\nRoss was born at &lt;a href=\"Rossie%20Castle\"&gt;Rossie Castle&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Montrose%2C%20Angus\"&gt;Montrose, Angus&lt;/a&gt; on 5 September 1801, the son of &lt;a href=\"Hercules%20Ross\"&gt;Hercules Ross&lt;/a&gt;, a rich landowner, and his wife, Henrietta Parrish. His father had acquired a substantial fortune in St Andrew's parish in &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;. Horatio was named after his godfather, &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Horatio Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, his father's intimate friend.\nIn 1817, following his father's death, he inherited the large Rossie Castle estate.\nAs a young man, he embarked on a brief military career, with a &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"14th%20King%27s%20Hussars\"&gt;14th Light Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;, and an equally brief political career as MP (first for &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20Burghs%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Aberdeen Burghs&lt;/a&gt; and then for &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20Burghs%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Montrose Burghs&lt;/a&gt;) between 1831 and 1835. However, he was reluctant to engage too deeply in any activity that might distract him from his primary and abiding passion for &lt;a href=\"field%20sports\"&gt;field sports&lt;/a&gt;.\nSporting activities.\nHis sporting activities were numerous and were recorded in \"Sportascrapiana\" (1867), a collection of anecdotes edited by C.A.Wheeler. He was a fine cricketer, a &lt;a href=\"sculling\"&gt;sculling&lt;/a&gt; champion and a prize-winning yachtsman. In 1826, on Clinker, he won a famous &lt;a href=\"Steeplechase%20%28horse%20racing%29\"&gt;steeplechase&lt;/a&gt; against Captain Douglas, on Radical, a horse owned by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kennedy\"&gt;Lord Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a remarkable pedestrian. On one occasion, Lord Kennedy had engaged in a walking match with Sir Andrew Leith Hay for \u00a32,500. Ross was asked to act as umpire. Despite having just finished a full day's shooting, he set off at 9.00pm to walk nearly 100 miles from &lt;a href=\"Banchory\"&gt;Banchory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kincardineshire\"&gt;Kincardineshire&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt;. He walked through the night, the following day and the next night, arriving at Inverness at 6.00am. His boots having disintegrated, he completed the last 25 miles or so barefoot.\nShooting.\nHowever, Ross's greatest feats were as a &lt;a href=\"marksman\"&gt;marksman&lt;/a&gt;. He took part in many matches with the leading shots of the day, such as General Anson, and was much assisted by his extraordinary fitness and stamina, which lasted into his old age. On his 82nd birthday, he killed 82 grouse with 82 shots. On one occasion he challenged the Honourable George Vernon to a shooting match at 100 yards, which he won, despite using a pistol while Vernon used a rifle. On the same day, he won \u00a3100 from &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Baring\"&gt;Henry Baring&lt;/a&gt; by hitting a hat with his pistol at one hundred yards' distance.\nHe and his sons regularly carried all before them at the most prestigious annual rifle competitions at &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%2C%20London\"&gt;Wimbledon, London&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps his most remarkable feat with the rifle was performed in 1867. In that year he won the cup of the Cambridge Long Range Rifle Club against nearly all the best shots of the three kingdoms. The competition extended up to eleven hundred yards, a test of nerve, judgment, and, most of all, of eyesight, which it would seem wholly impossible for any man in his sixty-sixth year to stand successfully.\nIn 1899, &lt;a href=\"The%20English%20Illustrated%20Magazine\"&gt;The English Illustrated Magazine&lt;/a&gt; described him as \"undoubtedly the deer stalker of the expiring century.\"\nIn the society amid which Captain Ross spent his youth challenges and &lt;a href=\"duel\"&gt;duel&lt;/a&gt;s were no uncommon occurrence. He himself never appears to have been in any danger of figuring as principal. But he acted as second no fewer than sixteen times, and was justly proud of the fact that on every single occasion he had prevented a shot being fired. This was stated by him in his latter days in a published letter in which he emphatically condemned the system of duelling.\nPhotography.\nIn the mid-1840s Ross took up &lt;a href=\"early%20photography\"&gt;early photography&lt;/a&gt;. He was a &lt;a href=\"Daguerrotype\"&gt;Daguerrotypist&lt;/a&gt; from 1847 and a &lt;a href=\"Calotype\"&gt;Calotypist&lt;/a&gt; from 1849. In 1856 he was a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Photographic%20Society%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Photographic Society of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, of which he later became the President. He took numerous photographs, in particular, of &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Highland scenery&lt;/a&gt;, stalking and fishing. His work is now much sought after by collectors. \nMuseum exhibitions incorporating the works of Horatio Ross\nFamily.\nOn 26 December 1833 Ross married Justine Henrietta Macrae, the daughter of Colin Macrae of Inverinate. They had five sons, who inherited a fair share of their father's sporting prowess. Ross's way of life, though in many ways enviable and not conventionally extravagant, was not profitable and, as time went on, he found himself obliged to retrench.\nHe ended his days in the Scottish Highlands to which he had devoted so much of his life. He died at Rossie Lodge in &lt;a href=\"Inverness\"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; on 6 December 1886."
