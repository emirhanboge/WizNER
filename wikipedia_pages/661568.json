    "text": "Edward Wooster (1622 in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 July 8, 1689) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; early &lt;a href=\"settler\"&gt;settler&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20America\"&gt;Colonial America&lt;/a&gt;, and \"the first permanent settler in &lt;a href=\"Derby%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt;\", Connecticut.\nIn 1642, Wooster enters the record as one of the first colonists of &lt;a href=\"Milford%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Milford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. In 1651, he received permission to settle an area known as \"Paugusset\". In 1669, he was appointed &lt;a href=\"constable\"&gt;constable&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Paugusset\"&gt;Paugusset&lt;/a&gt;. He served the settlement in a variety of ways, but earned the nickname (and a bounty from the town) as the \"&lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; killer\" for helping to drive the predators out of the area. In 1659, he petitioned the court in &lt;a href=\"New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;New Haven&lt;/a&gt; for pay for the seven wolves he had killed in or near \"Paugassett\" which was what Derby was called at that point. Ironically, Wooster lived in the area at a time when the court in New Haven was still having concerns about the future of the area and considering possibly removing Wooster and anyone else in the area because of the failure to make progress on settling the area. \nEdward Wooster died on July 8, 1689.
