He played as centre or as wing.\nCareer.\nFormed in both rugby codes, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, he concluded his formation with the latter for &lt;a href=\"XIII%20Catalan\"&gt;XIII Catalan&lt;/a&gt;, with which he disputed his first senior matches. Outshined by the competition, he decided to join the nearby club &lt;a href=\"AS%20Saint-Est%C3%A8ve\"&gt;Saint-Est\u00e8ve&lt;/a&gt;, which he did for the rest of his career. He won the &lt;a href=\"French%20Rugby%20League%20Championship\"&gt;French Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, 1990 and 1993 as well the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Derby%20Cup\"&gt;Lord Derby Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1987 and 1993. Due to his club performances, he is selected several times for the &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;French national team&lt;/a&gt; between 1984 and 1991. \nAfter the end of his playing career, he also became the coach of Saint-Est\u00e8ve with the same success as he also won the French Championship title in 1997 and the Lord Derby Cup in 1994 and 1995.
