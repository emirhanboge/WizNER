    "text": "The 1926 Chatham Cup was the fourth annual nationwide knockout &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe competition was run on a regional basis, with five regional associations (Auckland, Wellington, Waikato, Canterbury, and Otago) each holding separate qualifying rounds. In all, 36 teams entered the 1926 competition, with the overwhelming majority being from the North Island.\nIn the South Auckland District there were four entries from Pukemiro, Huntly, Huntly Thistle and Frankton Railways. According to &lt;a href=\"Huntly%20Thistle%20AFC\"&gt;Huntly Thistle&lt;/a&gt;'s club website, the club beat Pukemiro 6-0 and Hikurangi 4-0 before losing to the eventual finalists North Shore 3-1. \nIn the Manawatu District there were four entries. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sox%20Manawatu\"&gt;St. Andrew's&lt;/a&gt;, Palmerston North R.S.A, Palmerston North Athletic and Rangers.\nOne unusual feature of the 1926 competition was that three of the four semi-finalist sides were composed largely of staff from three of the country's largest mental hospitals, at &lt;a href=\"Sunnyside%20Hospital\"&gt;Sunnyside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porirua%20Lunatic%20Asylum\"&gt;Porirua&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Seacliff%20Lunatic%20Asylum\"&gt;Seacliff&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeacliff was the single entry from Otago, and at an early stage there was discussion in regard to including the Dunedin side competing in the Wellington FA provincial rounds. This did not eventuate, and Seacliff were directly through to the South Island Final against Sunnyside.\nThere were four entries from North Auckland. Hikurangi, Waro Wanderers, Waro Corinthians and Y.M.C.A.(Whangarei).\nThe 1926 final.\nThe final was played at the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20Reserve\"&gt;Basin Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington, a change of venue from the previous finals which had been at &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Park\"&gt;Newtown Park&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Park%20%28Wellington%29\"&gt;Athletic Park&lt;/a&gt;. The following year the final briefly returned to Newtown Park, before making its permanent home at the Basin Reserve, a venue which was used regularly until the 1970s.\nIn the final, played in front of some 4000 spectators, Sunnyside's Archie Trotter became the first player to complete a Chatham Cup final &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt;. The match was high scoring, but contemporary reports suggest that many opportunities were missed by both teams. H. Pickering put Sunnyside in front after just seven minutes. Archie Trotter doubled the lead for Sunnyside before L. Hipkins scored for North Shore. After the half-time interval Trotter scored two further goals before John Woolley scored a late consolation for North Shore.\nOther notable features of the final included the appearance in the North Shore team of both Reg Baxter and &lt;a href=\"Ces%20Dacre\"&gt;Ces Dacre&lt;/a&gt;. Baxter was the first player to play for two different sides in Chatham Cup finals, having been part of the successful &lt;a href=\"Seacliff%20AFC\"&gt;Seacliff&lt;/a&gt; team in the &lt;a href=\"1923%20Chatham%20Cup\"&gt;1923 final&lt;/a&gt;. Dacre, while a fine player and New Zealand representative at football, is best remembered as one of New Zealand's foremost early &lt;a href=\"cricket%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cricketers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost- final at the weekly meeting of the Auckland Football Association in early September, the secretary, Mr. Dawson reported to the committee. The treatment by the New Zealand Council was praised, though the Wellington Football Association, in Dawson's opinion, had profiteered by insisting the payment of \u00a320 over and above the rent due to the Wellington City Council for use of the Basin Reserve.\nResults.\nQuarter-finals.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/STEP19260830.2.15\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"
