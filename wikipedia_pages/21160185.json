    "text": "India-Mongolia relations (; ), also knows as Indian-Mongolian relations or Indo-Mongolian relations, refers to bilateral relations between the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20India\"&gt;Republic of India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;. These relations are rapidly developing, with Indo-Mongolian cooperation formerly limited to diplomatic visits, provision of soft loans and financial aid and the collaborations in the IT sector, but enhanced in recent years by &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;'s 2015 visit to Ulaanbaatar, where the two Prime Ministers declared a \"strategic partnership\" between the two Asian democracies. \nIndia established diplomatic relations in December 1955. India was the first country outside the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt; to establish diplomatic relations with Mongolia. Since then, there have been treaties of mutual friendship and cooperation between the two countries in 1973, 1994, 2001 and 2004.\nMongolia supports India's candidature as a permanent member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; while India supported the inclusion of Mongolia as a full member of the &lt;a href=\"Non-Aligned%20Movement\"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to a 2010 &lt;a href=\"Gallup%20%28company%29\"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; poll, 26% of &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongolians&lt;/a&gt; approve of Indian leadership, with 9% disapproving and 66% uncertain. \nIn December 2016, Mongolia asked for financial help from India after the country's border with China was blocked.\nFollowing Indian External affairs minister &lt;a href=\"Sushma%20Swaraj\"&gt;Sushma Swaraj&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to Mongolia in April 2018, India &amp; Mongolia decided to establish an air-corridor to boost bilateral trade. It is also expected that construction of Mongolia's first ever oil refinery will commence in 2018 with technical &amp; financial assistance from India.\nHistorical relations.\nThere has been historical interaction between India and Mongolia for over 2,700 years.\nDelhi Sultanate.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Delhi%20Sultanate\"&gt;Delhi Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Turco-Mongol\"&gt;Turco-Mongol&lt;/a&gt; conqueror in Central Asia, &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the &lt;a href=\"Tughlaq\"&gt;Tughlaq&lt;/a&gt; Dynasty in the north Indian city of &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;. The Sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins, after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the &lt;a href=\"sayyid\"&gt;sayyid&lt;/a&gt;s, scholars, and the other Muslims; 100,000 war prisoners were put to death in one day.\nMughal Empire.\nIn 1526, &lt;a href=\"Babur\"&gt;Babur&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Timurid%20Dynasty\"&gt;Timurid&lt;/a&gt; descendant of &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Descent%20from%20Genghis%20Khan\"&gt;Genghis Khan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fergana%20Valley\"&gt;Fergana Valley&lt;/a&gt; (modern day &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;), swept across the &lt;a href=\"Khyber%20Pass\"&gt;Khyber Pass&lt;/a&gt; and established the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt;, covering modern day &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. However, his son &lt;a href=\"Humayun\"&gt;Humayun&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Afghans\"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; warrior &lt;a href=\"Sher%20Shah%20Suri\"&gt;Sher Shah Suri&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. After Sher Shah's death, his son &lt;a href=\"Islam%20Shah%20Suri\"&gt;Islam Shah Suri&lt;/a&gt; and the Hindu king &lt;a href=\"Hemu\"&gt;Hemu&lt;/a&gt;, who had won 22 battles against Afghan rebels and forces of Akbar, from &lt;a href=\"Punjab%20region\"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and had established a secular &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; rule in North India from &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; till 1556. &lt;a href=\"Akbar\"&gt;Akbar&lt;/a&gt;'s forces defeated and killed &lt;a href=\"Hemu\"&gt;Hemu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Panipat%20%281556%29\"&gt;Second Battle of Panipat&lt;/a&gt; on 6 November 1556.\nThe Mughal dynasty ruled most of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt; by 1600; it went into a slow decline after 1707. The Mughals suffered a severe blow due to invasions from &lt;a href=\"Maratha%20Empire\"&gt;Marathas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Afghans&lt;/a&gt; due to which the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20emperors\"&gt;Mughal dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were reduced to &lt;a href=\"puppet%20ruler\"&gt;puppet ruler&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Plassey\"&gt;1757&lt;/a&gt;. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were finally defeated and taken over by the &lt;a href=\"British%20people\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857\"&gt;Indian Rebellion of 1857&lt;/a&gt;, also called the 1857 War of Independence. As the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; took over the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20dynasty\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; was ended.\nThe Mughals were perhaps the richest single dynasty to have ever existed. During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces consisted of the Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states - including the &lt;a href=\"Maratha%20Empire\"&gt;Maratha Empire&lt;/a&gt; - which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals, while often employing brutal tactics to subjugate their empire, had a policy of integration with Indian culture, which is what made them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. &lt;a href=\"Akbar\"&gt;Akbar&lt;/a&gt; the Great was particularly famed for this. Akbar declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the \"&lt;a href=\"jizya\"&gt;jizya&lt;/a&gt;\" tax for &lt;a href=\"dhimmi\"&gt;non-Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local \"&lt;a href=\"maharajas\"&gt;maharajas&lt;/a&gt;\", and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20architecture\"&gt;Indo-Saracenic architecture&lt;/a&gt;. It was the erosion of this tradition coupled with increased brutality and &lt;a href=\"centralization\"&gt;centralization&lt;/a&gt; that played a large part in the dynasty's downfall after &lt;a href=\"Aurangzeb\"&gt;Aurangzeb&lt;/a&gt;, who unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively non-pluralistic policies on the general population, which often inflamed the majority &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; population.\nCultural exchanges.\nBuddhism.\n&lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; was carried to Mongolia by Indian missionaries during the early Christian era. As a result, today, Buddhists form the single largest religious denomination in Mongolia.\nBuddhists entered the service of Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Buddhist monasteries established in Karakorum were granted tax exempt status, though the religion was not given official status by the Mongols until later. All variants of Buddhism, such as &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Buddhism\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Buddhism\"&gt;Indian Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; flourished, though Tibetan Buddhism was eventually favored at the imperial level under emperor &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6ngke%20Khan\"&gt;M\u00f6ngke&lt;/a&gt;, who appointed Namo from &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; as chief of all Buddhist monks.\nOgedei's son and Guyuk's younger brother, Khoten, became the governor of &lt;a href=\"Ningxia\"&gt;Ningxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gansu\"&gt;Gansu&lt;/a&gt;. He launched a military campaign into &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Generals Lichi and Dhordha, and the marauding Mongols burned down Tibetan monuments such as the Reting monastery and the Gyal temple in 1240. Prince K\u00f6t\u00f6n was convinced that no power in the world exceeded the might of the Mongols. However, he also believed that religion was necessary in the interests of the next life. Thus he invited &lt;a href=\"Sakya%20Pandita\"&gt;Sakya Pandita&lt;/a&gt; to his ordo. Prince K\u00f6t\u00f6n was impressed and healed by Sakya Pandita's teachings and knowledge, and later became the first known &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; prince of Mongol empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Kublai%20Khan\"&gt;Kublai Khan&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Dynasty\"&gt;Yuan Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, also favored Buddhism. As early as the 1240s, he made contacts with a &lt;a href=\"Zen\"&gt;Chan&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist monk Haiyun, who became his Buddhist adviser. Kublai's second son, whom he later officially designated as his successor in the Yuan Dynasty, was given a Chinese name \"&lt;a href=\"Zhenjin\"&gt;Zhenjin&lt;/a&gt;\" (literally, \"True Gold\") by Haiyun. &lt;a href=\"Khatun\"&gt;Khatun&lt;/a&gt; Chabi influenced Kublai to be converted to Buddhism, as she had received the H\u00e9vajra tantra initiations from &lt;a href=\"Drog%C3%B6n%20Ch%C3%B6gyal%20Phagpa\"&gt;Phagspa&lt;/a&gt; and been impressed. Kublai appointed Phagspa his state preceptor, and later imperial preceptor, giving him power over all the Buddhist monks within the territory of the Yuan Dynasty. For the rest of the Yuan Dynasty in Mongolia and China, until the Mongols were overthrown in 1368, Tibetan lamas were the most influential Buddhist clergy. Via the Tibetan clergy, Indian Buddhist textual tradition strongly influenced the religious life in the Empire.\nSome of the Ilkhans in Iran held Paghmo gru-pa order as their appanage in Tibet and lavishly patronized a variety of Indian, Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist monks. But in 1295, &lt;a href=\"Ghazan\"&gt;Ghazan&lt;/a&gt; persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their temples. Before his conversion to Islam though, he had built a Buddhist temple in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Khorasan\"&gt;Khorasan&lt;/a&gt;. The 14th century Buddhist scriptures found at archaeological sites related to Chagatai Khanate show the popularity of Buddhism among the Mongols and the Uighurs. &lt;a href=\"Tokhta\"&gt;Tokhta&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt; also encouraged &lt;a href=\"lama\"&gt;lama&lt;/a&gt;s to settle in Russia, but his policy was halted by his &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; successor &lt;a href=\"Ozbeg%20Khan\"&gt;Ozbeg Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern times.\nIndia established formal diplomatic relations with Mongolia on December 24, 1955 thereby becoming the first country outside the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20bloc\"&gt;Soviet bloc&lt;/a&gt; to establish diplomatic relations with the country. Since then, there have been numerous diplomatic visits and interactions between the two countries. India sponsored Mongolia's candidacy for membership of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; in 1961 despite opposition from &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and in 1973, Mongolia reciprocated to the Indian gesture by becoming the second country after &lt;a href=\"Bhutan\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt; to recognise &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; as an independent country following the &lt;a href=\"liberation%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;liberation of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; by Indian troops.\nJoint Declaration of 1973.\nA path-breaking Indo-Mongolian joint declaration was signed in February 1973 during the Indian visit of the Mongolian Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Yumjaagiin%20Tsedenbal\"&gt;Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation (1994).\nA treaty of friendly relations and cooperation was signed in February 1994 during the visit of the then Mongolian president &lt;a href=\"Punsalmaagiin%20Ochirbat\"&gt;Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat&lt;/a&gt;, to India.\nAs per the provisions of the treaty, India and Mongolia resolved to develop cooperation in trade and economy, science, health, agriculture, culture, education, communication and tourism. They also resolved to work closely to ensure security and curbing international crimes and terrorism.\n2001-present.\nIn January 2001, the Mongolian president &lt;a href=\"Natsagiin%20Bagabandi\"&gt;Natsagiin Bagabandi&lt;/a&gt; visited India. During this visit, a Joint Declaration was issued and a series of six major agreements were signed in order to promote cooperation in the fields of Information Technology, Investment Promotion and Protection and mutual legal assistance in civil, criminal and commercial matters. Mongolia conveyed its support to India's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and also indicated its support for India's peace efforts with &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mongolian prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Nambaryn%20Enkhbayar\"&gt;Nambaryn Enkhbayar&lt;/a&gt; visited India in January 2004. During this visit, three agreements were signed in order to promote mutual cooperation in the fields of Animal Health and Dairy, Space Science and biotechnology.\nIndia offered a &lt;a href=\"soft%20loan\"&gt;soft loan&lt;/a&gt; of US$25 million to improve its infrastructure. Proposals for an Atal Bihari Vajpayee Centre for Excellence in Information Technology and Communication Technology in the Mongolian capital &lt;a href=\"Ulaan%20Baatar\"&gt;Ulaan Baatar&lt;/a&gt; were formalized during this visit. The Foundation of IT Center was laid by Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt; on May 17, 2015. A Mongolian-run Buddhist monastery was established in the historic city of &lt;a href=\"Bodh%20Gaya\"&gt;Bodh Gaya&lt;/a&gt; and its foundation stone was laid by Enkhbayar.\nIndo-Mongolian relations have been growing ever since it was resolved to elevate ties to a \"new level of partnership\" during the India visit of Mongolian President Enkhbayar. India provides technical and economic cooperation to Mongolia in the fields of higher education, agriculture, information and communication technology and human resource development. Prime Minister of India &lt;a href=\"Narendra%20Modi\"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt; visited Mongolia on 16 May 2015, where he also addressed the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Mongolia\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. He also handed over Bhabhatron equipment to the National Cancer Centre in Mongolian capital &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Bator\"&gt;Ulan Bator&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to in May 2015, a $1 Billion line of credit was extended to Mongolia, for infrastructure development, amongst many other fields.\nIn early 2021, India stepped up on the COVID-19 vaccine distribution to several countries, including Mongolia, to mitigate some of the delays by the WHO. India donated 13 boxes (150k doses) of the COVID-19 vaccine to Mongolia, making it one of the first 25 countries to receive the vaccine from India. During the donation ceremony, Ambassador of India to Mongolia M P Singh noted the importance of Mongolia for India\u2019s Act East policy as a strategic partner and \u2018spiritual neighbour.\u2019\nRecent\nRecently, India and Mongolia have reviewed bilateral cooperation in hydrocarbons and steel sectors."
