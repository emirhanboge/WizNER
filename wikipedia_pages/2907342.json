    "text": "The Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge (MVNWR) is a protected &lt;a href=\"wildlife%20refuge\"&gt;wildlife refuge&lt;/a&gt; administered by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Warm%20Springs%20Natural%20Area\"&gt;Warm Springs Natural Area&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moapa%20Valley\"&gt;Moapa Valley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clark%20County%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Clark County, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. The refuge is east of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Valley\"&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt; and northeast of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe refuge was created as part of the larger &lt;a href=\"Desert%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20Complex\"&gt;Desert National Wildlife Refuge Complex&lt;/a&gt;, on September 10, 1979. The Desert National Wildlife Refuge complex also includes the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Meadows%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Desert National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pahranagat%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOne of the areas of the MVNWR, now called the \"Plummer Unit,\" was a public, family-owned recreational park. A former general manager of the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Bob Plummer, purchased a parcel of land with an &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;oasis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Washingtonia%20filifera\"&gt;California Fan Palm&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Washingtonia filifera\") and natural &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt;s. It became known as \"Desert Oasis Warm Springs.\" During the 1970s and 80's he converted the property into a spa, resort and retreat enjoyed for over several decades by Las Vegas area families, with fond memories at the \"Jewel in the Desert\". By 1990 the resort changed from an open-to-the-public venue into a private time-share spa.\nThe Desert Oasis Warm Springs Resort continued to operate until a wildfire swept through the area in 1994. After the fire, the resort remained unused until 1997 when the property was purchased by &lt;a href=\"Del%20Webb\"&gt;Del Webb Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, turned over to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and incorporated as part of the Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge.\nMoapa dace fish.\nThe refuge was established to provide and protect the &lt;a href=\"habitat\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moapa%20dace\"&gt;Moapa dace&lt;/a&gt; of which about 1,900 exist in the &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20River%20%28Nevada%29\"&gt;Muddy River&lt;/a&gt; area. The habitat on the refuge consists of stream channels feeding the Muddy River including six &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt;s emerging near the center of the refuge.\nSince the 1990s the dace have been in decline mainly due to &lt;a href=\"habitat%20destruction\"&gt;habitat destruction&lt;/a&gt; and modification. Nearby groundwater pumping has decreased stream discharge and streamflows and decreased dace habitat. Competition with &lt;a href=\"introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced species&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Gambusia%20affinis\"&gt;mosquitofish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poecilia%20mexicana\"&gt;shortfin molly&lt;/a&gt; have also added to the dace's decline.\nIn August, 2005 the &lt;a href=\"National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20Association\"&gt;National Wildlife Refuge Association&lt;/a&gt; and again in September, 2005 the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Wildlife\"&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; listed the Refuge as one of the 10 most endangered refuges in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;."
