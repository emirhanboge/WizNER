    "text": "Kharitonov's theorem is a result used in &lt;a href=\"control%20theory\"&gt;control theory&lt;/a&gt; to assess the &lt;a href=\"stability%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"dynamical%20system\"&gt;dynamical system&lt;/a&gt; when the physical parameters of the system are not known precisely. When the coefficients of the &lt;a href=\"characteristic%20polynomial\"&gt;characteristic polynomial&lt;/a&gt; are known, the &lt;a href=\"Routh%E2%80%93Hurwitz%20stability%20criterion\"&gt;Routh\u2013Hurwitz stability criterion&lt;/a&gt; can be used to check if the system is stable (i.e. if all &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s have negative real parts). Kharitonov's theorem can be used in the case where the coefficients are only known to be within specified ranges. It provides a test of stability for a so-called &lt;a href=\"interval%20polynomial\"&gt;interval polynomial&lt;/a&gt;, while Routh\u2013Hurwitz is concerned with an ordinary &lt;a href=\"polynomial\"&gt;polynomial&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinition.\nAn interval polynomial is the family of all polynomials\nwhere each coefficient formula_2 can take any value in the specified intervals\nIt is also assumed that the leading coefficient cannot be zero: formula_4.\nTheorem.\nAn interval polynomial is stable (i.e. all members of the family are stable) if and only if the four so-called Kharitonov polynomials\nare stable.\nWhat is somewhat surprising about Kharitonov's result is that although in principle we are testing an infinite number of polynomials for stability, in fact we need to test only four. This we can do using Routh\u2013Hurwitz or any other method. So it only takes four times more work to be informed about the stability of an interval polynomial than it takes to test one ordinary polynomial for stability.\nKharitonov's theorem is useful in the field of &lt;a href=\"robust%20control\"&gt;robust control&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to design systems that will work well despite uncertainties in component behavior due to &lt;a href=\"measurement%20error\"&gt;measurement error&lt;/a&gt;s, changes in operating conditions, equipment wear and so on."
