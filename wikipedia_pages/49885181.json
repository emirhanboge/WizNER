    "text": "Derr Run is a &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Muncy%20Creek\"&gt;Little Muncy Creek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lycoming County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through &lt;a href=\"Penn%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Penn Township&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Township%2C%20Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Franklin Township&lt;/a&gt;. The watershed of the stream has an area of . It is classified as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.\nCourse.\nDerr Run begins in a small &lt;a href=\"pond\"&gt;pond&lt;/a&gt; on a hill in Penn Township. It flows south for several tenths of a mile and enters a valley before turning south-southeast. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns south for a few tenths of a mile before turning south-southeast again and entering Penn Township. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it turns southeast for several tenths of a mile. The stream then leaves its valley, crosses &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Route%20118\"&gt;Pennsylvania Route 118&lt;/a&gt;, and turns southwest, flowing through the valley of Little Muncy Creek. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with Little Muncy Creek.\nDerr Run joins Little Muncy Creek upstream of its mouth.\nGeography and geology.\nThe elevation near the &lt;a href=\"river%20mouth\"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt; of Derr Run is above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation of the stream's &lt;a href=\"river%20source\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; is above sea level.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrology%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; in the watershed of Derr Run.\nWatershed and biology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; of Derr Run has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Geological%20Survey\"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; quadrangle of Lairdsville. However, its source is in the &lt;a href=\"quadrangle%20%28geography%29\"&gt;quadrangle&lt;/a&gt; of Picture Rocks. The mouth of the stream is located within of &lt;a href=\"Lairdsville%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lairdsville&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2014, Waste Management of Pennsylvania, Inc. was issued an Erosion and Sediment Control Permit for which the receiving waterbody is Derr Run. In 2007, the US Gypsum Company was issued a permit to build, maintain, and operate a long &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; pipeline crossing the stream in two places, as well as crossing other streams. However, one of the crossings of Derr Run was planned to involve no impact to the stream; the other was planned to impact .\nDerr Run is classified as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, as are all of the other named tributaries of Little Muncy Creek.\nHistory.\nDerr Run was entered into the &lt;a href=\"Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System\"&gt;Geographic Names Information System&lt;/a&gt; on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1192351."
