    "text": "Alice Springs () is the third-largest town in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Known as Stuart until 31 August 1933, the name Alice Springs was given by surveyor &lt;a href=\"William%20Mills%20%28surveyor%29\"&gt;William Whitfield Mills&lt;/a&gt; after Alice, Lady Todd (\"n\u00e9e\" Alice Gillam Bell), wife of the telegraph pioneer Sir &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Todd%20%28pioneer%29\"&gt;Charles Todd&lt;/a&gt;. Known colloquially as The Alice or simply Alice, the town is situated roughly in Australia's geographic centre. It is nearly &lt;a href=\"equidistant\"&gt;equidistant&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area is known as to its &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;original inhabitants&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arrernte%20people\"&gt;Arrernte&lt;/a&gt;, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around what is now Alice Springs for tens of thousands of years.\nAlice Springs had an urban population of 26,534 in June 2018, having declined an average of 1.16% per year the preceding five years. The town's population accounts for approximately 10 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory.\nThe town straddles the usually dry &lt;a href=\"Todd%20River\"&gt;Todd River&lt;/a&gt; on the northern side of the &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Ranges\"&gt;MacDonnell Ranges&lt;/a&gt;. The surrounding region is known as Central Australia, or the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Centre\"&gt;Red Centre&lt;/a&gt;, an arid environment consisting of several deserts. Temperatures in Alice Springs can vary, with an average maximum in summer of and an average minimum in winter of .\nHistory.\nTraditional owners.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arrernte%20people\"&gt;Arrernte&lt;/a&gt; people are the traditional owners of the Alice Springs area and surrounding &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Ranges\"&gt;MacDonnell Ranges&lt;/a&gt;. They have lived in the area for at least 30,000 years. The traditional name for the township area is \"Mparntwe\".\nTheir name has been spelt in various forms, including Aranda, Arrarnta, and Arunta. There are five dialects of the Arrernte language: South-eastern, Central, Northern, Eastern and North-eastern.\nArrernte country is rich with mountain ranges, waterholes and gorges, which create a variety of natural habitats. According to Arrernte traditional histories, the landscape was shaped by the Yeperenye, Ntyarlke, Utnerrengatye caterpillars and Akngwelye or wild dogs.\nThe numerous sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs include Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat Hill), Ntaripe (&lt;a href=\"Heavitree%20Gap\"&gt;Heavitree Gap&lt;/a&gt;), Atnelkentyarliweke (&lt;a href=\"Anzac%20Hill\"&gt;Anzac Hill&lt;/a&gt;) and Alhekulyele (Mt Gillen).\nEuropean settlement.\nIn 1861\u201362, &lt;a href=\"John%20McDouall%20Stuart\"&gt;John McDouall Stuart&lt;/a&gt; led an expedition through Central Australia, to the west of what later became Alice Springs, thereby establishing a route from the south of the continent to the north.\nA settlement named after Stuart was necessitated ten years later with the construction of a repeater station on the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Overland%20Telegraph%20Line\"&gt;Australian Overland Telegraph Line&lt;/a&gt; (OTL), which linked &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. The OTL was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart's route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. The &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Springs%20Telegraph%20Station\"&gt;Alice Springs Telegraph Station&lt;/a&gt; was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry &lt;a href=\"Todd%20River\"&gt;Todd River&lt;/a&gt;, named Alice Springs by W.W. Mills after the wife of the Superintendent of Telegraphs and Postmaster General of South Australia, Sir &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Todd%20%28pioneer%29\"&gt;Charles Todd&lt;/a&gt;, who was the driving force for constructing the OTL. The nearby settlement of Stuart was renamed as Alice Springs on 31 August 1933. The Todd River and its tributary the Charles River, which meet near the telegraph station, were named after Sir Charles.\nIt was not until &lt;a href=\"Alluvium\"&gt;alluvial&lt;/a&gt; gold was discovered at Arltunga, east of the present Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant European settlement occurred. The town's first substantial building was the &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Town%20Gaol\"&gt;Stuart Town Gaol&lt;/a&gt; in Parson's Street; this was built in 1909, when the town had a European population of fewer than 20 people. Many of the gaol's first prisoners were first-contact aboriginal men incarcerated for killing cattle. The first aircraft, piloted by &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Stewart%20Briggs\"&gt;Francis Stewart Briggs&lt;/a&gt; landed in 1921. Central Australia's first hospital, Adelaide House, was built in 1926 when the European population of the town was about 40. It was not until 1929, when the train line to Alice was built, that the town's European population began to grow. Aboriginal Centralians outnumbered European Centralians until the mid-1930s. From 1926 to 1931, Alice Springs was the seat of government for the now-defunct &lt;a href=\"Central%20Australia%20%28territory%29\"&gt;Territory of Central Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Until 31 August 1933, the town was officially known as Stuart.\nThe original mode of British-Australian transportation in the outback were &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt; trains, operated by immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Pashtun%20people\"&gt;Pathan&lt;/a&gt; tribes in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20history%20of%20the%20North-West%20Frontier\"&gt;North-West Frontier&lt;/a&gt; of then-&lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt; (present-day Pakistan), known locally as &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; cameleers based at Hergott Springs, or Marree as it is now known. Many cameleers moved to Alice Springs in 1929 when the railway finally reached the town. They lived on the block where the town council is now, transporting goods from the rail head to stations and settlements to the north. A gold rush in Tennant Creek in 1932 kept the wheels of the Alice Springs economy turning until the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlice Springs was connected to Darwin by rail on 4 February 2004, when &lt;a href=\"The%20Ghan\"&gt;the first passenger train&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Darwin from Adelaide.\nWorld War II.\n&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; brought significant changes to Alice Springs. Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an extremely isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No.\u00a09 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. The railway hub in Alice Springs was taken over by military operations and the number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs grew rapidly, as did the number of personnel passing through on their way to and from Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes\u2014the Northern Territory capital's primary means of transportation and resupply\u2014were cut off. The evacuation of Darwin first brought a large number of civilians including elected officials and many of the territory government's records. Alice Springs became the war-time civilian capital of the Northern Territory. When Darwin was bombed by Japanese air forces, a large number of military personnel and their heavy equipment were rapidly moved south to Alice Springs.\nThe number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs peaked at around 8,000 and the number of personnel passing through totalled close to 200,000. Once the war ended, the military camps and the evacuees departed, and Alice Springs' population declined rapidly. After being visited by nearly 200,000 people, including the American General &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20MacArthur\"&gt;Douglas MacArthur&lt;/a&gt;, Alice Springs gained considerable fame. The war years also left behind many structures. The historically-listed &lt;a href=\"Totem%20Theatre\"&gt;Totem Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, created for the entertainment of this camp, still exists today. The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Army\"&gt;Australian Army&lt;/a&gt; set up the 109th Australian General Hospital at Alice Springs. &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Springs%20Airport\"&gt;Seven Mile Aerodrome&lt;/a&gt; was constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. War-related operations necessitated the first sealing of the road between Alice Springs and Larrimah, expansion and improvement of Alice Springs' water supply, and improving the rail head. The war-related operations left behind thousands of pieces of excess military equipment and vehicles, and a marked increase in Alice Springs' population.\nDuring World War II, Alice Springs was the location of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20RAAF%20inland%20aircraft%20fuel%20depots\"&gt;RAAF No. 24 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot&lt;/a&gt; (IAFD), completed on 20 May 1942 and closed in November 1944. Each usually consisting of four tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the &lt;a href=\"RAAF\"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"US%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;US Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;, at a total cost of \u00a3900,000 ($1,800,000).\nAfter World War II.\nDuring the 1960s Alice Springs became an important defence location with the development of the US/Australian &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Gap\"&gt;Pine Gap&lt;/a&gt; joint defence &lt;a href=\"satellite\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; monitoring base, home to about 700 workers from both countries.\nBy far the major industry in recent times is tourism. Almost in the exact centre of the continent, Alice Springs is some from the nearest ocean and from the nearest major cities, Darwin and Adelaide. Alice Springs is at the midpoint of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ghan\"&gt;Adelaide\u2013Darwin Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern town.\nThe modern town of Alice Springs has both European and Aboriginal influences. The town's focal point, the &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Mall\"&gt;Todd Mall&lt;/a&gt;, hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs' desert lifestyle has inspired several unique events, such as the Camel Cup, the &lt;a href=\"Henley-on-Todd%20Regatta\"&gt;Henley-on-Todd Regatta&lt;/a&gt;, Beanie Festival and the Tatts Finke Desert Race.\nBuilt environment.\nAlice Springs has many historic buildings, including the &lt;a href=\"Overland%20Telegraph\"&gt;Overland Telegraph Station&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Courthouse and &lt;a href=\"The%20Residency%2C%20Alice%20Springs\"&gt;Residency&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hartley%20Street%20School\"&gt;Hartley Street School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20House%20%28Alice%20Springs%29\"&gt;Adelaide House&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful stone building in the middle of the Mall, Central Australia's first hospital, was designed and built by the Rev. John Flynn, founder of the world's first flying doctor service, in 1926. It was also the site of the world's first successful portable wireless radio experiment conducted by Alf Traeger. Today it is a museum, one of several significant tourist attractions which form part of 'The Flynn Trail' a self-guided urban heritage trail.\nToday, the town is an important tourist hub and service centre for the surrounding area. It is a well-appointed town for its size, with several large hotels, a world-class convention centre, and a good range of visitor attractions, restaurants, and other services.\nGeography.\nThe region around Alice Springs is part of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Ranges%20xeric%20scrub\"&gt;Central Ranges xeric scrub&lt;/a&gt; area of dry scrubby grassland and includes the &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Ranges\"&gt;MacDonnell Ranges&lt;/a&gt; which run east and west of the town and contain a number of hiking trails and swimming holes such as &lt;a href=\"Ormiston%20Gorge\"&gt;Ormiston Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, Ormiston Gorge Creek, Red Bank Gorge and &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Helen%20Gorge\"&gt;Glen Helen Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Larapinta%20Trail\"&gt;Larapinta Trail&lt;/a&gt; follows the West MacDonnell Ranges and is considered among the world's great walking experiences.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Simpson%20Desert\"&gt;Simpson Desert&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of Alice Springs is one of Australia's great wilderness areas containing giant, red sand dunes and rock formations such as &lt;a href=\"Chambers%20Pillar\"&gt;Chambers Pillar&lt;/a&gt; and Rainbow Valley.\nClimate.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;, Alice Springs has a subtropical &lt;a href=\"hot%20desert%20climate\"&gt;hot desert climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"BWh\"), featuring extremely hot, dry summers and short, mild winters. Located just south of the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Capricorn\"&gt;Tropic of Capricorn&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Alice Springs straddles the usually dry &lt;a href=\"Todd%20River\"&gt;Todd River&lt;/a&gt; on the northern side of the &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Ranges\"&gt;MacDonnell Ranges&lt;/a&gt;. Alice Springs is located in Central Australia, also called the Red Centre, an arid environment consisting of several different deserts. The annual average rainfall is which would make it a &lt;a href=\"semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; except that its high &lt;a href=\"evapotranspiration\"&gt;evapotranspiration&lt;/a&gt;, or its aridity, makes it a &lt;a href=\"desert%20climate\"&gt;desert climate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnnual precipitation is erratic, varying year to year in Alice Springs. In 2001 fell and in 2002 only fell. The highest daily rainfall is , recorded on 31 March 1988.\nTemperatures in Alice Springs vary widely, and rainfall can vary quite dramatically from year to year. In summer, the average maximum temperature is in the mid-30s, whereas in winter the average minimum temperature can be , with an average of 12.4 nights below freezing every year, providing &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation of the town is about , which contributes to the cool nights in winter. The highest temperature on record is first recorded on 24 December 1891, whilst the record low is , recorded on 17 July 1976. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the Northern Territory.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232016\"&gt;2016 census&lt;/a&gt; of population, there were 23,726 people in the Alice Springs Urban Area.\nAboriginal population.\nAs Alice Springs is the regional hub of Central Australia, it attracts Aboriginal people from all over that region and well beyond. Many Aboriginal people visit regularly to use the town's services. Aboriginal residents usually live in the suburbs, on special purpose leases (or town camps), or further out at &lt;a href=\"Amoonguna\"&gt;Amoonguna&lt;/a&gt; to the south and on the small family outstation communities on Aboriginal lands in surrounding areas.\nThe traditional owners of the Alice Springs area are the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Arrernte\"&gt;Central Arrernte&lt;/a&gt; people. As it is the largest town in central Australia, there are also speakers of &lt;a href=\"Warlpiri%20language\"&gt;Warlpiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warumungu%20language\"&gt;Warumungu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaytetye%20language\"&gt;Kaytetye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alyawarre\"&gt;Alyawarre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luritja\"&gt;Luritja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pintupi\"&gt;Pintupi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pitjantjatjara%20language\"&gt;Pitjantjatjara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yankunytjatjara%20language\"&gt;Yankunytjatjara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ngaanyatjarra\"&gt;Ngaanyatjarra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pertame\"&gt;Pertame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Arrernte\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Arrernte\"&gt;Western Arrernte&lt;/a&gt; among others.\nForeign and itinerant populations.\nAmerican population.\n&lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; have lived in Alice Springs continuously since the establishment of the United States Air Force Detachment\u00a0421, in 1954. Currently located on Schwarz Crescent, it is part of a joint American\u2013Australian project called the Joint Geological and Geographical Research Station (JGGRS). The unit is locally known as \"Det 421\" or \"The Det\" and has sponsored as many as 25 American families to live as temporary residents of the Alice Springs district.\nTo mark the longstanding friendship with the community, on 1 July 1995, the Alice Springs Town Council granted Detachment\u00a0421 freedom of entry to Alice Springs. Since the early 1970s, the majority of the American population in Alice Springs has been associated with proximity to &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Gap\"&gt;Pine Gap&lt;/a&gt;, a joint Australian-US satellite tracking station, located south-west of Alice Springs, that employs about 700 Americans and Australians.\nCurrently, 2,000 residents of the Alice Springs district hold American citizenship. Many of these, joined by some Australians, celebrate major American public holidays, including the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;4th of July&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;. Americans in Alice Springs are also known to participate in a variety of associations and sporting teams, including baseball, basketball and soccer competitions.\nOther cultures.\nSeveral small immigrant communities of other foreign cultures have found a home in Alice Springs, including Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Sudanese and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20people\"&gt;Indian ethnic groups&lt;/a&gt;. The most obvious impact of their presence in such a small and isolated town has been the opening of various restaurants serving their traditional cuisines.\nItinerant population.\nAlice Springs has a large &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aitinerant\"&gt;itinerant&lt;/a&gt; population. This population is generally composed of foreign and Australian tourists, Aboriginal Australians visiting from nearby &lt;a href=\"Central%20Australia\"&gt;Central Australia&lt;/a&gt;n communities, and Australian or international workers on short-term contracts (colloquially referred to as \"blow-ins\"). The major sources of work that recruit workers into town are the stations, mines, healthcare and law enforcement. Foreign tourists usually pass through on their way to &lt;a href=\"Uluru-Kata%20Tjuta%20National%20Park\"&gt;Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Australian tourists usually come through as a part of an event such as the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20Games\"&gt;Masters Games&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Finke%20Desert%20Race\"&gt;Finke Desert Race&lt;/a&gt;. These events can cause the population of the town to fluctuate by several thousand within a matter of days.\nGovernment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Springs%20Town%20Council\"&gt;Alice Springs Town Council&lt;/a&gt; governs the Alice Springs area, which takes in the town centre, its suburbs and some rural area. The Alice Springs Town Council has governed Alice Springs since 1971. The Alice Springs council consists of nine members: the mayor and eight &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt;. The town is not divided up into wards. The current mayor of Alice Springs is Damien Ryan. Council Meetings are held on the last Monday of each month. The &lt;a href=\"Central%20Australia\"&gt;Alice Springs Region&lt;/a&gt; is governed by the newly created &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Region\"&gt;MacDonnell Region&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"local%20government%20area\"&gt;local government area&lt;/a&gt;, for which Alice Springs serves as council seat.\nAlice Springs and the surrounding region have four elected members to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Northern Territory Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20division%20of%20Araluen\"&gt;Araluen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20division%20of%20Braitling\"&gt;Braitling&lt;/a&gt; are entirely within Alice Springs, while the mostly rural seats of &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20division%20of%20Gwoja\"&gt;Gwoja&lt;/a&gt; (known as &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20division%20of%20Stuart\"&gt;Stuart&lt;/a&gt; before 2020) and &lt;a href=\"electoral%20division%20of%20Namatjira\"&gt;Namatjira&lt;/a&gt; spill into the town. Historically, Alice Springs has tilted conservative. It was a stronghold for the &lt;a href=\"Country%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Country Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; for many years; only the northeast (part of which is in Stuart) leans &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;. However, these trends were dramatically altered at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Northern%20Territory%20general%20election\"&gt;2016 election&lt;/a&gt;. Former Chief Minister and Alice Springs resident &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Giles\"&gt;Adam Giles&lt;/a&gt; lost Braitling to Labor, Araluen was retained by CLP-turned-independent &lt;a href=\"Robyn%20Lambley\"&gt;Robyn Lambley&lt;/a&gt;, and Namatjira and Stuart fell to Labor. As a result, the CLP was completely shut out of Alice Springs for the first time ever. The CLP regained Braitling and Namatjira in 2020, while Lambley retained Araluen for her new party, the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20Alliance\"&gt;Territory Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, Alice Springs is part of the &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Lingiari\"&gt;Division of Lingiari&lt;/a&gt;, which includes all of the Territory outside the Darwin/Palmerston area. Lingiari is currently held by Labor member and Alice Springs resident &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Snowdon\"&gt;Warren Snowdon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nAlice Springs began as a service town to the pastoral industry that first came to the region. The introduction of the rail line increased its economy. Today the town services a region of and a regional population of 38,749. The region includes a number of mining and pastoral communities, the Joint Defence Space Research Facility at &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Gap\"&gt;Pine Gap&lt;/a&gt; and tourist attractions at &lt;a href=\"Uluru-Kata%20Tjuta%20National%20Park\"&gt;Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watarrka%20National%20Park\"&gt;Watarrka National Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"MacDonnell%20Ranges\"&gt;MacDonnell Ranges&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe largest employer in Alice Springs is the Northern Territory Government, with 8% of employed people working in government administration, 7% in school education, and 4% in the Alice Springs Hospital. The economy of Alice Springs is somewhat reliant on domestic and international tourism, with 4% of its workforce employed providing accommodation. \nAs well as Territory Discoveries, all major tour companies have a base in Alice Springs, including AAT Kings &amp; APT, as well as numerous local operators, including Emu Run Tours, Anganu Waai! tours, Alice Wanderer and Wayoutback Desert Safaris, the only locally based Advanced &lt;a href=\"Ecotourism\"&gt;Ecotourism&lt;/a&gt; Accredited operator.\nAlice Springs is home to numerous hotels, from the -star &lt;a href=\"Lasseters%20Hotel%20Casino\"&gt;Lasseters Hotel Casino&lt;/a&gt;, to backpacker hostels. There are also caravan parks.\nA dispatch centre for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia&lt;/a&gt; operates here.\nEducation.\nEducation is overseen territory-wide by the Department of Education and Training (DET). It works to continually improve education outcomes for all students, with a focus on Indigenous students.\nPreschool, primary and secondary.\nAlice Springs is served by nineteen public and private schools that cater to local and overseas students. Over 3,843 primary and secondary students are enrolled in schools in Alice Springs, with 2,187 students attending primary education, and 1,656 students attending secondary education. There are over 1,932 students enrolled in government schools and 1,055 students enrolled in independent schools.\n&lt;a href=\"Alice%20Springs%20School%20of%20the%20Air\"&gt;Alice Springs School of the Air&lt;/a&gt; delivers education to students in remote areas.\nTertiary and vocational.\nThe Alice Springs Campus of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin%20University\"&gt;Charles Darwin University&lt;/a&gt; offers courses in &lt;a href=\"TAFE\"&gt;TAFE&lt;/a&gt; and higher education. The Centre for Appropriate Technology was established in 1980 and provides a range of services to encourage and help Aboriginal people enhance their quality of life in remote communities.\nRecreation and culture.\nEvents and festivals.\nThe town's focal point, the &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Mall\"&gt;Todd Mall&lt;/a&gt;, hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs' desert lifestyle has inspired several unique events, such as the Alice Desert Festival, the Red Centre NATS, Blacken Open Air music festival, &lt;a href=\"Parrtjima\"&gt;Parrtjima&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Camel%20Cup\"&gt;Camel Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Henley-on-Todd%20Regatta\"&gt;Henley-on-Todd Regatta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Beanie%20Festival\"&gt;Beanie Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Finke%20Desert%20Race\"&gt;Finke Desert Race&lt;/a&gt;. The Finke Desert Race is a 'there and back' challenge from Alice Springs to Aputula (Finke) Community, covering a 460-kilometre round trip.\nArts and entertainment.\nGalleries and museums.\nAlice Springs is known as the Aboriginal Art capital of Central Australia, home to many local and Aboriginal art galleries. &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australian%20art\"&gt;Indigenous Australian art&lt;/a&gt; is the more dominant, and galleries showcase the rich culture and native traditions that abound in Central Australia. Trade in Aboriginal art soared after the painting movement began at &lt;a href=\"Papunya\"&gt;Papunya&lt;/a&gt;, a Central Australian Aboriginal settlement, and swept other indigenous communities. Central Australia is the home of some of the most prominent names in Aboriginal art, including &lt;a href=\"Emily%20Kngwarreye\"&gt;Emily Kngwarreye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnie%20Pwerle\"&gt;Minnie Pwerle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20Possum%20Tjapaltjarri\"&gt;Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Namatjira\"&gt;Albert Namatjira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wenten%20Rubuntja\"&gt;Wenten Rubuntja&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Museum of Central Australia / Stehlow Research Centre features some of the most important natural history and archival materials tied to the history and culture of the region.
