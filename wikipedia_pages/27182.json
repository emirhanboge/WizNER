    "text": "A skinhead is a member of a subculture which originated among &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt; youths in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1960s and soon spread to other parts of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, with a second working class skinhead movement emerging worldwide in the late 1970s. Motivated by &lt;a href=\"social%20alienation\"&gt;social alienation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solidarity\"&gt;working class solidarity&lt;/a&gt;, skinheads (often shortened to \"skins\" in the UK) are defined by their close-cropped or &lt;a href=\"Head%20shaving\"&gt;shaven heads&lt;/a&gt; and working-class clothing such as &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Martens\"&gt;Dr. Martens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"steel%20toe\"&gt;steel toe&lt;/a&gt; work boots, &lt;a href=\"Suspenders\"&gt;braces&lt;/a&gt;, high rise and varying length straight-leg &lt;a href=\"jeans\"&gt;jeans&lt;/a&gt;, and button-down collar shirts, usually slim fitting in check or plain. The movement reached a peak at the end of the 1960s, experienced a revival in the 1980s, and, since then, has endured in multiple contexts worldwide.\nThe rise to prominence of skinheads came in two waves, with the first wave taking place in the late 1960s. The first skinheads were working class youths motivated by an expression of &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20culture\"&gt;alternative values&lt;/a&gt; and working class pride, rejecting both the austerity and &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservatism&lt;/a&gt; of the 1950s-early 1960s and the more &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bourgeois\"&gt;bourgeois&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hippie%20movement\"&gt;hippie movement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hippie\"&gt;peace and love&lt;/a&gt; ethos of the mid to late 1960s. Skinheads were instead drawn towards more working class outsider &lt;a href=\"subculture\"&gt;subculture&lt;/a&gt;s, incorporating elements of early working class &lt;a href=\"Mod%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt; fashion and &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n music and fashion, especially from Jamaican &lt;a href=\"rude%20boy\"&gt;rude boy&lt;/a&gt;s. In the earlier stages of the movement, a considerable overlap existed between early skinhead subculture, &lt;a href=\"mod%20subculture\"&gt;mod subculture&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"rude%20boy\"&gt;rude boy subculture&lt;/a&gt; found among &lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20British\"&gt;Jamaican British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20diaspora\"&gt;Jamaican immigrant&lt;/a&gt; youth, as these three groups interacted and fraternized with each other within the same working class and poor neighbourhoods in Britain. As skinheads adopted elements of mod subculture and Jamaican British and Jamaican immigrant rude boy subculture, both first and second generation skins were influenced by the rhythms of &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rocksteady\"&gt;rocksteady&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"reggae\"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt;, as well as sometimes &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;rhythm and blues&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s saw a revival of the skinhead subculture, and increasing interaction between its adherents and the new &lt;a href=\"punk%20subculture\"&gt;punk movement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oi%21\"&gt;Oi!&lt;/a&gt;, a street-level working class offshoot of &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt;, became a vital component of skinhead culture, while the Jamaican genres beloved by first generation skinheads were filtered through punk and &lt;a href=\"new%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; in a style known as &lt;a href=\"Two-tone%20%28music%20genre%29\"&gt;2 Tone&lt;/a&gt;. With these twin musical movements, the skinhead subculture diversified and contemporary skinhead fashions ranged from clean-cut 1960s mod- and rude boy-influenced styles to less-strict &lt;a href=\"punk%20fashion\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt;-influenced styles.\nDuring the early 1980s, political affiliations grew in significance and split the subculture, distancing the &lt;a href=\"far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"far-left%20politics\"&gt;far-left&lt;/a&gt; strands, although many skins described themselves as &lt;a href=\"Apoliticism\"&gt;apolitical&lt;/a&gt;. In Great Britain, the skinhead subculture became associated in the public eye with membership of groups such as the far-right &lt;a href=\"British%20National%20Front\"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20Movement\"&gt;British Movement&lt;/a&gt;. By the 1990s, &lt;a href=\"neo-Nazi%20skinhead\"&gt;neo-Nazi skinhead&lt;/a&gt; movements existed across all of Europe and North America, but were counterbalanced by the presence of groups such as &lt;a href=\"Skinheads%20Against%20Racial%20Prejudice\"&gt;Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice&lt;/a&gt; which sprung up in response. To this day, the skinhead subculture reflects a broad spectrum of political beliefs, even as many continue to embrace it as a largely apolitical working class movement.\nHistory.\nOrigins and first wave.\nIn the late 1950s the post-war &lt;a href=\"boom%20and%20bust\"&gt;economic boom&lt;/a&gt; led to an increase in &lt;a href=\"disposable%20income\"&gt;disposable income&lt;/a&gt; among many young people. Some of those youths spent that income on new fashions; they wore ripped clothes and would use pieces of material to patch them up popularised by American &lt;a href=\"soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; groups, British &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; bands, certain film actors, and &lt;a href=\"Carnaby%20Street\"&gt;Carnaby Street&lt;/a&gt; clothing merchants. These youths became known as &lt;a href=\"Mod%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, a youth subculture noted for its &lt;a href=\"consumerism\"&gt;consumerism&lt;/a&gt; and devotion to fashion, music, and &lt;a href=\"scooter%20%28motorcycle%29\"&gt;scooters&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorking class mods chose practical clothing styles that suited their lifestyle and employment circumstances: work &lt;a href=\"boot\"&gt;boot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"combat%20boot\"&gt;army boots&lt;/a&gt;, straight-leg &lt;a href=\"jeans\"&gt;jeans&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sta-Prest\"&gt;Sta-Prest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trousers\"&gt;trousers&lt;/a&gt;, button-down shirts and braces. When possible, these working class mods spent their money on suits and other sharp outfits to wear at dancehalls, where they enjoyed &lt;a href=\"Soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rocksteady\"&gt;rocksteady&lt;/a&gt; music.\nAround 1966, a &lt;a href=\"Schism%20%28religion%29\"&gt;schism&lt;/a&gt; developed between the \"peacock mods\" (also known as \"smooth mods\"), who were less violent and always wore the latest expensive clothes, and the \"hard mods\" (also known as \"&lt;a href=\"gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; mods\", \"lemonheads\" or \"peanuts\"), who were identified by their shorter hair and more working class image. \"Hard mods\" became commonly known as skinheads by about 1968. Their short hair may have come about for practical reasons, since long hair could be a liability in industrial jobs and streetfights. Skinheads may also have cut their hair short in defiance of the more middle class &lt;a href=\"hippie\"&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt; culture.\nIn addition to retaining many mod influences, early skinheads were very interested in &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"rude%20boy\"&gt;rude boy&lt;/a&gt; styles and culture, especially the music: ska, rocksteady, and early &lt;a href=\"reggae\"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt; (before the &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; slowed down and lyrics became focused on topics like &lt;a href=\"black%20nationalism\"&gt;black nationalism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rastafari%20movement\"&gt;Rastafari movement&lt;/a&gt;).\nSkinhead culture became so popular by 1969 that even the rock band &lt;a href=\"Slade\"&gt;Slade&lt;/a&gt; temporarily adopted the look as a marketing strategy. The subculture gained wider notice because of a series of violent and sexually explicit novels by &lt;a href=\"James%20Moffat%20%28author%29\"&gt;Richard Allen&lt;/a&gt;, notably \"Skinhead\" and \"Skinhead Escapes\". Due to largescale British migration to &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, many British youths in that city joined skinhead/&lt;a href=\"sharpies%20%28Australian%20subculture%29\"&gt;sharpies&lt;/a&gt; gangs in the late 1960s and developed their own Australian style.\nBy the early 1970s, the skinhead subculture started to fade from popular culture, and some of the original skins dropped into new categories, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Suedehead%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;suedeheads&lt;/a&gt;\" (defined by the ability to manipulate one's hair with a comb), \"smoothies\" (often with shoulder-length hairstyles), and \"bootboys\" (with mod-length hair; associated with gangs and &lt;a href=\"football%20hooliganism\"&gt;football hooliganism&lt;/a&gt;). Some fashion trends returned to the mod roots, with &lt;a href=\"brogues\"&gt;brogues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loafers\"&gt;loafers&lt;/a&gt;, suits, and the &lt;a href=\"Trousers\"&gt;slacks&lt;/a&gt;-and-&lt;a href=\"sweater\"&gt;sweater&lt;/a&gt; look making a comeback.\nSecond wave.\nIn the late 1970s, the skinhead subculture was revived to a notable extent after the introduction of &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these revivalist skinheads reacted to the commercialism of punk by adopting a look that was in line with the original 1969 skinhead style. This revival included Gary Hodges and &lt;a href=\"Hoxton%20Tom%20McCourt\"&gt;Hoxton Tom McCourt&lt;/a&gt; (both later of the band the &lt;a href=\"4-Skins\"&gt;4-Skins&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Suggs%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Suggs&lt;/a&gt;, later of the band &lt;a href=\"Madness%20%28band%29\"&gt;Madness&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, some skinheads became affiliated with &lt;a href=\"far-right%20politics\"&gt;far right&lt;/a&gt; groups such as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Front%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Movement\"&gt;British Movement&lt;/a&gt;. From 1979 onwards, &lt;a href=\"Punk%20fashion\"&gt;punk-influenced&lt;/a&gt; skinheads with shorter hair, higher boots and less emphasis on traditional styles grew in numbers and grabbed media attention, mostly due to &lt;a href=\"football%20hooliganism\"&gt;football hooliganism&lt;/a&gt;. There still remained, however, skinheads who preferred the original mod-inspired styles. \nEventually different interpretations of the skinhead subculture expanded beyond Britain and continental Europe. In the United States, certain segments of the &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20punk\"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; scene embraced skinhead styles and developed their own version of the subculture.\nBill Osgerby has argued that skinhead culture more broadly grows strength from specific economic circumstances. In a BBC interview , he remarked \"In the late 70s and early 80s, working class culture was disintegrating through unemployment and inner city decay and there was an attempt to recapture a sense of working class solidarity and identity in the face of a tide of social change.\"\nGermany.\nBy the 1980s street fights regularly broke out in &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; between skinheads and members of the &lt;a href=\"anti-fascist\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"left%20wing\"&gt;left wing&lt;/a&gt; youth movements. German &lt;a href=\"neo-nazism\"&gt;neo-nazis&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20K%C3%BChnen\"&gt;Michael K\u00fchnen&lt;/a&gt;, sought to expand their ranks with new young members from the burgeoning skinhead scene. On the other side of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the skinhead youth movement had developed two different styles: one was more focused on rebellious youth fashion styles while the other camp often dressed in regular clothes and focused more heavily on political activity. These groups were infiltrated by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Stasi\"&gt;Stasi&lt;/a&gt; and did not last long in East Germany. After a group of skinheads attacked a punk concert at Zion's Church (East Berlin) in 1987, many skinhead leaders fled to West Germany to avoid arrest.\nStyle.\nHair.\nMost first wave skinheads used a &lt;a href=\"Buzz%20cut\"&gt;No. 2 or No. 3 grade clip guard&lt;/a&gt; cut (short, but not bald). From the late 1970s, male skinheads typically shaved their heads with a No. 2 grade clip or shorter. During that period, side partings were sometimes shaved into the hair. Since the 1980s, some skinheads have clipped their hair with no guard, or even shaved it with a razor. Some skinheads sport &lt;a href=\"sideburns\"&gt;sideburns&lt;/a&gt; of various styles, usually neatly trimmed.\nBy the 1970s, most female skins had mod-style haircuts. During the 1980s skinhead revival, many female skinheads had feathercuts (\"Chelsea\" in North America). A feathercut is short on the crown, with &lt;a href=\"Fringe%20%28hair%29\"&gt;fringes&lt;/a&gt; at the front, back and sides.\nClothing.\nSkinheads wore long-sleeve or short-sleeve &lt;a href=\"Dress%20shirt\"&gt;button-down shirts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20shirt\"&gt;polo shirts&lt;/a&gt; by brands such as &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Sherman\"&gt;Ben Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Perry\"&gt;Fred Perry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brutus%20Jeans\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, Warrior or Jaytex; &lt;a href=\"Lonsdale%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Lonsdale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Everlast%20%28boxing%29\"&gt;Everlast&lt;/a&gt; shirts or &lt;a href=\"sweatshirts\"&gt;sweatshirts&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Grandfather%20shirt\"&gt;Grandfather shirt&lt;/a&gt;s; V-neck &lt;a href=\"sweater\"&gt;sweater&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"sleeveless%20sweater\"&gt;sleeveless sweater&lt;/a&gt;s (known in the UK as a \"tank top\"); &lt;a href=\"Cardigan%20%28sweater%29\"&gt;cardigan sweaters&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"T-shirt\"&gt;T-shirt&lt;/a&gt;s (plain or with text or designs related to the skinhead subculture). They might wear fitted &lt;a href=\"blazer\"&gt;blazer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Harrington%20jacket\"&gt;Harrington jacket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Flight%20jacket\"&gt;bomber jackets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"denim\"&gt;denim&lt;/a&gt; jackets (usually blue, sometimes splattered with bleach), &lt;a href=\"donkey%20jacket\"&gt;donkey jacket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crombie%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Crombie&lt;/a&gt;-style overcoats, &lt;a href=\"sheepskin\"&gt;sheepskin&lt;/a&gt; \u00be-length coats, short &lt;a href=\"Mackintosh\"&gt;macs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monkey%20jackets\"&gt;monkey jackets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anorak\"&gt;parkas&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional (\"hard mod\") skinheads sometimes wore suits, often of two-tone tonic fabric (shiny &lt;a href=\"mohair\"&gt;mohair&lt;/a&gt;-like material that changes colour in different light and angles), or in a &lt;a href=\"Glen%20plaid\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"houndstooth\"&gt;houndstooth&lt;/a&gt; check pattern.\nMany skinheads wore &lt;a href=\"Sta-Prest\"&gt;Sta-Prest&lt;/a&gt; flat-fronted slacks or other dress &lt;a href=\"trousers\"&gt;trousers&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"jeans\"&gt;jeans&lt;/a&gt; (normally &lt;a href=\"Levi%20Strauss%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Levi's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lee%20%28Jeans%29\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wrangler%20Jeans\"&gt;Wrangler&lt;/a&gt;); or combat trousers (plain or camouflage). Jeans and slacks were worn deliberately short (either hemmed, rolled or tucked) to show off boots, or to show off socks when wearing loafers or brogues. Jeans were often blue, with a parallel leg design, hemmed or with clean and thin rolled cuffs (turn-ups), and were sometimes splattered with &lt;a href=\"bleach\"&gt;bleach&lt;/a&gt; to resemble &lt;a href=\"camouflage\"&gt;camouflage&lt;/a&gt; trousers (a style popular among &lt;a href=\"Oi%21\"&gt;Oi!&lt;/a&gt; skinheads).\nMany traditionalist skinheads wore braces (suspenders), in various colours, usually no more than 1\" in width, clipped to the trouser waistband. In some areas, braces much wider than that may identify a skinhead as either unfashionable or as a &lt;a href=\"white%20power%20skinhead\"&gt;white power skinhead&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, braces were worn up in an X shape at the back, but some Oi!-oriented skinheads wore their braces hanging down. Patterned braces \u2013 often black and white check, or vertical stripes \u2013 were sometimes worn by traditional skinheads. In a few cases, the colour of braces or flight jackets were used to signify affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. The practice of using the colour clothing items to indicate affiliations became less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who were more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion.\nHats common among skinheads include: &lt;a href=\"Trilby\"&gt;Trilby&lt;/a&gt; hats; &lt;a href=\"pork%20pie%20hat\"&gt;pork pie hat&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"flat%20cap\"&gt;flat cap&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Scally caps\" or \"driver caps\"), &lt;a href=\"Tuque\"&gt;winter woollen hats&lt;/a&gt; (without a bobble). Less common have been &lt;a href=\"bowler%20hat\"&gt;bowler hat&lt;/a&gt;s (mostly among suedeheads and those influenced by the film \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29\"&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/a&gt;\").\nTraditionalist skinheads sometimes wore a silk handkerchief in the breast pocket of a Crombie-style overcoat or tonic suit jacket, in some cases fastened with an ornate stud. Some wore pocket flashes instead. These are pieces of silk in contrasting colours, mounted on a piece of cardboard and designed to look like an elaborately folded handkerchief. It was common to choose the colours based on one's favourite football club. Some skinheads wore button badges or sewn-on fabric patches with designs related to affiliations, interests or beliefs. Also popular were woollen or printed rayon scarves in football club colours, worn knotted at the neck, wrist, or hanging from a belt loop at the waist. Silk or faux-silk scarves (especially Tootal brand) with &lt;a href=\"paisley%20%28design%29\"&gt;paisley&lt;/a&gt; patterns were also sometimes worn. Some suedeheads carried closed umbrellas with sharpened tips, or a handle with a pull-out blade. This led to the nickname \"brollie boys\".\nFemale skinheads generally wore the same clothing items as men, with addition of skirts, stockings, or dress suits composed of a three-quarter-length jacket and matching short skirt. Some skingirls wore fishnet stockings and mini-skirts, a style introduced during the punk-influenced skinhead revival.\nFootwear.\nMost skinheads wear &lt;a href=\"boot\"&gt;boot&lt;/a&gt;s; in the 1960s &lt;a href=\"Combat%20boot\"&gt;army surplus&lt;/a&gt; or generic workboots, later &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Martens\"&gt;Dr. Martens&lt;/a&gt; boots and shoes. In 1960s Britain, steel-toe boots worn by skinheads and hooligans were called &lt;a href=\"bovver%20boot\"&gt;bovver boot&lt;/a&gt;s; whence skinheads have themselves sometimes been called \"bovver boys\". Skinheads have also been known to wear &lt;a href=\"brogues\"&gt;brogues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loafers\"&gt;loafers&lt;/a&gt; or Dr. Martens (or similarly styled) low shoes.\nIn recent years, other brands of boots, such as &lt;a href=\"Solovair\"&gt;Solovair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tredair\"&gt;Tredair&lt;/a&gt; Grinders, and gripfast have become popular among skinheads, partly because most Dr. Martens are no longer made in England. &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt;-style &lt;a href=\"athletic%20shoe\"&gt;athletic shoe&lt;/a&gt;s, by brands such as &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gola%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Gola&lt;/a&gt;, have become popular with many skinheads. Female or child skinheads generally wear the same footwear as men, with the addition of monkey boots. The traditional brand for monkey boots was Grafters, but nowadays they are also made by Dr. Martens and Solovair.\nIn the early days of the skinhead subculture, some skinheads chose boot lace colours based on the football team they supported. Later, some skinheads (particularly highly political ones) began to use lace colour to indicate beliefs or affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and have had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. This practice has become less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who are more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion purposes.\n&lt;a href=\"Suedehead%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;Suedeheads&lt;/a&gt; sometimes wore coloured socks (for example, red or blue rather than black or white).\nMusic.\nThe skinhead subculture was originally associated with &lt;a href=\"black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; music genres such as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rocksteady\"&gt;rocksteady&lt;/a&gt;, and early &lt;a href=\"reggae\"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt;. The link between skinheads and &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaican music&lt;/a&gt; led to the UK popularity of groups such as &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Dekker\"&gt;Desmond Dekker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Morgan\"&gt;Derrick Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Aitken\"&gt;Laurel Aitken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symarip\"&gt;Symarip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pioneers%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Pioneers&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1970s, some reggae songs began to feature themes of &lt;a href=\"black%20nationalism\"&gt;black nationalism&lt;/a&gt;, which many white skinheads could not relate to. This shift in reggae's lyrical themes created some tension between black and white skinheads, who otherwise got along fairly well. Around this time, some &lt;a href=\"Suedehead%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;suedeheads&lt;/a&gt; (an offshoot of the skinhead subculture) started listening to British &lt;a href=\"glam%20rock\"&gt;glam rock&lt;/a&gt; bands such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slade\"&gt;Slade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mott%20the%20Hoople\"&gt;Mott the Hoople&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most popular music style for late-1970s skinheads was &lt;a href=\"2%20Tone%20%28music%20genre%29\"&gt;2 Tone&lt;/a&gt;, a fusion of ska, rocksteady, reggae, pop and &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt;. The 2 Tone genre was named after &lt;a href=\"2%20Tone%20Records\"&gt;2 Tone Records&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"record%20label\"&gt;record label&lt;/a&gt; that featured bands such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Specials\"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madness%20%28band%29\"&gt;Madness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Selecter\"&gt;The Selecter&lt;/a&gt;. Some late-1970s skinheads also liked certain punk rock bands, such as &lt;a href=\"Sham%2069\"&gt;Sham 69&lt;/a&gt; and Menace.\nIn the late 1970s, after the first wave of punk rock, many skinheads embraced &lt;a href=\"Oi%21\"&gt;Oi!&lt;/a&gt;, a working class punk subgenre. Musically, Oi! combines standard punk with elements of &lt;a href=\"football%20chant\"&gt;football chant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pub%20rock%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;pub rock&lt;/a&gt; and British glam rock. The Oi! scene was partly a response to a sense that many participants in the early punk scene were, in the words of &lt;a href=\"The%20Business%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Business&lt;/a&gt; guitarist Steve Kent, \"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic ... and losing touch\". The term Oi! as a musical genre is said to come from the band &lt;a href=\"Cockney%20Rejects\"&gt;Cockney Rejects&lt;/a&gt; and journalist &lt;a href=\"Garry%20Bushell\"&gt;Garry Bushell&lt;/a&gt;, who championed the genre in &lt;a href=\"Sounds%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Sounds\" magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Not exclusively a skinhead genre, many Oi! bands included skins, &lt;a href=\"punk%20subculture\"&gt;punks&lt;/a&gt; and people who fit into neither category. Notable Oi! bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s include &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Upstarts\"&gt;Angelic Upstarts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20%28British%20band%29\"&gt;Blitz&lt;/a&gt;, the Business, Last Resort, &lt;a href=\"The%20Burial\"&gt;The Burial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Combat%2084\"&gt;Combat 84&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%204-Skins\"&gt;the 4-Skins&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmerican Oi! began in the 1980s, with bands such as &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Chaos\"&gt;U.S. Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Press%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Press&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Cross%20%28band%29\"&gt;Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bruisers\"&gt;The Bruisers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anti-Heros\"&gt;Anti-Heros&lt;/a&gt;. American skinheads created a link between their subculture and &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20punk\"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; music, with bands such as &lt;a href=\"Warzone%20%28band%29\"&gt;Warzone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agnostic%20Front\"&gt;Agnostic Front&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cro-Mags\"&gt;Cro-Mags&lt;/a&gt;. The Oi! style has also spread to other parts of the world, and remains popular with many skinheads. Many later Oi! bands have combined influences from early American hardcore and 1970s British &lt;a href=\"street%20punk\"&gt;streetpunk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong some skinheads, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; is popular. Bands such as the Canadian act &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy%20%28band%29\"&gt;Blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, whose guitarist is black, has been known to popularise and merchandise the phrase \"black metal skinheads\". As the group's vocalist recounts, \"a lot of black metal skinheads from the other side of Canada\" would join in on the &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;n black metal underground. \"I remember one guy... who had 'Black Metal Skins' tattooed on his forehead. We didn't hang out with white power skinheads, but there were some Oi skinheads who wanted to hang out with us.\" &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialist%20black%20metal\"&gt;National Socialist black metal&lt;/a&gt; has an audience among white power skinheads. There was a record label called \"Satanic Skinhead Propaganda\" that was known to specialize in neo-Nazi black metal and death metal bands. Black metal pioneer and right-wing extremist &lt;a href=\"Varg%20Vikernes\"&gt;Varg Vikernes&lt;/a&gt; was known to adopt a skinhead look and wear a belt with the SS insignia while serving time in prison for the &lt;a href=\"Varg%20Vikernes%23Arson%20of%20churches\"&gt;arson of several stave churches&lt;/a&gt; and the murder of &lt;a href=\"%C3%98ystein%20Aarseth\"&gt;\u00d8ystein Aarseth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough many &lt;a href=\"white%20power%20skinhead\"&gt;white power skinhead&lt;/a&gt;s listened to Oi! music, they developed a separate genre more in line with their politics: &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Against%20Communism\"&gt;Rock Against Communism&lt;/a&gt; (RAC). The most notable RAC band was &lt;a href=\"Skrewdriver\"&gt;Skrewdriver&lt;/a&gt;, which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a &lt;a href=\"Neo-Nazism\"&gt;neo-Nazi&lt;/a&gt; band after the first lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed. RAC started out musically similar to Oi! and punk, but has since adopted elements from other genres. White power music that draws inspiration from &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20punk\"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes called &lt;a href=\"hatecore\"&gt;hatecore&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacism, anti-racism, and politics.\nThe early skinheads were not necessarily part of any political movement, but as the 1970s progressed, many skinheads became more politically active and acts of &lt;a href=\"Racism\"&gt;racially-motivated&lt;/a&gt; skinhead violence began to occur in the United Kingdom. As a result of this change within the skinheads, far right groups such as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Front%20%28UK%29\"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Movement\"&gt;British Movement&lt;/a&gt; saw a rise in the number of &lt;a href=\"white%20power%20skinhead\"&gt;white power skinhead&lt;/a&gt;s among their ranks. By the late 1970s, the mass media, and subsequently the general public, had largely come to view the skinhead subculture as one that promotes racism and &lt;a href=\"neo-Nazism\"&gt;neo-Nazism&lt;/a&gt;. The white power and neo-Nazi skinhead subculture eventually spread to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and other areas of the world. The mainstream media started using the term \"skinhead\" in reports of racist violence (regardless of whether the perpetrator was actually a skinhead); this has played a large role in skewing public perceptions about the subculture. Three notable groups that formed in the 1980s and which later became associated with white power skinheads are &lt;a href=\"White%20Aryan%20Resistance\"&gt;White Aryan Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20and%20Honour\"&gt;Blood and Honour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerskins\"&gt;Hammerskins&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, many skinheads and &lt;a href=\"Suedehead%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;suedeheads&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom rejected both the far left and the far right. This attitude was musically typified by &lt;a href=\"Oi%21\"&gt;Oi!&lt;/a&gt; bands such as &lt;a href=\"Cockney%20Rejects\"&gt;Cockney Rejects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%204-Skins\"&gt;The 4-Skins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toy%20Dolls\"&gt;Toy Dolls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Business%20%28band%29\"&gt;The Business&lt;/a&gt;. Two notable groups of skinheads that spoke out against neo-Nazism and political extremism\u2014and instead spoke out in support of &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20skinhead\"&gt;traditional skinhead&lt;/a&gt; culture\u2014were the Glasgow Spy Kids in Scotland (who coined the phrase \"Spirit of '69\"), and the publishers of the \"Hard As Nails\" &lt;a href=\"zine\"&gt;zine&lt;/a&gt; in England.\nIn the late 1960s, some skinheads in the United Kingdom (including &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; skinheads) engaged in violence against &lt;a href=\"British%20Asian\"&gt;South Asian immigrants&lt;/a&gt; (an act known as \"&lt;a href=\"Paki%20%28slur%29\"&gt;Paki bashing&lt;/a&gt;\" in common slang). There had, however, also been &lt;a href=\"Anti-racism\"&gt;anti-racist&lt;/a&gt; skinheads since the beginning of the subculture, especially in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20England\"&gt;Northern England&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the far left of the skinhead subculture, &lt;a href=\"Redskin%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;redskins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anarchism\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; skinheads take a militant &lt;a href=\"anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; and pro-working class stance. The phrase \"&lt;a href=\"all%20cops%20are%20bastards\"&gt;all cops are bastards&lt;/a&gt;\" was popularized among some skinheads by &lt;a href=\"The%204-Skins\"&gt;The 4-Skins&lt;/a&gt;'s 1982 song \"A.C.A.B.\" In the United Kingdom, two groups with significant numbers of leftist skinhead members were &lt;a href=\"Red%20Action\"&gt;Red Action&lt;/a&gt;, which started in 1981, and &lt;a href=\"Anti-Fascist%20Action\"&gt;Anti-Fascist Action&lt;/a&gt;, which started in 1985. Internationally, the most notable left-wing skinhead organisation is &lt;a href=\"Skinheads%20Against%20Racial%20Prejudice\"&gt;Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice&lt;/a&gt;, which formed in the New York City area in 1987 and then spread to other countries."
