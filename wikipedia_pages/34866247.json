    "text": "The Composition of Yards and Perches () or the Statute of Ells and Perches was a &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20England\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weights%20and%20Measures%20Acts%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; defining the length of the &lt;a href=\"barleycorn%20%28unit%29\"&gt;barleycorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"inch\"&gt;inch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"foot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;foot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yard\"&gt;yard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Perch%20%28unit%29\"&gt;perch&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the area of the &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;. Its date has been estimated at 1266\u20131303.\nThe Latin text from the manuscript known as \"BL Cotton MS Claudius D 2\" is translated in &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Ruffhead\"&gt;Ruffhead&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Statutes%20at%20Large%23England%20and%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Statutes at Large&lt;/a&gt;\") as \nA similar statement is made in &lt;a href=\"Liber%20Horn\"&gt;Liber Horn&lt;/a&gt; (as published in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Statutes%20of%20the%20Realm\"&gt;The Statutes of the Realm&lt;/a&gt;\"): \nThe \"Composition of Yards and Perches\" belongs to a class of documents known as &lt;a href=\"Statutes%20of%20uncertain%20date\"&gt;Statutes of uncertain date&lt;/a&gt; generally thought to be from c. 1250 to 1305. Although not originally statutes, they gradually acquired the force of law. In some early statute books \"Composition of Yards and Perches\" was appended to another statute of uncertain date, the \"Statute for the Measuring of Land\" also known as \"Statutum de Admensuratione Terrase\", \"An Ordinance for Measuring of Land\", sometimes (erroneously) listed as \"33\u00b0 Edward I. st. 6. (1305)\". The \"Composition of Yards and Perches\" was repealed by the &lt;a href=\"Weights%20and%20Measures%20Act%201824\"&gt;Weights and Measures Act 1824&lt;/a&gt; (5 George IV c. 74, par. 23)."
