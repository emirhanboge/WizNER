WNNH is &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20license\"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Henniker%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Henniker, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; and serves the &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Manchester%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; area. Its &lt;a href=\"transmitter\"&gt;transmitter&lt;/a&gt; is on Watchtower Road in &lt;a href=\"Hopkinton%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Hopkinton&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"radio%20studio\"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;s and offices are on Church Street in &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;.\nWNNH airs an &lt;a href=\"active%20rock\"&gt;active rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"radio%20format\"&gt;radio format&lt;/a&gt;, it is part of Binnie Media's Bone franchise. It is the sister station of WHXR-FM (106.3 The Bone) located in Portland, ME.\nHistory.\nWNNH first &lt;a href=\"Sign-on\"&gt;signed on the air&lt;/a&gt; in October 1989 from the &lt;a href=\"Pats%20Peak\"&gt;Pats Peak&lt;/a&gt; Ski Area in Henniker, with studios on South Street in &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;. The station's original owner was Clark Smidt, who programmed several Boston FM stations in the 1970s, including WEEI-FM (103.3, now &lt;a href=\"WBGB%20%28FM%29\"&gt;WBGB&lt;/a&gt;) and WBZ-FM (106.7, now &lt;a href=\"WMJX\"&gt;WMJX&lt;/a&gt;). WNNH's original format was &lt;a href=\"oldies\"&gt;oldies&lt;/a&gt;. In the early days, the station also marketed itself to the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; area, even though it was a &lt;a href=\"Rimshot%20%28broadcasting%29\"&gt;rimshot signal&lt;/a&gt; into Manchester itself, and practically inaudible south of the city. At the outset, WNNH had a very slick sound for a small market station, complete with &lt;a href=\"PAMS\"&gt;PAMS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jingle\"&gt;jingle&lt;/a&gt;s. The station had a diverse playlist \u2014 deeper than most oldies stations.\nIn 1994, Smidt tried to purchase &lt;a href=\"WJYY\"&gt;WJYY&lt;/a&gt; (105.5 FM) and its then-satellite station, WRCI (107.7 FM; now &lt;a href=\"WTPL\"&gt;WTPL&lt;/a&gt;), from Empire Broadcasting Partners, with the idea of putting WNNH on 105.5 to reinforce its signal in Concord. Empire Broadcasting owned a group of radio stations in &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20New%20York\"&gt;Upstate New York&lt;/a&gt; and Northern &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"WGY%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WGY&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schenectady%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Schenectady, New York&lt;/a&gt;), but had overextended themselves and went bankrupt. The bankruptcy court ruled that Empire Radio Partners could not be reorganized and ordered the stations sold at auction; another company, RadioWorks, was chosen by the court as the winner of the auction.\nSmidt sold WNNH to Tele-Media in 1999; Tele-Media, in turn, sold WNNH, &lt;a href=\"WLKZ\"&gt;WLKZ&lt;/a&gt; (104.9 FM), and WHOB (106.3 FM; now &lt;a href=\"WFNQ\"&gt;WFNQ&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=\"Nassau%20Broadcasting%20Partners\"&gt;Nassau Broadcasting Partners&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. However, even though WLKZ, which Tele-Media had acquired in 2000, also broadcast an oldies format (albeit serving the nearby &lt;a href=\"Lakes%20Region%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;Lakes Region&lt;/a&gt;), the two stations continued to be programmed and branded separately until 2007, when Nassau consolidated the two stations into a simulcast. That December, the stations shifted to a &lt;a href=\"classic%20hits\"&gt;classic hits&lt;/a&gt; format, using Nassau's &lt;a href=\"Frank%20FM\"&gt;Frank FM&lt;/a&gt; brand, as a result of an unsuccessful attempt to convert WWHK (102.3 FM, now &lt;a href=\"WAKC\"&gt;WAKC&lt;/a&gt;) and WWHQ (101.5 FM, now &lt;a href=\"WWLK-FM\"&gt;WWLK-FM&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href=\"classic%20rock\"&gt;classic rock&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"sports%20radio\"&gt;sports radio&lt;/a&gt; programming from &lt;a href=\"WEEI%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WEEI&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 27, 2009, it was announced that WNNH and WWHQ would be spun off into a divestiture trust and sold as part of a debt-for-equity restructuring of Nassau Broadcasting in which &lt;a href=\"Goldman%20Sachs\"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt; became 85% owner of the company. The new ownership structure ended Nassau's grandfathered status with respect to how many stations in the Concord-Lakes Region market it could own. A sale of the two stations to Great Eastern Radio was announced on September 22, 2009. In the interim, Nassau discontinued \"99 and 104.9 Frank FM\" on November 4, and switched WNNH to a simulcast of WJYY for several weeks before converting it to a loop of promotions for other Nassau stations in the Concord-Lakes Region market. The station went silent on March 1, 2010, due to power failure and returned to the air in March 2011 as a simulcast of the Maine-based &lt;a href=\"WBACH\"&gt;WBACH&lt;/a&gt; network of &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; stations.\nWNNH, along with 16 other Nassau stations in northern New England, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by WBIN Media Company, a company controlled by &lt;a href=\"William%20Harrison%20Binnie\"&gt;Bill Binnie&lt;/a&gt;, on May 22, 2012. Binnie already owned &lt;a href=\"WWJE-DT\"&gt;WBIN-TV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Derry%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Derry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WBTS-CD\"&gt;WYCN-LP&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nashua%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Nashua&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was completed on November 30, 2012; a few weeks earlier, on November 9, WNNH dropped the simulcast of WBACH and returned to the classic hits format and Frank FM branding dropped three years earlier.\nOn August 31, 2015, WNNH switched to \"99.1 NH1 News\" with local news (including simulcasts of the \"NH1\"-branded newscasts on WBIN-TV) and &lt;a href=\"Radio%20syndication\"&gt;syndicated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talk%20radio\"&gt;talk shows&lt;/a&gt;, including a weekday morning show with Jack Heath provided by &lt;a href=\"WGIR%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WGIR&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manchester%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Manchester, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Howie%20Carr\"&gt;Howie Carr&lt;/a&gt; in afternoons, and nationally syndicated shows from &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Gallagher%20%28political%20commentator%29\"&gt;Mike Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Prager\"&gt;Dennis Prager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Savage\"&gt;Michael Savage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Larson\"&gt;Lars Larson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Radio\"&gt;Red Eye Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Light%20%28radio%29\"&gt;First Light&lt;/a&gt;. National news came from &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Radio%20News\"&gt;CBS Radio News&lt;/a&gt;. WNNH carried &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;.\nWNNH returned to an oldies format on August 7, 2017, as an affiliate of &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Shannon\"&gt;Scott Shannon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20True%20Oldies%20Channel\"&gt;True Oldies Channel&lt;/a&gt;. The format change came after Binnie took control of competing talk radio station WTPL under a &lt;a href=\"local%20marketing%20agreement\"&gt;local marketing agreement&lt;/a&gt;; it also followed the sale of \"NH1\" flagship station WBIN-TV.\nOn April 1, 2019, WNNH again reinstated the Frank FM branding and the classic hits format, via a simulcast with sister station WFNQ out of &lt;a href=\"Nashua%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Nashua, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;. By late 2020, WNNH had become a simulcast of &lt;a href=\"WLNH-FM\"&gt;WLNH-FM&lt;/a&gt; (98.3).\nOn September 3, 2021, at 6am, WNNH split from its simulcast with WLNH and launched an active rock format, branded as \"99.1 The Bone\"."
