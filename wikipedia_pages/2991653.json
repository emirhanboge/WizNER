The style also prompted her to record \"What is Slackness?\"; a song in which she defines 'slackness' in many ways. Slackness often refers to vulgarity in Jamaican culture, behavior and the music. It always sums up the explicit sexual lyrics used in reggae and dancehall music. Because of this, several of her performances were banned in some parts of Jamaica, though equally lewd male performances were not. The &lt;a href=\"double%20standard\"&gt;double standard&lt;/a&gt; inspired her to record the song \"Freedom of Speech\" in protest. She also became known for her \"conscious\" lyrics. She recorded \"Condom\"; warning girls of the dangers of unprotected heterosexual sex."
