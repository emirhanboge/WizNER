    "text": "The University of Bolton Stadium is the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Horwich\"&gt;Horwich&lt;/a&gt;, Lancashire , England.\nOpening in 1997, it was named the Reebok Stadium, after club sponsors &lt;a href=\"Reebok\"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, Bolton Wanderers signed a naming rights deal with Italian sportswear company &lt;a href=\"Macron%20%28sportswear%29\"&gt;Macron&lt;/a&gt;. It was renamed the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bolton\"&gt;University of Bolton&lt;/a&gt; Stadium in 2018.\nA hotel forms part of the stadium and some of the rooms offer views of the pitch.\nHistory.\nUniversity of Bolton Stadium is an &lt;a href=\"all-seater%20stadium\"&gt;all-seater stadium&lt;/a&gt; with a capacity of almost 29,000 and was completed in 1997, replacing the club's old ground, &lt;a href=\"Burnden%20Park\"&gt;Burnden Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurnden Park, which at its peak had held up to 60,000 spectators, was becoming increasingly dilapidated by the 1980s, and a section of terracing was sold off for redevelopment as a supermarket to help pay off the club's rising debts. Bolton Wanderers had dropped into the Third Division in 1983 and later spent a season in the Fourth Division. In January 1990, the &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Report\"&gt;Taylor Report&lt;/a&gt; required all clubs in the first and second tiers of the English league to have an all-seater stadium by the &lt;a href=\"1994-95%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1994-95 season&lt;/a&gt;. Bolton were still in the Third Division at this stage, but were aiming for promotion - which was finally achieved in 1993. By this stage, the club's owners had decided to relocate to a new all-seater stadium away from Burnden Park, and by 1995 had identified a location at &lt;a href=\"Horwich\"&gt;Horwich&lt;/a&gt; as the preferred site of a new stadium.\nThe lead consultant/architect of the project was Lobb Sports, while local firm &lt;a href=\"Bradshaw%20Gass%20%26amp%3B%20Hope\"&gt;Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope&lt;/a&gt; acted as planning supervisors and &lt;a href=\"quantity%20surveyor\"&gt;quantity surveyor&lt;/a&gt;s, the contractor was &lt;a href=\"Birse%20Group\"&gt;Birse Construction&lt;/a&gt;, and Deakin Callard &amp; Partners provided structural engineering services. The value of the contract was \u00a325\u00a0million (US$42.1 million). The stadium is noted for its distinct gabled architecture, first pioneered by the &lt;a href=\"Galpharm%20Stadium\"&gt;John Smith's Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium was opened in 1997 by &lt;a href=\"John%20Prescott\"&gt;John Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; politician who was the &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nThe stadium consists of four stands: The Carrs Pasties (North) Stand at one end; the South Stand (Franking Sense and also the away end) at the other end; the West Stand at one side of the pitch; and the Nat Lofthouse (east) Stand at the other side.\nWhen the stadium was named after long-time team sponsor Reebok in 1997, fans considered the title impersonal and believed that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition considerably lessened after the stadium was built, as fans grew accustomed to the name and were bolstered by Reebok's status as a local company.\nThe Macron title was applied in July 2014 after the Bolton Wanderers club finalised a partnership with the large Italian sportswear brand. In April 2014, long-serving club chairman Phil Gartside stated that he was \"proud\" to be associated with Macron and had \"been very impressed with their [Macron's] passion for football\". A four-year duration was negotiated for the Macron deal and the club had the option to extend at completion.\nWhen the deal with Macron came to an end in August 2018 the stadium was again renamed, this time as the University of Bolton Stadium.\nOther events.\nThe stadium has hosted concerts by &lt;a href=\"Oasis%20%28band%29\"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pink%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elton%20John\"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coldplay\"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Killers\"&gt;The Killers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mix\"&gt;Little Mix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Stewart\"&gt;Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stadium also hosted the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Open\"&gt;UK Open Darts Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; matches with local boxer &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Khan%20%28British%20boxer%29\"&gt;Amir Khan&lt;/a&gt; and in 2011 &lt;a href=\"2010-11%20English%20Premiership%20%28rugby%20union%29%23Round%2020\"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Sale%20Sharks\"&gt;Sale Sharks&lt;/a&gt; lost to &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt;. It will also host group matches and the quarter-final of the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 2021.\nThe venue's Premier Suite is home to the UK's leading amateur mixed martial arts event, Full Contact Contender.\nIn August 2019, the stadium hosted a campaign rally by &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Corbyn\"&gt;Jeremy Corbyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March and April 2021 the stadium held &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Court\"&gt;Crown Court&lt;/a&gt; cases due to the large amount that had built up as a result of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; whilst the actual Courts were closed. In the same year it was a venue for COVID-19 vaccinations.\nSnooker.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2021%20Champion%20of%20Champions\"&gt;2021 Champion of Champions&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the 2021 Cazoo Champion of Champions for the purposes of sponsorship) professional snooker tournament was hosted at the stadium between 15 and 21 November 2021\nRugby League.\nThe stadium has also hosted seven rugby league matches.\nChallenge Cup.\nIn 2018, the stadium hosted the first ever double-header semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;, repeated in 2019. \nBolton Wanderers Free School.\nIn 2014, the club established &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20Free%20School\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers Free School&lt;/a&gt; at the stadium. It was a &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20form\"&gt;sixth form centre&lt;/a&gt; offering sports and related courses for 16- to 19-year-olds, and utilised the facilities of the stadium for most of its teaching and learning. However, this closed in 2017 due to low pupil numbers which made it 'not financially viable'.\nAttendances.\nRecord attendances.\nRecord attendance: 28,353 v &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;, 28 December 2003\nLowest attendance for a competitive match: 1,540 v &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.%20Reserves%20and%20Academy\"&gt;Everton U23s&lt;/a&gt;, 30 August 2016 &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;Football League Trophy, Northern Group Stage, Game One&lt;/a&gt;\nLowest Premier League attendance: 17,014 v &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;, 2 January 2008\nRecord &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; attendance: 26,163 v &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, 14 February 2008 &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;Last 32 1st leg&lt;/a&gt;\nRecord &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; attendance: 23,523 v &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, 12 March 2005 &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;quarter finals&lt;/a&gt;\nRecord &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; Attendance: 18,037 v &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;, 27 October 2004, Third round\nNat Lofthouse statue.\nBolton Wanderers unveiled a bronze statue of their most famous player, &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Lofthouse\"&gt;Nat Lofthouse&lt;/a&gt;, prior to a game against &lt;a href=\"Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Queens Park Rangers&lt;/a&gt; on 24 August 2013.
