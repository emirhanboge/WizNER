The home of French football club &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Olympique Lyonnais&lt;/a&gt;, it replaced their previous stadium, &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Gerland\"&gt;Stade de Gerland&lt;/a&gt;, in January 2016.\nThe stadium was a host of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202016\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and was also chosen to stage the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Coupe%20de%20la%20Ligue%20Final\"&gt;2017 Coupe de la Ligue Final&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2018%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2018 UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the &lt;a href=\"2019%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2019 FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and football at the &lt;a href=\"2024%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2024 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Outside football, the ground has also held &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; matches, as well as musical concerts.\nConstruction.\nOn 1 September 2008, Olympique Lyonnais president &lt;a href=\"Jean-Michel%20Aulas\"&gt;Jean-Michel Aulas&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to create a new 60,000-seat stadium, tentatively called \"OL Land\", to be built on 50 hectares of land located in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A9cines-Charpieu\"&gt;D\u00e9cines-Charpieu&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium would also include state-of-the-art sporting facilities, two hotels, a leisure center, and commercial and business offices.\nOn 13 October 2008, the project was agreed upon by the French government, the &lt;a href=\"General%20councils%20%28France%29\"&gt;General Council of Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lyon\"&gt;Grand Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyon%20Metro\"&gt;SYTRAL&lt;/a&gt;, and the commune of D\u00e9cines for construction with approximately &lt;a href=\"%E2%82%AC\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;180 million of public money being used and between \u20ac60\u201380 million coming from the &lt;a href=\"Urban%20Community%20of%20Lyon\"&gt;Urban Community of Lyon&lt;/a&gt;. The project was hindered by slow administrative procedures, political interests, and various opposition groups who viewed the stadium as financially, ecologically, and socially wrong for the taxpayers and community of D\u00e9cines. After landscaping in 2012, stadium construction started in summer 2013.\nFootball.\n&lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Olympique Lyonnais&lt;/a&gt; played their first game in the new stadium on 9 January 2016, winning 4\u20131 against &lt;a href=\"Troyes%20AC\"&gt;Troyes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Lacazette\"&gt;Alexandre Lacazette&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal at the ground.\nIn November 2009, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;French Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; chose Parc Olympique Lyonnais one of the twelve stadiums to be used in the country's bidding for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202016\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2016&lt;/a&gt;.
