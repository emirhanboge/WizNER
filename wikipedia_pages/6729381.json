    "text": "Roy Little (1 June 1931 \u2013 29 January 2015) was an English &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; right back who was born in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. Once he left school, at age 14, he started working in Rylands. His first professional club was &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;, who he joined from amateur side Greenwood Victoria in August 1949. He did not make his league debut until more than three years later, playing against &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt; in January 1953. He made five further appearances that season, but the following season he displaced &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Hannaway\"&gt;Jack Hannaway&lt;/a&gt; to become first choice full-back. Under the &lt;a href=\"Revie%20Plan\"&gt;Revie Plan&lt;/a&gt;, Little formed a defensive partnership with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Meadows\"&gt;Jimmy Meadows&lt;/a&gt;, as Manchester City reached consecutive FA Cup finals.\nIn the 1955 FA Cup final, against &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;, Little's despairing lunge was unable to prevent &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Milburn\"&gt;Jackie Milburn&lt;/a&gt; from scoring the opening goal after less than a minute. Midway through the first half Little's defensive partner Meadows was lost to injury, and though Manchester City equalised, the final score was a comfortable 3\u20131 win for Newcastle. Though defeated in the 1955 final, Manchester City had another strong season in &lt;a href=\"1955-56%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1955\u201356&lt;/a&gt;. Little was ever-present as City finished fourth in the league and again reached the FA Cup final, in which they faced &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;. This time Manchester City scored an early goal, and by the middle of the second half gained a 3\u20131 lead. A serious injury to Manchester City goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Bert%20Trautmann\"&gt;Bert Trautmann&lt;/a&gt; meant City captain &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Paul\"&gt;Roy Paul&lt;/a&gt; considered putting Little in goal. However, Trautmann insisted upon carrying on, and City held out for the victory, giving Little the first and only major honour of his career. Three days later X-rays found that Trautmann had broken his neck.\nLittle remained a first team regular for two further seasons, but lost his place to &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Sear\"&gt;Cliff Sear&lt;/a&gt; in 1958, and was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a34,850 on 18 October, having played a total of 187 matches for City, scoring two goals. He later played for &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, who had just gained promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of four players to make their Palace debut on the opening day of the 1961\u201362 season. After 38 appearances for the Glaziers, Little ended his football career with a spell as player-manager of &lt;a href=\"Dover%20F.C.\"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter retiring from professional football Little returned to Manchester, and took a job at a &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Manchester\"&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; sports centre in &lt;a href=\"Wythenshawe\"&gt;Wythenshawe&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked for over 25 years until retirement. A university football competition is named in his honour. The current holders are German Society FC who overturned a two-goal deficit against a much fancied Medics outfit to win 3\u20132.\nLittle died on 29 January 2015 in Manchester. He was 83. His obituary was placed in the Manchester Evening News on 2 February 2015.\nHonours.\nAs a player.\nManchester City"
