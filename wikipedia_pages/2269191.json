    "text": "Gustaf Sobin (November 15, 1935 \u2013 July 7, 2005) was a U.S.-born poet and author who spent most of his adult life in France. Originally from Boston, Sobin attended the Choate School, &lt;a href=\"Brown%20University\"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;, and moved to Paris in 1962. Eventually he settled in the village of Goult, &lt;a href=\"Provence\"&gt;Provence&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained for over forty years, publishing more than a dozen books of poetry, four novels, a children's story, and two compilations of essays.\nSobin maintained his expatriate status until his death in July, 2005 of &lt;a href=\"pancreatic%20cancer\"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 69.\nLife and work.\nAfter studies with &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Char\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Char&lt;/a&gt;, Gustaf Sobin developed a poetic style that relies heavily on &lt;a href=\"assonance\"&gt;assonance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"literary%20consonance\"&gt;consonance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other methods of the sonic organization of speech. He published many books across different genres: fiction, essays, and translations (including a translation of &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Michaux\"&gt;Henri Michaux&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Ideograms in China\", a prose poem about Chinese &lt;a href=\"orthography\"&gt;orthography&lt;/a&gt;). More recent translations include \"The Brittle Age\" and \"Returning Upland\", two volumes from Char's work of the mid to late 1960s that Sobin chose to translate in full, published posthumously in 2009, side by side with Char's French text.\nAmong his many books are \"Breath's Burials\" (poetry, New Directions, 1995), \"Luminous Debris\" (1999) and \"Ladder of Shadows\" (2008) (essays, University of California Press), and \"Collected Poetry\" (2010). Among his works of fiction are the novels \"The Fly Truffler\" (about the art of &lt;a href=\"truffle\"&gt;truffle&lt;/a&gt;-hunting in Southern France), and \"In Pursuit of a Vanishing Star\", which is a chronicle of a brief period of &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Garbo\"&gt;Greta Garbo&lt;/a&gt;'s early acting career.\nGustaf Sobin was survived by his wife, Susannah Bott, his daughter Esther, his son Gabriel, an older brother Harris (now deceased), of Phoenix, Arizona, and his devoted cousin, Mikki Ansin of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sobin's brother Harris, an architect and architectural historian, designed the rehabilitation of Gustaf Sobin's residence and two additions for a historic stone &lt;a href=\"cocoonery\"&gt;cocoonery&lt;/a&gt; in Provence, France.\nBefore his death, Sobin named &lt;a href=\"American%20poets\"&gt;U.S. poets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Joron\"&gt;Andrew Joron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Zawacki\"&gt;Andrew Zawacki&lt;/a&gt; as the co-executors of his literary estate."
