In 1988 he was appointed Executive vice president and Head of Investment Banking &amp; Treasury at the Union Bank of Finland. Together with half a dozen of his colleagues Wahlroos bought out the investment banking operations of UBF in 1992 and started the partnership &lt;a href=\"Mandatum\"&gt;Mandatum&lt;/a&gt; &amp; Co, which soon became the leading advisor of mergers and acquisitions in Scandinavia. Through a merger with Interbank in 1998 Mandatum was listed on the &lt;a href=\"Helsinki%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Helsinki Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000 Wahlroos merged his banking group into &lt;a href=\"Danske%20Bank\"&gt;Sampo-Leonia&lt;/a&gt; and took over as President and CEO of the combined company, also becoming its biggest private shareholder. In 2009 Wahlroos resigned as CEO and was elected Chairman of Sampo plc, holding company of &lt;a href=\"Sampo%20Group\"&gt;Sampo Group&lt;/a&gt;, which by then had become the biggest insurer in Northern Europe and also the main shareholder of &lt;a href=\"Nordea\"&gt;Nordea&lt;/a&gt;, the region's largest bank. Between 2011 and 2019 he was chairman of the board of Nordea.\nWahlroos is also Chairman of the Board of &lt;a href=\"UPM%20%28company%29\"&gt;UPM-Kymmene&lt;/a&gt;, the pulp and paper manufacturer.\nPolitics.\nWhile a student, Wahlroos was involved in left-wing politics. He was a member of Finlands Svenska Skolungdomsf\u00f6rbundet in 1969\u20131973 and communist revolutionary student association Sosialistiset taloustieteen opiskelijat in 1971\u20131973. He left extreme leftist politics in 1973. After this he has withdrawn from active party politics although he is a paying member of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20People%27s%20Party%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Swedish People's Party&lt;/a&gt;. He has nevertheless given public comments that give an indication of his thoughts.\nIn 2001, he declared himself in favour of a &lt;a href=\"citizen%27s%20income\"&gt;citizen's income&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. \"Basic security, in my mind, must never be threatened because it is an important part of human modern society\", Wahlroos said in the Finnish newspaper Uutisp\u00e4iv\u00e4 Demari, clearing way to negative income tax thinking. In March 2009 Wahlroos predicted that the economic recession would not endure for long, because the market corrects itself quickly. In March 2010, in an interview in Image magazine, he spoke of the need to cut Finnish development aid because \"we have 50 years of money thrown into a bottomless well\". In addition, he has criticized giving grants to university students because it, according to Wahlroos, \"supports idleness\", and regards agricultural and forestry research expenditures as excessive. In June 2010 Wahlroos told the &lt;a href=\"Financial%20Times\"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; that Europe will have to reconsider the future of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20market%20economy\"&gt;Social market economy&lt;/a&gt; model, because people cannot be taxed in the future in the current fashion, and poverty and broken families are unsustainable. Wahlroos also believes that agricultural subsidies should be abolished throughout the world: \"It is absurd that Finland is with one hand supporting the Zambian agribusiness and the other the EU common agricultural policy. (...) ...giving to developing countries at the same time ... when the EU is to abolish agricultural subsidies and open tariff barriers on agricultural products.\" At the same time he receives remarkable agricultural subsidies himself.\nIn 2015 Wahlroos published a book defending his laissez-faire economics viewpoint, \"De tio s\u00e4msta ekonomiska teorierna. Fr\u00e5n Keynes till Piketty\" (The ten worst economic theories: From &lt;a href=\"John%20Maynard%20Keynes\"&gt;Keynes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Piketty\"&gt;Piketty&lt;/a&gt;). In the book he argues, for instance, that stable economic development is difficult to implement in a democratic social system.\nWahlroos is a member of Libera, a foundation organized under &lt;a href=\"Mont%20Pelerin%20Society\"&gt;Mont Pelerin Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Defence%20Forces\"&gt;Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt;, Wahlroos holds the rank of &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20military%20ranks\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in the reserves.\nBooks published.\nWahlroos, Bj\u00f6rn: \"Markkinat ja demokratia\".
