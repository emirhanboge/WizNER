    "text": "Nigel Foster (born 17 October 1952) is an English &lt;a href=\"sea%20kayak\"&gt;sea kayak&lt;/a&gt;er, &lt;a href=\"kayak\"&gt;kayak&lt;/a&gt; designer, instructor and author. He is the first and youngest paddler to circle &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; by kayak.\nFoster started paddling in &lt;a href=\"Brighton\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, England when he was 15 in a skin-on-frame kayak. At Burwash Place Outdoor Activity Centre, &lt;a href=\"Burwash\"&gt;Burwash&lt;/a&gt;, Sussex, England, Foster learned to handle &lt;a href=\"Whitewater%20kayaking\"&gt;whitewater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20kayak\"&gt;sea kayak&lt;/a&gt;ing and &lt;a href=\"surf%20kayaking\"&gt;surf kayaking&lt;/a&gt;. From 1971 to 1972 he was employed there as a \"trainee instructor\". He enjoyed the mix of Outdoor Activity instruction and Environmental Studies education and decided to pursue this as a career. He attended a three-year teachers training course at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20West%20of%20England\"&gt;Redland College&lt;/a&gt;, Bristol, and gained classroom experience with two years teaching at a school in Buckinghamshire.\nIn 1977, after his Iceland circumnavigation, Foster was employed by &lt;a href=\"East%20Sussex\"&gt;East Sussex&lt;/a&gt; County Council to teach as \"instructor/teacher\" at Burwash Place. Later in 1977 he was promoted to deputy warden.\nAt the same time he continued his explorations with trips that included the Atlantic coast of &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20%28island%29\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; and a voyage from the English Channel through France down to the Mediterranean.\nIn 1981 when the center was closed as part of regional cutbacks to education spending, he was redeployed as a schoolteacher, but resigned in summer 1981 to attempt a major kayak expedition \u2013 a solo trip from &lt;a href=\"Iqaluit\"&gt;Iqaluit&lt;/a&gt; at the SE end of &lt;a href=\"Baffin%20Island\"&gt;Baffin Island&lt;/a&gt; along &lt;a href=\"Frobisher%20Bay\"&gt;Frobisher Bay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Resolution%20Island%20%28Nunavut%29\"&gt;Resolution Island&lt;/a&gt; . He had to cross the of open water in the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20Strait\"&gt;Hudson Strait&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"Lacy%20Island\"&gt;Lacy Island&lt;/a&gt; , northernmost of the &lt;a href=\"Button%20Islands\"&gt;Button Islands&lt;/a&gt; and part of the Northern Coast of &lt;a href=\"Labrador\"&gt;Labrador&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tidal range in this area may exceed while tidal streams may run at more than seven knots. After fighting the tidal streams in the dark near the Button Islands, suffering frostbitten fingers and loss of gear, Foster eventually gave up on this expedition. He was able to catch a ride on an oil tanker that happened to have taken shelter behind &lt;a href=\"Killiniq%20Island\"&gt;Killiniq Island&lt;/a&gt; . The trip was described by the editor of the \"BCU Canoeing Handbook\" in 1989 as \"arguably the most impressive of any sea kayak adventure in the world.\"\nAfter his return to England \u2013 from 1982 to 1985 \u2013 he worked as an instructor at the &lt;a href=\"Plas%20Menai\"&gt;Plas Menai&lt;/a&gt;, National Water Sports Centre, North Wales, primarily instructing kayaking, canoeing, boardsailing, mountaineering, with a little water-skiing, and sailing, gaining the following &lt;a href=\"British%20Canoe%20Union\"&gt;British Canoe Union&lt;/a&gt; (BCU) national qualifications in these fields.\nHe also served for many years on the BCU Sea Touring Committee, and the BCU Expeditions Sub-Committee. \nIn 1985 he left for Iceland for six weeks, helping an expedition group from Cambridge with logistics and leading the kayaking component. He returned to start his own kayaking business. He taught local groups in Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Canada and the United States.\nThe design label \"Foster Rowe\" emerged for a while as a collaboration with two other top kayak coaches, (Andy Middleton &amp; Ray Rowe) with products such as paddling jackets, &lt;a href=\"personal%20flotation%20devices\"&gt;personal flotation devices&lt;/a&gt; (PFDs) and tow-systems designed for leading edge performance.\nSubsequently working alone, the \"Nigel Foster\" signature paddle blade was released by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.nimbuskayaks.com/\"&gt;Nimbus&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, and Foster worked in a design/consultant capacity with companies including &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.liquidlogickayaks.com/\"&gt;Liquidlogic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.bendingbranches.com/\"&gt;Bending Branches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.extrasport.com/\"&gt;Extrasport&lt;/a&gt; in USA.
