    "text": "The Valencia hispanica or Valencia toothcarp () is a species of &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20fish\"&gt;freshwater fish&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Valenciidae\"&gt;Valenciidae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to the south of &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valencian%20Community\"&gt;Valencian Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. There is at least one historical record of this species from near &lt;a href=\"Perpignan\"&gt;Perpignan&lt;/a&gt; in France but the species has been &lt;a href=\"local%20extinction\"&gt;extirpated&lt;/a&gt; from that country.\nIts natural &lt;a href=\"habitat\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt;es, freshwater &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;s, coastal freshwater &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"acequia\"&gt;acequia&lt;/a&gt;s which may connect these. It is threatened by pollution and &lt;a href=\"habitat%20loss\"&gt;habitat loss&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIt is a small fish of a light brown to yellow colour. Adult males oscillate between 4\u20138\u00a0cm and can be distinguished from females in that the rim of their fins is orangish. Also, females are slightly larger than their male counterparts of the same age.\nIt is a gregarious fish forming small shoals. The species is &lt;a href=\"carnivorous\"&gt;carnivorous&lt;/a&gt;, feeding on insects, larvae, worms, etc.\nConservation status.\nValencia toothcarp is listed as an endangered species by Spanish and international legislation. Its populations dwindled as a result of &lt;a href=\"land%20reclamation\"&gt;land reclamation&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon quite intense in Valencia during the 1980s as a part of the touristic boom. The increased human population which followed also brought increased pollution and &lt;a href=\"introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced species&lt;/a&gt;, both factors further damaging the \"samaruc\" populations.\nIt has been recently object of a conservation and &lt;a href=\"reintroduction\"&gt;reintroduction&lt;/a&gt; program carried out by the Environment department of the &lt;a href=\"Generalitat%20Valenciana\"&gt;Valencian regional government&lt;/a&gt; which has sought to reverse further declines."
