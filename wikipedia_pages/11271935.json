    "text": "Charlotta Antonia \"Charlotte Antoinette\" Seuerling (1782/84 \u2013 25 September 1828), was a &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; concert singer, &lt;a href=\"harpsichordist\"&gt;harpsichordist&lt;/a&gt;, composer and poet, known as \"The Blind Song-Maiden\". She was active in Sweden, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and Russia. Her last name is also spelled as \"Seijerling\" and \"Seyerling\". Her first name was Charlotta Antoinetta (or Antonia), but in the French fashion of the time, she was often called Charlotte Antoinette. She was the author of the popular song \"S\u00e5ng i en melankolisk stund\".\nEarly life.\nCharlotta Seuerling was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Gottfried%20Seuerling\"&gt;Carl Gottfried Seuerling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margareta%20Seuerling\"&gt;Margareta Seuerling&lt;/a&gt;, actors and directors of a travelling theatre company. She became blind at the age of four due to an incompetent &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; vaccination. Four years later, at the age of eight, she contracted smallpox, and the scars made people consider her ugly, which made her shy.\nAs a child, she contributed to the household by singing songs she had composed herself to the music of the &lt;a href=\"harp\"&gt;harp&lt;/a&gt; in her parents' theatre. She was widely advertised as a wonder: the singing and music-making blind child. She also played the guitar. Her father was very ambitious and upheld a high standard in the plays at his theatre company, often performing famous plays from the continent, such as plays by Shakespeare. Her mother was a good actress who became the first Swedish speaking Julia in &lt;a href=\"Romeo%20and%20Juliet\"&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Norrk%C3%B6ping\"&gt;Norrk\u00f6ping&lt;/a&gt; in 1776. They toured in both Sweden and Finland, and even performed at the Swedish court on at least one occasion. They were popular among the public, but often had financial difficulties and problems with irregular staff \u2013 during periods of staff-shortage they were forced to use dolls on stage. Charlotta's sister Carolina Fredrika Seuerling was also an actress, but she married a vicar in 1789 and retired.\nCareer.\nAfter the death of her father in 1795, her mother took sole charge of the theatre and moved to &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, where the competition was small, to tour as the director of her troupe. She sent her daughter to &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; to have an eye-operation by the famous doctors Rislachi and af Bjerk\u00e8n, that was promised to give her eyesight back. The operation, however, failed, and as Seuerling did not have the money to join her mother in Finland. She was thereby forced to stay in a boardinghouse for poor women.\nHer musical talent was discovered in 1806 by &lt;a href=\"Per%20Aron%20Borg\"&gt;Per Aron Borg&lt;/a&gt;, who gave piano lessons to the poor women of the boardinghouse piano playing. He was impressed by her ability, and accepted her as his private student in musical theory in 1807, giving her a home with his family. Impressed by her ability to learn, he added more subjects, and soon, she excelled in nature sciences and languages. She also composed her own poems, and created a device by which she could write her poems down. Borg invented a blind-writing, by which she could learn to read notes, German and French. \nShe was uninterested in subjects traditionally given to her gender, and Borg published a pamphlet where he argued that women were capable of learning subjects from which they were banned. Borg also taught her medicine; also in this subject, she was so successful that he argued that women would be equally and even better as medical doctors than men.\nInspired by her ability to learn, Borg founded the first Institute for blind and deaf in Sweden (1808). Seuerling was his first student, and she is sometimes regarded as the first blind student of her country. \nIn 1808, Borg held a demonstration during which Seuerling displayed her ability and talent in reading and writing, playing the harp and clavichord, read notes, speak French and German, as well as weaving, sewing and knitting. During this time period in history, blind and deaf people were often suspected to be unable to educate, and the demonstration of Charlotta Seuerling was of great help to the institute. Her ability attracted attention, and a lot of the support of the newly founded institute is attributed to her.\nOn 5 July 1809, Borg held a public exam for his pupils in front of five hundred guests, among them the queen, &lt;a href=\"Hedvig%20Elisabeth%20Charlotte%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp\"&gt;Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp&lt;/a&gt;. Charlotta Seuerling performed her own song: \"I, who does not enjoy the pleasure to see the treasured Queen\". Upon this, the queen complimented her, and Charlotta, entirely in the taste of the time, dropped her harp and fainted with happiness. She won a great success. The scene was described in a poem by &lt;a href=\"Gustaf%20Snoilsky\"&gt;Gustaf Snoilsky&lt;/a&gt;: \"Upon this the blind songmaiden was moved / and by her gratitute stagger...\", which made her known as the \"Songmaiden\".\nAfter this, the queen became the protector of the institute, and it was also given government support.\nSeuerling wrote the song \"S\u00e5ng i en melankolisk stund\" (English: Song in a Moment of melancholy) for harp music. The song was very popular in Sweden during the entire 19th century. It teams depression, suicide and betrayal, but also of the happiness of friendship and the hope it gives, interpreted as her own feelings when she was given tuition by P\u00e4r Aron Borg and her life changed. It begins: \"No ray of light shine from above, the night was terrifying and darkness surrounded me...\", and ends: \"...then as the first ray of dawn a light broke through the mist and friendship came; and with its radiance calm and joy filled my heart.\"\nIn 1810, Seuerling joined her mother in Finland, which was now a part of Russia, and performed in her mother's theatre troupe. In 1811, her mother met with financial difficulties. They were then both put under the protection of the Russian empress dowager, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Sophie%20Dorothea%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg%29\"&gt;Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)&lt;/a&gt;, who had heard of Seuerlings reputation as a harpist, and each received a pension of 600 rubles. Charlotta moved to Russia, where she assisted in the development of &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20Ha%C3%BCy\"&gt;Valentin Ha\u00fcy&lt;/a&gt;s Institute for the Blind in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, where she received a position.\nDeath and legacy.\nSeuerling returned to Sweden in 1823, and died five years later.\nSeuerling's harp, letters, and poems written by her hand are kept at &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20Music%20Museum\"&gt;Stockholm Music Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Among her writings are also kept a writing test, which is the oldest example of blind text in Sweden, written with a writing device constructed for the blind before &lt;a href=\"Braille\"&gt;Braille&lt;/a&gt;, kept at &lt;a href=\"Kungliga%20biblioteket\"&gt;Kungliga biblioteket&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer song \"S\u00e5ng i en melankolisk stund\" was published anonymously many times after 1828, and with her name in the song book \"Miniaturvisbok\" (1852) alongside work by &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Olof%20Wallin\"&gt;Johan Olof Wallin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fredrika%20Bremer\"&gt;Fredrika Bremer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%20Wennerberg\"&gt;Gunnar Wennerberg&lt;/a&gt;."
