    "text": "The Barbara Jordan Health Policy Scholars Program was a health policy internship program sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Kaiser%20Family%20Foundation\"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt; from 2000 to 2012. The program was based at &lt;a href=\"Howard%20University\"&gt;Howard University&lt;/a&gt; and sponsored an annual group of senior undergraduates and recent graduates to work in &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; offices and learn about health policy. It was named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Jordan\"&gt;Barbara Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; woman elected from the U.S. South to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, and a former &lt;a href=\"trustee\"&gt;trustee&lt;/a&gt; of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Its goal was to expand the number of &lt;a href=\"Person%20of%20color\"&gt;people of color&lt;/a&gt; in the healthy policy field. Over 170 people participated in the program over its course. The last class was in 2012."
