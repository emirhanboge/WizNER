    "text": "Mount Parnitha (, , &lt;a href=\"Katharevousa\"&gt;Katharevousa&lt;/a&gt; and \"Parnis\"/\"Parnes\"; sometimes Parnetha) is a densely forested &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; range north of &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, the highest on the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Attica\"&gt;Attica&lt;/a&gt;, with an elevation of 1,413 m, and a summit known as Karavola (\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1). Much of the mountain is designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20parks%20in%20Greece\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;, and is a protected habitat for &lt;a href=\"wildfowl\"&gt;wildfowl&lt;/a&gt;, first created in 1961. The summit is located 18\u00a0km north of Acharnae and about 30\u00a0km north of Athens city centre, while the mountain covers approximately 250\u00a0km\u00b2 of land. Other peaks include Mavrovouni (\u039c\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9), Ornio (1,350 m), Area (1,160 m), Avgo or Avgho (1,150 m), and Xerovouni (\u039e\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9, meaning \"dry mountain\": 1,120 m). It also has two shelters &lt;a href=\"Mpafi\"&gt;Mpafi&lt;/a&gt; and Flampouri. The name of the mountain dates back to &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient times&lt;/a&gt;, when it was under the ancient &lt;a href=\"deme\"&gt;deme&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Acharnae\"&gt;Acharnae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decelea\"&gt;Decelea&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nTowns surrounding the mountain include &lt;a href=\"Aspropyrgos\"&gt;Aspropyrgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyli\"&gt;Fyli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acharnes\"&gt;Acharnes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varymbombi\"&gt;Varymbombi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrakomakedones\"&gt;Thrakomakedones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dekeleia\"&gt;Dekeleia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avlonas%2C%20Attica\"&gt;Avlona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agios%20Stefanos%2C%20Attica\"&gt;Agios Stefanos&lt;/a&gt; as well as the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Agios%20Merkourios\"&gt;Agios Merkourios&lt;/a&gt;. The highway &lt;a href=\"Greek%20National%20Road%201\"&gt;GR-1&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E75\"&gt;E75&lt;/a&gt;) surrounds the northern and eastern part of the mountain along with the &lt;a href=\"Cephissus%20%28Athenian%20plain%29\"&gt;Cephissus&lt;/a&gt; river, while the &lt;a href=\"Attiki%20Odos\"&gt;Attiki Odos&lt;/a&gt; motorway (GR-6) runs to its south. The mountain offers panoramic views of the mountains northeast of Parnitha, &lt;a href=\"Penteli\"&gt;Penteli&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the &lt;a href=\"Ymittos\"&gt;Ymittos&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, the &lt;a href=\"Aigaleo%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Aigaleo&lt;/a&gt; to the south and another to the west; from its summit, one can also see the &lt;a href=\"Thriasian%20Plain\"&gt;Thriasian Plain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Saronic%20Gulf\"&gt;Saronic Gulf&lt;/a&gt; including the islands of &lt;a href=\"Salamis%20Island\"&gt;Salamina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aigina\"&gt;Aigina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Euboean%20Gulf\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Euboean%20Gulf\"&gt;South Euboean Gulf&lt;/a&gt;s and island of &lt;a href=\"Euboea\"&gt;Euboea&lt;/a&gt;, and most of central and northern Greater Athens. The view during clear days can extend to northern &lt;a href=\"Boeotia\"&gt;Boeotia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Peloponnese\"&gt;Peloponnese&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nParnitha mountain has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate with frequent snowfalls in winter and pleasant temperatures in summer. The mountain is significantly wetter than areas of east and southern Attica.\nThe mountain was also affected by several major blizzards, including two in 2005 and 2006, stranding cars and closing roads, as well as the cable car.\nEcology.\nForests of &lt;a href=\"Aleppo%20Pine\"&gt;Aleppo Pine&lt;/a&gt; cover all slopes beneath 1,000 m altitude, and are often threatened by forest fires, such as happened in 2005 and 2007. Above 1,000 m it is covered principally in &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Fir\"&gt;Greek Fir&lt;/a&gt;, grasses and &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;bery, and beneath 300 m mainly farmlands and suburban housing to the east. About 1,000 species of plants can be found on the mountain, including &lt;a href=\"crocus\"&gt;crocus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tulips\"&gt;tulips&lt;/a&gt;, and the mountain also provides a native habitat to its &lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cervus elaphus\"), which were known in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient times&lt;/a&gt;. After the traumatic fire in 2007 (\"see below\"), they are even scarcer. Several large mines lie to the northwest, and the ore from them was shipped to a nearby factory in industrial areas.\nHistorical monuments and places of interest.\nParnitha has several places of archaeological interest. In antiquity, several fortresses had been built on the mountain, for the defense of the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Attica\"&gt;Attica&lt;/a&gt; and more specifically &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Classical Athens&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Boeotians\"&gt;Boeotians&lt;/a&gt; and others enemies from the north. Today some fortresses are kept in good condition such as the &lt;a href=\"Phyle%20%28Attica%29\"&gt;Phyle&lt;/a&gt; fortress, at a height of 687 meters in the west of Parnitha. Other notable fortresses are the &lt;a href=\"Panakton\"&gt;Panakton&lt;/a&gt;, in the area of &lt;a href=\"Dervenochoria\"&gt;Dervenochoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eleutherae\"&gt;Eleutherae&lt;/a&gt; fortress near Mount &lt;a href=\"Cithaeron\"&gt;Cithaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dekeleia\"&gt;Dekeleia&lt;/a&gt; was also an important fortress on the site of modern-day former royal palace in &lt;a href=\"Tatoi\"&gt;Tatoi&lt;/a&gt;, and the fort of Limiko was situated deep inside the mountain, just north of its peak. \nA notable monument of later periods is the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Kleiston\"&gt;Monastery of Kleiston&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; monastery dated from 13th century. It is mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Innocent%20IV\"&gt;Pope Innocent IV&lt;/a&gt; in 1209 with the name Monastery of Kyras. Southeast of Parnitha, in a dense forest, is &lt;a href=\"Tatoi%20Palace\"&gt;Tatoi Palace&lt;/a&gt;. It was the palace of the Greek royal family and it was built in 19th century. Today it is abandoned.\nParnitha has also natural monuments. The cave of Panas is on the west slopes of the mountain at a height of 750 meters. It was a worship site in antiquity. Near the cave there is the steep gorge of Gouras and the gorge of Keladonas river. A beautiful site of the mountain is &lt;a href=\"Beletsi%20Lake\"&gt;Beletsi Lake&lt;/a&gt;, on the east slopes of the mountain, near &lt;a href=\"Afidnes\"&gt;Afidnes&lt;/a&gt;, and it is important place for migratory birds.\nModern facilities.\nA casino, the &lt;a href=\"Mont%20Parnes%20Casino\"&gt;Mont Parnes Casino&lt;/a&gt;, is located near the top of the mountain and is served by a &lt;a href=\"Parnitha%20Funitel\"&gt;suspended cable car&lt;/a&gt;. Two shelters are also on Parnitha, the most known of which is &lt;a href=\"Mpafi\"&gt;Mpafi&lt;/a&gt;. A series of trails are found around the mountain as well as forest roads, and also on the mountain is Athens' second transmitter, broadcasting radio and television since the mid-1950s, across the range of &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20Greece\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; channels from &lt;a href=\"Ellinik%C3%AD%20Radiofon%C3%ADa%20Tile%C3%B3rasi\"&gt;ERT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ANT1\"&gt;ANT1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mega%20Channel\"&gt;Mega&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Channel\"&gt;Alter&lt;/a&gt; and more, to satellite, including &lt;a href=\"Super%20Sport%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Super Sport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seven%20X\"&gt;Seven X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Filmnet\"&gt;Filmnet&lt;/a&gt;, and a multitude of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20radio%20stations%20in%20Greece\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"ERA%20Radio\"&gt;ERA Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Klik%20FM\"&gt;Klik FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ANT1%20Radio\"&gt;ANT1 Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ciao%20FM\"&gt;Ciao FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhythmos\"&gt;Rhythmos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Sport%20FM\"&gt;Super Sport FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Top%20FM\"&gt;Top FM&lt;/a&gt; and others. The supporting road connection was paved in the mid-20th century.\n2007 wildfire.\nParnitha suffered extensive damage from a &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, 28 June 2007 around the morning and noon hours, continuing for several days and burning approximately 56\u00a0km\u00b2 of land; one of the worst recorded wildfires in the prefecture after that of &lt;a href=\"Penteli\"&gt;Penteli&lt;/a&gt;. The magnitude of the devastation was unforeseen. A smaller fire had, however, taken place in the 1960s.\nThe fire consumed dozens of acres of forest across two prefectures. Firefighters, helicopters, and planes were brought into action across the mountain area and its edges fighting the enormous blaze, which took days to contain. It spread rapidly with the help of intense winds, and intensified into the northwestern edges of &lt;a href=\"Attica\"&gt;Greater Athens&lt;/a&gt;, including both &lt;a href=\"Ano%20Liosia\"&gt;Ano Liosia&lt;/a&gt; and towns and villages such as &lt;a href=\"Fyli%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Fyli&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Thrakomakedones\"&gt;Thrakomakedones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyli%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Pyli&lt;/a&gt; and both Skoura and &lt;a href=\"Schimatari\"&gt;Schimatari&lt;/a&gt; north of the mountain. From Athens, inhabitants could see the mountainside burning throughout the night. In Schimatari in Boeotia, it ruined several acres of forest and businesses. The fire claimed 80% of the rare Greek Fir and Aleppo Pine forest, 150 animals of the red deer population (an endangered species), birds, and other rare animals. The remains of the green firs and pines are scattered around its edges. The smoke from the massive destruction formed a line that traveled east over Attica, southern &lt;a href=\"Euboea\"&gt;Euboea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chios\"&gt;Chios&lt;/a&gt;, to the edge of &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 350\u00a0km away.\nOn June 30, the fire was mostly contained and warnings of new fires were reduced, as only a few fires were slowly burning sporadically in separate parts of the mountain. The main blaze was completely put out on July 1. At the edges of the burnt parts, several fires slowly continued to burn in sections after June 30, with a slow expansion.\nScientists estimate that the area's recovery time may be as long as a century. They predict the effect of the loss will only begin to be felt in the coming years; the air may become a little stale and the already known problems of air pollution and smog in Athens may reappear and intensify. Temperatures could also rise and flooding may become a problem for several years. The Ministry of Environment is currently considering a conclusive reforestation program, while many citizens marched on the streets of Athens to express their disapproval of the handling of the situation. More recently, reforestation has been underway, and the government will be receiving tens of thousands of trees to be planted around the mountains, most of them from outside the country, albeit at a small scale thus far.\nInvestigations are still underway as to the fire's cause. One scenario suggests a transformer belonging to a major power line exploded due to overuse and overheating by the 47C heatwave, some days before the fire. Another holds that this was one of the many arson attacks that have claimed forested land in Greece over recent decades to illegally clear formerly-protected land for expanded real estate."
