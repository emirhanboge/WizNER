    "text": "The Helio Aircraft Company was an American aircraft manufacturer founded in 1948.\nHistory.\nThe Koppen-Bollinger Aircraft Corporation was founded by &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Koppen\"&gt;Otto Koppen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lynn%20Bollinger\"&gt;Lynn Bollinger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; in 1948 to develop a light &lt;a href=\"STOL\"&gt;STOL&lt;/a&gt; utility aircraft. Initially located at &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Metropolitan%20Airport\"&gt;Boston Metropolitan Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canton%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Canton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, it was renamed the Helio Aircraft Corporation by the time manufacture of the &lt;a href=\"Helio%20Courier\"&gt;Helio Courier&lt;/a&gt; commenced in the early 1950s at a plant in &lt;a href=\"Pittsburg%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Pittsburg, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. The plant, located at the &lt;a href=\"Atkinson%20Municipal%20Airport\"&gt;Atkinson Municipal Airport&lt;/a&gt; was acquired by Helio from Mid-States Manufacturing Company in July 1956 and was almost destroyed by a wildfire in March 1966. In 1959, the company announced it was moving its factory to &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe business was bought by the &lt;a href=\"General%20Aircraft%20Corporation\"&gt;General Aircraft Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in 1969, was renamed Helio Aircraft Company and continued production until 1974, when General Aircraft commenced legal proceedings against the &lt;a href=\"CIA\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the agency had planned to ruin the business through organizing unlicensed production of the Courier.\nThe production rights were sold by General Aircraft to Helio Aircraft Ltd in 1977. Despite an abortive attempt to restart production, the company remained essentially inactive until 1980. The Courier was returned to production, but only 18 aircraft were built. In 1984, the company was forced to layoff 100 workers and the following February it was evicted from its factory.\nThe rights to the Courier and &lt;a href=\"Helio%20Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; were bought and sold a number of times more before being purchased by Helio Aircraft LLC of &lt;a href=\"Prescott%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Prescott, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, which announced plans in 2004 to return both types to production."
