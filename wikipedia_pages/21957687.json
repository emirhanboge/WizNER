    "text": "Kevin Richard Kobel (born October 2, 1953) is a former professional baseball &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. Having made his major league debut with the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; a month shy of his twentieth birthday on September 8, , he is the only pitcher in franchise history to make his major league debut as a teenager.\nCareer.\nKobel was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Francis%20High%20School%20%28Athol%20Springs%2C%20New%20York%29\"&gt;Saint Francis High School&lt;/a&gt; in Athol Springs, New York in the eleventh round (250th overall) of the &lt;a href=\"1971%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20Draft\"&gt;1971 Major League Baseball Draft&lt;/a&gt;. After three seasons in their &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt;, in which he went 20\u201324 with a 3.60 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt;, Kobel joined the Brewers as a September call-up in 1973. He began his major league career with a perfect inning of work in which he struck out the first two &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; batters he faced and induced a weak ground ball to first base from the third. In his second inning, however, he surrendered a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; to light hitting &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Stanley%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Fred Stanley&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis first major league win also came against the Yankees on May 12, . Kobel held the Yankees scoreless on two &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; through seven innings in the rain delayed second game of a &lt;a href=\"doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shea%20Stadium\"&gt;Shea Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. After surrendering a &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Dempsey\"&gt;Rick Dempsey&lt;/a&gt; to lead off the eighth, the game was called due to rain. Kobel spent the entire 1974 season in the majors, compiling a 6\u201314 record and 3.99 ERA. He seemed to be at his best against the Yankees, as his ERA against the Yankees was 2.10, and three of those six wins were at their expense.\nHe developed arm troubles that limited him to thirty innings for the triple A &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%20Solons\"&gt;Sacramento Solons&lt;/a&gt; in . He remained a minor leaguer with the Brewers until receiving a second September call-up in . Following a season spent in the minors, his contract was purchased by the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched parts of three seasons for the Mets, in which he went 12\u201318 with a 3.58 ERA. On June 17, , he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"player%20to%20be%20named%20later\"&gt;player to be named later&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in eight games for the triple A &lt;a href=\"Omaha%20Royals\"&gt;Omaha Royals&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched briefly for the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt;' triple A affiliate, the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Beavers\"&gt;Portland Beavers&lt;/a&gt;, in .\nExternal links.\n, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.azmla.com/kobelstats.html\"&gt;Arizona Major League Alumni&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ultimatemets.com/profile.php%3FPlayerCode%3D0271\"&gt;The Ultimate Mets Database&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkobek101.htm\"&gt;Retrosheet&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//estadisticaslmb.com/DetalleJugador.aspx%3FIdJugador%3D6062%26amp%3BEsPitcher%3D1\"&gt;Mexican League&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.pelotabinaria.com.ve/beisbol/mostrar.php%3FID%3Dkobekev001\"&gt;Venezuelan Professional Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;"
