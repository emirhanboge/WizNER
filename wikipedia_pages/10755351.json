    "text": "The Amber Witch is a German novel published by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Meinhold\"&gt;Wilhelm Meinhold&lt;/a&gt; (1797\u20131851) in 1838. Its German title is \"Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe\". The novel was originally published as a &lt;a href=\"Literary%20forgery\"&gt;literary hoax&lt;/a&gt; which purported to be an actual 17th-century &lt;a href=\"chronicle\"&gt;chronicle&lt;/a&gt;. Meinhold later admitted to the hoax but had some difficulty in proving that he was its author. In 1844, it was published in Britain as \"The Amber Witch\" in two English translations: one by E. A. Friedlander and another, more enduring, translation by &lt;a href=\"Lucie%2C%20Lady%20Duff-Gordon\"&gt;Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Duff Gordon's translation was very popular with the Victorians and went through numerous editions, including a luxurious one in 1895 illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Burne-Jones\"&gt;Philip Burne-Jones&lt;/a&gt;. The novel was a favourite of &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Wilde\"&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;/a&gt;'s when he was a boy, and in 1861 it was made into an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Amber%20Witch%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Amber Witch&lt;/a&gt;\", composed by &lt;a href=\"William%20Vincent%20Wallace\"&gt;William Vincent Wallace&lt;/a&gt;. Wallace's opera has faded into obscurity, but the novel on which it was based has continued to be republished, both on its own and in anthologies.\nBackground.\nMeinhold claimed to have discovered a manuscript written by a 17th-century minister, Abraham Schweidler (purportedly a pastor of &lt;a href=\"Coserow\"&gt;Coserow&lt;/a&gt; and known for his fire and brimstone &lt;a href=\"sermon\"&gt;sermon&lt;/a&gt;s) amongst rubbish in the choir of the old Coserow church. The manuscript contained the story of the pastor's daughter Maria, the \"Amber Witch\".\nThe tale was described by Meinhold, in the subtitle of the novel, as \"the most interesting trial for &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; ever known\". When it first appeared, almost all of the German critics believed it was an authentic historical document. \nThe work attracted critical notice, not only for the dramatic nature of its narrative but also for disputes about which parts of it were original and which were Meinhold's reconstructions, written in imitation of the 17th-century style.\nMeinhold's intention was to set a trap for the disciples of &lt;a href=\"David%20Strauss\"&gt;David Strauss&lt;/a&gt; and his school, who pronounced the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; to be a collection of legends from historical research assisted by internal evidence. In a direct challenge to these \"modern documentary critics\", Meinhold wrote in his preface to \"The Amber Witch\":\nOnly in a later edition did the author admit that the tale was entirely imaginary. His admission that it was a hoax was at first rejected but was soon accepted as the truth. As \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote in the late 1840s:\nThe hoax was done with great skill and attention to detail, using language that would have been used in 17th-century Germany.\nWriter &lt;a href=\"Seabury%20Quinn\"&gt;Seabury Quinn&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article in the August 1925 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Weird%20Tales\"&gt;Weird Tales&lt;/a&gt;\" in which, unaware of the hoax, he recounted the plot of \"The Amber Witch\" as if it were an actual historical event.\nPlot.\nThe story is set during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. The purported author, Reverend Abraham Schweidler, almost loses his only child, Maria, to a plot by a rejected suitor, Sheriff Appelmann, who has accused Maria of practicing &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;. In this he was aided by an evil and jealous woman of the neighborhood.\nAfter a trial and under threat of the most dire torture, Maria, wholly innocent of the crime, confesses. While on her way to the stake, she is rescued by a courageous young nobleman who loves her and who exposes the evil plot against her."
