    "text": "Naja al-Kasaki, or Nadja was a lieutenant serving under the Emir of &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sayf%20al-Dawla\"&gt;Sayf al-Dawla&lt;/a&gt;, during the tenth Century. In the spring of 958, al-Dawla sent Naja to the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;Jazira&lt;/a&gt; in order to confront an invading &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; force led by the general and future emperor &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20Tzimiskes\"&gt;John I Tzimiskes&lt;/a&gt;. Commanding an army some 10,000 men strong, Naja was soundly defeated by Tzimiskes, who continued to march through the Jazira unopposed, even going on to capture &lt;a href=\"Samosata\"&gt;Samosata&lt;/a&gt; and defeat al-Dawla himself in battle. In 960, in an attempt to abuse the absence of a Byzantine presence in the east, following their &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Chandax\"&gt;assault on Crete&lt;/a&gt;, al-Dawla sent Naja to assault the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20people\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; fort of Turn\u012bq, where he won a victory against the commander of &lt;a href=\"Hanzit\"&gt;Hanzit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patrikios%20Michael\"&gt;Patrikios Michael&lt;/a&gt;. The next year, Naja once again raided into Armenia, where he defeated the Emir of &lt;a href=\"Melitene\"&gt;Melitene&lt;/a&gt;, 'Abd Allah, who had accepted Byzantine vassalage. In September of 963, Naja raided around Melitene again. In the same year, Naja was sent to subdue an internal rebellion led by the former governor of Harran, Hibat Allah. After defeating the rebel, Naja himself turned against al-Dawla, swiftly moving towards &lt;a href=\"Mayyafariqin\"&gt;Mayyafariqin&lt;/a&gt;. Naja failed to take the city, however, and he soon retreated to Armenia where he managed to capture a few fortresses around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Van\"&gt;Lake Van&lt;/a&gt;. In fall 964, Naja again failed to take Mayyafariqin, and soon resubmitted to the authority of al-Dawla. He was murdered in Mayyafariqin during the winter of 965."
