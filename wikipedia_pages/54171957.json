The series is set in Hanseong (present-day &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;) in the early 1900s, and focuses on activists fighting for Korea's independence.\nThe series aired every Saturday and Sunday on &lt;a href=\"tvN\"&gt;tvN&lt;/a&gt; starting from July 7, 2018, and ended on September 30, 2018. It premiered internationally on &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe series is the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20drama%23List%20of%20highest-rated%20series%20on%20cable%20television\"&gt;sixth highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history&lt;/a&gt;, with its final episode reached 18.129% and netting an average rating of 12.955%, which is the second highest average rating ever recorded for cable television. It received critical acclaim for its cinematography and storytelling but was also criticized for inaccurate portrayal of historical facts, with some even accusing it of being \"&lt;a href=\"Chinilpa\"&gt;pro-Japanese&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSynopsis.\n\"Mr. Sunshine\" centres around Eugene Choi (&lt;a href=\"Lee%20Byung-hun\"&gt;Lee Byung-hun&lt;/a&gt;), who was born into slavery in &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Empire\"&gt;Joseon&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping to the United States after the 1871 &lt;a href=\"Shinmiyangyo\"&gt;Shinmiyangyo&lt;/a&gt;, he becomes a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt; officer.\nWhen he returns to Joseon for a mission, Eugene meets and falls in love with an aristocrat's granddaughter, Go Ae-shin (&lt;a href=\"Kim%20Tae-ri\"&gt;Kim Tae-ri&lt;/a&gt;), who is part of the &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20army\"&gt;Righteous Army&lt;/a&gt;. However, their love is challenged by their &lt;a href=\"Society%20in%20the%20Joseon%20Dynasty\"&gt;different classes&lt;/a&gt; and the presence of Kim Hui-seong (&lt;a href=\"Byun%20Yo-han\"&gt;Byun Yo-han&lt;/a&gt;), a nobleman who has been Ae-shin's betrothed since childhood. Eugene also encounters Goo Dong-mae (&lt;a href=\"Yoo%20Yeon-seok\"&gt;Yoo Yeon-seok&lt;/a&gt;), a ruthless samurai, and Kudo Hina (&lt;a href=\"Kim%20Min-jung%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Kim Min-jung&lt;/a&gt;), owner of the popular \"Glory Hotel\" where Eugene stays. At the same time, he discovers a plot by the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Empire of Japan&lt;/a&gt; to colonize &lt;a href=\"Joseon\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; and soon becomes embroiled in the fight for Joseon's sovereignty.\nHistorical background.\nUnlike most &lt;a href=\"Sageuk\"&gt;Sageuk&lt;/a&gt; dramas dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japanese occupation of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mr. Sunshine\" takes place before the &lt;a href=\"Japan%E2%80%93Korea%20Treaty%20of%201910\"&gt;Japanese annexation&lt;/a&gt;, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has a heavy focus on the Righteous Army and depicts the lives of people who fought for Joseon's freedom. Real-life historical events such as Shinmiyangyo, the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Spanish-American War&lt;/a&gt;, the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Myeongseong\"&gt;Empress Myeongseong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Russo-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gojong%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Gojong&lt;/a&gt;'s forced abdication, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Namdaemun\"&gt;Battle of Namdaemun&lt;/a&gt; are portrayed or mentioned.\nHistorical figures such as Emperor Gojong, &lt;a href=\"It%C5%8D%20Hirobumi\"&gt;Ito Hirobumi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hayashi%20Gonsuke%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Hayashi Gonsuke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hasegawa%20Yoshimichi\"&gt;Yoshimichi Hasegawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Newton%20Allen\"&gt;Horace Newton Allen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Eulsa%20Traitors\"&gt;Five Eulsa Traitors&lt;/a&gt; appear as recurring characters, with others, such as &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Changho\"&gt;Ahn Chang-ho&lt;/a&gt;, , , and &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Arthur%20MacKenzie\"&gt;Frederick Arthur MacKenzie&lt;/a&gt;, also making cameo appearances.\nOriginal soundtrack.\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\nPart 6\nPart 7\nPart 8\nPart 9\nPart 10\nPart 11\nPart 12\nPart 13\nPart 14\nPart 15\nReception.\nCritics praised the drama for its \"deep storytelling\" and its ability to raise viewers' awareness of history.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Korea%20Times\"&gt;The Korea Times&lt;/a&gt;\" applauded the drama for shedding light on those deemed peripheral in society, such as women and the lower classes, and for successfully laying out contradictions and hope in the fast-evolving late &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20period\"&gt;Joseon period&lt;/a&gt;; it also praised the show's strong female characters. &lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Time\"&lt;/a&gt;'s Kat Moon chose the show as one of the 10 \"Best Korean Dramas to Watch on Netflix\" and argued, \"Besides serving up stunning cinematography, the show introduces two of the most dynamic female leads from the K-drama world\". &lt;a href=\"Collider%20%28website%29\"&gt;Collider&lt;/a&gt;'s Devon Forward listed it as one of the 28 \"Best Korean Dramas on Netflix Right Now\".\nCriticism.\nThe series has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of Joseon's culture. In particular, the character Goo Dong-mae, who is portrayed as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Society\"&gt;Black Dragon Society&lt;/a&gt;, a pro-Japanese organization, was criticized, with many feeling that the series tried to justify his actions against &lt;a href=\"Joseon\"&gt;Joseon&lt;/a&gt;. However, the series has also been criticized for the exact opposite: enforcing stereotypes of the Japanese as villains and Americans as heroes.\nThe production house of \"Mr. Sunshine\" responded to the criticisms by stating that the organizations and characters portrayed in the series are fictional and that they will modify the character description of Goo Dong-mae accordingly. The Black Dragon Society was changed to a fictional organization, the Musin Society.\nViewership.\n\"Mr. Sunshine\" recorded the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20drama%23List%20of%20highest-rated%20series%20on%20cable%20television\"&gt;6th highest ratings for cable television&lt;/a&gt; with its final episode reaching 18.129% and netting an average rating of 12.955%, which is the second highest average rating ever recorded for cable television. An 8.9% viewership rating was recorded nationwide for the series' first episode. At the time, it was the highest premiere rating in the &lt;a href=\"TvN\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt;'s history, but was surpassed three years later by \"&lt;a href=\"Hospital%20Playlist%23Season%202\"&gt;Hospital Playlist 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe drama aired on a cable channel/pay TV which normally has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;KBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Munhwa%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;MBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Educational%20Broadcasting%20System\"&gt;EBS&lt;/a&gt;)."
