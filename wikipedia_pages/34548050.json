It was introduced in 1986 and was originally called the Satellite Tour, before being renamed with its present title in 1990.\nTournament schedule.\nThe 2012 schedule is set out below. The numbers in brackets after winners' names show the player's total number of wins on the Challenge Tour including that event.
