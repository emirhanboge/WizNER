    "text": "Kung Karls jakt (English: \"King Charles' Hunt\"; Finnish: \"Kaarle-kuninkaan mets\u00e4stys\") is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; with music by &lt;a href=\"Fredrik%20Pacius\"&gt;Fredrik Pacius&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Zacharias%20Topelius\"&gt;Zacharias Topelius&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first opera to be composed in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. \"Kung Karls jakt\" was first performed in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March 1852. Although the text is in &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; (Swedish and Finnish are both official languages in Finland) it concerns an event from Finnish history when Finland was a province of Sweden in the 17th century. The work takes the form of a &lt;a href=\"Singspiel\"&gt;Singspiel&lt;/a&gt; with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers (the king himself does not sing). The music is heavily influenced by contemporary German and Italian opera, with a few Finnish elements such as the use of a \"&lt;a href=\"kantele\"&gt;kantele&lt;/a&gt;\" in one scene.\nSynopsis.\nThe plot concerns the visit of the young &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XI%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;King Charles XI&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"%C3%85land\"&gt;\u00c5land&lt;/a&gt; to go hunting. Leonora, the daughter of a local fisherman, learns of a plot against the king's life and saves him. In return, the king spares the life of her fianc\u00e9 Jonathan, who has been condemned to death for killing one of the royal elks."
