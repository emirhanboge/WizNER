    "text": "Chen Wen Hsi (; 1906\u20131991) was a Chinese-born Singaporean artist, known for his &lt;a href=\"avant-garde\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; Chinese paintings.\nEarly life and education.\nChen was born in &lt;a href=\"Jieyang\"&gt;Jieyang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guangdong\"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt;, China, and had his early education at Chen Li Primary School and St. Joseph Middle School.\nAfter graduation from secondary school, Chen decided to study full-time in fine art at the &lt;a href=\"Shanghai%20College%20of%20Art\"&gt;Shanghai College of Art&lt;/a&gt; in 1928, despite his uncle's objection. Unhappy with the college, Chen transferred to the Xinhua College of Art in Shanghai, where he was taught by renowned artists such as &lt;a href=\"Pan%20Tianshou\"&gt;Pan Tianshou&lt;/a&gt;, with half of his classmates a year later. It was at Xinhua where he became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Jen%20Hao\"&gt;Chen Jen Hao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Chong%20Swee\"&gt;Chen Chong Swee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Kang%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Liu Kang&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom were to become Singapore's Nanyang pioneer artists and art educationists. After four years at Xinhua, Chen graduated and returned to Jieyang.\nCareer.\nAfter getting married in Jieyang, Chen went to &lt;a href=\"Shantou\"&gt;Shantou&lt;/a&gt; in 1929, at the age of 21. His work was exhibited in Shanghai (1931, 1933) and &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; (1932, 1936). In 1937, he received recognition and praise of Chinese painter &lt;a href=\"Xu%20Beihong\"&gt;Xu Beihong&lt;/a&gt; at the second Chinese National Art Exhibition in &lt;a href=\"Nanjing\"&gt;Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;. In the same year, an English arts magazine elected him as one of contemporary China's ten greatest artists. He left China in 1947 and had further exhibitions in &lt;a href=\"Saigon\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt; (1948), Hong Kong (1949), &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt; (1949), and &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;-Singapore (1950).\nIn 1948, Chen arrived in Singapore, where he originally planned to stay for not more than three months. After his visa expired he was convinced by fellow artists such as &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Kang%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Liu Kang&lt;/a&gt;, and then commissioner general Malcolm MacDonald to stay.\nIn Singapore, he proceeded to teach art at &lt;a href=\"The%20Chinese%20High%20School\"&gt;The Chinese High School&lt;/a&gt; (1949\u20131968) and the &lt;a href=\"Nanyang%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt; (1951\u20131959). Chen travelled to various places in Southeast Asia to collect drawing materials during his &lt;a href=\"Tourism\"&gt;vacations&lt;/a&gt;, and he was especially inspired by the people and &lt;a href=\"Norm%20%28sociology%29\"&gt;custom&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1955, Chen took part in a seven-artist group exhibition organised by the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Art%20Society\"&gt;Singapore Art Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1968, Chen retired from &lt;a href=\"Teacher\"&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to concentrate on drawing. Between 1923 and 1992, he conducted 38 one-man exhibitions in Singapore and other countries such as China, &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and Hong Kong.\nStyle.\nChen was proficient in both traditional &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20painting\"&gt;Chinese ink&lt;/a&gt; and Western &lt;a href=\"oil%20painting\"&gt;oil painting&lt;/a&gt;, and experimented with a variety of styles ranging from &lt;a href=\"Fauvism\"&gt;Fauvism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cubism\"&gt;Cubism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Chen's exhibition held in May 1956, Sullivan noted his fascination for \"man-made things and clutter\". The artist loved to experiment with the interplay of light and forms in chaotic subjects, like a &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20yard\"&gt;junkyard&lt;/a&gt;. His unique style which showed \"interest in angles but not Cubist; strays not far from reality and is obsessed with shapes, and yet not an abstract painter\". Chen also did not take to modern western art philosophies of that by western counterparts of his time like &lt;a href=\"Picasso\"&gt;Picasso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD\"&gt;Salvador Dal\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;.\nChen was also interested in human figures. He also did not see that humans are complex with distortions and conflicts, but merely a pattern of images, yet not like a pieced &lt;a href=\"jigsaw%20puzzle\"&gt;jigsaw puzzle&lt;/a&gt;. His interest was especially in local Indian people, particularly blue-collared workers and dairymen working in &lt;a href=\"Pen%20%28enclosure%29\"&gt;cattleyard&lt;/a&gt;; the geometric forms of Indian women dancers was an ideal subject of study for the artist.\nChen's mastery in depicting human figures was also found in keen observation of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; and animals. His subjects include &lt;a href=\"landscape\"&gt;landscape&lt;/a&gt;s, figures, birds and animals, &lt;a href=\"still%20life\"&gt;still life&lt;/a&gt; studies and &lt;a href=\"Abstract%20art\"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; compositions. Chen was especially adept at drawing &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monkey\"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;s. Among all the animal paintings by him, Chen's gibbon paintings stand out, as they were noted by Chen's attention to detail and sensitive rendering of the beautiful creatures. His first inspiration from painting gibbons came from a reproduction of a gibbon painting that formed the right triptych of the famous painting, \"White Robed Guanyin, Crane and Gibbon\" by the 13th-century &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Song%20dynasty\"&gt;Southern Song dynasty&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Muqi\"&gt;Muqi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAwed by its lifelike quality, he was convinced with Muqi's great skill in close observation of the gibbons. So day and night, Chen studied Muqi's print and emulated the painting. Chen had never seen a gibbon when he was in China, and as a result he did not realise that gibbons, unlike monkeys, lacked tails.\nIt was only much later in the late-1940s, that a foreigner pointed out his error in his painting, and corrected him. Around that time, he had bought a &lt;a href=\"Lar%20Gibbon\"&gt;white faced gibbon&lt;/a&gt; for $300 at a local pet shop shortly after he arrived in Singapore. This gave him immense opportunities to study the creature's postures and its characteristics, by rearing it in his home garden. In time, Chen had a total of six pet gibbons \u2013 one white, one grey and four black ones.\nHonours.\nFor his contributions to the fine arts in Singapore, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yusof%20Ishak\"&gt;Yusof Ishak&lt;/a&gt; conferred Chen the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Service%20Star\"&gt;Public Service Star&lt;/a&gt; in 1964.\nChen's artistic endeavours have also made history by being the first artist with a number of first honours conferred on him. In 1975, Chen was conferred an honorary degree of &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Letters\"&gt;Doctor of Letters&lt;/a&gt; by the then-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, and President of Singapore, &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Sheares\"&gt;Benjamin Sheares&lt;/a&gt;. In 1980, he became the first Singaporean artist to be invited, and conferred with the \"Golden Chapter\" gold medal award, by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20History\"&gt;National Museum of History&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan. He was also the first recipient of the &lt;a href=\"ASEAN\"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/a&gt; Cultural and Communications Award for outstanding artists, in 1987.\nAfter his death in 1991 at age 85, Chen was awarded a &lt;a href=\"Posthumous%20recognition\"&gt;posthumous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pingat%20Jasa%20Gemilang\"&gt;Meritorious Service Medal&lt;/a&gt;."
