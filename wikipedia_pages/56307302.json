She was part of the &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Young%20Things\"&gt;Bright Young Things&lt;/a&gt; immortalized by &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Waugh\"&gt;Evelyn Waugh&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Vile%20Bodies\"&gt;Vile Bodies&lt;/a&gt;\" (mostly inspired by the Plunket Greenes).\nBiography.\nElizabeth Frances Russell was born on 6 July 1899, the daughter of Harold John Hastings Russell and Lady Victoria Alberta Leveson-Gower. She was a granddaughter of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Russell\"&gt;Lord Arthur Russell&lt;/a&gt;, and second cousin once removed of &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20Russell\"&gt;Bertrand Russell&lt;/a&gt;. Her aunts were &lt;a href=\"Flora%20Russell\"&gt;Flora Russell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diana%20E.%20H.%20Russell\"&gt;Diana Russell&lt;/a&gt; and her great-grandmother was &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Russell%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Bedford\"&gt;Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford&lt;/a&gt;. Her family descended from &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary I of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile her fianc\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Plunket%20Greene\"&gt;Richard Plunket Greene&lt;/a&gt;, was a school teacher at &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Clinton\"&gt;Aston Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Russell went to visit him and met &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Waugh\"&gt;Evelyn Waugh&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she formed a friendship. Sometime she drove &lt;a href=\"Alastair%20Hugh%20Graham\"&gt;Alastair Hugh Graham&lt;/a&gt;, who was Waugh's special friend of the time. It was the night of the party that Waugh and &lt;a href=\"Olivia%20Plunket%20Greene\"&gt;Olivia Plunket Greene&lt;/a&gt;, Richard's sister and Waugh's love interest, had organised to celebrate Richard and Elizabeth's engagement, that Waugh and &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Ponsonby%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Ponsonby%20of%20Shulbrede\"&gt;Matthew Ponsonby, 2nd Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede&lt;/a&gt;, Richard's cousin, were arrested while driving the wrong side in the Strand.\nOn 21 December 1926 Evelyn Waugh was a best man to the marriage of Elizabeth Frances Russell and Richard Plunket Greene. &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Balfour%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Kinross\"&gt;Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross&lt;/a&gt; was a guest at the wedding. They had one son, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Plunket%20Greene\"&gt;Alexander Plunket Greene&lt;/a&gt; (1932\u20131990), who married fashion designer &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Quant\"&gt;Mary Quant&lt;/a&gt;.

According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Punch\"&gt;The Punch&lt;/a&gt;\": \"It is not easy to strike an original note, but the Plunket Greenes have overcome the difficulty so emphatically that they may almost be accused of thumping.\" In 1934 they wrote \"Eleven-Thirty Till Twelve\", a detective novel set in London Society.\nIn the 1930s, Elizabeth Russell was a fan of motor racing and won a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20motor%20racing\"&gt;grand prix&lt;/a&gt; race in Belgium.\nElizabeth Plunket Greene died on 18 December 1978."
