    "text": "Aitken Spence PLC (; ) is a &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Blue%20chip%20%28stock%20market%29\"&gt;blue chip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conglomerate%20%28company%29\"&gt;conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; with operations in &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the Pacific. Listed in the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Colombo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; since 1983, it has major interests in hotels, travel, maritime services and logistics. The group also has a significant presence in printing, plantations, power generation, financial services, IT, &lt;a href=\"Business%20process%20outsourcing\"&gt;Business Process Outsourcing&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Knowledge%20process%20outsourcing\"&gt;Knowledge Process Outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; sector, elevator agency services, garments, and property development.\nAitken Spence has been recognised by &lt;a href=\"Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; as one of the most successful publicly traded companies with annual sales under US$1 billion outside of the United States, for three consecutive years. In 2012, Aitken Spence was adjudged the top winner of the Best Corporate Citizen Award in 2017 and 2012 presented by the &lt;a href=\"Ceylon%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;Ceylon Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; and has retained the title for 11 consecutive years. The company is one of the first signatories to the UN's &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Global%20Compact\"&gt;Global Compact&lt;/a&gt; in Sri Lanka.\nHistory.\nWhilst the roots of Aitken Spence can be dated back to Wilson &amp; Archer Partnership of the 1830s in the early &lt;a href=\"British%20Ceylon\"&gt;British Colonial Ceylon&lt;/a&gt;, the company began to take its current form after the signing of a formal partnership agreement between Thomas Clark and Patrick Gordon Spence\u2014Scottish merchants and shipping agents in &lt;a href=\"Galle\"&gt;Galle&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on 1 September 1868, wherein Clark Spence &amp; Co. was established. Clark Spence &amp; Co.'s trading segment at this stage included exports of &lt;a href=\"graphite\"&gt;natural vein graphite&lt;/a&gt; (plumbago), gems, hides, &lt;a href=\"Caesalpinia%20sappan\"&gt;Sappan wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;, coffee, coconut oil, &lt;a href=\"coir\"&gt;coir yarn, bristle fibre&lt;/a&gt;, arrack, and &lt;a href=\"citronella%20oil\"&gt;citronella oil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Europe\"&gt;Continental Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;; and imports of &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burmese&lt;/a&gt; rice and coal for &lt;a href=\"Steamboat\"&gt;steamer ship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20oil%23Bunker%20fuel\"&gt;bunkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 5 April 1871, Patrick Gordon Spence, secured Clark Spence &amp; Co. as the sole agent of Lloyd's of London in &lt;a href=\"Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt;. In order to service the Agency for the &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s\"&gt;Lloyd's of London&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;Port of Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, Clark Spence &amp; Co. partnered with Britton, Aitken &amp; Co. to open a branch office in &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;. On New Year's Day, 1873, E.C. Britton opted out of the Britton, Aitken &amp; Co. partnership, resulting in Patrick Gordon Spence, Edward Aitken and S.R. Aitken coming together to form Aitken Spence &amp; Co. to manage the operations in Colombo, whilst Clark Spence &amp; Co. continued in partnership to operate in Galle. In 1876, Aitken Spence &amp; Co. obtained the Lloyds agency from Clark Spence &amp; Co. Aitken Spence had also obtained the local agency of &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Crucible\"&gt;Morgan Crucible Company&lt;/a&gt; for trading in plumbago. As &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt; became the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence &amp; Co became more prominent and subsequently its partner company, Clark Spence &amp; Co. originally based in &lt;a href=\"Galle\"&gt;Galle&lt;/a&gt;, became a subsidiary of Aitken Spence &amp; Co.\nBy the 1880s, Aitken Spence had also secured the shipping agencies and &lt;a href=\"Netherland%20Line\"&gt;Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland&lt;/a&gt; for Ceylon. The company moved into plantations sector as an agency house in the early 1900s and with the onset of the Great Depression, began to withdraw from its trading business. In 1918, Aitken Spence purchased the &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Building%2C%20Colombo\"&gt;Freudenberg Building&lt;/a&gt; in Colombo, and made it its company headquarters having renamed the building as Lloyds Building. As a pioneer in port operations, Aitken Spence was entrusted in coordinating the Operations of Colombo Port during the Second World War.\nAitken Spence became a Private Company in 1952. In its centenary year, 1968, it appointed its first Sri Lankan Chairman, E.L. Van Langenberg. By 1971, as Sri Lanka was preparing to end British dominion and declare as &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka%23Independence\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, the company became a wholly Sri Lankan owned entity. In 1972, it began to offer shares to its executives, thereby broad basing its ownership. The company eventually moved on from this model and in 1983 offered its shares to the general public on the &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Colombo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; with an issued share capital of Rs. 51 million.\nDuring the early 1960s and early 1970s, Insurance and Plantations sectors\u2014which were core business segments of Aitken Spence, where the company had been well established at the time\u2014were nationalized. However, the Group's &lt;a href=\"marine%20insurance\"&gt;marine insurance&lt;/a&gt; segment (including its Lloyd Agency) continued to operate as it did not fall within the purview of nationalization.\nDespite the setbacks from nationalization, in realizing the then government's thrust to boost tourism, Aitken Spence launched its tourism segment in 1972 with investments in its first hotel (Neptune Hotel in Beruwala, Sri Lanka opened in 1974). The company then entered into Aviation in 1974 (as general sales agent for &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Airlines\"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; in Sri Lanka). In consolidating its travel agency business that had begun with the launch of Aitken Spence Hotels in 1974, Aitken Spence set up Aitken Spence Travels in 1977 as inbound and outbound tour operators in Sri Lanka and as agents for &lt;a href=\"Eurail\"&gt;Eurail&lt;/a&gt; and Britrail. Tourism is now a core business segment of Aitken Spence.\nWith Sri Lanka adopting open market economic policies focused on export led growth in 1977, Aitken Spence forayed further into new business segments : Container and allied services in 1979; Garments and apparels in 1979; International courier service agency with &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Nationwide%20Transport\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; in 1981; and Elevators in 1989 as agent of &lt;a href=\"Otis%20Elevator%20Company\"&gt;OTIS&lt;/a&gt;. With insurance sector being deregulated in the 1980s, the Group played a pivotal role in the resurgence of private sector insurance as a proponent of the National Insurance Corporation and Union Assurance Ltd, stakes in which Aitken Spence subsequently divested. Aitken Spence reentered Plantations sector, when the sector was reprivatized in 1992, through its stake in Udapussellawa Plantation PLC that was later divested.\nIn response to the Power Crisis in Sri Lanka in 1996, Aitken Spence began to explore investment opportunities in power generation sector, with first two power plants coming online in 2002. The Group also maintained container vessel operations, with acquisition of five ships in a joint venture with Ceyline Group in 2003, which it later divested in 2008. In 2010, in continuing its partnership with Ceyline Group, Aitken Spence invested in &lt;a href=\"Colombo%20International%20Nautical%20and%20Engineering%20College\"&gt;CINEC&lt;/a&gt;, Sri Lanka's largest private higher education institution. In 2004, Aitken Spence Travels partnered with &lt;a href=\"TUI%20Group\"&gt;TUI Group&lt;/a&gt; of Germany to form a joint venture that is the largest leisure, travel and tourism company in the world.\nAitken Spence was the first Sri Lankan resort operator to embark on overseas resort operations having acquired Bathala Island Resort of &lt;a href=\"Maldives\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; in 1993. In 1996, Aitken Spence entered &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; through Aitken Spence Cargo with its shipping services. A decade later, in 2006, Aitken Spence entered the Indian hospitality sector, having secured management contracts for five hotel properties in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. On the same year, the company broke new ground by becoming the first Sri Lankan company to venture into port efficiency management outside of Sri Lanka, when it undertook to improve efficiency of ports in the African continent. The company increased its global presence even further by obtaining the management of four hotel properties in &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. In 2013, Aitken Spence announced its proposed venture into &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; to manage the Ports of &lt;a href=\"Suva\"&gt;Suva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lautoka\"&gt;Lautoka&lt;/a&gt; in a public private partnership with the Government of Fiji.

However, due to the longevity of the process in obtaining clearances, the Japanese partner backed out and in 1999, Aitken Spence (51%) partnered with &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Development%20Corporation\"&gt;Commonwealth Development Corporation&lt;/a&gt; Globeleq (29%), Baneras House of India (10%) and &lt;a href=\"Wartsila\"&gt;Wartsila Finland Oy&lt;/a&gt; (10%) to construct the &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Matara%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Ace Matara Power Station&lt;/a&gt; (24.4MW) and &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Horana%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Ace Horana Power Station&lt;/a&gt; (24.4MW). Subsequently, following a Request for Proposal by &lt;a href=\"Ceylon%20Electricity%20Board\"&gt;Ceylon Electricity Board&lt;/a&gt; (CEB) in February 2002, Aitken Spence together with &lt;a href=\"Caterpillar%20Inc.\"&gt;Caterpillar Power Ventures Corporation&lt;/a&gt; began the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Embilipitiya%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Embilipitiya Power Station&lt;/a&gt; (100MW), which came online in April 2005.\nAce Power Embilipitiya thermal power plant operates on a 100MW while the Branford Hydro power plant operates at 2.5MW, Ace Wind power plant at 3MW and Western Power at 10MW capacity. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the &lt;a href=\"Ceylon%20Electricity%20Board\"&gt;Ceylon Electricity Board&lt;/a&gt; and Ace Power Embilipitiya lapsed in 2015; however, renewed the agreement for a one more year in April, 2016, when the country ran into power crisis after two back-to-back blackouts in late 2015 and early 2016. During the first quarter of 2018, the government decided to extend the purchasing of the thermal power for three more years as the country had four seasons of back-to-back dry spells, which exhausted reservoirs and the crucial catchment areas.\nHydro, Wind, Solar, Waste-to-Energy and Dendro Power.\nAitken Spence has also sought to diversify its power portfolio with increased presence in the clean and renewable energy domain in Sri Lanka.\nAitken Spence Power has already completed construction of the 2.5 MW Branford Hydro Power Plant in Matale, and of &lt;a href=\"Ambewela%20Aitken%20Spence%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Ace Wind Power&lt;/a&gt; power plant in &lt;a href=\"Ambewela\"&gt;Ambewela&lt;/a&gt; that has an installed capacity of 3 MW. Both power plants were connected to the national grid during 2012/13 financial year. Aitken Spence Power is also currently building the &lt;a href=\"Aitken%20Spence%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Aitken Spence Power Station&lt;/a&gt;, Waste-To-Energy Coprocessing Plant at Muthurajawela.\nAce Power embarked on a landmark project in the country's waste to energy sphere. Seen as a vital and much needed solution for the waste disposal crisis within Colombo city limits, the proposed project involves the construction of a 10MW waste-toenergy plant at Muthurajawela. The plant will be fuelled by waste collected from the Colombo Municipal Area, which was previously dumped in Meethotamulla. The plant is equipped to convert between 600 \u2013 800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste daily to electricity. Estimated to cost Rs. 13 billion on completion, the project is funded through a combination of equity and term loan funding. The construction work on the project commenced following the ground-breaking ceremony held in August 2017 with the participation of the president. This new waste to energy project is due to commence commercial operations in 2019.\nAitken Spence Hotels (through biomass plants and solar generation) and Plantations (through mini hydro projects) have also undertaken mini power projects of their own. Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara is the first hotel in Sri Lanka to enter into a net metering agreement with CEB.\nPlantation services.\nAitken Spence has been in the plantations industry from the early 1900s. In 1975, the estates originally owned by Aitken Spence were acquired under the plantation nationalization program. In 1992, with the re-privatization of plantations industry, Aitken Spence reentered the sector in taking over the management of Udapussellawa Plantation PLC. It also invested in a minority stake in Talawakelle Plantations. Aitken Spence later divested its stake in Udapussellawa and Talawakelle Plantations\nThe management of Elpitiya Plantations PLC was taken over by Aitken Spence in 1997 from Carsons through Aitken Spence Plantations Managements Ltd. The Group currently manages 13 estates (with over 8800 hectares of cultivated land) in Sri Lanka, producing high, mid and low grown teas. From the 13 estates, six estates are located on the up cluster in &lt;a href=\"Kandy\"&gt;Kandy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nuwara%20Eliya\"&gt;Nuwara Eliya&lt;/a&gt; districts (estates: Dunsinane, Sheen, Fernlands, Meddecombra, New Peacock and Nayapane) and seven estates in the low cluster (Deviturai, Talgaswella, Gulugahakanda, Lelwala, Ketandola, Bentota and Elpitiya).

Printing services were gradually opened for external parties and with the higher demand, the service offering was expanded with a full-fledged &lt;a href=\"printing%20plant\"&gt;printing plant&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, in 1962, printing plant was moved from Galle to Colombo (Vauxhall St. Colombo 02 premises, where current Aitken Spence Group Headquarters is located) and ownership transferred to Aitken Spence &amp; Co.\nIn 1977, whole printing department was burnt from a fire and its operations were halted. In 1982, a new printing plant was built at Bloemendhal Road, Colombo 13 to resume printing services. In 2010, due to capacity constraints, the company made a decision to relocate this printing plant yet again.\nThe production of printed packaging materials represents about 80 percent of business for the printing segment. In regards to packaging materials, it currently caters to major brands in &lt;a href=\"garment\"&gt;garment&lt;/a&gt; industry, &lt;a href=\"Fast-moving%20consumer%20goods\"&gt;FMCG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pharmaceuticals\"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; in Sri Lanka.
