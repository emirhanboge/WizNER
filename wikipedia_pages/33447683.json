    "text": "Martin Henry \"Harry\" Foran (c. 1850 \u2013 25 April 1908) was an Australian schoolteacher and journalist.\nForan was born near &lt;a href=\"Kilkee\"&gt;Kilkee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Clare\"&gt;County Clare&lt;/a&gt; to James Forhen, head of a fishing family. After considering the priesthood Foran became a student teacher in 1871, but legal trouble associated with his involvement in tenant reform and the campaign for &lt;a href=\"Home%20Rule\"&gt;Home Rule&lt;/a&gt; led him to migrate to &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in 1876. He returned to teaching, and again became known as a troublemaker; his licence was withheld until 1885 in an attempt to be rid of him. He was suspended on charges of disciplinary and sexual misconduct in 1888; although he was cleared, the case was reopened in April 1889 and he was dismissed, losing a subsequent appeal to the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. The case attracted significant media attention and Foran became something of a celebrity.\nRelocating to &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in 1893, Foran worked as a journalist and a regular speaker in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Domain%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Domain&lt;/a&gt;. Appealing mainly to the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; working class, he became associated with the radical wing of the &lt;a href=\"Protectionist%20Party\"&gt;Protectionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, opposing the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Labour Leagues&lt;/a&gt; on the grounds of \"atheistic socialism, opportunism and Protestant bigotry\". He edited \"Sydney Irish World\" from 1894 to 1895 and ran for the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Parliament\"&gt;New South Wales Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in 1894, 1895, 1898 and 1901 as an &lt;a href=\"independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;, without success; he came second to Premier &lt;a href=\"George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;George Reid&lt;/a&gt; running for the &lt;a href=\"1901%20Australian%20federal%20election\"&gt;first federal election&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20East%20Sydney\"&gt;East Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. During this time he earned the nicknames the \"Domain &lt;a href=\"Demosthenes\"&gt;Demosthenes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"the Mayor of &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1902, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and continued his activities on Yarra Bank, running for &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Melbourne%20Ports\"&gt;Melbourne Ports&lt;/a&gt; in 1903. Despite his early opposition he joined the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1904; he contributed occasionally to the Catholic weekly the \"Tribune\" and was clearly associated with the Labor Party's Catholic wing. His health, however, began to fail and he died almost penniless at &lt;a href=\"St%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;St Vincent's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"jaundice\"&gt;jaundice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hydatids\"&gt;hydatids&lt;/a&gt;. He was remembered variously as a \"political failure\", a \"knight of the Southern Cross\" and \"probably the most fluent public speaker in Australia\"."
