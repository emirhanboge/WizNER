    "text": "Jean Bart was a &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; of the built for the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1880s and early 1890s. The second member of the &lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; of three ships, \"Jean Bart\" and her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s were ordered during the tenure of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9ophile%20Aube\"&gt;Th\u00e9ophile Aube&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"French%20Minister%20of%20Marine\"&gt;Minister of Marine&lt;/a&gt; according to the theories of the doctrine. The ships were intended as long-range &lt;a href=\"commerce%20raider\"&gt;commerce raider&lt;/a&gt;s, and they were armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four guns, were protected by an armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, and were capable of steaming at a top speed of .\n\"Jean Bart\" served with the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Squadron%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt; for the first two years of her career, thereafter being transferred to the Northern Squadron. During this period, she took part in training exercises with the fleet. In 1897, the ship was modernized with new masts and electric &lt;a href=\"search%20light\"&gt;search light&lt;/a&gt;s. She was deployed to &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; in Southeast Asia in 1898 and she was part of the French squadron that responded to the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Uprising\"&gt;Boxer Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Qing%20China\"&gt;Qing China&lt;/a&gt;. \"Jean Bart\" underwent a second refit between 1903 and 1906 that included new &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s that improved her performance. She saw little use afterward, as she &lt;a href=\"ran%20aground\"&gt;ran aground&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sahara\"&gt;Western Sahara&lt;/a&gt; in early 1907 and could not be refloated.\nDesign.\nAdmiral &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9ophile%20Aube\"&gt;Th\u00e9ophile Aube&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Minister%20of%20Marine\"&gt;French Minister of Marine&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1880s, was an ardent supporter of the doctrine that emphasized long-range &lt;a href=\"commerce%20raiding\"&gt;commerce raiding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon becoming the naval minister in 1886, Aube called for the construction of six large and ten small &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, though by the end of his tenure in 1887, the program had been reduced to five large, two medium, and six small cruisers. Aube ordered the first two \"Alger\"-&lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; cruisers to fulfill the requirements for the first set of large cruisers, and his successor, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Barbey\"&gt;\u00c9douard Barbey&lt;/a&gt;, authorized the third. The three \"Alger\"s proved to be the last of the initial series of commerce raiders built under the influence of the .\n\"Jean Bart\" was &lt;a href=\"long%20between%20perpendiculars\"&gt;long between perpendiculars&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; . Her crew varied over the course of her career, amounting to 387\u2013405\u00a0officers and enlisted men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of &lt;a href=\"triple-expansion%20steam%20engine\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s driving two &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. Steam was provided by eight coal-burning &lt;a href=\"fire-tube%20boiler\"&gt;fire-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s that were ducted into two &lt;a href=\"funnel%20%28ship%29\"&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt;. Her machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at .\nThe ship was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of four 28-&lt;a href=\"caliber%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;caliber&lt;/a&gt; guns and six 30-cal. guns. All of these guns were placed in individual &lt;a href=\"pivot%20mount\"&gt;pivot mount&lt;/a&gt;s; the 164\u00a0mm guns were in &lt;a href=\"sponson\"&gt;sponson&lt;/a&gt;s located fore and aft, with two guns per &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;. Four of the 138\u00a0mm guns were in sponsons between the 164\u00a0mm guns, one was in an &lt;a href=\"embrasure\"&gt;embrasure&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt; and the last was in a swivel mount on the stern. For close-range defense against &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, she carried a pair of &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%2065%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201891\"&gt;9-pounder guns&lt;/a&gt;, eight &lt;a href=\"QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;3-pounder Hotchkiss guns&lt;/a&gt;, and eight &lt;a href=\"Hotchkiss%20revolver%20cannon\"&gt;Hotchkiss revolver cannon&lt;/a&gt;. She was also armed with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in her &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;. Armor protection consisted of a curved armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, along with plating on the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nService history.\nWork on \"Jean Bart\" began with her &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;keel laying&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20de%20Rochefort\"&gt;Arsenal de Rochefort&lt;/a&gt; shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime\"&gt;Rochefort&lt;/a&gt; in September 1887. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in November 1889 and was completed in 1891. By 1893, \"Jean Bart\" had been assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Squadron%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, the main French battle fleet. At that time, the unit also included several modern &lt;a href=\"ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclad warship&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"armored%20cruiser\"&gt;armored cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , and the protected cruisers , , , and . The following year, she continued to operate with the squadron. She took part in annual training exercises that year to evaluate the effectiveness of the French coastal defense system. The squadron went to sea on 15 July and began the operations the next day, which lasted until 29 July; during operations on the 18th, \"Jean Bart\" collided with the torpedo boat . She was not damaged, but \"Grondeur\" suffered damage to her bow and had to return to port for repairs. The maneuvers demonstrated the usefulness of torpedo boat flotillas in coastal defense, but highlighted that France's coastal defense system in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; was not yet complete.\nIn 1895, she was transferred to the Northern Squadron, which was kept in &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt; for only four months per year. The unit at that time consisted of the &lt;a href=\"coastal%20defense%20ship\"&gt;coastal defense ship&lt;/a&gt; , the ironclads , , and , the armored cruiser , and the protected cruisers and . By 1896, she was reduced to the 2nd category of reserve, along with several old coastal defense ships, ironclads, and other cruisers. They were retained in a state that allowed them to be &lt;a href=\"mobilization\"&gt;mobilized&lt;/a&gt; in the event of a major war. While out of service in 1897, the ship was refitted, which included replacing her military masts with lighter pole masts; the French reasoned that the smaller masts would make her less visible at a distance. The light guns that had been carried in the military masts' tops were relocated to her upper deck and superstructure. Electric &lt;a href=\"search%20light\"&gt;search light&lt;/a&gt;s were installed on the pole masts.\nWith the beginning of the unrest that led to the &lt;a href=\"Boxer%20Uprising\"&gt;Boxer Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Qing%20China\"&gt;Qing China&lt;/a&gt; in 1898, many European colonial powers began to reinforce their naval forces in East Asia. \"Jean Bart\" was mobilized that year and sent to the region, and at that time, the French squadron in the Far East consisted of the old ironclad , the protected cruisers and , and the &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; . \"Jean Bart\" remained on station in East Asia through early 1901; at that time, eight other cruisers were assigned to the station. By May, \"Jean Bart\" had been recalled to France, where she was reduced to &lt;a href=\"reserve%20fleet\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ship was modernized in 1903, the most significant improvement being the replacement of her original boilers with &lt;a href=\"Niclausse%20boiler\"&gt;Niclausse-type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s, which increased her performance to from . The work was completed by 1906, and she conducted &lt;a href=\"sea%20trials\"&gt;sea trials&lt;/a&gt; in October. On 11 February 1907, \"Jean Bart\" was wrecked off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sahara\"&gt;Western Sahara&lt;/a&gt;, near Cape Barbas. This was the first in a series of disasters for the French Navy that year, which also included the wrecking of the armored cruiser off the coast of China and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"pre-dreadnought%20battleship\"&gt;pre-dreadnought battleship&lt;/a&gt; by an accidental magazine fire. The captains of both cruisers were both brought before &lt;a href=\"courts-martial\"&gt;courts-martial&lt;/a&gt;, both convicted of negligent ship handling, and both barred from further commands for three years."
