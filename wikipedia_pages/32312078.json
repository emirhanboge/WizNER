    "text": "Andreas Samuel Krebs (10 March 1766 \u2013 28 March 1818) was a &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Danish-Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; army officer.\nEarly years.\nBorn on 10 March 1766 at &lt;a href=\"T%C3%B8nder\"&gt;T\u00f8nder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B8nderjylland\"&gt;S\u00f8nderjylland&lt;/a&gt;, Krebs was the son of vicar Peter Ditlev Krebs and Birgitte Marie Lutz. Originally, he was to follow in his father's footsteps and study &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, but when he showed good understanding within &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, he got a desire for a career within the military.\nIn order to study and prepare for his officer exam, Krebs was sent to his uncle, Professor John Heinrich Krebs. After he passed his exam, he was accepted as a cadet in 1779 and later joined the &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29\"&gt;J\u00e4ger Corps&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Holstein\"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20War\"&gt;Theater War&lt;/a&gt; in 1788, Krebs was sent to Norway and took part in the advance against &lt;a href=\"Bohusl%C3%A4n\"&gt;Bohusl\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt; and the victory over the Swedes at Kvistrum bridge. After the war was over Krebs joined the Norwegian j\u00e4ger corps, and married Else Thyrholm Gude on 12 February 1798. In 1806 he was also promoted to &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary career.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Dano-Swedish%20War%20of%201808-1809\"&gt;war once again broke out&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Denmark\u2013Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; from 1808 to 1809, Krebs was put in direct command over the j\u00e4ger corps. During the war, he distinguished himself during skirmishes at &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B8land\"&gt;H\u00f8land&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B8denes\"&gt;R\u00f8denes&lt;/a&gt; and Berby, and was for his efforts awarded with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Dannebrog\"&gt;Order of the Dannebrog&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Krebs was appointed interim commander at &lt;a href=\"Kongsvinger%20Fortress\"&gt;Kongsvinger Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, while he became regimental commander of the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Akershus\"&gt;Akershus&lt;/a&gt; sharpshooter regiment, where he advanced to the rank of &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Swedish-Norwegian%20War%20%281814%29\"&gt;Swedish campaign against Norway&lt;/a&gt; in 1814, Krebs was appointed head of a division in the district around Kongsvinger. Here he successfully led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Lier%20entrenchment\"&gt;Lier entrenchment&lt;/a&gt;, and the counter-attack that drove the Swedes back across the border at &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Matrand\"&gt;Matrand&lt;/a&gt;. The Norwegian victories at Lier and Matrand strengthened the morale among the Norwegian population and King &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Frederik\"&gt;Christian Frederik&lt;/a&gt; was sure that the fortunes of war had turned in favor of Norwegians. Although the war ended with a Swedish victory after the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Moss\"&gt;Convention of Moss&lt;/a&gt;, Krebs was hailed as the \"hero from Lier and Matrand\", and was considered to have saved Norway's pride in an otherwise despondently campaign. After the union between Norway and Sweden was signed, Krebs was promoted to &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; and became adjutant to &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XIII%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Charles XIII&lt;/a&gt; in 1816. In 1818 Krebs was appointed commander of the 1st &lt;a href=\"Akershus\"&gt;Akershus&lt;/a&gt; Brigade, but died the same year.\nLegacy.\nKrebs' street () in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; was named after him in 1874, the same time as he has streets named after him in &lt;a href=\"Kongsvinger\"&gt;Kongsvinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skotterud\"&gt;Skotterud&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1879 a memorial to Andreas Samuel Krebs was unveiled at Christ Cemetery in Oslo. On every 17 May (&lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Constitution%20Day\"&gt;Norwegian Constitution Day&lt;/a&gt;) a garland is laid on the memorial by &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Majestet%20Kongens%20Garde\"&gt;Hans Majestet Kongens Garde&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the few 17 May events in the capital that has directly to do with the events that took place in 1814."
