    "text": "The Golden House of Samarkand is a &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novel\"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt;, episode of &lt;a href=\"Corto%20Maltese\"&gt;Corto Maltese&lt;/a&gt;'s adventures, a &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Maltese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt;. He lives a long journey from the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the heart of Asia, between December 1921 and September 1922. This story was written and drawn by the Italian &lt;a href=\"comic%20book%20creator\"&gt;comic book creator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Pratt\"&gt;Hugo Pratt&lt;/a&gt;. This is the twenty sixth story and eighth album in the series. It was published for the first time between &lt;a href=\"1967%20in%20comics\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1969%20in%20comics\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;, in the magazine Sergente Kirk.\nSynopsis.\nRhodes.\nSitting at the foot of a column, Corto still has his head full of images from his previous &lt;a href=\"treasure%20hunting\"&gt;treasure hunting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, dreaming of &lt;a href=\"St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;St Mark's Basilica&lt;/a&gt;. But in this month of December 1921, a new hunt opened up to him. Indeed, he is now in &lt;a href=\"Rhodes%20%28city%29\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; (island of &lt;a href=\"Rhodes\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;), near a column with a deer, to solve another riddle of his friend &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Rolfe\"&gt;Baron Corvo&lt;/a&gt;. It speaks of the poet &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Byron\"&gt;Lord Byron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"memoir\"&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt;, hidden by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20John%20Trelawny\"&gt;Edward John Trelawny&lt;/a&gt; on the Kawakly mosque, under the moon. Thus, the sailor discreetly climbs the &lt;a href=\"dome\"&gt;dome&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt; and removes the &lt;a href=\"crescent\"&gt;crescent&lt;/a&gt; moon adorning the top. In a hidey-hole, among the &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, he finds the precious documents. It notably include a letter from Trelawny. He speaks of a legendary treasure hidden by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the Afghan mountains, as shown on an attached map.\nBut Corto is quickly overtaken by reality when Italian troops spot his night walk. As he tries to escape them, he is called by a mysterious man who leads him to a secret meeting. The sailor is confused by the participants with a man named Timur Chevket, a leader of a &lt;a href=\"Turanism\"&gt;Turanist&lt;/a&gt; movement, who is as alike as two peas in a pod. To preserve his life, hi decides to pull the wool over their eyes. Commander Bahiar recounts recent events: General &lt;a href=\"Enver%20Pasha\"&gt;Enver Pasha&lt;/a&gt;, ousted by &lt;a href=\"Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt; (now president of &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;), wants to regain his place. To reach this goal, he broke with the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Anti-communism\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. His aim is to creating a great state unifying the Turkish peoples, from Turkey to western China. Bahiar gives an appointment to Chevket/Corto in &lt;a href=\"Adana\"&gt;Adana&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Cilicia\"&gt;Cilicia&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey) and, together, they will go to &lt;a href=\"Turkestan\"&gt;Turkestan&lt;/a&gt;. The sailor is forced to agree and, after the meeting, shows a clean pair of heels. But he is notwithstanding caught by the Italian troops, who lead him to the &lt;a href=\"Carabinieri\"&gt;Carabinieri&lt;/a&gt; captain, Antonio Sorrentino. Corto has already met him in Venice in the story \"The Angel in the Window to the Orient\" (in the volume \"&lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Tales%20%28Corto%20Maltese%29\"&gt;Celtic Tales&lt;/a&gt;\").\nFinally, he goes to the house of his Greek friend Cassandra, who lodges him. She uses her skills in &lt;a href=\"tasseography\"&gt;tasseography&lt;/a&gt; to guess his future in &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20coffee\"&gt;Greek Coffee&lt;/a&gt; grounds:he will experience dangerous and sad events. In his room, while carefully studying the documents, he receives his Turkish friend Ibahiyah. This one gives him information about Chevket and a &lt;a href=\"Saladin\"&gt;Saladin&lt;/a&gt;'s insignia to be accepted by the &lt;a href=\"Dervish\"&gt;Dervish&lt;/a&gt;es of Adana.\nTurkey.\nTwo days later, Cassandra's brother Narcissus leads Corto across the &lt;a href=\"Levantine%20Sea\"&gt;Levantine Sea&lt;/a&gt; (the easternmost part of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;) aboard his sailboat. After having suffered a &lt;a href=\"Etesian\"&gt;meltem&lt;/a&gt;, they berth in disaster on the Turkish coasts, near &lt;a href=\"Tarsus%2C%20Mersin\"&gt;Tarsus&lt;/a&gt;. Inland, they surprise two Europeans actors attacked by &lt;a href=\"Kurds\"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt; deserters. Once they get rid of these, the Maltese interacts with the artists. The man, a British disguised as &lt;a href=\"John%20Bull\"&gt;John Bull&lt;/a&gt;, will die quickly of a &lt;a href=\"Syncope%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;syncope&lt;/a&gt; caused by these distressing events. The woman, dressed as &lt;a href=\"Marianne\"&gt;Marianne&lt;/a&gt;, immediately fall for Corto. But suddenly, the Kurds come back and threaten them. Finally, Corto gets away with promising their leader Reshid a part of the treasure he is looking for and arranges to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Van%2C%20Turkey\"&gt;Van&lt;/a&gt; (Turkey).\nAt this era, the country has suffered the consequences of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost dead, was dismembered by the 1920 &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres\"&gt;Treaty of S\u00e8vres&lt;/a&gt;. The region where Corto is located, although part of Turkish territory, is under the domination of French troops. This explains why he met French soldiers there. Also, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk notably relied on helping the Kurds in his political ambitions. In return, he promised them an independent state. But, after the creation of Turkey, he denied them. The State of Kurdistan does not appear in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Lausanne\"&gt;Treaty of Lausanne&lt;/a&gt; of 1923, negotiated by it with European powers to replace that of S\u00e8vres.\nCorto therefore arrives in Adana in January 1922. There he is introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Mevlevi%20Order\"&gt;Mevlevi Order&lt;/a&gt; school, whose members are executing a danse: they are the famous '&lt;a href=\"Sufi%20whirling\"&gt;whirling dervishes&lt;/a&gt;'. Later, the Maltese discusses with their &lt;a href=\"Imam\"&gt;Imam&lt;/a&gt;, who hosts him. He explains that he wants to free his friend, the Russian sailor Rasputin, from the \"Golden House of Samarkand\". It's a horrible prison, which is located somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;. It is watched by fierce guards who relentlessly torture and kill their prisoners. The &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"brazier\"&gt;brazier&lt;/a&gt;s then remove the remains of the victims. This place is so called because it is only possible to escape through the golden dreams caused by the swirls of &lt;a href=\"hashish\"&gt;hashish&lt;/a&gt;. But during this time, Armenians nationalists spy on them: confusing Corto with Chevket, they attack the place to avenge the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt;, caused by the Turks. The Imam is dead, but the sailor survives.\nWhile walking through the streets of this city, he meets a girl who recites a &lt;a href=\"quatrain\"&gt;quatrain&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Khayyam\"&gt;Omar Khayyam&lt;/a&gt; (Persian poet of the 11th - 12th century). So, he gives her a &lt;a href=\"pomegranate\"&gt;pomegranate&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing this act of generosity, a mysterious veiled woman laughs at him and tries to scare him by hurting him. He recognizes in her an old acquaintance ... Later, he sees Marianne again, who leads him to a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20play\"&gt;shadow play&lt;/a&gt;, where a show \"&lt;a href=\"Karag%C3%B6z%20and%20Hacivat\"&gt;Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat&lt;/a&gt;\" is represented. During the play, Corto sees a puppet resembling Rasputin, which calls him. So he goes backstage and meets the woman, who is also looking for the treasure. All at once, he's knocked out and stripped. A dream follows where he finds himself in &lt;a href=\"Paradise\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and where Rasputin drives him ... to Pandora, an old love (in the center of the story \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20the%20Salty%20Sea\"&gt;The Ballad of the Salty Sea&lt;/a&gt;\").\nHe wakes up in a truck roading to Van, surrounded by Kurdish soldiers, in a convoy led by Bahiar. He arrives in this town bordering the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Van\"&gt;Lake Van&lt;/a&gt; in March. There he meets an old imam, Zorah, who agrees to help him cross &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;. But he wants to give him an eleven-year-old Armenian who survived the massacre of her parents. He asked him to take her to his family in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Armenia\"&gt;Russian Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, before recommending that he trust K\u0131smet (&lt;a href=\"destiny\"&gt;destiny&lt;/a&gt;). Then, he shows him his co-religionists who are followers of &lt;a href=\"Yazidism\"&gt;Yazidism&lt;/a&gt;. The youngest of the priests invokes the circle and the young peacock (&lt;a href=\"Melek%20Taus\"&gt;Melek Taus&lt;/a&gt;, head of the seven &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s in charge for watching over the world). Then, he calls &lt;a href=\"Shaitan\"&gt;Shaitan&lt;/a&gt;, whom Corto has already met in &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; under the name of &lt;a href=\"Samael\"&gt;Samael&lt;/a&gt; (in the story \"More Romeos, More Juliets\", published in the volume \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ethiopian%20%28Corto%20Maltese%29\"&gt;The Ethiopian&lt;/a&gt;\"). This character predicts the future of Corto, speaking of a tree with strange fruits.\nNext, Corto must meet Reshid near the &lt;a href=\"Semiramis\"&gt;Semiramis&lt;/a&gt; wall. But Zorah shows him that he was &lt;a href=\"Hanging\"&gt;hanged&lt;/a&gt; in a tree with his accomplices: these are the strange fruits mentioned by Shaitan. Later, a car awaits the Maltese, with Marianne and the mysterious woman inside. The latter is none other than Venexiana Stevenson, an old Corto's enemy. She tells him that Bahiar and the other Turkish nationalists now know his true identity (thanks to the &lt;a href=\"identity%20document\"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; found on him) and, moreover, she revealed to them his quest for the treasure. As for the little Armenian, she is taken hostage by the commander, in exchange for the treasure. The later executes Zorah. Corto, who does not know it, leaves with the two women.\nPersia.\nHe recommends that the driver cross the border with &lt;a href=\"Persia\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;, which would be the safest for them. This man, an adept of &lt;a href=\"Isma%27ilism\"&gt;Isma'ilism&lt;/a&gt; (a branch of &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shia Islam&lt;/a&gt;), leads them to the area of the &lt;a href=\"Alamut%20Castle\"&gt;Alamut Castle&lt;/a&gt;. The sailor takes the opportunity to tell the legend linked to this place, that of the Hashshashin. These &lt;a href=\"Saracen\"&gt;Saracen&lt;/a&gt;s once formed a &lt;a href=\"sect\"&gt;sect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nizari%20Isma%27ilism\"&gt;Nizari Isma'ilism&lt;/a&gt; current, having their lair in this castle. Under the influence of hashish, they massacred those whom their leader (the \"Old Man of the Mountain\") asked them to kill. Their name, translated into &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Assassins\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, is the origin of the term \"&lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;\". The Maltese continues his account, claiming that the existence of this terrible sect is confirmed by the testimonies of various people. They are for example Gerhardus, \"&lt;a href=\"Vidame\"&gt;vice dominus&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt; in 1170, as well as &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;Arnold of L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt;. But this legend is best known thanks to &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Polo\"&gt;Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt;, who mentions it in 1273 in his \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Travels%20of%20Marco%20Polo\"&gt;Book of the Marvels of the World&lt;/a&gt;\". The castle has since been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongols&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut Corto discovers that this order has not disappeared: the pilot is indeed a member. Thus, the latter leads them to the other Hashshashins, to go to the cult's new lair, \"New Alamut\". Approaching it, members believe it is occupied, possibly by a &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Cossack%20Brigade\"&gt;Persian Cossack Brigade&lt;/a&gt; ruled by &lt;a href=\"Reza%20Shah\"&gt;Reza Shah&lt;/a&gt;, and get scared. Corto goes on reconnaissance with a member named Abbas: there is no one there. Despite this, the Hashshashins have already fled. Thus, the three travelers remain on site to sleep. Corto explains his plans for the rest of his trip. He wants to cross the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; in order to free his friend. Next, he plans to search for the treasure in the legendary &lt;a href=\"Kafiristan\"&gt;Kafiristan&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Nuristan%20Province\"&gt;Nuristan Province&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;). Hearing this, Venexiana recalls \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Would%20Be%20King\"&gt;The Man Who Would Be King&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Rudyard%20Kipling\"&gt;Rudyard Kipling&lt;/a&gt;'s famous &lt;a href=\"1888%20in%20literature\"&gt;1888&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"novella\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt; which takes place in this region.\nDuring this time in Turkestan, in the lair of Enver Pasha, Rasputin is introduced to Chevket. The Russian confuses him with Corto, but the leader brutally disabuses him. Thus, Chevket is intrigued by this mysterious man who looks so much like him and whom he hears a lot about. Rasputin explains Corto's character to him, his sense of friendship: he is so noble that he borders on stupidity. This explains why he is able to brave a thousand dangers to save his friend. Afterwards, Chevket offers Rasputin to accept a military post in exchange for his freedom, having all the required qualities. This is why he changes sides to preserve his life, becoming an army instructor at the rank of &lt;a href=\"Qaid\"&gt;Qaid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"New Alamut\", suddenly, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; attacks the fortress. Soldiers escort then until a Soviet customs office. As they are threatened with being shot, Corto asks to call an old friend by phone to ask him to save them. He is none other than Joseph Djougachvili, recently appointed&lt;a href=\"General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, since April 1922. A few years later he will become the dictator of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, under the name of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, all three are released by the commissioner and can continue their adventures. The latter suggests that they embark in &lt;a href=\"Baku\"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt; (in current &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;) for Krasnovodsk (current &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BCrkmenba%C5%9Fy%2C%20Turkmenistan\"&gt;T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;), across the Caspian Sea.\nCentral Asia.\nMeanwhile, the Qaid Rasputin is introduced to his men by Chevket. He also gave him the Armenian hostage. But the girl is impertinent towards this new soldier. Angry, Rasputin wants to punish her and corners her near a chasm. Having no choice, she throws a stone at him, which makes him fall into the ravine. Ten days later, his head wrapped in a bandage, Rasputin comes out of his coma. Marianne is at his bedside. Corto is also there: he teaches him new events. The traitor Chevket has left with the young prisoner, whom he wants to use her for bartering for the treasure. He will wait for Corto near the &lt;a href=\"Kofarnihon\"&gt;Kofarnihon&lt;/a&gt; river.\nWithout warning, Armenian soldiers attack the fortress, as snow is falling on the &lt;a href=\"Darvoz%20Range\"&gt;Darvoz Range&lt;/a&gt;. Trapped, Enver Pasha then attempts a desperate exit to attack them. Delighted to kill their persecutor, they strafe him. This August 4, 1922, he finally succumbs to their bullets. Meanwhile, Rasputin and Corto are attached to cannons by the Pasha's soldiers in order to be killed. But they are saved by Venexiana. Later, when all the soldiers are gone, friends Corto and Rasputin dance together to celebrate their saved lives. Then, she confesses that she is pregnant and that she cannot continue the journey. So, she returns to Europe, accompanied by Marianne, happy to be useful to someone.\nHindu Kush.\nTherefore, the two sailors go to the appointment. They trudge through snowstorms with their mules. Arrived on September 5, 1922, they discreetly spy Chevket and his men. Corto is afraid of meet his double, something he considers a sign of misfortune. So Rasputin himself removes the problem with his weapon and frees the girl. Then they poach Chevket's men to help them find the treasure hiding place. Corto explains that it is somewhere in an area where various geopolitical interests collide. This is &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Game\"&gt;the Great Game&lt;/a&gt; that Rudyard Kipling talks about in his novel &lt;a href=\"Kim%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he tells them the legend about this treasure. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20the%20Great\"&gt;Cyrus II the Great&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Empire\"&gt;Persian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, presented an enormous treasure to &lt;a href=\"Tomyris\"&gt;Tomyris&lt;/a&gt;, queen of the &lt;a href=\"Amazons\"&gt;Amazons&lt;/a&gt;, whom he wanted to marry. But she preferred to cut off his head, to then keep his treasure. Centuries later, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29\"&gt;Macedon&lt;/a&gt;, defeated the great king of Persia &lt;a href=\"Darius%20III\"&gt;Darius III&lt;/a&gt;. He then had the treasure delivered to him, which he melted and molded in the form of a large golden ball symbolizing the sun. He then asked to hide it in the hollow of a mountain, in &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20Kush\"&gt;Hindu Kush&lt;/a&gt;. According to the precious documents, the treasure is found more precisely between Kafiristan and &lt;a href=\"Badakhshan%20Province\"&gt;Badakhshan&lt;/a&gt;, in Afghanistan.\nAfter researching, they find the entrance to a cave, guarded by a statue of &lt;a href=\"Ahriman\"&gt;Ahriman&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic spirit of &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrianism\"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, animated by his greed, Rasputin prevents Chevket's men from following them. So, he only continues with Corto and the girl inside the cave. All of a sudden, an earthquake collapses stones that block the entrance. Further on, lighting a match, they discover a fabulous and enormous golden ball. But the wind extinguishes the match. And when they light another one ... the treasure is gone! Mad with rage, Rasputin accuses the Armenian of having seized the treasure. But she says she hasn't seen him. What happened? A trick played by teasers demons? A collective hallucination? Or did the treasure just disappear during the earthquake?\nOut of spite, they exit by another path and fall ... on lost men of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Gurkha%20Rifles\"&gt;Royal Gurkha Rifles&lt;/a&gt;. These inform them that they are in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt;: this cave communicates on both sides of the border. Soldiers offer to follow them to &lt;a href=\"Chitral\"&gt;Chitral&lt;/a&gt; (in present-day &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;). From there, Corto leaves for &lt;a href=\"Mumbai\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; (in present-day India), then drives the young girl to Venice, so that she can live with the Armenian community that resides there. They reach their destination in November 1922. In a future adventure in Argentina (in the episode &lt;a href=\"Tango%20%28Corto%20Maltese%29\"&gt;Tango&lt;/a&gt;), Corto will explain to a friend that Rasputin is during this time the host of a &lt;a href=\"Maharaja\"&gt;Maharaja&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nThis episode brings up many characters, some of whom will reappear or be mentioned in later episodes:\nAnalysis.\nHistorical searches.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; (Argentina), Pratt met Armenians who told him about Enver Pasha. They told him about one of the hypotheses about &lt;a href=\"Enver%20Pasha%23Pan-Turkism%20and%20death%2C%201921%E2%80%9322\"&gt;his death&lt;/a&gt;, which he reused in his comic. Speaking of this subject, Pratt wanted to use this \"fascinating character\" in a story, after his friend the French essayist &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Mabire\"&gt;Jean Mabire&lt;/a&gt; explained to him that he was going to write a book about him. Thus, the comic book creator has gathered the necessary documentation. Interestingly, Pratt has used Mabire's book \"Ungern, le Baron fou\" (1973) on &lt;a href=\"Roman%20von%20Ungern-Sternberg\"&gt;Roman von Ungern-Sternberg&lt;/a&gt; in a previous story, &lt;a href=\"Corto%20Maltese%20in%20Siberia\"&gt;Corto Maltese in Siberia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRasputin, main character of this story.\nIn this story, Rasputin steals the limelight from Corto. In fact, that is him the main character and the Maltese mostly makes this trip to save him, more than to find the treasure. Many scenes take place even without Corto! It is therefore fully the opportunity to develop the personality of the Russian and his links with his friend. Corto defines his character by explaining to Abbas that no one knows better than him to destroy anything that could take a sentimental turn. Likewise, Corto will explain to the girl that Rasputin is a villain, but he doesn't know it.\nPratt explains that the difference between Corto and Rasputin is that one is immoral and the other is amoral. He also says that they are complementary. Ras harshly brings Corto back to reality, when he lets himself be carried away by his romanticism. Moreover, the Russian has no qualms to killing a dangerous man, while the Maltese only rarely resolves to it. Speaking to Chevket, then Enver Pasha, Rasputin defines himself as a thief, whose nationality is money. He fights for the military as long as they pay them. He thus plays his own role.\nTributes.\nThe program \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20dessous%20des%20cartes\"&gt;Le dessous des cartes&lt;/a&gt;\" produced an episode on the Corto's journey, presented on the Franco-German channel &lt;a href=\"Arte\"&gt;Arte&lt;/a&gt;"
