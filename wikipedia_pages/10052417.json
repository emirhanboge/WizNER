    "text": "Polymer concrete is a type of &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; that uses &lt;a href=\"polymer\"&gt;polymer&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"lime%20%28material%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;-type &lt;a href=\"cement\"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt;s as a &lt;a href=\"Binder%20%28material%29\"&gt;binder&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to &lt;a href=\"portland%20cement\"&gt;portland cement&lt;/a&gt; to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Concrete%20Institute\"&gt;American Concrete Institute&lt;/a&gt; since 1971.\nComposition.\nIn polymer concrete, &lt;a href=\"thermoplastic%20polymer\"&gt;thermoplastic polymer&lt;/a&gt;s are often used, but more typically &lt;a href=\"Thermosetting%20polymer\"&gt;thermosetting resins&lt;/a&gt; are used as the principal polymer component due to their high thermal stability and resistance to a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"chemicals\"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolymer concrete is also composed of &lt;a href=\"construction%20aggregate\"&gt;aggregates&lt;/a&gt; that include &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20dioxide\"&gt;silica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, and other high quality material. The aggregate should be of good quality, free of &lt;a href=\"dust\"&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"debris\"&gt;debris&lt;/a&gt;, and dry. Failure to fulfill these criteria can reduce the &lt;a href=\"chemical%20bond\"&gt;bond&lt;/a&gt; strength between the polymer binder and the aggregate.\nUses.\nPolymer concrete may be used for new construction or repairing of old concrete. The &lt;a href=\"Adhesion\"&gt;adhesive&lt;/a&gt; properties of polymer concrete allow repair of both polymer and conventional cement-based concretes. The corrosion resistance and low &lt;a href=\"Permeability%20%28earth%20sciences%29\"&gt;permeability&lt;/a&gt; of polymer concrete allows it to be used in swimming pools, sewer structure applications, drainage channels, &lt;a href=\"electrolytic%20cell\"&gt;electrolytic cell&lt;/a&gt;s for base metal recovery, and other structures that contain liquids or corrosive chemicals. It is especially suited to the construction and rehabilitation of manholes due to their ability to withstand toxic and corrosive sewer gases and bacteria commonly found in sewer systems. Unlike traditional concrete structures, polymer concrete requires no coating or welding of PVC-protected seams. It can also be used as a bonded wearing course for &lt;a href=\"Road%20surface%23Asphalt\"&gt;asphalt pavement&lt;/a&gt;, for higher durability and higher strength upon a concrete substrate, and in skate parks, as it is a very smooth surface.\nPolymer concrete has historically not been widely adopted due to the high costs and difficulty associated with traditional manufacturing techniques. However, recent progress has led to significant reductions in cost, meaning that the use of polymer concrete is gradually becoming more widespread.\nProperties.\nThe exact properties depend on the mixture, polymer, aggregate used etc. Generally speaking with mixtures used:\nSpecifications.\nFollowing are some specification examples of the features of polymer concrete:"
