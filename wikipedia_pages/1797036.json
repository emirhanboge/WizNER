    "text": "Wilfred McGuinness (born 25 October 1937) is an English former &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager, who played twice for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in his short playing career. He succeeded Sir &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Busby\"&gt;Matt Busby&lt;/a&gt; as manager of &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; in 1969.\nFollowing his tenure at the Manchester United bench, McGuinness had a four year long stay in Greece, leading &lt;a href=\"Panachaiki%20F.C.\"&gt;Panachaiki&lt;/a&gt; through their first appearance in a &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;European competition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1973\u201374 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcGuinness' son &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McGuinness%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; was Manchester United's U-18 team manager and assistant director of their youth academy for 17- to 21-year-olds.\nPlaying career.\nAs a player, McGuinness captained Manchester, Lancashire and England at schoolboy level, and signed for Manchester United in January 1953. He made his first team debut against &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; on 8 October 1955, turning 18 later that month. Competition for places was fierce but he played in enough matches to qualify for a medal when United won the league in 1956-57.\nHe was still a United player at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20air%20disaster\"&gt;Munich air disaster&lt;/a&gt; in 1958, but an injury had prevented him from playing so he was not on the plane that crashed. A broken leg in the &lt;a href=\"1959-60%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1959\u201360 season&lt;/a&gt; finished his playing career when he was only 22, and came just after he had been capped twice at senior level by the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England team&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagerial career.\nMcGuinness continued to be involved at &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; after the end of his playing career, getting heavily involved in coaching, and in 1964, he replaced &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt; as reserve team manager, as Murphy left that role after managing the reserve team to a sixth &lt;a href=\"FA%20Youth%20Cup\"&gt;FA Youth Cup&lt;/a&gt; triumph. In 1969, McGuinness was promoted from reserve team manager to manager of the first team after Matt Busby retired as manager at the end of the 1968\u201369 season. Appointed as Busby's successor in June 1969 at the age of 31, at a time when the Manchester United side was in transition and Busby had moved upstairs to become general manager, McGuinness's reign as Manchester United manager was not as successful as United had hoped. But McGuinness did lead United to three cup semi-finals during his reign, one in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and two in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcGuinness was sacked in December 1970, after a dramatic comeback which saw United draw 4\u20134 with &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; in a league fixture at the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Ground\"&gt;Baseball Ground&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to his old job as reserve team manager before leaving the club at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; to become manager of Greek side &lt;a href=\"Aris%20F.C.%20%28Thessaloniki%29\"&gt;Aris Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Busby was re-appointed as manager until the end of the &lt;a href=\"1970-71%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;, following McGuinness' dismissal as first team manager, until &lt;a href=\"Frank%20O%27Farrell\"&gt;Frank O'Farrell&lt;/a&gt; was named as &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;'s new manager in June 1971.\nUnder McGuinness, Aris finished fourth in the &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;1971\u201372 Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt; season, and ninth a year later, albeit being tied with three teams in sixth position. He took over &lt;a href=\"Panachaiki%20F.C.\"&gt;Panachaiki&lt;/a&gt; in 1973, finishing sixth in the Alpha Ethniki his first year while advancing to the &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; second round in the team's first ever European campaign. Panachaiki finished seventh in the &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;1974\u201375 Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt; season and parted with McGuinness.\nIn 1975, McGuinness was hired by &lt;a href=\"York%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;York City&lt;/a&gt;. On arriving at York, he took over a side which had just recorded its highest-ever league finish, only to take them through two successive relegations before leaving midway through a season which ended with York having to apply for re-election to the Football League. Later he worked as assistant manager and then caretaker manager at &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;, and was on the coaching staff at &lt;a href=\"Bury%20F.C.\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt; for 10 years, taking over as interim manager prior to the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Ellis%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Sam Ellis&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nManchester United"
