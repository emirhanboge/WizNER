    "text": "Liquidambar, commonly called sweetgum \n(star gum in the UK), \ngum, redgum, satin-walnut, or American storax, is the only genus in the &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; family &lt;a href=\"Altingiaceae\"&gt;Altingiaceae&lt;/a&gt; and has 15 species. They were formerly often treated in &lt;a href=\"Hamamelidaceae\"&gt;Hamamelidaceae&lt;/a&gt;. They are native to Southeast and east Asia, eastern Mediterranean and eastern North America. They are decorative &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; trees that are used in the wood industry and for ornamental purposes.\nEtymology.\nBoth the scientific and common names refer to the sweet &lt;a href=\"resin\"&gt;resin&lt;/a&gt;ous &lt;a href=\"plant%20sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt; (\"liquid &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt;\") exuded by the trunk when cut.\nDescription.\nThey are all large, &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, tall, with &lt;a href=\"leaf%20shape\"&gt;palmate&lt;/a&gt;ly 3- to 7-lobed &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; arranged spirally on the stems and length of , having a pleasant &lt;a href=\"aroma\"&gt;aroma&lt;/a&gt; when crushed. Their leaves can be many colors such as bright red, orange, yellow, and even purple. Mature bark is grayish and vertically grooved. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are small, produced in a dense globular &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; diameter, pendulous on a stem. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a woody multiple &lt;a href=\"capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsule&lt;/a&gt; in diameter (popularly called a \"gumball\"), containing numerous &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s and covered in numerous prickly, woody armatures, possibly to attach to fur of animals. The woody biomass is classified as &lt;a href=\"hardwood\"&gt;hardwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt higher latitudes, Liquidambars are among the last of trees to leaf out in the spring, and also among the last of trees to drop its leaves in the fall/autumn, turning multiple colors. Fall/autumn colors are most brilliant where nights are chilly, but some cultivars color well in warm climates.\nDistribution.\nSpecies within this genus are native to Southeast and east Asia, western Mediterranean and eastern North America. Countries and regions in which they occur are: Indonesia (&lt;a href=\"Nusa%20Tenggara\"&gt;Nusa Tenggara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Jawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatera&lt;/a&gt;); Malaysia (&lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsular Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;); Thailand; &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;; Vietnam; China (including &lt;a href=\"Fujian\"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guizhou\"&gt;Guizhou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hainan\"&gt;Hainan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yunnan\"&gt;Yunnan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zhejiang\"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt;}; Taiwan; &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;; India (including &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;); East Himalaya; Tibet; Turkey; Greece (&lt;a href=\"Rodes\"&gt;Rodes&lt;/a&gt;); Nicaragua; Honduras; El Salvador; Guatemala; Belize; Mexico; and eastern USA (from Texas to Connecticut). It is regarded as introduced/naturalised in Italy, Spain, Belgium and New York, USA. In cultivation they can be seen in warm temperate and subtropical climates around the world. \nFossil records.\nThis genus is known in the fossil record from the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Quaternary\"&gt;Quaternary&lt;/a&gt; (age range: 99.7 to 0.781 million years ago). The genus was much more widespread in the &lt;a href=\"Tertiary\"&gt;Tertiary&lt;/a&gt;, but has disappeared from &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; due to extensive &lt;a href=\"glaciation\"&gt;glaciation&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the east\u2013west oriented &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;, which have served as a blockade against southward migration. It has also disappeared from western &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; due to climate change, and also from the unglaciated (but nowadays too cold) &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Far%20East\"&gt;Russian Far East&lt;/a&gt;. There are several &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt; species of \"Liquidambar\", showing its &lt;a href=\"relict\"&gt;relict&lt;/a&gt; status today.\nUses.\nThe wood is used for furniture, interior finish, paper pulp, veneers and baskets of all kinds. The heartwood once was used in furniture, sometimes as imitation &lt;a href=\"mahogany\"&gt;mahogany&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Juglans%20regia\"&gt;Circassian walnut&lt;/a&gt;. It is used widely today in flake and strand boards. Sweetgum is a foodplant for various &lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"caterpillar\"&gt;caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"gypsy%20moth\"&gt;gypsy moth&lt;/a&gt;. The American sweetgum is widely planted as an ornamental, within its natural range and elsewhere.\nThe hardened sap, or gum resin, excreted from the wounds of the sweetgum, for example, the American sweetgum (\"&lt;a href=\"Liquidambar%20styraciflua\"&gt;Liquidambar styraciflua&lt;/a&gt;\"), can be chewed on like chewing gum and has been long used for this purpose in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern United States&lt;/a&gt;. The sap was also believed to be a cure for &lt;a href=\"sciatica\"&gt;sciatica&lt;/a&gt;, weakness of nerves, etc.\nIn Chinese herbal medicine, \"lu lu tong\", or \"all roads open,\" is the hard, spiky fruit of native sweetgum species. It first appeared in the medical literature in \"Omissions from the Materia Medica,\" by Chen Cangqi, in 720 AD. Bitter in taste, aromatic, and neutral in temperature, \"lu lu tong\" is claimed to promote the movement of blood and &lt;a href=\"qi\"&gt;qi&lt;/a&gt;, water metabolism and urination, expels wind, and unblocks the channels. It is supposedly an ingredient in formulas for epigastric distention or abdominal pain, anemia, irregular or scanty menstruation, low back or knee pain and stiffness, edema with difficult urination, or nasal congestion.\nIn the fall/autumn, the trees drop their hard, spiky seedpods by the hundreds, which can become a serious nuisance on pavements and lawns. Some US cities have expedited permits to remove liquidambar trees."
