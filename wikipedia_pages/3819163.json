    "text": "Glenn Cronin (born 14 September 1981) is an Irish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and former player who is currently assistant coach at &lt;a href=\"Shamrock%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Shamrock Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;League of Ireland Premier Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nExeter City.\nA product of Irish junior club &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Orchard%20F.C.\"&gt;Cherry Orchard&lt;/a&gt;'s well-regarded Youth Academy, Cronin made his debut in 2001, before going onto become a key part of Exeter's first team, playing in central midfield. Following the Grecians' relegation from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 he was made club captain, and despite injury problems that kept him out for much of the 2004/05 season.\nChester City.\nIn July 2006, Cronin signed a contract with &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;Football League Two&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester City&lt;/a&gt;. He missed much of the 2006/07 season with a foot injury. After working his way to recovery, a further foot injury in July 2007 ultimately \ncaused Chester to release him from his contract on 21 November 2007.\nBohemians.\nCronin signed for &lt;a href=\"Bohemian%20F.C.\"&gt;Bohemians&lt;/a&gt; on 27 February 2008 and slotted seamlessly into the side as Bohs marched to the 2008 Premier Division title. Cronin also added an &lt;a href=\"FAI%20Cup\"&gt;FAI Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners medal as Bohs achieved the \"Double\" by beating &lt;a href=\"Derry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Derry City&lt;/a&gt; on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw. The 2009 season was also a successful one for Cronin when, firstly, the Gypsies won the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland%20Cup\"&gt;League of Ireland Cup&lt;/a&gt; by beating &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Waterford United&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20Regional%20Sports%20Centre\"&gt;RSC&lt;/a&gt;. The success did not end there though as Bohemians won their first back-to-back titles in the club's 119-year history, beating rivals &lt;a href=\"Shamrock%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Shamrock Rovers&lt;/a&gt; by 4 points. Despite winning the &lt;a href=\"Setanta%20Sports%20Cup\"&gt;Setanta Sports Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Bohemians had a disappointing 2010 season where the club lost their league title on &lt;a href=\"goal%20difference\"&gt;goal difference&lt;/a&gt; and failed to make an impact in Europe where they made an embarrassing exit to Welsh side &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Saints%20F.C.\"&gt;The New Saints&lt;/a&gt;. Cronin was one of the club's bright spots though as he had his best season at Bohs to date.\nShelbourne.\nFollowing financial cutbacks at Bohemians at the end of the 2011 season, Cronin departed Bohemians after four successful seasons to join newly promoted local rivals &lt;a href=\"Shelbourne%20F.C.\"&gt;Shelbourne&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20League%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;2012 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\nCronin has represented the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at youth and levels.\nCareer statistics.\n\"Correct as of 26 October 2012.\"\n&lt;br&gt;"
