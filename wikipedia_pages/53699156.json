    "text": "Bol\u00e9ro is an album by jazz guitarist &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Coryell\"&gt;Larry Coryell&lt;/a&gt; that was released by String Records in 1981. The album was released on CD in 1993 by &lt;a href=\"Evidence%20Music\"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt; and includes the tracks from the LP \"At the Airport\" (1983) recorded with guitarist &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Keane\"&gt;Brian Keane&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\n&lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; awarded the album with 4 out of 5 stars. The \"Penguin Guide\" review gave 2.5 stars out of 4 and said, \"Coryell had already tackled Ravel (and Robert de Visee) on \"The Restful Mind\" and it was inevitable that he would add \"Bol\u00e9ro\" to \"Pavane for a Dead Princess\". Ravel was a perfectly logical focus for Coryell and he also tackles the prelude from \"Le Tombeau De Couperin\", lending it an elaborate contrapuntal feel that almost buries the intriguing modal progression that links it to the gypsy and flamenco traditions that intrigue both men.\"\nCoryell performed the \"Improvisation on Bol\u00e9ro\" at the &lt;a href=\"Guitar%20Legends%2C%20Seville%201991\"&gt;\"Guitar Legends Festival\" in Seville, October 1991&lt;/a&gt;."
