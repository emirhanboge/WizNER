    "text": "Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I of Serbia (; ; 18 March 1780 or 1783 \u2013 26 September 1860) born Milo\u0161 Teodorovi\u0107 (; ), also known as Milo\u0161 the Great () was the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Prince of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; from 1815 to 1839, and again from 1858 to 1860. He participated in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Serbian%20uprising\"&gt;First Serbian uprising&lt;/a&gt;, led &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Serbian%20uprising\"&gt;Second Serbian uprising&lt;/a&gt;, and founded the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Obrenovi%C4%87\"&gt;House of Obrenovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Under his rule, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; became an autonomous &lt;a href=\"principality\"&gt;principality&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Prince Milo\u0161 ruled autocratically, consistently refusing to share power, which generated strong domestic opposition. During his rule, Milo\u0161 I bought a number of estates and ships from Ottoman Turks and also became a prominent trader. Although coming from humble beginnings, he eventually became the richest man in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and one of the richest in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, with estates in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nMilo\u0161 Teodorovi\u0107 was the son of Teodor \"Te\u0161a\" Mihailovi\u0107 (died 1802) from &lt;a href=\"Gornja%20Dobrinja\"&gt;Dobrinja&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baba%20Vi%C5%A1nja\"&gt;Vi\u0161nja&lt;/a&gt; (died 18 June 1817). His family descended from the &lt;a href=\"Bratono%C5%BEi%C4%87i\"&gt;Bratono\u017ei\u0107i&lt;/a&gt; tribe. This was the second marriage of his mother Vi\u0161nja, from which also sprung &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Obrenovi%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan&lt;/a&gt; (1787\u20131850) and &lt;a href=\"Jevrem%20Obrenovi%C4%87\"&gt;Jevrem&lt;/a&gt; (1790\u20131856). From Vi\u0161nja's first marriage, with Obren Martinovi\u0107 (died 1780) from &lt;a href=\"Brusnica%2C%20Gornji%20Milanovac\"&gt;Brusnica&lt;/a&gt;, Milo\u0161 had half-brothers Jakov (died 1811) and &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Obrenovi%C4%87%20%28revolutionary%29\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; (died 1810), and half-sister Stana. After the death of Obren, Vi\u0161nja moved from Brusnica and married Teodor in Dobrinja.\nAlthough many historians put 1780 as the year when Milo\u0161 was born, according to foundation plaque in the wall of the Old Church in Kragujevac, his capital, he was 35 when the church was finished in 1818, meaning that he was born in 1783. After the death of his brother Milan, a famed revolutionary with great reputation among the people, Milo\u0161 adopted the surname Obrenovi\u0107. In official documents, his name was sometimes written Milo\u0161 Teodorovi\u0107 Obrenovi\u0107 (; ).\nFirst Serbian Uprising.\nMilo\u0161 fought in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Serbian%20uprising\"&gt;First Serbian uprising&lt;/a&gt; until its very end in 1813. He was wounded in the battle for &lt;a href=\"U%C5%BEice\"&gt;U\u017eice&lt;/a&gt;. His half-brother Milan also took part in the Uprising, rising to become the &lt;a href=\"voivode\"&gt;voivode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rudnik%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Rudnik&lt;/a&gt; district, until his death in 1810. After Milan's death, Milo\u0161 adopted the surname of his half-brother, Obrenovi\u0107. This name was the &lt;a href=\"patronymic\"&gt;patronymic&lt;/a&gt; which his half-brother derived from Obren, the first name of his own father (Milo\u0161's step-father). After the rebellion collapsed, Milo\u0161 was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the returning &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Serbian Uprising.\nIn April 1815, Prince Milo\u0161 organized and led the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Serbian%20uprising\"&gt;Second Serbian uprising&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the Turks, and Napoleon's defeat in Russia, the Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815. After the killing of &lt;a href=\"Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e%20Petrovi%C4%87\"&gt;Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, in 1817, Obrenovi\u0107 became the leader of the Serbs. As a result of the agreement, Serbia gained some autonomy, but remained under &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; sovereignty. Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 was left in power as its absolute ruler.\nBetween the end of 1828 and the autumn of 1830, Prince Milo\u0161 created a so-called \"legislative commission\" to translate the &lt;a href=\"Code%20Napol%C3%A9on\"&gt;Code Napol\u00e9on&lt;/a&gt; into Serbian and codify the laws and customs of the country. After discussing the commission, Milo\u0161 invited two distinguished legal specialists to come from Hungary to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for Serbia. They were Vasilije Lazarevi\u0107, \"B\u00fcrgermeister\" (mayor) of &lt;a href=\"Zemun\"&gt;Zemun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Had%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Jovan Had\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, lawyer, poet, and member of the municipal senate of &lt;a href=\"Novi%20Sad\"&gt;Novi Sad&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 1831, Prince Milo\u0161 informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial &lt;a href=\"edict\"&gt;edict&lt;/a&gt; from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;'s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; a sovereign principality, with Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 as hereditary prince. A &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Metropolitanate of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; was established in Belgrade as an autonomous unit of the &lt;a href=\"Ecumenical%20Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Patriarchate of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s status as the guarantor of &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;'s autonomy was also recognized.\nReign.\nThe supporters of the rule of law often rebelled against Milo\u0161's government. Following one such rebellion, he agreed to adopt a constitution, the \"Sretenje\" or Candlemas constitution, in 1835. The move was opposed by neighboring &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20monarchy\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia. It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. &lt;a href=\"Metternich\"&gt;Metternich&lt;/a&gt;'s Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and &lt;a href=\"foreign%20ministry\"&gt;foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt;. Milo\u0161 abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, and it was replaced by the \"Turkish\" &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20constitution%20%28Serbia%29\"&gt;Constitution of 1838&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilo\u0161 abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons\u2014&lt;a href=\"Milan%20Obrenovi%C4%87%20II%2C%20Prince%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, who died a few weeks later, and &lt;a href=\"Mihailo%20Obrenovi%C4%87%20III%2C%20Prince%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Mihailo&lt;/a&gt;, who then became prince. Mihailo was deposed in 1842, and the family was out of power until 1858, when it returned with Milo\u0161 restored as prince for the last two years of his life.\nThanks to his good contacts during his stay in Vienna, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Strauss%20II\"&gt;Johann Strauss II&lt;/a&gt; composed the \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Johann%20Strauss%20II%23Quadrilles\"&gt;Serben-Quadrille&lt;/a&gt;\" intended for Serbian balls.\nLegacy.\nMilo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 was given the epithet \"the Great\". He was proclaimed \"Father of the Fatherland\" by the National Assembly.\nMarriage and children.\nIn 1805, Milo\u0161 married &lt;a href=\"Ljubica%20Vukomanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Ljubica Vukomanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (September 1785 \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, 26 May 1843). The couple had eight children whose names are known. It is speculated that Ljubica had other pregnancies that resulted in &lt;a href=\"miscarriage\"&gt;miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stillbirth\"&gt;stillbirth&lt;/a&gt;s, or children who died shortly after birth, with some sources giving a number as high as 17 pregnancies."
