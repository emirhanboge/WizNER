    "text": "Afro\u2013Latin Americans or Black Latin Americans (sometimes \"&lt;a href=\"Afro-Latinos\"&gt;Afro-Latinos&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Afro-Latinx\"), are &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Americans\"&gt;Latin Americans&lt;/a&gt; of full or mainly &lt;a href=\"Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; ancestry.\nThe term \"Afro\u2013Latin American\" is not widely used in &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; outside academic circles. Normally Afro\u2013Latin Americans are called \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;\" (; or ; ). Latin Americans of African ancestry may also be denoted by the prefix \"Afro-\" plus a specific &lt;a href=\"nationality\"&gt;nationality&lt;/a&gt;, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Afro-Brazilians\"&gt;Afro-Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Afro-Cubans\"&gt;Afro-Cuban&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Afro-Haitians\"&gt;Afro-Haitian&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe accuracy of &lt;a href=\"Demography\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; reporting on Afro\u2013Latin Americans has been questioned, especially where they are derived from &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; reports in which the subjects choose their own designation, because in various countries the concept of &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; ancestry is viewed with differing attitudes.\nHistory.\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, many people of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; origin were brought to the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, while some arrived as part of exploratory groups. A notable example of the latter was the black &lt;a href=\"conquistador\"&gt;conquistador&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Garrido\"&gt;Juan Garrido&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced wheat to Mexico. &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Alonso%20Ni%C3%B1o\"&gt;Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, traditionally considered the first of many New World explorers of African descent, was a navigator in the 1492 &lt;a href=\"Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Columbus expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Those who were directly from West Africa mostly arrived in Latin America as part of the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;Atlantic slave trade&lt;/a&gt;, as agricultural, domestic, and menial laborers and as mineworkers. They were also employed in &lt;a href=\"Cartography\"&gt;mapping&lt;/a&gt; and exploration (for example, &lt;a href=\"Estevanico\"&gt;Estevanico&lt;/a&gt;) and were even involved in conquest (for example, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Valiente\"&gt;Juan Valiente&lt;/a&gt;.) The Caribbean and South America received 95 percent of the Africans arriving in the Americas with only 5 percent going to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20America\"&gt;Northern America&lt;/a&gt;.\nCountries with significant African, Mulatto, or Zambo populations today include Brazil (54 million, if including the &lt;a href=\"pardo\"&gt;pardo&lt;/a&gt; Brazilian population with Mulatto phenotype), &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; (8.7\u00a0million), &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; (8.5 million), &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; (7 million), Colombia (5 million), Venezuela (4 million) and &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; (1.1 million).\nTraditional terms for Afro\u2013Latin Americans with their own developed culture include \"&lt;a href=\"gar%C3%ADfuna\"&gt;gar\u00edfuna&lt;/a&gt;\" (in &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honduras\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Belize\"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt;), \"&lt;a href=\"cafuzo\"&gt;cafuzo&lt;/a&gt;\" (in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"zambo\"&gt;zambo&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marabou%20%28ethnicity%29\"&gt;Marabou&lt;/a&gt; is a term of Haitian origin denoting a Haitian of multiracial ethnicity.\nThe mix of these African cultures with the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and indigenous cultures of Latin America has produced many unique forms of &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Palenquero\"&gt;Palenquero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gar%C3%ADfuna\"&gt;Gar\u00edfuna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Creole\"&gt;Creole&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Afro-American%20religion\"&gt;religions&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Candombl%C3%A9\"&gt;Candombl\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santer%C3%ADa\"&gt;Santer\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"West%20African%20Vodun\"&gt;Vodou&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Latin%20American%20music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Compas\"&gt;kompa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salsa%20music\"&gt;salsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bachata%20%28dance%29\"&gt;Bachata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punta\"&gt;Punta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palo%20de%20Mayo\"&gt;Palo de Mayo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plena\"&gt;plena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"samba\"&gt;samba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merengue%20music\"&gt;merengue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cumbia\"&gt;cumbia&lt;/a&gt;) martial arts (&lt;a href=\"capoeira\"&gt;capoeira&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"dance\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cuban%20rumba\"&gt;rumba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merengue%20%28dance%29\"&gt;merengue&lt;/a&gt;).\nAs of 2015, Mexico and Chile are the only two Latin American countries yet to formally recognize their Afro\u2013Latin American population in their constitutions. This is in contrast to countries like Brazil and Colombia that lay out the constitutional rights of their African-descendant population.\nRacial and ethnic distinctions.\nTerms used within Latin America used in reference to African heritage include \"mulato\" (African \u2013 white mixture), \"zambo/chino\" (indigenous \u2013 African mixture) and \"pardo\" (African \u2013 native \u2013 white mixture) and \"mestizo\", which refers to an indigenous \u2013 European mixture in all cases except for in Venezuela, where it is used in place of \"pardo\". The term \"mestizaje\" refers to the intermixing or fusing of ethnicities, whether by mere custom or deliberate policy. In Latin America this happened extensively between all ethnic groups and cultures, but usually involved European men and &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; and African women.\nRepresentation in the media.\nAfro\u2013Latin Americans have limited media appearance; critics have accused the Latin American media of overlooking the African, indigenous and multiracial populations in favor of over-representation of often &lt;a href=\"blond\"&gt;blond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20eye\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"green-eyed\"&gt;green-eyed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"white%20Latin%20Americans\"&gt;white Latin Americans&lt;/a&gt; as they share features of typical &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Europe\"&gt;Southern Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans with some &lt;a href=\"mestizo\"&gt;mestizo&lt;/a&gt; features to create a more distinct look often seen in popular &lt;a href=\"telenovela\"&gt;telenovela&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSouth America.\nArgentina.\nAccording to the Argentina national census of the year 2010, the total Argentine population is 40,117,096, from which 149,493 are of African ancestry.\nTraditionally it has been argued that the black population in Argentina declined since the early 19th century to insignificance. Many believe that the black population declined due to systematic efforts to reduce the black population in Argentina in order to mirror the racially homogeneous countries of Europe. However, the pilot census conducted in two neighborhoods of Argentina in 2006 on knowledge of ancestors from Sub-saharan Africa verified that 5% of the population knew of Black African ancestry, and another 20% thought that it was possible but were not sure. Given that European immigration accounted for more than half the growth of the Argentine population in 1960, some researchers argue that, rather than decrease, what occurred was a process of overlaying, creating the \"invisibility\" of the population of Afro-Argentines and their cultural roots.\nBolivia.\nAfrican descendants in Bolivia account for about 1% of the population. They were brought in during the Spanish colonial times and the majority live in the &lt;a href=\"Yungas\"&gt;Yungas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrazil.\nAround 7% of Brazil's 190 million people reported to the census as &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, and many more Brazilians have some degree of African descent.\nBrazil experienced a long internal struggle over abolition of slavery and was the last Latin American country to do so. In 1850 it finally banned the importation of new slaves from overseas, after two decades since the first official attempts to outlaw the human traffic (in spite of illegal parties of Black African slaves that kept arriving until 1855). In 1864 Brazil emancipated the slaves, and on 28 September 1871, the Brazilian Congress approved the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Branco%20Law\"&gt;Rio Branco Law&lt;/a&gt; of Free Birth, which conditionally freed the children of slaves born from that day on. In 1887 &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; officers refused to order their troops to hunt runaway slaves, and in 1888 the Senate passed a law establishing immediate, unqualified emancipation. This law, known as \"&lt;a href=\"Lei%20%C3%81urea\"&gt;Lei \u00c1urea&lt;/a&gt;\" (Golden Law) was sanctioned by the regent &lt;a href=\"Isabel%2C%20Princess%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the emperor &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Pedro II&lt;/a&gt; on 13 May 1888.\nAfrican contribution to the genetic composition of Brazilians.\nEuropean ancestry has primarily contributed to the formation of Brazil, along with African and Native American ancestries.\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees: \"Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population\".\nA recent &lt;a href=\"Autosome\"&gt;autosomal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from all over the country (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\") found a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component. \"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil), and also public health institutions personnel and health students. The study showed that Brazilians from different regions are more homogenous than previously thought by some based on the census alone. \"Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, a lot greater between Brazilian regions than within Brazilian regions\".\nAccording to a DNA study from 2010, which used samples from the five regions of the country \"on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%.\" The study by a team of the &lt;a href=\"Universidade%20Cat%C3%B3lica%20de%20Bras%C3%ADlia\"&gt;Catholic University of Bras\u00edlia&lt;/a&gt; and published by the scientific magazine \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Journal%20of%20Human%20Biology\"&gt;American Journal of Human Biology&lt;/a&gt;\", show that \"in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin, eye, and hair color have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies (regardless of census classification).\" The study used ancestry informative SNPs to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. It found the \"Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture\" and estimated the major contribution being European ancestry (77.1%) followed by African (14.3%) and Amerindian contributions (8.5%). It is important to note that \"the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: \"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although \"likely to be leaning slightly \"towards the \u2018'pardo'\u2019 group\"\".\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 similarly found that \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Bras\u00edlia (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.9% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.8%) and the Native American (9.3%).\nS\u00e3o Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of S\u00e3o Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American. A more recent genetic study, from 2013, showed that people in S\u00e3o Paulo have 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Amerindian ancestries, respectively.\nChile.\nChile enslaved about 6,000 &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;ns, about one-third of whom arrived before 1615; most were utilized in agriculture around &lt;a href=\"Santiago\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;. Today there are very few Afro-Chileans, at the most, fewer than 0.001% can be estimated from the 2006 population.\nIn 1984, a study called \"Sociogenetic Reference Framework for Public Health Studies in Chile\", from the Revista de Pediatr\u00eda de Chile determined an ancestry of 67.9% European, and 32.1% Native American. In 1994, a biological study determined that the Chilean composition was 64% European and 35% Amerindian. The recent study in the Candela Project establishes that the genetic composition of Chile is 52% of European origin, with 44% of the genome coming from Native Americans (Amerindians), and 4% coming from Africa, making Chile a primarily mestizo country with traces of African descent present in half of the population. Another genetic study conducted by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Brasilia\"&gt;University of Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; in several American countries shows a similar genetic composition for Chile, with a European contribution of 51.6%, an Amerindian contribution of 42.1%, and an African contribution of 6.3%. In 2015 another study established genetic composition in 57% European, 38% Native American, and 2.5% African.\nColombia.\nAfro-Colombians make up 9.34% of the population, almost 4.7 million people, according to a projection of the National Administration Department of Statistics (DANE). most of whom are concentrated on the northwest Caribbean coast and the Pacific coast in such departments as &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Choc%C3%B3\"&gt;Choc\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, although considerable numbers are also in &lt;a href=\"Cartagena%2C%20Colombia\"&gt;Cartagena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barranquilla\"&gt;Barranquilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Andres%20Island\"&gt;San Andres Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately 4.4\u00a0million Afro-Colombians actively recognize their own black ancestry as a result of inter-racial relations with white and indigenous Colombians. They have been historically absent from high level government positions. Many of their long-established settlements around the Pacific coast have remained underdeveloped. In Colombia's ongoing internal conflict, Afro-Colombians are both victims of violence or displacement and members of armed factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Autodefensas%20Unidas%20de%20Colombia\"&gt;AUC&lt;/a&gt;. Afro-Colombians have played a role in contributing to the development of certain aspects of Colombian culture. For example, several of Colombia's musical genres, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Cumbia\"&gt;Cumbia&lt;/a&gt;\", have African origins or influences. Some Afro-Colombians have also been successful in sports such as &lt;a href=\"Faustino%20Asprilla\"&gt;Faustino Asprilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20Rinc%C3%B3n\"&gt;Freddy Rinc\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Isabel%20Urrutia\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Isabel Urrutia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Basilio%20de%20Palenque\"&gt;San Basilio de Palenque&lt;/a&gt; is a village in Colombia that is noted for maintaining many African traditions. It was declared a &lt;a href=\"Masterpieces%20of%20the%20Oral%20and%20Intangible%20Heritage%20of%20Humanity\"&gt;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&lt;/a&gt; by UNESCO in 2005. The residents of Palenque still speak &lt;a href=\"Palenquero\"&gt;Palenquero&lt;/a&gt;, a Spanish/African creole.\nEcuador.\nIn 2006, Ecuador had a population of 13,547,510. According to the latest data from CIA World Factbook, the ethnic groups represented in Ecuador include mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white; 71.9%), &lt;a href=\"Montubio\"&gt;Montubio&lt;/a&gt; (7.4%), Amerindian (7%), white (6.1%), Afroecuadorian (4.3%), mulato (1.9%), and black (1%). The Afro-Ecuadorian culture is found in the northwest coastal region of &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; and make up the majority (70%) in the province of &lt;a href=\"Esmeraldas%20Province\"&gt;Esmeraldas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chota%20Valley\"&gt;Chota Valley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imbabura%20Province\"&gt;Imbabura Province&lt;/a&gt;. They can be also found in Ecuador's two largest cities, &lt;a href=\"Quito\"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guayaquil\"&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;. The best known cultural influence known outside Ecuador is a distinctive kind of &lt;a href=\"marimba\"&gt;marimba&lt;/a&gt; music. From the &lt;a href=\"Chota%20Valley\"&gt;Chota Valley&lt;/a&gt; there is \"&lt;a href=\"Bomba%20%28Ecuador%29\"&gt;Bomba (Ecuador)&lt;/a&gt;\" music which is very different from marimba from Esmeraldas.\nParaguay.\nBlack Paraguayans are descended from enslaved West Africans brought to Paraguay beginning in the 16th century. They became a significant presence in the country, and made up 11% of the population in 1785. Most Afro-Paraguayans established communities in towns such as &lt;a href=\"Aregu%C3%A1\"&gt;Aregu\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emboscada%20District\"&gt;Emboscada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guarambar%C3%A9\"&gt;Guarambar\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Many achieved their freedom during the Spanish rule. In the capital &lt;a href=\"Asunci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Asunci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, there is a community of 300 Afro-Paraguayan families in the Fernando de la Mora municipality.\nPeru.\nAfro-Peruvians made up about 2.65% of the population (close to eight hundred thousand people).\nOver the course of the slave trade, approximately 95,000 slaves were brought into Peru, with the last group arriving in 1850. Today, Afro-Peruvians reside mainly on the central and south coasts. Afro-Peruvians can also be found in significant numbers on the northern coast. Recently, it has been verified that the community with the greatest concentration of Afro-Peruvians is Yapatera in Morrop\u00f3n (Piura), made up of around 7,000 farmers who are largely descended from African slaves of \"malagasy\" (&lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;) origin. They are referred to as \"malgaches\" or \"mangaches\".\nAfro-Peruvian music and culture was popularized in the 1950s by the performer &lt;a href=\"Nicomedes%20Santa%20Cruz\"&gt;Nicomedes Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2006, his birthday, 4 June, has been celebrated in Peru as a Day of Afro-Peruvian Culture. Another key figure in the revival of Afro-Peruvian music is &lt;a href=\"Susana%20Baca\"&gt;Susana Baca&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfro-Peruvian music was actually well known in Peru since the 1600s but oppressed by the Peruvian elite, as was Andean religion and language.\nAfro-Peruvian culture has not only thrived but influenced all aspects of Peruvian culture despite lacking any acknowledgment from mainstream media or history.\nUruguay.\nA 2009 DNA study in the \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Journal%20of%20Human%20Biology\"&gt;American Journal of Human Biology&lt;/a&gt;\" showed the genetic composition of Uruguay as primarily European, with Native American ancestry ranging from one to 20 percent and sub-Saharan African \"from seven to 15 percent (depending on region)\".\nEnslaved Africans and their descendants figured prominently in the founding of Uruguay.\nIn the late 18th century, Montevideo became a major arrival port for slaves, most brought from Portuguese colonies of Africa and bound for the Spanish colonies of the New World, the mines of Peru and Bolivia, and the fields of Uruguay.\nIn the 19th century, when Uruguay joined other colonies in fighting for independence from Spain, Uruguayan national hero &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Artigas\"&gt;Jose Artigas&lt;/a&gt; led an elite division of black troops against the colonists. One of his top advisors was &lt;a href=\"Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Lenzina\"&gt;Joaqu\u00edn Lenzina&lt;/a&gt;, known as Ansina, a freed slave who composed musical odes about his commander's exploits and is regarded by Afro-Uruguayans as an unheralded father of the nation.\nVenezuela.\nAfrican &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;ns are mostly descendants of enslaved Africans brought to Venezuela from the 17th to the 19th century to work the coffee and cocoa crops. Most of the African-Venezuelans live in the North-central region, in the coastal towns &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20%28state%29\"&gt;Barlovento&lt;/a&gt;, Northern &lt;a href=\"Yaracuy\"&gt;Yaracuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carabobo\"&gt;Carabobo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aragua%20State\"&gt;Aragua State&lt;/a&gt;s, and Eastern &lt;a href=\"Vargas%20State\"&gt;Vargas State&lt;/a&gt;; but also in several towns and villages in areas in South Lake Maracaibo (Zulia State) and Northern &lt;a href=\"Merida%20State\"&gt;Merida State&lt;/a&gt; in the Andes, among others. They have kept their traditions and culture alive, especially through music.\nVenezuela is a very racially mixed nation, which makes it difficult to individually identify and/or distinguish their ethno-racial background with precision. Research in 2001 on genetic diversity by the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (\"Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas\", IVIC) in which the population was compared to the historical patterns of the colonial castes. According to the last population census in Venezuela conducted by the National Institute Estadististica (INE), 2.8% of the country's population identifies as afrodescendientes of the national total, which is 181 157 result in the number of Venezuelans with African racial characteristics. However, most &lt;a href=\"Venezuelans\"&gt;Venezuelans&lt;/a&gt; have some Sub-Saharan African heritage, even if they identify as white.\nAfro-Venezuelans have stood out as sportsmen, many of them in the Major League Baseball and other sports (e.g. former &lt;a href=\"NBA\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Houston%20Rockets\"&gt;Houston Rockets&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Herrera\"&gt;Carl Herrera&lt;/a&gt;), however, most of them do not describe themselves as Afro-Venezuelan, but as Latinos or Hispanics or simply Venezuelans. Afro-Venezuelans have also stood out in the arts, especially in music, for example: &lt;a href=\"Magdalena%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Magdalena S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20D%27Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Oscar D'Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morella%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;Morella Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Phillips\"&gt;Allan Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, Pedro Eustache, Frank Quintero, and many others. Miss Venezuela 1998, &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20Indriago\"&gt;Carolina Indriago&lt;/a&gt;, Miss Venezuela Universe 2006, Jictzad Vi\u00f1a, and Miss Venezuela World 2006, &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Carrizo\"&gt;Susan Carrizo&lt;/a&gt; are mulatto.\nCentral America.\nThe Afro\u2013Latin Americans of Central America come from the Caribbean coast. The countries of &lt;a href=\"Belize\"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honduras\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, are of &lt;a href=\"Gar%C3%ADfuna\"&gt;Gar\u00edfuna&lt;/a&gt;, Afro-Caribbean and/or &lt;a href=\"Mestizo\"&gt;Mestizo&lt;/a&gt; heritage, as well as of &lt;a href=\"Miskito%20people\"&gt;Miskito&lt;/a&gt; heritage. Those of &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; are mostly of Afro-Caribbean heritage. Many Afro-Caribbean islanders arrived in Panama to help build the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; and to Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to work in the &lt;a href=\"banana\"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; and sugar-cane plantations.\nBelize.\nBelizean culture is a mix of African, European, and &lt;a href=\"Maya%20society\"&gt;Mayan&lt;/a&gt; but only 21% of the population is considered to be of African descent. The main community of African descent are the &lt;a href=\"Belizean%20Creole%20people\"&gt;Creoles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garifuna%20people\"&gt;Garifuna&lt;/a&gt; concentrated from the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20District\"&gt;Cayo District&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Belize%20District\"&gt;Belize District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stann%20Creek%20District\"&gt;Stann Creek District&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dangriga\"&gt;Dangriga&lt;/a&gt;) on the Caribbean Sea. &lt;a href=\"Belize%20City\"&gt;Belize City&lt;/a&gt;, on the Caribbean coast, is the center of West African culture in Belize, with its population being of mixed Black African, Maya, and European.\nCosta Rica.\nAbout 8% of the population is of African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called &lt;a href=\"Afro-Costa%20Rican\"&gt;Afro-Costa Rican&lt;/a&gt;s representing more than 390,000 people spread nowadays all over the country, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n immigrant workers. The indigenous population numbers around 2.5%. In the &lt;a href=\"Guanacaste%20Province\"&gt;Guanacaste Province&lt;/a&gt;, a significant portion of the population descends from a mix of local &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt;s, Africans and Spaniards. Most Afro-Costa Ricans are found in the &lt;a href=\"Lim%C3%B3n%20Province\"&gt;Lim\u00f3n Province&lt;/a&gt; and the Central Valley.\nEl Salvador.\nOnly 0.13% of the population is black in El Salvador. Approximately 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador. The African population, creating Afro-Mestizos in the certain areas where the Africans were brought. El Salvador has no English Antillean (West Indian), Garifuna, and Miskito population, largely due to laws banning the immigration of Africans into the country in the 1930s; these laws were revoked in the 1980s.\nGuatemala.\nOnly 2% of the Guatemalan population is considered black or mulatto. The main community of African heritage is the &lt;a href=\"Garifuna%20people\"&gt;Garifuna&lt;/a&gt;, concentrated in &lt;a href=\"Livingston%2C%20Guatemala\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Barrios\"&gt;Puerto Barrios&lt;/a&gt;. The rest are Afro-Caribbean and mulattoes who live in Puerto Barrios and &lt;a href=\"Morales%2C%20Guatemala\"&gt;Morales&lt;/a&gt;. All these places belong to the &lt;a href=\"Izabal%20Department\"&gt;Izabal department&lt;/a&gt;, located on the Caribbean coast. Because of unemployment and lack of opportunities, many Garifuna from Guatemala have left the country and moved to Belize and the United States. Also many people of African descent are located in different regions of the country, but most notable are in &lt;a href=\"Amatitl%C3%A1n\"&gt;Amatitl\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Jer%C3%B3nimo%2C%20Baja%20Verapaz\"&gt;San Jer\u00f3nimo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jutiapa%20department\"&gt;Jutiapa&lt;/a&gt;, although most of them may not recognize it because the loss of culture in these places. Based on oral local history in San Jeronimo of Alta Vera Paz, it is told that a ship carrying enslaved people from Africa broke on the shores of Guatemala prior to the European invasion. The ship had broken on the shores and the enslaved people became free people with the enslavers dead. The oral history continues to claim that the name Alta Verapaz \u2013 the land of \" High True Peace\" was given to that territory by the Spaniards after conquering the people of African and Mayan descent through religion \u2013 the cross \u2013 and not the sword as in other parts of Guatemala. The reason is Africans and Mayans had joined forces and defeated the Spanish Sword. Africans and Mayans have also intermarried tracing back generations prior to the Garifuna along the Coast. Many more Africans joined VeraPaz once the Spaniards conquered the area through religion, bringing about large sugar cane plantations that required more laborers, and unfortunately enslaved peoples.\nMany of the slaves brought from Africa during colonial times came to Guatemala to work on cotton, sugar cane, tobacco, and coffee plantations. Most were brought as slaves and also servants by European conquistadors. The main reason for slavery in Guatemala was because of the large sugar-cane plantations and haciendas located on Guatemala's Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Slavery didn't last too long during those times and all slaves and servants brought were later freed. They spread to different locations, primarily Guatemala's north, south and east. It is said that these freed slaves later mixed with Europeans, Native Indigenous, and Creoles (Criollos) of non-African descent.\nThe national folk instrument, the marimba, has its origins in Africa and was brought to Guatemala and the rest of Central America by African slaves during colonial times. The melodies played on it show Native American, West African and European influences in both form and style.\nAmong the notable Garifuna from Guatemala are social leaders (Mario Ellington and Dilia Palacios Cayetano), musicians (&lt;a href=\"Sof%C3%ADa%20Blanco\"&gt;Sof\u00eda Blanco&lt;/a&gt;, Silvia Blanco and Jursino Cayetano), poets (Nora Murillo and Wingston Gonz\u00e1lez), athletes (Teodoro Palacios Flores and Mario Blanco), soccer players (Guillermo \"la Pantera\" Enr\u00edquez Gamboa, Tom\u00e1s Enr\u00edquez Gamboa, German Trigue\u00f1o Castro, Clemente Lal\u00edn S\u00e1nchez, Wilson Lal\u00edn Salvatierra, Carlos Delva, Norman Delva, David Suazo, Tom\u00e1s Suazo, Braulio Arz\u00fa, &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Trigue%C3%B1o\"&gt;Ricardo Trigueno Foster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Ram%C3%ADrez\"&gt;Guillermo Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt; \"el Pando\", &lt;a href=\"Florencio%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Florencio Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt;, Renato Blanco and &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Avila\"&gt;Marvin Avila&lt;/a&gt;), basketball players (Juan Pablo Trigue\u00f1o Foster), a wrestler (\"El Cadete del Espacio\") and a model (Deborah David).\nFrom the Afro-Caribbean community come doctors (Henry Stokes Brown and his son, Wilfredo Stokes Baltazar; Arla Cinderella Stokes), psychologists (Elizabeth Stokes), deacons (Sydney Samuels), a poet (Alan Mills), a journalist (Glenda Stokes Weatherborn), athletes (Roy Fearon, Salom\u00f3n Rowe, Octavio Guillespie and Lidia Graviola Ewing), soccer players (Ricardo Clark, Jorge Lynch, Jerry Slosher, Royston Hall, David Stokes, Tony Edwin, Oscar Sims, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Sims%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Willie Sims&lt;/a&gt;, Vicente Charles, Jos\u00e9 A.

Frank Taylor, with roots from San Jeronimo and born in Quirigua, was the first Black entertainer with their own national television show singing in five languages with the likes of Julio Iglesias as Frank's guest.\nToday, the Garifuna and Afro-Caribbean people of Guatemala are organized in a group called Organizaci\u00f3n Negra Guatemalteca (Onegua). According to its website, Onegua is \"a nongovernmental organization established in 1995 with a mandate to promote the interests and fight for the rights of Guatemala's Garifuna and Afrodescendant populations\". There is also an association called \"Asociaci\u00f3n Ra\u00edces Afrodescendientes Guatemaltecas.\"\nOn 26 November 2009 Afro descendants mostly of Garifuna heritage and all mixes came to the Catedral Metropolitana located in Guatemala City for a church event organized by Garifunas from Izabal, Guatemala to prove that after 200 years of Garifuna existence in Guatemala they are not considered part of the population of Guatemala. The main reason for this event was to prove a point to stop discrimination against Afro descendants and other ethnic groups in Guatemala. According to the 2002 census of Guatemala only 5,040 people identified themselves as Afro descendants during that time, which was 0.04% of the country's population.\nThose numbers have gradually increased during the years after this 2009 event, which caused a huge controversy all over the country when it was aired on TV. After Many different regions of Guatemala have since identified some inhabitants as Afro descendants with some mixed ancestry.\nIt is important to note that in a country with has been historically dominated by the Catholic religion, many throughout the Country worship a black Christ \u2013 Esquipulas. Many Catholics within Central America do a pilgrimage to the Church of Se~nor Esquipulas to request for a miracle or thank him for having provided one. Walking into the church, one could find crutches and wheel chairs as remnants of people's past tribulations that they supposedly leave behind as they walk out of the Church with Se~nor Esquipulas haven granted their miracle.\nHonduras.\nThe official &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Honduras\"&gt;census of Honduras&lt;/a&gt; indicates that 2% of the population, or about 150,000 individuals, self-identified as black. A more recent and accurate estimate indicates that there are around 600,000 &lt;a href=\"Garifuna%20people\"&gt;Garifuna&lt;/a&gt; Afro-Hondurans (8% of the population) which is closer to the estimate given by the National Assembly of Afro-Honduran Organizations and Communities. The census number is based on self-identification and does not use the American definition of blood quantum to identify \"blackness\" as &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Louis%20Gates\"&gt;Henry Gates&lt;/a&gt; does in his estimate of the black population of Honduras: \"Estimates of people of African descent in Honduras vary widely, from 100,000 to 320,000 (1.8 to 5.8 percent of the country's 5.8\u00a0million people in 1994).\"\nIf one uses the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20quantum%20laws\"&gt;blood quantum&lt;/a&gt; definition of blackness, then blacks came to Honduras early in the colonial period. One of the mercenaries who aided &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20de%20Alvarado\"&gt;Pedro de Alvarado&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Honduras\"&gt;conquest of Honduras&lt;/a&gt; in 1536 was a black slave working as a mercenary to earn his freedom. Alvarado sent his own slaves from Guatemala to work the &lt;a href=\"Placer%20mining\"&gt;placer&lt;/a&gt; gold deposits in western Honduras as early as 1534. The earliest black slaves consigned to Honduras were part of a license granted to the Bishop &lt;a href=\"Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Pedraza\"&gt;Crist\u00f3bal de Pedraza&lt;/a&gt; in 1547 to bring 300 slaves into Honduras.\nThe self-identifying black population in Honduras is mostly of &lt;a href=\"West%20Indian\"&gt;West Indian&lt;/a&gt; (Antillean origin), descendants of indentured laborers brought from &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and other Caribbean Islands or of &lt;a href=\"Garifuna%20people\"&gt;Garifuna&lt;/a&gt; (or Black Caribs) origin, a people of Black African ancestry who were expelled from the island of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vincent%20%28island%29\"&gt;Saint Vincent&lt;/a&gt; after an uprising against the English and in 1797 and were exiled to &lt;a href=\"Roatan\"&gt;Roatan&lt;/a&gt;. From there they made their way along the Caribbean coast of Belize, mainland Honduras and Nicaragua. Large Garifuna settlements in Honduras today include Trujillo, La Ceiba, and Triunfo de la Cruz. Even though they only came to Honduras in 1797, the Garifuna are one of the seven officially recognized indigenous groups in Honduras.\nSlaves on the north coast mixed with the &lt;a href=\"Miskito%20people\"&gt;Miskito&lt;/a&gt; Indians, forming a group referred to as the Zambo Miskito. Some Miskito consider themselves to be purely indigenous, denying this Black African heritage. They do not, however, identify as such but rather as mestizo. The Black Creoles of the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Islands%20%28department%29\"&gt;Bay Islands&lt;/a&gt; are today distinguished as an ethnic group for their racial difference from the mestizos and blacks, and their cultural difference as &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;-speaking &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt;.There has been practically\nno ethnographic research conducted with this population.\nAll these circumstances led to a denial by many Hondurans of their Black African heritage which reflects in the census even to this day. \"Blacks were more problematic as national symbols because at the time they were neither seen to represent modernity nor autochthony, and their history of dislocation from Africa means they have no great pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas to call upon as symbols of a glorious past. Thus Latin American states often end up with a primarily \"Indo-Hispanic\" mestizaje where the Indian is privileged as the roots of the nation and blackness is either minimized or completely erased.\"\nNicaragua.\nAbout 9% of Nicaragua's population is African and mainly reside on the country's sparsely populated Caribbean coast. Afro-Nicaraguans are found on the autonomous regions of &lt;a href=\"Regi%C3%B3n%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20del%20Atl%C3%A1ntico%20Norte\"&gt;RAAN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regi%C3%B3n%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20del%20Atl%C3%A1ntico%20Sur\"&gt;RAAS&lt;/a&gt;. The African population is mostly of &lt;a href=\"Antilles\"&gt;West Indian&lt;/a&gt; (Antillean) origin, the &lt;a href=\"Kinship\"&gt;descendants&lt;/a&gt; of laborers brought mostly from &lt;a href=\"Colony%20of%20Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"British%20West%20Indies\"&gt;Caribbean islands&lt;/a&gt; when the region was a &lt;a href=\"British%20protectorate\"&gt;British protectorate&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a smaller number of &lt;a href=\"Gar%C3%ADfuna\"&gt;Gar\u00edfuna&lt;/a&gt;, a people of mixed &lt;a href=\"Kalina%20people\"&gt;Carib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Angola\"&gt;Angolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kongo%20people\"&gt;Congolese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arawaks\"&gt;Arawak&lt;/a&gt; descent. The Gar\u00edfuna live along in Orinoco, La Fe and Marshall Point, communities settled at &lt;a href=\"Laguna%20de%20perlas\"&gt;Laguna de Perlas&lt;/a&gt;. Nicaragua has the largest population of blacks in &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom these regions come artists, writers and poets such as June Beer, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Rigby\"&gt;Carlos Rigby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20McField\"&gt;David McField&lt;/a&gt; (current Nicaraguan ambassador in Jamaica), Clifford Glenn Hodgson Dumbar, Andira Watson and John Oliver, and diplomats and politicians like &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Campbell\"&gt;Francisco Campbell&lt;/a&gt; (current ambassador in the USA) and &lt;a href=\"Lumberto%20Campbell\"&gt;Lumberto Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. Among the musicians are Caribbean All Stars, Atma Terapia Arjuna Das, Osberto Jerez y Los Gregorys, Caribbean Taste, Spencer Hodgson, Philip Montalb\u00e1n, Grupo Gamma, Anthony Matthews and Dimension Coste\u00f1a, Charles Wiltshire (also known as \"Carlos de Nicaragua\", who played with &lt;a href=\"Mano%20Negra%20%28band%29\"&gt;Mano Negra&lt;/a&gt; in its 1994 record &lt;a href=\"Casa%20Babylon\"&gt;Casa Babylon&lt;/a&gt;) and dancer Gloria Bacon.

The Afro Colonials are the group of Hispanics, while the Antillanos are those of West Indian descent.\nFamous Afro-Panamanians include boxer &lt;a href=\"Eusebio%20Pedroza\"&gt;Eusebio Pedroza&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaribbean.\nCuba.\nAccording to a 2001 national census which surveyed 11.2\u00a0million Cubans, 1.1\u00a0million Cubans described themselves as &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, while 5.8\u00a0million considered themselves to be \"mulatto\" or \"mestizo\" or \"javao\" or \"moro\". Many Cubans still locate their origins in specific African ethnic groups or regions, particularly &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20people\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kongo%20people\"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20people\"&gt;Igbo&lt;/a&gt;, but also Arar\u00e1, Carabal\u00ed, Mandingo, Fula and others, as well as a small minority of people who migrated in from surrounding Caribbean countries like Haiti and Jamaica.\nAn autosomal study from 2014 has found out the genetic ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American.\nAmong the most famous Afro-Cubans are writers &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Guill%C3%A9n\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gast%C3%B3n%20Baquero\"&gt;Gast\u00f3n Baquero&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Morej%C3%B3n\"&gt;Nancy Morej\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;; musicians &lt;a href=\"Celia%20Cruz\"&gt;Celia Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Mor%C3%A9\"&gt;Benny Mor\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Compay%20Segundo\"&gt;Compay Segundo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rub%C3%A9n%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28pianist%29\"&gt;Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20%26quot%3BCachaito%26quot%3B%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Orlando \"Cachaito\" L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omara%20Portuondo\"&gt;Omara Portuondo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Ferrer\"&gt;Ibrahim Ferrer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Buena%20Vista%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/a&gt;; jazz musicians including &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Bauz%C3%A1\"&gt;Mario Bauz\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongo%20Santamar%C3%ADa\"&gt;Mongo Santamar\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chucho%20Vald%C3%A9s\"&gt;Chucho Vald\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Rubalcaba\"&gt;Gonzalo Rubalcaba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anga%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Anga D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"X%20Alfonso\"&gt;X Alfonso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Milan%C3%A9s\"&gt;Pablo Milan\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;; other musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Bebo%20Vald%C3%A9s\"&gt;Bebo Vald\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Israel%20%26quot%3BCachao%26quot%3B%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orestes%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Orestes L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Eg%C3%BCes\"&gt;Richard Eg\u00fces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1maso%20P%C3%A9rez%20Prado\"&gt;D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado&lt;/a&gt;, Christina Milian and &lt;a href=\"Tata%20G%C3%BCines\"&gt;Tata G\u00fcines&lt;/a&gt;; and politicians &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Almeida\"&gt;Juan Almeida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esteban%20Lazo\"&gt;Esteban Lazo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDominican Republic.\nAccording to the recent sources, 11% of the Dominican population is black, 16% is white and 73% is mixed from white European and black African and Native American ancestry. Other sources give similar figures, but also without naming a specific study. Other estimates puts the Dominican population at 90% Black and Mulatto, and 10% White.\nSome Afrocentric commentators and race/ethnicity scholars have been harshly critical of Dominicans of mixed racial background for their reluctance to self-identify as \"Black\". However, this reluctance is shared by many people of multiracial background, who find inappropriate to identify with only one side of their ancestry. Those people refuse to express a preference for any of the races that make up their background, and resent being ascribed to any single race.\nDominican culture is a mixture of Taino Amerindian, Spanish European, and West African origins. While Taino influences are present in many Dominican traditions, the European and West African influences are the most noticeable.\nAfro-Dominicans can be found all over the island, but they makeup the vast majorities in the southwest, south, east, and the north parts of the country. In &lt;a href=\"El%20Cibao\"&gt;El Cibao&lt;/a&gt; one can find people of either European, Mixed, and African descent.\nMost Afro-Dominicans descend from the &lt;a href=\"Bantu%20peoples\"&gt;Bantu&lt;/a&gt; tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Congo%20Basin\"&gt;Congo region&lt;/a&gt; of Central Africa (&lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;), and as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ga-Adangbe%20people\"&gt;Ga&lt;/a&gt; people of west &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable Dominicans whose physical features suggest full or predominant Black African ancestry include &lt;a href=\"bachata%20%28music%29\"&gt;bachata&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href=\"Antony%20Santos\"&gt;Antony Santos&lt;/a&gt;, baseballer &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Sosa\"&gt;Sammy Sosa&lt;/a&gt; and salsa singer &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Alberto%20%26quot%3BEl%20Canario%26quot%3B\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Alberto \"El Canario\"&lt;/a&gt;, and basketballer &lt;a href=\"Al%20Horford\"&gt;Al Horford&lt;/a&gt;, among others. However, there is no reliable procedure to ascertain the degree, if any, to which their ancestry is Black African.\nA &lt;a href=\"Casta\"&gt;system of racial stratification&lt;/a&gt; was imposed on Santo Domingo by Spain, as elsewhere in the Spanish Empire.\nGuadeloupe.\nThe population of Guadeloupe, an overseas region of France, is 405,739 (1 January 2013 est.); 80% of the population has African and African-white-Indian mixture which emphasizes its diversity. Their West African ancestors were imported from the &lt;a href=\"Bight%20of%20Biafra\"&gt;Bight of Biafra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kongo\"&gt;West Central Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Guinea%20Coast\"&gt;Guinean Coast&lt;/a&gt; for sugar cane plantation labor during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Antillean%20Creole\"&gt;Antillean Creole&lt;/a&gt;, which is a French-based creole, is the local language widely spoken among the natives of the island and even the immigrants who have been living on the island for a couple of years. French, the official language, is still the most common language used and heard on the island. Used during more intimate/friendly conversations, Guadeloupean people switch to French, which is their first and native language, when in public.\nHaiti.\nThe population of Haiti is 9.9\u00a0million, of which 80% are of African descent while 15-20% is &lt;a href=\"mulatto\"&gt;mulatto&lt;/a&gt; and white. Slavery in Haiti was established by the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; colonialists. Many Haitians are descendants of &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%ADno%20people\"&gt;Taino&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Island%20Caribs\"&gt;Caribs&lt;/a&gt; who cohabited with the &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n descendant population.\nHaiti is an Afro-Latin nation with strong African contributions to the culture as well as its language, music and religion with a fusion of French and Taino, with a sizable degree of Spaniard; all relate and are not limited to its food, art, music, folk religion and other customs. Arab customs are also present in their society today.\nMartinique.\nThe population of Martinique, an overseas region of France, is 390,371 (1 January 2012 est.); 80% of the population has African and African-white-Indian mixture which emphasizes its diversity. Their West African ancestors were imported from the &lt;a href=\"Bight%20of%20Biafra\"&gt;Bight of Biafra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kongo\"&gt;West Central Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Guinea%20Coast\"&gt;Guinean Coast&lt;/a&gt; for sugar cane plantation labor during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Antillean%20Creole\"&gt;Antillean Creole&lt;/a&gt;, which is a French-based creole, is the local language widely spoken among the natives of the island and even the immigrants who have been living on the island for a couple of years. However, French, the official language, is still the most common language used and heard on the island. Used during more intimate/friendly conversations, Martinican people switch to French, which is their first and native language, when in public.\nPuerto Rico.\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census taken in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, 17.1% of Puerto Ricans identified as being white, 7% of the population as being black or African American and 75.3% as mixed or of another ethnicity. An island-wide &lt;a href=\"mitochondrial%20DNA\"&gt;mitochondrial DNA&lt;/a&gt; (mtDNA) study conducted by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Puerto%20Rico%20at%20Mayag%C3%BCez\"&gt;University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 61% of Puerto Ricans have maternal Native American ancestry, 26.4% have maternal &lt;a href=\"West%20Africa\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Central%20Africa\"&gt;Central Africa&lt;/a&gt;n ancestry, and 12.6% have maternal European ancestry. On the other hand, the &lt;a href=\"Y%20chromosome\"&gt;Y chromosome&lt;/a&gt; evidence showed Puerto Ricans' patrilineage to be approximately 75% European, 20% African, and less than 5% indigenous.\nAn interesting anecdote to consider was that during this whole period, Puerto Rico had laws like the \"Regla del Sacar\" or \"Gracias al Sacar\" by which a person of African ancestry could be considered legally white so long as they could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white descent. Therefore, people of African ancestry with known European lineage were classified as \"whites\", the opposite of the \"&lt;a href=\"one-drop%20rule\"&gt;one-drop rule&lt;/a&gt;\" in the United States.\nThese critics maintain that a majority of Puerto Ricans are ethnically mixed, but do not feel the need to identify as such. They argue, furthermore, that Puerto Ricans tend to assume that they are of African, Native American, and European ancestry and only identify themselves as \"mixed\" if parents visibly \"appear\" to be of some other ethnicity. It should also be noted that Puerto Rico underwent a \"whitening\" process while under U.S. rule. The census-takers at the turn of the 20th Century recorded a huge disparity in the number of \"black\" and \"white\" Puerto Ricans (both, erroneous skin classifications) between the 1910 and 1920 censuses. The term \"black\" suddenly began to disappear from one census to another (within 10 years' time), possibly due to redefinition. It also appears that the \"black\" element within the culture was simply disappearing possibly due to the popular idea that in the U.S. one could only advance economically and socially if one were to pass for \"white\".\nMisinformation of ethnic populations within Puerto Rico also existed under Spanish rule, when the Native American (Taino) populations were recorded as being \"extinct\". Biological science has now rewritten their history books. These tribes were not voluntary travelers, but have since blended into the mainstream Puerto Rican population (as all the others have been) with Taino ancestry being the common thread that binds.\nMany persons of African descent in Puerto Rico are found along coastal areas, areas traditionally associated with sugar cane plantations, especially in the towns &lt;a href=\"Loiza%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Loiza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carolina%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fajardo%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Fajardo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guayama%2C%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Guayama&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the DNA evidence that is being presented by UPR at Mayaguez, many African bloodlines have been recorded in the central mountains of the island, though not written in the Spanish history books of the time. Consequently, Taino bloodlines have begun appearing in the coastal towns. All of this suggests that escaped enslaved Africans ran off to the mountains to escape the slaveowners, while some Tainos remained close to their main staple food, fish.\nThe Puerto Rican musical genres of \"&lt;a href=\"bomba%20%28Puerto%20Rico%29\"&gt;bomba&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"plena\"&gt;plena&lt;/a&gt;\" are of West African and Caribbean origin, respectively; they are danced to during parties and West African-derived festivals. Most Puerto Ricans who have African ancestry are descendants of enslaved &lt;a href=\"Kongo%20people\"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20people\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20people\"&gt;Igbo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fon%20people\"&gt;Fon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20regions%20of%20Africa\"&gt;West and Central Africa&lt;/a&gt;. After the abolition of slavery in 1873 and the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, a number of &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;s have also migrated and settled in Puerto Rico.\nThree of the most famous Afro\u2013Latin Americans are Puerto Rican Boxer &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20Trinidad\"&gt;Felix \"Tito\" Trinidad&lt;/a&gt;, Hall of Fame baseball player &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Clemente\"&gt;Roberto Clemente&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Williams\"&gt;Bernie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; outfielder and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20jazz%20guitarists\"&gt;jazz guitarist&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorth America.\nMexico.\nThe vast majority of contemporary Afro-Mexicans inhabit the southern region of Mexico; those who migrated north in the colonial period assimilated into the general population, making their existence in the country less evident than other groups. Some Afro-Mexican facts:\nUnited States.\nMany Afro-Latino immigrants have arrived, in waves, over decades, to the United States, especially from the Caribbean, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. In the state of California, the dominant population consisted of people of color but as the years progressed the percentage has declined severely or at least the way Californian residents claim to identify themselves has shifted towards a White population. A Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults shows that one-quarter of all U.S. Latinos self-identify as Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean or of African descent with roots in Latin America. This is the first time a nationally representative survey in the U.S. has asked the Latino population directly whether they considered themselves Afro-Latino. Among the &lt;a href=\"Chicano\"&gt;Chicano&lt;/a&gt;/a population, people who are both Black and Chicano/a may identify as AfroChicano/a."
