It was released theatrically and &lt;a href=\"Video%20on%20demand\"&gt;video-on-demand&lt;/a&gt; on 5 September 2014 in the United States.\nReception.\n\"God Help the Girl\" received mixed reviews. Review aggregator &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; reports a 67% approval rating based on 76 reviews, with an average score of 5.69/10. The site's consensus reads: \"While it may strike harder-hearted viewers as excessively twee, \"God Help the Girl\" floats by on its sweet charm and talented cast.\"\nDennis Harvey of \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that \"God Help the Girl \"\"is a slender exercise in self-conscious charm\". David Fear of \"&lt;a href=\"Esquire%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Esquire&lt;/a&gt;\" praised it as \"rife with the kind of giddy thrills and hormonal flushes you associate with being a teen.\" Jonathan Romney of \"Film Comment Magazine\" said that \"it's easy to categorize Murdoch's film as a vanity project, but if it is, it's a very honest one\". David D'Arcy of \"&lt;a href=\"Screen%20International\"&gt;Screen International&lt;/a&gt;\" said the film \"has a soft whimsy that connects to a time before video clips put editing rhythms into overdrive\".\nXan Brooks of the \"&lt;a href=\"theguardian.com\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the film three out of five, writing: \"It's warm and generous, verging on the sentimental; a film that crystallises the best and worst of Belle and Sebastian's songwriting skills.\" In &lt;a href=\"Vulture%20%28blog%29\"&gt;\"Vulture\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Rabin\"&gt;Nathan Rabin&lt;/a&gt; named the film one of 10 Sundance movies that \"should have been hits\", writing: \"Murdoch has long been an extraordinarily cinematic songwriter, with a gift for conjuring up melancholy worlds with his words and music. With \"God Help the Girl,\" he proves to be a predictably literary and musical filmmaker ... \"God Help the Girl\" represents the perfect cinematic representation of Belle and Sebastian\u2019s worldview, which, depending on your opinion of the group, is either high praise or a terrific reason to stay away.\"\nLeslie Felperin of the \"Guardian \"gave \"God Help the Girl\" two out of five stars and called it \"disastrous, fatally flawed by a shoddy script and poor direction, like something made by the most ostensibly talented guy at art school ... It's not funny or clever, or even musically very interesting. It's just bad.\" Rodrigo Perez of \"&lt;a href=\"Indiewire\"&gt;Indiewire&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"A major gaffe, \"God Help The Girl\" finds a great artist taking on a huge challenge and stumbling painfully on its ambition almost every step of the way.\" David Rooney of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollywood%20Reporter\"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\" called the film \"an indie musical that feels like one long B-side\".\nSarah Sahim, writing for &lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20Media\"&gt;\"Pitchfork\"&lt;/a&gt;, called the film \"an egregious mess\" that romanticizes &lt;a href=\"eating%20disorder\"&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt;s. She criticised the film's lack of racial diversity as \"a microcosmic view of what is wrought by racial exclusivity that is omnipresent in indie rock\". Murdoch responded to Sahim's article on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, writing: \"God knows I've yearned to know and love women and men of many nations, but being a poor sick white boy from Scotland has dashed my ambitions.\""
