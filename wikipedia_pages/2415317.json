    "text": "Hassan Shehata (; born 19 June 1949) is an Egyptian former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player. Before retirement he played as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;. He then became a football manager, who is now retired. Shehata led Egypt to victory in 3 titles, all which were at the African Cup of Nations: 2006, 2008 and 2010. He was the first ever coach to win three consecutive Africa Cup of Nations titles. Shehata is one of only two coaches to win the Africa Cup 3 times, along with Ghana's &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gyamfi\"&gt;Charles Gyamfi&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagerial career.\nIn 2004, Shehata became &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt's national team&lt;/a&gt; coach after the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Tardelli\"&gt;Marco Tardelli&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2006%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2006 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, he led the team to its first Cup of Nations in eight years, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt; in the final.\nDuring the African Cup semi-final against &lt;a href=\"Senegal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, Shehata had a serious argument with one of his players, &lt;a href=\"Mido%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Mido&lt;/a&gt;. That was a resultant of Mido reacting negatively to being substituted. Shehata was vindicated minutes later when &lt;a href=\"Amr%20Zaki\"&gt;Amr Zaki&lt;/a&gt;, the player replacing Mido, scored the winning goal; which took Egypt to the final. Shehata did allow Mido to accept his medal at the closing ceremonies of the African Cup of Nations. Following the incident in a few days, Mido issued a public apology.\nAs mentioned earlier, Shehata led Egypt to three successive titles at the &lt;a href=\"African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2008%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2010%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Egypt became the first African nation to achieve such record. Consequently, the Egyptian team were ranked as high as 9th in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Rankings\"&gt;FIFA World Rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his great coaching ability throughout during that period, In 2008, he was awarded the title of &lt;a href=\"CAF%20Awards\"&gt;CAF Coach of the Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2010, &lt;a href=\"International%20Federation%20of%20Football%20History%20%26amp%3B%20Statistics\"&gt;FFHSI&lt;/a&gt; had ranked him as the best African Coach. He was also selected as one of the top five African coaches internationally.\nIn 2015, he became President of the SATUC Football Cup, a new charitable global football competition for U16 orphans, refugees and disadvantaged children."
