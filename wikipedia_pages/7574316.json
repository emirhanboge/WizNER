Some of the most important residents in the valleys held a meeting on 15 July 1771 with the intention of formalising the creation of the parish. They petitioned the Spanish monarch Carlos IV, to be granted the title of Villa for the settlement.\nConsequently, on 18 May 1792, the title of \"Noble, Leal y Valerosa Villa\" was granted by Royal Warrant to the parish of Our Lady of the Rosary. Villa del Rosario contributed many great men, most notably General Francisco de Paula Santander, famous as a soldier and legislator, whose achievements in the Revolution and the formation of the Republic made him prominent in public administration and the founding of Colombia's particular form of democracy.\nClimate.\nThis area typically has a pronounced dry season. According to the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20Climate%20Classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification&lt;/a&gt; system, Villa del Rosario has a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20savanna%20climate\"&gt;tropical savanna climate&lt;/a&gt;, abbreviated \"Aw\" on climate maps."
