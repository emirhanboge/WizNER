    "text": "\"'Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?\" is a song written by the &lt;a href=\"comedian\"&gt;comedian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexei%20Sayle\"&gt;Alexei Sayle&lt;/a&gt;, originally released as a &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; in the UK in 1982. The single eventually achieved &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Top Twenty&lt;/a&gt; success in 1984, following a &lt;a href=\"reissue\"&gt;reissue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe song and its title have subsequently been adapted and reused in a number of different cultural contexts.\nSong structure.\nThe song is predominantly a &lt;a href=\"rapping\"&gt;rap&lt;/a&gt; comprising a mix of banal, &lt;a href=\"Surreal%20humour\"&gt;absurd&lt;/a&gt; and generally &lt;a href=\"Non%20sequitur%20%28literary%20device%29\"&gt;unconnected sentences&lt;/a&gt; (including the song's title), each sentence being delivered twice in succession. Occasionally, a succeeding line provides the &lt;a href=\"punch%20line\"&gt;punch line&lt;/a&gt; to the preceding one. These rap passages are occasionally interrupted by short comic monologues or the consecutive repetition of the song's title for an extended period.\nThe UK single features four versions of the song spread across the 7- and 12-inch formats, and designated \"Part I\" through \"Part IV\". All versions feature the same &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt; musical backdrop, but lyrically the versions are distinct from each other.\nLyrical themes.\nAll versions of the song feature &lt;a href=\"Cockney%23Cockney%20speech\"&gt;Cockney&lt;/a&gt; phrasing and slang, often heavily stylised for comic effect. Hence, in the song's title, \"'ullo\" is \"&lt;a href=\"Hello%23Hullo\"&gt;hullo&lt;/a&gt;\" with a &lt;a href=\"Phonological%20history%20of%20English%20fricatives%20and%20affricates%23H-dropping\"&gt;dropped-H&lt;/a&gt;, \"John\" is a colloquial &lt;a href=\"placeholder%20name\"&gt;placeholder name&lt;/a&gt; (comparable to \"&lt;a href=\"Mate%20%28colloquialism%29\"&gt;mate&lt;/a&gt;\"), and \"motor\" is shortened slang for \"&lt;a href=\"Automobile\"&gt;motor car&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; placenames are mentioned in the song, including &lt;a href=\"Peckham\"&gt;Peckham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bermondsey\"&gt;Bermondsey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stanmore\"&gt;Stanmore&lt;/a&gt;. Originally released in 1982, the song references several then topical themes, such as the ongoing construction of the &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Barrier\"&gt;Thames Barrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecurrent among these themes is the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt;'s announced decision to replace the long-running &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Cortina\"&gt;Ford Cortina&lt;/a&gt; brand with the new &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Sierra\"&gt;Ford Sierra&lt;/a&gt; by September 1982. The song asserts the \"poetry\" of the Cortina, and the superior sound of the name \"Cortina\" to \"Sierra\", with varying degrees of vigour, during \"Part II\" to \"Part IV\" of the song.\nThis lyrical theme was reflected in the marketing of the single: the single's front cover features Sayle leaning against a Ford Cortina Mark V, the rear cover features a reproduction of a Ford press release for the 1973 Cortina 2000E model, and the 1983 reissue included a &lt;a href=\"Unusual%20types%20of%20gramophone%20records%23Picture%20discs\"&gt;picture disc format&lt;/a&gt; featuring Sayle reclining on the &lt;a href=\"Hood%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;bonnet&lt;/a&gt; of a Cortina Mark III.\n\"Part IV\" of the song, included on the UK 12-inch, differs significantly from the other three versions lyrically, featuring a sustained onslaught of high-speed &lt;a href=\"profanity\"&gt;profanity&lt;/a&gt; and faux-&lt;a href=\"coprolalia\"&gt;coprolalia&lt;/a&gt;, which was adapted from the \"Mr. Sweary\" routine then current in Sayle's live &lt;a href=\"stand-up%20comedy\"&gt;stand-up&lt;/a&gt; act. \"Part IV\" also contains profane variations and &lt;a href=\"parody\"&gt;parodies&lt;/a&gt; of some of the lyrics and monologues featured in the other versions of the song.\nLargely as a consequence of \"Part IV\", the reissued 12-inch sleeve was labelled with a warning sticker that read: \"This record contains explicit language \u2013 Abusive, lewd and funny \u2013 Expletives not deleted\".\nChart success.\nThe single was not a hit upon original release, but it received a reissue from Island Records in late 1983, by which time Sayle had appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Gorky%20Park%20%28film%29\"&gt;Gorky Park&lt;/a&gt;\" and several TV shows, including the first series of the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"situation%20comedy\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Young%20Ones%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Young Ones&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"ITV%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; sitcom \"&lt;a href=\"Whoops%20Apocalypse\"&gt;Whoops Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe re-issued single eventually reached number 15 in the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March 1984.\nCultural influence.\nThe song and its title have been adapted and reused numerous times in a variety of contexts.\nAround the time of the single's initial release (1982) BBC2 Arena had made a programme detailing the cultural influence of the Ford Cortina and its recently announced demise; \"The Private Life of the Ford Cortina\" in which Sayle (the presenter) talks through the influence of the car on the post war working classes and also features villain John McVicar (who appears on the cover artwork alongside Sayle) discussing Britain's most stolen car of the period.\nIn 1985, &lt;a href=\"Toshiba\"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; ran a TV advertising campaign that featured the song with altered lyrics \u2013 \"'Ello Tosh! Gotta Toshiba?\" \u2013 performed by &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Dury\"&gt;Ian Dury&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon an obscenity trial over their song \"Bata Motel\", the anarchist punk band &lt;a href=\"Crass\"&gt;Crass&lt;/a&gt; presented the b-side to this song as an example that there were much more obscene records out there than \"Bata Motel\". While it was being played, much of the court responded with uproarious laughter. This outraged the magistrates, who threatened anyone who laughed with a charge for contempt of court. This resulted in members of the band reportedly biting their lips so hard that they bled, so as to prevent themselves from laughing.\nThe #18 UK single \"&lt;a href=\"Has%20It%20Come%20to%20This%3F\"&gt;Has it Come To This?&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001) from the ground-breaking UK Hip-Hop/Rap album \"&lt;a href=\"Original%20Pirate%20Material\"&gt;Original Pirate Material&lt;/a&gt;\" appears to reference the song in the lyric \"Bravery in the face of defeat\nAll line up and grab yer seat - Cos Tony's got a new motor - SR Nova driving like a joyrider - Speeding to the corner -\nYer mother warned it'll be a sound system banger\"\nIn 2005, the song was revived for a new Toshiba campaign featuring vocalist &lt;a href=\"Suggs%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Suggs&lt;/a&gt;, Toshiba's advertising agency claiming that \"the 'ello Tosh tagline has gone down in advertising history, demonstrated by the fact people still remember it today\".\nSayle himself has commented on the longevity of the song's title, in his column for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Independent\"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;\": \"There is seldom a magazine or newspaper article even loosely connected with cars or the transport industry in general that doesn't use some variation of that title. Only last week there was a piece in the \"&lt;a href=\"Evening%20Standard\"&gt;London Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt;\" about powerful in-car stereos entitled, 'Ullo Jon, Gotta New Woofer?' In fact sometimes the articles don't even have anything to do with cars.\"\nLooking back on the single itself almost twenty years after its release, Sayle has also stated: \"It is a really good song! Original, tuneful and the only Top 20 record to mention tropical fish and Peckham.\"\nOther versions.\nUpon release of the single, Sayle performed the song live on the TV series \"&lt;a href=\"O.T.T.\"&gt;O.T.T.&lt;/a&gt;\", broadcast 27 February 1982, using a musical backing track that differed from the released single.\nSayle also performed the song on the &lt;a href=\"live%20album\"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"comedy%20album\"&gt;comedy album&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Cak%21\"&gt;Cak!&lt;/a&gt;\", released later in 1982. This album also contained \"Say Hello Mr. Sweary\", an example of the routine that provided the lyrical concept for \"Part IV\" of \"'Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?\".\nSayle performed the song, with different lyrics (\"out here it's really breezy coz I'm riding free and easy/I got a brand new Morrison, a brand new 10-speed Morrison\") on a &lt;a href=\"TV%20commercial\"&gt;TV commercial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for Morrison &lt;a href=\"bicycle\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSingle releases.\nAll tracks written by Alexei Sayle except \"Pop Up Toasters\" by Sayle/&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Bogdanovs\"&gt;Harry Bogdanovs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll tracks produced by &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Langer\"&gt;Clive Langer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Winstanley\"&gt;Alan Winstanley&lt;/a&gt; except \"Pop Up Toasters\" produced by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Lewis%20%28humorist%29\"&gt;Martin Lewis&lt;/a&gt;."
