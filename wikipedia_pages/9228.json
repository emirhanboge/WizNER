    "text": "Earth is the third &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and the only &lt;a href=\"astronomical%20object\"&gt;astronomical object&lt;/a&gt; known to harbor life. While large &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20lakes%20and%20seas%20in%20the%20Solar%20System\"&gt;amounts of water&lt;/a&gt; can be found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt;, only &lt;a href=\"Water%20distribution%20on%20Earth\"&gt;Earth sustains liquid surface water&lt;/a&gt;. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;tectonic plate&lt;/a&gt;s, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid &lt;a href=\"outer%20core\"&gt;outer core&lt;/a&gt; generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's &lt;a href=\"magnetosphere\"&gt;magnetosphere&lt;/a&gt;, deflecting destructive &lt;a href=\"solar%20wind\"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20atmosphere\"&gt;Earth's atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; consists mostly of &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by &lt;a href=\"Atmospheric%20circulation\"&gt;atmospheric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20circulation\"&gt;ocean circulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Water%20vapor\"&gt;Water vapor&lt;/a&gt; is widely present in the atmosphere and &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20formation\"&gt;forms clouds&lt;/a&gt; that cover most of the planet. &lt;a href=\"Greenhouse%20gases\"&gt;Greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; in the atmosphere like &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (CO2) trap a part of the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20irradiance\"&gt;energy from the Sun&lt;/a&gt; close to the surface. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.\n&lt;a href=\"Earth%20ellipsoid\"&gt;Earth is an ellipsoid&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20circumference\"&gt;a circumference&lt;/a&gt; of about 40,000\u00a0km. It is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Solar%20System%20objects%20by%20size\"&gt;densest planet in the Solar System&lt;/a&gt;. Of the four &lt;a href=\"rocky%20planet\"&gt;rocky planet&lt;/a&gt;s, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight &lt;a href=\"light%20minute\"&gt;light minute&lt;/a&gt;s away from the Sun and &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20orbit\"&gt;orbits it&lt;/a&gt;, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20rotation\"&gt;Earth rotates&lt;/a&gt; around its own axis in a day. &lt;a href=\"%23Axial%20tilt%20and%20seasons\"&gt;Earth's axis of rotation&lt;/a&gt; is tilted with respect to its orbital plane with the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one &lt;a href=\"claimed%20moons%20of%20Earth\"&gt;permanent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"natural%20satellite\"&gt;natural satellite&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;, which orbits Earth at 380,000\u00a0km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through &lt;a href=\"tidal%20locking\"&gt;tidal locking&lt;/a&gt; and causes &lt;a href=\"tide\"&gt;tide&lt;/a&gt;s, stabilizes Earth's axis and &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20acceleration\"&gt;gradually slows its rotation&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarth formed &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Earth\"&gt;over 4.5 billion years ago&lt;/a&gt;. During the first &lt;a href=\"billion%20years\"&gt;billion years&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20history\"&gt;Earth's history&lt;/a&gt;, the ocean formed and then &lt;a href=\"Abiogenesis\"&gt;life developed&lt;/a&gt; within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to Earth's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oxidation%20Event\"&gt;Great Oxidation Event&lt;/a&gt; two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's &lt;a href=\"biosphere\"&gt;biosphere&lt;/a&gt; and natural resources for their survival, but have &lt;a href=\"Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment\"&gt;increasingly impacted Earth's environment&lt;/a&gt;. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters and ecosystems is &lt;a href=\"sustainability\"&gt;unsustainable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Global%20environmental%20inequality\"&gt;threatening people&lt;/a&gt;'s lives and &lt;a href=\"Holocene%20extinction\"&gt;causing widespread extinction of other life&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"modern%20English\"&gt;modern English&lt;/a&gt; word \"Earth\" developed, via &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt;, from an &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; noun most often spelled '. It has cognates in every &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic language&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"proto-Germanic\"&gt;ancestral root&lt;/a&gt; has been reconstructed as &lt;a href=\"wikt%3AAppendix%3AProto-Germanic/er%C3%BE%C5%8D\"&gt;*\"er\u00fe\u014d\"&lt;/a&gt;. In its earliest attestation, the word \"eor\u00f0e\" was already being used to translate the many senses of &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; ' and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"g\u0113\": the ground, its &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman &lt;a href=\"Terra%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Terra&lt;/a&gt;/Tell\u016bs and Greek &lt;a href=\"Gaia%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;, Earth may have been a &lt;a href=\"earth%20goddess\"&gt;personified goddess&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20religion%20%28aboriginal%29\"&gt;Germanic paganism&lt;/a&gt;: late &lt;a href=\"Norse%20mythology\"&gt;Norse mythology&lt;/a&gt; included &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6r%C3%B0\"&gt;J\u00f6r\u00f0&lt;/a&gt; ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorically, \"earth\" has been written in lowercase. From &lt;a href=\"early%20Middle%20English\"&gt;early Middle English&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Definite%20article\"&gt;definite sense&lt;/a&gt; as \"the globe\" was expressed as \"the\" earth. By &lt;a href=\"Early%20Modern%20English\"&gt;Early Modern English&lt;/a&gt;, many nouns were capitalized, and \"the earth\" was also written \"the Earth\", particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as \"Earth\", by analogy with the names of the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;other planets&lt;/a&gt;, though \"earth\" and forms with \"the\" remain common. &lt;a href=\"Style%20guide\"&gt;House styles&lt;/a&gt; now vary: &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20spelling\"&gt;Oxford spelling&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (for example, \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by \"the\" (for example, \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"\nOccasionally, the name \"Terra\" is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry \"Tellus\" has been used to denote personification of the Earth. \"Terra\" is also the name of the planet in some &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance languages&lt;/a&gt; (languages that evolved from &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;) like &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; \"Tierra\" and the &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; \"Terre\"). The Latinate form \"G\u00e6a\" or \"Gaea\" () of the Greek poetic name \"&lt;a href=\"Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;\" (; or ) is rare, though the alternative spelling \"Gaia\" has become common due to the &lt;a href=\"Gaia%20hypothesis\"&gt;Gaia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, in which case its pronunciation is rather than the more classical English .\nThere are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From \"Earth\" itself comes \"earthly\". From the Latin \"Terra\" comes \"terran\" , terrestrial , and (via French) \"terrene\" , and from the Latin \"Tellus\" comes \"tellurian\" and \"telluric\".\nChronology.\nFormation.\nThe oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to &lt;a href=\"Gigaannum\"&gt;Ga&lt;/a&gt; (billion years) ago. By the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in &lt;a href=\"Formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System\"&gt;the Solar System formed and evolved&lt;/a&gt; with the Sun. In theory, a &lt;a href=\"solar%20nebula\"&gt;solar nebula&lt;/a&gt; partitions a volume out of a &lt;a href=\"molecular%20cloud\"&gt;molecular cloud&lt;/a&gt; by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a &lt;a href=\"circumstellar%20disk\"&gt;circumstellar disk&lt;/a&gt;, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20dust\"&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"primordial%20nuclide\"&gt;primordial nuclide&lt;/a&gt;s). According to &lt;a href=\"nebular%20theory\"&gt;nebular theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planetesimal\"&gt;planetesimal&lt;/a&gt;s formed by &lt;a href=\"accretion%20%28astrophysics%29\"&gt;accretion&lt;/a&gt;, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.\nEstimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A &lt;a href=\"giant%20impact%20hypothesis\"&gt;leading hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named &lt;a href=\"Theia%20%28planet%29\"&gt;Theia&lt;/a&gt;, collided with Earth. It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous &lt;a href=\"Impact%20event\"&gt;asteroid impacts&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Heavy%20Bombardment\"&gt;Late Heavy Bombardment&lt;/a&gt; caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.\nGeological history.\n&lt;a href=\"Atmosphere%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Earth's atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s were formed by &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20activity\"&gt;volcanic activity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"outgassing\"&gt;outgassing&lt;/a&gt;. Water vapor from these sources &lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20water%20on%20Earth\"&gt;condensed&lt;/a&gt; into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, &lt;a href=\"protoplanet\"&gt;protoplanet&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"comet\"&gt;comet&lt;/a&gt;s. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas\"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt;es kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun &lt;a href=\"Faint%20young%20Sun%20paradox\"&gt;had only 70%&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href=\"solar%20luminosity\"&gt;current luminosity&lt;/a&gt;. By , &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field\"&gt;Earth's magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the &lt;a href=\"solar%20wind\"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it &lt;a href=\"Phase%20transition\"&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt; the first solid &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20crust\"&gt;crust&lt;/a&gt;, which is thought to have been &lt;a href=\"mafic\"&gt;mafic&lt;/a&gt; in composition. The first &lt;a href=\"continental%20crust\"&gt;continental crust&lt;/a&gt;, which was more &lt;a href=\"felsic\"&gt;felsic&lt;/a&gt; in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the &lt;a href=\"Hadean%20zircon\"&gt;mineral zircon of Hadean age&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eoarchean\"&gt;Eoarchean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/a&gt;s suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as , only after Earth's formation. There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the &lt;a href=\"Archean\"&gt;Archean&lt;/a&gt;, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from &lt;a href=\"hafnium\"&gt;hafnium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"zircon\"&gt;zircon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"neodymium\"&gt;neodymium&lt;/a&gt; in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale &lt;a href=\"crustal%20recycling\"&gt;recycling of the continental crust&lt;/a&gt;, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.\nNew continental crust forms as a result of &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;plate tectonics&lt;/a&gt;, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over &lt;a href=\"Geologic%20time%20scale\"&gt;the period&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form &lt;a href=\"supercontinent\"&gt;supercontinent&lt;/a&gt;s that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately , one of the earliest known supercontinents, &lt;a href=\"Rodinia\"&gt;Rodinia&lt;/a&gt;, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form &lt;a href=\"Pannotia\"&gt;Pannotia&lt;/a&gt; at , then finally &lt;a href=\"Pangaea\"&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt;, which also began to break apart at .\nThe most recent pattern of &lt;a href=\"ice%20age\"&gt;ice age&lt;/a&gt;s began about , and then intensified during the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; about . &lt;a href=\"High%20latitude\"&gt;High-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"middle%20latitude\"&gt;middle-latitude&lt;/a&gt; regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Glacial%20Period\"&gt;Last Glacial Period&lt;/a&gt;, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.\nOrigin of life and evolution.\n&lt;a href=\"Chemical%20reaction\"&gt;Chemical reaction&lt;/a&gt;s led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the &lt;a href=\"last%20universal%20common%20ancestor\"&gt;last common ancestor of all current life&lt;/a&gt; arose. The evolution of &lt;a href=\"photosynthesis\"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant &lt;a href=\"molecular%20oxygen\"&gt;molecular oxygen&lt;/a&gt; () accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective &lt;a href=\"ozone%20layer\"&gt;ozone layer&lt;/a&gt; () in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the &lt;a href=\"endosymbiotic%20theory\"&gt;development of complex cells&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"eukaryote\"&gt;eukaryote&lt;/a&gt;s. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within &lt;a href=\"Colony%20%28biology%29\"&gt;colonies&lt;/a&gt; became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet%20radiation\"&gt;ultraviolet radiation&lt;/a&gt; by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt; evidence for &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"microbial%20mat\"&gt;microbial mat&lt;/a&gt; fossils found in 3.48\u00a0billion-year-old &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biogenic%20substance\"&gt;biogenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graphite\"&gt;graphite&lt;/a&gt; found in 3.7\u00a0billion-year-old &lt;a href=\"metasediment\"&gt;metasediment&lt;/a&gt;ary rocks in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Greenland\"&gt;Western Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, and remains of &lt;a href=\"biotic%20material\"&gt;biotic material&lt;/a&gt; found in 4.1\u00a0billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. The &lt;a href=\"Earliest%20known%20life%20forms\"&gt;earliest direct evidence of life&lt;/a&gt; on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n rocks showing fossils of &lt;a href=\"microorganism\"&gt;microorganism&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Neoproterozoic\"&gt;Neoproterozoic&lt;/a&gt;, , much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"&lt;a href=\"Snowball%20Earth\"&gt;Snowball Earth&lt;/a&gt;\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the &lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20explosion\"&gt;Cambrian explosion&lt;/a&gt;, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion, , there have been at least five major &lt;a href=\"Extinction%20event\"&gt;mass extinctions&lt;/a&gt; and many minor ones. Apart from the proposed current &lt;a href=\"Holocene%20extinction\"&gt;Holocene extinction&lt;/a&gt; event, the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event\"&gt;most recent&lt;/a&gt; was , when &lt;a href=\"Chicxulub%20impactor\"&gt;an asteroid impact&lt;/a&gt; triggered the extinction of the non-avian &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past , and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Human%20evolution\"&gt;evolution of humans&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20agriculture\"&gt;development of agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ancient%20civilizations\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;, led to humans having an &lt;a href=\"Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment\"&gt;influence on Earth&lt;/a&gt; and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.\nFuture.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; () has a long lifespan in the atmosphere, moderate human emissions may postpone the next glacial inception by 100,000 years.\nEarth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next , solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the &lt;a href=\"carbonate%E2%80%93silicate%20cycle\"&gt;inorganic carbon cycle&lt;/a&gt;, reducing concentration to levels lethally low for plants ( for &lt;a href=\"C4%20carbon%20fixation\"&gt;C4 photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;) in approximately . The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible. Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a &lt;a href=\"runaway%20greenhouse%20effect\"&gt;runaway greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the &lt;a href=\"Mantle%20%28geology%29\"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt;, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.\nThe Sun will &lt;a href=\"stellar%20evolution\"&gt;evolve&lt;/a&gt; to become a &lt;a href=\"red%20giant\"&gt;red giant&lt;/a&gt; in about . Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly , about 250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSize and shape.\nThe shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and &lt;a href=\"equatorial%20bulge\"&gt;bulging&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20rotation\"&gt;Earth's rotation&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an &lt;a href=\"oblate%20spheroid\"&gt;oblate spheroid&lt;/a&gt;, whose equatorial diameter is larger than the &lt;a href=\"Geographical%20pole\"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;-to-pole diameter.\nThe average diameter of the reference spheroid is . Local &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Trench\"&gt;Mariana Trench&lt;/a&gt; ( below local sea level), whereas &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Everest\"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; ( above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%. The point on the surface farthest from Earth's &lt;a href=\"center%20of%20mass\"&gt;center of mass&lt;/a&gt; is the summit of the equatorial &lt;a href=\"Chimborazo%20%28volcano%29\"&gt;Chimborazo&lt;/a&gt; volcano in &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; ().\nIn &lt;a href=\"geodesy\"&gt;geodesy&lt;/a&gt;, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the &lt;a href=\"geoid\"&gt;geoid&lt;/a&gt;. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt; (MSL).\n&lt;a href=\"Sea%20surface%20topography\"&gt;Sea surface topography&lt;/a&gt; are water deviations from MSL, analogous to land topography.\nChemical composition.\n&lt;a href=\"Earth%20mass\"&gt;Earth's mass&lt;/a&gt; is approximately (5,970 &lt;a href=\"yottagram\"&gt;Yg&lt;/a&gt;). It is composed mostly of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; (32.1%), &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; (30.1%), &lt;a href=\"silicon\"&gt;silicon&lt;/a&gt; (15.1%), &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; (13.9%), &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; (2.9%), &lt;a href=\"nickel\"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt; (1.8%), &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; (1.5%), and &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to &lt;a href=\"mass%20segregation\"&gt;mass segregation&lt;/a&gt;, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.\nThe most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all &lt;a href=\"oxide\"&gt;oxide&lt;/a&gt;s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, &lt;a href=\"potash\"&gt;potash&lt;/a&gt;, and soda.\nInternal structure.\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their &lt;a href=\"chemical\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; or physical (&lt;a href=\"Rheology\"&gt;rheological&lt;/a&gt;) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct &lt;a href=\"Silicate%20minerals\"&gt;silicate&lt;/a&gt; solid crust, which is underlain by a highly &lt;a href=\"viscous\"&gt;viscous&lt;/a&gt; solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the &lt;a href=\"Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87%20discontinuity\"&gt;Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity&lt;/a&gt;. The thickness of the crust varies from about under the oceans to for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the &lt;a href=\"upper%20mantle\"&gt;upper mantle&lt;/a&gt; are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.\nBeneath the lithosphere is the &lt;a href=\"asthenosphere\"&gt;asthenosphere&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at below the surface, spanning a &lt;a href=\"Transition%20zone%20%28Earth%29\"&gt;transition zone&lt;/a&gt; that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid &lt;a href=\"outer%20core\"&gt;outer core&lt;/a&gt; lies above a solid &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20inner%20core\"&gt;inner core&lt;/a&gt;. Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher &lt;a href=\"angular%20velocity\"&gt;angular velocity&lt;/a&gt; than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1\u20130.5\u00b0 per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed. The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.\nDensity increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.\nHeat.\nThe major heat-producing &lt;a href=\"isotope\"&gt;isotope&lt;/a&gt;s within Earth are &lt;a href=\"potassium-40\"&gt;potassium-40&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"uranium-238\"&gt;uranium-238&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"thorium-232\"&gt;thorium-232&lt;/a&gt;. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach . Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of &lt;a href=\"mantle%20convection\"&gt;mantle convection&lt;/a&gt; and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon &lt;a href=\"igneous%20rock\"&gt;igneous rock&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"komatiite\"&gt;komatiite&lt;/a&gt;s that are rarely formed today.\nThe mean heat loss from Earth is , for a global heat loss of . A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by &lt;a href=\"mantle%20plume\"&gt;mantle plume&lt;/a&gt;s, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce &lt;a href=\"Hotspot%20%28geology%29\"&gt;hotspots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flood%20basalt\"&gt;flood basalt&lt;/a&gt;s. More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with &lt;a href=\"mid-ocean%20ridge\"&gt;mid-ocean ridge&lt;/a&gt;s. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.\nTectonic plates.\nEarth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at &lt;a href=\"Convergent%20boundary\"&gt;convergent boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, two plates come together; at &lt;a href=\"Divergent%20boundary\"&gt;divergent boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, two plates are pulled apart; and at &lt;a href=\"Transform%20boundary\"&gt;transform boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Volcanism\"&gt;volcanic activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orogeny\"&gt;mountain-building&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20trench\"&gt;oceanic trench&lt;/a&gt; formation can occur. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.\nAs the tectonic plates migrate, &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20crust\"&gt;oceanic crust&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Subduction\"&gt;subducted&lt;/a&gt; under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be old. By comparison, the oldest dated &lt;a href=\"continental%20crust\"&gt;continental crust&lt;/a&gt; is , although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to , indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.\nThe seven major plates are the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Plate\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Plate\"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Plate\"&gt;Eurasian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"African%20Plate\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antarctic%20Plate\"&gt;Antarctic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indo-Australian%20Plate\"&gt;Indo-Australian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20American%20Plate\"&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable plates include the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Plate\"&gt;Arabian Plate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Plate\"&gt;Caribbean Plate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nazca%20Plate\"&gt;Nazca Plate&lt;/a&gt; off the west coast of South America and the &lt;a href=\"Scotia%20Plate\"&gt;Scotia Plate&lt;/a&gt; in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between . The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the &lt;a href=\"Cocos%20Plate\"&gt;Cocos Plate&lt;/a&gt; advancing at a rate of and the Pacific Plate moving . At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of .\nSurface.\nThe total &lt;a href=\"Spheroid%23Area\"&gt;surface area&lt;/a&gt; of Earth is about . Of this, 70.8%, or , is below sea level and covered by ocean water. Below the ocean's surface are much of the &lt;a href=\"continental%20shelf\"&gt;continental shelf&lt;/a&gt;, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, &lt;a href=\"submarine%20canyon\"&gt;submarine canyon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20plateau\"&gt;oceanic plateau&lt;/a&gt;s, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. The remaining 29.2%, or , not covered by water has &lt;a href=\"terrain\"&gt;terrain&lt;/a&gt; that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other &lt;a href=\"landform\"&gt;landform&lt;/a&gt;s. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of at the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Sea\"&gt;Dead Sea&lt;/a&gt;, to a maximum altitude of at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about .\nThe continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;. Less common is &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and &lt;a href=\"Diagenesis\"&gt;compacted together&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is &lt;a href=\"metamorphic%20rock\"&gt;metamorphic rock&lt;/a&gt;, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant &lt;a href=\"silicate%20mineral\"&gt;silicate mineral&lt;/a&gt;s on Earth's surface include &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feldspar\"&gt;feldspar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"amphibole\"&gt;amphibole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mica\"&gt;mica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pyroxene\"&gt;pyroxene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"olivine\"&gt;olivine&lt;/a&gt;. Common &lt;a href=\"carbonate%20mineral\"&gt;carbonate mineral&lt;/a&gt;s include &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt; (found in &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Dolomite%20%28mineral%29\"&gt;dolomite&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Erosion%20and%20tectonics\"&gt;Erosion and tectonics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Types%20of%20volcanic%20eruptions\"&gt;volcanic eruptions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flooding\"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weathering\"&gt;weathering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glaciation\"&gt;glaciation&lt;/a&gt;, the growth of &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;s, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over &lt;a href=\"geological%20time\"&gt;geological time&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"pedosphere\"&gt;pedosphere&lt;/a&gt; is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to &lt;a href=\"pedogenesis\"&gt;soil formation processes&lt;/a&gt;. The total &lt;a href=\"arable%20land\"&gt;arable land&lt;/a&gt; is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated of cropland and of pastureland.\nGravitational field.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gravity%20of%20Earth\"&gt;gravity of Earth&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"acceleration\"&gt;acceleration&lt;/a&gt; that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, &lt;a href=\"gravitational%20acceleration\"&gt;gravitational acceleration&lt;/a&gt; is approximately . Local differences in topography, &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as &lt;a href=\"Gravity%20anomaly\"&gt;gravity anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagnetic field.\nThe main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a &lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20theory\"&gt;dynamo&lt;/a&gt; process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a &lt;a href=\"dipole\"&gt;dipole&lt;/a&gt;. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is , with a &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20dipole%20moment\"&gt;magnetic dipole moment&lt;/a&gt; of at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century. The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes &lt;a href=\"Geomagnetic%20secular%20variation\"&gt;secular variation&lt;/a&gt; of the main field and &lt;a href=\"geomagnetic%20reversal\"&gt;field reversals&lt;/a&gt; at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.\nMagnetosphere.\nThe extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the &lt;a href=\"magnetosphere\"&gt;magnetosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic &lt;a href=\"bow%20shock\"&gt;bow shock&lt;/a&gt; precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. &lt;a href=\"Charged%20particle\"&gt;Charged particle&lt;/a&gt;s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates. The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the &lt;a href=\"Van%20Allen%20radiation%20belt\"&gt;Van Allen radiation belt&lt;/a&gt;s are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20storm\"&gt;magnetic storm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"substorm\"&gt;substorm&lt;/a&gt;s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;aurora&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrbit and rotation.\nRotation.\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun\u2014its mean solar day\u2014is of mean solar time (). Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to &lt;a href=\"tidal%20acceleration\"&gt;tidal deceleration&lt;/a&gt;, each day varies between longer than the mean solar day.\nEarth's rotation period relative to the &lt;a href=\"fixed%20star\"&gt;fixed star&lt;/a&gt;s, called its \"stellar day\" by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Earth%20Rotation%20and%20Reference%20Systems%20Service\"&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service&lt;/a&gt; (IERS), is of mean solar time (&lt;a href=\"UT1\"&gt;UT1&lt;/a&gt;), or Earth's rotation period relative to the &lt;a href=\"precession%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;precessing&lt;/a&gt; or moving mean &lt;a href=\"March%20equinox\"&gt;March equinox&lt;/a&gt; (when the Sun is at 90\u00b0 on the equator), is of mean solar time (UT1) . Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4\u00a0ms.\nApart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15\u00b0/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the &lt;a href=\"celestial%20equator\"&gt;celestial equator&lt;/a&gt;, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.\nOrbit.\nEarth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one &lt;a href=\"sidereal%20year\"&gt;sidereal year&lt;/a&gt;. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1\u00b0/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12\u00a0hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24\u00a0hours\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Solar%20time\"&gt;solar day&lt;/a&gt;\u2014for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the &lt;a href=\"Meridian%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;meridian&lt;/a&gt;. The orbital speed of Earth averages about , which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about , in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, , in about 3.5 hours.\nThe Moon and Earth orbit a common &lt;a href=\"barycenter\"&gt;barycenter&lt;/a&gt; every 27.32\u00a0days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth-Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the &lt;a href=\"synodic%20month\"&gt;synodic month&lt;/a&gt;, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53\u00a0days. Viewed from the &lt;a href=\"celestial%20pole\"&gt;celestial north pole&lt;/a&gt;, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all &lt;a href=\"counterclockwise\"&gt;counterclockwise&lt;/a&gt;. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's &lt;a href=\"axial%20tilt\"&gt;axis is tilted&lt;/a&gt; some 23.44\u00a0degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the &lt;a href=\"ecliptic\"&gt;ecliptic&lt;/a&gt;), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to \u00b15.1\u00a0degrees against the Earth-Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between &lt;a href=\"lunar%20eclipse\"&gt;lunar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"solar%20eclipse\"&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hill%20sphere\"&gt;Hill sphere&lt;/a&gt;, or the sphere of &lt;a href=\"Gravity\"&gt;gravitational&lt;/a&gt; influence, of Earth is about in radius. This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.\nEarth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the &lt;a href=\"Milky%20Way\"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt; and orbits about 28,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"light-year\"&gt;light-year&lt;/a&gt;s from its center. It is about 20\u00a0light-years above the &lt;a href=\"galactic%20plane\"&gt;galactic plane&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Orion%20Arm\"&gt;Orion Arm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAxial tilt and seasons.\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0 with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Poles\"&gt;Celestial Poles&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with &lt;a href=\"summer\"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; occurring when the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Cancer\"&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; is facing the Sun, and in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Capricorn\"&gt;Tropic of Capricorn&lt;/a&gt; faces the Sun. In each instance, &lt;a href=\"winter\"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. Above the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Circle\"&gt;Arctic Circle&lt;/a&gt; and below the &lt;a href=\"Antarctic%20Circle\"&gt;Antarctic Circle&lt;/a&gt; there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a &lt;a href=\"polar%20night\"&gt;polar night&lt;/a&gt;, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a &lt;a href=\"midnight%20sun\"&gt;midnight sun&lt;/a&gt;, where the sun remains visible all day.\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the &lt;a href=\"equinox\"&gt;equinox&lt;/a&gt;es, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, &lt;a href=\"winter%20solstice\"&gt;winter solstice&lt;/a&gt; currently occurs around 21 December; &lt;a href=\"summer%20solstice\"&gt;summer solstice&lt;/a&gt; is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and &lt;a href=\"September%20equinox\"&gt;autumnal equinox&lt;/a&gt; is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo &lt;a href=\"nutation\"&gt;nutation&lt;/a&gt;; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6\u00a0years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, &lt;a href=\"axial%20precession\"&gt;precessing&lt;/a&gt; around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20year\"&gt;tropical year&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This &lt;a href=\"polar%20motion\"&gt;polar motion&lt;/a&gt; has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed &lt;a href=\"quasiperiodic%20motion\"&gt;quasiperiodic motion&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the &lt;a href=\"Chandler%20wobble\"&gt;Chandler wobble&lt;/a&gt;. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.\nIn modern times, Earth's &lt;a href=\"perihelion\"&gt;perihelion&lt;/a&gt; occurs around 3 January, and its &lt;a href=\"aphelion\"&gt;aphelion&lt;/a&gt; around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as &lt;a href=\"Milankovitch%20cycles\"&gt;Milankovitch cycles&lt;/a&gt;. The changing Earth-Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.\nEarth-Moon system.\nMoon.\nThe Moon is a relatively large, &lt;a href=\"Terrestrial%20planet\"&gt;terrestrial&lt;/a&gt;, planet-like &lt;a href=\"natural%20satellite\"&gt;natural satellite&lt;/a&gt;, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although &lt;a href=\"Charon%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; is larger relative to the &lt;a href=\"dwarf%20planet\"&gt;dwarf planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pluto\"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's. The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the &lt;a href=\"giant-impact%20hypothesis\"&gt;giant-impact hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes &lt;a href=\"tide\"&gt;tide&lt;/a&gt;s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its &lt;a href=\"tidal%20locking\"&gt;tidal locking&lt;/a&gt;: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the &lt;a href=\"lunar%20phase\"&gt;lunar phase&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately . Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Microsecond\"&gt;\u00b5s&lt;/a&gt;/yr\u2014add up to significant changes. During the &lt;a href=\"Ediacaran\"&gt;Ediacaran&lt;/a&gt; period, for example, (approximately ) there were 400\u00b17 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9\u00b10.4 hours.\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. &lt;a href=\"Paleontology\"&gt;Paleontological&lt;/a&gt; evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the &lt;a href=\"torque\"&gt;torque&lt;/a&gt;s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The &lt;a href=\"angular%20size\"&gt;angular size&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"solid%20angle\"&gt;solid angle&lt;/a&gt;) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\nAsteroids and artificial satellites.\nEarth's &lt;a href=\"Co-orbital%20configuration\"&gt;co-orbital asteroids&lt;/a&gt; population consists of &lt;a href=\"quasi-satellite\"&gt;quasi-satellite&lt;/a&gt;s, objects with a &lt;a href=\"horseshoe%20orbit\"&gt;horseshoe orbit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20%28celestial%20body%29\"&gt;trojans&lt;/a&gt;. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including &lt;a href=\"469219%20Kamo%CA%BBoalewa\"&gt;469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Earth%20trojan\"&gt;trojan asteroid&lt;/a&gt; companion, , is &lt;a href=\"Libration\"&gt;librating&lt;/a&gt; around the leading &lt;a href=\"Lagrangian%20point\"&gt;Lagrange triangular point&lt;/a&gt;, L4, in &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20orbit\"&gt;Earth's orbit&lt;/a&gt; around the Sun. The tiny &lt;a href=\"near-Earth%20asteroid\"&gt;near-Earth asteroid&lt;/a&gt; makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.\n, there are 4,550 operational, human-made &lt;a href=\"satellite\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt;s orbiting Earth. There are also inoperative satellites, including &lt;a href=\"Vanguard%201\"&gt;Vanguard 1&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked &lt;a href=\"space%20debris\"&gt;space debris&lt;/a&gt;. Earth's largest artificial satellite is the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nHydrosphere.\nEarth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of . The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35\u00a0&lt;a href=\"metric%20ton\"&gt;metric ton&lt;/a&gt;s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of with a mean depth of , resulting in an estimated volume of . If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be . About 97.5% of the water is &lt;a href=\"saline%20water\"&gt;saline&lt;/a&gt;; the remaining 2.5% is &lt;a href=\"fresh%20water\"&gt;fresh water&lt;/a&gt;. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in &lt;a href=\"ice%20cap\"&gt;ice cap&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20formation\"&gt;changes into ice&lt;/a&gt;. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20glaciers\"&gt;Alpine glaciers&lt;/a&gt; form in mountainous areas, whereas vast &lt;a href=\"ice%20sheets\"&gt;ice sheets&lt;/a&gt; form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of &lt;a href=\"U-shaped%20valley\"&gt;U-shaped valley&lt;/a&gt;s and other landforms. &lt;a href=\"Sea%20ice\"&gt;Sea ice&lt;/a&gt; in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.\nThe average &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt; of Earth's oceans is about 35\u00a0grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt). Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large &lt;a href=\"heat%20reservoir\"&gt;heat reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the &lt;a href=\"El%20Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern%20Oscillation\"&gt;El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe abundance of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt;. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water. Despite some &lt;a href=\"Natural%20satellite\"&gt;moons&lt;/a&gt; showing signs of large reservoirs of &lt;a href=\"extraterrestrial%20liquid%20water\"&gt;extraterrestrial liquid water&lt;/a&gt;, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20lakes%20and%20seas%20in%20the%20Solar%20System\"&gt;large bodies of water&lt;/a&gt; under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.\nAtmosphere.\nThe &lt;a href=\"atmospheric%20pressure\"&gt;atmospheric pressure&lt;/a&gt; at Earth's &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; averages , with a &lt;a href=\"scale%20height\"&gt;scale height&lt;/a&gt; of about . A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% &lt;a href=\"argon\"&gt;argon&lt;/a&gt;, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. &lt;a href=\"Water%20vapor\"&gt;Water vapor&lt;/a&gt; content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%. The height of the &lt;a href=\"troposphere\"&gt;troposphere&lt;/a&gt; varies with latitude, ranging between at the poles to at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.\nEarth's &lt;a href=\"biosphere\"&gt;biosphere&lt;/a&gt; has significantly altered its &lt;a href=\"Atmosphere%20of%20Earth\"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oxygen%20evolution%23Oxygen%20evolution%20in%20nature\"&gt;Oxygenic photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; evolved , &lt;a href=\"oxygen%20catastrophe\"&gt;forming&lt;/a&gt; the primarily nitrogen\u2013oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled the proliferation of &lt;a href=\"aerobic%20organisms\"&gt;aerobic organisms&lt;/a&gt; and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Ozone%E2%80%93oxygen%20cycle\"&gt;conversion of atmospheric into&lt;/a&gt;. The ozone layer blocks &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet\"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"solar%20radiation\"&gt;solar radiation&lt;/a&gt;, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small &lt;a href=\"meteor\"&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt;s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20effect\"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture &lt;a href=\"thermal%20energy\"&gt;thermal energy&lt;/a&gt; emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, &lt;a href=\"methane\"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nitrous%20oxide\"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ozone\"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt; are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be , in contrast to the current , and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.\nWeather and climate.\nEarth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is &lt;a href=\"atmospheric%20circulation\"&gt;atmospheric circulation&lt;/a&gt; that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the &lt;a href=\"trade%20winds\"&gt;trade winds&lt;/a&gt; in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the &lt;a href=\"westerlies\"&gt;westerlies&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20current\"&gt;Ocean current&lt;/a&gt;s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the &lt;a href=\"thermohaline%20circulation\"&gt;thermohaline circulation&lt;/a&gt; that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.\nEarth receives 1361\u00a0W/m2 of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"solar%20irradiance\"&gt;solar irradiance&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the &lt;a href=\"Tropics\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; (or equatorial), &lt;a href=\"Subtropics\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polar%20region\"&gt;polar&lt;/a&gt; climates.\nFurther factors that affect a location's climates are its &lt;a href=\"Continentality\"&gt;proximity to oceans&lt;/a&gt;, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology. Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the &lt;a href=\"ocean%20heat%20content\"&gt;heat of the ocean&lt;/a&gt; to the land. Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20DC\"&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt; are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. Finally, temperatures &lt;a href=\"Lapse%20rate\"&gt;decrease with height&lt;/a&gt; causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.\nThe commonly used &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; system has five broad groups (&lt;a href=\"tropical%20climate\"&gt;humid tropics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arid\"&gt;arid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid middle latitudes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Continental%20climate\"&gt;continental&lt;/a&gt; and cold &lt;a href=\"polar%20climate\"&gt;polar&lt;/a&gt;), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The K\u00f6ppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation. Surface &lt;a href=\"Highest%20temperature%20recorded%20on%20Earth\"&gt;air temperature can rise to&lt;/a&gt; around in &lt;a href=\"hot%20desert\"&gt;hot desert&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Valley%20National%20Park\"&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lowest%20temperature%20recorded%20on%20Earth\"&gt;can fall as low as&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpper atmosphere.\nAbove the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the &lt;a href=\"stratosphere\"&gt;stratosphere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mesosphere\"&gt;mesosphere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"thermosphere\"&gt;thermosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the &lt;a href=\"exosphere\"&gt;exosphere&lt;/a&gt; thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n%20line\"&gt;K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line&lt;/a&gt;, defined as above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and &lt;a href=\"outer%20space\"&gt;outer space&lt;/a&gt;.\nThermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady &lt;a href=\"Atmospheric%20escape\"&gt;loss of the atmosphere into space&lt;/a&gt;. Because unfixed &lt;a href=\"hydrogen\"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; has a low &lt;a href=\"molecular%20mass\"&gt;molecular mass&lt;/a&gt;, it can achieve &lt;a href=\"escape%20velocity\"&gt;escape velocity&lt;/a&gt; more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially &lt;a href=\"redox\"&gt;reducing&lt;/a&gt; state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\nLife on Earth.\nA planet's life forms inhabit &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;s, whose total forms the &lt;a href=\"biosphere\"&gt;biosphere&lt;/a&gt;. The biosphere is divided into a number of &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;height above sea level&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt;. Terrestrial &lt;a href=\"tundra\"&gt;biomes&lt;/a&gt; lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20tundra\"&gt;high altitudes&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;extremely arid areas&lt;/a&gt; are relatively barren of plant and animal life; &lt;a href=\"Latitudinal%20gradients%20in%20species%20diversity\"&gt;species diversity&lt;/a&gt; reaches a peak in &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes&lt;/a&gt;. Estimates of the &lt;a href=\"number%20of%20species\"&gt;number of species&lt;/a&gt; on Earth today vary; most species have not been &lt;a href=\"Species%20description\"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt;. Over 99% of all &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; that ever lived on Earth are &lt;a href=\"extinct\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt;.\nA planet that can sustain life is termed &lt;a href=\"Planetary%20habitability\"&gt;habitable&lt;/a&gt;, even if life did not originate there. The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface. Earth provides liquid water\u2014an environment where complex &lt;a href=\"Organic%20compound\"&gt;organic molecules&lt;/a&gt; can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. Plants can take up &lt;a href=\"nutrient\"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;s from the atmosphere, soils and water. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.\nExtreme weather, such as &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone\"&gt;tropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"hurricane\"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"typhoon\"&gt;typhoon&lt;/a&gt;s), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, &lt;a href=\"landslide\"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tsunami\"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;s, volcanic eruptions, &lt;a href=\"tornado\"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"blizzard\"&gt;blizzard&lt;/a&gt;s, floods, droughts, &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt;s, and other calamities and disasters. Human impact is felt in many areas due to &lt;a href=\"pollution\"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; of the air and water, &lt;a href=\"acid%20rain\"&gt;acid rain&lt;/a&gt;, loss of vegetation (&lt;a href=\"overgrazing\"&gt;overgrazing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deforestation\"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"desertification\"&gt;desertification&lt;/a&gt;), loss of wildlife, species &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soil%20degradation\"&gt;soil degradation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soil%20depletion\"&gt;soil depletion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;. Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause &lt;a href=\"global%20warming\"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. This is driving &lt;a href=\"Effects%20of%20climate%20change\"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850\"&gt;melting of glaciers and ice sheets&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20level%20rise\"&gt;global rise in average sea levels&lt;/a&gt;, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.\nHuman geography.\n&lt;a href=\"world%20population\"&gt;Earth's human population&lt;/a&gt; passed seven billion in the early 2010s, and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century. Most of the growth is expected to take place in &lt;a href=\"sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Population%20density%23Human%20population%20density\"&gt;Human population density&lt;/a&gt; varies widely around the world, but a majority live in &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. By 2050, 68% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas. The Northern Hemisphere contains 68% of the world's land mass. Partly due to the predominance of land mass, 90% of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIt is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on\u2014three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert (14%), high mountains (27%), or other unsuitable terrains. &lt;a href=\"State%20%28polity%29\"&gt;States&lt;/a&gt; claim the planet's entire land surface, except for parts of Antarctica and a few other &lt;a href=\"Terra%20nullius\"&gt;unclaimed areas&lt;/a&gt;. Earth has never had a planetwide government, but the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is the leading worldwide &lt;a href=\"intergovernmental%20organization\"&gt;intergovernmental organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first human to orbit Earth was &lt;a href=\"Yuri%20Gagarin\"&gt;Yuri Gagarin&lt;/a&gt; on 12 April 1961. In total, about 550 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, &lt;a href=\"Apollo%20program\"&gt;twelve&lt;/a&gt; have walked on the Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20International%20Space%20Station%20expeditions\"&gt;crew&lt;/a&gt;, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is , achieved during the &lt;a href=\"Apollo%2013\"&gt;Apollo 13&lt;/a&gt; mission in 1970.\nNatural resources and land use.\nEarth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed &lt;a href=\"non-renewable%20resource\"&gt;non-renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"fossil%20fuel\"&gt;fossil fuel&lt;/a&gt;s, are only replenished over geological timescales. Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of &lt;a href=\"ore%20genesis\"&gt;ore genesis&lt;/a&gt;, resulting from actions of &lt;a href=\"magmatism\"&gt;magmatism&lt;/a&gt;, erosion, and plate tectonics. These &lt;a href=\"metal\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;s and other elements are extracted by &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.\nEarth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pharmaceutical\"&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt;s, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon &lt;a href=\"topsoil\"&gt;topsoil&lt;/a&gt; and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land. In 2019, of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, was shrub and grassland, were used for animal feed production and grazing, and were cultivated as croplands. Of the 1214% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 &lt;a href=\"percentage%20point\"&gt;percentage point&lt;/a&gt;s were irrigated in 2015. Humans use &lt;a href=\"building%20material\"&gt;building material&lt;/a&gt;s to construct shelters.\nHumans and environment.\nHuman activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas\"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt;es in the atmosphere, altering &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20energy%20budget\"&gt;Earth's energy budget&lt;/a&gt; and climate. It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were warmer than the preindustrial baseline. This increase in temperature, known as &lt;a href=\"global%20warming\"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;, has contributed to the &lt;a href=\"Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850\"&gt;melting of glaciers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sea%20level%20rise\"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.\nThe concept of &lt;a href=\"planetary%20boundaries\"&gt;planetary boundaries&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to quantify humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: &lt;a href=\"Biodiversity%20loss\"&gt;Biosphere integrity&lt;/a&gt;, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold. As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is though possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.\nCultural and historical viewpoint.\n&lt;a href=\"Culture\"&gt;Human cultures&lt;/a&gt; have developed many views of the planet. The standard &lt;a href=\"Astronomical%20symbols\"&gt;astronomical symbol&lt;/a&gt; of Earth consists of a cross &lt;a href=\"circumscribed%20circle\"&gt;circumscribed by a circle&lt;/a&gt;, , representing the &lt;a href=\"four%20corners%20of%20the%20world\"&gt;four corners of the world&lt;/a&gt;. (See also &lt;a href=\"Earth%20symbol\"&gt;Earth symbol&lt;/a&gt;.) Earth is sometimes &lt;a href=\"Personification\"&gt;personified&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;. In many cultures it is a &lt;a href=\"mother%20goddess\"&gt;mother goddess&lt;/a&gt; that is also the primary &lt;a href=\"fertility%20deity\"&gt;fertility deity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Creation%20myth\"&gt;Creation myth&lt;/a&gt;s in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. The &lt;a href=\"Gaia%20hypothesis\"&gt;Gaia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20of%20first%20images%20of%20Earth%20from%20space\"&gt;Images of Earth taken from space&lt;/a&gt;, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the &lt;a href=\"overview%20effect\"&gt;overview effect&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility. \nParticularly causing a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly &lt;a href=\"Earth%20observation\"&gt;Earth observation&lt;/a&gt;, humans have started to take &lt;a href=\"Environmentalism\"&gt;action on environmental issues&lt;/a&gt; globally, acknowledging the impact of humans and the &lt;a href=\"Ecological%20network\"&gt;interconnectedness of Earth's environments&lt;/a&gt;.\nScientific investigation has been resulting in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a &lt;a href=\"flat%20Earth\"&gt;flat Earth&lt;/a&gt; was gradually displaced in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt; by the idea of a &lt;a href=\"spherical%20Earth\"&gt;spherical Earth&lt;/a&gt;, which was attributed to both the philosophers &lt;a href=\"Pythagoras\"&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parmenides\"&gt;Parmenides&lt;/a&gt;. Earth was generally believed to be &lt;a href=\"Geocentric%20model\"&gt;the center of the universe&lt;/a&gt; until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was &lt;a href=\"heliocentrism\"&gt;a moving object&lt;/a&gt;, one of the planets of the Solar System.\nIt was only during the 19th century that geologists realized &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20age\"&gt;Earth's age&lt;/a&gt; was at least many millions of years. &lt;a href=\"William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin\"&gt;Lord Kelvin&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"thermodynamics\"&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400\u00a0million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and &lt;a href=\"Radiometric%20dating\"&gt;radioactive dating&lt;/a&gt; were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.\nNotes.\n&lt;/math&gt;, where \"m\" is the mass of Earth, \"a\" is an astronomical unit, and \"M\" is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about formula_1.&lt;/ref&gt;"
