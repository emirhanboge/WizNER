    "text": "XIII (Thirteen) is a &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novel\"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book%20series\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about an &lt;a href=\"amnesia\"&gt;amnesia&lt;/a&gt;c who seeks to discover his past. It was created by writer &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Van%20Hamme\"&gt;Jean Van Hamme&lt;/a&gt; and artist &lt;a href=\"William%20Vance\"&gt;William Vance&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently being written by &lt;a href=\"Yves%20Sente\"&gt;Yves Sente&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Youri%20Jigounov\"&gt;Youri Jigounov&lt;/a&gt;. The storyline of the first five volumes was adapted into a &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, also titled \"&lt;a href=\"XIII%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;XIII&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released on several platforms. A &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"television%20film\"&gt;television film&lt;/a&gt; based on the series, ', was released in 2008. It was followed in 2011 by two seasons of a TV series, each 13 episodes, called '.\nVolumes 1-5.\nThe series begins with a &lt;a href=\"amnesia\"&gt;amnesiac&lt;/a&gt; man awakening to find himself washed ashore in the eastern US. The only clues to his past are a tattoo of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20numerals\"&gt;Roman numerals&lt;/a&gt; \"XIII\" on his collarbone and a photo of himself with a woman, who is identified as Kim Rowland, widow of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; captain Steve Rowland. Volumes 1 through 5 deal with \"XIII\" searching for his identity and past. He finds himself hunted by a contract killer, the \"Mongoose\", who works for a mysterious organization known as &lt;a href=\"XX%20%28organization%29\"&gt;XX&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to mount a &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"US%20government\"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;. XIII is rescued from XX's assassins by Colonel Amos of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who confronts XIII with video evidence that shows XIII assassinating the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the second volume, XIII is captured by General Carrington and his aide, Lieutenant Jones. Carrington confirms that XIII is Rowland, and further explains that Rowland was a member of a &lt;a href=\"special%20operations\"&gt;special operations&lt;/a&gt; unit called Special Assault and Destroying Sections (SPADS). Carrington had been commander of SPADS when Rowland was supposedly &lt;a href=\"killed%20in%20action\"&gt;killed in action&lt;/a&gt; two years earlier. Because XIII's amnesia prevents him from identifying who sponsored the President's assassination, Amos lets him go. XIII reunites with his father and his uncle, but they are both murdered by XIII's young, gold-digging stepmother Felicity, who frames him after harming herself. XIII escapes the police with Carrington's help and meets Kim, an XX member known as \"XVII\", who reveals that XIII is not Steve Rowland. XIII is arrested by the police and Kim disappears. XIII is found guilty for the murders and sent to a maximum security prison.\nThe third volume finds Amos, still pursuing his investigation, realizing that XIII was a &lt;a href=\"body%20double\"&gt;body double&lt;/a&gt; for the real Steve Rowland. Amos requests Carrington's help to identify people who have been trained as top-level special operators and match XIII's physique; Amos's aim is to discover XIII's true identity. Carrington provides the papers of about twenty people. One, named Ross Tanner, has been missing for two years. Amos decides to leave XIII in prison to have his amnesia treated. The treatment fails, and the Mongoose tries to have XIII killed in the prison. Carrington helps XIII break out.\nVolume four begins with Amos finding that Carrington had invented the Tanner identity and suspecting him of being part of the conspiracy to kill the President. XIII, under the name of Ross Tanner, has been hidden by Carrington in a SPADS training facility in the fictitious &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n country of San Miguel. Amos continues to delve into the files and learns that Rowland was murdered shortly after the assassination. Amos now assumes that Rowland was the real assassin, and is confused about XIII's real role, but he exposes Judge Allenby, the head of the investigation, as one of the conspirators. Amos interrogates Allenby, who is killed by the Mongoose's assassin; Amos himself is rescued by Kim. Meanwhile, a female SPADS Sergeant named Betty Barnowsky reveals to XIII that she saw Rowland in Eastown after his alleged death, in the company with SPADS Colonel Seymour McCall. XIII, Barnowsky, and Jones escape an assassination attempt by McCall but end up lost in the San Miguel jungle.\nKim takes Amos to Carrington and &lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20National%20Intelligence\"&gt;National Intelligence Director&lt;/a&gt; Carl Heideger, who reveal that, after faking his death in the helicopter crash, Rowland contacted Kim and forced her to be a member of the conspiracy. Kim, not sharing the conspiracy's ideology, and herself a former secret agent, secretly alerted her former boss, Heideger. Despite having this information, however, Heideger was unable to prevent the assassination of the President. Rowland was shot by the Mongoose, but he escaped, mortally wounded, and died shortly after telling Kim what had happened. Heideger and Carrington then came up with a plan to make XX believe that Rowland had survived, hoping to attract the Mongoose's killers, arrest them, and follow their trail to the conspirators. They sourced a man named Jason Fly who was transformed into a Rowland double, but soon after, Fly disappeared, when he was shot and lost his memory, just before the story began. Kim is also revealed to be Carrington's daughter.\nAt the start of volume five, XIII, Jones, and Barnowsky kidnap the Marquis de Pr\u00e9seau, a rich French land owner in San Miguel, to steal his jet to fly back to the US. Meanwhile, Carrington and Heideger have been arrested by the conspirators as they prepare to take over the country during a large-scale &lt;a href=\"military%20exercise\"&gt;military exercise&lt;/a&gt;. XIII and the women meet with Amos, who brings them into contact with Walter Sheridan, brother of the assassinated President and himself a candidate for presidency.\nSheridan helps XIII infiltrate the military's center of operations, and, together with President Galbrain, manage to stop the conspiracy at the last moment. The entire conspiracy group, with the exception of the illustrious Number I, has been either killed or captured. Walter is elected President, and Kim remains missing for reasons unknown. At the end of the story, XIII believes he has found his old identity as Jason Fly and is prepared to continue his life normally, even if his memories have not yet returned.\nVolumes 6-8.\nIn the following volumes, XIII takes up the investigation about his past. Volumes six and seven bring XIII to Greenfalls, a snowy town in the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountains\"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the story revolves around the fate of his father in the &lt;a href=\"McCarthyism\"&gt;McCarthian&lt;/a&gt; 1950s. XIII learns that his father, Jonathan Fly, was murdered by the local &lt;a href=\"Ku%20Klux%20Klan\"&gt;Klansmen&lt;/a&gt; after they found out Fly's real identity was Jonathan McClane, a \"&lt;a href=\"Communism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;\" journalist who had to flee after suffering under McCarthy's witch hunt. The Mongoose still tracks XIII with the blessing of McClane's assassins, but XIII evades the manhunt, gets justice for the murder of his father and manages to arrest the Mongoose, who reveals that he was on Number I's boat when he shot the bullet that made XIII amnesic, but divulges no further information about Number I. The story ends with XIII finally finding his true identity as Jason McClane.\nIn volume eight, XIII is approached by President Sheridan to become a special agent and is charged with finding Number I. The Mongoose escapes from custody. XIII tracks down Kim, guessing that she stayed in hiding because she knows Number I's identity. He discovers that one of the boats close to the spot where he was found amnesic is Sheridan's &lt;a href=\"yacht\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Jones investigates further and discovers that Kim had a &lt;a href=\"legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29\"&gt;love child&lt;/a&gt; with Sheridan. After passing on this information to XIII, they become convinced that Sheridan was in fact Number I, and used the XX to have his brother killed and propel himself to the Presidency. Sheridan had the child kidnapped to force Kim to marry Rowland, to betray Jason when Heideger's plan threatened to expose him as Number I, and have him lured onto his yacht where XIII was shot by the Mongoose. After trying to release Kim from an island where they believe she is sequestered, XIII and Jones, along with Kim, are caught by the Mongoose, who sinks Sheridan's yacht with an explosive. XIII only manages to rescue Jones, and Kim is presumed dead.\nXIII finally faces Sheridan, who has been exposed as Number I. XIII has no evidence or witness against him, however. Sheridan does not assassinate XIII to avoid a new investigation that might expose him, and XIII and Jones leave the country.\nVolumes 9-13.\nIn the following volumes, the action takes place in and around Costa Verde, a small fictional nation in &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; where XIII is led to believe he once led a revolution under the identity of \"El Cascador\", although El Cascador is supposedly dead. XIII gets involved with revolutionary Maria de los Santos, who claims to have been his wife. In the tenth volume, after freeing her from a prison from which she was awaiting execution, she confirms that he is her husband.\nDuring the revolution, XIII meets an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Americans\"&gt;Irish-American&lt;/a&gt; expat, Sean Mullway, who claims to be XIII's real father and confirms that XIII is Jason McClane. The history of XIII's Irish descent is revealed, and XIII learns that his mother was the sister of &lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20the%20National%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;NSA Director&lt;/a&gt; Giordino, who accidentally murdered her. The Giordinos are revealed to be a &lt;a href=\"American%20Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; family. At the end of the volume, XIII is offered &lt;a href=\"amnesty\"&gt;amnesty&lt;/a&gt; by the US ambassador, who explains that XIII's help is needed; Carrington has apparently gone insane.\nIn volume twelve, the corrupt President Sheridan is kidnapped by Carrington, who has learned that Sheridan ordered his daughter Kim's death. Carrington and Amos have XIII and Jones capture the Mongoose to get further evidence against Sheridan. In a televised \"trial\", Sheridan is revealed to the American public as Number I, with XIII and the Mongoose testifying. In the aftermath of the event, Sheridan kills the Mongoose, and Giordino accidentally kills Sheridan.\nVolume thirteen, \"The XIII Mystery: The Investigation\", is a special issue, where two journalists retrace the first twelve issues, clarifying and expanding the storyline.\nVolumes 14-20.\nWhile in exile in Costa Verde, XIII and Mullway attempt to find a treasure hidden by their ancestors somewhere in Mexico. Giordino, meanwhile, fabricates evidence claiming that XIII is Seamus O'Neill, an &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; operative who trained under &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;. As O'Neill, XIII is wanted by the US government, but he again manages to escape. He also survives an assassination attempt by Irina Svetlanova, who has taken over the Mongoose's operation. After many setbacks, the treasure is found and then lost again. Meanwhile, Giordino is removed from duty by the new President, who has received evidence from XIII and Mullway revealing that Giordino is not only connected to the Mafia but also that he killed Sheridan.\nVolumes eighteen and nineteen are the last written by Van Hamme. Volume eighteen, \"The Irish Version\", was drawn by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Giraud\"&gt;Jean Giraud&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;a href=\"M%C5%93bius\"&gt;M\u0153bius&lt;/a&gt;. It features as a story within the story, and it is referred to as part of the plot along with \"The XIII Mystery\" in volume nineteen \"The Last Round\". This is the prequel to the initial story arc, and it resolves all mysteries surrounding XIII's identity.\nXIII has learned his identity, but his memories still have not returned. He seeks medical treatment to uncover them in volume twenty, but \"Mayflower Day\", a secret organization, schemes to keep XIII from unblocking his memory, because of yet another secret in his past.\nPopularity.\n\"XIII\" was released in 1984 as a serial in the popular \"&lt;a href=\"Spirou%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spirou&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, and it was popular among Spirou readers.
