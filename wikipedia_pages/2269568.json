    "text": "A rainband is a &lt;a href=\"cloud\"&gt;cloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;precipitation&lt;/a&gt; structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated. Rainbands can be &lt;a href=\"Nimbostratus%20cloud\"&gt;stratiform&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"atmospheric%20convection\"&gt;convective&lt;/a&gt;, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on &lt;a href=\"weather%20radar\"&gt;weather radar&lt;/a&gt; imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Rainbands of &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20cyclone\"&gt;tropical cyclones&lt;/a&gt; contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28cyclone%29\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt;, constitute a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone\"&gt;hurricane or tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.\nRainbands spawned near and ahead of &lt;a href=\"cold%20front\"&gt;cold front&lt;/a&gt;s can be &lt;a href=\"squall%20line\"&gt;squall line&lt;/a&gt;s which are able to produce &lt;a href=\"tornado\"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt;es. Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level &lt;a href=\"barrier%20jet\"&gt;barrier jet&lt;/a&gt;. Bands of thunderstorms can form with &lt;a href=\"sea%20breeze\"&gt;sea breeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"land%20breeze\"&gt;land breeze&lt;/a&gt; boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an &lt;a href=\"extratropical%20cyclone\"&gt;extratropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt; can yield significant amounts of &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. If the atmosphere is cold enough, these rainbands can yield heavy &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtratropical cyclones.\nRainbands in advance of warm &lt;a href=\"occluded%20front\"&gt;occluded front&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warm%20front\"&gt;warm front&lt;/a&gt;s are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical &lt;a href=\"wind%20shear\"&gt;wind shear&lt;/a&gt;, narrow, convective rainbands known as &lt;a href=\"squall%20line\"&gt;squall line&lt;/a&gt;s form generally in the &lt;a href=\"cyclone\"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt;'s warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts, which tend to have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center, in colder cyclones, &lt;a href=\"microscale%20meteorology\"&gt;small scale&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mesoscale%20meteorology\"&gt;mesoscale&lt;/a&gt;, bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of to . These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. Southwest of &lt;a href=\"Extratropical%20cyclone\"&gt;extratropical cyclones&lt;/a&gt;, curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; can lead to narrow &lt;a href=\"lake-effect%20snow\"&gt;lake-effect snow&lt;/a&gt; bands which bring significant localized snowfall.\nTropical cyclones.\nRainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones, which point towards the cyclone's center of &lt;a href=\"low%20pressure%20area\"&gt;low pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air. Bands located to from a cyclone's center migrate outward. They are capable of producing heavy &lt;a href=\"Rain\"&gt;rains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squall\"&gt;squall&lt;/a&gt;s of wind, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;tornadoes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the storm's right-front quadrant.\nSome rainbands move closer to the center, forming a secondary, or outer, &lt;a href=\"eyewall\"&gt;eyewall&lt;/a&gt; within intense hurricanes. Spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most &lt;a href=\"tropical%20cyclone%20basins\"&gt;tropical cyclone basins&lt;/a&gt;, use of the satellite-based &lt;a href=\"Dvorak%20technique\"&gt;Dvorak technique&lt;/a&gt; is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's &lt;a href=\"maximum%20sustained%20wind\"&gt;maximum sustained wind&lt;/a&gt;s. Within this method, the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28cyclone%29\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. &lt;a href=\"Atmospheric%20pressure\"&gt;Central pressure&lt;/a&gt; values for their centers of &lt;a href=\"low%20pressure\"&gt;low pressure&lt;/a&gt; derived from this technique are approximate.\nDifferent programs have been studying these rainbands, including &lt;a href=\"the%20Hurricane%20Rainband%20and%20Intensity%20Change%20Experiment\"&gt;the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nForced by geography.\nConvective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its &lt;a href=\"windward\"&gt;windward&lt;/a&gt; side, due to &lt;a href=\"lee%20wave\"&gt;lee wave&lt;/a&gt;s triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. Their spacing is normally to apart. When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography, a low-level barrier &lt;a href=\"jet%20stream\"&gt;jet stream&lt;/a&gt; forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge, which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, &lt;a href=\"sea%20breeze\"&gt;sea breeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"land%20breeze\"&gt;land breeze&lt;/a&gt; fronts can form convective rainbands. Sea breeze front &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening. The edge of &lt;a href=\"ocean%20currents\"&gt;ocean currents&lt;/a&gt; can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts."
