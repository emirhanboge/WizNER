    "text": "Michael Rowbotham is a political and economic writer and commentator based in the UK who is primarily known for his two books, \"The Grip of Death: A Study of Modern Money, Debt Slavery, and Destructive Economics\" (1998) and \"Goodbye America\" (2000).\n\"The Grip of Death\".\n\"The Grip of Death: A Study of Modern Money, Debt Slavery, and Destructive Economics\" focuses on what he believes to be inequities in the practice of &lt;a href=\"fractional-reserve%20banking\"&gt;fractional-reserve banking&lt;/a&gt; (which he equates with &lt;a href=\"counterfeit\"&gt;counterfeit&lt;/a&gt;ing) and the economic distortions he believes to be inherent in the so-called &lt;a href=\"debt-based%20monetary%20system\"&gt;debt-based monetary system&lt;/a&gt; which almost all nations use in the modern age. In \"Goodbye America\", Rowbotham argues that Third World debt is immoral, invalid, and inherently unrepayable."
