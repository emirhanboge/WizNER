However, the UNSA is not strongly implanted everywhere in France, and received most votes from the white-collar workers and the engineers.\nThe UNSA challenges the entrenched leadership of the reformist unions: the CFDT, CFTC and CFE-CGC, though the UNSA often co-operates with these unions.\nProfessional elections.\nThe UNSA won 6.25% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, its best result to date. It had won 4.99% in 2002."
