    "text": "The Inselspital, also named the University Hospital of Bern (German: \"Universit\u00e4tsspital Bern\"), located in &lt;a href=\"Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the five &lt;a href=\"university%20hospital\"&gt;university hospital&lt;/a&gt;s of Switzerland. It is associated with the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bern\"&gt;University of Bern&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hospital is operated by a charitable foundation established in 1354 through the will of Anna Seiler, a wealthy Bernese. It acquired its current name in 1531 when it occupied the buildings of the \"St. Michaels Insel\" convent. From 1841 on, it has participated in the training of medical students.\nThe hospital moved to its present location in 1885. Many of the historic buildings were demolished from 1958 to 1978 and replaced by modern infrastructure, including a high-rise patient building.\nAs of 2016, the hospital employs a staff of 7,255 and provides care for 250,000 patients each year. It also provides practical training to 600 medical students and over 1,000 other healthcare professionals.\nThe prominent physicians who have practiced in the Inselspital include &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Theodor%20Kocher\"&gt;Emil Theodor Kocher&lt;/a&gt;, the 1909 &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20laureate\"&gt;Nobel laureate&lt;/a&gt;."
