    "text": "\"Newport\"-class tank landing ships were an improved class of &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank\"&gt;tank landing ship&lt;/a&gt; (LST) designed for and employed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; from 1969 to 2002. The ships were intended to provide substantial advantages over their &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;-era predecessors. Larger and faster than any previous LST design, they carried a ramp over the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to surpass , a goal of the United States &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20warfare\"&gt;amphibious forces&lt;/a&gt;. 27 were planned of which twenty were completed, the high number due to the demands of US force projection estimates. However, the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Craft%20Air%20Cushion\"&gt;air-cushioned landing craft&lt;/a&gt; which allowed for over-the-horizon attacks made the class obsolete in the eyes of the United States Navy. Placed in &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20fleet\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt;, twelve were eventually sold to foreign navies, while the remaining eight have since been &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and description.\nThe \"Newport\" class were designed under project &lt;a href=\"Ship%20Characteristics%20Board\"&gt;SCB 247&lt;/a&gt; to meet the goal put forward by the United States &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20warfare\"&gt;amphibious forces&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;a href=\"tank%20landing%20ship\"&gt;tank landing ship&lt;/a&gt; (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow door&lt;/a&gt; form for LSTs would not be capable of such speed. Therefore, the designers of the \"Newport\" class came up with a design of a traditional &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;ship hull&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; ramp slung over the bow supported by two &lt;a href=\"derrick\"&gt;derrick&lt;/a&gt; arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the \"Newport\" class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nLSTs of the \"Newport\" class had a &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displacement&lt;/a&gt; of when light and at full load. They were &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and over the &lt;a href=\"derrick\"&gt;derrick&lt;/a&gt; arms which protruded past the bow. They had a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; forward of and at the stern at full load.\nThe first three ships of the class were fitted with six &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; 16-645-ES &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s, while the remainder of the class were fitted with six &lt;a href=\"Alco\"&gt;Alco&lt;/a&gt; 16-251 diesel engines turning two &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;shafts&lt;/a&gt;, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ships a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LSTs carried of &lt;a href=\"diesel%20fuel\"&gt;diesel fuel&lt;/a&gt; for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ships were also equipped with a &lt;a href=\"bow%20thruster\"&gt;bow thruster&lt;/a&gt; to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles.\nThe \"Newport\" class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Craft%20Utility\"&gt;utility landing craft&lt;/a&gt; (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The \"Newport\" class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have &lt;a href=\"davit\"&gt;davit&lt;/a&gt;s for four &lt;a href=\"LCVP%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;vehicle and personnel landing craft&lt;/a&gt; (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull.\nThe \"Newport\" class were initially armed with four Mark 33 &lt;a href=\"3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun\"&gt;/50 caliber guns&lt;/a&gt; in two twin &lt;a href=\"Gun%20turret\"&gt;turrets&lt;/a&gt;. They were equipped with two Mk 63 &lt;a href=\"Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20system\"&gt;gun control fire systems&lt;/a&gt; (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977\u20131978. They also had SPS-10 surface search &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a &lt;a href=\"helicopter%20deck\"&gt;helicopter deck&lt;/a&gt;. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers.\nUnited States service.\nConstruction and career.\nThe first vessel of the class, \"Newport\" was ordered as part of Fiscal Year (FY) 1965. The next eight were authorized in FY 1966, followed by eleven in 1967. The first three LSTs were constructed by &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Naval%20Shipyard\"&gt;Philadelphia Naval Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania and the remaining seventeen by &lt;a href=\"National%20Steel%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;National Steel and Shipbuilding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, California. Seven more were ordered in FY 1971, but these were later deferred, then canceled. Beginning in FY 1981, ships of the class were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20fleet\"&gt;Naval Reserve Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1994, the 3-inch guns had been removed as a weight saving measure. The 1987 introduction of LCACs \u2014 which allowed the United States Navy to launch over-the-horizon amphibious landings \u2014 made the \"Newport\" class obsolete, but they remained with the fleet for another decade because they were the only means by which the hundreds of thousands of gallons of motor vehicle fuel needed by a &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Marine Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; could be landed. Only the development of special fuel bladders which gave the LCACs a tanker capability allowed for their retirement.\nExport service.\nAustralia.\nTwo LSTs were acquired by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt; in 1994; \"Sagainaw\" on 25 August and \"Fairfax County\" on 27 September. Renamed \"Kanimbla\" and \"Manoora\", the two vessels underwent conversion in May 1995 at &lt;a href=\"Forgacs%20Shipyard\"&gt;Forgacs Shipbuilding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Newcastle, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. The LSTs were significantly modified by removing their bow ramps and adding another deck over the bow of the ship, allowing for a third landing spot and increased aviation fuel capacity. Over the new deck two &lt;a href=\"LCM-8%23Australian%20service\"&gt;LCM-8 landing craft&lt;/a&gt; are carried when the third landing spot is not used, handled by a 70-ton crane. Improved medical facilities were constructed. A &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt; was installed aft, allowing for the stowage of four &lt;a href=\"Sikorsky%20SH-60%20Seahawk\"&gt;Seahawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters. Both ships were based at &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Australia. The two vessels were taken out of service in 2011 and replaced by and the s.\nBrazil.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Navy\"&gt;Brazilian Navy&lt;/a&gt; leased one \"Newport\"-class LST from the United States on 26 August 1994. \"Cayuga\" was renamed \"Mattoso Maia\" and arrived in October. The vessel was acquired outright on 19 September 2000. Negotiations for a second vessel, \"Peoria\", were unsuccessfully ended in 2001.\nChile.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20Navy\"&gt;Chilean Navy&lt;/a&gt; leased one vessel of the class from the US. A second was offered, but the ship's poor condition led to it being rejected. \"San Bernardino\" was leased on 30 September 1995 and renamed \"Valdivia\". In 1997, the LST ran aground and was damaged. \"Valdivia\" was refloated and repaired. Due to the age of the vessel, \"Valdivia\" was taken out of service on 14 January 2011.\nMalaysia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Malaysian%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Malaysian Navy&lt;/a&gt; acquired one \"Newport\"-class LST from the United States on 16 December 1994. A second was to be leased in 1998, but the option was not taken up. \"Spartanburg County\" arrived in Malaysia in June 1995 and was renamed KD \"Sri Inderapura\". The vessel was refit between 1995 and 1998 at &lt;a href=\"Johore\"&gt;Johore&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 December 2002, the ship was damaged by fire. On 8 October 2009, while berthed at the &lt;a href=\"Lumut%2C%20Perak\"&gt;Lumut Naval Base&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sri Inderapura\" caught fire and sank. The vessel was later raised. \"Sri Inderapura\" was officially &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt; by the Royal Malaysian Navy on 21 January 2010.\nMexico.\nMexico acquired two ships from the United States. \"Newport\" was purchased on 18 January 2001 and renamed \"Sonora\" by the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Navy\"&gt;Mexican Navy&lt;/a&gt;, before becoming \"Rio Papaloapan\". \"Frederick\" was purchased on 9 December 2002 and renamed \"Usumacinta\". \"Rio Papaloapan\" is based at &lt;a href=\"Tampico\"&gt;Tampico&lt;/a&gt; and \"Usumacinta\" at &lt;a href=\"Manzanillo%2C%20Colima\"&gt;Manzanillo&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorocco.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Moroccan%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Moroccan Navy&lt;/a&gt; acquired one ship from the United States as a grant transfer on 16 August 1994. \"Bristol County\" was renamed \"Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah\" upon entering Moroccan service. The LST was acquired to replace the aging . By late 1995, \"Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah\" was considered non-operational but was later returned to service.\nSpain.\nTwo ships were leased by the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Navy\"&gt;Spanish Navy&lt;/a&gt; from the United States. The first, \"Barnstable County\" was recommissioned into the Spanish Navy on 26 August 1994 and renamed \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\". The second, \"Harlan County\", recommissioned on 14 April 1995 and was renamed \"Pizarro\". Both ships were based at &lt;a href=\"Rota%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Rota, Spain&lt;/a&gt;. \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\" was initially to be decommissioned in 2006, but continued until 2009, when the vessel was taken out of service. The LST was scrapped at Arinaga, &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Canaria\"&gt;Gran Canaria&lt;/a&gt;, Spain in 2014. \"Pizarro\" was decommissioned in December 2012 and sold for scrap in February 2016 and was broken up at &lt;a href=\"Cadiz\"&gt;Cadiz&lt;/a&gt; beginning in March.\nTaiwan.\nTwo ships were leased by the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20Navy\"&gt;Republic of China Navy&lt;/a&gt; (ROCN) from the United States on 1 July 1995. \"Manitowoc\" and \"Sumter\" were taken to &lt;a href=\"Newport%20News%20Shipbuilding\"&gt;Newport News Shipbuilding&lt;/a&gt; and refitted before being recommissioned into the ROCN on 8 May 1997 and renamed \"Chung Ho\" and \"Chung Ping\" respectively. The two ships were purchased on 29 September 2000."
