    "text": "The International Friendship Exhibition is a large &lt;a href=\"museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; complex located at &lt;a href=\"Myohyangsan\"&gt;Myohyangsan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Pyongan%20Province\"&gt;North Pyongan Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It is a collection of halls that house gifts presented to former leaders &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jong-il\"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt; from various foreign dignitaries. The protocol of gift-giving is well established in &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Korean culture&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBuilt in a traditional style, the halls opened on 26 August 1978 and consist of over 150 rooms covering a total area of between 28,000 and 70,000 square metres. The building offers the impression that it has windows, though it has none. According to a local legend, Kim Jong-il built the International Friendship Exhibition in three days; however, actual construction took a year. Currently, estimates of how many gifts the exhibition holds vary between 60,000 and 220,000 gifts. On entering the exhibition, shoes must be removed and visitors are asked to bow before &lt;a href=\"portraits%20of%20Kim%20Il-sung%20and%20Kim%20Jong-il\"&gt;portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;. Satellite imagery from 2017 shows increased underground activity at the site, suggesting an expansion may be underway.\nThe setting of the museum in the Myohyang mountains, near the &lt;a href=\"Pohyonsa\"&gt;Pohyon temple&lt;/a&gt;, was the subject of a poem by Kim Il-sung, which he later chanted from the balcony of the International Friendship Exhibition on October 15, 1979:\n&lt;poem&gt;\"On the balcony I see the most\nglorious scene in the world...\nThe Exhibition stands here,\nits green eaves upturned, to exalt\nThe dignity of the nation,\nand Piro Peak looks higher still.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe museum is said to act as &lt;a href=\"propaganda\"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt;, giving the impression of worldwide support for the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korean government&lt;/a&gt;. Visitors to the museum are informed that the number of gifts constitute \"proof of the endless love and respect toward the Great Leader .\" However, North Korean visitors to the site are unaware of the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20gift\"&gt;exchange of gifts in diplomatic protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and are described by Helen-Louise Hunter to be \"impressed by the self-serving explanations offered to them.\" Another author, Byoung-lo Philo Kim, states that the entire exhibition is \"aimed at convincing [North] Korean visitors that their leaders are universally admired.\"\nGifts.\nMost of the gifts received were from friendly &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; or like-minded nations and states. Such gifts include:"
