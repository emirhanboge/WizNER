As of 2022, Loren is one of the last surviving major stars from the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema\"&gt;Golden Age of Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; cinema and the only living person on AFI's list.\nEncouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her film career at age sixteen in 1950. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount&lt;/a&gt; in 1956 launched her international career. Her film appearances around this time include \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pride%20and%20the%20Passion\"&gt;The Pride and the Passion&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Houseboat%20%28film%29\"&gt;Houseboat&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"It%20Started%20in%20Naples\"&gt;It Started in Naples&lt;/a&gt;\". During the 1950s, she starred in films as a sexually emancipated personae and was one of the best known &lt;a href=\"sex%20symbol\"&gt;sex symbol&lt;/a&gt;s of the time.\nLoren's performance as Cesira in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Two%20Women\"&gt;Two Women&lt;/a&gt;\" (1961) directed by &lt;a href=\"Vittorio%20De%20Sica\"&gt;Vittorio De Sica&lt;/a&gt; won her the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Actress&lt;/a&gt;, making her the first actor to win an Oscar for a non-English-language performance. She holds the record for having earned seven &lt;a href=\"David%20di%20Donatello%20Awards\"&gt;David di Donatello Awards&lt;/a&gt; for Best Actress: \"Two Women\"; \"&lt;a href=\"Yesterday%2C%20Today%20and%20Tomorrow\"&gt;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963); \"&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Italian%20Style\"&gt;Marriage Italian Style&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964, for which she was nominated for a second Oscar); \"&lt;a href=\"Sunflower%20%281970%20film%29\"&gt;Sunflower&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970); \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Voyage%20%281974%20film%29\"&gt;The Voyage&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974); \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Day\"&gt;A Special Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Life%20Ahead\"&gt;The Life Ahead&lt;/a&gt;\" (2020). She has won five special &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Awards\"&gt;Golden Globes&lt;/a&gt; (including the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award\"&gt;Cecil B. DeMille Award&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"BAFTA%20Award\"&gt;BAFTA Award&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Awards\"&gt;Laurel Award&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award\"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Volpi%20Cup%20for%20Best%20Actress\"&gt;Volpi Cup for Best Actress&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Venice Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Best%20Actress%20Award%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29\"&gt;Best Actress Award&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. In 1991, she received the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Honorary%20Award\"&gt;Academy Honorary Award&lt;/a&gt; for lifetime achievements.\nBeginning at the start of the 1980s, Loren chose to make rarer film appearances. Since then, she has appeared in films such as \"&lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%AAt-%C3%A0-Porter%20%28film%29\"&gt;Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter&lt;/a&gt;\" (1994), \"&lt;a href=\"Grumpier%20Old%20Men\"&gt;Grumpier Old Men&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995), and \"&lt;a href=\"Nine%20%282009%20live-action%20film%29\"&gt;Nine&lt;/a&gt;\" (2009).\nEarly life.\nFamily and childhood.\nSofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone was born on 20 September 1934 in the Clinica Regina Margherita in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, the daughter of Romilda Villani (1910\u20131991) and Riccardo Scicolone (1907-1976), a construction engineer of noble descent (Loren wrote in her autobiography that she is entitled to call herself the &lt;a href=\"Marchioness\"&gt;Marchioness&lt;/a&gt; of Licata Scicolone Murillo).\nLoren's father, Riccardo Scicolone, refused to marry Villani, leaving the piano teacher and aspiring actress without financial support. Loren met with her father three times, at age five, age seventeen and in 1976 at his deathbed, stating that she forgave him but had never forgotten his abandonment of her mother. Loren's parents had another child together, her sister Maria, in 1938. Loren has two younger paternal half-brothers, Giuliano and Giuseppe. Romilda, Sofia, and Maria lived with Loren's grandmother in &lt;a href=\"Pozzuoli\"&gt;Pozzuoli&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the harbour and munitions plant in Pozzuoli was a frequent bombing target of the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt;. During one raid, as Loren ran to the shelter, she was struck by &lt;a href=\"Shrapnel%20%28fragment%29\"&gt;shrapnel&lt;/a&gt; and wounded in the chin. After that, the family moved to Naples, where they were taken in by distant relatives. After the war, Loren and her family returned to Pozzuoli. Loren's grandmother Luisa opened a pub in their living room, selling homemade cherry liquor. Romilda Villani played the &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;, Maria sang, and Loren waited on tables and washed dishes. The place was popular with the &lt;a href=\"G.I.%20%28military%29\"&gt;American GIs&lt;/a&gt; stationed nearby.\nPageantry.\nAt age 15, Loren as \"Sofia Lazzaro\" entered the &lt;a href=\"Miss%20Italia\"&gt;Miss Italia&lt;/a&gt; 1950 &lt;a href=\"beauty%20pageant\"&gt;beauty pageant&lt;/a&gt; and was assigned as Candidate No. 2, being one of the four contestants representing the &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; region. She was selected as one of the last three finalists and won the title of Miss Elegance 1950, while Liliana Cardinale won the title of Miss Cinema and Anna Maria Bugliari won the grand title of &lt;a href=\"Miss%20Italia\"&gt;Miss Italia&lt;/a&gt;. She returned in 2001 as president of the jury for the 61st edition of the pageant. In 2010, Loren crowned the 71st Miss Italia pageant winner.\nCareer.\nEarly roles: 1951\u20141957.\nSofia Lazzaro enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Centro%20Sperimentale%20di%20Cinematografia\"&gt;Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia&lt;/a&gt;, the national film school of Italy and appeared as an uncredited extra in &lt;a href=\"Mervyn%20LeRoy\"&gt;Mervyn LeRoy&lt;/a&gt;'s 1951 film \"&lt;a href=\"Quo%20Vadis%20%281951%20film%29\"&gt;Quo Vadis&lt;/a&gt;\", when she was 16 years old.\nThat same year, she appeared in the Italian film \"&lt;a href=\"Era%20lui...%20s%C3%AC%21%20s%C3%AC%21\"&gt;Era lui... s\u00ec! s\u00ec!&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she played an &lt;a href=\"odalisque\"&gt;odalisque&lt;/a&gt;, and was credited as \"Sofia Lazzaro\". In the early part of the decade, she played bit parts and had minor roles in several films, including &lt;a href=\"La%20Favorita%20%281952%29\"&gt;\"La Favorita\" (1952)&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Ponti\"&gt;Carlo Ponti&lt;/a&gt; changed her name and public image to appeal to a wider audience as \"Sophia Loren\", being a twist on the name of the Swedish actress &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A4rta%20Tor%C3%A9n\"&gt;M\u00e4rta Tor\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt; and suggested by &lt;a href=\"Goffredo%20Lombardo\"&gt;Goffredo Lombardo&lt;/a&gt;. Her first starring role was in \"&lt;a href=\"Aida%20%281953%20film%29\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt;\" (1953), for which she received critical acclaim.\nAfter playing the lead role in \"&lt;a href=\"Two%20Nights%20with%20Cleopatra\"&gt;Two Nights with Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;\" (1953), her breakthrough role was in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gold%20of%20Naples\"&gt;The Gold of Naples&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954), directed by &lt;a href=\"Vittorio%20De%20Sica\"&gt;Vittorio De Sica&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Too%20Bad%20She%27s%20Bad\"&gt;Too Bad She's Bad&lt;/a&gt;\", also released in 1954, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Miller%27s%20Beautiful%20Wife\"&gt;La Bella Mugnaia&lt;/a&gt;\" (1955) became the first of many films in which Loren co-starred with &lt;a href=\"Marcello%20Mastroianni\"&gt;Marcello Mastroianni&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next three years, she acted in many films, including \"&lt;a href=\"Scandal%20in%20Sorrento\"&gt;Scandal in Sorrento&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Lucky%20to%20Be%20a%20Woman\"&gt;Lucky to Be a Woman&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Boy%20on%20a%20Dolphin\"&gt;Boy on a Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Legend of the Lost&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pride%20and%20the%20Passion\"&gt;The Pride and the Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957), the latter film a Napoleonic era war-epic set in Spain starring &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Grant\"&gt;Cary Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise to stardom: 1958\u20141969.\nLoren became an international film star following her five-picture contract with &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; in 1958. Among her films at this time were \"&lt;a href=\"Desire%20Under%20the%20Elms%20%28film%29\"&gt;Desire Under the Elms&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Perkins\"&gt;Anthony Perkins&lt;/a&gt;, based upon the &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20O%27Neill\"&gt;Eugene O'Neill&lt;/a&gt; play; \"&lt;a href=\"Houseboat%20%28film%29\"&gt;Houseboat&lt;/a&gt;\", a romantic comedy co-starring &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Grant\"&gt;Cary Grant&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Cukor\"&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Heller%20in%20Pink%20Tights\"&gt;Heller in Pink Tights&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she appeared as a blonde for the first time.\nIn 1960, Loren starred in &lt;a href=\"Vittorio%20De%20Sica\"&gt;Vittorio De Sica&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Two%20Women\"&gt;Two Women&lt;/a&gt;\", a stark, gritty story of a mother who is trying to protect her 12-year-old daughter in war-torn Italy. The two end up gang-raped inside a church as they travel back to their home city following cessation of bombings there. Originally cast as the daughter, Loren fought against type and was eventually cast as the mother (actress &lt;a href=\"Eleonora%20Brown\"&gt;Eleonora Brown&lt;/a&gt; would portray the daughter). Loren's performance earned her many awards, including the &lt;a href=\"Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;'s best performance prize, and an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress\"&gt;Academy Award for Best Actress&lt;/a&gt;, the first major Academy Award for a non-English-language performance or to an Italian actress. She won 22 international awards for \"Two Women\". The film was extremely well received by critics and a huge commercial success. Though proud of this accomplishment, Loren did not show up to this award, citing fear of fainting at the award ceremony. Nevertheless, &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Grant\"&gt;Cary Grant&lt;/a&gt; telephoned her in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; the next day to inform her of the &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20award\"&gt;Oscar award&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1960s, Loren was one of the most popular actresses in the world, and continued to make films in the United States and Europe, starring with prominent leading men. In 1964, her career reached its pinnacle when she received $1 million to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1965, she received a second Academy Award nomination for her performance in \"&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Italian-Style\"&gt;Marriage Italian-Style&lt;/a&gt;\" opposite Marcello Mastroianni.\nAmong Loren's best-known films of this period are &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Bronston\"&gt;Samuel Bronston&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"epic%20film\"&gt;epic production&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"El%20Cid%20%28film%29\"&gt;\"El Cid\" (1961)&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Heston\"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Millionairess\"&gt;The Millionairess&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960) with &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sellers\"&gt;Peter Sellers&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"It%20Started%20in%20Naples\"&gt;It Started in Naples&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960) with &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Gable\"&gt;Clark Gable&lt;/a&gt;, Vittorio De Sica's triptych \"&lt;a href=\"Yesterday%2C%20Today%20and%20Tomorrow\"&gt;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963) with Marcello Mastroianni, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Ustinov\"&gt;Peter Ustinov&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20L\"&gt;Lady L&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965) with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Newman\"&gt;Paul Newman&lt;/a&gt;, the 1966 classic \"&lt;a href=\"Arabesque%20%281966%20film%29\"&gt;Arabesque&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Peck\"&gt;Gregory Peck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chaplin\"&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;'s final film, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Countess%20from%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;A Countess from Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;\" (1967) with &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Brando\"&gt;Marlon Brando&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoren received four &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe Award&lt;/a&gt;s between 1964 and 1977 as \"World Film Favorite\u00a0\u2013 Female\".\nContinued success: 1970\u20141990.\nLoren appeared in fewer movies after becoming a mother. During the next decade, most of her roles were in Italian features. During the 1970s, she was paired with &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Burton\"&gt;Richard Burton&lt;/a&gt; in the last De Sica-directed film, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Voyage%20%281974%20film%29\"&gt;The Voyage&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974), and a remake of the film \"&lt;a href=\"Brief%20Encounter%20%281974%20film%29\"&gt;Brief Encounter&lt;/a&gt;\" (1974). The film had its premiere on US television on 12 November 1974 as part of the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" series on NBC. In 1976, she starred in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cassandra%20Crossing\"&gt;The Cassandra Crossing&lt;/a&gt;\". It fared extremely well internationally, and was a respectable box office success in the US market. She co-starred with &lt;a href=\"Marcello%20Mastroianni\"&gt;Marcello Mastroianni&lt;/a&gt; again in &lt;a href=\"Ettore%20Scola\"&gt;Ettore Scola&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Day\"&gt;A Special Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977). This movie was nominated for 11 international awards such as two Oscars (best actor in leading role, best foreign picture). It won a Golden Globe Award and a C\u00e9sar Award for best foreign movie. Loren's performance was awarded with a David di Donatello Award, the seventh in her career. The movie was extremely well received by American reviewers and became a box office hit.\nFollowing this success, Loren starred in an American thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Brass%20Target\"&gt;Brass Target&lt;/a&gt;\". This movie received mixed reviews, although it was moderately successful in the United States and internationally. In 1978, she won her fourth Golden Globe for \"world film favorite\". Other movies of this decade were Academy Award nominee \"&lt;a href=\"Sunflower%20%281970%20film%29\"&gt;Sunflower&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970), which was a critical success, and Arthur Hiller's \"&lt;a href=\"Man%20of%20La%20Mancha%20%28film%29\"&gt;Man of La Mancha&lt;/a&gt;\" (1972), which was a critical and commercial failure despite being nominated for several awards, including two Golden Globes. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Peter O'Toole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Coco\"&gt;James Coco&lt;/a&gt; were nominated for two NBR awards, in addition the &lt;a href=\"National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures\"&gt;NBR&lt;/a&gt; listed \"Man of La Mancha\" in its best ten pictures of 1972 list.\nIn 1980, after the international success of the biography \"Sophia Loren: Living and Loving, Her Own Story\" by A. Hotchner, Loren portrayed herself and her mother in a made-for-television &lt;a href=\"biopic\"&gt;biopic&lt;/a&gt; adaptation of her &lt;a href=\"autobiography\"&gt;autobiography&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sophia Loren: Her Own Story\". Ritza Brown and Chiara Ferrari each portrayed the younger Loren. In 1981, she became the first female celebrity to launch her own &lt;a href=\"perfume\"&gt;perfume&lt;/a&gt;, 'Sophia', and a brand of eyewear soon followed.\nIn 1982, while in Italy, she made headlines after serving an 18-day prison sentence on &lt;a href=\"tax%20evasion\"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; charges \u2013 a fact that failed to hamper her popularity or career. In 2013, the supreme court of Italy cleared her of the charges.\nShe acted infrequently during the 1980s and in 1981 turned down the role of &lt;a href=\"Alexis%20Carrington\"&gt;Alexis Carrington&lt;/a&gt; in the television series \"&lt;a href=\"Dynasty%20%281981%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;\". Although she was set to star in 13 episodes of CBS's \"&lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Crest\"&gt;Falcon Crest&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1984 as Angela Channing's half-sister Francesca Gioberti, negotiations fell through at the last moment and the role went to &lt;a href=\"Gina%20Lollobrigida\"&gt;Gina Lollobrigida&lt;/a&gt; instead. Loren preferred devoting more time to raising her sons.\nLoren has recorded more than two dozen songs throughout her career, including a best-selling album of comedic songs with &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sellers\"&gt;Peter Sellers&lt;/a&gt;; reportedly, she had to fend off his romantic advances. Partly owing to Sellers's infatuation with Loren, he split with his first wife, Anne Howe. Loren has made it clear to numerous biographers that Sellers's affections were reciprocated only &lt;a href=\"platonic%20love\"&gt;platonically&lt;/a&gt;. This collaboration was covered in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Life%20and%20Death%20of%20Peter%20Sellers\"&gt;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&lt;/a&gt;\" where actress &lt;a href=\"Sonia%20Aquino\"&gt;Sonia Aquino&lt;/a&gt; portrayed Loren. The song \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Do%20You%20Go%20To%20%28My%20Lovely%29%3F\"&gt;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sarstedt\"&gt;Peter Sarstedt&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been inspired by Loren.\nLater career: 1991\u2014present.\nIn 1991, Loren received the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Honorary%20Award\"&gt;Academy Honorary Award&lt;/a&gt; stating that she has been \"One of the genuine treasures of &lt;a href=\"world%20cinema\"&gt;world cinema&lt;/a&gt; who, in a career rich with memorable performances, has added permanent luster to our art form.\" In 1995, she received the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe presented &lt;a href=\"Federico%20Fellini\"&gt;Federico Fellini&lt;/a&gt; with his honorary Oscar in April 1993. In 2009, Loren stated on \"&lt;a href=\"Larry%20King%20Live\"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;\" that Fellini had planned to direct her in a film shortly before his death in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Loren was selective about choosing her films and ventured into various areas of business, including &lt;a href=\"cookbook\"&gt;cookbook&lt;/a&gt;s, eyewear, jewelry, and perfume. She received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Altman\"&gt;Robert Altman&lt;/a&gt;'s film \"&lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%AAt-%C3%A0-Porter%20%28film%29\"&gt;Ready to Wear&lt;/a&gt;\" (1994), co-starring &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Roberts\"&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Springs%2C%20California\"&gt;Palm Springs&lt;/a&gt;, California, &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Springs%20Walk%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Walk of Stars&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated to her.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grumpier%20Old%20Men\"&gt;Grumpier Old Men&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995), Loren played a \"&lt;a href=\"femme%20fatale\"&gt;femme fatale&lt;/a&gt;\" opposite &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Matthau\"&gt;Walter Matthau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Lemmon\"&gt;Jack Lemmon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ann-Margret\"&gt;Ann-Margret&lt;/a&gt;. The film was a box-office success and became Loren's biggest US hit in years. At the &lt;a href=\"20th%20Moscow%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;20th Moscow International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, she was awarded an Honorable Prize for contribution to cinema. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Loren among the greatest female stars of Golden Age of Hollywood cinema. In 2001, Loren received a Special Grand Prix of the Americas Award at the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20World%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Montreal World Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; for her body of work. She filmed two projects in Canada during this time: the independent film \"&lt;a href=\"Between%20Strangers\"&gt;Between Strangers&lt;/a&gt;\" (2002), directed by her son Edoardo and co-starring &lt;a href=\"Mira%20Sorvino\"&gt;Mira Sorvino&lt;/a&gt;, and the television miniseries \"&lt;a href=\"Lives%20of%20the%20Saints%20%28TV%20miniseries%29\"&gt;Lives of the Saints&lt;/a&gt;\" (2004).\nIn 2009, after five years off the set and 14 years since she starred in a prominent US theatrical film, Loren starred in &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Marshall\"&gt;Rob Marshall&lt;/a&gt;'s film version of \"&lt;a href=\"Nine%20%282009%20live-action%20film%29\"&gt;Nine&lt;/a&gt;\", based on the &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; musical that tells the story of a director whose midlife crisis causes him to struggle to complete his latest film; he is forced to balance the influences of numerous formative women in his life, including his deceased mother.

Though Ponti had been long separated from his first wife, Giuliana, he was not legally divorced when Loren married him by proxy (two male lawyers stood in for them) in Mexico on 17 September 1957. The couple had their marriage annulled in 1962 to escape &lt;a href=\"bigamy\"&gt;bigamy&lt;/a&gt; charges, but continued to live together. In 1965, they became French citizens after their application was approved by then French Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Pompidou\"&gt;Georges Pompidou&lt;/a&gt;. Ponti then obtained a divorce from Giuliana in France, allowing him to marry Loren on 9 April 1966.\nThey had two children, &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Ponti%20Jr.\"&gt;Carlo Ponti Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, born on 29 December 1968, and &lt;a href=\"Edoardo%20Ponti\"&gt;Edoardo Ponti&lt;/a&gt;, born on 6 January 1973. Loren's daughters-in-law are &lt;a href=\"Sasha%20Alexander\"&gt;Sasha Alexander&lt;/a&gt; and Andrea Meszaros. Loren has four grandchildren.

Grant's wife &lt;a href=\"Betsy%20Drake\"&gt;Betsy Drake&lt;/a&gt; wrote the original script, and Grant originally intended that she would star with him. After he began an &lt;a href=\"Extramarital%20sex\"&gt;affair&lt;/a&gt; with Loren while filming \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pride%20and%20the%20Passion\"&gt;The Pride and the Passion&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957), Grant arranged for Loren to take Drake's place with a rewritten script for which Drake asked to not receive credit. The affair ended in bitterness before \"The Pride and the Passion\"s filming ended, causing problems on the \"Houseboat\" set. Grant hoped to resume the relationship, but Loren decided to marry &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Ponti%23Personal%20life\"&gt;Carlo Ponti&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nLawsuits.\nIn September 1999, Loren filed a lawsuit against 79 adult websites for posting altered nude photos of her on the internet.\nBox office rating.\nIn The &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20Herald\"&gt;Motion Picture Herald&lt;/a&gt;, both British and American exhibitors voted for Loren within the &lt;a href=\"Top%20Ten%20Money%20Making%20Stars%20Poll\"&gt;Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll&lt;/a&gt;:"
