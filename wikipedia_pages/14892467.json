    "text": "Jeanne Laverne Carmen (August 4, 1930 \u2013 December 20, 2007) was an American &lt;a href=\"model%20%28person%29\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"actress\"&gt;actress&lt;/a&gt; and trick-shot &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;er.\nEarly life and career.\nCarmen was born in &lt;a href=\"Paragould%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Paragould, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. As a child, she picked cotton before running away from home at age 13. As a teen, she moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and landed a job as a dancer in \"Burlesque\", with &lt;a href=\"Bert%20Lahr\"&gt;Bert Lahr&lt;/a&gt;. Later, she became a &lt;a href=\"Model%20%28person%29\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;, appearing as a &lt;a href=\"pin-up%20girl\"&gt;pin-up girl&lt;/a&gt; in several men's magazines, including \"Wink\", \"Titter\", and \"Beauty Parade\". She was a trick shot golfer, appearing with and managed by Jack Redmond. She toured country clubs and county fairs with Redmond and her then husband Sandy Scott. In her 20s, while on tour and traveling to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, she met &lt;a href=\"John%20Roselli\"&gt;Johnny Rosselli&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Outfit\"&gt;Chicago Outfit&lt;/a&gt;'s liaison in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, who drove her, without her husband, to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. The pair, now intimate, stayed at the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Inn\"&gt;Desert Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where they &lt;a href=\"confidence%20trick\"&gt;scammed&lt;/a&gt; rich victims who bet unsuccessfully against her winning games on the casino's golf course. Rosselli introduced her to &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;, who took her away from Las Vegas to &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; she appeared in &lt;a href=\"B-movie\"&gt;B-movie&lt;/a&gt;s such as \"&lt;a href=\"Guns%20Don%27t%20Argue\"&gt;Guns Don't Argue&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Monster%20of%20Piedras%20Blancas\"&gt;The Monster of Piedras Blancas&lt;/a&gt;\". She played both brassy platinum-blondes and (with her natural dark hair) sultry Spanish women. Carmen's smoldering good looks, hourglass figure, and striking green eyes quickly landed her on the big screen in 1956 playing a feisty Spanish senorita named \"Serelda\" in the film \"The Three Outlaws\", a Western based on the same events as the later \"&lt;a href=\"Butch%20Cassidy%20and%20the%20Sundance%20Kid\"&gt;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&lt;/a&gt;\", and co-starring &lt;a href=\"Neville%20Brand\"&gt;Neville Brand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Hale%2C%20Jr\"&gt;Alan Hale, Jr&lt;/a&gt; as Butch and Sundance. She was then cast by producer/director &lt;a href=\"Howard%20W.%20Koch\"&gt;Howard W. Koch&lt;/a&gt; as an Indian girl in \"War Drums\" alongside &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Barker\"&gt;Lex Barker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tarzan\"&gt;Tarzan&lt;/a&gt; fame. Koch took a liking to Carmen and cast her in his next film for Warner Bros, the teenage rock 'n' roll juvenile delinquent themed \"&lt;a href=\"Untamed%20Youth\"&gt;Untamed Youth&lt;/a&gt;\" (1957), co-starring &lt;a href=\"Rockabilly\"&gt;Rockabilly&lt;/a&gt; legend &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Cochran\"&gt;Eddie Cochran&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired Cochran to cover the song \"Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie\" for her.\nCarmen also appeared as a femme fatale in \"Portland Expos\u00e9\" alongside &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gorshin\"&gt;Frank Gorshin&lt;/a&gt; who later gained fame as the \"Riddler\" on the Batman TV series. She also appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Stooges\"&gt;Three Stooges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"short%20subject\"&gt;short subject&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Merry%20Mix%20Up\"&gt;A Merry Mix Up&lt;/a&gt;\" playing &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Besser\"&gt;Joe Besser&lt;/a&gt;'s girlfriend \"Mary\". The short is notable for the Stooges playing three sets of identical triplets.\nLater years.\nIn 1998, Carmen was the subject of a TV biography titled \"Jeanne Carmen: Queen of the B-Movies,\" on the series \"&lt;a href=\"E%21%20True%20Hollywood%20Story\"&gt;E! True Hollywood Story&lt;/a&gt;\". The show stated that Carmen maintained a \"dangerously close friendship with &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20Monroe\"&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20family\"&gt;The Kennedys&lt;/a&gt;\" and that after the death of Monroe, Carmen was told to leave town by Johnny Rosselli who was working for Chicago Mob Boss &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Giancana\"&gt;Sam Giancana&lt;/a&gt;. Believing her life was in danger, she fled to &lt;a href=\"Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Scottsdale, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived incognito for more than a decade. Carmen abandoned her platinum-blonde locks, had three children and lived a quiet life, never mentioning her prior life in Hollywood.\nCarmen's last published interview was on November 21, 2007, by \"&lt;a href=\"SX%20News\"&gt;SX News&lt;/a&gt;\", an Australian weekly gay and lesbian newspaper.\nDeath.\nOn December 20, 2007, aged 77, Jeanne Carmen died from &lt;a href=\"lymphoma\"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt; at her home in &lt;a href=\"Irvine%2C%20California\"&gt;Irvine, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she had resided since 1978.\nHer burial crypt headstone contains the &lt;a href=\"epitaph\"&gt;epitaph&lt;/a&gt;: \"She Came, She Saw, She Conquered.\" She was survived by three children, Melinda, Kellee Jade, and Brandon, and three grandchildren.\nAt the time of Carmen's death, a &lt;a href=\"biographical%20film\"&gt;biographical film&lt;/a&gt; of her life was in early stages of development, with &lt;a href=\"Christina%20Aguilera\"&gt;Christina Aguilera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarlett%20Johansson\"&gt;Scarlett Johansson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Bosworth\"&gt;Kate Bosworth&lt;/a&gt; under consideration to play Carmen."
