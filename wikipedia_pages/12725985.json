    "text": "Macromarketing is an interdisciplinary field that studies marketing as a provisioning technology of society. It focuses on marketing-society interactions including such topics as marketing systems, aggregate &lt;a href=\"consumer%20behavior\"&gt;consumer behavior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28economics%29\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"regulation\"&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20responsibility\"&gt;social responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethics\"&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt; in markets, and &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20marketing\"&gt;sustainable marketing&lt;/a&gt;. By comparison, \"micromarketing\" deals with how firms decide what to make, how to market it, and how much to price it. Some of key topics include the &lt;a href=\"tragedy%20of%20the%20commons\"&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Subliminal%20stimuli\"&gt;subliminal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"advertising\"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;, market symbolism and &lt;a href=\"environmental%20sustainability\"&gt;environmental sustainability&lt;/a&gt;. The notion of \"marketing systems\" is at the heart of macromarketing thought.\nMacromarketing may be a fairly recent term, but the ideas and interests that it comprises have existed as long as human history. For example, \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Peloponnesian%20War\"&gt;History of the Peloponnesian War&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Thucydides\"&gt;Thucydides&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Carta\"&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Travels%20of%20Marco%20Polo\"&gt;The Travels of Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt;\" are works that embody macromarketing themes. Macromarketing practice moreover is perhaps as old as society itself. Societies emerged for the welfare of the group; the need for &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20labour\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; and then exchanges of items produced by specialists surely was evident early on. Greater specialization and support for it begat &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28economics%29\"&gt;markets&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which linked many systems in any given society, from production to consumption\u2014were an efficient mechanism to sustain a society, which, fundamentally is a series of institutions and systems agreed upon by the members of the group. For example, even ancient markets like the &lt;a href=\"agora\"&gt;agora&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"bazaar\"&gt;bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; would have been built on systemic organization and coordination, bringing people together.\nModern macromarketing literature on contemporary society may discuss topics like &lt;a href=\"Subliminal%20stimuli\"&gt;subliminal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"advertising\"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sustainable%20packaging\"&gt;environmentally friendly packaging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"transgender\"&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"consumers\"&gt;consumers&lt;/a&gt;. Articles in the \"Journal of Macromarketing\" were about &lt;a href=\"marketing%20ethics\"&gt;marketing ethics&lt;/a&gt;, how American muslims use social media to connect with verified &lt;a href=\"halal\"&gt;halal&lt;/a&gt; markets, &lt;a href=\"destination%20marketing\"&gt;destination marketing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"place%20branding\"&gt;place branding&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"gastronomy\"&gt;gastronomy&lt;/a&gt;, and how U.S. nonprofits are addressing the \"&lt;a href=\"wicked%20problem\"&gt;wicked problem&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Gun%20violence%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;gun violence&lt;/a&gt; through macro-social marketing.\nMacromarketing models are &lt;a href=\"normative\"&gt;normative&lt;/a&gt; constructs, and the discipline that reflects society's value judgments and takes a stance on \"how the general marketing process should be conducted in the best interests of society\". Some scholars argued that \"improving our knowledge of marketing\" was a sort of \"social process of &lt;a href=\"resource%20mobilization\"&gt;resource mobilization&lt;/a&gt; that, among other things, focuses on an understanding of processes of social learning, adoption, and innovation\". In fact, some scholars worried that it was falling out of the spotlight, perhaps because the field was seen as \"the conscience of marketing practice\", which was less appealing in an academia that values \"objectivity and scientific enquiry\". macromarketing focused on\nHistory.\nThe term \"macromarketing\" was first used in 1962 by Robert Bartels in \"The Development of Marketing Thought\", in which he \"forecast future marketing developments, such as increasing &lt;a href=\"Conceptualization%20%28information%20science%29\"&gt;conceptualization&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=\"Comparative%20research\"&gt;comparative study&lt;/a&gt;, more interdisciplinary research, and a 'new concept of macro-marketing'\". Fifteen years later, he and Jenkins published their seminal 1977 article in the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Marketing\"&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/a&gt;\", where they wrote:\nMacromarketing has meant the marketing process in its entirety, and the aggregate mechanism of &lt;a href=\"institution\"&gt;institution&lt;/a&gt;s performing it. It has meant systems and groups of micro institutions, such as &lt;a href=\"Marketing%20channel\"&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conglomerate%20%28company%29\"&gt;conglomerates&lt;/a&gt;, industries, and associations, in contrast to their individual component units. More recently, it has meant the social context of micromarketing, its role in the national economy, and its application to the marketing of noneconomic &lt;a href=\"goods\"&gt;goods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe article won the \"Journal of Marketing\"'s Harold H. Maynard Award for its \"contribution to marketing thought and theory\". Hunt (1981) defines macromarketing as \u201cthe study of (1) marketing systems, (2) the impact and consequences of marketing systems on society, and (3) the impact and consequences of society on marketing systems\u201d (p. 7).\nThe Macromarketing Society, \"an international group of scholars\" that studies \"matters related to the varied interactions among markets, marketing, and society\", was founded in the 1970s. In 1976, Charles Slater organized the first Macro-Marketing Seminar at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder\"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, which was followed by subsequent seminars from 1977 to 1979. In 1978, the Macro-Marketing Editorial Advisory Board was formed to come up with a policy for the \"Journal of Macromarketing\". On August 9, 1979, the Advisory Board met again in &lt;a href=\"Boulder%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Boulder, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and the Macromarketing Society came to be.\nMarketing Systems Research.\nThe focus on marketing systems is a distinguishing aspect of macromarketing. The theoretical contribution of prof. Roger Layton in this area of research cannot be underestimated. Layton proposed MAS (mechanism, action, structure) theory of marketing systems. The MSPG (marketing systems as a public good) theory extends this research. \nThe Macromarketing Society.\nThe Macromarketing Society has held an Annual Macromarketing Conference since 1976 and has published the quarterly \"Journal of Macromarketing\" since 1981. It also liaises with organizations, governments, universities, and nonprofits that share an interest in macromarketing.\nThe Society is based on five pillars that \"deeply matter\" and affect everyone around the world:"
