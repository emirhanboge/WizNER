    "text": "D\u00e9FI () is a &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;social-liberal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regionalism%20%28politics%29\"&gt;regionalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Political%20parties%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;political party in Belgium&lt;/a&gt; mainly known for defending &lt;a href=\"French%20Community%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;French-speakers\u2019&lt;/a&gt; interests in and near the &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; region. The party is led by &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Smet\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois de Smet&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Chamber of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. The party's current name, \"D\u00e9FI\" or \"D\u00e9fi\", was adopted in 2016 and is a &lt;a href=\"backronym\"&gt;backronym&lt;/a&gt; of \"D\u00e9mocrate, F\u00e9d\u00e9raliste, Ind\u00e9pendant\" (literally, \"Democratic, Federalist, Independent\") meaning \"challenge\" in &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe party was founded as the Democratic Front of Francophones (\"Front D\u00e9mocratique des Francophones\", FDF) on 11 May 1964 as a response to the &lt;a href=\"Language%20legislation%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;language laws of 1962&lt;/a&gt;. The party had instant success in Brussels: it first contested parliamentary elections &lt;a href=\"1965%20Belgian%20general%20election\"&gt;one year later&lt;/a&gt;, where it won one senator and 3 seats in the Chamber of Representatives for the &lt;a href=\"arrondissement%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;constituency of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. Its number of seats increased further in the subsequent parliamentary elections. The party also dominated Brussels' municipal politics until 1982.\nInitially the party cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Walloon%20Rally\"&gt;Walloon Rally&lt;/a&gt;. From 1977 until 1980, the FDF participated in the federal governments led by &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Tindemans\"&gt;Leo Tindemans&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently &lt;a href=\"Wilfried%20Martens\"&gt;Wilfried Martens&lt;/a&gt;. From 1992, the FDF regularly competed in electoral alliance with the larger &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Reformist%20Party%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Liberal Reformist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PRL). In 2002 the PRL, the FDF, the &lt;a href=\"Mouvement%20des%20citoyens%20pour%20le%20changement\"&gt;MCC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Partei%20f%C3%BCr%20Freiheit%20und%20Fortschritt\"&gt;PFF&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Mouvement%20R%C3%A9formateur\"&gt;Reformist Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MR), a closer alliance of Francophone &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; parties.\nIn January 2010 the party name was amended to Francophone Democratic Federalists (\"F\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes D\u00e9mocrates Francophones\"), maintaining its original acronym. In September 2011, the FDF decided to leave the alliance over disagreements with MR president &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Michel\"&gt;Charles Michel&lt;/a&gt; on the agreement concerning the splitting of the &lt;a href=\"Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde\"&gt;Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde&lt;/a&gt; district during the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%932011%20Belgian%20government%20formation\"&gt;2010\u20132011 Belgian government formation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party adopted its current name, D\u00e9FI, in November 2015.\nPolicies.\nThe party advocates the extension of the bilingual status of &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; to some &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;municipalities&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Periphery\"&gt;Brussels Periphery&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Brabant\"&gt;Flemish Brabant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Region\"&gt;Flemish Region&lt;/a&gt;), where a majority of the population is French-speaking, but the official language is &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, and pushes for the rights of French-speakers in Flemish municipalities to use French instead of Dutch in dealing with Dutch-speaking officials. Both stances are opposed by Flemish parties, who say that French-speaking residents of the Flemish Region should learn Dutch and argue that the &lt;a href=\"Francization%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;Francization of Brussels&lt;/a&gt; should not further itself into the Region.\nRepresentation.\nNotable elected members include:"
