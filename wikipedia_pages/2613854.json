    "text": "North 24 Parganas (abv. 24 PGS (N)) or sometimes North Twenty Four Parganas is a district in southern &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, of eastern India. North 24 Parganas extends in the &lt;a href=\"tropical%20zone\"&gt;tropical zone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt; 22\u00b0 11\u2032 6\u2033 north to 23\u00b0 15\u2032 2\u2033 north and from longitude 88\u00ba20' east to 89\u00ba5' east. It is bordered to &lt;a href=\"Nadia%20district\"&gt;Nadia&lt;/a&gt; by north, to &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt; Division) by north and east, to &lt;a href=\"South%2024%20Parganas\"&gt;South 24 Parganas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kolkata%20district\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; by south and to Kolkata, &lt;a href=\"Howrah%20district\"&gt;Howrah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hooghly%20district\"&gt;Hoogly&lt;/a&gt; by west. &lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat&lt;/a&gt; is the district headquarters of North 24 Parganas. North 24 Parganas is West Bengal's most populous district and also (since 2014) the most populated district in the whole of India. It is the tenth-largest district in the State by area.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt;\", written in the second century A.D., the ancient land of Gangaridi was stretched between the rivers Bhagirathi-Hoogly (lower &lt;a href=\"Ganges\"&gt;Ganges&lt;/a&gt;) and Padma-Meghna. The modern-day 24 &lt;a href=\"Pargana\"&gt;Pargana&lt;/a&gt;s was the southern and the south-eastern territory of that legendary kingdom.\nArchaeological excavation at Berachampa village in Deganga PS proves that though the area was not directly attached to the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Guptas&lt;/a&gt;, yet it could not shun their cultural influence. &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt; () visited 30 &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; Biharas and 100 Hindu Temples in India and some of these were in the Greater 24 Parganas region.\nThe district was not a part of &lt;a href=\"Shashanka\"&gt;Shashanka&lt;/a&gt;'s unified Bengali empire known as &lt;a href=\"Gau%E1%B8%8Da%20region\"&gt;Gauda&lt;/a&gt;, but it is assumed that the district which was the south-west frontier territory of ancient Bengal, was comprised in under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Dharmapala\"&gt;Dharmapala&lt;/a&gt; (estimated c. 770\u2013810). The Pala rule was not quite strong in this part, as no excavation uncovered any of Buddhist Pala antiquities but many Hindu Sena sculptures.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the middle of the 16th century, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; pirates began to invade and plunder many of the waterways and prosperous human settlements in the lower delta region. People left these places out of the fear of being murdered, raped, or captured to be sold as slaves. The &lt;a href=\"Basirhat\"&gt;Basirhat&lt;/a&gt; sub-division of North 24 Parganas suffered most from these torments.\nShrihari (Shridhar), a Kayastha, was an influential officer in the service of Daud Khan Karrani. On the fall of Daud he fled away with the government treasure in his custody. He then set up a kingdom for himself in the marshy land to the extreme south of Khulna district (1574) and assumed the title of Maharaja. &lt;a href=\"Pratapaditya\"&gt;Pratapaditya&lt;/a&gt; succeeded to the kingship in 1574. The baharistan and the travel diary of Abdul Latif and the contemporary European writers, all testify to the personal ability of Pratapaditya, his political pre-eminence, material resources. His territories covered the greater part of what is now included in the greater Jessore, Khulna and Barisal districts. He established his capital at Dhumghat, a strategic position at the confluence of the Jamuna and Ichhamati before it was shifted to Ishwaripur.\n&lt;a href=\"Pratapaditya\"&gt;Maharaja Pratapaditya&lt;/a&gt;, soon became one of the 12 feudal lords of Bengal who not only declared their sovereignty from the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the ruling of &lt;a href=\"Jessore%20District\"&gt;Jessore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barisal\"&gt;Barisal&lt;/a&gt; and Greater 24 Parganas, but also fought and resisted the Portuguese in the early years of the 17th century. When he was finally defeated by the Mughals. Pratapaditya lost both the battles of Salka and Magrahat. His fate was sealed and he was compelled to tender submission to Islam Khan at Dhaka. His kingdom was annexed. He probably died at Benares on his way to Delhi from Dhaka, as a prisoner of war to the Mughals.\nAfter his death, Bhavanand Majumdar, who had been in the service of Pratapaditya, was given the throne by Raja Man Singh, and he later became the founder of the Nadiya Raj family. Laksmikanta Gangopadhyay better known as &lt;a href=\"Laksmikanta%20Roy%20Choudhury\"&gt;Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury&lt;/a&gt;, the well known Brahmin scholar who was the son of great saint Kamdev Brahmachari and also a close associate of Raja Basanta Ray, was given tax free \"jaigir\" of eight parganas, including the areas in and around Kalikatah as \"Gurudakshina\" by Raja &lt;a href=\"Man%20Singh\"&gt;Man Singh&lt;/a&gt; in 1608.\nJashoreshwari Kali Temple (built by &lt;a href=\"Maharaja%20Pratapaditya\"&gt;Pratapaditya&lt;/a&gt;), Chanda Bhairab Mandir at Ishwaripur (built during the Sena period), Five domed Tenga Mosque at Banshipur (Mughal period), two big and four small domed Hammankhana (constructed by &lt;a href=\"Maharaja%20Pratapaditya\"&gt;Pratapaditya&lt;/a&gt;) at Bangshipur, Govinda Dev Temple at Gopalpur (built by Basanta Roy, uncle of &lt;a href=\"Maharaja%20Pratapaditya\"&gt;Maharaja Pratapaditya&lt;/a&gt; in 1593), Jahajghata Port (Khanpur), Kalighat Temple (owned by &lt;a href=\"Laksmikanta%20Roy%20Choudhury\"&gt;Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury&lt;/a&gt;) bear archaeological evidences of the Bhuiyan and Majumdar kings.\nBritish Raj.\nThe territory of Greater 24 Parganas were under the &lt;a href=\"Saptagram\"&gt;Satgaon&lt;/a&gt; (ancient Saptagram, now in Hoogly district) administration during the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20era\"&gt;Mughal era&lt;/a&gt; and later it was included in Hoogly chakla (district under post-Mughal Nawabi rule) during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Murshid%20Quli%20Khan\"&gt;Murshid Quli Khan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1757, after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Plassey\"&gt;Battle of Plassey&lt;/a&gt;, Nawab &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Jafar\"&gt;Mir Jafar&lt;/a&gt; conferred the Zamindari of 24 parganas and janglimahals (small administrative units) upon the &lt;a href=\"British%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;British East India Company&lt;/a&gt;. These Parganas are 1.Akbarpur, 2.Amirpur 3.Asimabad 4.Balia 5.Baridhati 6.Basandhari 7.Calcutta 8.Dakshin Sagar 9.Garh 10.Hathiagarh 11.Ikhtiarpur 12.Kharijuri 13.Khaspur 14.Maidanmal or Mednimall 15.Magura 16. Mayda 17.Manpur 18.Murnagacha 19.Paikan 20.Pechakuli 21.Satal 22.Shahnagar 23.Shahpur and 24. Uttar Pargana (O'Mally, L.S.S. (1914) Bengal District Gazetteers: 24 Parganas. Page 44).\n. Since then, this entire territory is known as Twentyfour Parganas.\nIn 1751, the Company assigned &lt;a href=\"John%20Zephaniah%20Holwell\"&gt;John Zephaniah Holwell&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"zemindar\"&gt;zemindar&lt;/a&gt; of the District. In 1759, after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Plassey\"&gt;Bengali War&lt;/a&gt; of 1756\u20131757, the Company assigned it to &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Clive\"&gt;Lord Clive&lt;/a&gt; as a personal Jaghir (zamindari) and after his death it again came under the direct authority of the company.\nIn 1793, during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Cornwallis\"&gt;Lord Cornwallis&lt;/a&gt;, entire &lt;a href=\"Sunderbans\"&gt;Sunderbans&lt;/a&gt; were in Twentyfour Parganas. In 1802, some parganas on the western banks of river Hoogly were included into it. These parganas were in &lt;a href=\"Nadia%20district\"&gt;Nadia&lt;/a&gt; earlier. In 1814, a separate collectorate was established in Twenty-four Parganas. In 1817, Falta and &lt;a href=\"Baranagar\"&gt;Baranagar&lt;/a&gt; and in 1820, some portions of Nadia's Balanda and Anwarpur were encompassed to it. In 1824, portions of &lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt; and Bakhargunge (now in Bangladesh) were also included to it. In 1824, the district headquarters was shifted from Kolkata to Baruipur, but in 1828, it was removed to &lt;a href=\"Alipore\"&gt;Alipore&lt;/a&gt;. In 1834, the district was split into two districts \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Alipore\"&gt;Alipore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat&lt;/a&gt;, but later these were united again.\nIn 1905, some portion of this district around the Sunderbans was detached and linked to Khulna and Barishal. These parts remained in &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; territories where Jessore's Bangaon was joined to Twentyfour Pargana after the 1947 partition.\nAfter Independence.\nIn 1980, an administrative reform committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Ashok Mitra suggested to split the district into two and as per the recommendation of the committee in 1983, 1 March two districts \u2013 North 24 Parganas (24 PGS (N)) and South 24 Parganas (24 PGS (S)) were created. The North 24 Parganas which was included to the &lt;a href=\"Presidency\"&gt;Presidency&lt;/a&gt; Division has been formed with five sub-divisions of the Greater 24 Parganas, namely &lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat Sadar&lt;/a&gt; (Headquarters), &lt;a href=\"Barrackpore\"&gt;Barrackpore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basirhat\"&gt;Basirhat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangaon\"&gt;Bangaon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bidhannagar\"&gt;Bidhannagar&lt;/a&gt; (a satellite township of Kolkata, popularly known as Salt Lake).\nGeography.\nThe district lies within the &lt;a href=\"Ganga\"&gt;Ganga&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Brahmaputra\"&gt;Brahmaputra&lt;/a&gt; delta. The major distributory of river &lt;a href=\"Ganga\"&gt;Ganga&lt;/a&gt; that is river &lt;a href=\"Hooghly%20River\"&gt;Hooghly&lt;/a&gt; flows along the western border of the district. There are many other distributory branches, sub-branches of Ganga river and other local rivers, which include the &lt;a href=\"Ichamati%20River\"&gt;Ichhamati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamuna%20River%20%28West%20Bengal%29\"&gt;Jamuna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bidyadhari%20River\"&gt;Bidyadhari&lt;/a&gt;.\nLand.\nThe type of soil varies widely from alluvial to clay loam.\nGroundwater arsenic contamination.\nNorth 24 Parganas is one of the nine severely &lt;a href=\"Arsenic%20contamination%20of%20groundwater\"&gt;arsenic affected&lt;/a&gt; districts in West Bengal. On the basis of updated survey conducted by School of Environmental Studies (SOES), &lt;a href=\"Jadavpur%20University\"&gt;Jadavpur University&lt;/a&gt;, out of total 22 administrative blocks in 22, 21 and 16 blocks arsenic above the 10 \u03bcg/L (WHO Recommended value of arsenic in drinking water), 50 \u03bcg/L (Indian standard value of arsenic in drinking water) and 300 \u03bcg/L (the concentration predicting overt arsenical skin lesions) was noted respectively.\nThe maximum arsenic contamination level found in this district is 2830 \u03bcg/L in the Baduria block.\nClimate.\nThe climate is tropical, like the rest of the Gangetic West Bengal. It is also characterised by the Monsoon, which lasts from early June to mid September sometimes in October. The weather remains dry during the winter (late November to mid February) and too humid during summer.\nTemperature ranges from 41\u00a0\u00b0C in May and 10\u00a0\u00b0C in January while &lt;a href=\"relative%20humidity\"&gt;relative humidity&lt;/a&gt; ranges between 50% in March &amp; 90% in July.\nThe average annual rainfall is 1,579mm.\nEconomy.\nPeople are mainly engaged in farming, fishing and other agricultural activities. The average size of agricultural landholdings is about 3.2 Bighas. North 24 Parganas is one of the less economically backward districts of &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, but there is chronic poverty in the southern half of the District (the &lt;a href=\"Sundarbans\"&gt;Sundarbans&lt;/a&gt; area)\nThe information technology hub of &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; is at this district, which is the centre of some of the notable IT/&lt;a href=\"ITES\"&gt;ITES&lt;/a&gt; Indian and &lt;a href=\"Multinational%20corporation\"&gt;multinational&lt;/a&gt; companies. Approximately 1,500 companies have their offices in Sector V. Majority of the corporate offices are situated in Sector V and Sector III. Around 3.5 Lakh (by 2017) people are employed in Salt Lake City.\nDivisions.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nThe district comprises five subdivisions: Barrackpore, Barasat Sadar, Basirhat, Bangaon and Bidhannagar.\n&lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat&lt;/a&gt; is the district headquarters. There are 35 police stations, 22 development blocks, 27 municipalities, 200 &lt;a href=\"gram%20panchayat\"&gt;gram panchayat&lt;/a&gt;s and 1599 villages in this district.\nOther than municipality area, each subdivision contains community development blocks which in turn are divided into rural areas and census towns. In total there are 48 urban units: 27 municipalities and 20 &lt;a href=\"census%20town\"&gt;census town&lt;/a&gt;s and 1 cantonment board.\n&lt;a href=\"Bidhannagar%20subdivision\"&gt;Bidhannagar subdivision&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis subdivision consists of the &lt;a href=\"Bidhannagar%20Municipal%20Corporation\"&gt;Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssembly constituencies.\nAs per order of the &lt;a href=\"Delimitation%20Commission\"&gt;Delimitation Commission&lt;/a&gt; in respect of the &lt;a href=\"delimitation%20of%20constituencies\"&gt;delimitation of constituencies&lt;/a&gt; in the West Bengal, the district is divided into 33 assembly constituencies:\nEducation.\nColleges.\nKanchrapara College\nSchools.\n&lt;a href=\"Sodepur%20High%20School\"&gt;\u2022 Sodepur High School&lt;/a&gt;\nCulture.\nThis district is rich in culture.

Jessore Road and Biman Bandar railway stations are closed for the construction work of Noapara\u2013Dum Dum Airport\u2013Barasat Metro rail (&lt;a href=\"Kolkata%20Metro%20Line%204\"&gt;Kolkata Metro Line 4&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Kolkata%20Metro\"&gt;Metro rail&lt;/a&gt; is also a transport medium of this district's people. Four stations of &lt;a href=\"Kolkata%20Metro%20Line%201\"&gt;Kolkata Metro Line 1&lt;/a&gt; are located here, &lt;a href=\"Dum%20Dum%20metro%20station\"&gt;Dum Dum metro station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dum%20Dum\"&gt;Dum Dum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baranagar%20metro%20station\"&gt;Baranagar metro station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Baranagar\"&gt;Baranagar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dakshineswar%20metro%20station\"&gt;Dakshineswar metro station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dakshineswar\"&gt;Dakshineswar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Noapara%20metro%20station\"&gt;Noapara metro station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Noapara%2C%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Noapara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baranagar\"&gt;Baranagar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirports.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Netaji%20Subhash%20Chandra%20Bose%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"IATA\"&gt;IATA&lt;/a&gt; code:CCU), which is at &lt;a href=\"Dum%20Dum\"&gt;Dum Dum&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as Dum Dum Airport) in &lt;a href=\"North%2024%20Parganas\"&gt;North 24 Parganas&lt;/a&gt;, is the only airport serving the city &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;. It operates both domestic and international flights. It is a gateway to North-East India, Bangkok, and Bangladesh. The number of people using the airport has consistently increased over the last few years.\nRoadways.\nThe road network is fairly well developed. Sparsed across by state-highways, it provides a convenient means of transport. &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%2012%20%28India%29\"&gt;NH \n12&lt;/a&gt; connects the district with northern and southern region of the state and its sub road &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20112%20%28India%29\"&gt;NH 112&lt;/a&gt; connect the district headquarter &lt;a href=\"Barasat\"&gt;Barasat&lt;/a&gt; with the border town &lt;a href=\"Bangaon\"&gt;Bangaon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petrapole\"&gt;Petrapole&lt;/a&gt;, the largest land port of India.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"2011%20census%20of%20India\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt; North 24 Parganas district has a &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20India\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; of 10,009,781, roughly equal to the nation of &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; or the US state of &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. This gave it a ranking of second in India (out of a total of &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20India\"&gt;640&lt;/a&gt;) and first in its state. However, in 2014 the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20district\"&gt;Thane district&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;), which had been ranked first in India in 2011, was divided into two, thus promoting North 24 Parganas District to first in India.
