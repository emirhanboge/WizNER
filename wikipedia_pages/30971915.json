    "text": "Instructure, Inc. is an &lt;a href=\"educational%20technology\"&gt;educational technology&lt;/a&gt; company based in &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;. It is the developer and publisher of Canvas, a Web-based &lt;a href=\"learning%20management%20system\"&gt;learning management system&lt;/a&gt;, and MasteryConnect, an Assessment Management System. The company is owned by &lt;a href=\"private%20equity%20firm\"&gt;private equity firm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thoma%20Bravo\"&gt;Thoma Bravo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nInstructure was founded in 2008 by two &lt;a href=\"BYU\"&gt;BYU&lt;/a&gt; graduate students, Brian Whitmer and Devlin Daley. Instructure's initial funding came from &lt;a href=\"Mozy\"&gt;Mozy&lt;/a&gt; founder Josh Coates, who served as Instructure's CEO from 2010-2018 and chairman of the board through 2020, as well as from Epic Ventures.\nIn December 2010 the &lt;a href=\"Utah%20Education%20Network\"&gt;Utah Education Network&lt;/a&gt; (UEN), which represents a number of Utah colleges and universities, announced that Instructure would be replacing &lt;a href=\"Blackboard%20Inc.\"&gt;Blackboard&lt;/a&gt; as their preferred &lt;a href=\"Learning%20management%20system\"&gt;LMS&lt;/a&gt; supplier. By January 2013, Instructure's platform was in use by more than 300 colleges, universities and K\u201312 districts, and the company's customer base had increased to 9 million users by the end of 2013.\nIn February 2011 Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an &lt;a href=\"Affero%20General%20Public%20License\"&gt;AGPL&lt;/a&gt; license as &lt;a href=\"open%20source%20software\"&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;, a move which garnered press coverage due to its threat to then market leader Blackboard. As of 2020, while the core Canvas LMS remains open source, according to its GitHub FAQ some Canvas functions and add-ons are proprietary.\nIn June 2013 Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M. In February 2015, it raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M. CEO Josh Coates described it as \"a pre-&lt;a href=\"IPO\"&gt;IPO&lt;/a&gt; round.\" On November 13, 2015, the firm began trading as a publicly held company on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIn 2016 &lt;a href=\"Glassdoor\"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; named the firm #4 on its Best Places to Work list. In 2018, the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Salt%20Lake%20Tribune\"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;\" named it its #6 \"Top Work Places\" for large businesses.\nIn December 2019 Instructure announced that &lt;a href=\"Thoma%20Bravo\"&gt;Thoma Bravo&lt;/a&gt; would acquire the company for $2 billion. Thoma Bravo completed the acquisition of Instructure in March 2020.\nIn June 2021, Instructure again filed for an Initial Public Offering.\nProducts.\nCanvas.\nInstructure Inc. was created to support the continued development of a learning management system (LMS) originally named Instructure. Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas. The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20University\"&gt;Utah State University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brigham%20Young%20University\"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; before officially launching the system. As of 2020, it is used in approximately 4,000 institutions around the world.\nIn 2011 Canvas launched its &lt;a href=\"iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20app\"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2013, its &lt;a href=\"Android%20%28operating%20system%29\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; app, enabling mobile access to the platform. The apps were eventually split into Canvas Student and Canvas Teacher, separating features for students and instructors. In 2016, the firm launched Canvas Parent, their mobile app for parents, for both iOS and Android, allowing parents of K\u201312 students to stay informed on their children's assignments, grades, and overall schooling.\nIn August 2020, 16 states across the United States confirmed a partnership with Instructure in order to adopt its Canvas LMS platform for their educational institutions. The states said that, by adopting Canvas as a statewide solution to the challenges raised by the global &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, they hoped to provide stronger support to educators and students.\nCanvas Catalog.\nIn 2014 Instructure launched Canvas Catalog, a course catalog tool designed to help schools market their course offerings to non-traditional learners and for professional development.\nCanvas Studio.\nIn 2016 Instructure launched Canvas Studio (originally branded as Arc) a video learning platform tightly integrated with Canvas LMS designed to deliver asynchronous video content and video quizzing, as well as video editing and archiving functionality.\nPortfolium.\nIn 2019 Instructure acquired Portfolium and integrated their Pathways, Program Assessment and ePortfolio network into the Canvas learning management platform. Portfolium is designed to simplify the assessment of student learning, showcase evidence of learning, and keep students engaged along pathways to prepare them for careers.\nMasteryConnect.\nIn 2019 Instructure also acquired MasteryConnect. MasteryConnect is a K-12 assessment management system that enables data-driven instruction and personalized learning with tools for formative and interim assessments, teacher collaboration, and curriculum planning.\nCertica.\nIn 2020 Instructure acquired Certica Solutions, which provides assessment content and analytics primarily to K-12 districts in the USA. Products added through this acquisition include the Navigate Item Bank, CASE Benchmarks, CASE Item Banks, Videri, Academic Benchmarks, Certify, DataConnect, and prebuilt formative offerings.\nImpact.\nIn 2021 Instructure acquired EesySoft, a Dutch educational technology company, and rebranded the EesySoft product to Impact by Instructure. Impact is designed to help educators and students to more effectively use educational technology products by embedding guides, tutorials, and prompts into the software.\nBridge.\nOn February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge, a cloud-based corporate LMS. This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by &lt;a href=\"Insight%20Venture%20Partners\"&gt;Insight Venture Partners&lt;/a&gt;. EPIC Ventures and &lt;a href=\"Bessemer%20Venture%20Partners\"&gt;Bessemer Venture Partners&lt;/a&gt; also participated in the funding. This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million. At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20State%20University\"&gt;Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt;, which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students since fall 2015. Bridge now serves more than 500 clients. On February 15, 2021 it was announced that Bridge was acquired by Learning Technologies Group (LTG). [33][34]"
