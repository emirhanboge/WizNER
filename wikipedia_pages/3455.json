    "text": "Barbados is an &lt;a href=\"island%20country\"&gt;island country&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Antilles\"&gt;Lesser Antilles&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; region of the Americas, and the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is in length and up to in width, covering an area of . It is in the western part of the North Atlantic, east of the &lt;a href=\"Windward%20Islands\"&gt;Windward Islands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Barbados is located roughly &lt;a href=\"13th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;13\u00b0N&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt;. It is about east of both the countries of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Lucia\"&gt;Saint Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines\"&gt;Saint Vincent and the Grenadines&lt;/a&gt; and south-east of &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt; and north-east of &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;. Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic &lt;a href=\"hurricane%20belt\"&gt;hurricane belt&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital and largest city is &lt;a href=\"Bridgetown%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabited by &lt;a href=\"Island%20Caribs\"&gt;Kalinago&lt;/a&gt; people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt;s, Spanish navigators took possession of Barbados in the late 15th century, claiming it for the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Crown of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511. The &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese Empire&lt;/a&gt; claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; ship, the \"Olive Blossom\", arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of the island in the name of &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;King James I&lt;/a&gt;. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and Barbados became an &lt;a href=\"English%20overseas%20possessions\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"British%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas%23British%20Caribbean%20colonies\"&gt;British colony&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, the colony operated on a &lt;a href=\"plantation%20economy\"&gt;plantation economy&lt;/a&gt;, relying on the labour of &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;enslaved Africans&lt;/a&gt; who worked on the island's plantations. The slave trade to the island continued until it was outlawed by the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807\"&gt;Slave Trade Act 1807&lt;/a&gt;, with final emancipation of the enslaved population in Barbados occurring over a period of five years following the &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833\"&gt;Slavery Abolition Act 1833&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 30 November 1966, Barbados became an independent state and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20realm\"&gt;Commonwealth realm&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Queen of Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2021, &lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Mason\"&gt;Sandra Mason&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"2021%20Barbadian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; to become the first &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;President of Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. On 30 November 2021, Mason replaced Queen Elizabeth as &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt;, with Barbados transitioning to a &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20republic\"&gt;republic within the Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarbados's population of 287,000 is predominantly of African descent. While it is an Atlantic island, Barbados is closely associated with the Caribbean and is ranked as one of its leading tourist destinations.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Barbados\" is from either the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; term or the Spanish equivalent, , both meaning \"the bearded ones\". It is unclear whether \"bearded\" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded &lt;a href=\"fig-tree\"&gt;fig-tree&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Ficus%20citrifolia\"&gt;Ficus citrifolia&lt;/a&gt;\"), indigenous to the island, or to the allegedly bearded &lt;a href=\"Island%20Caribs\"&gt;Caribs&lt;/a&gt; who once inhabited the island, or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying coral reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoese&lt;/a&gt; mapmaker &lt;a href=\"Visconte%20Maggiolo\"&gt;Visconte Maggiolo&lt;/a&gt; showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of &lt;a href=\"Barbuda\"&gt;Barbuda&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Leeward%20Islands\"&gt;Leewards&lt;/a&gt; is very similar in name and was once named \"\" by the Spanish.\nThe original name for Barbados in the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Columbian%20era\"&gt;Pre-Columbian era&lt;/a&gt; was , according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Arawakan%20languages\"&gt;Arawakan&lt;/a&gt;-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including \"Red land with white teeth\" or \"Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)\" or simply \"Teeth\".\nColloquially, Barbadians refer to their home island as \"Bim\" or other nicknames associated with Barbados, including \"Bimshire\". The origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Cultural%20Foundation\"&gt;National Cultural Foundation&lt;/a&gt; of Barbados says that \"Bim\" was a word commonly used by &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s, and that it derives from the &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20language\"&gt;Igbo&lt;/a&gt; term from meaning \"my home, kindred, kind\"; the Igbo phoneme in the Igbo orthography is very close to . The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20people\"&gt;Igbo people&lt;/a&gt; from modern-day southeastern &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; arriving in Barbados in the 18th century. The words \"Bim\" and \"Bimshire\" are recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Oxford%20English%20Dictionary\"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Chambers%20Dictionary\"&gt;Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;\". Another possible source for \"Bim\" is reported to be in the \"Agricultural Reporter\" of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Hendy%20Jones%20Greenidge\"&gt;Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge&lt;/a&gt;) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were \"Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire\". Lastly, in the \"Daily Argosy\" (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652, there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of \"Byam\", the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as \"Bims\" and that this became a word for all Barbadians.\nHistory.\nPre-colonial period.\nArcheological evidence suggests humans may have first settled or visited the island circa 1600 BC. More permanent &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt; settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD, by a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Saladoid\"&gt;Saladoid&lt;/a&gt;-Barrancoid. The two main groups were the &lt;a href=\"Arawaks\"&gt;Arawaks&lt;/a&gt; from South America, who became dominant around 800\u20131200 AD, and the more war-like &lt;a href=\"Kalinago\"&gt;Kalinago&lt;/a&gt; (Island Caribs) who arrived from South America in the 12th\u201313th centuries.\nEuropean arrival.\nIt is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados, which probably would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century. One lesser-known source points to earlier revealed works antedating contemporary sources, indicating it could have been the Spanish. Many, if not most, believe the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Portugal%20%281415%E2%80%931578%29\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, en route to Brazil, were the first Europeans to come upon the island. The island was largely ignored by Europeans, though Spanish slave raiding is thought to have reduced the native population, with many fleeing to other islands.\nEnglish settlement in the 17th century.\nThe first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now &lt;a href=\"Holetown\"&gt;Holetown&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Jamestown, after King James I of England), by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Powell%20%28governor%29\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English indentured labourers. Some sources state that some Africans were amongst these first settlers.\nThe settlement was established as a &lt;a href=\"proprietary%20colony\"&gt;proprietary colony&lt;/a&gt; and funded by Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Courten\"&gt;William Courten&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands. The first colonists were actually tenants, and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company. Courten's title was later transferred to &lt;a href=\"James%20Hay%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle\"&gt;James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle&lt;/a&gt;, in what was called the \"Great Barbados Robbery\". Carlisle then chose as governor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Hawley%20%28governor%29\"&gt;Henry Hawley&lt;/a&gt;, who established the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20House%20of%20Assembly\"&gt;House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.\nIn the period 1640\u20131660, the West Indies attracted over two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas. By 1650 there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the &lt;a href=\"Chesapeake%20Bay\"&gt;Chesapeake&lt;/a&gt; and 23,000 in &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;. Most English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given \"freedom dues\" of about \u00a310, usually in goods. Before the mid-1630s, they also received of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land. During the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum%20%28England%29\"&gt;Cromwellian era&lt;/a&gt; (1650s) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war, vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped, who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants. These last two groups were predominantly Irish, as several thousand were infamously rounded up by English merchants and sold into servitude in Barbados and other Caribbean islands during this period, a practice that came to be known as being \"Barbadosed\". Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, &lt;a href=\"ginger\"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"indigo\"&gt;indigo&lt;/a&gt; was thus handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; industry in the 1640s and the growing reliance on and importation of enslaved Africans.\nParish registers from the 1650s show that for the white population, there were four times as many deaths as marriages. The mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growth export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s as Chesapeake production expanded.\nEffects of the English Civil War.\nAround the same time, fighting during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;War of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum%20%28England%29\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters. The island was not &lt;a href=\"English%20overseas%20possessions%20in%20the%20Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;involved in the war&lt;/a&gt; until after the execution of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt;, when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remaining loyal to &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; while the Barbadian &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Assembly\"&gt;House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt;). To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the &lt;a href=\"Rump%20Parliament%23Commonwealth%20of%20England\"&gt;Commonwealth Parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and Barbados, and because the island also traded with the Netherlands, further &lt;a href=\"Navigation%20Acts\"&gt;Navigation Acts&lt;/a&gt; were passed, prohibiting any but English vessels trading with &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Empire%23Atlantic\"&gt;Dutch colonies&lt;/a&gt;. These acts were a precursor to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War\"&gt;First Anglo-Dutch War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20England\"&gt;Commonwealth of England&lt;/a&gt; sent an invasion force under the command of &lt;a href=\"George%20Ayscue\"&gt;Sir George Ayscue&lt;/a&gt;, which arrived in October 1651. Ayscue, with a smaller force that included Scottish prisoners, surprised a larger force of Royalists, but had to resort to spying and diplomacy ultimately. On 11 January 1652, the Royalists in the House of Assembly led by &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Willoughby%2C%205th%20Baron%20Willoughby%20of%20Parham\"&gt;Lord Willoughby&lt;/a&gt; surrendered, which marked the end of royalist privateering as a major threat. The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Charter%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Charter of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Oistins\"&gt;Treaty of Oistins&lt;/a&gt;), which was signed at the Mermaid's Inn, &lt;a href=\"Oistins\"&gt;Oistins&lt;/a&gt;, on 17 January 1652.\nIrish people in Barbados.\nStarting with &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt;, a large percentage of the white labourer population were indentured servants and involuntarily transported people from Ireland. Irish servants in Barbados were often treated poorly, and Barbadian planters gained a reputation for cruelty. The decreased appeal of an indenture on Barbados, combined with enormous demand for labour caused by sugar cultivation, led to the use of involuntary transportation to Barbados as a punishment for crimes, or for political prisoners, and also to the kidnapping of labourers who were sent to Barbados involuntarily. Irish indentured servants were a significant portion of the population throughout the period when white servants were used for plantation labour in Barbados, and while a \"steady stream\" of Irish servants entered the Barbados throughout the seventeenth century, Cromwellian efforts to pacify Ireland created a \"veritable tidal wave\" of Irish labourers who were sent to Barbados during the 1650s. Due to inadequate historical records, the total number of Irish labourers sent to Barbados is unknown, and estimates have been \"highly contentious\". While one historical source estimated that as many as 50,000 Irish people were transported to either Barbados or Virginia unwillingly during the 1650s, this estimate is \"quite likely exaggerated\". Another estimate that 12,000 Irish prisoners had arrived in Barbados by 1655 has been described as \"probably exaggerated\" by historian Richard B. Sheridan. According to historian Thomas Bartlett, it is \"generally accepted\" that approximately 10,000 Irish were sent to the West Indies involuntarily, and approximately 40,000 came as voluntary indentured servants, while many also travelled as voluntary, un-indentured emigrants.\nThe sugar revolution.\nThe introduction of &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Brazil\"&gt;Dutch Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in 1640 completely transformed society, the economy and the physical landscape. Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries. One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry was the &lt;a href=\"Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardic Jews&lt;/a&gt;, who had originally been expelled from the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20peninsula\"&gt;Iberian peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, to end up in &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Brazil\"&gt;Dutch Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and enslaved Africans, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644 the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by enslaved Africans. By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island, many choosing to emigrate to &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Thirteen%20Colonies\"&gt;American Colonies&lt;/a&gt; (notably the Carolinas). As a result, Barbados enacted a &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Slave%20Code\"&gt;slave code&lt;/a&gt; as a way of legislatively controlling its black enslaved population. The law's text was influential in laws in other colonies.\nBy 1680 there were 20,000 free whites and 46,000 enslaved Africans; by 1724, there were 18,000 free whites and 55,000 enslaved Africans.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe harsh conditions endured by the slaves resulted in several planned slave rebellions, the largest of which was &lt;a href=\"Bussa%27s%20rebellion\"&gt;Bussa's rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in 1816 which was suppressed by British troops. Growing opposition to slavery led to its abolition in the British Empire in 1833. The &lt;a href=\"plantocracy\"&gt;plantocracy&lt;/a&gt; class retained control of political and economic power on the island, with most workers living in relative poverty.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hurricane%20of%201780\"&gt;1780 hurricane&lt;/a&gt; killed over 4,000 people on Barbados. In 1854, a &lt;a href=\"cholera\"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants.\n20th century before independence.\nDeep dissatisfaction with the situation on Barbados led many to emigrate. Things came to a head in the 1930s during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, as Barbadians &lt;a href=\"British%20West%20Indian%20labour%20unrest%20of%201934%E2%80%931939\"&gt;began demanding&lt;/a&gt; better conditions for workers, the legalisation of trade unions and a widening of the franchise, which at that point was limited to male property owners. As a result of the increasing unrest the British sent a commission, called the &lt;a href=\"Report%20of%20West%20India%20Royal%20Commission%20%28Moyne%20Report%29\"&gt;West Indies Royal Commission, or Moyne Commission&lt;/a&gt;, in 1938, which recommended enacting many of the requested reforms on the islands. As a result, Afro-Barbadians began to play a much more prominent role in the colony's politics, with universal suffrage being introduced in 1950.\nProminent among these early activists was &lt;a href=\"Grantley%20Herbert%20Adams\"&gt;Grantley Herbert Adams&lt;/a&gt;, who helped found the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Barbados Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (BLP) in 1938. He became the first Premier of Barbados in 1953, followed by fellow BLP-founder &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Gordon%20Cummins\"&gt;Hugh Gordon Cummins&lt;/a&gt; from 1958 to 1961. A group of left-leaning politicians who advocated swifter moves to independence broke off from the BLP and founded the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29\"&gt;Democratic Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (DLP) in 1955. The DLP subsequently won the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;1961 Barbadian general election&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Errol%20Barrow\"&gt;Errol Barrow&lt;/a&gt; became premier.\nFull internal self-government was enacted in 1961. Barbados joined the short-lived &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20Federation\"&gt;West Indies Federation&lt;/a&gt; from 1958 to 1962, later gaining full independence on 30 November 1966. Errol Barrow became the country's first prime minister. Barbados opted to remain within the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe effect of independence meant that the Queen of the United Kingdom ceased to have sovereignty over Barbados, but the island chose to remain a constitutional monarchy with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Alexandra%20Mary\"&gt;Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Queen of Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Monarch&lt;/a&gt; was represented locally by a &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-independence era.\nThe Barrow government sought to diversify the economy away from agriculture, seeking to boost industry and the tourism sector. Barbados was also at the forefront of regional integration efforts, spearheading the creation of &lt;a href=\"CARIFTA\"&gt;CARIFTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CARICOM\"&gt;CARICOM&lt;/a&gt;. The DLP lost the &lt;a href=\"1976%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;1976 Barbadian general election&lt;/a&gt; to the BLP under &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Adams%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Tom Adams&lt;/a&gt;. Adams adopted a more conservative and strongly pro-Western stance, allowing the Americans to use Barbados as the launchpad for their &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20invasion%20of%20Grenada\"&gt;invasion of Grenada&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. Adams died in office in 1985 and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Bernard%20St.%20John\"&gt;Harold Bernard St. John&lt;/a&gt;; however, St. John lost the &lt;a href=\"1986%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;1986 Barbadian general election&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the return of the DLP under Errol Barrow, who had been highly critical of the US intervention in Grenada. Barrow, too, died in office, and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20Erskine%20Sandiford\"&gt;Lloyd Erskine Sandiford&lt;/a&gt;, who remained Prime Minister until 1994.\n&lt;a href=\"Owen%20Arthur\"&gt;Owen Arthur&lt;/a&gt; of the BLP won the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;1994 Barbadian general election&lt;/a&gt;, remaining Prime Minister until 2008. Arthur was a strong advocate of republicanism, though a planned referendum to replace Queen Elizabeth as Head of State in 2008 never took place. The DLP won the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;2008 Barbadian general election&lt;/a&gt;, but the new Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"David%20Thompson%20%28Barbadian%20politician%29\"&gt;David Thompson&lt;/a&gt; died in 2010 and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Freundel%20Stuart\"&gt;Freundel Stuart&lt;/a&gt;. The BLP returned to power &lt;a href=\"2018%20Barbadian%20general%20election\"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Mottley\"&gt;Mia Mottley&lt;/a&gt;, who became Barbados's first female Prime Minister.\nTransition to republic.\nThe Government of Barbados announced on 15 September 2020 that it intended to become a republic by 30 November 2021, the 55th anniversary of its independence resulting in the replacement of the hereditary monarch of Barbados with an elected president. Barbados would then cease to be a &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20realm\"&gt;Commonwealth realm&lt;/a&gt;, but could maintain membership in the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 20 September 2021, just over a full year after the announcement for the transition was made, the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2021 was introduced to the Parliament of Barbados. Passed on 6 October, the Bill made amendments to the Constitution of Barbados, introducing the office of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;President of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; to replace the role of &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Alexandra%20Mary\"&gt;Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of Barbados. The following week, on 12 October 2021, incumbent &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Governor-General of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; Sandra Mason was jointly nominated by the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition as candidate to be the first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;President of Barbados&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently &lt;a href=\"2021%20Barbadian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt; on 20 October. Mason took office on 30 November 2021. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Charles\"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt;, who was heir apparent to the Barbadian Crown, attended the swearing-in ceremony in Bridgetown at the invitation of the Government of Barbados.\nQueen Elizabeth II sent a message of congratulations to President Mason and the people of Barbados, saying: \"As you celebrate this momentous day, I send you and all Barbadians my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future.\"\nA survey was taken between October 23, 2021 and November 10, 2021 by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies\"&gt;University of the West Indies&lt;/a&gt; that showed 34% of respondents being in favour of transitioning to a republic, while 30% were indifferent. Notably, no overall majority was found in the survey; with 24% not indicating a preference, and the remaining 12% being opposed to the removal of Queen Elizabeth.\nGeography and climate.\nBarbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; Islands. Barbados is the easternmost island in the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Antilles\"&gt;Lesser Antilles&lt;/a&gt;. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Windward%20Islands\"&gt;Windward Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The island rises gently to the central highland region known as Scotland District, with the high point of the nation being &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hillaby\"&gt;Mount Hillaby&lt;/a&gt; above sea level.\nIn the parish of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Michael%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Saint Michael&lt;/a&gt; lies Barbados's capital and main city, &lt;a href=\"Bridgetown\"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;, containing one third of the country's population. Other major towns scattered across the island include &lt;a href=\"Holetown\"&gt;Holetown&lt;/a&gt;, in the parish of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20James%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Saint James&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Oistins\"&gt;Oistins&lt;/a&gt;, in the parish of &lt;a href=\"Christ%20Church%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Christ Church&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Speightstown\"&gt;Speightstown&lt;/a&gt;, in the parish of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Saint Peter&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeology.\nBarbados lies on the boundary of the &lt;a href=\"South%20American%20plate\"&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Plate\"&gt;Caribbean Plate&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"subduction\"&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt; of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an &lt;a href=\"Accretionary%20wedge\"&gt;accretionary prism&lt;/a&gt;. The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about per 1,000 years. This subduction means &lt;a href=\"Geology\"&gt;geologically&lt;/a&gt; the island is composed of &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt; roughly thick, where reefs formed above the sediment. The land slopes in a series of \"terraces\" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. A large proportion of the island is circled by &lt;a href=\"coral%20reefs\"&gt;coral reefs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe erosion of limestone in the northeast of the island, in the Scotland District, has resulted in the formation of various caves and &lt;a href=\"Gully\"&gt;gullies&lt;/a&gt;. On the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; east coast of the island &lt;a href=\"coastal%20landforms\"&gt;coastal landforms&lt;/a&gt;, including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area. Also notable in the island is the rocky cape known as &lt;a href=\"Pico%20Teneriffe%20%28Barbados%29\"&gt;Pico Teneriffe&lt;/a&gt; or Pico de Tenerife, which is named after the fact that the island of &lt;a href=\"Tenerife\"&gt;Tenerife&lt;/a&gt; in Spain is the first land east of Barbados according to the belief of the locals.\nClimate.\nThe country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the \"&lt;a href=\"wet%20season\"&gt;wet season&lt;/a&gt;\", this period runs from June to December. By contrast, the \"&lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;dry season&lt;/a&gt;\" runs from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between .\nFrom December to May the average temperatures range from , while between June and November, they range from .\nOn the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (Am). However, breezes of abound throughout the year and give Barbados a &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; which is moderately tropical.\nInfrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, &lt;a href=\"landslip\"&gt;landslip&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hurricanes\"&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;. Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's &lt;a href=\"tropical%20storm\"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hurricanes\"&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal &lt;a href=\"hurricane%20strike%20zone\"&gt;hurricane strike zone&lt;/a&gt;. On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Janet\"&gt;Hurricane Janet&lt;/a&gt; in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Tomas\"&gt;Hurricane Tomas&lt;/a&gt;, but this caused only minor damage across the country as it was only at Tropical Storm level of formation.\nEnvironmental issues.\nBarbados is susceptible to environmental pressures. As one of the world's most &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20island%20countries%20by%20population%20density\"&gt;densely populated isles&lt;/a&gt;, the government worked during the 1990s to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs. As of the first decade of the 21st century, a second treatment plant has been proposed along the island's west coast. Being so densely populated, Barbados has made great efforts to protect its underground &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs a coral-limestone island, Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth. The government has placed great emphasis on protecting the catchment areas that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams. On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas, and the government has removed squatters to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs which provide the island's drinking water.\nThe government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island. Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas come from the Coastal Zone Management Unit (CZMU). Barbados has nearly of coral reefs just offshore and two protected marine parks have been established off the west coast. Overfishing is another threat which faces Barbados.\nAlthough on the opposite side of the Atlantic, and some west of Africa, Barbados is one of many places in the American continent that experience heightened levels of &lt;a href=\"mineral%20dust\"&gt;mineral dust&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20Desert\"&gt;Sahara Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs surrounding Barbados or &lt;a href=\"asthmatic\"&gt;asthmatic&lt;/a&gt; episodes, but evidence has not wholly supported the former claim.\nAccess to &lt;a href=\"biocapacity\"&gt;biocapacity&lt;/a&gt; in Barbados is much lower than world average. In 2016, Barbados had 0.17 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Barbados used 0.84 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their &lt;a href=\"ecological%20footprint\"&gt;ecological footprint&lt;/a&gt; of consumption. This means they use approximately five times as much biocapacity as Barbados contains. As a result, Barbados is running a biocapacity deficit.\nWildlife.\nBarbados is host to four species of nesting turtles (&lt;a href=\"green%20turtles\"&gt;green turtles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loggerhead%20sea%20turtle\"&gt;loggerheads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hawksbill%20turtle\"&gt;hawksbill turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"leatherbacks\"&gt;leatherbacks&lt;/a&gt;) and has the second-largest hawksbill turtle-breeding population in the Caribbean. The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity is discouraged in nesting areas.\nBarbados is also the host to the &lt;a href=\"green%20monkey\"&gt;green monkey&lt;/a&gt;. The green monkey is found in West Africa from Senegal to the Volta River. It has been introduced to the Cape Verde islands off north-western Africa, and the West Indian islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis, Saint Martin, and Barbados. It was introduced to the West Indies in the late 17th century when slave trade ships travelled to the Caribbean from West Africa. The green monkey in most cases, is well known to be a very curious and mischievous/troublesome creature to the locals on the island.\nDemographics.\nThe 2010 national census conducted by the Barbados Statistical Service reported a resident population of 277,821, of which 144,803 were female and 133,018 were male.\nThe life expectancy for Barbados residents is 80 years. The average life expectancy is 83 years for females and 79 years for males (2020). Barbados and Japan have the highest per capita occurrences of &lt;a href=\"centenarian\"&gt;centenarian&lt;/a&gt;s in the world.\nThe crude birth rate is 12.23 births per 1,000 people, and the crude death rate is 8.39 deaths per 1,000 people. The infant mortality rate is 11.63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.\nEthnic groups.\nClose to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as \"Bajan\") are of &lt;a href=\"Afro-Caribbean\"&gt;Afro-Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; descent (\"&lt;a href=\"Afro-Barbadian\"&gt;Afro-Bajans&lt;/a&gt;\") and mixed descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (\"Anglo-Bajans\" / \"Euro-Bajans\") mainly from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and Italy. Other European groups consisted of the French, Austrians, Spaniards, and Russians. Asians, predominantly from Hong Kong and India (both Hindu and Muslim) make up less than 1% of the population.\nOther groups in Barbados include people from the United States and Canada. Barbadians who return after years of residence in the United States and children born in America to Bajan parents are called \"Bajan Yankees\", a term considered derogatory by some. Generally, Bajans recognise and accept all \"children of the island\" as Bajans, and refer to each other as such.\nThe biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:\nLanguages.\nEnglish is the &lt;a href=\"official%20language\"&gt;official language&lt;/a&gt; of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of &lt;a href=\"British%20English\"&gt;British English&lt;/a&gt;. For most people, however, &lt;a href=\"Bajan%20Creole\"&gt;Bajan Creole&lt;/a&gt; is the language of everyday life. It does not have a standardised written form, but it is used by over 90% of the population.\nReligion.\nChristianity is the largest religion in Barbados, with the largest denomination being &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; (23.9% of the population in 2019). Other Christian denominations with significant followings in Barbados are the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; (administered by &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Bridgetown\"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Pentecostals\"&gt;Pentecostals&lt;/a&gt; (19.5%), &lt;a href=\"Jehovah%27s%20Witness\"&gt;Jehovah's Witness&lt;/a&gt;es, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church\"&gt;Seventh-day Adventist Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Baptist\"&gt;Spiritual Baptist&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; was the official state religion until its legal disestablishment by the Parliament of Barbados following independence. As of 2019, 21% of Barbadians report having &lt;a href=\"irreligion\"&gt;no religion&lt;/a&gt;, making the non-religious the second largest group after Anglicans. Smaller religions in Barbados include &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Barbados\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Barbados\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe state is considered &lt;a href=\"secular%20state\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt;, guaranteeing &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;freedom of religion or belief&lt;/a&gt; to all and featuring only symbolic allusions to a higher power in the preamble to the constitution.\nGovernment and politics.\nBarbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20republic\"&gt;parliamentary republic&lt;/a&gt; modelled on the British &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20system\"&gt;Westminster system&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;President of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 presently &lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Mason\"&gt;Sandra Mason&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 elected by the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Parliament of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; for a term of four years, and advised on matters of the Barbadian state by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Prime Minister of Barbados&lt;/a&gt;, who is &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20government\"&gt;head of government&lt;/a&gt;. There are 30 representatives within the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20House%20of%20Assembly\"&gt;House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, the lower chamber of Parliament.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;Constitution of Barbados&lt;/a&gt; is the supreme law of the country. Legislation is passed by the Parliament of Barbados but does not have the force of law unless the President grants her assent to that law. The right to withhold assent is absolute and cannot be overridden by Parliament. The Attorney General heads &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20of%20Barbados\"&gt;the independent judiciary&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1990s, at the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Manning\"&gt;Patrick Manning&lt;/a&gt;, Barbados attempted a &lt;a href=\"political%20union\"&gt;political union&lt;/a&gt; with Trinidad and Tobago and &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;. The project stalled after the then prime minister of Barbados, &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20Erskine%20Sandiford\"&gt;Lloyd Erskine Sandiford&lt;/a&gt;, became ill and his &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29\"&gt;Democratic Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; lost the next general election. Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and with Guyana, claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\nBarbados is a party to the &lt;a href=\"Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court\"&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical culture.\nBarbados functions as a &lt;a href=\"two-party%20system\"&gt;two-party system&lt;/a&gt;. The dominant political parties are the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29\"&gt;Democratic Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and the incumbent &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Barbados Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;. Since independence on 30 November 1966, the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) has governed from 1966 to 1976; 1986 to 1994; and from 2008 to 2018; and the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) has governed from 1976 to 1986; 1994 to 2008; and from 2018 to present.\nForeign relations.\nBarbados follows a policy of &lt;a href=\"Non-Aligned%20Movement\"&gt;nonalignment&lt;/a&gt; and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states. Barbados is a full and participating member of the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Community\"&gt;Caribbean Community&lt;/a&gt; (CARICOM), &lt;a href=\"CARICOM%20Single%20Market%20and%20Economy\"&gt;CARICOM Single Market and Economy&lt;/a&gt; (CSME), the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Caribbean%20States\"&gt;Association of Caribbean States&lt;/a&gt; (ACS), the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20American%20States\"&gt;Organization of American States&lt;/a&gt; (OAS), the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Caribbean Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (CCJ). In 2005, the Parliament of Barbados voted on a measure replacing the UK's &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council\"&gt;Judicial Committee of the Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Caribbean Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Port of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, Trinidad and Tobago.\nWorld Trade Organization, European Commission, CARIFORUM.\nBarbados is an original member (1995) of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Organization\"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WTO) and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; relations and cooperation with Barbados are carried out both on a bilateral and a regional basis. Barbados is party to the &lt;a href=\"Cotonou%20Agreement\"&gt;Cotonou Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, through which, , it is linked by an &lt;a href=\"Economic%20Partnership%20Agreement\"&gt;Economic Partnership Agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Commission\"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the &lt;a href=\"African%2C%20Caribbean%20and%20Pacific%20Group%20of%20States\"&gt;African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States&lt;/a&gt; (ACP). CARIFORUM is the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. There are also ongoing EU-&lt;a href=\"Community%20of%20Latin%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20States\"&gt;Community of Latin American and Caribbean States&lt;/a&gt; (CELAC) and EU-&lt;a href=\"CARIFORUM\"&gt;CARIFORUM&lt;/a&gt; dialogues.\nTrade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports.\nThe Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994.\nOn 6 July 1994, at the Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados, representatives of eight countries signed the Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaties 1994. The countries which were represented were: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.\nOn 19 August 1994, a representative of the Government of Guyana signed a similar treaty.\nMilitary and law enforcement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Barbados Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; has roughly 800 members. Within it, service members aged 14 to 18 years make up the Barbados Cadet Corps. The defence preparations of the island nation are closely tied to defence treaties with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the People's Republic of China.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Police%20Service\"&gt;Barbados Police Service&lt;/a&gt; is the sole law enforcement agency on the island of Barbados.\nAdministrative divisions.\nBarbados is &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20division\"&gt;divided&lt;/a&gt; into 11 parishes:\nSt. George and St. Thomas are in the middle of the country and are the only parishes without coastlines.\nEconomy.\nBarbados is the 52nd &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29%20per%20capita\"&gt;richest country in the world&lt;/a&gt; in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, has a well-developed &lt;a href=\"mixed%20economy\"&gt;mixed economy&lt;/a&gt;, and a moderately high &lt;a href=\"standard%20of%20living\"&gt;standard of living&lt;/a&gt;. According to the World Bank, Barbados is one of 83 &lt;a href=\"high%20income%20economy\"&gt;high income economies&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Despite this, a 2012 self-study in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Development%20Bank\"&gt;Caribbean Development Bank&lt;/a&gt; revealed 20% of Barbadians live in poverty, and nearly 10% cannot meet their basic daily food needs.\nHistorically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt; cultivation and related activities, but since the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners.\nPartly due to the staging of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the island saw a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes. This slowed during the 2008 to 2012 world economic crisis and the recession.\nThere was a strong economy between 1999 and 2000 but the economy went into recession in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the &lt;a href=\"11%20September%202001%20attacks\"&gt;11 September 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and the &lt;a href=\"7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings\"&gt;7 July 2005 London bombings&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. The economy rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004 which continued right through to 2008. The economy went into recession again from 2008 to 2013 before showing growth from 2014 to 2017. Then it declined to another recession from 2017 to 2019 during the world economic crisis. There were 23 downgrades by both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The economy showed signs of recovery with 3 upgrades from Standard and Poor's and Moody's in 2019. From 1 January to 31 March 2020 the economy had started to grow, but then it experienced another decline due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20recession\"&gt;COVID-19 economic recession&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditional trading partners include Canada, the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Community\"&gt;Caribbean Community&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;), the United Kingdom and the United States. Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage &lt;a href=\"foreign%20direct%20investment\"&gt;foreign direct investment&lt;/a&gt;, and privatise remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment was reduced to 10.7% in 2003. However, it has since increased to 11.9% in second quarter, 2015.\nThe European Union is assisting Barbados with a program of modernisation of the country's International Business and Financial Services Sector.\nBarbados maintains the third largest &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; in the Caribbean region. , officials at the stock exchange were investigating the possibility of augmenting the local exchange with an International Securities Market (ISM) venture.\nSovereign default and restructuring.\nBy May 2018, Barbados's outstanding debt climbed to , more than 1.7 times the country's &lt;a href=\"GDP\"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2018 the government defaulted on its sovereign debt when it failed to make a coupon on &lt;a href=\"Eurobond%20%28international%29\"&gt;Eurobond&lt;/a&gt;s maturing in 2035. Outstanding bond debt of Barbados reached .\nIn October 2019, Barbados concluded restructuring negotiations with a creditor group including investments funds &lt;a href=\"Eaton%20Vance\"&gt;Eaton Vance Management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greylock%20Capital%20Management\"&gt;Greylock Capital Management&lt;/a&gt;, Teachers Advisors and Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry. Creditors will exchange existing bonds for a new debt series maturing in 2029. The new bonds involve a principal \"haircut\" of approximately 26% and include a clause allowing for deferment of principal and capitalization of interest in the event of a natural disaster.\nHealth.\nThe main hospital on the island is &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%2C%20Bridgetown\"&gt;The Queen Elizabeth Hospital&lt;/a&gt;; however, Barbados has eight polyclinics across five parishes. There are also well-known medical care centres in Barbados such as Bayview Hospital, Sandy Crest Medical Centre and FMH Emergency Medical Clinic.\nEducation.\nThe Barbados &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20literacy%20rate\"&gt;literacy rate&lt;/a&gt; is ranked close to 100%. The mainstream public education system of Barbados is fashioned after the British model. The government of Barbados spends 6.7% of its GDP on education (2008).\nAll young people in the country must attend school until age 16. Barbados has over 70 primary schools and over 20 secondary schools throughout the island. There is a number of private schools, including &lt;a href=\"Montessori%20education\"&gt;Montessori&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"International%20Baccalaureate\"&gt;International Baccalaureate&lt;/a&gt;. Student enrolment at these schools represents less than 5% of the total enrolment of the public schools.\nCertificate-, diploma- and degree-level education in the country is provided by the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Community%20College\"&gt;Barbados Community College&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Jackman%20Prescod%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Codrington%20College\"&gt;Codrington College&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies%2C%20Cave%20Hill%20Campus\"&gt;Cave Hill campus&lt;/a&gt; and Open Campus of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies\"&gt;University of the West Indies&lt;/a&gt;. Barbados is also home to several overseas medical schools, such as &lt;a href=\"Ross%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;Ross University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"American%20University%20of%20Integrative%20Sciences\"&gt;American University of Integrative Sciences, School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducational testing.\nBarbados Secondary School Entrance Examination: Children who are 11 years old on 1 September in the year of the examination are required to write the examination as a means of allocation to secondary school.\nCaribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations are usually taken by students after five years of secondary school and mark the end of standard secondary education. The CSEC examinations are equivalent to the Ordinary Level (O-Levels) examinations and are targeted toward students 16 and older.\nCaribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) are taken by students who have completed their secondary education and wish to continue their studies. Students who sit for the CAPE usually possess CSEC or an equivalent certification. The CAPE is equivalent to the British Advanced Levels (A-Levels), voluntary qualifications that are intended for university entrance.\nCulture.\nBarbados is a blend of West African, &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20culture\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, Creole, &lt;a href=\"Indian%20culture\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20culture\"&gt;British culture&lt;/a&gt;s. Citizens are officially called Barbadians. The term \"Bajan\" (pronounced BAY-jun) may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian, which at times can sound more like \"Bar-bajan\"; or, more likely, from English \"&lt;a href=\"bay\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"bayling\"), Portuguese .\nThe largest &lt;a href=\"carnival\"&gt;carnival&lt;/a&gt;-like cultural event that takes place on the island is the &lt;a href=\"Crop%20Over\"&gt;Crop Over&lt;/a&gt; festival, which was established in 1974. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries, Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to there to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities, and features the majority of the island's homegrown &lt;a href=\"calypso%20music\"&gt;calypso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soca%20music\"&gt;soca music&lt;/a&gt; for the year. The male and female Barbadians who harvested the most sugarcane are crowned as the King and Queen of the crop. Crop Over gets under way at the beginning of July and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August. New calypso/soca music is usually released and played more frequently from the beginning of May to coincide with the start of the festival.\nCuisine.\nBajan cuisine is a mixture of &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Africa\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indian%20cuisine\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creole%20peoples\"&gt;Creole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20cuisine\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; influences. A typical meal consists of a main dish of meat or fish, normally marinated with a mixture of herbs and spices, hot side dishes, and one or more salads. A common Bajan side dish could be pickled cucumber, fish cakes, bake, etc. The meal is usually served with one or more sauces. The &lt;a href=\"national%20dish\"&gt;national dish&lt;/a&gt; of Barbados is &lt;a href=\"cou-cou\"&gt;cou-cou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flying%20fish\"&gt;flying fish&lt;/a&gt; with spicy gravy. Another traditional meal is pudding and souse, a dish of pickled &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt; with spiced sweet potatoes. A wide variety of seafood and meats are also available.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gay%20Rum\"&gt;Mount Gay Rum&lt;/a&gt; visitor's centre in Barbados claims to be the world's oldest remaining rum company, with the earliest confirmed deed from 1703. &lt;a href=\"Cockspur%20Rum\"&gt;Cockspur Rum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20%28rum%29\"&gt;Malibu&lt;/a&gt; are also from the island. Barbados is home to the &lt;a href=\"Banks%20Barbados%20Brewery\"&gt;Banks Barbados Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, which brews Banks Beer, a &lt;a href=\"pale%20lager\"&gt;pale lager&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Banks &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ale\"&gt;Amber Ale&lt;/a&gt;. Banks also brews Tiger Malt, a non-alcoholic &lt;a href=\"malta\"&gt;malted beverage&lt;/a&gt;. 10 Saints beer is brewed in &lt;a href=\"Speightstown\"&gt;Speightstown&lt;/a&gt;, St. Peter in Barbados and aged for 90 days in Mount Gay 'Special Reserve' Rum casks. It was first brewed in 2009 and is available in certain Caricom nations.\nSports.\nAs in other Caribbean countries of British colonial heritage, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; is very popular on the island. The &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20cricket%20team\"&gt;West Indies cricket team&lt;/a&gt; usually includes several Barbadian players. In addition to several warm-up matches and six \"Super Eight\" matches, the country hosted the final of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2007 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Barbados has produced many great cricketers including &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Garfield%20Sobers\"&gt;Sir Garfield Sobers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Frank%20Worrell\"&gt;Sir Frank Worrell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Clyde%20Walcott\"&gt;Sir Clyde Walcott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Everton%20Weekes\"&gt;Sir Everton Weekes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Greenidge\"&gt;Gordon Greenidge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Hall\"&gt;Wes Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Griffith\"&gt;Charlie Griffith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Garner\"&gt;Joel Garner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Haynes\"&gt;Desmond Haynes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Marshall\"&gt;Malcolm Marshall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Track%20and%20Field\"&gt;Track and Field&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Obadele%20Thompson\"&gt;Obadele Thompson&lt;/a&gt; won a bronze medal in the &lt;a href=\"100m\"&gt;100m&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;2000 Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; He's the first and only Bajan to win a Olympic medal. He is also the only Bajan to run sub 10 and sub 20 over 100m and &lt;a href=\"200m\"&gt;200m&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Brathwaite\"&gt;Ryan Brathwaite&lt;/a&gt; won a &lt;a href=\"gold%20medal\"&gt;gold medal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"110%20metres%20hurdles\"&gt;110 metres hurdles&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;2009 World Championships in Athletics&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union\"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is also popular in Barbados.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse%20racing\"&gt;Horse racing&lt;/a&gt; takes place at the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Savannah%20Racetrack\"&gt;Historic Garrison Savannah&lt;/a&gt; close to Bridgetown. Spectators can pay for admission to the stands, or else can watch races from the public \"rail\", which encompasses the track.\n&lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; is an increasingly popular sport, played at school or college. &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Barbados's national team&lt;/a&gt; has shown some unexpected results as in the past it beat many much larger countries.\n&lt;a href=\"Polo\"&gt;Polo&lt;/a&gt; is very popular amongst the rich elite on the island and the \"High-Goal\" Apes Hill team is based at the St James's Club. It is also played at the private &lt;a href=\"Holders%20Festival\"&gt;Holders Festival&lt;/a&gt; ground.\nIn golf, the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Open\"&gt;Barbados Open&lt;/a&gt;, played at Royal Westmoreland Golf Club, was an annual stop on the &lt;a href=\"European%20Seniors%20Tour\"&gt;European Seniors Tour&lt;/a&gt; from 2000 to 2009. In December 2006 the &lt;a href=\"WGC-World%20Cup\"&gt;WGC-World Cup&lt;/a&gt; took place at the country's &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Lane%20%28resort%29\"&gt;Sandy Lane&lt;/a&gt; resort on the Country Club course, an 18-hole course designed by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Fazio\"&gt;Tom Fazio&lt;/a&gt;. The Barbados Golf Club is another course on the island. It has hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.\n&lt;a href=\"Volleyball\"&gt;Volleyball&lt;/a&gt; is also popular and is mainly played indoors.\n&lt;a href=\"Tennis\"&gt;Tennis&lt;/a&gt; is gaining popularity and Barbados is home to &lt;a href=\"Darian%20King\"&gt;Darian King&lt;/a&gt;, who has achieved a career-high ranking of 106 in May 2017 and has played in the &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20singles\"&gt;2016 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2017%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2017 US Open&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Motorsports\"&gt;Motorsports&lt;/a&gt; also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar. Also, the &lt;a href=\"Bushy%20Park%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Bushy Park Circuit&lt;/a&gt; hosted the &lt;a href=\"Race%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Race of Champions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Global%20RallyCross%20Championship\"&gt;Global RallyCross Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nThe presence of the trade winds along with favourable swells make the southern tip of the island an ideal location for wave sailing (an extreme form of the sport of &lt;a href=\"windsurfing\"&gt;windsurfing&lt;/a&gt;).\nBarbados also hosts several international surfing competitions.\n&lt;a href=\"Netball\"&gt;Netball&lt;/a&gt; is also popular with women in Barbados.\nSeveral players in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) are from Barbados, including &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Bailey%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Robert Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Farmer\"&gt;Roger Farmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Joseph\"&gt;Elvis Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Seale\"&gt;Sam Seale&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport.\nAlthough Barbados is about across at its widest point, a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip (south-east) to North Point in St. Lucy (north-central) can take one and a half hours or longer due to traffic. Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens. In Barbados, drivers drive on the left side of the road.\nBarbados is known for its many roundabouts. One famous roundabout is a roundabout located east of Bridgetown, where you will see an emancipation statue of a slave named &lt;a href=\"Bussa%27s%20rebellion\"&gt;Bussa&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport on the island is relatively convenient with \"&lt;a href=\"share%20taxis\"&gt;route taxis&lt;/a&gt;\" called \"&lt;a href=\"ZR%20%28bus%29\"&gt;ZRs&lt;/a&gt;\" (pronounced \"Zed-Rs\") travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down regardless of the number. They will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital &lt;a href=\"Bridgetown\"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=\"Speightstown%2C%20Barbados\"&gt;Speightstown&lt;/a&gt; in the northern part of the island.\nIncluding the ZRs, there are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays). There are ZRs, the yellow minibuses and the blue &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Transport%20Board\"&gt;Transport Board buses&lt;/a&gt;. A ride on any of them costs . The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems (\"ZRs\" and \"minibuses\") can give change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Transport%20Board\"&gt;Barbados Transport Board&lt;/a&gt; system cannot, but do give receipts. The Barbados Transport Board buses travel in regular bus routes and scheduled timetables across Barbados. Schoolchildren in school uniform including some Secondary schools ride for free on the government buses and for on the ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Barbados Transport Board's headquarters are located at Kay's House, Roebuck Street, St. Michael, and the bus depots and terminals are located in the Fairchild Street Bus Terminal in Fairchild Street and the Princess Alice Bus Terminal (which was formerly the Lower Green Bus Terminal in Jubilee Gardens, Bridgetown, St. Michael) in Princess Alice Highway, Bridgetown, St. Michael; the Speightstown Bus Terminal in Speightstown, St. Peter; the Oistins Bus Depot in Oistins, Christ Church; and the Mangrove Bus Depot in Mangrove, St. Philip. In July 2020, the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Transport%20Board\"&gt;Barbados Transport Board&lt;/a&gt; received 33 &lt;a href=\"BYD%20Auto\"&gt;BYD&lt;/a&gt; electric buses which were obtained not only to add to the aging fleet of diesel buses but also to assist the Government in their goal of eliminating the use of fossil fuels by the year 2030.\nSome hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.\nThe island's lone airport is the &lt;a href=\"Grantley%20Adams%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Grantley Adams International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. In the first decade of the 21st century it underwent a upgrade and expansion in February 2003 until completion in August 2005.\nThe island also has a sea port which is the primary port of call for commercial container and cruise traffic.\nThere was also a helicopter shuttle service, which offered air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic was regulated by the &lt;a href=\"Barbados%20Port%20Authority\"&gt;Barbados Port Authority&lt;/a&gt;."
