    "text": "Palayankottai (also Palamcottah) is a neighbourhood in &lt;a href=\"Tirunelveli\"&gt;Tirunelveli City&lt;/a&gt;, India that is part of the &lt;a href=\"Tirunelveli%20Municipal%20Corporation\"&gt;Tirunelveli City Municipal Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. It is on the east bank of the &lt;a href=\"Thamirabarani%20river\"&gt;Thamirabarani river&lt;/a&gt;, excepting its downtown area, which is on the west bank.\nEtymology.\nThe archaic word \"Palayankottai\" in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; means a small administrative region or district. A \"Kottai\" is a fort. The &lt;a href=\"portmanteau\"&gt;portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; Tamil word Palayankottai was hence derived historically from an ancient fort that was in the centre of the region. Today, the fort lies in ruins and is almost camouflaged by its surrounding old residential edifices. To anyone who reads about Palayankottai for the first time, it may be surprising to see that atlases and other books refer to the city with both, an M or an N (Palayamkottai or Palayankottai). This uncertainty is because the actual Tamil word for the city uses an alphabet that is phonetically between M and N, and sometimes even completely substituted by G (\"pronounced Palayangkottai in colloquial Tamil\"). Natively speaking, it is hence correctly pronounced as Palayamnkottai. Historically during the British Raj, the area was referred to as Palancottah and also Palamkottah. The anglicization of the word was dropped by the locals immediately after independence, and the city is now called both Palayankottai and Palayamkottai according to official government documents and records. For disambiguation, the city is referred to as Palayankottai in this article.\nGeography.\nTirunelveli and Palayamkottai are called as Twin city. Prior to 1994, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai used to be two independent municipalities. In 1994, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai along with surrounding areas were merged and formed &lt;a href=\"Tirunelveli\"&gt;Tirunelveli City&lt;/a&gt; administered by &lt;a href=\"Tirunelveli%20Municipal%20Corporation\"&gt;Tirunelveli Municipal Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Palayamkottai is situated on the eastern bank of the perennial &lt;a href=\"Thamirabarani%20river\"&gt;Thamirabarani river&lt;/a&gt;. The region is very fertile and supports a thriving agrarian community in the midst of many urbanized areas. Regular monsoon rains coupled with the Thamirabarani water, support the purely agricultural villages around the city. Palayamkottai is located on the National Highway in close proximity to many bigger cities (international seaport: &lt;a href=\"Tuticorin\"&gt;Tuticorin&lt;/a&gt; - 45\u00a0km; international airports: &lt;a href=\"Trivandrum\"&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt; - 140\u00a0km, &lt;a href=\"Madurai\"&gt;Madurai&lt;/a&gt; - 150\u00a0 km; domestic airport: &lt;a href=\"Tuticorin\"&gt;Tuticorin&lt;/a&gt; - 25\u00a0km) hence supporting trade and commerce.\nLandmarks.\nMajor localities in Palayamkottai are Vannarapettai, Murugankuruchi, Market, Samathanapuram, Rahmathnagar, Perumalpuram, Maharaja nagar, High Grounds, VM Chatram and KTC Nagar and posh town called Santhi Nagar out of which Vannarpettai, Murugankurichi and Market are concentrated with largely commercial activities. There are also several other minor suburban areas which collectively contribute to the overall cityscape of Palayamkottai.\nThe little city also has a Government Museum with a huge and realistic fibreglass \"&lt;a href=\"Tyrannosaurus\"&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/a&gt;\" which is popular among the young people of Palayamkottai. The museum houses a small collection of ancient artifacts found in the areas surrounding the city. Some of its literary collections include ancient Tamil inscriptions in palm leaves.\nPalayamkottai also has one of the most popular Science Centres in South India, a satellite unit of Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, &lt;a href=\"Bangalore\"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Science Centre lies between Palayamkottai and Tirunelveli (the twin cities) and as it is difficult to mark a border between the two, it is often called as the Tirunelveli District Science Centre (by the district's name). It is a common hangout area for young people, and is frequently visited by teams of school students to explore and learn the principles of science through the centre's interesting outdoor equipment and experiments.\nHospitals.\nPalayamkottai has many &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;s and other medical facilities. Among them, Our Lady's Hospital, founded nearly 50 years ago by a Belgian nun called Sister Delphine Bruyndonx, was and still remains one of Palayamkottai's popular hospitals for people who are poor or disadvantaged. Sister Delphine was popularly called the \"Teresa of Tirunelveli\" by all the people who knew her, because she had served this society since a time when it did not have any electricity.\nCSI Bell Pins Mission Hospital and the recently renovated CSI Jeyaraj Annapackiam Hospital in Palayamkottai provide free and reduced cost medical services to the local community. The Tirunelveli Medical college Hospital - a tertiary referral center, located in the High Grounds provides free services to poor people. Palayamkottai also has a specialized kidney care centre and heart surgery centre. The city also has four blood banks: Shifa hospitals, Aarthi, Bethel and at Government Medical college hospital.\nSports.\nPalayamkottai has many playgrounds filled with hyperactive young cricketers.

Grand celebrations during the Republic day and Independence day are conducted by various schools in the &lt;a href=\"V.%20O.%20Chidambaram%20Pillai\"&gt;VOC&lt;/a&gt; ground. State Level Hockey tournaments sponsored by Bell Pins are held in VOC grounds annually. A park and an indoor stadium has been built here in this ground, in order to cover the small children and youngsters. The Anna Stadium holds &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kabbadi\"&gt;Kabbadi&lt;/a&gt; matches at both district and state level. The stadium has an excellent professional German Hockey Turf, which trains a lot of young and energetic teams and Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) has recently released tenders for installation of synthetic athletic track in it. The stadium also houses a well maintained swimming pool.\nMarkets, shops and supermarkets.\nThere is a big market in central Palayamkottai, serviced by many bus routes. Also very popular among locals, is the &lt;a href=\"Uzhavar%20Santhai\"&gt;Ulavar Santhai&lt;/a&gt; where farmers sell their products directly. The produce is very fresh and very cheap, and the market is usually very crowded in the morning with eager housewives exercising their haggling skills with the illiterate farmers. The success of the &lt;a href=\"Uzhavar%20Santhai\"&gt;Ulavar Santhai&lt;/a&gt; market in Palayamkottai was under a deep speculation during the changing of governments. Now, with the ruling party DMK back in power, (which originally introduced the concept) the Ulavar Santhai is maintained well and is a grocery market for the locals.\nSupermarkets like Aryaas Supermarket have revolutionized shopping in Palayamkottai by bringing all homeneeds into a common commercial zone. Although there are not many supermarkets in Palayamkottai, there are practically all kinds of shops catering to the local people's needs.

RMKV and Colors are frequented by people for purchase of clothes and readymade garments. Eagle Book Centre, Shyamala book centre and Velavan are exclusive choices for good books and stationery. RMKV and Baby's Gallery cater to the needs of the kids segment. The entry of big players like &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bazaar\"&gt;Big Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; and Reliance Hypermall further promotes the economical status of Palayamkottai. Palayamkottai being a small city, brings a visitor back to square one in terms of shopping for quality goods.\nPublic Services.\nPalayamkottai has schools for the blind, deaf and mentally handicapped children. These organizations are predominantly run by the Tirunelveli Diocese of Church of South India, and are:\nLeprosy missions, orphanages and medical missions are also very active organizations in Palayamkottai\nPalayamkottai also has an efficient fire-fighting service which conducts camps in local schools annually.

The regular yellow-black Greaves Garuda autorickshaws, although plenty in number, are considered to be the common man's taxis of Palayamkottai. Autorickshaw drivers are known to overcharge tourists. Cars as taxis, are generally only available in taxi stands where tourists and locals use them to travel to short distances outside of the city. As a common practise, people of Palayamkottai or Tirunelveli do not use taxis as an alternate public transportation to buses or trains. Ola taxis have gained popularity with other private taxis as they are cheap than autos.\nReligion.\nThe city has several &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; temples: The Gopalaswamy Temple, Siva Temple known as Thiripuraanthakaeshwarar temple, Ramar Temple, and Amman (goddess) temples. &lt;a href=\"Navratri\"&gt;Dasara&lt;/a&gt; is a Hindu festival is celebrated in this region.\nThe renovation of the lord Gopalaswamy temple was completed by the Government of Tamil Nadu recently.
