    "text": "Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (; ; ) was a Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romantic&lt;/a&gt; era. He is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern &lt;a href=\"Russian%20literature\"&gt;Russian literature&lt;/a&gt;.\nPushkin was born into &lt;a href=\"Russian%20nobility\"&gt;Russian nobility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to Pushkin noble families. His maternal great-grandfather was Central-African-born general &lt;a href=\"Abram%20Petrovich%20Gannibal\"&gt;Abram Petrovich Gannibal&lt;/a&gt;. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo%20Lyceum\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum&lt;/a&gt;. Upon graduation from the Lyc\u00e9e, Pushkin recited his controversial poem \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20to%20Liberty%20%28poem%29\"&gt;Ode to Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander I&lt;/a&gt;. While under the strict surveillance of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Section%20of%20His%20Imperial%20Majesty%27s%20Own%20Chancellery\"&gt;Tsar's political police&lt;/a&gt; and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Boris%20Godunov%20%28play%29\"&gt;Boris Godunov&lt;/a&gt;\". His novel in verse, \"&lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Onegin\"&gt;Eugene Onegin&lt;/a&gt;\", was serialized between 1825 and 1832.\nPushkin was fatally wounded in a &lt;a href=\"duel\"&gt;duel&lt;/a&gt; with his wife's alleged lover and her sister's husband &lt;a href=\"Georges-Charles%20de%20Heeckeren%20d%27Anth%C3%A8s\"&gt;Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the &lt;a href=\"Chevalier%20Guard%20Regiment\"&gt;Chevalier Guard Regiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncestry.\nPushkin's father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767\u20131848), was descended from a distinguished family of the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century. Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda (Nadya) Ossipovna Gannibal (1775\u20131836), was descended through her paternal grandmother from German and Scandinavian nobility. She was the daughter of Ossip Abramovich Gannibal (1744\u20131807) and his wife, Maria Alekseyevna Pushkina (1745\u20131818).\nOssip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was &lt;a href=\"Abram%20Petrovich%20Gannibal\"&gt;Abram Petrovich Gannibal&lt;/a&gt; (1696\u20131781), an African &lt;a href=\"Page%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped to &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; as a gift to the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Sultan\"&gt;Ottoman Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and later transferred to Russia as a gift for &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of \"Lagon\". Largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law Rotkirkh, some historians concluded from this that Gannibal was born in a village called Geza-Lamza in the &lt;a href=\"Seraye\"&gt;Seraye&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Mdre%20Bahri\"&gt;Mdre Bahri&lt;/a&gt; kingdom in todays &lt;a href=\"Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Nabokov\"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, when researching \"&lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Onegin\"&gt;Eugene Onegin&lt;/a&gt;\", cast serious doubt on this origin theory. Later research by the scholars &lt;a href=\"Dieudonn%C3%A9%20Gnammankou\"&gt;Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Barnes\"&gt;Hugh Barnes&lt;/a&gt; eventually conclusively established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;. After education in France as a &lt;a href=\"military%20engineer\"&gt;military engineer&lt;/a&gt;, Gannibal became governor of &lt;a href=\"Tallinn\"&gt;Reval&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Russian%20military%20ranks\"&gt;G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Chef&lt;/a&gt; (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and was more attached to than to his own mother. He published his first poem at the age of 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo%20Lyceum\"&gt;Imperial Lyceum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. At the Lyceum, he was a student of David Mara, known in Russia as , a younger brother of French revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Marat\"&gt;Jean-Paul Marat&lt;/a&gt;. At After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of St. Petersburg, which was then the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In 1820, he published his first long poem, \"&lt;a href=\"Ruslan%20and%20Ludmila\"&gt;Ruslan and Ludmila&lt;/a&gt;\", with much controversy about its subject and style.\nSocial activism.\nWhile at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; individualist teachings of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem \"19 October\". Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, particularly &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Diderot\"&gt;Diderot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voltaire\"&gt;Voltaire&lt;/a&gt;, whom he described as \"the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history\".\nPushkin gradually became committed to social reform, and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820. He went to the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Crimea\"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href=\"Kamianka%2C%20Cherkasy%20Oblast\"&gt;Kamianka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, where he became a &lt;a href=\"Freemason\"&gt;Freemason&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe joined the &lt;a href=\"Filiki%20Eteria\"&gt;Filiki Eteria&lt;/a&gt;, a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Revolution\"&gt;Greek Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and when the war against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turks\"&gt;Ottoman Turks&lt;/a&gt; broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.\nRise.\nHe stayed in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 1823 and wrote two &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romantic&lt;/a&gt; poems, which brought him acclaim: \"The Captive of the Caucasus\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fountain%20of%20Bakhchisaray\"&gt;The Fountain of Bakhchisaray&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1823, Pushkin moved to &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, where he again clashed with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother's rural estate of &lt;a href=\"Mikhaylovskoye%20Museum%20Reserve\"&gt;Mikhailovskoye&lt;/a&gt; (near Pskov) from 1824 to 1826.\nIn Mikhaylovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, wife of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Russia\"&gt;Malorossia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"General-Governor\"&gt;General-Governor&lt;/a&gt;. Then Pushkin worked on his verse-novel \"Eugene Onegin\".\nIn Mikhaylovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem \"To***\". It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Petrovna%20Kern\"&gt;Anna Kern&lt;/a&gt;, but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova. &lt;a href=\"Pushkin%20studies\"&gt;Pushkinist&lt;/a&gt; Kira Victorova believed that the poem was dedicated to the Empress Elizaveta Alekseyevna. Vadim Nikolayev argued that the idea about the Empress was marginal and refused to discuss it, while trying to prove that poem had been dedicated to Tatyana Larina, the heroine of \"Eugene Onegin\".\nAuthorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20to%20Liberty%20%28poem%29\"&gt;Ode to Liberty&lt;/a&gt;\" was found among the belongings of the rebels from the &lt;a href=\"Decembrist%20revolt\"&gt;Decembrist Uprising&lt;/a&gt; (1825). After his exile in 1820, Pushkin's friends and family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting with &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Alexander I&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt; on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Upon meeting with &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt;, Pushkin obtained his release from exile and began to work as the tsar's Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems, the tsar retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was banned from travelling at will.\nDuring that same year (1825), Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Boris%20Godunov%20%28play%29\"&gt;Boris Godunov&lt;/a&gt;\", while at his mother's estate. He could not however, gain permission to publish it until five years later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.\nAround 1825\u20131829 he met and befriended the Polish poet &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Mickiewicz\"&gt;Adam Mickiewicz&lt;/a&gt;, during exile in central Russia. In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt; to visit friends fighting in the Russian army during the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281828%E2%80%9329%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;. In the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire reflected in his poem \"\u041f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c, \u044f \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432; \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f...\" He applied for permission for the journey, but received negative response from &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt;, on 17 January 1830.\nAround 1828, Pushkin met &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Pushkina\"&gt;Natalia Goncharova&lt;/a&gt;, then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of &lt;a href=\"cholera\"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ascension%20Church\"&gt;Great Ascension Church&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bolshaya%20Nikitskaya%20Street\"&gt;Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow. When the &lt;a href=\"Tsar\"&gt;Tsar&lt;/a&gt; gave Pushkin the lowest court title, Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could properly attend court balls.\nIn the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other great early writers, &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Gogol\"&gt;Nikolai Gogol&lt;/a&gt;. After reading Gogol's 1831\u20131832 volume of short stories \"&lt;a href=\"Evenings%20on%20a%20Farm%20Near%20Dikanka\"&gt;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&lt;/a&gt;\", Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Sovremennik\"&gt;The Contemporary&lt;/a&gt;\", which he founded in 1836.\nDeath.\nBy the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November he sent a challenge to a duel to &lt;a href=\"Georges-Charles%20de%20Heeckeren%20d%27Anth%C3%A8s\"&gt;Georges d'Anth\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Dantes-Gekkern. &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20van%20Heeckeren%20tot%20Enghuizen\"&gt;Jacob van Heeckeren&lt;/a&gt;, d'Anth\u00e8s' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled.\nOn 17 November d'Anth\u00e8s made a proposal to Natalia Goncharova's sister \u2013 Ekaterina Goncharova. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. Georges d'Anth\u00e8s continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public, and rumours that d'Anth\u00e8s had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation circulated.\nOn 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) of 1837, Pushkin sent a \"highly insulting letter\" to Gekkern. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anth\u00e8s, on the same day through the attach\u00e9 of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac.\nPushkin asked &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Magenis\"&gt;Arthur Magenis&lt;/a&gt;, then attach\u00e9 to the &lt;a href=\"Consulate-General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept, but on 26 January (7 February), approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however, d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning, declining to be his second as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.\nThe pistol duel with d'Anth\u00e8s took place on 27 January (8 February) at the &lt;a href=\"Chernaya%20River%20%28Saint%20Petersburg%29\"&gt;Black River&lt;/a&gt;, without the presence of a second for Pushkin. The duel they fought was of a kind known as a \"barrier duel\". The rules of this type dictated that the duellists began at an agreed distance. After the signal to begin, they walked towards each other, closing the distance. They could fire at any time they wished, but the duellist that shot first was required to stand still and wait for the other to shoot back at his leisure.\nD'Anth\u00e8s fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D'Anth\u00e8s was only lightly wounded in the right arm by Pushkin's shot. Two days later, on 29 January (10 February) at 14:45, Pushkin died of &lt;a href=\"peritonitis\"&gt;peritonitis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Pushkin's wife's request, he was put in the coffin in evening dress \u2013 not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the tsar. The funeral service was initially assigned to the St. Isaac's Cathedral, but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral, the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Alexander Pushkin was buried on the grounds of the Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day &lt;a href=\"Pushkinskiye%20Gory\"&gt;Pushkinskiye Gory&lt;/a&gt;, near Pskov, beside his mother. His last home is now a &lt;a href=\"National%20Pushkin%20Museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescendants.\nPushkin had four children from his marriage to Natalia: Maria (b. 1832), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835) and Natalia (b. 1836), the last of whom married &lt;a href=\"morganatic%20marriage\"&gt;morganatically&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Nikolaus%20Wilhelm%20of%20Nassau\"&gt;Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nassau-Weilburg\"&gt;House of Nassau-Weilburg&lt;/a&gt;) and was granted the title of &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Merenberg\"&gt;Countess of Merenberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly the lines of Alexander and Natalia still remain. Natalia's granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Nadejda%20Mountbatten%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Milford%20Haven\"&gt;Nadejda&lt;/a&gt;, married into the extended British royal family (her husband was the uncle of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;). Descendants of the poet now live around the globe in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United States.\nLegacy.\nLiterary.\nCritics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bronze%20Horseman%20%28poem%29\"&gt;The Bronze Horseman&lt;/a&gt;\" and the drama \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20Guest%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Stone Guest&lt;/a&gt;\", a tale of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Don%20Juan\"&gt;Don Juan&lt;/a&gt;. His poetic short drama \"&lt;a href=\"Mozart%20and%20Salieri%20%28play%29\"&gt;Mozart and Salieri&lt;/a&gt;\" (like \"The Stone Guest\", one of the so-called four \"Little Tragedies\", a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Pletnyov\"&gt;Pyotr Pletnyov&lt;/a&gt;) was the inspiration for &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Shaffer\"&gt;Peter Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Amadeus%20%28play%29\"&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov\"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"&lt;a href=\"Mozart%20and%20Salieri%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Mozart and Salieri&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Belkin%20Tales\"&gt;The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin&lt;/a&gt;\", including \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shot%20%28Pushkin%29\"&gt;The Shot&lt;/a&gt;\", were well received. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, \"the narrative logic and the plausibility of that which is narrated, together with the precision, conciseness \u2013 economy of the presentation of reality \u2013 all of the above is achieved in \"Tales of Belkin\", especially, and most of all in the story \"The Stationmaster\". Pushkin is the progenitor of the long and fruitful development of Russian realist literature, for he manages to attain the realist ideal of a concise presentation of reality\". Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel \"&lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Onegin\"&gt;Eugene Onegin&lt;/a&gt;\", which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.\n\"Onegin\" is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Nabokov\"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like &lt;a href=\"Henry%20James\"&gt;Henry James&lt;/a&gt;.\nPushkin wrote \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Queen%20of%20Spades%20%28story%29\"&gt;The Queen of Spades&lt;/a&gt;\", a short story frequently anthologized in English translation.\nMusical.\nPushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Glinka\"&gt;Glinka&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ruslan%20and%20Lyudmila%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Ruslan and Lyudmila&lt;/a&gt;\" is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;'s operas \"&lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Onegin%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Eugene Onegin&lt;/a&gt;\" (1879) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Queen%20of%20Spades%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Queen of Spades&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Pikovaya Dama\", 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.\n&lt;a href=\"Modest%20Mussorgsky\"&gt;Mussorgsky&lt;/a&gt;'s monumental \"&lt;a href=\"Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Boris Godunov&lt;/a&gt;\" (two versions, 1868\u20139 and 1871\u20132) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.\nOther Russian operas based on Pushkin include &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Dargomyzhsky\"&gt;Dargomyzhsky&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Rusalka%20%28Dargomyzhsky%29\"&gt;Rusalka&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20Guest%20%28Dargomyzhsky%29\"&gt;The Stone Guest&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov\"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mozart%20and%20Salieri%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Mozart and Salieri&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tale%20of%20Tsar%20Saltan%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29\"&gt;Tale of Tsar Saltan&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Cockerel\"&gt;The Golden Cockerel&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Cui\"&gt;Cui&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20of%20the%20Caucasus%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Prisoner of the Caucasus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Feast%20in%20Time%20of%20Plague%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Feast in Time of Plague&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Captain%27s%20Daughter%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Captain's Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mazeppa%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Mazeppa&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Rachmaninoff\"&gt;Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt;'s one-act operas \"&lt;a href=\"Aleko%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Aleko&lt;/a&gt;\" (based on \"The Gypsies\") and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Miserly%20Knight\"&gt;The Miserly Knight&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Stravinsky\"&gt;Stravinsky&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mavra\"&gt;Mavra&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20N%C3%A1pravn%C3%ADk\"&gt;N\u00e1pravn\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Dubrovsky%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Dubrovsky&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAdditionally, ballets and &lt;a href=\"cantata\"&gt;cantata&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as innumerable &lt;a href=\"Art%20song\"&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt;, have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in &lt;a href=\"Isabelle%20Aboulker\"&gt;Isabelle Aboulker&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"song%20cycle\"&gt;song cycle&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Troika%20%28album%29\"&gt;Caprice \u00e9trange&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Franz%20von%20Supp%C3%A9\"&gt;Supp\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruggiero%20Leoncavallo\"&gt;Leoncavallo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Francesco%20Malipiero\"&gt;Malipiero&lt;/a&gt; have also based operas on his works. Composers &lt;a href=\"Yevgania%20Yosifovna%20Yakhina\"&gt;Yevgania Yosifovna Yakhina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Semyonovna%20Zavalishina\"&gt;Maria Semyonovna Zavalishina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zinaida%20Petrovna%20Ziberova\"&gt;Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova&lt;/a&gt; composed folk songs using Pushkin's text.\n\"The Desire of Glory\", which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by &lt;a href=\"David%20Tukhmanov\"&gt;David Tukhmanov&lt;/a&gt; ), as well as \"Keep Me, Mine Talisman\" \u2013 by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Barykin\"&gt;Alexander Barykin&lt;/a&gt; ) and later by Tukhmanov.\nRomanticism.\nPushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature although he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Neoclassicism&lt;/a&gt; through Romanticism to &lt;a href=\"Literary%20realism\"&gt;Realism&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative assessment suggests that \"he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic\" and that \"he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic\".\nRussian literature.\nPushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised &lt;a href=\"calque\"&gt;calque&lt;/a&gt;s. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Nabokov\"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, Pushkin's &lt;a href=\"idiom\"&gt;idiom&lt;/a&gt; combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from &lt;a href=\"Gavrila%20Derzhavin\"&gt;Derzhavin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Zhukovsky\"&gt;Zhukovsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Konstantin%20Batyushkov\"&gt;Batyushkov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikolay%20Karamzin\"&gt;Karamzin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Krylov\"&gt;Krylov&lt;/a&gt;:\nHis work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the \"Sovremennik\" (\"The Contemporary\", or \"\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\"). Pushkin inspired the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20fairy%20tale\"&gt;folk tales&lt;/a&gt; and genre pieces of other authors: &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Leskov\"&gt;Leskov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Yesenin\"&gt;Yesenin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Gorky\"&gt;Gorky&lt;/a&gt;. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Turgenev\"&gt;Ivan Turgenev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Goncharov\"&gt;Ivan Goncharov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Tolstoy\"&gt;Leo Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Lermontov\"&gt;Mikhail Lermontov&lt;/a&gt;. Pushkin was analysed by &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Gogol\"&gt;Nikolai Gogol&lt;/a&gt;, his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic &lt;a href=\"Vissarion%20Belinsky\"&gt;Vissarion Belinsky&lt;/a&gt;, who produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\nSoviet centennial celebrations.\nThe centennial year of Pushkin's death, 1937, was one of the most significant Soviet-era literary centennials in Stalinist Russia, rivaled only by the 1928 centennial commemorating &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Tolstoy\"&gt;Leo Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt;'s birth. Despite the public display of visage on ever present billboards and candy wrappers, Pushkin's \"image\" conflicted with that of the ideal Soviet (he was reputed as a &lt;a href=\"libertine\"&gt;libertine&lt;/a&gt; with unrepentant aristocratic tendencies) and was subject to a repressive revisionism, similar to the Stalinist state's clean up of Tolstoy's &lt;a href=\"Christian%20anarchism\"&gt;Christian anarchism&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks.\n[Not including the short poems, of which there are dozens.]"
