    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo Garc\u00eda (June 29, 1912 \u2013 June 16, 1958) was a &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20people\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; pianist, percussionist, music teacher, &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conducting\"&gt;conductor&lt;/a&gt;. \"As composer, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo represents one of the most important legacies of the Mexican nationalism in art music, after &lt;a href=\"Silvestre%20Revueltas\"&gt;Silvestre Revueltas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Ch%C3%A1vez\"&gt;Carlos Ch\u00e1vez&lt;/a&gt;.\" He produced some of the masterworks that best symbolize the essence of the national aspirations and contradictions of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in the 20th century.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara%2C%20Jalisco\"&gt;Guadalajara, Jalisco&lt;/a&gt;, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo was introduced to music by his elder brother Francisco. &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20Moncada\"&gt;Eduardo Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada&lt;/a&gt; is reported as the first teacher of Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo in 1926, when the teenager was fourteen years old. According to Aurelio Tello, Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada suggested his pupil Moncayo study at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Conservatory%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;National Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. Tello reports that Moncayo was admitted to the conservatory in 1929; meanwhile, in order to finance his studies, he worked as a jazz pianist. According to the research of Torres-Chibr\u00e1s, Moncayo took composition lessons with Candelario Hu\u00edzar, and continued his piano instruction with Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada. It is not certain in which courses Moncayo registered at the conservatory and who his other teachers were, but thanks to the biographies of his contemporaries &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Contreras\"&gt;Salvador Contreras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blas%20Galindo\"&gt;Blas Galindo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Ayala%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Daniel Ayala&lt;/a&gt; we may assume that Moncayo followed a similar path during his instruction at the National Conservatory. Hu\u00edzar taught courses such as harmony, counterpoint and analysis (also called musical forms). Solf\u00e8ge or sight reading was taught by the eminent professors &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20T.%20Mendoza\"&gt;Vicente T. Mendoza&lt;/a&gt; and Ger\u00f3nimo Baqueiro Foster. Music history was taught by Ernesto Enr\u00edquez. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Sandi\"&gt;Luis Sandi&lt;/a&gt; was the conductor of the conservatory chorale and Eduardo Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada, the associate conductor. In different periods Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada taught, in addition to his piano lessons, harmony, sight reading, and later, opera ensembles. Jos\u00e9 Rol\u00f3n, who had studied under &lt;a href=\"Nadia%20Boulanger\"&gt;Nadia Boulanger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dukas\"&gt;Paul Dukas&lt;/a&gt; in Paris (and also met &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Schoenberg\"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/a&gt;), taught harmony, counterpoint and fugue. Ch\u00e1vez was highly concerned with the general education and culture of the conservatory students and established literature courses taught by the contemporary poets &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Novo\"&gt;Salvador Novo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Pellicer\"&gt;Carlos Pellicer&lt;/a&gt;, world history by Jes\u00fas C. Romero, and history of Mexican culture by Agust\u00edn Loera and Ch\u00e1vez himself.\nAccording to Salvador Contreras, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Ch%C3%A1vez\"&gt;Carlos Ch\u00e1vez&lt;/a&gt; created a composition course at the National Conservatory. Although &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Morillo\"&gt;Roberto Garc\u00eda Morillo&lt;/a&gt; points out the year 1930, most sources agreed that this course started in 1931. According to Robert L. Parker, this new composition class was originally called Class of Musical Creation and later, Composition Workshop; Ch\u00e1vez had some colleagues as pupils, such as Vicente T. Mendoza, Candelario Hu\u00edzar and Revueltas, and \"there were four students under twenty years of age: Daniel Ayala and Blas Galindo (both pure blooded Indians), Salvador Contreras and Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo.\" Jes\u00fas C. Romero suggests that Ch\u00e1vez conducted a selection process among young students of the conservatory before admitting anyone and relates that Daniel Ayala was chosen thanks to his \"incipient renown as composer, Salvador Contreras, for his violin skills, and Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo, on account of his ability to do sight reading at the piano.\" Furthermore, Romero reports that Blas Galindo was admitted the following year together with five other students. It seems that the new composition course attracted many students, their number increasing year after year, but only four of them attended the final examination. These four diligent students were Moncayo, Contreras, Galindo and Ayala. An article written by Galindo confirms his admittance to the course in 1932, together with seven other students. The article offers a detailed account of the training received at Ch\u00e1vez's workshop.\nAt the first performance of the Renovation Musical Society (Sociedad Musical \"Renovaci\u00f3n\")on August 22, 1931, Moncayo presents a couple of his own compositions, \"Impressions in a Forest\", and \"Impression\", both for solo piano. An opportunity of professional advancement for Moncayo in 1932 was his admission to the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (OSM). The first program of the season of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico dated 28 October 1932, lists the name of Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo for the first time as a member of the orchestra's percussion section.\nDuring the fall of 1932, Ch\u00e1vez organized a festival of chamber music at the National Conservatory and invited his friend &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Copland\"&gt;Aaron Copland&lt;/a&gt; to participate in it. The friendship between Ch\u00e1vez and Copland was extended to Revueltas as well, as described by Eduardo Contreras Soto, revealing that Revueltas also exchanged correspondence with the American composer. Moncayo and Galindo, both incipient proteges of Ch\u00e1vez, also started a long and fruitful relationship with Copland. Next year, Moncayo got a part-time job as music teacher in a school (16 May 1933).\nMexican newspapers reported that on 1 December 1934, the new president of Mexico, General &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1zaro%20C%C3%A1rdenas\"&gt;L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas&lt;/a&gt;, took the oath of office. There was a change in executive positions in the federal government, and Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez, former dean of the National University, was now appointed Secretary of Education. Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez appointed Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Cota as chief of the Department of Fine Arts; as a result Ch\u00e1vez was removed from the head of the National Conservatory and was replaced by his enemy Estanislao Mej\u00eda. According to Blas Galindo, with the arrival of this new administration the composition workshop was terminated. Consequently, the composition training of Moncayo and his young friends was interrupted. According to Torres-Chibr\u00e1s, \"life was not easy at the conservatory for the four \"orphans\" of Maestro Ch\u00e1vez. Despite all the pressure exerted against them, they overcame all the difficulties, joined forces and emerged as an avant-garde group.\" Blas Galindo reports that they were branded as \"Chavistas\" and blacklisted by the new administration of the Conservatory, to the point of setting obstacles for their registration. They decided to give a first concert with their compositions demonstrating with it the truthfulness of the class of Music Creation that had been suppressed from the study plan of the Conservatory. The four friends agreed to arrange the program with compositions made by them after Ch\u00e1vez's departure from the conservatory. On 25 November 1935, at 8:30 P.M., the first concert of these young composers took place at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20de%20Orientaci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Teatro de Orientaci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. Moncayo premi\u00e8red his Sonatina for solo piano, performed by himself, and premiered as well \"Amatzinac\", for flute and string quartet. His friends collaborated as performers in the following order: Salvador Contreras and Daniel Ayala, violins; Miguel Bautista, viola; Juan Manuel T\u00e9llez Oropeza, violoncello; and Miguel Preciado, as flute soloist. A review from &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Barros%20Serra\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Barros Serra&lt;/a&gt; calls the students \"The Group of Four,\" with the aim to promote the nationalistic spirit of Mexican music. The second time these four young composers joined as a group was in a concert that took place on 26 March 1936, at 8:30 P.M. at the Teatro de Orientaci\u00f3n. They adopted the epithet given to them the previous year in a newspaper review by Jos\u00e9 Barros Serra, the \"Group of Four,\" and this was the first public appearance where they intentionally used it. The Group of Four experienced increasing awareness among Mexican audiences and even some internationalization.\nIn the collection of programs of the year 1936 at library of the National Arts Center, in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo is listed as a member of the percussion section of the controversial &lt;a href=\"National%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;National Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; created in 1935 at the National Conservatory by &lt;a href=\"Estanislao%20Mej%C3%ADa\"&gt;Estanislao Mej\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; and conducted by &lt;a href=\"Silvestre%20Revueltas\"&gt;Silvestre Revueltas&lt;/a&gt; from 1936 on. The OSM programs preserved at the Library of the National Center of the Arts have the program of 5 September 1936, where Moncayo's \"La Adelita\" was premiered by the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico, within the children's concert series, under Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's baton. One week later, on 11 September, Moncayo made his debut as orchestra conductor with the OSM, at the age of 24. During the seventh program of the season, Ch\u00e1vez gave Moncayo the opportunity to conduct the opening work of the evening, the Prelude of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Lohengrin%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lohengrin&lt;/a&gt;\". Ch\u00e1vez conducted the rest of the program that included \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Damoiselle%20%C3%A9lue\"&gt;La Damoiselle \u00e9lue&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Debussy\"&gt;Debussy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29\"&gt;Ninth Symphony&lt;/a&gt;. The same month, in another program of the children's concert series, the one of 26 September 1936, another arrangement by Moncayo, \"La Valentina\", was premiered by the OSM, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Ch%C3%A1vez\"&gt;Carlos Ch\u00e1vez&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1941 Ch\u00e1vez organized a concert of Mexican music with the OSM that included some of the works presented previous year in New York and requested Moncayo and Contreras to write compositions for such program. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alcaraz says that, \"It was Ch\u00e1vez himself who asked Moncayo to write a piece based on popular music of the (Mexican) southeast coast for a concert that he called 'Traditional Mexican Music.' \" \nAccording to the notes prepared by &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Weinstock\"&gt;Herbert Weinstock&lt;/a&gt; for the concerts arranged by Ch\u00e1vez in New York (1940), the program then included a work called \"Huapangos\" by Ger\u00f3nimo Baqueiro Foster. This piece was an orchestral arrangement of several popular dances from the eastern state of Veracruz. In the 1941 program Ch\u00e1vez replaced Baqueiro's \"Huapangos\" with a new work called \"Huapango\", written by Moncayo (a &lt;a href=\"huapango\"&gt;huapango&lt;/a&gt; is a type of Mexican dance). The difference is that Moncayo's \"Huapango\" is not just an arrangement but a legitimate work inspired by the popular music of &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt; (\"El Siquisiri\", \"El Balaj\u00fa\" and \"El Gavilancito\"). Ch\u00e1vez sent Moncayo and Galindo to &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt; for a field exploration about the popular music of the region. Quoted by Moncayo's faithful pupil, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alcaraz, Moncayo reports his experience: \n&lt;a href=\"Blas%20Galindo\"&gt;Blas Galindo&lt;/a&gt; and I went to &lt;a href=\"Alvarado%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Alvarado&lt;/a&gt;, one of the places where folkloric music is preserved in its most pure form; we were collecting melodies, rhythms and instrumentations over several days. The transcription of it was very difficult because the \"huapangueros\" (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way. When I came back to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, I showed the collected material to Candelario Hu\u00edzar; Hu\u00edzar gave me a piece of advice that I will always be grateful for: \"Present the material first in the same way you heard it and develop it later according to your own thought.\" And I did it, and the result is almost satisfactory for me.\n Moncayo's \"Huapango\" was premi\u00e8red on 15 August 1941, at the &lt;a href=\"Palacio%20de%20Bellas%20Artes\"&gt;Palacio de Bellas Artes&lt;/a&gt; by the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico under Ch\u00e1vez's baton. Programs of the 1942 season list &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20Moncada\"&gt;Eduardo Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada&lt;/a&gt; as assistant conductor and Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo at the piano as well as in the percussion section. Moncayo began to work on an ambitious project, a symphony. That summer, and probably thanks to the recommendations of Ch\u00e1vez and Copland, Moncayo and Galindo were granted scholarships from the &lt;a href=\"Rockefeller%20Foundation\"&gt;Rockefeller Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to study at the Berkshire Music Institute, known today as the &lt;a href=\"Tanglewood%20Music%20Center\"&gt;Tanglewood Music Center&lt;/a&gt;. According to Dr. Jes\u00fas C. Romero, Moncayo was invited to attend there by &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Copland\"&gt;Aaron Copland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serge%20Koussevitzky\"&gt;Serge Koussevitzky&lt;/a&gt;. The Symphony was scheduled to be premiered by the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico on 21 August 1942, but the performance was postponed. The premi\u00e8re would take place a couple of years later. The program notes of 1 September 1944, written by Francisco Agea, explain that the two last movements were written in Massachusetts:\nBoth movements were written in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, when Moncayo, invited by the director &lt;a href=\"Serge%20Koussevitzky\"&gt;Serge Koussevitzky&lt;/a&gt;, attended the &lt;a href=\"Tanglewood%20Music%20Center\"&gt;Tanglewood Music Center&lt;/a&gt; and the special courses taught to the new generations of composers. It is evident that the author, finding himself abroad and longing for his fatherland, felt the need to express himself in a Mexican language.\nMoncayo worked at Tanglewood not only on his symphony but also completed another work, probably in Copland's composition course, \"Llano Grande\" for chamber orchestra, which was premiered by the orchestra during the Berkshire Festival precisely on 21 August. \"Arroyos\" by Blas Galindo, Moncayo's alter ego in this trip, was premiered at Tanglewood a few days before, on 17 August. The two Mexicans also had the opportunity to meet two other fellow composers and conductors who attended the courses at Tanglewood that summer, &lt;a href=\"Lukas%20Foss\"&gt;Lukas Foss&lt;/a&gt; and twenty-four-year-old &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Bernstein\"&gt;Leonard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;. Galindo reports his experiences about Tanglewood:\nThere I meet Bernstein, who was kilometers ahead of me, Lukas Foss . . . I remember &lt;a href=\"Hindemith\"&gt;Hindemith&lt;/a&gt; who was very serious. I also met Latin-American composers like &lt;a href=\"Ginastera\"&gt;Ginastera&lt;/a&gt; . . . [about &lt;a href=\"Var%C3%A8se\"&gt;Var\u00e8se&lt;/a&gt;] I have photos and autographed scores of his. I liked to go visit his studio in New York [City]; his compositions amazed me. He was building his techniques out of noises. I admire him because he dared to break with traditions, he was a pioneer. He knew that I cared about him.\nThe programs of 1945 reveal that Moncayo was appointed assistant conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico in that year and that his activities as conductor increased. The year 1946, the rising conducting career of Moncayo brought him to his next position. Ch\u00e1vez appointed the thirty-four-year-old conductor as artistic director of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, while Ch\u00e1vez remained its musical director.\nSince it was not my intention to interrupt my achievement (the OSM), but that it continue under the responsibility of the Board of the Symphony and the competent and able technicians that they would recruit, I had no other choice but to remain as director of the orchestra, with the greatest and best desire that the new artistic director that we selected to formally work beside me, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo, would arrive to take full responsibility of the situation.\nHowever, the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico season program of 1948 (13 February to 25 April) no longer lists Moncayo as a member of the orchestra. In 1948 &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20Moncada\"&gt;Eduardo Hern\u00e1ndez Moncada&lt;/a&gt; was the conductor of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)&lt;/a&gt; (OSN)\u2014created in 1947 under the aegis of the &lt;a href=\"Instituto%20Nacional%20de%20Bellas%20Artes%20y%20Literatura\"&gt;National Institute of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and within the programs Moncayo's name appears on the list of musicians as the orchestra pianist.\nCh\u00e1vez, as general director of the Fine Arts Institute, appointed Moncayo as music director/conductor of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 1949.\nThe last program found with Moncayo's name as conductor of the OSN dates from Wednesday 17 February 1954. It was a memorial concert held at the Palace of Fine Arts to honor a distinguished music professor, Don Luis Moctezuma, recently deceased. The program consisted of some words of appraisal by &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9s%20Iduarte\"&gt;Andr\u00e9s Iduarte&lt;/a&gt;, General Director of the INBA, Three Pieces for Orchestra by Moncayo, the Concerto for Three Pianos and Orchestra by J. S. Bach, an address by professor Manuel Bermejo Chibr\u00e1s, followed by &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Rachmaninoff%29\"&gt;Piano Concerto No. 2&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rachmaninoff\"&gt;Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt;. This was the last time in his life Moncayo conducted the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico. His name never again appeared on a program of the OSN.\nOn 16 June 1958, Moncayo died in his home, at 295 Amsterdam Avenue, Mexico City, only a few days before his forty-sixth birthday.\nMusical legacy.\nJos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo is best known as the composer of \"\", a bright, short orchestral arrangement of popular dances from the eastern state of Veracruz, that is sometimes included in concerts by American orchestras. Scholarly research about this composer in the United States is today still scarce. Despite being highly regarded in his own country, Moncayo has been the subject of scant academic research, restricted to some program notes; magazine, newspaper and journal articles; and short paragraphs in music dictionaries and encyclopedias. Although the major contribution of Moncayo to Mexican music has been in the field of composition, he also played a relevant role in the national stage of culture during the ten years of his conducting career (1944\u20131954). As orchestra conductor, his promising career was hampered by a difficult cultural environment, political situations and premature death. According to Torres-Chibr\u00e1s, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo's career as an orchestra conductor is a subject that has not been exhausted by Mexican or foreign scholars. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alcaraz, musicologist and leading music critic of Mexico, assesses that:\nMexican nationalism vigorously encompasses a period whose chronological limits may be fixed for study purposes with some precision in 1928: the year of the founding of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico and ending three decades later, in 1958 with the death of Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo, a composer born in 1912.\nMoncayo's death coincides with the decline of the Nationalist movement resulting from the demise of the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. &lt;a href=\"Yolanda%20Moreno%20Rivas\"&gt;Yolanda Moreno Rivas&lt;/a&gt; concludes:\nThe death of Moncayo in 1958 tangibly marked the end of the Mexican nationalist composition school. In the same way that his work without followers surpassed and abolished the innocent use of the Mexicanism theme, his death closed the predominance of a composition style whose imprint marked musical creation in Mexico during more than three decades; although only at the beginning of the sixties would it be possible to talk about the definitive abandonment of the great Mexican fresco, the oblivion of the epic tone, and the search for new structural factors in composition.\nMoncayo's best-known work continues to be his colorful orchestral fantasy \"Huapango\" (1941), but his production also includes many other pieces of a high quality, notwithstanding their lesser fame. Among these are works like \"Amatzinac\" for &lt;a href=\"Western%20concert%20flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"string%20quartet\"&gt;string quartet&lt;/a&gt; (1935); his Symphony (1944); Sinfonietta (1945); \"Homenaje a &lt;a href=\"Cervantes\"&gt;Cervantes&lt;/a&gt;\" for two &lt;a href=\"oboe\"&gt;oboe&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"string%20orchestra\"&gt;string orchestra&lt;/a&gt; (1947); his &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"La Mulata de C\u00f3rdoba\" (1948); \"Tierra de Temporal\" (1949); \"Muros Verdes\" for &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt; solo (1951); \"&lt;a href=\"Bosques\"&gt;Bosques&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954); and the &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt; \"Tierra\" (1956)."
