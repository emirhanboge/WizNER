    "text": "Silnyy or Silny (, \"Strong\") was a &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Navy\"&gt;Soviet Navy&lt;/a&gt; Project 1135 &lt;a href=\"Krivak-class%20frigate\"&gt;Burevestnik-class&lt;/a&gt; Large Anti-Submarine Ship (, BPK) or Krivak-class &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Displacing&lt;/a&gt; full load, the vessel was built around the &lt;a href=\"Metel%20Anti-Ship%20Complex\"&gt;Metel anti-submarine missile system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;Launched&lt;/a&gt; on 29 August 1972, \"Silnyy\" served with the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Fleet\"&gt;Baltic Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. The vessel undertook a number of visits to nations friendly to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Verde\"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1976, while escorting the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; , the ship had a close encounter with the &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , although neither vessel was damaged. \"Silnyy\" was taken out of service for repairs in 1990. However, lack of funds meant that, instead, the ship was decommissioned on 30 June 1994 and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and development.\n\"Silnyy\" was one of twenty-one &lt;a href=\"Krivak-class%20frigate\"&gt;Project 1135&lt;/a&gt; Burevestnik (, \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%20petrel\"&gt;Petrel&lt;/a&gt;\")-class ships launched between 1970 and 1981. Project 1135 was envisaged by the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Navy\"&gt;Soviet Navy&lt;/a&gt; as a less expensive complement to the &lt;a href=\"Kresta%20II-class%20cruiser\"&gt;Project 1134A&lt;/a&gt; \"Berkut\" A (&lt;a href=\"NATO%20reporting%20name\"&gt;NATO reporting name&lt;/a&gt; 'Kresta II') and &lt;a href=\"Kara-class%20cruiser\"&gt;Project 1134B&lt;/a&gt; \"Berkut\" B (NATO reporting name 'Kara') classes of &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20warfare\"&gt;anti-submarine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, called Large Anti-Submarine Ships (, BPK) by the Soviets.\nThe design was originally given to the TsKB-340 design bureau of &lt;a href=\"Zelenodolsk%2C%20Republic%20of%20Tatarstan\"&gt;Zelenodolsk&lt;/a&gt;, which had created the earlier &lt;a href=\"Petya-class%20frigate\"&gt;Project 159&lt;/a&gt; (NATO reporting name 'Petya') and &lt;a href=\"Mirka-class%20frigate\"&gt;Project 35&lt;/a&gt; (NATO reporting name 'Mirka') classes. However, the expansion in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ballistic%20missile%20submarine\"&gt;ballistic missile submarine&lt;/a&gt; fleet and the introduction of longer-ranged and more accurate &lt;a href=\"submarine-launched%20ballistic%20missile\"&gt;submarine-launched ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;s led to a revisit of the project to deal with the new threat. The work was transferred to the TsKB-53 bureau in &lt;a href=\"Leningrad\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt; who produced a substantially larger and more capable design. The design, created by N. P. Sobolov, combined a powerful missile armament with good seakeeping for a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20water%20navy\"&gt;blue water&lt;/a&gt; role and shared the same BPK designation as the larger ships. This was amended to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20ship\"&gt;Guard Ship&lt;/a&gt; (, SKR) from 28 July 1977 to reflect the change in Soviet strategy of creating protected areas for friendly submarines close to the coast.. NATO forces called the new class 'Krivak'-class &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Displacing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Standard%20displacement\"&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Full%20load%20displacement\"&gt;full load&lt;/a&gt;, \"Silnyy\" was &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . Power was provided by two M7 power sets, each consisting of a combination of a DK59 and a M62 &lt;a href=\"gas%20turbine\"&gt;gas turbine&lt;/a&gt; linked in a &lt;a href=\"COGAG\"&gt;COGAG&lt;/a&gt; arrangement and driving one fixed-pitch &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;. Each set was capable of a maximum of . Design speed was and range was at . The ship's complement was 197, including 23 &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Silnyy\" initially had a primary mission of anti-submarine warfare and for this end was equipped with four &lt;a href=\"Metel%20Anti-Ship%20Complex\"&gt;URPK-3 \"Metel\"&lt;/a&gt; missiles (NATO reporting name SS-N-14 'Silex'), backed up by two quadruple &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt; mounts for &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and a pair of &lt;a href=\"RBU-6000\"&gt;RBU-6000&lt;/a&gt; \"Smerch-2\" &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20rocket\"&gt;anti-submarine rocket&lt;/a&gt; launchers. Defence against aircraft was provided by forty &lt;a href=\"9K33%20Osa\"&gt;4K33 \"OSA-M\"&lt;/a&gt; (SA-N-4 'Gecko') &lt;a href=\"surface-to-air%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s which were launched from two sets of ZIF-122 launchers, each capable of launching two missiles. Two twin &lt;a href=\"AK-726\"&gt;AK-726&lt;/a&gt; guns were mounted aft and two single mounts for 21-KM guns were carried on the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt;. Provision was made for carrying 18 &lt;a href=\"Naval%20mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Silnyy\" had a well-equipped sensor suite, including a single MR-310A 'Angara-A' air/surface &lt;a href=\"search%20radar\"&gt;search radar&lt;/a&gt;, 'Volga' and 'Don-2' &lt;a href=\"navigation%20radar\"&gt;navigation radar&lt;/a&gt;s, MP-401S 'Start-S' ESM radar system and 'Spectrum-F' laser warning system. An extensive &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; complex was fitted, including MG-332 'Titan-2', which was mounted in a bow &lt;a href=\"radome\"&gt;radome&lt;/a&gt;, and MG-325 'Vega'. The latter was a &lt;a href=\"towed-array%20sonar\"&gt;towed-array sonar&lt;/a&gt; specifically developed for the class and had a range of up to . The ship was also equipped with the PK-16 decoy-dispenser system.\nConstruction and career.\n\"Silnyy\" was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Yantar%20Shipyard\"&gt;Yantar Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kaliningrad\"&gt;Kaliningrad&lt;/a&gt; on 15 March 1971, the third of the class to be constructed by the shipbuilder, and was given the yard number 154. The vessel was named for a Russian word which can be translated strong or fiery. &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;Launched&lt;/a&gt; on 29 August 1972 and commissioned on 30 June the following year, the ship joined the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Fleet\"&gt;Baltic Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 1974, \"Silnyy\" undertook the first of what would be number of visits to friendly nations. On 5 October, the vessel arrived at &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; , staying for four days. \"Silnyy\" returned on 26 June 1975 and staying for another five days. The ship also ventured further, crossing the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and, between 22 and 27 August 1976 and 11 and 15 October 1985, visited &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba. On 10 October 1988, \"Silnyy\" started a four day visit to &lt;a href=\"Praia\"&gt;Praia&lt;/a&gt;, Cape Verde, and between 5 and 9 October 1989, could be found at &lt;a href=\"Rostock\"&gt;Rostock&lt;/a&gt; in East Germany. The vessel also visited Nigeria, hosting a local deputation onboard. The visits were termed \"friendly\" and were frequently part of a wider programme of activity and cultural exchange.\nOn 26 July 1976, the vessel was escorting the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"US%20Navy\"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , which was shadowing the flotilla, approached closely. The US warship claimed that the Soviet ship \"shouldered\" it, which the Soviets denied. Neither vessel was damaged and the incident did not escalate.\nOn 3 December 1990, \"Silnyy\" sailed back to Kalingrad to be repaired, and was there at the time of the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; on 26 December 1991. The ship was to be transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Navy\"&gt;Russian Navy&lt;/a&gt;. However, lack of funding instead meant that the ship was decommissioned on 30 June 1994 and was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; at the Yantar shipyard between 1994 and 1995."
