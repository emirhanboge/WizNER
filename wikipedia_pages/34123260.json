    "text": "Leonid Mirsky (19 December 1918 &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1 December 1983 &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%2C%20England\"&gt;Sheffield, England&lt;/a&gt;) was a Russian-British mathematician who worked in number theory, linear algebra, and combinatorics. &lt;a href=\"Mirsky%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Mirsky's theorem&lt;/a&gt; is named after him.\nBiography.\nMirsky was born in Russia on 19 December 1918 to a medical family, but his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle, a wool merchant in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, when he was eight. His uncle's family moved to &lt;a href=\"Bradford\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, England in 1933, bringing Mirsky with them. He studied at &lt;a href=\"Herne%20Bay%20High%20School\"&gt;Herne Bay High School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%2C%20London\"&gt;King's College, London&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1940. Because of the &lt;a href=\"Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;evacuation of London during the Blitz&lt;/a&gt;, students at King's College were moved to &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20University\"&gt;Bristol University&lt;/a&gt;, where Mirsky earned a master's degree. He took a short-term faculty position at &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20University\"&gt;Sheffield University&lt;/a&gt; in 1942, and then a similar position in Manchester; he returned to Sheffield in 1945, where (except for a term as visiting faculty at Bristol) he would stay for the rest of his career. He became a lecturer in 1947, earned a Ph.D. from Sheffield in 1949, became senior lecturer in 1958, reader in 1961, and was given a personal chair in 1971.\nIn 1953 Mirsky married Aileen Guilding who was, at that time, a lecturer in Biblical History and Literature at Sheffield but later became a professor and Head of Department.\nHe retired in September 1983, and died on 1 December 1983.\nMirsky was an editor of the \"Journal of Linear Algebra and its Applications\", the \"Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications\", and \"Mathematical Spectrum\".\nResearch.\nNumber theory.\nMirsky's early research concerned &lt;a href=\"number%20theory\"&gt;number theory&lt;/a&gt;. He was particularly interested in the \"r\"-free numbers, a generalization of the &lt;a href=\"square-free%20integer\"&gt;square-free integer&lt;/a&gt;s consisting of the numbers not divisible by any \"r\"th power. These numbers are a superset of the &lt;a href=\"prime%20number\"&gt;prime number&lt;/a&gt;s, and Mirsky proved theorems for them analogous to &lt;a href=\"Vinogradov%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Vinogradov's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldbach%27s%20conjecture\"&gt;Goldbach's conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"twin%20prime\"&gt;twin prime&lt;/a&gt; conjecture for prime numbers.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, Mirsky proved strong &lt;a href=\"Asymptotic%20analysis\"&gt;asymptotic bounds&lt;/a&gt; on the number of distinct values taken by the &lt;a href=\"divisor%20function\"&gt;divisor function&lt;/a&gt; \"d\"(\"n\") counting the number of &lt;a href=\"divisor\"&gt;divisor&lt;/a&gt;s of the number \"n\". If \"D\"(\"n\") denotes the number of distinct values of \"d\"(\"m\") for \"m\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"n\", then\nThe &lt;a href=\"Herzog%E2%80%93Sch%C3%B6nheim%20conjecture\"&gt;Mirsky\u2013Newman theorem&lt;/a&gt; concerns partitions of the integers into &lt;a href=\"arithmetic%20progressions\"&gt;arithmetic progressions&lt;/a&gt;, and states that any such partition must have two progressions with the same difference. That is, there cannot be a &lt;a href=\"covering%20system\"&gt;covering system&lt;/a&gt; that covers every integer exactly once and has distinct differences. This result is a special case of the &lt;a href=\"Herzog%E2%80%93Sch%C3%B6nheim%20conjecture\"&gt;Herzog\u2013Sch\u00f6nheim conjecture&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"group%20theory\"&gt;group theory&lt;/a&gt;; it was conjectured in 1950 by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt; and proved soon thereafter by Mirsky and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20J.%20Newman\"&gt;Donald J. Newman&lt;/a&gt;. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Davenport\"&gt;Harold Davenport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rado\"&gt;Richard Rado&lt;/a&gt;.\nLinear algebra.\nIn 1947, Mirsky was asked to teach a course in &lt;a href=\"linear%20algebra\"&gt;linear algebra&lt;/a&gt;. He soon after wrote a textbook on the subject, \"An introduction to linear algebra\" (Oxford University Press, 1955), as well as writing a number of research papers on the subject.\nIn his research, Mirsky provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of matrices of various types (&lt;a href=\"symmetric%20matrix\"&gt;real symmetric matrices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20matrix\"&gt;orthogonal matrices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermitian%20matrix\"&gt;Hermitian matrices&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) with specified diagonal elements and specified &lt;a href=\"eigenvalue\"&gt;eigenvalue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHe obtained a tightening of the &lt;a href=\"Birkhoff%E2%80%93von%20Neumann%20theorem\"&gt;Birkhoff\u2013von Neumann theorem&lt;/a&gt; with H. K. Farahat stating that every &lt;a href=\"doubly%20stochastic%20matrix\"&gt;doubly stochastic matrix&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained as a &lt;a href=\"convex%20combination\"&gt;convex combination&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Permutation%20matrix\"&gt;permutation matrices&lt;/a&gt;. In Mirsky's version of this theorem, he showed that at most formula_2 permutation matrices are needed to represent every formula_3 doubly stochastic matrix, and that some doubly stochastic matrices need this many permutation matrices. In modern &lt;a href=\"polyhedral%20combinatorics\"&gt;polyhedral combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;, this result can be seen as a special case of &lt;a href=\"Carath%C3%A9odory%27s%20theorem%20%28convex%20hull%29\"&gt;Carath\u00e9odory's theorem&lt;/a&gt; applied to the &lt;a href=\"Birkhoff%20polytope\"&gt;Birkhoff polytope&lt;/a&gt;. He also worked with &lt;a href=\"Hazel%20Perfect\"&gt;Hazel Perfect&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Spectrum%20of%20a%20matrix\"&gt;spectra&lt;/a&gt; of doubly stochastic matrices.\nCombinatorics.\nIn the mid 1960s, Mirsky's research focus shifted again, to &lt;a href=\"combinatorics\"&gt;combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;, after using &lt;a href=\"Hall%27s%20marriage%20theorem\"&gt;Hall's marriage theorem&lt;/a&gt; in connection with his work on doubly stochastic matrices. In this area, he wrote the textbook \"Transversal Theory\" (Academic Press, 1971), at the same time editing a &lt;a href=\"festschrift\"&gt;festschrift&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rado\"&gt;Richard Rado&lt;/a&gt;. He derived conditions for pairs of set families to have simultaneous transversals, closely related to later work on &lt;a href=\"Flow%20network\"&gt;network flow&lt;/a&gt; problems. He also was one of the first to recognize the importance of &lt;a href=\"transversal%20matroid\"&gt;transversal matroid&lt;/a&gt;s, and he showed that transversal matroids can be represented using linear algebra over &lt;a href=\"Field%20extension\"&gt;transcendental extensions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"rational%20number\"&gt;rational number&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Mirsky%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Mirsky's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, a dual version of &lt;a href=\"Dilworth%27s%20theorem\"&gt;Dilworth's theorem&lt;/a&gt; published by Mirsky in 1971, states that in any finite &lt;a href=\"partially%20ordered%20set\"&gt;partially ordered set&lt;/a&gt; the size of the longest chain equals the smallest number of &lt;a href=\"antichain\"&gt;antichain&lt;/a&gt;s into which the set may be partitioned. Although much easier to prove than Dilworth's theorem, it has many of the same consequences."
