    "text": "Marci is a small, mostly unremarkable &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20craters\"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"impact%20crater\"&gt;impact crater&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Far%20side%20%28Moon%29\"&gt;far side&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. It is located about one crater diameter to the west of the prominent crater &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. To the northwest of Marci is the larger crater &lt;a href=\"Fitzgerald%20%28crater%29\"&gt;Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a roughly circular, bowl-shaped feature with slight outward bulges in the rim to the north and south. The inner walls are generally simple slopes the run down to the interior floor. This floor is about half the diameter of the crater. Marci lies within the bright &lt;a href=\"ray%20system\"&gt;ray system&lt;/a&gt; that surrounds Jackson.\nSatellite craters.\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Marci."
