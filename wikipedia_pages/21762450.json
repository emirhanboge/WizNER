    "text": "Eugenia Mantelli (1860- 3 March 1926) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; who had a prolific career in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; from the 1880s through the early part of the twentieth century. She possessed a flexible warm voice with a wide &lt;a href=\"vocal%20range\"&gt;vocal range&lt;/a&gt; that, while focusing mostly within the &lt;a href=\"mezzo-soprano\"&gt;mezzo-soprano&lt;/a&gt; repertoire, enabled her to sing roles normally associated with &lt;a href=\"contralto\"&gt;contralto&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt;s. Indeed, during her lifetime she was often identified as either a mezzo-soprano or a contralto by music critics without much consistency. While she had an excellent vocal technique and an exceptionally beautiful tone quality, her gifts as an actress and interpreter were only mediocre.\nBiography.\nMantelli was born in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. Her parents were both &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt; teachers and her earliest musical training was received from them. She entered the &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Conservatory\"&gt;Milan Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;, graduating from there in 1877 with diplomas in both voice and piano. She made her professional opera debut at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Nacional%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Carlos\"&gt;Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; as Urbain in &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Meyerbeer\"&gt;Giacomo Meyerbeer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Huguenots\"&gt;Les Huguenots&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1883. That same year she sang the role of Kaled in &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Massenet\"&gt;Jules Massenet&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20roi%20de%20Lahore\"&gt;Le roi de Lahore&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Mario%20Del%20Monaco\"&gt;Teatro Sociale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Treviso\"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a highly successful concert tour throughout &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Juli%C3%A1n%20Gayarre\"&gt;Juli\u00e1n Gayarre&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 1887 she sang the role of Adalgisa in &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Bellini\"&gt;Vincenzo Bellini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Norma%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Norma&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20dell%27Opera%20di%20Roma\"&gt;Teatro Costanzi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by several appearances at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20di%20San%20Carlo\"&gt;Teatro di San Carlo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, including the role of Eboli in &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Carlo\"&gt;Don Carlo&lt;/a&gt;\" with Adalgisa Gabbi, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Oxilia\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Oxilia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Kaschmann\"&gt;Giuseppe Kaschmann&lt;/a&gt;, and Auguste Boudouresque. In 1889 she joined the opera company that inaugurated the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Argentino%20de%20La%20Plata\"&gt;Teatro Argentino de La Plata&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. She sang with the company both in that city and at the &lt;a href=\"Sol%C3%ADs%20Theatre\"&gt;Teatro Solis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Montevideo\"&gt;Montevideo&lt;/a&gt;, notably sharing the stage with &lt;a href=\"Mattia%20Battistini\"&gt;Mattia Battistini&lt;/a&gt; in performances of \"&lt;a href=\"La%20favorita\"&gt;La favorita&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Amleto\"&gt;Amleto&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"La%20forza%20del%20destino\"&gt;La forza del destino&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Gli Ugonotti\" (the Italian version of \"Les Huguenots\").\nIn 1894 Mantelli joined the roster of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, making her first appearance there as Amneris in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt;\" on 23 November. She remained a member of the company until the end of the 1899-1900 season. One of her most successful roles at the Met was L\u00e9onor in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20favorite\"&gt;La favorite&lt;/a&gt;\", which she also sang for her first performance at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. She left the Met in 1900 just before she married her husband. Although she returned to the Met briefly in 1903 and appeared in a few &lt;a href=\"vaudeville\"&gt;vaudeville&lt;/a&gt; productions during the early 1900s, she spent most of her remaining career performing at the Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos. After retiring from the stage, she remained in Lisbon where she taught singing for many years."
