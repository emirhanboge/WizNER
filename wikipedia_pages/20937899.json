The Cambrian Coast Football League was founded in January 1920 and Barmouth were league champions in 1920 and 1922. In 1930 an eight-team Cambrian Coast League was revived. It ended in 1963.\nPrior to the outbreak of World War II, Barmouth FC and Dyffrin FC were two separate clubs competing in the Cambrian Coast League. Following the ending of hostilities, Barmouth &amp; Dyffryn United appear in the Cambrian Coast League. This would indicate that the current club was formed in 1945, following a merger of the two clubs.\nBarmouth joined the Central Wales League in 1963 and were champions in the 1969\u201370 season, also reaching the fifth round of the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Cup\"&gt;Welsh Cup&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City F.C.&lt;/a&gt;.

At the end of the 2000\u201301 season they withdrew after finishing last but one.
