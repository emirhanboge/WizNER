    "text": "St Paul's Church is a &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England%20parish%20church\"&gt;Church of England parish church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burton%20upon%20Trent\"&gt;Burton upon Trent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire\"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The church, on St Paul's Square and near the &lt;a href=\"Burton%20upon%20Trent%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1874 and was designed by the architects James M. Teale and &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Beckett%2C%201st%20Baron%20Grimthorpe\"&gt;Edmund Beckett Denison&lt;/a&gt; (later created Lord Grimthorpe). Later additions are by &lt;a href=\"George%20Frederick%20Bodley\"&gt;G. F. Bodley&lt;/a&gt;. The building is listed as Grade II*.\nThe church is in the &lt;a href=\"diocese%20of%20Lichfield\"&gt;diocese of Lichfield&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2005, St Paul's has been part of a combined parish with St Aidan's, &lt;a href=\"Shobnall\"&gt;Shobnall&lt;/a&gt;. Regular Sunday Masses are at 09.30 (Solemn Mass) and weekday masses are on Friday at 12.30. The church is normally open Mondays to Fridays 12 noon to 2.00 pm as well as for regular services\nHistory.\nA &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28station%29\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in Borough Road, Burton was opened in 1865 from Christ Church at the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Thomas%20Bass\"&gt;Michael Thomas Bass&lt;/a&gt;. By 1872 the mission was known as St Paul's and in 1873, it was assigned an ecclesiastical district, created out of the parishes of Christ Church, Holy Trinity, and &lt;a href=\"St%20Modwen%27s%2C%20Burton%20upon%20Trent\"&gt;St Modwen's&lt;/a&gt;. A new church, St Paul's, was opened in 1874 on a site soon known as St Paul's Square, with Michael Thomas Bass paying for the erection of the church and &lt;a href=\"vicarage\"&gt;vicarage&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of \u00a350,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). The church was consecrated on 7 April 1874 by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Lichfield\"&gt;Bishop of Lichfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Augustus%20Selwyn\"&gt;George Augustus Selwyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building.\nSt Paul's church was built to the design of J. M. Teale of Doncaster with assistance from &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Beckett%2C%201st%20Baron%20Grimthorpe\"&gt;Sir Edmund Beckett Denison&lt;/a&gt; (later Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe). It uses &lt;a href=\"Coxbench\"&gt;Coxbench&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancaster%20stone\"&gt;Ancaster stone&lt;/a&gt; in a geometrical, &lt;a href=\"decorated%20style\"&gt;decorated style&lt;/a&gt;. The shape is &lt;a href=\"cruciform\"&gt;cruciform&lt;/a&gt; with an aisled three-bay &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quatrefoil\"&gt;quatrefoil&lt;/a&gt; in cross section and five-bay &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, as well as north and south &lt;a href=\"transepts\"&gt;transepts&lt;/a&gt;, and a square central tower. The tower, of 123\u00a0feet, houses a &lt;a href=\"ring%20of%20bells\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; of ten bells; the original eight bells were recast in 1912 and two further bells were added in 1922.\nThe &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;column capitals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Label%20mould\"&gt;label stop&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the church were designed by a S. Tinkler of Derby and show &lt;a href=\"Naturalism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;naturalistic&lt;/a&gt; foliage, fruit, and animals with those in the nave representing the twelve months of the year. All the windows have early decorated style &lt;a href=\"tracery\"&gt;tracery&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"ballflower\"&gt;ballflower&lt;/a&gt; ornamentation in the chancel. The nave and transept &lt;a href=\"clerestories\"&gt;clerestories&lt;/a&gt; have triple &lt;a href=\"Lancet%20window\"&gt;lancet&lt;/a&gt;s, while the clerestories in the chancel have carved spherical triangles. The nave roof has traceried &lt;a href=\"spandrel\"&gt;spandrel&lt;/a&gt;s and principals supported on clustered wall shafts. There are six windows (one in the south aisle and five in the &lt;a href=\"narthex\"&gt;narthex&lt;/a&gt;) designed in an &lt;a href=\"Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Movement\"&gt;Arts and Crafts&lt;/a&gt; style by Archibald John Davies of the &lt;a href=\"Bromsgrove%20Guild\"&gt;Bromsgrove Guild&lt;/a&gt;. They date from 1919 to 1934.\nBetween 1889 and 1901 the eastern arm and south transept were considerably altered to the design of &lt;a href=\"George%20Frederick%20Bodley\"&gt;George Frederick Bodley&lt;/a&gt;, at the expense of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bass%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burton\"&gt;Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton&lt;/a&gt;. In 1889, the south chancel aisle was converted into a chapel for daily services and two years later an external &lt;a href=\"sacristy\"&gt;sacristy&lt;/a&gt; was added on the north side of the chancel with an internal porch added to the south transept door.\nThe chancel and sanctuary roof were painted and a canopy was added to the original large circular stone pulpit. The organ cases, one in the chancel and one high in the south transept are both by Bodley. The chancel floor was also relaid with red and white marble. The &lt;a href=\"reredos\"&gt;reredos&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by one designed by ecclesiastical and architectural sculptor &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Bridgeman\"&gt;Robert Bridgeman&lt;/a&gt; that depicted the &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion\"&gt;Crucifixion&lt;/a&gt; in a central panel of red shawk stone surrounded by the saints. The original reredos was transferred to &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Derby\"&gt;St George's Church, Derby&lt;/a&gt; in 1895 and is now in St Christopher's, &lt;a href=\"Ellistown\"&gt;Ellistown&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of other changes were made in the 20th century, paid for primarily by parishioners. A western narthex was added in 1910 as a memorial to Baron Burton, who had died the previous year. A calvary war memorial was erected in the churchyard in 1920 and a &lt;a href=\"bishop%27s%20chair\"&gt;bishop's chair&lt;/a&gt; of stone was built into the sanctuary wall in 1931. The two west bays of the nave and the narthex were converted into a church hall in 1979 and at the same time several items were added from the former &lt;a href=\"chapel%20of%20ease\"&gt;chapel of ease&lt;/a&gt; of St Margaret, including a wooden lectern by &lt;a href=\"Morris%20and%20Co.\"&gt;Morris and Co.&lt;/a&gt;, a painting of the Crucifixion by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Edgar%20Buckeridge\"&gt;Charles Edgar Buckeridge&lt;/a&gt; which was placed by the south door, statues of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20and%20Omega\"&gt;Alpha and Omega&lt;/a&gt; which were added to the south chancel aisle chapel, a banner of the Queen of Heaven probably by the &lt;a href=\"Ninian%20Comper\"&gt;Comper&lt;/a&gt; school, and statues of St Margaret of Antioch and St Michael slaying the Dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Mee\"&gt;Arthur Mee&lt;/a&gt; wrote of the decoration of St Paul's: \"All is nobly rich and beautiful in this wonderful church\".\nIn 1950 the church became a &lt;a href=\"Grade%20II%2A%20listed%20building\"&gt;Grade II* listed building&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgan.\nIn 1894-5 the original three &lt;a href=\"Manual%20%28music%29\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; organ, by &lt;a href=\"William%20Hill%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;William Hill &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; of London, was replaced by a four manual organ, the first built entirely by the &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hope-Jones\"&gt;Hope-Jones Electric Organ Company Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. The Hope-Jones organ was itself replaced in 1985 when parts including the &lt;a href=\"organ%20console\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; were removed to the Theatre Organ Heritage Centre of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ltot.org.uk\"&gt;Lancastrian Theatre Organ Trust&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eccles%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Eccles, Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. The Hill organ was moved to Trinity Methodist Church, in George Street in 1896, and then in 2012 to Sankt-Afra-Kirche in the Berlin suburb of &lt;a href=\"Gesundbrunnen%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Gesundbrunnen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe church now contains an organ formerly in the Central Methodist Church, Saltergate, &lt;a href=\"Chesterfield%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Chesterfield&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the north chancel aisle and its specification can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi%3FFn%3DRsearch%26amp%3Brec_index%3DR01519\"&gt;National Pipe Organ Register&lt;/a&gt;. The south transept organ case is now empty apart from a few large pipes from the earlier instruments."
