    "title": "Constitution of Prussia (1850)",
    "text": "The Constitution of Prussia () was adopted on 31 January 1850, and amended in the following years. This &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; was far less liberal than the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20German%20Empire\"&gt;federal constitution&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe government was not responsible to the \"&lt;a href=\"Abgeordnetenhaus%20%28Prussia%29\"&gt;Abgeordnetenhaus&lt;/a&gt;\" (lower chamber), whose powers were small and whose members were elected by a &lt;a href=\"Prussian\"&gt;Prussian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20three-class%20franchise\"&gt;three-class suffrage system&lt;/a&gt; based on tax-paying ab\"&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Herrenhaus&lt;/a&gt;\" (upper chamber) was largely controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt;, who held immense tracts of generally poor land east of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; (particularly in &lt;a href=\"East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt;). Endowed with little money and much pride, they had continued to form the officer corps of the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Army\"&gt;Prussian Army&lt;/a&gt;. The rising industrialists, notably the great &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20Province\"&gt;Rhenish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westphalia\"&gt;Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;n mine owners and steel magnates, although their interests were often opposed to those of the Junkers, exerted an equally &lt;a href=\"reactionary\"&gt;reactionary&lt;/a&gt; influence on politics. The \"potential power of the Prusso-German crown was vast\" (Christopher Clarke, \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\"); for example, the monarch held the power to nominate and dismiss Prussian officials (as well as federal ones). His &lt;a href=\"Royal%20assent\"&gt;assent&lt;/a&gt; was also necessary for legislation to pass into law, as well as &lt;a href=\"Commander-in-Chief\"&gt;Commander-in-Chief&lt;/a&gt; of the armed forces and coming with this, the power to appoint or dismiss officials during peacetime. In a &lt;a href=\"decree\"&gt;decree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;William I of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, stated that acts of the Prussian government were those of the King of Prussia, \"from whose decision they originate, and who expresses his opinion and will constitutionally through them\".\nTransformation.\nPrussia was transformed from a duchy to a kingdom on 18 January 1701 by Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg who declared himself &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;King in Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. He was allowed to be king only in the Prussian kingdom to avoid offending the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt; Leopold I, who had power over most of his lands. &lt;a href=\"Brandenburg\"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt; was treated as a separate state from the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prussian Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The state of Brandenburg was later considered as part of Prussia although most of its territories lay outside &lt;a href=\"Prussia%20proper\"&gt;Prussia proper&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom grew magnificently during King Frederick I reign.\nThe Kingdom.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick II of Prussia&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Frederick I's son Frederick William. He considered himself as the first true servant of Prussia. He promoted the development of Prussia such as the &lt;a href=\"Oderbruch\"&gt;Oderbruch&lt;/a&gt;. He also developed the military structure of the state and got involved in the First Partition of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Frederick the Great became known as the first \u201c\"&lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;King of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;\".\u201d During his reign, he practiced &lt;a href=\"enlightened%20absolutism\"&gt;enlightened absolutism&lt;/a&gt;. He was a fair king who introduced the civil code and abolished torture. He applied the principle that the &lt;a href=\"monarchy\"&gt;monarchy&lt;/a&gt; should not go interfere with the justice system.\nCrisis.\nIn 1847, Prussia experienced crisis common to all German states. There were catastrophic crop failures, bread riots, serious business &lt;a href=\"recession\"&gt;recession&lt;/a&gt; and government incapability. In 1848, &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20German%20states%23Prussia\"&gt;drastic changes&lt;/a&gt; in the Prussian kingdom began. Many bloody revolutions forced &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%20IV%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick William IV&lt;/a&gt; to make transformations in the government. New ministers occupied a middle position in an unstable government structure. The King was gradually recovering power over his states with the aid of a set of advisers called the \"&lt;a href=\"Kamarilla\"&gt;Kamarilla&lt;/a&gt;\". An elected national assembly was challenging the reemergence of the King's power. There began a &lt;a href=\"tug-of-war\"&gt;tug-of-war&lt;/a&gt; in the power over the governance of the Kingdom between the king and the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20National%20Assembly\"&gt;national assembly&lt;/a&gt;. After a series of cabinet reshuffles and government transformations, a new constitution was approved. It excluded a systematic democratic influence which shows that revolutionary movements had not much power. However, the king had lost his absolute powers. A new constitution was adopted which made the kingdom of Prussia a constitutional state. It was one of the most significant achievements of the revolutions.\nFree State of Prussia.\nThe Prussian constitution was liberalized after Prussia became a &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; in 1918, and the Junkers lost many of their estates through the cession of Prussian territory to &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. However, both the Junkers and the Rhenish industrialists continued to exert much power behind the scenes, and when &lt;a href=\"Franz%20von%20Papen\"&gt;Franz von Papen&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; chancellor in 1932 and commissioner for Prussia, they came into their own. In July, 1932, Papen suspended the Prussian parliament and ousted the Social Democrat &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Braun\"&gt;Otto Braun&lt;/a&gt;, who had been premier of Prussia (with brief interruptions) from 1920."
