    "text": "Open Cobalt is a &lt;a href=\"free%20and%20open-source%20software\"&gt;free and open-source software&lt;/a&gt; platform for constructing, accessing, and sharing &lt;a href=\"virtual%20world\"&gt;virtual world&lt;/a&gt;s both on &lt;a href=\"local%20area%20network\"&gt;local area network&lt;/a&gt;s or across the &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, with no need for centralized servers.\nThe technology makes it easy to create deeply collaborative and &lt;a href=\"hyperlink\"&gt;hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;ed multi-user virtual workspaces, virtual exhibit spaces, and game-based learning and training environments that run on all major software &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s. By using a &lt;a href=\"peer-to-peer\"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"message%20passing\"&gt;message passing&lt;/a&gt; protocol to reduce reliance on server infrastructures for support of basic in-world interactions across many participants, Open Cobalt makes it possible for people to hyperlink their virtual worlds via &lt;a href=\"3D%20computer%20graphics\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"web%20portal\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; to form a large &lt;a href=\"distributed%20computing\"&gt;distributed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"computer%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; of interconnected collaboration spaces. It also makes it possible for schools and other organizations to freely set up their own networks of public and private 3D virtual workspaces that feature integrated &lt;a href=\"web%20browsing\"&gt;web browsing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"voice%20chat\"&gt;voice chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"text%20chat\"&gt;text chat&lt;/a&gt;, and access to &lt;a href=\"remote%20desktop\"&gt;remote desktop&lt;/a&gt; applications and services.\nOpen Cobalt uses the &lt;a href=\"Squeak\"&gt;Squeak&lt;/a&gt; software environment, which is an open-source &lt;a href=\"Smalltalk\"&gt;Smalltalk&lt;/a&gt; system freely available for Windows, Mac and Unix. As is true of almost any Smalltalk application, Open Cobalt has identical functioning on any supported platform. As a Smalltalk system, it can usually be updated while the system is running without needing a restart.\nExpected uses.\nOpen Cobalt is designed to enable the deployment of secure virtual world spaces that support education, research, and the activities of &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20enterprise\"&gt;virtual organizations&lt;/a&gt;. By leveraging &lt;a href=\"OpenGL\"&gt;OpenGL&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"3D%20graphics\"&gt;3D graphics&lt;/a&gt;, Open Cobalt supports highly scalable collaborative &lt;a href=\"data%20visualization\"&gt;data visualization&lt;/a&gt;, virtual learning and problem solving environments, 3D wikis, online gaming environments termed &lt;a href=\"Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game\"&gt;Massively multiplayer online role-playing game&lt;/a&gt;s (MMORPGs), and privately and securely maintained multi-user virtual environments.\nThe Open Cobalt application leverages peer-based messaging to eliminate the need for virtual world servers/commercial services and makes it very simple for &lt;a href=\"end-user\"&gt;end-user&lt;/a&gt;s to create and securely share deeply collaborative virtual worlds that run on all major software operating systems. Users moving through and interacting within Open Cobalt worlds simultaneously participate and collaborate in a dynamic, concurrent environment where they can work, explore, and learn at a level of integration and extensibility not easily achieved through commercial virtual world technologies. With no licensing fees, users and developers can also freely build and share highly capable multi-user virtual workspaces, game-based learning and training environments, or even just create places to meet and interact with friends.\nHistory.\nOpen Cobalt is derived from the &lt;a href=\"croquet%20project\"&gt;Croquet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"software%20development%20kit\"&gt;software development kit&lt;/a&gt; (SDK) that was publicly released under the &lt;a href=\"MIT%20License\"&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Hewlett-Packard\"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; and the Croquet Consortium in early 2007.\nIn early 2008, and with the support of the &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20W.%20Mellon%20Foundation\"&gt;Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Lombardi\"&gt;Julian Lombardi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20P.%20McCahill\"&gt;Mark P. McCahill&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;, launched the &lt;a href=\"community%20source\"&gt;community-based software development effort&lt;/a&gt; to build Open Cobalt as an &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"virtual%20world\"&gt;virtual world&lt;/a&gt; browser &lt;a href=\"Application%20software\"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; and construction toolkit.\nIn May 2008, Lombardi was awarded a &lt;a href=\"National%20Science%20Foundation\"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; grant to further strengthen the community-based software development effort and bring the Open Cobalt virtual world browser to its &lt;a href=\"alpha%20software\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; release.\nTogether with John Dougan as technical project lead and a growing international community of software developers and volunteers, the Open Cobalt project contributors released Open Cobalt Alpha in April 2010.\nOpenCobalt 1.0 alpha 22 was released in June 2015. Recent activity involving the project can be found in the Open Cobalt Google Group.\nGoals.\nThe goals of the Open Cobalt effort are to stimulate the use of distributed virtual environments, advance visual simulations, and deepen collaboration in education, research, and personal entertainment - and in so doing to:\nFeatures.\nOpen Cobalt is both an end-user application and full featured software development environment for creating a rich network of end-user created interlinked virtual worlds. It is more extensible than the proprietary technologies behind collaborative worlds such as &lt;a href=\"Second%20Life\"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"ViOS\"&gt;ViOS&lt;/a&gt;. This is because:\n3D hyperlinking.\nUnlike most other virtual world platforms (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"OpenSimulator\"&gt;OpenSimulator&lt;/a&gt;'s Hypergrid architecture), Open Cobalt uses a method of &lt;a href=\"hyperlinking\"&gt;hyperlinking&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"space-linking\", which resembles a window frame or portal and, when revolved, shows a 360-degree real-time view of one region to a user in another region; such portals can also be walked through by users. Space-linking is an alternative to teleportation, a more common means of traversing between regions or spaces, and is also a primary means of travelling between whole grids.\nLike &lt;a href=\"MediaWiki\"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;'s s, such portals are also used to link to uncreated spaces or regions (colored in black) in order to indicate the need to create newer spaces.\nTechnical functions.\nOpen Cobalt is an application built using the &lt;a href=\"Croquet%20project\"&gt;Open Croquet&lt;/a&gt; software developer's toolkit. Its relationship to Open Croquet provides it with a number of powerful capabilities.\nProgramming environment.\nOpen Cobalt's software development environment enables programmers to enjoy the capabilities of a true &lt;a href=\"late-bound\"&gt;late bound&lt;/a&gt;, message sending language. Because it is built on &lt;a href=\"Squeak\"&gt;Squeak&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Croquet%20Project\"&gt;Croquet&lt;/a&gt;, Open Cobalt is a purely &lt;a href=\"object-oriented%20programming\"&gt;object-oriented programming&lt;/a&gt; system that allows for significant flexibility in its design and implementation.\nWithin Open Cobalt, programmers may edit the &lt;a href=\"source%20code\"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of the 3D world from within the world, and immediately see the result while the world is still running. The running program does not have to be ended, and there is no compile-link-run-debug development loop. Any part of the program may be edited, down to the &lt;a href=\"virtual%20machine\"&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; (VM) and &lt;a href=\"OpenGL\"&gt;OpenGL&lt;/a&gt; calls. Open Cobalt's reliance on Squeak's generalized storage allocator and &lt;a href=\"Garbage%20collection%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;garbage collector&lt;/a&gt; makes it highly efficient in real-time and allows reshaping of objects to be done safely.\nAs with Squeak, Open Cobalt supports many non-English languages and &lt;a href=\"font\"&gt;font&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;.\nSynchronization architecture.\nUnderlying Open Cobalt is an &lt;a href=\"Object-oriented%20programming\"&gt;object-oriented&lt;/a&gt; semantics based on active &lt;a href=\"Object%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt; that have the capability of temporal &lt;a href=\"Reflection%20%28computer%20programming%29\"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Object-oriented%20programming\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; is aware of, and in direct control, of its behavior in time. Open Cobalt also directly supports replication of computation, allowing computation to be moved close to the point of interaction on demand, while maintaining a consistent view of behaviors that can scale to include thousands of nodes. It does this by using a combination of &lt;a href=\"Object-oriented%20programming\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; semantics along with a modified version of &lt;a href=\"David%20P.%20Reed\"&gt;David P. Reed&lt;/a&gt;'s TeaTime peer-based messaging protocol as a distributed message transactional system enabling replicated computation (synchronization) across multiple peers. This makes replicated computation as easily as replicating data - and makes synchronization of all events across multiple peers a fundamental property of the system.\nOwing to these properties, software developers can use Open Cobalt as a way of creating deeply collaborative applications without the effort needed to understand how replicated applications work. This reduces the programming overhead needed for widespread deployment of deeply capable collaborative virtual spaces. It also makes it possible to deploy and coordinate the activities of virtual worlds on multiple machines without the need to maintain central server resources (other than those needed for specialized data and institutional middleware services).\nOpen Cobalt's implementation of TeaTime includes:"
