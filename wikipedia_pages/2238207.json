    "text": "Khash (; known by the derivations \"khashi\" () and , respectively) is a dish of boiled cow or sheep parts, which might include the head, feet, and stomach (&lt;a href=\"tripe\"&gt;tripe&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt is also known by other designations, namely pacha (; ; &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamian%20Arabic\"&gt;Mesopotamian Arabic&lt;/a&gt;: pacha, \u067e\u0627\u0686\u0629; ; ; ), kalle-pache (; ; ), kakaj \u0161\u00fcrpi () or ser\u00fbp\u00ea ().\nConsidered originating in traditional &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20cuisine\"&gt;Armenian cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, khash and its variations are also traditional dishes in &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Arab%20states%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf\"&gt;Persian Gulf countries&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"khash\" originates from the Armenian verb (), which means \"to boil\". The dish, initially called \"khashoy\" (), is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, including &lt;a href=\"Grigor%20Magistros\"&gt;Grigor Magistros&lt;/a&gt; (11th century), &lt;a href=\"Mkhitar%20Heratsi\"&gt;Mkhitar Heratsi&lt;/a&gt; (12th century), and Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; designation \"pacha\" stems from the term , literally meaning \"trotter\". The combination of a sheep's head and trotters is called , which literally means \"head [and] trotter\" in Persian.\nIn the South Caucasus.\nKhash is a purist meal with great parsimony in ingredients. The feet are depilated, cleaned, kept in cold water in order to get rid of bad smell, and boiled in water all night long, until the water has become a thick broth and the meat has separated from the bones. No salt or spices are added during the boiling process. The dish is served hot. One may add &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"garlic\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lemon\"&gt;lemon&lt;/a&gt; juice, or &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; according to one's taste. Dried &lt;a href=\"lavash\"&gt;lavash&lt;/a&gt; is often crumbled into the broth to add substance. Khash is generally served with a variety of other foods, such as hot &lt;a href=\"bell%20pepper\"&gt;green and yellow pepper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pickling\"&gt;pickle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"radish\"&gt;radish&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, and fresh &lt;a href=\"leaf%20vegetable\"&gt;greens&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"garden%20cress\"&gt;cress&lt;/a&gt;. The meal is almost always accompanied by &lt;a href=\"vodka\"&gt;vodka&lt;/a&gt; (preferably &lt;a href=\"morus%20%28plant%29\"&gt;mulberry&lt;/a&gt; vodka) and &lt;a href=\"mineral%20water\"&gt;mineral water&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Georgia, Khashi is served together with onions, milk, salt and &lt;a href=\"Chacha%20%28brandy%29\"&gt;chacha&lt;/a&gt;. Usually they eat this dish early morning, or during hangovers.\nIn the medieval Armenian medical textbook \"&lt;a href=\"Relief%20of%20Fevers\"&gt;Relief of Fevers&lt;/a&gt;\" (1184), khash was described as a dish with healing properties, e.g., against snuffle. It was recommended to eat it while drinking wine. In case of ailment, khash from the legs of a yeanling (lamb or kid) was advised.\nFormerly a nutritious winter food, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal. Modern-day convention in &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt; dictates that it should be consumed during the month that has an \"r\" in its name, thus excluding May, June, July, and August (\"&lt;a href=\"month\"&gt;month&lt;/a&gt; names in &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20language\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; are derivatives of the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; names\"). Khash is traditionally consumed during cold months in &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20dishes%20from%20the%20Caucasus\"&gt;South Caucasus&lt;/a&gt;, khash is often seen as food to be consumed in the mornings after a party, as it is known to battle hangovers (especially by men) and eaten with a \"&lt;a href=\"hair%20of%20the%20dog\"&gt;hair of the dog&lt;/a&gt;\" vodka chaser.\nThere is much &lt;a href=\"ritual\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; involved in khash parties. Many participants abstain from eating the previous evening, and insist upon using only their hands to consume the unusual (and often unwieldy) meal. Because of the potency and strong smell of the meal, and because it is eaten early in the mornings and so often enjoyed in conjunction with alcohol, khash is usually served on the weekend or on &lt;a href=\"holiday\"&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Iran.\nKalle-pache (; ; literally meaning \"head [and] trotter\") consists of a sheep's head (&lt;a href=\"Offal%23Middle%20East%20and%20North%20Africa\"&gt;including the brain&lt;/a&gt;) and trotters, and is typically seasoned with &lt;a href=\"lemon\"&gt;lemon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cinnamon\"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;. Usually consumed as a breakfast soup, kalle-pache is traditional to Afghanistan and &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Iran, kalle-pache is usually cooked in specialty stores, and is served in the morning. It is especially consumed during cold seasons. To prepare kalle-pache, the sheep's head and trotters are collected, cooked, and treated as per the recipe.\nIn Israel.\nDuring winter, it is very common to eat sheep or cow parts soup with onions, spices and squeezed lemon and is prepared in many ways such as maraq regel (leg soup), maraq moh (brain soup), maraq me'ayim (intestine soup), maraq beten (tripe soup) and maraq rosh (head soup)\nit is usually accompanied by an alcoholic drink, usually &lt;a href=\"arak%20%28drink%29\"&gt;arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Iraq.\nPacha is a traditional &lt;a href=\"Iraqi%20cuisine\"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; dish made from sheep's head, trotters, and stomach; all boiled slowly and served with bread sunken in the broth. The cheeks and tongues are considered the best parts. Many people prefer not to eat the eyeballs, which could be removed before cooking. The stomach lining would be filled with rice and lamb and stitched with a sewing thread (). Sheep brain is also included.\nIn Arab countries.\nThe dish is known in &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Gulf\"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; countries as \"Pacheh\" (), since the Arabic alphabet has no letters 'p' and 'ch' so the dish is written with 'b' and 'j' as in \"Bajeh\" ). A variation of that is found in other Arab countries such as in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and is known as \"kawari\"' (), Egyptians eat cow brain and sheep brain.\nIn Albania.\n&lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;'s popular pache () consists of a sheep's or any cattle's head, that is boiled until meat comes off easily. It is then stewed with garlic, onion, black pepper, and vinegar. Sometimes a little flour is added to thicken the stew. It is also frequently cooked with cattle feet or tripe. It makes a hot and hearty winter stew.\nIn Turkey.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20cuisine\"&gt;Turkish culinary culture&lt;/a&gt;, \"pacha\" is a generic word for certain soup preparations, especially with offal, but also without it. In most parts of &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, such as in &lt;a href=\"Kastamonu%20Province\"&gt;Kastamonu&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, the term (\"feet pacha\") is used for cow, sheep, or goat hooves, and the term is used for \"head pacha\" (&lt;a href=\"chorba\"&gt;chorba&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes the term is also used for &lt;a href=\"beef%20tongue\"&gt;tongue&lt;/a&gt; soup, while \"meat pacha\" is made with (&lt;a href=\"scrag%20end\"&gt;scrag end&lt;/a&gt; of sheep's neck). In Turkey, the word refers to a sheep's head roasted in the oven, which is served after grilling at specialized offal restaurants.\nIn Greece.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greek%20cuisine\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; version, called \"pats\u00e1s\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2), may be seasoned with red wine vinegar and garlic (\"skordostoubi\"), or thickened with &lt;a href=\"Avgolemono\"&gt;avgol\u00e9mono&lt;/a&gt;. The Greek version sometimes uses calf feet with the tripe.\nSpecialized &lt;a href=\"taverna\"&gt;taverna&lt;/a&gt;s serving patsa are known as \"patsatzidika\". Because patsas has the reputation of remedying hang-over and aiding digestion, \"patsatzidika\" are often working overnight, serving people returning home after &lt;a href=\"dinner\"&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clubbing%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;clubbing&lt;/a&gt;."
