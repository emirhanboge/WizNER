    "text": "St Mary's Church is a &lt;a href=\"redundant%20church\"&gt;redundant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; church in the village of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Hormead\"&gt;Little Hormead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is recorded in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England\"&gt;National Heritage List for England&lt;/a&gt; as a designated Grade\u00a0I &lt;a href=\"Listed%20building%23England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;, and is under the care of the &lt;a href=\"Churches%20Conservation%20Trust\"&gt;Churches Conservation Trust&lt;/a&gt;. The church is particularly noted for its Norman door, made of wood and ironwork. It is described as a \"work of outstanding importance\", and a \"rare and precious survival\".\nHistory.\nThe church dates from the 11th\u00a0century. It was recorded in the &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; as serving the villages of Little Hormead and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hormead\"&gt;Great Hormead&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt in the early 13th\u00a0century and a &lt;a href=\"bellcote\"&gt;bellcote&lt;/a&gt; was added in the 15th\u00a0century. A south porch was added in the 18th\u00a0century. In 1888 the church was &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20restoration\"&gt;restored&lt;/a&gt;, during which the east end was rebuilt and the bellcote was reconstructed. In the 13th\u00a0century St\u00a0Nicholas' Church had been built in Great Hormead, and Little Hormead lost its independent &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. It was &lt;a href=\"vesting\"&gt;vested&lt;/a&gt; in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1995.\nArchitecture.\nExterior.\nSt Mary's is constructed in &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; with stone dressings. The south porch is in brick, and the roofs have red tiles. The bellcote is timber with a pyramidal roof. There is a &lt;a href=\"canonical%20sundial\"&gt;canonical sundial&lt;/a&gt; on the south wall. The plan of the church consists of a tall narrow &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href=\"aisle\"&gt;aisle&lt;/a&gt;s, a chancel at a lower level, a south porch, and a bellcote at the west end. Much of the church is &lt;a href=\"Norman%20architecture\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; in style, particularly the nave. This includes the north and south doorways, a north window and the chancel arch. The south window in the nave dates from the 15th\u00a0century. The two-light west window was inserted during the 1888 restoration and is in &lt;a href=\"Perpendicular%20Gothic\"&gt;Perpendicular&lt;/a&gt; style. The east window in the chancel is a triple &lt;a href=\"lancet%20window\"&gt;lancet&lt;/a&gt;. In the south wall of the chancel are two 13th-century lancet windows, a large 15th-century window, and a priest's door.\nInterior.\nThe octagonal &lt;a href=\"baptismal%20font\"&gt;font&lt;/a&gt; dates from the early 14th\u00a0century and has panels of blank &lt;a href=\"tracery\"&gt;tracery&lt;/a&gt; around its bowl. In the southeast corner of the chancel is a 15th-century &lt;a href=\"piscina\"&gt;piscina&lt;/a&gt;. Above the chancel arch is a carved and painted &lt;a href=\"Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Royal coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles\u00a0II&lt;/a&gt; dated 1660. \nThe 12th-century north door, described as having a \"most lavish display\" of ironwork, is no longer \"in situ\", but is preserved inside the church. It consists of two interlacing quatrefoil patterns, around which is a border containing scrolls, all of which is surmounted by a &lt;a href=\"Serpentine%20shape\"&gt;serpentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dendrochronology\"&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the trees from which the door is built were felled between about 1130 and about 1150."
