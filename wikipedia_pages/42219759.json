    "text": " is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"intermezzo\"&gt;intermezzo&lt;/a&gt; \") in two acts composed by &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Scarlatti\"&gt;Giuseppe Scarlatti&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; libretto by &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Coltellini\"&gt;Marco Coltellini&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally written for the wedding celebration of Jan Nepomuk, the eldest son and heir-apparent of Prince Joseph Adam I of Schwarzenberg, and premiered at the theatre in the &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD%20Krumlov%20Castle\"&gt;\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov Castle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD%20Krumlov\"&gt;\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov&lt;/a&gt; on 24 July 1768.\nThe first modern revival of \"Dove \u00e8 amore \u00e8 gelosia\" was staged at the Baroque Theatre of \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov Castle, the site of its original premiere, on 9 September 2011. \nThe music to one of Patrizio's arias, \"A che serve intisichire\" has been noted to share a degree of similarity with Cherubino's aria, \"Non so pi\u00f9 cosa son\" from &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Le%20Nozze%20di%20Figaro\"&gt;Le Nozze di Figaro&lt;/a&gt;, which was composed 18 years later."
