The current boys champion is Ben Taylor and Hayley Davis holds the 2010 girls title.\nBackground.\nThe tournament has its origins in the 1960s, when it was organised by &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;. In the early days it was an informally organised &lt;a href=\"competition\"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; that took place during the &lt;a href=\"school%20holidays\"&gt;school holidays&lt;/a&gt;. Today it attracts a considerable field of junior golfers from &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and offers boys and girls the opportunity to experience a major tournament and ultimately bid to become the Junior Golf Champion. In recent years, around 40,000 juniors have taken part in the qualifying round.\nIt is open to all permanent British and Irish residents under the age of 18 at the start of the year. A &lt;a href=\"golf%20handicap\"&gt;handicap&lt;/a&gt; of 28 and below for boys and 36 and below for girls is required. This year, a player from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; will also take part in the finals.\nFormat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Final%20%28competition%29\"&gt;finals&lt;/a&gt; of the Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championship, in association with The Telegraph, will feature 10 boys who qualify via the &lt;a href=\"Ladder%20tournament\"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, one boy who will receive a sponsor\u2019s invite, the girls' defending champion Hayley Davis, seven girls who qualify via the leaderboard and one girl who will receive a sponsor\u2019s invite . The winner of the Abu Dhabi Golf Club Junior Open, which took place the month before, will also complete the 21-strong field.\nBefore the finals begin, a &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;challenge match&lt;/a&gt; will take place, in which 21 of the UAE and Middle East\u2019s best young players will compete with the visitors.\nHistory.\nSuccess in the tournament has acted as a springboard for some exceptional young golfers, with past winners including &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Rose\"&gt;Justin Rose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Coltart\"&gt;Andrew Coltart&lt;/a&gt;, who have gone on to play at the highest level. Current boys and girls champions Stiggy Hodgson and &lt;a href=\"Carly%20Booth\"&gt;Carly Booth&lt;/a&gt; have both represented Great Britain and Ireland in amateur tournaments.\nOther past champions of note include &lt;a href=\"Mhairi%20McKay\"&gt;Mhairi McKay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Hudson\"&gt;Rebecca Hudson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Fisher\"&gt;Oliver Fisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nWwinners.\nBoys\nGirls\nAbu Dhabi's sponsorship.\nAbu Dhabi Tourism Authority have Title Sponsored the event since 2009 &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Dhabi%20Tourism%20Authority\"&gt;Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority&lt;/a&gt; (ADTA).\nThe involvement of ADTA, which manages and develops the emirate\u2019s tourism industry, is part of its strategy to market Abu Dhabi as a premier golfing destination.\nAbu Dhabi is home to the annual &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Dhabi%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;Abu Dhabi Golf Championship&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt; event that, along with the &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20Masters\"&gt;Qatar Masters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Desert%20Classic\"&gt;Dubai Desert Classic&lt;/a&gt;, forms part of the early-season &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Swing\"&gt;Gulf Swing&lt;/a&gt; of January and February each year.\nLike the ADJGC, the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship is held at the &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Dhabi%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Abu Dhabi Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n2009 championship.\nChris Lloyd completed a thrilling finish to the tournament by overhauling long-time leader &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Lewis%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Tom Lewis&lt;/a&gt; to take the boys title. In the girls match, Alexandra Peters held on to her overnight lead on the final day to take the trophy.\nLloyd played a winning final round of 73 to beat Lewis, who had led by eight shots at the end of the first round and four shots going into the final day's play. Lloyd, 17, from Bristol, bore down on Lewis and took the lead on the 12th hole. With a one shot lead going into the final hole he held his nerve to win with a final score of 11 under. Tomasz Anderson took third place with a score of four over.\nPeters clinched the girls\u2019 championship with a final score of five under, leaving her well ahead of nearest rival Jessica Wilcox who ended the tournament on level par. The 16-year-old, from Shifnal, Nottinghamshire, had gone into the final day with a four-shot lead and never looked in danger of losing it.\nFinishing strongly, Wilcox jumped into second place helped by a run of three birdies on the front nine, ahead of Holly Clyburn and Heidi Baek who both recorded scores of three over.\n2008 championship.\nStiggy Hodgson holed a 15-ft birdie putt on the second playoff hole to beat Tommy Fleetwood and win the 2008 Abu Dhabi Junior Golf Championship boys title. The two leaders finished 12 shots ahead of the field by finishing 12 under par over the three rounds.\nHodgson, who plays with an unorthodox swing with its exaggerated head turn, did not drop a shot until the last hole, a poor bunker recovery and three-putt against Fleetwood's seventh birdie, cancelling out a seemingly decisive two-stroke lead to take the final into sudden death. \n&lt;a href=\"Carly%20Booth\"&gt;Carly Booth&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, was untroubled by any of the competing girls as she decisively took the title. Her win by six shots at four under illustrated her mastery of the Abu Dhabi Golf Club\u2019s National course."
