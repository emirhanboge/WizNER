    "text": "A polyatomic ion, also known as a molecular ion, is a &lt;a href=\"Covalent%20bond\"&gt;covalently bonded&lt;/a&gt; set of two or more atoms, or of a &lt;a href=\"complex%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;metal complex&lt;/a&gt;, that can be considered to behave as a single unit and that has a net &lt;a href=\"electrical%20charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; that is not zero. Unlike a &lt;a href=\"molecule\"&gt;molecule&lt;/a&gt;, which has a net charge of zero, this &lt;a href=\"chemical%20species\"&gt;chemical species&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"ion\"&gt;ion&lt;/a&gt;. (The prefix \"poly-\" carries the meaning \"many\" in Greek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly described as polyatomic.)\nIn older literature, a polyatomic ion may instead be referred to as a \"radical\" (or less commonly, as a \"radical group\"). (In contemporary usage, the term \"radical\" refers to various &lt;a href=\"Radical%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;free radical&lt;/a&gt;s, which are &lt;a href=\"species%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; that have an &lt;a href=\"unpaired%20electron\"&gt;unpaired electron&lt;/a&gt; and need not be charged.)\nA simple example of a polyatomic ion is the &lt;a href=\"hydroxide\"&gt;hydroxide&lt;/a&gt; ion, which consists of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, jointly carrying a net charge of &lt;a href=\"elementary%20charge\"&gt;\u22121&lt;/a&gt;; its chemical formula is . In contrast, an &lt;a href=\"ammonium\"&gt;ammonium&lt;/a&gt; ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms, with a charge of +1; its chemical formula is NH+\u2074\nPolyatomic ions often are useful in the context of &lt;a href=\"acid%E2%80%93base%20reaction\"&gt;acid\u2013base chemistry&lt;/a&gt; and in the formation of &lt;a href=\"salt%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;salts&lt;/a&gt;. \nOften, a polyatomic ion can be considered as the &lt;a href=\"conjugate%20acid\"&gt;conjugate acid or base&lt;/a&gt; of a neutral &lt;a href=\"molecule\"&gt;molecule&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the &lt;a href=\"conjugate%20base\"&gt;conjugate base&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt; (H2SO4) is the polyatomic &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfate\"&gt;hydrogen sulfate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anion\"&gt;anion&lt;/a&gt; (). The removal of another &lt;a href=\"hydron%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;hydrogen ion&lt;/a&gt; produces the &lt;a href=\"sulfate\"&gt;sulfate&lt;/a&gt; anion ().\nNomenclature of polyatomic anions.\nThere are two \"rules\" that can be used for learning the nomenclature of polyatomic anions. First, when the prefix \"bi\" is added to a name, a hydrogen is added to the ion's formula and its charge is increased by 1, the latter being a consequence of the hydrogen ion's +1 charge. An alternative to the \"bi-\" prefix is to use the word hydrogen in its place: the anion derived from + , , can be called either bicarbonate or hydrogen carbonate.\nMost of the common polyatomic anions are &lt;a href=\"oxyanion\"&gt;oxyanion&lt;/a&gt;s, conjugate bases of &lt;a href=\"oxyacid\"&gt;oxyacid&lt;/a&gt;s (acids derived from the &lt;a href=\"oxide\"&gt;oxide&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"nonmetal\"&gt;non-metallic elements&lt;/a&gt;). For example, the &lt;a href=\"sulfate\"&gt;sulfate&lt;/a&gt; anion, , is derived from , which can be regarded as + .\nThe second rule looks at the number of oxygens in an ion. Consider the &lt;a href=\"chlorine\"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oxyanion\"&gt;oxyanion&lt;/a&gt; family:\nFirst, think of the \"-ate\" ion as being the \"base\" name, in which case the addition of a \"per-\" prefix adds an oxygen. Changing the \"-ate\" suffix to \"-ite\" will reduce the oxygens by one, and keeping the suffix \"-ite\" and adding the prefix \"hypo-\" reduces the number of oxygens by one more. In all situations, the charge is not affected. The naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based on a standard root for that particular series. The \"-ite\" has one less oxygen than the \"-ate\", but different \"-ate\" anions might have different numbers of oxygen atoms.\nThese rules do not work with all polyatomic anions, but they do work with the most common ones. Following table give examples for some of these common anion groups.\nOther examples of common polyatomic ions.\nThe following tables give additional examples of commonly encountered polyatomic ions. Only a few representatives are given, as the number of polyatomic ions encountered in practice is very large."
