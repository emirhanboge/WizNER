    "text": "Ashley National Forest is a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Forest\"&gt;National Forest&lt;/a&gt; located in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and southwestern &lt;a href=\"Wyoming\"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Forest's bounds are (with in Utah and in Wyoming) of vast forests, lakes, and mountains, with elevations ranging from . The forest covers portions of &lt;a href=\"Daggett%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Daggett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duchesne%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Duchesne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summit%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Summit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uintah%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Uintah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Utah%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; counties in Utah and &lt;a href=\"Sweetwater%20County%2C%20Wyoming\"&gt;Sweetwater County&lt;/a&gt; in Wyoming. Some of the most popular landmarks located in the forest include the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Gorge%20National%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uinta%20Mountains\"&gt;Uinta Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the highest mountain peak in Utah (&lt;a href=\"Kings%20Peak%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;Kings Peak&lt;/a&gt;). The forest also includes , or about 60.5%, of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Uintas%20Wilderness\"&gt;High Uintas Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; (with the rest being in the &lt;a href=\"Wasatch%E2%80%93Cache%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Wasatch\u2013Cache National Forest&lt;/a&gt;). The headquarters for the Ashley National Forest are located in &lt;a href=\"Vernal%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Vernal, Utah&lt;/a&gt; with ranger district offices in Vernal; &lt;a href=\"Duchesne%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Duchesne, Utah&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Roosevelt, Utah&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Manila%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Manila, Utah&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20River%2C%20Wyoming\"&gt;Green River, Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Petroglyph\"&gt;Petroglyph&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the forest suggest that the land had been hunted for centuries by native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. The first white men believed to have set foot in Ashley National Forest were the Spanish explorers &lt;a href=\"Dom%C3%ADnguez%E2%80%93Escalante%20expedition\"&gt;Dominques and Escalante&lt;/a&gt;, in 1776. The forest, however, was not thoroughly explored until the early 19th century when General &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Ashley\"&gt;William Henry Ashley&lt;/a&gt;, an organizer of a fur company, began looking for an outlet to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; for his business. General Ashley and his team began making their way up the &lt;a href=\"Green%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29\"&gt;Green River&lt;/a&gt; (one of the many bodies of water located in the forest) in the spring of 1825. After passing through the Flaming Gorge, General Ashley was convinced by the native Americans to turn around and head back up the Uinta Mountains. During his exploration, General Ashley wrote and hung his name out over one of the rivers that he had explored, which now lies below the water of the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Gorge%20Reservoir\"&gt;Flaming Gorge Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;; this is how Ashley National Forest received its name. Many other explorers would come and explore the forest, and eventually the first settlement in Ashley National Forest was made in 1872. It was settled by Captain Pardon Dodds, who brought about 2,000 cattle into the &lt;a href=\"Uintah%20Basin\"&gt;Uintah Basin&lt;/a&gt;. In a few years, all of the surrounding ranges were completely stocked with cattle and horses.\nOn July 1, 1908, by executive order of President &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, Ashley National Forest was created. The general boundaries of the forest remained unchanged until 1953. Most of the north slope of the Uinta Mountains was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Wasatch%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Wasatch National Forest&lt;/a&gt;, while Ashley National Forest received the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Creek%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;Rock Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duchesne%20River\"&gt;Duchesne River&lt;/a&gt; drainages. President &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; added approximately to the forest when he established the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area as part of Ashley National Forest in 1968. Since then, there have only been slight boundary changes to the forest.\nRecreational activities.\nThe forest contains four main byways to drive on, which take visitors through many different landmarks found in the forest and offers them a chance to see various forms of wildlife. For people who prefer to walk, the forest contains over of hiking trails. These trails cover the entire forest, taking hikers from extensive forests to rugged mountains. Many of these trails are designated for off-road vehicles as well, such as motorcycles, &lt;a href=\"All-terrain%20vehicle\"&gt;ATVs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"snowmobiles\"&gt;snowmobiles&lt;/a&gt;. Along the trails there are many campgrounds available to visitors. During the winter months, there are two facilities located in the forest called Yurts that provide cross-country skiers with overnight room rentals to escape the cold. There are also many lakes and rivers found throughout Ashley National Forest, which allows guests to take in some fishing while visiting. There are also some bodies of water in the forest that are designated for motorized water-crafts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"John%20D.%20Dingell%20Jr.%20Conservation%2C%20Management%2C%20and%20Recreation%20Act\"&gt;John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act&lt;/a&gt; created the Ashley Karst National Recreation and Geologic Area. It is 173,475 acres of &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscape protecting the watershed in Uintah County.\nUinta Mountains.\nOccupying a large piece of Ashley National Forest are the Uinta Mountains. With a main crest stretching more than and surrounded by massive secondary ridges extending north and south, this mountain range is the largest alpine area located in the Intermountain west. This mountain range also contains Kings Peak, the highest peak in Utah at . Hundreds of lakes, streams, and meadows can be found within the many basins located in the mountain range. The Uinta Mountains are also the home to many different types of wildlife including, &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountain%20elk\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mule%20deer\"&gt;mule deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coyote\"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cinnamon%20bear\"&gt;black bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lagopus\"&gt;ptarmigan&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"bird%20of%20prey\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; species, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"American%20marten\"&gt;marten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20river%20otter\"&gt;river otter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20goat\"&gt;mountain goat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bighorn%20sheep\"&gt;bighorn sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pronghorn\"&gt;pronghorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20cougar\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"American%20pika\"&gt;pika&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"marmot\"&gt;marmot&lt;/a&gt;s. The mountains also contain 16 designated trails () for visitors to explore from June to September.\nFlaming Gorge National Recreational Area.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Gorge%20National%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; is a popular recreational feature located at the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Gorge%20Reservoir\"&gt;Flaming Gorge Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; within Ashley National Forest. It is in Flaming Gorge, a partially submerged canyon on the &lt;a href=\"Green%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29\"&gt;Green River&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Recreation%20Area\"&gt;National Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; contains of both land and water, which is divided almost evenly in Utah and Wyoming. The canyon was named by explorer &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley%20Powell\"&gt;John Wesley Powell&lt;/a&gt;, who upon first looking at the red gorge believed that it was on fire.\nIn 1962 the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Gorge%20Dam\"&gt;Flaming Gorge Dam&lt;/a&gt; was completed, impounding the &lt;a href=\"Green%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29\"&gt;Green River&lt;/a&gt; to create the Flaming Gorge Reservoir. The reservoir is extremely popular for boaters, with five full-service marinas offering launching, storage, and maintenance facilities. Because the reservoir's water remains cool even in summer's extreme heat, it is popular with &lt;a href=\"water%20sport\"&gt;water sport&lt;/a&gt;s enthusiasts. The reservoir and Green River upstream are known for supporting a large number of &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the recreational area a fishing destination. The river is also a &lt;a href=\"river%20rafting\"&gt;river rafting&lt;/a&gt; destination. The recreational area has campgrounds and hiking trails along the of shoreline. There are also some secluded coves only accessible by boat."
