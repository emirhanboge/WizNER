    "text": "80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\" () was an infantry &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Italian Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The La Spezia was formed on 15 November 1941 and named for the city of &lt;a href=\"La%20Spezia\"&gt;La Spezia&lt;/a&gt;. The La Spezia was the only &lt;a href=\"air-transportable\"&gt;air-transportable&lt;/a&gt; infantry division of the army and earmarked for the planned &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Herkules\"&gt;invasion of Malta&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1942 the division was sent to &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the &lt;a href=\"North%20African%20Campaign\"&gt;North African Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. On 13 May 1943 the La Spezia surrendered to &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied forces&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWorld War I.\nThe division's lineage begins with the Brigade \"Spezia\" raised on 1 March 1915 with the 125th and 126th infantry regiments. The brigade fought on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and together with its regiments was disbanded on 29 November 1917 after having been destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Caporetto\"&gt;Battle of Caporetto&lt;/a&gt;. The brigade and its two regiments were raised again in &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; on 15 October 1918, but before the brigade could enter the &lt;a href=\"Macedonian%20front\"&gt;Macedonian front&lt;/a&gt; the war ended. After the war the brigade and its regiments were disbanded in June 1919.\nWorld War II.\nThe 80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\" was activated in &lt;a href=\"Pisa\"&gt;Pisa&lt;/a&gt; on 15 November 1941 and consisted of the 125th and 126th infantry regiments, and the 80th Artillery Regiment. As a division raised during the war the La Spezia did not have its own &lt;a href=\"regimental%20depot\"&gt;regimental depot&lt;/a&gt;s and therefore its regiments were raised by the depots of the &lt;a href=\"20th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BFriuli%26quot%3B\"&gt;20th Infantry Division \"Friuli\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"44th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BCremona%26quot%3B\"&gt;44th Infantry Division \"Cremona\"&lt;/a&gt;: the 125th Infantry Regiment \"La Spezia\" was raised in &lt;a href=\"Livorno\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; on 5 November 1941 by the 88th Infantry Regiment \"Friuli\" and the 126th Infantry Regiment \"La Spezia\" was raised in Pisa on 5 November 1941 by the 22nd Infantry Regiment \"Cremona\", while the 80th Artillery Regiment \"La Spezia\" was raised in Pisa by the 7th Artillery Regiment \"Cremona\".\nThe division was earmarked for the planned &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Herkules\"&gt;invasion of Malta&lt;/a&gt; and moved in June 1942 to &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Italy to be near the air bases from which it would depart for &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;. After the operation was canceled the division was flown from 1 October 1942 to &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, where it deployed to &lt;a href=\"Brega\"&gt;Brega&lt;/a&gt; ed &lt;a href=\"El%20Agheila\"&gt;El Agheila&lt;/a&gt; by early November. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein\"&gt;Second Battle of El Alamein&lt;/a&gt; Axis forces, including the La Spezia, were driven westwards by the victorious British &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Eighth Army&lt;/a&gt;. The La Spezia retreated to &lt;a href=\"Tarhuna\"&gt;Tarhuna&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Al-Khums\"&gt;Al-Khums&lt;/a&gt; on 2-14 January 1943, to &lt;a href=\"Tripoli\"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Zawiya%2C%20Libya\"&gt;Zawiya&lt;/a&gt; on 15-19 January 1943, and finally to the &lt;a href=\"Mareth%20Line\"&gt;Mareth Line&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; between 20 January to 4 February 1943.\nOn 23 February the German-Italian units on the Mareth Line entered the Italian &lt;a href=\"1st%20Army%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;1st Army&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 March 1943 the La Spezia participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Medenine\"&gt;Battle of Medenine&lt;/a&gt;, and ten days later in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Mareth%20Line\"&gt;Battle of the Mareth Line&lt;/a&gt;. During the latter battle the division lost half of its strength and on 25 March the division retreated together with the other Axis forces to the prepared defensive position at &lt;a href=\"Wadi%20Akarit\"&gt;Wadi Akarit&lt;/a&gt;. On 6-7 April 1943 the British Eighth Army broke through the Axis line in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Wadi%20Akarit\"&gt;Battle of Wadi Akarit&lt;/a&gt; and the Italian 1st Army was forced to withdraw &lt;a href=\"Enfidaville\"&gt;Enfidaville&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the British Eighth Army and Italian 1st Army at Enfidaville remained static, to their North Allied forces overran German and Italian defenses and took &lt;a href=\"Bizerte\"&gt;Bizerte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;. By 12 May 1943 the remaining 80,000 men of the Italian 1st Army were surrounded and the next day its commanding officer General &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Messe\"&gt;Giovanni Messe&lt;/a&gt; surrendered his army to British General &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Freyberg\"&gt;Bernard Freyberg&lt;/a&gt;. The La Spezia was officially declared lost on the 13 May 1943.\nOrganization.\nAttached to the division during the &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20campaign\"&gt;Tunisian campaign&lt;/a&gt;:\nCommanding officers.\nThe division's commanding officers were:"
