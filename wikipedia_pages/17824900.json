    "text": "La Cleopatra (1789) is an &lt;a href=\"opera%20seria\"&gt;opera seria&lt;/a&gt; in two acts by composer &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Cimarosa\"&gt;Domenico Cimarosa&lt;/a&gt; with an Italian libretto by Ferdinando Moretti.\nHistorical background and musical analysis.\n\"La Cleopatra\" was commissioned by Empress Catherine II of Russia in 1788. Cimarosa and Moretti were instructed to keep the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; short and give it a relatively simple plot. As a result, the opera is about a hundred minutes in length which is short for an opera of that period and time. The plot is also very straightforward, lacking the typical plot twists and intrigues of other opera serias of the day. Musically the opera is made up of mostly &lt;a href=\"arias\"&gt;arias&lt;/a&gt; with only a few &lt;a href=\"duet\"&gt;duet&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"quartet\"&gt;quartet&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;, and a march. Although music critics have admired the duet at the end of act one, the ballet music, and the final quartet, the opera as a whole is not considered particularly remarkable. The work premiered at the &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Theatre\"&gt;Hermitage Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, Russia, on 27 September 1789."
