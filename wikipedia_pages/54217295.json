    "text": "Mount Wellington is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20New%20York%20Region\"&gt;Central New York Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. It is located south of the Hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Springfield%20Center%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Springfield Center&lt;/a&gt; at the northern end of &lt;a href=\"Otsego%20Lake%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Otsego Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Mount Wellington rises above lake level. The extreme southern point of the mountain is called &lt;a href=\"Clarke%20Point\"&gt;Clarke Point&lt;/a&gt; and also referred to as the Shad Cam. It is known as \"The Sleeping Lion\", as it looks similar to a lion laying down, viewed from &lt;a href=\"Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Cooperstown, New York&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally named Mount Millington, but was renamed by &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Hall\"&gt;George Hyde Clarke&lt;/a&gt; in honor of &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Field Marshal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;The 1st Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, the victor of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Waterloo\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Clarke's schoolmate at &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt; in England."
