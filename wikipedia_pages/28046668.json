The city of Rosario was no exception and many football enthusiasts would meet in public parks to have a kick around. \nFootball clubs were being founded all over the city and young players from the Salta and Oro\u00f1o neighbourhoods decided to follow suit and create a club of their own.\nThis is how Club Atl\u00e9tico Provincial came to be founded on 25 May 1903, thanks to the generosity of the Banco Espa\u00f1ol Rosario branch's director of the time. \nOriginally a football only club, an athletics section would be added in 1910 then tennis in 1920, basketball in 1923 and many other sports would follow along the years. When football became professional in Argentina in the 1930s, CAP decided to remain amateur and football is now played at a recreative level at the club. \nMost other sports, however, are practiced at a competitive level and many CAP members went on to represent Argentina at international level. The first of which was &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Brunetto\"&gt;Luis Brunetto&lt;/a&gt; who represented Argentina in &lt;a href=\"Triple%20jump\"&gt;Triple jump&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1924%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1924 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, winning the silver medal.\nToday, the club is mostly known for its &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Provincial%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Provincial has played at the highest level of &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20de%20Rugby%20de%20Rosario\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Rosario&lt;/a&gt; for a fair number of years, the club has been overshadowed by Rosario rugby's powerhouses: &lt;a href=\"Duendes%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Duendes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jockey%20Club%20de%20Rosario%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Jockey Club de Rosario&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser extent, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Universitario%20de%20Rosario\"&gt;Universitario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Gimnasia%20y%20Esgrima%20de%20Rosario%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Gimnasia y Esgrima&lt;/a&gt;. However, in recent years, the club has achieved some success, winning the Torneo Regional del Centro in 2009. \nProvincial still remains one of the most successful teams in the province and is one of the five \"Rosarino\" clubs taking part in the inter-provincial &lt;a href=\"Torneo%20del%20Litoral\"&gt;Torneo del Litoral&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacilities.\nOne of the largest clubs in Argentina, the club counts more than 3,000 members. The institutions also owns 4 different locations throughout the city of Rosario, detailed below:"
