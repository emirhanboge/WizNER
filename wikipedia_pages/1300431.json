    "text": "Jorge Carlos Vergara Madrigal () (3 March 1955 \u2013 15 November 2019) was a Mexican businessman and film producer. He was the founder of the &lt;a href=\"multi-level%20marketing\"&gt;multi-level marketing&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Grupo%20Omnilife\"&gt;Grupo Omnilife&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to its health products business, Grupo Omnilife owns the &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"C.D.%20Guadalajara\"&gt;C.D. Guadalajara&lt;/a&gt;. Vergara was also owner of Costa Rican football team &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Saprissa\"&gt;Saprissa&lt;/a&gt;(2003-2011) and &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Chivas%20USA\"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; (2004-2014).\nVergara produced internationally recognized films such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Assassination%20of%20Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Oscar-nominated \"&lt;a href=\"Y%20Tu%20Mam%C3%A1%20Tambi%C3%A9n\"&gt;Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;\" through the production company, Producciones Anhelo.\nHe died on 15 November 2019 in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; as a result of a heart attack.\nCareer.\nBusiness.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara\"&gt;Guadalajara&lt;/a&gt;, Vergara once sold tacos on Mexican streets. Back in the 1980s Vergara sold condominiums and timeshares in &lt;a href=\"Manzanillo%2C%20Colima\"&gt;Manzanillo&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico, where he met and began working with John Peterson.\nWhen Peterson became a &lt;a href=\"Herbalife%20Nutrition\"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt; salesperson, he recruited Vergara and together they began selling Herbalife products in Mexico. Since Herbalife had not received Mexican government approval to sell their products, Peterson and Vergara had to smuggle the products into the country. After six months of smuggling the products into Mexico, Herbalife took notice and began the process of getting government approval. Vergara was asked to help get the Herbalife products approved by the Mexican government and was instrumental in helping Herbalife's founder, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20R.%20Hughes\"&gt;Mark R. Hughes&lt;/a&gt; deal with the Mexican Government. This gave Vergara insight into how a &lt;a href=\"Multi-level%20marketing\"&gt;multi-level company&lt;/a&gt; profits and expands into other countries. Vergara was partners with Roger Daley, Jim Fobair and Charlie Ragus. With already the 51% of the company, Vergara acquired the rest of Omnitrition at the end of the deal with his U.S. partners and took the whole control of Omnitrition de Mexico. Since its foundation in 1991, the privately owned corporation has grown from one company, Omnilife de Mexico, to comprise nineteen companies. Today, approximately 5.2 million people distribute Omnilife products in 22 countries, while the company has reached annual sales of nearly $4.2 billion.\nVergara was the director of Omnilife de Mexico from 1991 to his death.\nFilm.\nIn 1999, Vergara met film director &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20Cuar%C3%B3n\"&gt;Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; while seeking out filmmakers for his corporate movies. Cuar\u00f3n, however, was more interested in filming \"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\", and gave Vergara the screenplay. A known lover of films, Vergara read it and right away proposed that they begin production. In the process they established a production company &lt;a href=\"Producciones%20Anhelo\"&gt;Producciones Anhelo&lt;/a&gt; that would go on to co-produce &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20del%20Toro\"&gt;Guillermo del Toro&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Devil%27s%20Backbone\"&gt;The Devil's Backbone&lt;/a&gt;\", along with &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Almod%C3%B3var\"&gt;Pedro Almod\u00f3var&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"El%20Deseo\"&gt;El Deseo&lt;/a&gt; and del Toro's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.imdb.com/company/co0040776/\"&gt;Tequila Gang&lt;/a&gt;. Anhelo also produced &lt;a href=\"Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Cordero\"&gt;Sebasti\u00e1n Cordero&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Cr%C3%B3nicas\"&gt;Cr\u00f3nicas&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2002, \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" named Vergara one of its Ten Producers to Watch. For the 2004 edition of the &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Guadalajara International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Vergara created the JVC Award for Best Director, which was given to Fernando Eimbcke for his feature debut \"&lt;a href=\"Temporada%20de%20patos\"&gt;Temporada de patos&lt;/a&gt;\".\nChivas.\nVergara gained ownership of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team C.D. Guadalajara (popularly known as \"Chivas\") in 2002. Shortly after he took ownership in Mexico, while attending the 2004 U.S. &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; All-Star Game, he announced intentions to expand Chivas to MLS.\nVergara and MLS inaugurated &lt;a href=\"Chivas%20USA\"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, and the team played its first official season in 2005 with &lt;a href=\"Dignity%20Health%20Sports%20Park\"&gt;Dignity Health Sports Park&lt;/a&gt; in the Los Angeles area as its home stadium. Chivas USA was initially successful; in its first five seasons of operation, the team recorded four straight MLS playoff appearances. Both performance and attendance declined sharply after 2009. In August 2012, Vergara and his former wife became sole owners of the club, buying out former partners Antonio and Lorenzo Cu\u00e9.\nOn 20 February 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club. After being unable to find a buyer, the club folded following the 2014 season. A new club, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20FC\"&gt;Los Angeles FC&lt;/a&gt;, was founded in 2018, but with no connection to the former &lt;a href=\"Chivas%20USA\"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; club.\nPersonal life.\nVergara had six children: Yelena Vergara Zatarain, Amaury Vergara Zatarain, Kenya Vergara Zatarain, Uma Vergara Lerdo de Tejada, Valentina Vergara Fuentes, and Mariaignacia Vergara Fuentes.\nJorge Vergara divorced Ang\u00e9lica Fuentes T\u00e9llez in 21 September 2015. Jorge Vergara and Rossana Lerdo de Tejada were married 10 June 2017 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, M\u00e9xico.\nDeath.\nJorge Vergara died on 15 November 2019 at the age of 64 in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; as a result of a &lt;a href=\"cardiac%20arrest\"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;."
