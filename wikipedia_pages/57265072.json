    "text": "Rhythm of Structure is a multimedia interdisciplinary project founded in 2003. It features a series of exhibitions, performances, and academic projects that explore the interconnecting structures and process of &lt;a href=\"mathematics%20and%20art\"&gt;mathematics and art&lt;/a&gt;, and language, as way to advance a movement of mathematical expression across the arts, across creative collaborative communities celebrating the rhythm and patterns of both ideas of the mind and the physical reality of nature.\nIntroduction.\n\"Rhythm of Structure\", as an expanding series of art exhibitions, performances, videos/films and publications created and curated by multimedia mathematical artist and writer &lt;a href=\"John%20Sims%20%28artist%29\"&gt;John Sims&lt;/a&gt;, explores and celebrates the intersecting &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s of mathematics, art, community, and nature. Sims also created \"Recoloration Proclamation\" featuring the installation, &lt;a href=\"The%20Proper%20Way%20to%20Hang%20a%20Confederate%20Flag\"&gt;The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag&lt;/a&gt; (2004).\nFrom his catalog essay from the \"Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic exhibition\", Sims sets the curatorial theme where he writes: \"Mathematics, as a parameter of human consciousness in an indispensable conceptual technology, essential is seeing beyond the retinal and knowing beyond the intuitive. The language and process of mathematics, as elements of, foundation for art, inform an analytic expressive condition that inspires a visual reckoning for a convergence: from the illustrative to the metaphysical to the poetic. And in the dialectic of visual art call and text performative response, there is an inter-dimensional conversation where the twisting structures of language, vision and human ways give birth to the spiritual lattice of a social geometry, a community constructivism -- a place of connections, where emotional calculations meet spirited abstraction.\"\nFirst premiering at the Fire Patrol No.5 Gallery in 2003, with the show \"Rhythm of Structure: MathArt\" in &lt;a href=\"Harlem\"&gt;Harlem&lt;/a&gt;. This interdisciplinary project has featured numerous exhibitions around the country collaborating with many notable artists, writers, and musicians including: &lt;a href=\"Sol%20LeWitt\"&gt;Sol LeWitt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Piper\"&gt;Adrian Piper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorothea%20Rockburne\"&gt;Dorothea Rockburne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20D.%20Loving\"&gt;Al Loving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Overstreet\"&gt;Joe Overstreet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howardena%20Pindell\"&gt;Howardena Pindell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helaman%20Ferguson\"&gt;Helaman Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, John Hiigli, &lt;a href=\"Vandorn%20Hinnant\"&gt;Vandorn Hinnant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Finley\"&gt;Karen Finley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Scott\"&gt;Dread Scott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Spooky\"&gt;Paul D. Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Holman\"&gt;Bob Holman&lt;/a&gt;, Kate Rushin, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Verostko\"&gt;Roman Verostko&lt;/a&gt;, Joan Waltemath, &lt;a href=\"Tara%20Betts\"&gt;Tara Betts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brent%20Collins\"&gt;Brent Collins&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Field, Kazmier Maslanka, Ken Hiratsuka, Yael Acher Moriano, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Kostelanetz\"&gt;Richard Kostelanetz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kristin%20Prevallet\"&gt;Kristin Prevallet&lt;/a&gt;, John Sims, and former U.S. Poet Laureate &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Strand\"&gt;Mark Strand&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the exhibitions, another major aim of \"Rhythm of Structure\" is the building of an interdisciplinary creative community around the intersection of mathematics and all forms of art, as it might inspire new art, innovation art and mathematics education, and increased respect and understanding of the &lt;a href=\"rhythm\"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and structure of nature itself. Such community experiences are created through call and response performances, social media and special video music projects such as The Rhythm of Structure and The Pi Day Anthem featuring John Sims and Vi Hart .\nBackground.\nRhythm of Structure has its beginnings in Sims\u2019 work as one of the international curators for the exhibition \"Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences\", a citywide exhibition, in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%23General%20Conference\"&gt;UNESCO-ICSU World Conference of Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.\nThis led to the exhibition, \"MathArt/ArtMath\", curated by John Sims (then Coordinator of Mathematics at Ringling) and Kevin Dean, at the Selby Gallery &lt;a href=\"Ringling%20College%20of%20Art%20and%20Design\"&gt;Ringling College of Art and Design&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. This show presented a general survey of art inspired and framed by mathematics ideas of mostly American &lt;a href=\"Modern%20art\"&gt;modern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20art\"&gt;contemporary&lt;/a&gt; artists, as well as mathematicians working in the area of visual mathematics. The theme of the show was designed to examine the complexity and diversity of the meaning of &lt;a href=\"Mathematics%20and%20art\"&gt;mathematical art&lt;/a&gt;. The \"MathArt/ArtMath\" exhibition featured: &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Albers\"&gt;Josef Albers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Banchoff\"&gt;Thomas Banchoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Anuszkiewicz\"&gt;Richard Anuszkiewicz&lt;/a&gt;, Manuelo Baez, &lt;a href=\"Jhane%20Barnes\"&gt;Jhane Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Bill\"&gt;Max Bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Bochner\"&gt;Mel Bochner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brent%20Collins\"&gt;Brent Collins&lt;/a&gt;, David Davis, &lt;a href=\"George%20Deem\"&gt;George Deem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Denes\"&gt;Agnes Denes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M.C.%20Escher\"&gt;M.C.

There was a brochure and video produced for this exhibition.\nAfter the \"MathArt/ArtMath\" exhibition, Sims began working on a text about the nature of mathematical art leading to his chapter, \"Trees, Roots and a Brain: A Metaphorical Foundation for Mathematical Art\", in the book \"Mathematics and Culture II: Visual Perfection: Mathematics and Creativity\". In his chapter, he presents his ideas on the interconnection of mathematics, &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20art\"&gt;art and nature&lt;/a&gt;, setting the stage for his next group of exhibitions called \"Rhythm of Structure\".\nExhibitions.\n\"Rhythm of Structure:\" MathArt in Harlem (2003).\n\"MathArt in Harlem\", January 2003, Fire Patrol #5 Gallery in &lt;a href=\"Harlem\"&gt;Harlem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, featured artists Audrey Bennet, Brent Collins, &lt;a href=\"Agnes%20Denes\"&gt;Agnes Denes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helaman%20Ferguson\"&gt;Helaman Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gaines%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Charles Gaines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bathsheba%20Grossman\"&gt;Bathsheba Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, John Hiigli, Ken Hiratsuka, Adrienne Klein, &lt;a href=\"Sol%20LeWitt\"&gt;Sol LeWitt&lt;/a&gt;, John Little, &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20D.%20Loving\"&gt;Al Loving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marlena%20Novak\"&gt;Marlena Novak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Overstreet\"&gt;Joe Overstreet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howardena%20Pindell\"&gt;Howardena Pindell&lt;/a&gt;, John Powell, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Robbin\"&gt;Tony Robbin&lt;/a&gt;, Irene Rousseau, Clifford Singer, John Sims, and Joan Waltemath.\n\"Rhythm of Structure:\" The Mathematical Aesthetic (2004).\n\"The Mathematical Aesthetic\", 2004, Wilmer Jennings Gallery in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, included artists: &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Overstreet\"&gt;Joe Overstreet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20T.%20Biggers\"&gt;John Biggers&lt;/a&gt;, Brent Collins, &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Corinne%20Davis\"&gt;Lisa Corinne Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Eversley\"&gt;Fred Eversley&lt;/a&gt;, Terri Foster, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gaines%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Charles Gaines&lt;/a&gt;, Simon Gouverneur, James Little, &lt;a href=\"Alvin%20D.%20Loving\"&gt;Al Loving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vandorn%20Hinnant\"&gt;Vandorn Hinnant&lt;/a&gt;, Scott Johnson, &lt;a href=\"Howardena%20Pindell\"&gt;Howardena Pindell&lt;/a&gt;, John Sims, Kevin Sipp, &lt;a href=\"Al%20Smith\"&gt;Al Smith&lt;/a&gt;, Joyce Wellman, and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20White\"&gt;Jack White&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Rhythm of Structure:\" Beyond the Mathematics (2007).\nIn association with the \"Knotting Mathematics and Art: Conference in Low Dimensional Topology and Mathematical Art\" at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South%20Florida\"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt; in November 2007, there were three exhibitions of \"Rhythm of Structure: Beyond the Mathematics\", curated by John Sims, which were hosted at the Centre Gallery, &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Industry%20%28Tampa%29\"&gt;Museum of Science &amp; Industry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, and the Oliver Gallery, respectively.

The course, \"Rhythm of Structure: Trees, Flags and Clock\", examined the mechanisms/structures of developing John Sims' three large-scale interdisciplinary art projects (as case studies), which explored issues of social justice, community building, and the politics of grand scale works. With these multi-level projects-in-progress, which intersect the space of art with mathematics, visual politics, and social networking, the course investigated the various strategies and challenges in creating a system of objects-texts-sounds-works that employs the tools of social organizing, media, technology, &lt;a href=\"culture%20jamming\"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt;, performance, poetry, and satire.\nThe student final group project was a collective video-poetry response to the &lt;a href=\"Sol%20LeWitt\"&gt;Sol LeWitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Piper\"&gt;Adrian Piper&lt;/a&gt; exhibition, \"Selected Infinite Extensions Arbitrarily Constrained\", which was up at that point at the \"Rhythm of Structure\" exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The video and live student readings were also presented at the closing of the show.\nFilm.\n\"Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection\" was made into a documentary, \"Rhythm of Structure: Bowery and Beyond\", and presented at &lt;a href=\"Sarasota%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Sarasota Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The film was also previewed and reviewed by the \"Saratosa Herald Tribune\".\nIn connection to the film screening, there was are dinner, art performance reception featuring John Sims and Karen Finley's Square of Love installation from the Rhythm of Structure exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The dinner featured a special menu prepared by Chef Gene Marra inspired by roots and love. The performance program included Twinkle, the late Kenny Drew Jr., Thomas Carabasi, Eleonora Lvov, Nate Jacobs, Michael Mendez, Kyleelise Holmes, Greg Tate and Bahiyyah Maroon.\nReviews.\nThere have been a number of reviews for \"Rhythm of Structure\":"
