    "text": "Lakas\u2013CMD (Lakas ng Tao\u2013Christian Muslim Democrats), popularly known as Lakas, was a &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. Its ideology and that of its successor is heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Christian%20democracy\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20democracy\"&gt;Islamic democracy&lt;/a&gt;. The party's influence on &lt;a href=\"Philippine\"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; society is very strong, especially after the &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Revolution\"&gt;People Power Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which has led the country to elect two presidents from the party, namely &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20V.%20Ramos\"&gt;Fidel V. Ramos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist\"&gt;United Methodist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2009, Lakas\u2013CMD merged with Arroyo's &lt;a href=\"Kabalikat%20ng%20Malayang%20Pilipino\"&gt;Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino&lt;/a&gt;, thereby being known as &lt;a href=\"Lakas%E2%80%93CMD\"&gt;Lakas\u2013Kampi\u2013CMD&lt;/a&gt;, a completely new entity. In May 2012, Lakas\u2013Kampi\u2013CMD renamed itself again as Lakas\u2013CMD after the separation of KAMPI.\nIdeology.\nLakas-CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present &lt;a href=\"presidential%20system\"&gt;presidential system&lt;/a&gt; to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; separatists and &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.\nHistory.\nEarly days and Ramos administration.\nIn late 1985, the &lt;a href=\"Partido%20Demokratiko%20Pilipino-Lakas%20ng%20Bayan\"&gt;Partido Demokratiko Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; (founded in February 1982), &lt;a href=\"Lakas%20ng%20Bayan\"&gt;Lakas ng Bayan&lt;/a&gt; (LABAN), and Lakas ng Bansa parties united to form the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nationalist%20Democratic%20Organization\"&gt;United Nationalist Democratic Organization&lt;/a&gt; (UNIDO) coalition. The alliance supported the candidacies of housewife &lt;a href=\"Corazon%20Aquino\"&gt;Corazon C. Aquino&lt;/a&gt; and former Member of the &lt;a href=\"Interim%20Batasang%20Pambansa\"&gt;Interim Batasang Pambansa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Laurel\"&gt;Salvador H. Laurel&lt;/a&gt; for President and Vice President, respectively, in the &lt;a href=\"1986%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;February 7, 1986 snap election&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1986, the PDP had formally merged with LABAN, the party founded in 1978 by Senator &lt;a href=\"Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;Benigno Aquino Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Corazon Aquino's husband, to form the &lt;a href=\"PDP%E2%80%93Laban\"&gt;PDP\u2013Laban&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the May 1987 legislative elections, UNIDO, under the name \"Lakas ng Bayan\", became the dominant party in both Houses of Congress, electing Representative &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Mitra%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Ramon Mitra, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Palawan\"&gt;Palawan&lt;/a&gt; as Speaker of the House of Representatives. UNIDO would be dissolved soon after.\nIn mid-1988, &lt;a href=\"PDP%E2%80%93Laban\"&gt;PDP\u2013Laban&lt;/a&gt; was split into two factions: the Pimentel Wing of Senator &lt;a href=\"Aquilino%20Pimentel%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; of Misamis Oriental and the Cojuangco Wing of Tarlac Representative &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Cojuangco%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Jose \"Peping\" Cojuangco, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;. The Cojuangco Wing and the Lakas ng Bansa party of Speaker Mitra merged on September 16, 1988 to form the &lt;a href=\"Laban%20ng%20Demokratikong%20Pilipino\"&gt;Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; party while the Pimentel Wing remained as the PDP\u2013Laban party.\nIn 1991, as LDP was preparing for its plans for the upcoming &lt;a href=\"1992%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 1992 national elections&lt;/a&gt;, several well-known politicians in the country jockeyed the party to get its nomination for several national positions. In the same year, President Cory Aquino's &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20National%20Defense%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;National Defense Secretary&lt;/a&gt; and retired General &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20V.%20Ramos\"&gt;Fidel V. Ramos&lt;/a&gt; joined the party in order to gain its support for his 1992 presidential bid.\nOn November 30, 1991, LDP, then the nation's largest &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt;, held a national convention to select its presidential and vice presidential candidates for the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1992 Philippine presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. In the convention, Mitra and Ramos vied for the presidential nomination. After losing the nomination to Mitra, Ramos cried foul and bolted the party in December 1991. He later founded the United People Power Movement (UPPM) together with then-&lt;a href=\"Pangasinan\"&gt;Pangasinan&lt;/a&gt; 4th District Representative &lt;a href=\"Jose%20de%20Venecia%20Jr.\"&gt;Jose de Venecia Jr.&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1992, the party's name was changed to Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party). Upon the initiative of Congressman de Venecia, Ramos merged the party with the National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD), a cluster of the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Progressive Party of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; founded in 1968 by former Senator &lt;a href=\"Raul%20Manglapus\"&gt;Raul Manglapus&lt;/a&gt; as the Christian Democratic Socialist Movement. As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao\u2014National Union of Christian Democrats, with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas\u2013NUCD.\nRamos invited then-&lt;a href=\"Cebu\"&gt;Cebu&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href=\"Lito%20Osme%C3%B1a\"&gt;Emilio Mario Osme\u00f1a Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to be his running-mate for the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1992 elections&lt;/a&gt;. Ramos won the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;May 11, 1992&lt;/a&gt; election, garnering 23.58% of the vote and defeating former &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20Agrarian%20Reform\"&gt;Agrarian Reform Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miriam%20Defensor%20Santiago\"&gt;Miriam Defensor-Santiago&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Reform%20Party\"&gt;People's Reform Party&lt;/a&gt;, Speaker Mitra and four other presidential contenders. Osme\u00f1a lost the vice-presidential election, placing third behind Senator &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Estrada\"&gt;Joseph E. Estrada&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20People%27s%20Coalition\"&gt;Nationalist People's Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and Mitra's running mate, former &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Chief Justice of the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Fernan\"&gt;Marcelo B. Fernan&lt;/a&gt;. Santiago cried fraud and filed an electoral protest citing power outages as evidence. Her protest was eventually dismissed by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Supreme Court of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in a technicality.\nSince Ramos got a low plurality in the election, de Venecia created the \"Rainbow Coalition\", converging political parties that include Lakas, &lt;a href=\"Laban%20ng%20Demokratikong%20Pilipino\"&gt;LDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20People%27s%20Coalition\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, and other minor parties to make a solid majority in the House. In late 1994, it formed a coalition government with the &lt;a href=\"Laban%20ng%20Demokratikong%20Pilipino\"&gt;LDP&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;1995 Philippine legislative elections&lt;/a&gt;. This coalition, dubbed the \"&lt;a href=\"Lakas-Laban%20Coalition\"&gt;Lakas\u2014Laban Coalition&lt;/a&gt;\", won a majority in &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;both Houses of Congress&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997, the party was joined by another Progressive Party cluster, the United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (UMDP) of Ambassador Sanchez A. Ali, thereby changing the party's name to Lakas ng Tao\u2014National Union of Christian Democrats\u2014United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (Lakas\u2014NUCD\u2014UMDP).\nIn November 1997, Lakas held its National Convention to select its nominees for the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 1998 national elections.&lt;/a&gt; The long list of contenders for the presidential nomination had been abridged which resulted in a close nominal fight between President Fidel V. Ramos's two leading political lieutenants, House Speaker Jose de Venecia and National Defense Secretary &lt;a href=\"Renato%20de%20Villa\"&gt;Renato de Villa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Batangas\"&gt;Batangas&lt;/a&gt;. After two rounds of secret balloting that month, de Venecia won the nomination and was officially proclaimed by Ramos as the Lakas\u2014NUCD\u2014UMDP presidential nominee for the 1998 elections.\nAfter losing the nomination, Secretary de Villa protested and eventually bolted the party. He later formed &lt;a href=\"Partido%20para%20sa%20Demokratikong%20Reporma\"&gt;Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma&lt;/a&gt; (Party for Democratic Reform) and selected Pangasinan Governor &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Orbos\"&gt;Oscar Orbos&lt;/a&gt; as his vice-presidential running-mate for the 1998 polls. De Villa's Reporma and Orbos's &lt;a href=\"Lapiang%20Manggagawa\"&gt;Lapiang Manggagawa&lt;/a&gt; coalesced and formed the Reporma\u2014Lapiang Manggagawa coalition.\nFormer Cebu Governor Emilio Osme\u00f1a, who also contended for the Lakas presidential nomination, also left the party and later launched his presidential bid under his newly-formed party, &lt;a href=\"PROMDI\"&gt;Probinsya Muna Development Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (PROMDI), with Assembly Member of the Southern Philippine Council for Peace and Development &lt;a href=\"Ismael%20Sueno\"&gt;Ismael Sueno&lt;/a&gt; as running-mate for vice president.\nMeanwhile, Lakas nominated then-Senator &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pampanga\"&gt;Pampanga&lt;/a&gt; as its candidate for vice president. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, &lt;a href=\"Kabalikat%20ng%20Malayang%20Pilipino\"&gt;Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; (KAMPI). Arroyo joined Lakas to become the official candidate of the party.\nDe Venecia lost the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Philippine%20presidential%20election\"&gt;May 11, 1998 election&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; Joseph E. Estrada of &lt;a href=\"Laban%20ng%20Makabayang%20Masang%20Pilipino\"&gt;Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; (LAMMP) by a significant plurality. Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner as Estrada, defeating Estrada's running mate, Senator &lt;a href=\"Edgardo%20Angara\"&gt;Edgardo Angara&lt;/a&gt;. Arroyo emerged victorious in the vice-presidential race while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\nArroyo administration.\nIn early 2004, the party's name was shortened and changed into the current Lakas\u2014Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas\u2014CMD). However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng EDSA\" (\"The Strength of EDSA\") than the original \"Lakas ng Tao\" (\"The Strength of the People\"/\"People Power\"). This is also the name that the party used when it participated in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 10, 2004 general elections&lt;/a&gt; as a leading member of the &lt;a href=\"Koalisyon%20ng%20Katapatan%20at%20Karanasan%20sa%20Kinabukasan\"&gt;K4 Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. President Gloria Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Estrada\"&gt;Joseph Estrada&lt;/a&gt;, was the K4 Coalition candidate for President in the May 2004 presidential election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily movie actor &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Poe%20Jr.\"&gt;Fernando Poe Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href=\"Panfilo%20Lacson\"&gt;Panfilo Lacson&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Poe's unsuccessful bid to the presidency, his supporters, which also included Estrada supporters, viewed the election results as fraudulent, and came under legal protest by Poe and his vice-presidential running-mate, former Senator &lt;a href=\"Loren%20Legarda\"&gt;Loren Legarda&lt;/a&gt;. The poll protest was later thrown out by the Supreme Court acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, as well as Legarda's protest.\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas\u2014CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President Fidel V. Ramos. Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap &lt;a href=\"2007%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;mid-term elections&lt;/a&gt; (or \"\"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\"\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\nThere are no official results available of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 2007 elections&lt;/a&gt; released by the party, but according to the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Philippine House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, the party held 79 out of 235 seats.\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas\u2014CMD spokesman and legal counsel &lt;a href=\"Raul%20Lambino\"&gt;Raul Lambino&lt;/a&gt; stated that Lakas\u2014CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for &lt;a href=\"2010%20Philippine%20Senate%20election\"&gt;2010.&lt;/a&gt; Except for Para\u00f1aque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. However, Lambino named incumbent Senators &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Revilla%20Jr.\"&gt;Ramon Revilla Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lito%20Lapid\"&gt;Lito Lapid&lt;/a&gt;, former senator &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Recto\"&gt;Ralph Recto&lt;/a&gt; and former Congressman &lt;a href=\"Prospero%20Pichay\"&gt;Prospero Pichay&lt;/a&gt; as among those considered.\nDe Venecia's resignation\nFormer House Speaker de Venecia resigned his post as president of Lakas on March 10, 2008, and rejected the proposition of former President Ramos to give him the title Chairman Emeritus. The current Speaker of the House &lt;a href=\"Prospero%20Nograles\"&gt;Prospero Nograles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Davao%20City%27s%201st%20congressional%20district\"&gt;(Davao City\u20141st District)&lt;/a&gt; was sworn-in as the new party president and former House Speaker &lt;a href=\"Feliciano%20Belmonte%20Jr.\"&gt;Feliciano Belmonte Jr.&lt;/a&gt; as Vice President for Metro Manila Affairs on the same day.\nMerger with KAMPI.\nOn June 18, 2008, President Gloria Arroyo confirmed the historical merger of the Lakas\u2014CMD and the &lt;a href=\"Kabalikat%20ng%20Malayang%20Pilipino\"&gt;Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the \u201cequity of the incumbent\u201d principle, as the merger will account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid President Arroyo's prediction of &lt;a href=\"2010%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 2010 elections&lt;/a&gt; victory. Lakas\u2014CMD President &lt;a href=\"Prospero%20Nograles\"&gt;Prospero Nograles&lt;/a&gt; and KAMPI Chairman &lt;a href=\"Ronaldo%20Puno\"&gt;Ronaldo Puno&lt;/a&gt; signed the covenant at the regional &lt;a href=\"caucus\"&gt;caucus&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Davao%20City\"&gt;Davao City&lt;/a&gt;. Ramos, the party chairman-emeritus, announced on February 6, 2008 that Lakas\u2014CMD would be the surviving entity after its merger with &lt;a href=\"Kabalikat%20ng%20Malayang%20Pilipino\"&gt;KAMPI&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 9, 2009, &lt;a href=\"Jose%20de%20Venecia%20Jr.\"&gt;de Venecia Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20V.%20Ramos\"&gt;Ramos&lt;/a&gt; led fifty members from the Lakas\u2014Kampi\u2014CMD in objecting to its merger with KAMPI on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as its Chairman Emeritus. However, Ramos later refused the offer of being the party's chairman-emeritus after being named in the interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20on%20Elections%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Commission on Elections&lt;/a&gt; to declare \"null and void\" the merger. However, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ultimately upheld the legality of the merger, citing the failure of de Venecia \u201cto sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20on%20Elections\"&gt;Commission on Elections&lt;/a&gt; in rendering the challenged resolution.\u201d\nElectoral performance.\n1998.\nLakas put up a full senatorial slate during the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 11, 1998 national elections&lt;/a&gt;, as it propels the machinery of its candidates House Speaker &lt;a href=\"Jose%20de%20Venecia\"&gt;Jose de Venecia&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo\"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; to the presidency and vice presidency respectively against the &lt;a href=\"Laban%20ng%20Makabayang%20Masang%20Pilipino\"&gt;Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino&lt;/a&gt; (\"Struggle of Patriotic Filipino Masses\") coalition of the opposition led by Vice President &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Estrada\"&gt;Joseph Estrada&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href=\"Edgardo%20Angara\"&gt;Edgardo Angara&lt;/a&gt;.\nLakas-CMD gained 5 out of 12 possible seats in the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; namely: (in order of votes received)\n2010.\nBelow is a list of Lakas senatorial bets for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;May 10, 2010 national elections&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being the dominant majority party, Lakas\u2014Kampi\u2014CMD fielded only six candidates. \nOnly re-electionist senators &lt;a href=\"Bong%20Revilla%20Jr.\"&gt;Bong Revilla Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lito%20Lapid\"&gt;Lito Lapid&lt;/a&gt; won. Revilla was able to garner 19,513,521 votes, setting the record for the most votes received by any candidate for any position in any Philippine election.\nCoalitions.\nLakas\u2014CMD had coalesced with other parties in the past elections, enabling it to strengthen its political power both in the national and local levels:"
