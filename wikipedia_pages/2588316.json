    "text": "Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) is a &lt;a href=\"fluorine\"&gt;fluorine&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed to have high corrosion resistance and strength over a wide temperature range. ETFE is a &lt;a href=\"polymer\"&gt;polymer&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"IUPAC%20polymer%20nomenclature\"&gt;source-based name&lt;/a&gt; is poly(ethene-co-tetrafluoroethene). It is also known under the brand name Tefzel. ETFE has a relatively high melting temperature and excellent chemical, electrical and high-energy radiation resistance properties. When burned, ETFE releases &lt;a href=\"hydrofluoric%20acid\"&gt;hydrofluoric acid&lt;/a&gt;.\nProperties.\nUseful comparison tables of &lt;a href=\"PTFE\"&gt;PTFE&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Fluorinated%20ethylene%20propylene\"&gt;FEP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perfluoroalkoxy\"&gt;PFA&lt;/a&gt; and ETFE can be found on DuPont's website, listing the mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, and vapour properties of each, side by side.\nETFE is effectively the high-strength version of the other three in this group, often featuring slightly diminished capacities in other fields by comparison.\nCombustion of ETFE occurs in the same way as a number of other &lt;a href=\"fluoropolymer\"&gt;fluoropolymer&lt;/a&gt;s, in terms of releasing hydrofluoric acid (HF). HF is extremely corrosive and toxic, and so appropriate caution must be exercised.\nETFE film is self-cleaning (due to its nonstick surface) and recyclable. It is prone to punctures by sharp edges and therefore mostly used for roofs. As a film for roofing it can be stretched and still be taut if some variation in size, such as that caused by thermal expansion, were to occur. Employing heat welding, tears can be repaired with a patch or multiple sheets assembled into larger panels.\nETFE has an approximate tensile strength of 42 MPa (6100 psi), with a working temperature range of to ( to or to ).\nETFE resins are resistant to ultraviolet light. An &lt;a href=\"Weather%20testing%20of%20polymers%23Artificial%20weathering\"&gt;artificial weathering&lt;/a&gt; test (comparable to 30 years\u2019 exposure) produced almost no signs of film deterioration.\nApplications.\nETFE was developed by &lt;a href=\"DuPont\"&gt;DuPont&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s initially as a lightweight heat resistant film in the aerospace industry. From its development it was largely used infrequently in agricultural and architectural projects. ETFE's first large-scale use architecturally came in 2001 at the &lt;a href=\"Eden%20Project\"&gt;Eden Project&lt;/a&gt; where ETFE was selected as it can be printed and layered to control solar conditions and because it was found to have a low friction coefficient, which saves on maintenance as dust and dirt do not stick.\nAn example of its use is as &lt;a href=\"pneumatic\"&gt;pneumatic&lt;/a&gt; panels to cover the outside of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allianz%20Arena\"&gt;Allianz Arena&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Beijing%20National%20Aquatics%20Centre\"&gt;Beijing National Aquatics Centre&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. the Water Cube of the 2008 Olympics) \u2013 the world's largest &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; made of ETFE film (&lt;a href=\"laminate\"&gt;laminate&lt;/a&gt;). The panels of the &lt;a href=\"Eden%20Project\"&gt;Eden Project&lt;/a&gt; are also made from ETFE, and the &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Islands\"&gt;Tropical Islands&lt;/a&gt; have a 20,000 m2 window made from this &lt;a href=\"translucent\"&gt;translucent&lt;/a&gt; material.\nAnother key use of ETFE is for the covering of electrical and fiber-optic wiring used in high-stress, low-fume-toxicity and high-reliability situations. Aircraft, spacecraft and motorsport wiring are primary examples. Some small cross-section wires like the wire used for the &lt;a href=\"wire-wrap\"&gt;wire-wrap&lt;/a&gt; technique are coated with ETFE.\nAs a dual laminate, ETFE can be bonded with &lt;a href=\"Fibre-reinforced%20plastic\"&gt;FRP&lt;/a&gt; as a thermoplastic liner and used in pipes, tanks, and vessels for additional corrosion protection.\nETFE is commonly used in the &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20industry\"&gt;nuclear industry&lt;/a&gt; for tie or cable wraps and in the aviation and aerospace industries for wire coatings. This is because ETFE has better mechanical toughness than &lt;a href=\"polytetrafluoroethylene\"&gt;PTFE&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, ETFE exhibits a high-energy radiation resistance and can withstand moderately high temperatures for a long period. \nCommercially deployed brand names of ETFE include \"Tefzel\" by &lt;a href=\"DuPont\"&gt;DuPont&lt;/a&gt;, \"Fluon\" by &lt;a href=\"Asahi%20Glass%20Company\"&gt;Asahi Glass Company&lt;/a&gt;, \"Neoflon ETFE\" by &lt;a href=\"Daikin\"&gt;Daikin&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Texlon\" by &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Foiltec\"&gt;Vector Foiltec&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to its high temperature resistance ETFE is also used in film mode as a mold-release film. ETFE film offered by Guarniflon or Airtech International and Honeywell is used in aerospace applications such as carbon fiber &lt;a href=\"pre-preg\"&gt;pre-preg&lt;/a&gt; curing as a release film for molds or hot high-pressure plates.\nNotable buildings.\nNotable buildings and designs using ETFE as a significant architectural element:"
