    "text": "The Haese Memorial Village Historic District is located in &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Junction%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Forest Junction, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe site is a remnant business district of a town that formed where two railroads crossed, then withered as logging faded, as the automobile replaced the train, and as Appleton grew. Structures include the 1884 Haese General Store, the 1908 Hunt hardware store, a summer kitchen, and the 1908 Haese gas station.\nCurrently, the site serves as a museum. It was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 and on the State Register of Historic Places in 1989."
