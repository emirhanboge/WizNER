    "text": "Henry George Hamlet Hall (24 December 1857 \u2013 13 February 1934) played &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Somerset&lt;/a&gt; from 1879 to 1887; two of the matches he played for the team were &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class&lt;/a&gt; games. He was born at &lt;a href=\"Bedminster%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Bedminster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and died at &lt;a href=\"Southmead%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Southmead&lt;/a&gt;, also in Bristol.\nHall, a lower-order batsman and a bowler whose bowling style is unknown, has the distinction of taking the first wicket ever taken by Somerset in an authenticated first-class match when he had &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; opening batsman and captain &lt;a href=\"A.%20N.%20Hornby\"&gt;Albert Hornby&lt;/a&gt; caught in the match at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; on 8 June 1882, and he followed it with a catch to dismiss the second Lancashire batsman, &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Robinson%20%28cricketer%29\"&gt;Walter Robinson&lt;/a&gt;. There were no other successes for Hall in this game: no more catches, wickets or runs when he batted and he then did not play against for Somerset in any first-class fixture for three years. By the time he reappeared for a single game in 1885 against &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;, whose team included &lt;a href=\"W.%20G.%20Grace\"&gt;W. G. Grace&lt;/a&gt;, he was being played as an opening batsman: to no great effect, as he scored 0 and 2 and Somerset lost very heavily. Though Hall went on to play minor matches for a further 10 years, this was his last first-class cricket game."
