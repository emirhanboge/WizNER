    "text": "Stan Jones (born January 13, 1943) is a &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; politician who has twice run unsuccessfully for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2002%20United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Montana\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%20United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Montana\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, and three times unsuccessfully as the Libertarian nominee for &lt;a href=\"governor%20of%20Montana\"&gt;governor of Montana&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2000%20Montana%20gubernatorial%20election\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2004%20Montana%20gubernatorial%20election\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2008%20Montana%20gubernatorial%20election\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. He is known for his artificially induced blue-grey skin tone.\nMedical condition.\nIn his book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Disappearing%20Spoon\"&gt;The Disappearing Spoon&lt;/a&gt;\", about the periodic table, author &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Kean\"&gt;Sam Kean&lt;/a&gt; chronicled the experience of Jones, who developed &lt;a href=\"argyria\"&gt;argyria&lt;/a&gt;, which permanently turned his skin a blue-grey color, by consuming large quantities of home-made &lt;a href=\"colloidal%20silver\"&gt;colloidal silver&lt;/a&gt;. Jones' purposeful consumption of silver, which he believed to be an antibiotic, was a measure he undertook in response to his fears that the &lt;a href=\"Year%202000%20problem\"&gt;Y2K problem&lt;/a&gt; would make &lt;a href=\"antibiotics\"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; unavailable, an event that did not occur. The peculiar coloration of his skin featured prominently in media coverage of his unsuccessful campaign. Jones is reported to have said, given the chance to go back, he would do it all over again. Jones is not alone in his beliefs; the use of colloidal silver has found support among some notables, such as actress &lt;a href=\"Gwyneth%20Paltrow\"&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infowars\"&gt;Infowars&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Jones\"&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt;. However, regarding colloidal silver, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Institutes%20of%20Health\"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; have stated that \u201cevidence supporting health-related claims is lacking\u201d.\nPolicy stances.\nHis stances on policy issues tend to be socially &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;; among other issues, he supports the &lt;a href=\"death%20penalty\"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;, opposes &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;, and has called &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; a \"&lt;a href=\"crime%20against%20humanity\"&gt;crime against humanity&lt;/a&gt;.\" During the senatorial debate held on October 9, 2006, Jones proposed that a collaboration of &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and North American elites are on the verge of forming a \"&lt;a href=\"one%20world%20government\"&gt;one world&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; government.\"\nPersonal life.\nHe currently works as a business consultant in Bozeman, the seat of &lt;a href=\"Gallatin%20County%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Gallatin County&lt;/a&gt;."
