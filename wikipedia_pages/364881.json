    "text": "Chernivtsi ( ; ; see also ) is a city in &lt;a href=\"western%20Ukraine\"&gt;western Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated on the upper course of the &lt;a href=\"Prut%20River\"&gt;Prut River&lt;/a&gt;, and is the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20%28political%29\"&gt;administrative center&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Oblast\"&gt;Chernivtsi Oblast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"oblast\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;), which includes the Ukrainian part of &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt;. Chernivtsi is also the administrative center of &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Raion%2C%20Chernivtsi%20Oblast\"&gt;Chernivtsi Raion&lt;/a&gt; and hosts the administration of the &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20urban%20hromada\"&gt;Chernivtsi urban hromada&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"hromada\"&gt;hromada&lt;/a&gt;s of Ukraine. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Census%20%282001%29\"&gt;2001 Ukrainian Census&lt;/a&gt;, the population of the city was 240,600. The current population is \nChernivtsi is viewed as one of Western Ukraine's main cultural centers. The city is also considered one of Ukraine's important educational and architectural sites. Inhabited by Early Slavic tribes since the 2nd or 5th century AD, the area in which present-day Chernivtsi is located became part of &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;Kievan Rus'&lt;/a&gt; in the 9th-11th century. Chernivtsi was also part, for almost four centuries, of the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Principality of Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;. Located on the border with Poland, the city flourished enjoying a high degree of autonomy. The city, along with the rest of Moldavia, came under Turkish control in 1538, and was later devastated by the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;. Russians and Swedes pillaged the city, which by 1762 had shrunk to a settlement of hardly 200 wooden buildings and about a thousand inhabitants. After passing to Austria in 1775, the city's population, economy and architectural landscape grew exponentially. Historically a cosmopolitan community, Chernivtsi was once dubbed \"Little &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; upon the &lt;a href=\"Prut\"&gt;Prut&lt;/a&gt;\". Chernivtsi is &lt;a href=\"Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with seven other cities around the world. The city is a major regional rail and road transportation hub, also housing an &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20International%20Airport\"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nNames.\nAside from its Ukrainian name of Chernivtsi, the city is also known by several different names in various languages, which still are used by the respective population groups much as they used to be throughout the city's history, either in connection with the rule by one country or another or independently from it: ; ; ; , , , &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Russian\"&gt;translit.&lt;/a&gt; \"Chernovtsy\" (In Russian until 1944: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0301\u0446\u044b, &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Russian\"&gt;translit.&lt;/a&gt; \"Chernovitsy\"). In the times of Halych-Volyn Principality the city's name was \"Chern\".\nIn \"Documents of Western Russia\" () published in Saint Petersburg in 1846 (Volume 1, page 32, document #21), the city is mentioned as Chernov'tsi ().\nHistory.\nArchaeological evidence discovered in the area surrounding Chernivtsi indicates that a population inhabited it since the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; era. Later settlements included those of the &lt;a href=\"Cucuteni-Trypillian%20culture\"&gt;Cucuteni-Trypillian culture&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Corded%20Ware%20culture\"&gt;Corded Ware culture&lt;/a&gt;; artifacts from the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;s were also found in the city. Archaeological finds in the area around Chernivtsi show that the area was inhabited by a Slavic population by the 2nd / 5th century AD.\nIn the Middle Ages there lived the East Slavic tribes of &lt;a href=\"White%20Croats\"&gt;White Croats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tivertsi\"&gt;Tivertsi&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fortified settlement located on the left (north-eastern) shore of the Prut dating back to the time of the &lt;a href=\"Galicia-Volhynia\"&gt;Principality of Halych&lt;/a&gt; was built by &lt;a href=\"Knyaz\"&gt;Grand Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yaroslav%20Osmomysl\"&gt;Yaroslav Osmomysl&lt;/a&gt; in the second half of the 12th century. In the List of Ruthenian Cities Far and Near (c. 1370) there is a settlement &lt;a href=\"Chern%20on%20the%20Prut\"&gt;Chern on the Prut&lt;/a&gt; located in the northwestern part of modern Chernivtsi.\nIt is said that Chernivtsi owes its name to the black color of the city walls, built from dark &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; layered with &lt;a href=\"chernozem\"&gt;local black-colored soil&lt;/a&gt;. Chern was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Mongol invasion of Europe&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Boroldai\"&gt;Boroldai&lt;/a&gt; in the 13th century. However, the remaining ramparts of the fortress were still used for defense purposes. The ruins of Chern are still preserved. \nIn the 17th century the ramparts were augmented with several bastions, one of which is still extant.\nFollowing the destruction of the fortress, later settlements in the area centered on the right (south-western) shore of the Prut River, at a more strategically advantageous, elevated location. According to Romanian scholars, in 1325, when the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281025%E2%80%931385%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;, and came into contact with the early &lt;a href=\"Vlachs\"&gt;Vlach&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;) feudal formations, a fort was mentioned under the name \"\u021ae\u021bina\"; it was defending the ford and crossing point on the &lt;a href=\"Prut%20River\"&gt;Prut River&lt;/a&gt;. It was part of a group of three fortifications; the other two being the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Khotyn\"&gt;Hotin&lt;/a&gt; on the Dniester to the east, and a fort on the &lt;a href=\"Kolachin%20River\"&gt;Kolachin River&lt;/a&gt;, an upriver tributary of Prut.\nFrom the late 14th century until 1775 the city was part of the &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Principality of Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the historic provinces of &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;; the city being the administrative center of the &lt;a href=\"Cern%D7%93u%C8%9Bi%20County\"&gt;homonymous \"\u021binut\" (county)&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; sources, the city was mentioned as \"\u05b7ernovi\", a phonetic transliteration of a Latin cognomen meaning \"new castle\" (see French &lt;a href=\"Castelnau%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Castelnau&lt;/a&gt; or Welsh &lt;a href=\"Carno\"&gt;Carno&lt;/a&gt;). The city of Chern, after its reconstruction, became known as \"Chernivtsi\". It is mentioned in this variation for the first time in 1408 (8 October 1408). Standing at the border between the Ukrainian/Moldavian Principality of Moldavia and Poland, the city was ran through by a trade route between Lviv and Souceava. Its earliest reference appears in the context of the collection of excise taxes (&lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20language\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;: \"chernovskoe myto\"), in a treaty between Stephen of Moldavia and the merchants of Lviv. During the Moldavian period the city enjoyed a high degree of autonomy, in fact becoming a \"&lt;a href=\"Magdeburg%20rights\"&gt;free city&lt;/a&gt;.\" The city flourished thanks to trade and international fairs. However, by the mid-16th century it went into decline to due to wars. Chernivtsi was sacked in 1497, 1509, and 1688, during the Moldavian-Polish wars, as well as during the Turkish wars (1476, 1714) and the Crimean Tatar wars (1626, 1646, 1650, 1672).\nIn 1538 Moldavia, including Chernivtsi, succumbed to Ottoman domination. &lt;a href=\"Tymofiy%20Khmelnytsky\"&gt;Tymofiy Khmelnytsky&lt;/a&gt; led the Cossacks to Chernivtsi in 1650 and 1653, and also &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Mazepa\"&gt;Ivan Mazepa&lt;/a&gt; wintered there in 1709, in the aftermath of the defeat at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Poltava\"&gt;Poltava&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, the city was sacked by the Russians and Swedes. During the Russian-Turkish wars, the city was sacked again by the Russians (1739). The Russians kidnapped a large amount of citizens as they retreated. Conflicts and invasions caused Chernivtsi to \"shrink to a small settlement\" by the 18th century. In 1762 the city consisted of hardly 200 wooden buildings. Its population of 1,200 was made up of boyars, merchants, loan sharks and poor people, who often revolted against injustices, having to resort to &lt;a href=\"banditry\"&gt;banditry&lt;/a&gt; (the \"&lt;a href=\"Opryshoks\"&gt;Opryshoks&lt;/a&gt;\").\nAfter being occupied by the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u201374, in 1775 the city passed to the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Empire&lt;/a&gt;; part of the region known as Bukovina, the city became the region's capital. From 1786 to 1849 it was part of the crownland of &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1849 Bukovina was raised in status and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Bukovina\"&gt;Duchy of Bukovina&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cisleithania%23Crown%20lands\"&gt;crownland&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The city enjoyed again &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg%20rights\"&gt;Magdeburg rights&lt;/a&gt;. The city began to flourish in 1778 when Knight &lt;a href=\"Karl%20von%20Enzenberg\"&gt;Karl von Enzenberg&lt;/a&gt; was appointed the chief of the Military Administration. He invited many merchants, craftsmen and entrepreneurs to help develop trade and other businesses. &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Saint Peter&lt;/a&gt;'s Fairs (1\u201315 July) had given a new vibrant impulse to the market development from 1786. In the late 19th century the German language\u2014due to the Habsburg and the very important Jewish influence\u2014became the lingua franca and more and more newspapers were edited in German, also a remarkable literary production in German began in this period, featuring most prominently &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Emil%20Franzos\"&gt;Karl Emil Franzos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Austrians the city flourished, and increased its extinguishing population. By 1779, the city had passed from a thousand inhabitants to 3,200. The city continued to grow thanks to an influx of migrants (Germans, Poles, Romanians, Ukrainians, among others). Craft guilds were established and industry developed in the late 18th century. Stone buildings were erected, and in the 19th century important public buildings such as the city's gymnasium (built between 1813 and 1817), as well as private buildings of four floors and more, and several churches where built. A public park was constructed in 1830, and in 1832 a municipal council with a burgomaster at its head was created. Between then and 1877, a distillery, a brewery a steam mill, tile factory, a chamber of commerce, a stock exchange were built and telegraph communications installed. In 1866 the Lviv-Chernivtsi railroad was completed, and an electric power station was added in 1895, followed by an electric streetcar system in 1897.\nSewage and water supply systems were installed in between 1895 and 1912. The Orthodox cathedral was built in this period, as well as the Armenian church, the Jesuit church, and the Jewish synagogue. In the 20th century a city theater and railway station were added. By the early 20th century the city had over 100,000 inhabitants. Two thousand five hundred employers were working in Chernivtsi's factories, and by 1910 1,400 merchants and 2,140 tradesmen were active in the city. The city was the see of the Orthodox bishop\u2015from 1873 the metropolitan.\nThe &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt; brought an end to serfdom, which had been in use until then in Bukovina.\nUntil 1781 there was only one elementary school in Chernivtsi, teaching in Romanian. The Austrians opened also a number of German schools in the city. The Chernivtsi University was established in 1875. In the university there were chairs in the Ukrainian language, which was introduced as a subject in 1851, and was thereupon thought at the teachers' seminary. The university attracted students from other parts of Galicia and Bukovina. 1896 saw the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Gymnasium%20of%20Chernivtsi\"&gt;Ukrainian Gymnasium of Chernivtsi&lt;/a&gt; in the city.\nBy the end of its membership in the Austrian Empire, there were Ukrainian-language elementary schools in Chernivtsi, four in total. Ukrainian organizations grew in Chernivtsi in the second half of the 19th century, with the &lt;a href=\"Ruska%20Besida%20in%20Bukovyna\"&gt;Ruska Besida in Bukovyna&lt;/a&gt; founded in 1869; the &lt;a href=\"Ruska%20Rada%20Society\"&gt;Ruska Rada&lt;/a&gt; society in 1870, and Soiuz, a student society, in 1875, the cultural/educational society &lt;a href=\"Mishchanska%20Chytalnia\"&gt;Mishchanska Chytalnia&lt;/a&gt; in 1880 and the Ukrainian People\u2019s Home society in 1884. Such prominent Ukrainian writers as &lt;a href=\"Yuriy%20Fedkovych\"&gt;Yuriy Fedkovych&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sydir%20Vorobkevych\"&gt;Sydir Vorobkevych&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Olha%20Kobylianska\"&gt;Olha Kobylianska&lt;/a&gt;, were all Ukrainian Bukovinians quite close to Chernivtsi. Such organizations were initially Russophile. However, Ukrainians eventually prevailed, thanks to such figures as populists (\"narodovtsi\") &lt;a href=\"Yerotei%20Pihuliak\"&gt;Yerotei Pihuliak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omelian%20Popovych\"&gt;Omelian Popovych&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stepan%20Smal-Stotsky\"&gt;Stepan Smal-Stotsky&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The Ukrainian national movement grew rapidly thanks to them. The center of Ukrainian cultural life became the aforementioned Ukrainian People\u2019s Home society, and in 1887 the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainska%20Shkola\"&gt;Ukrainska Shkola&lt;/a&gt; was also founded here. Loan association Ruska Kasa was founded in 1896, and the Selianska Kasa, a union of agricultural credit associations, in 1903. The &lt;a href=\"%20Women%27s%20Hromada%20in%20Bukovyna\"&gt; Women's Hromada in Bukovyna&lt;/a&gt;, a Bukovinian cultural and charitable association of Ukrainian women, was founded in 1906 in Chernivtsi. The sportive Sich Union was founded in 1904, and the students' residence Fedkovych Bursa in 1896. The own building of the Fedkovych Bursa was erected in 1906. Musical societies were also opened, with the Bukovynskyi Boian founded in 1895, the Mishchanskyi Khor in 1901, and the Bukovynian People's Theater in 1897. The city became one of the most important Ukrainian publishing center, with a number of newspapers, magazine, literary, teachers' and students' publications, book series, including \"Bukovinskaia zoria\" (1870\u20131); \"Bukovyna\" (1885\u20131918); \"Biblioteka dlia molodezhi, selian i mishchan\" (1885\u201393); \"Kreitsarova biblioteka\" (1902\u20138); \"Pravoslavnyi rus\u2019kyi kalendar\" (1874\u20131918); \"Haslo\" (1902\u20133); \"Narodnyi holos\" (1909\u201315, 1921, 1923), \"Narodna sprava\" (1907\u201310), \"Hromadianyn\" (1909\u201311), and \"Borba\" (1908\u201314).\nThe city was an important center for publishing for Jews, Romanians, Germans, and Poles. Beside Ukrainians, the city became also the center of Romanian national movement. In 1908, it was the site of the first &lt;a href=\"Yiddish%20language\"&gt;Yiddish language&lt;/a&gt; conference, the &lt;a href=\"Czernowitz%20Conference\"&gt;Czernowitz Conference&lt;/a&gt;, coordinated by &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Birnbaum\"&gt;Nathan Birnbaum&lt;/a&gt;. Karl-Emile Franzos, a German writer, popularized &lt;a href=\"Taras%20Shevchenko\"&gt;Taras Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt;. Historian studied the history of Bukovina, with a focus on its &lt;a href=\"Hutsuls\"&gt;Hutsuls&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; in 1918, both the local &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20National%20Council\"&gt;Romanian National Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20National%20Council\"&gt;Ukrainian National Council&lt;/a&gt; based in Galicia claimed the region. In the beginning, Bukovina joined the fledging &lt;a href=\"West%20Ukrainian%20National%20Republic\"&gt;West Ukrainian National Republic&lt;/a&gt; (November 1918), but it was invaded by the Romanian army immediately thereafter, against Ukrainian protests. \nChernivtsi was occupied three times by the Russians during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. The regime that had invaded the city proceeded with persecuting the \"nationally conscious Ukrainians.\" Eventually, the Russians were driven out. &lt;a href=\"Oleksander%20Lototsky\"&gt;Oleksander Lototsky&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Gubernial%20Commissioner%20of%20Bukovyna\"&gt;Gubernial Commissioner of Bukovyna&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 October 1918 the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Regional%20Committee%20of%20Bukovyna\"&gt;Ukrainian Regional Committee of Bukovyna&lt;/a&gt; was formed. A large public assembly was convened in the city, approving the union of Bukovina to the Ukrainian state on November 3, 1918. Ukrainians took control of the city three days later, with &lt;a href=\"Yosyp%20Bezpalko\"&gt;Yosyp Bezpalko&lt;/a&gt; elected mayor. But five days later, Romanian troops invaded Bukovina in spite of Ukrainian resistance, and seized the city. Thus, in addition to southern Bukovina, the Romanian Army also seized the historically solidly Ukrainian northern Bukovina, including Chernivtsi, on November 11. On 28 November, the Romanian General Congress proclaimed Bukovina's union with Romania. \nDuring those two years, even most city residents did not know of which country they were citizens, with most assuming Czernowitz still belonged to Austria-Hungary. German remained the &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; of the city and its suburbs for another decade. Under the Kingdom of Romania in 1930, according to Romanian census, the city reached a population of 112,400: 26.8% &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;, 23.2% &lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;Romanians&lt;/a&gt;, 20.8% &lt;a href=\"Bukovina%20Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;, 18.6% &lt;a href=\"Ukrainians\"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt;, the remainder &lt;a href=\"Polish%20people\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; and others. It was one of the five university centers of interwar Romania.\nUnder Romania, Chernivtsi became the center of Bukovina. In spite of the persecution of Ukrainians by Romanians, however, it also managed to remain the center of Ukrainian culture. So great was this cultural influence, that some new Ukrainian organizations even managed to be founded in Chernivtsi, amid policies of Rumanization in other parts of the region. A new building was also erected at &lt;a href=\"%20Chernivtsi%20University\"&gt; Chernivtsi University&lt;/a&gt;, and a cultural house opened. Yet, the number of Ukrainian publications was drastically decreased. In the 1930s, the city grew economically, as a prominent center. Several mills, factories and plants were opened in the city starting from 1936. In 1936, \"155 large and 61 small firms were located in the city, among them 5 mills, 8 large bakeries, 6 distilleries, 7 meat-packing plants, 16 food-processing plants, 21 chemical plants, 18 metalworking plants, 51 textile factories, 6 furniture factories, and 7 printing shops.\"\nIn 1940, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Bessarabia%20and%20Northern%20Bukovina\"&gt;occupied the area&lt;/a&gt;; the area around the city became known as &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Oblast\"&gt;Chernivtsi Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, and was allotted to the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20SSR\"&gt;Ukrainian SSR&lt;/a&gt; by the Soviet Union. It remained occupied by the Soviet Union from June 1940 to July 1941. Under the regime of military dictator &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Antonescu\"&gt;Ion Antonescu&lt;/a&gt;, Romania had switched from an ally of France and Britain to one of Nazi Germany; subsequently, in July 1941, the Romanian Army retook the city as part of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Axis attack on the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; during World War II. In August 1941, Antonescu ordered the creation of a &lt;a href=\"ghetto\"&gt;ghetto&lt;/a&gt; in the lowland part of the city, where 50,000 &lt;a href=\"Bukovina%20Jews\"&gt;Bukovina Jews&lt;/a&gt; were crammed, two-thirds of whom would be deported in October 1941 and early 1942 to &lt;a href=\"Transnistria%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt;, where the majority perished. The Romanian mayor of the city &lt;a href=\"Traian%20Popovici\"&gt;Traian Popovici&lt;/a&gt; managed to persuade Antonescu to raise the number of Jews exempted from deportation from 200 to 20,000. In 1944, when &lt;a href=\"Axis%20forces\"&gt;Axis forces&lt;/a&gt; were driven out by the Red Army, the city was reincorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. Over the following years, most of the Jews emigrated to Israel; the city was an important node in the &lt;a href=\"Berihah\"&gt;Berihah&lt;/a&gt; network. Bukovina Poles were expelled by the Soviets after World War II. The city became a predominantly Ukrainian one. With the events of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; drastic changes happened to the national make-up of the local population. Ethnic Germans wered deported or otherwise emigrated to Germany; similarly, many ethnic Romanians resettled in Romania. Ukrainian \"cultural and civic life was completely disrupted,\" many leaders were incarcerated, and Ukrainians were resettled. Most notably, many Jews were killed as part of &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. The city suffered greatly, getting also much damaged. \nAfter 1944, the city became the capital of &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Oblast\"&gt;Chernivtsi Oblast&lt;/a&gt;. It was developed \"along the main arteries\" during the Soviet period. Industrial sections\nwere created in the north, central, and southern districts of the city. A natural-gas system was added in 1956. Between 1971 and 1973 a railway bridge was built over the Prut. Several factories were opened, and the city had 60% of the oblast's labor force.\nSince 1991, Chernivtsi has been a part of an independent Ukraine. An Austrian consulate is present in Chernivtsi. In May 1999, Romania opened a &lt;a href=\"consulate%20general\"&gt;consulate general&lt;/a&gt; in the city.\nUntil 18 July 2020, Chernivtsi was designated as a &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20regional%20significance%20%28Ukraine%29\"&gt;city of oblast significance&lt;/a&gt; and did not belong to any raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernivtsi Oblast to three, the city was merged into Chernivtsi Raion.\nSymbolics.\nCoat of arms.\nChernivtsi coat of arms \u2013 framed by a bronze ornamental cartouche, a red heraldic shield depicting an open stone gate with a figured trident in the middle. Under the gate, there are two crossed laurel branches, tied with ribbons. The crown of the symbol is the stone crown.\nFlag of Chernivtsi.\nThe Chernivtsi flag consists of a tree, the top, and a rectangular cloth, the front of which forms framed by a red tooth-like ornament white background with an inscription in Ukrainian in the center, over which there is inscribed in Ukrainian: \"Chernivtsi\". Under the coat of arms, there is the sign \"1408\" \u2013 the date of the first written mention of the city. On both sides of the coat of arms and all four corners of the field are filled with floral ornaments and with the addition of two beech branches with nuts and leaves. The reverse side is formed by a yellow background with the coat of arms of Ukraine in the center with frames and ornaments similar to the front side.\nHonorary chain of the mayor of Chernivtsi.\nThe mayor's honorary chain is a symbol of Chernivtsi mayor's authority, which is served on behalf of the territorial community. Founded in 1908 and restored in 2008.

This indicates a special attitude of the emperor to the city. Along with the capital of Bukovina, only the first naval ship of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"SMS%20Viribus%20Unitis\"&gt;SMS \"Viribus Unitis\"&lt;/a&gt;) was honoured with such honour.\nLogotype of Chernivtsi.\nThe official \"Chernivtsi 600\" logo was developed and approved by the anniversary of the city in 2008. It was recognized so successful that it continues to be used. The main idea of components for emblem is based on the antiquity of the city, its exceptional architectural heritage and the hard work of its inhabitants. The symbol is made in the form of a blacksmith's work of art, which testifies to the soundness, prosperity, and success. The color scheme of the logo, represented by dark blue and yellow, has a higher degree of comfortable contrast and coincides with the colors of the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;State Flag of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 2010s, a new city logo was developed and approved, and at the same time the official slogan was affixed: \"Chernivtsi is unique in diversity\". Old and new symbols of Chernivtsi were chosen for its creation. To the left, in the foreground, there is a trumpet player who wins the trumpet tune \"Marichka\". In the middle of the background, there is the town hall. The former &lt;a href=\"Residence%20of%20Bukovinian%20and%20Dalmatian%20Metropolitans\"&gt;Metropolitan Residence of Bukovina and Dalmatia&lt;/a&gt; which is recognized as the architectural pearl of the city is pictured to the right in the background.\nThe colour scheme of the logo represented in orange, blue and red, the name is purple. Such a combination is characteristic of tourism, which uses the notion of happiness, well-being, the joy of relaxation, visualizing positive symbols and images in a colourful, warm and vibrant colour scheme. The new logo uses old symbols from the \"Chernivtsi 600\" logo.\nGeography and climate.\nChernivtsi is located in the historic region of &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently shared between Romania (south) and Ukraine (north). Chernivtsi is located in the southwest of Ukraine, in the eastern Carpathians, on the border between the Carpathians and the East European Plain, 40\u00a0km from the border with Romania. The city lies 248 meters &lt;a href=\"above%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt; and is surrounded by forests and fields. The River &lt;a href=\"Prut\"&gt;Prut&lt;/a&gt; runs through the city's landscape. The city is located in the Eastern European time zone in the region of 26 meridians.\nChernivtsi is located at the intersection of the transport arteries: E85, H03, and H10\nClimate.\nThe city is located in a temperate climate zone. The climate is continental with mild winters and warm summers. The average annual temperature is +8,6\u00a0\u00b0C, the lowest in January (-2,9\u00a0\u00b0C), the highest \u2013 in July (+19,8\u00a0\u00b0C). Winter usually comes on 28 November and ends 9 March; summer begins on 20 May, and ends on 10 September. The average annual rainfall in Chernivtsi is 621\u00a0mm, with the lowest \u2013 in October and January\u2013February, the highest \u2013 in June\u2013July. Sometimes there are heavy rains during the summer. Snow cover is formed each winter, but its altitude is insignificant. The average wind speed ranges from 3.3\u00a0m/s in July to 4.0\u00a0m/s in January. The average annual humidity is 77%.\nLandscape.\nThe total area of Chernivtsi within the administrative boundaries of 2013 is about . According to the functional purpose the lands of the city are divided as follows: land of residential and public buildings (64%), lands of agricultural purpose (17%), lands of industry (9%), lands of recreational and environmental purpose (5%), lands of general use (3%), commercial land (2%).\nThe main water source of Chernivtsi is the &lt;a href=\"Prut%20river\"&gt;Prut River&lt;/a&gt; in its upper reaches, which divides the city in half. Besides, there are six small streams and nine lakes within the city.\nThe relief is characterized by significant relief dip \u2013 from 150 m above sea level in the Prut valleys to 537 m in the western outskirts (Mount &lt;a href=\"Tsetzino\"&gt;Tsetzino&lt;/a&gt;), which is caused by the location on the &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Upland\"&gt;Chernivtsi Upland&lt;/a&gt;.\nChernivtsi is considered to be a \"green city\": the large territory is occupied by parks, squares, gardens, alleys and flower gardens. Nine objects are recognized as monuments of landscape art. The city has a botanical garden at the Yuriy Fedkovych National University with a unique orangery. Among the relict plants growing in the botanical garden, a special place is occupied by a giant &lt;a href=\"Sequoiadendron\"&gt;Sequoiadendron&lt;/a&gt;.\nChernivtsi is located in the center of &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Regional%20Park\"&gt;Chernivtsi Regional Park&lt;/a&gt;, which borders zakaznik \"Thetzino\" in the west and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Berda\"&gt;Mount Berda&lt;/a&gt; in the north.\nState of the environment.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, the main pollutants of the Chernivtsi environment were industrial enterprises, including the MIC. In the 1990s much of them ceased to exist or significantly reduced production capacity and thus reduced industrial emissions. Despite this, 58 enterprises (38.4% of the total amount in the region) are the main pollutants of the environment. Approximately 1.2 tonnes of pollutants are released into the air annually (34.9% of the total area emissions). Non-methane volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and substances in the form of solid suspended solids predominate in the structure of the emitted pollutants. In addition, carbon dioxide, which has a &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20effect\"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;, is periodically released into the atmosphere of the city. Emissions from stationary sources were 7.9 tonnes per of Chernivtsi territory. Each inhabitant of the regional center accounts for an average of of harmful emissions per year.\nIn 2008, Chernivtsi established an Environmental Monitoring System (EMS), an information structure that integrates environmental monitoring organizations and industrial enterprises that pollute the environment or which may adversely affect the environment or its components.\nSince the late 1990s, transport is a significant factor in the negative impact on the environment. To some extent, the situation was improved with the construction of the first (2004) and the second (2010) queues of the &lt;a href=\"Bypass%20%28road%29\"&gt;bypass road&lt;/a&gt;, which connected the directions \"Kyiv-Chernivtsi\" and \"Chernivtsi-Suceava\". The problem of transit transport in the city will be finally resolved after the construction of the third branch of the bypass road, which will connect the directions \"Suceava-Chernivtsi\" and \"Chernivtsi-Lviv\".\nGovernment and subdivisions.\nChernivtsi is the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20center\"&gt;administrative center&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Chernivtsi%20Oblast\"&gt;Chernivtsi Oblast&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oblast\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;) and the city itself has own government within the oblast under direct subordination to oblast.\nThe territory of Chernivtsi is divided into three administrative city &lt;a href=\"raion\"&gt;raion&lt;/a&gt;s (districts):\nBetween 1994 and 2014 the mayor of Chernivtsi was Mykola Fedoruk.\nThe new mayor of Chernivtsi is Oleksiy Kaspruk, who has held the position since 2014.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the latest &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Census%20%282001%29\"&gt;All-Ukrainian population census&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, the population of Chernivtsi was approximately 240,600 people of 65 nationalities. Among them, 189,000 (79.8%) are Ukrainians; 26,700 (11.3%) &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;; 10,500 (4.4%) Romanians; 3,800 (1.6%) &lt;a href=\"Moldovans\"&gt;Moldovans&lt;/a&gt;; 1,400 (0.6%) &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;; 1,300 (0.6%) Jews; 2,900 (1.2%) other nationalities.\nBased on the last available Soviet data, the population of the city, as of 1 January 1989, was approximately 295,000 residents. Among these, there are some 172,000 Ukrainians, 46,000 Russians, 16,000 Romanians, 13,000 &lt;a href=\"Moldovans\"&gt;Moldovans&lt;/a&gt;, 7,000 Poles and others.\nThe Romanian population in Chernivtsi started decreasing rapidly after 1950. Many Romanians fled to Romania or were deported to &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt; (where most of them died), and the remaining Romanian population quickly became a minority and assimilated with the majority. Nowadays, the Romanian minority in Chernivtsi is still decreasing as a result of &lt;a href=\"cultural%20assimilation\"&gt;cultural assimilation&lt;/a&gt; and emigration to Romania.\nChernivtsi once had a Jewish community of over 50,000, less than a third of whom survived World War II. Romanian lawyer and reserve officer &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Criveanu\"&gt;Theodor Criveanu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the then city mayor &lt;a href=\"Traian%20Popovici\"&gt;Traian Popovici&lt;/a&gt;, supported by General &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Ionescu\"&gt;Vasile Ionescu&lt;/a&gt; saved 19,689 Jewish people. Initially, Governor of Bukovina &lt;a href=\"Corneliu%20Calotescu\"&gt;Corneliu Calotescu&lt;/a&gt; allowed only 190 Jewish people to stay, but Traian Popovici, after an incredible effort, obtained from the then dictator of Romania Marshal &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Antonescu\"&gt;Ion Antonescu&lt;/a&gt; an allowance of 20,000. After World War II, the city was a key node in the &lt;a href=\"Berihah\"&gt;Berihah&lt;/a&gt; network, which helped Jews to emigrate to the then &lt;a href=\"Mandate%20Palestine\"&gt;Mandate Palestine&lt;/a&gt; from the difficult conditions after the War. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and the United States. A famous member of this latter emigration is the actress &lt;a href=\"Mila%20Kunis\"&gt;Mila Kunis&lt;/a&gt;.\nChernivtsi was inhabited by Ukrainians, Romanians, Poles, &lt;a href=\"Ruthenians\"&gt;Ruthenians&lt;/a&gt;, Jews, &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people\"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;. During its affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; monarchy, Chernivtsi enjoyed prosperity and culture as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crown%20land%23Austria\"&gt;crown land&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1918, the main language of the city was German, which, in addition to the Germans, was also spoken by Jews (together they made up half the population of the city) and even partly by Ukrainians, Romanians and Poles. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shoah\"&gt;Shoah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porajmos\"&gt;Porajmos&lt;/a&gt;, and the resettlement and expulsion of the whole ethnic groups, including Germans and Romanians, this status was diminished. Today, the Ukrainians are the dominant population group.\nChernivtsi's change in demographic diversity is demonstrated by the following population statistics. Once, Romanians and Ukrainians formed the majority of the population. However, after 1870, &lt;a href=\"Yiddish%20language\"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;-speaking or &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-speaking Jews surpassed the Romanians as the largest population group of the town.
