    "text": "Nike Tiempo is a &lt;a href=\"sportswear\"&gt;sportswear&lt;/a&gt; line designed by &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; and targeted at &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; players. The range includes mainly &lt;a href=\"football%20boot\"&gt;football boot&lt;/a&gt;s, but has also included &lt;a href=\"Kit%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;uniforms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shin%20guard\"&gt;shin guard&lt;/a&gt;s under the same label.\nHistory.\nNike boots sporting the &lt;a href=\"Swoosh\"&gt;Swoosh&lt;/a&gt; logo, exclusive to the brand, were seen during the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Nike supplied boots to ten of the players in the final between &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. The two were, at the time, among the most successful teams in the world. Sponsorship agreements were reached with Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Romario\"&gt;Romario&lt;/a&gt; and Italian &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Maldini\"&gt;Paolo Maldini&lt;/a&gt; for the use of Nike Tiempo boots. Such attention broke the dominance of &lt;a href=\"Hummel%20International\"&gt;Hummel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Puma%20AG\"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, who were the favoured brands for international football players. Later that year, the first Nike cleats became commercially available to the public.\nThe Nike Tiempo football boot is known for its comfort. It is endorsed by players including &lt;a href=\"Ronaldinho\"&gt;Ronaldinho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Ramos\"&gt;Sergio Ramos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Puyol\"&gt;Carlos Puyol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Piqu%C3%A9\"&gt;Gerard Piqu\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Boateng\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Pirlo\"&gt;Andrea Pirlo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Sung%20Park\"&gt;Ji Sung Park&lt;/a&gt;, Ido Bleicher and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Tevez\"&gt;Carlos Tevez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julie%20Ertz\"&gt;Julie Ertz&lt;/a&gt;. \nMost Nike Tiempo boots are available in different versions, ranging in price from $99 to $240. The boot comes in plain and original colors, and can be personalised through the use of &lt;a href=\"NIKEiD\"&gt;NIKEiD&lt;/a&gt;. It comes in four different soles: FG (firm ground), SG (soft ground), AG (&lt;a href=\"Artificial%20turf\"&gt;artificial grass&lt;/a&gt;) and IC (indoor).\nThe Nike Tiempos also come in Elite versions. Similar to other cleats in the Elite series (&lt;a href=\"Nike%20Total%2090\"&gt;T90&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nike%20CTR360%20Maestri\"&gt;CTR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nike%20Mercurial%20Vapor%23Mercurial%20Vapor%20V%20.26%20Mercurial%20Vapor%20Superfly\"&gt;SUPERFLY&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"chassis\"&gt;chassis&lt;/a&gt; of the Legend Elite is made of &lt;a href=\"Carbon-fibre-reinforced%20polymer\"&gt;carbon fiber&lt;/a&gt; to reduce weight. The Elite version of the Legend III instead uses a new material called Kanga-Lite. Kanga-Lite is a &lt;a href=\"Waterproofing\"&gt;water-resistant&lt;/a&gt; synthetic material that mimics the feel and touch of &lt;a href=\"kangaroo%20leather\"&gt;kangaroo leather&lt;/a&gt; while maintaining its performance in all conditions. The first Elite version was released in Metallic Mach/Purple/Total Orange exclusively for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubsequently the Tiempo has been released under the 10R (Ronaldinho). Ronaldinho has his own version called Ronaldinho Dois.\nOn 1 July 2010, The Nike Tiempo Legend III was released in two colorways: Black/White/Volt and Metallic White/Chilling Red. Subsequent colorways include White/Seaweed/Sport Red, Pearl/Black/Team Orange, White/Black/Del Sol, Black/White/Gold and Metallic Mach/Purple/Total Orange (only available in the Elite versions of the Nike Tiempo).\nThe launch of the Tiempo Legend IV on 1 July 2011 marked a change in Nike's management of the Tiempo line, introducing an 'Elite' level boot at the time of launch (rather than partway through the boot's lifespan, as with the Legend III).\nWhilst the Tiempo Legend IV received several notable updates, including a synthetic 'KangaLite' Leather midfoot and heel to improve stability and the removal of the classic Tiempo tongue, Nike's marketing surrounding the line focused on the Tiempo Legend IV Elite. Featuring Flywire similar to that on the Superfly III, full &lt;a href=\"Carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer\"&gt;Carbon Fibre&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"chassis\"&gt;chassis&lt;/a&gt; and 'Premium' kangaroo leather, the Tiempo Legend IV Elite was Nike's lead boot for the &lt;a href=\"autumn\"&gt;autumn&lt;/a&gt; of 2011.\nLaunching in Black/White/Total Orange, the Tiempo Legend IV Elite was the most expensive Tiempo ever, costing &lt;a href=\"Pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;275 (over &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;315).\nThe Nike Tiempo Legend V was launched in December 2013 in Desert Sand/Atomic Orange/Black. This updated version of the Tiempo is 0.8 ounces lighter than its predecessor. Nike's ACC (All Conditions Control) and Hypershield technologies are designed to reduce water uptake, a common problem with natural leather boots.\nThe Nike Tiempo Legend VI had a more seamless feel, and super-soft leather.\nThe Nike Tiempo Legend VII was the first version to include Flyknit. The result is a boot with enhanced fit and comfort that is 22% lighter than its predecessor. To help prevent overstretching of the leather &lt;a href=\"toe%20box\"&gt;toe box&lt;/a&gt;, Nike developed Fit-Mesh, which made its debut in the Tiempo Legend VII. also the legend 8 has an upper similar to the magistas only little bit better in almost everything though.\nSpecial editions.\nIn 2015, special edition Nike Tiempos were released to commemorate the careers of Ronaldinho and Francesco Totti. They became the most expensive Tiempos in history, costing \u20ac300. They were individually numbered and only 3,000 of each were made.\nShin guards.\nNike Tiempo shin guards are made out of &lt;a href=\"polypropylene\"&gt;polypropylene&lt;/a&gt; shell for comfortable and durable protection. They have straps for a secure and adjustable fit."
