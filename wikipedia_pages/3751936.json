    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;, a \"proposition bet\" (prop bet, prop, novelty, or a side bet) is a bet made regarding the occurrence or non-occurrence during a game (usually a gambling game) of an event not directly affecting the game's final outcome.\nProposition bets in sports are differentiated from the general bets for or against a particular team or regarding the total number of points scored. Traditionally, proposition bets can be made on outcomes such as the number of strikeouts a &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; will accumulate in a &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; game, whether a non-&lt;a href=\"American%20football%20positions%23Offense\"&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; player will score in an &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; game, which team will score the first points of the game, the discipline record of teams in a match, the timing of certain events, the number of specific events per team or in the entire match, realistically any statistically discrete event contained in a match or game could be bet on.\nFixing part of a match for a certain result in a proposition bet is called &lt;a href=\"spot-fixing\"&gt;spot-fixing&lt;/a&gt;.\nExamples.\nThere are a wide range of events or outcomes commonly bet on, including:\nSome jurisdictions do not allow casinos to offer any type of non-sport related proposition bets, but these kinds of prop bets can often be found online.\nDare for money.\nLess commonly, \"proposition bet\" (in this context also \"one-of-a-kind bet\") denotes a dare for money. The bet is on whether the \"dared\" person will make a given event happen. If the \"dared\" person accepts the bet, they will collect if they succeed or pay if they fail.\nFor an example detailed in the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Professor%2C%20the%20Banker%2C%20and%20the%20Suicide%20King\"&gt;The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"David%20Grey\"&gt;David Grey&lt;/a&gt; once bet &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Lederer\"&gt;Howard Lederer&lt;/a&gt;, a professional poker player who became &lt;a href=\"vegetarian\"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"gastric%20bypass%20surgery\"&gt;gastric bypass surgery&lt;/a&gt;, $10,000 that Lederer would not eat an offered &lt;a href=\"cheeseburger\"&gt;cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt;. Lederer accepted the wager, ate the cheeseburger, and won the bet.\nSpot fixing.\n&lt;a href=\"Spot-fixing\"&gt;Spot-fixing&lt;/a&gt; is an illegal activity where a person involved in the game takes steps to ensure a certain result for a proposition bet. Instead of fixing an entire match, or shaving points, spot fixing can be done with as little as one player, and can involve ensuring a certain outcome on only a single play, and may be completely unrelated to the points/results in a game.\nExamples include &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Le%20Tissier\"&gt;Matt Le Tissier&lt;/a&gt; attempting to fix the time of a &lt;a href=\"throw-in\"&gt;throw-in&lt;/a&gt; by kicking it out immediately after the game started, or &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Tandy\"&gt;Ryan Tandy&lt;/a&gt; attempting to fix the first &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league%20gameplay%23Point_scoring\"&gt;point scored method&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; game, failing after the opposition decided against kicking a penalty goal and instead scored a try. Multiple &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; players on teams at all levels of the sport have also attempted to fix events, such as the number of &lt;a href=\"wide%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;wides&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"no-ball\"&gt;no-ball&lt;/a&gt;s in an over or the number of runs scored.\nThe fact that these minor events often contribute a minor or non-existent impact on the score or result of a game makes recruiting players for spot fixing an easier attraction than attempting to fix an entire match that may consist of dozens of players."
