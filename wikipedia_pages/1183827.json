    "text": "The Nakdong River or Nakdonggang () is the longest &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and passes through major cities such as &lt;a href=\"Daegu\"&gt;Daegu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;. It takes its name from its role as the eastern border of the &lt;a href=\"Gaya%20confederacy\"&gt;Gaya confederacy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Korea's Three Kingdoms Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Nakdong flows from the &lt;a href=\"Taebaek%20Mountains\"&gt;Taebaek Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the South Sea or Korean Strait, which separates Korea from Japan. The river originates from the junction of the Cheolamcheon and Hwangjicheon streams in Dongjeom-dong, &lt;a href=\"Taebaek\"&gt;Taebaek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gangwon-do%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Gangwon&lt;/a&gt; province. From there to its mouth it winds for about . The width of the river ranges from only a few metres in its upper reaches, to several hundred metres towards its estuary.\nMajor tributaries include the &lt;a href=\"Yeong%20River\"&gt;Yeong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geumho%20River\"&gt;Geumho&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nam%20River%20%28Korea%29\"&gt;Nam&lt;/a&gt; rivers. Together with its tributaries, the Nakdong drains most of &lt;a href=\"North%20Gyeongsang\"&gt;North Gyeongsang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Gyeongsang\"&gt;South Gyeongsang&lt;/a&gt; provinces, along with small portions of &lt;a href=\"North%20Jeolla\"&gt;North Jeolla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Jeolla\"&gt;South Jeolla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gangwon-do%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Gangwon&lt;/a&gt;. The total &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; is .\nHistory.\nThe Nakdong River has played an important role throughout &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Korean history&lt;/a&gt;. The river basin has been a favored dwelling-place for as long as people have inhabited the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20peninsula\"&gt;Korean peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; remains have been found in the valley.\nAround the 1st century, the valley is believed to have been inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Byeonhan%20confederacy\"&gt;Byeonhan confederacy&lt;/a&gt; tribes. During the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Three Kingdoms period&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gaya%20confederacy\"&gt;Gaya confederacy&lt;/a&gt; controlled the valley, until they were overrun by &lt;a href=\"Silla\"&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; in 562. These states exploited the river's potential for navigation and commerce, operating a thriving trade in &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s with neighboring countries, including &lt;a href=\"Yamato%20period\"&gt;Yamato period&lt;/a&gt; Japan. Through the Silla, &lt;a href=\"Goryeo\"&gt;Goryeo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20Dynasty\"&gt;Joseon&lt;/a&gt; periods, the river continued to serve as a major transportation corridor in the &lt;a href=\"Gyeongsang\"&gt;Gyeongsang&lt;/a&gt; region. It was especially used for transporting fresh seafood inland, such as &lt;a href=\"mackerel\"&gt;mackerel&lt;/a&gt;, which were salted and dried in order to prevent them from spoiling. The city of &lt;a href=\"Andong\"&gt;Andong&lt;/a&gt; was the farthest inland the fish could be brought before going bad, so many people flocked there during the Joseon Dynasty to eat fish.\nAs a barrier to movement, the Nakdong River gained sudden prominence during the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;. The southern length of the river formed the western portion of the &lt;a href=\"Pusan%20Perimeter\"&gt;Pusan Perimeter&lt;/a&gt;, which the UN forces fought to maintain during the autumn of 1950. The bridge over the Nakdong River at &lt;a href=\"Waegwan\"&gt;Waegwan&lt;/a&gt; was blown up on August 3, 1950 in an effort to prevent &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n forces from advancing on &lt;a href=\"Daegu\"&gt;Daegu&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of South Korean &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s were killed in the explosion. Although some North Korean forces did cross the Nakdong River in places, for the most part the river still marks their furthest advance.\nNakdong river phenol contamination incident.\nIn 1991, there were two incidents where &lt;a href=\"phenol\"&gt;phenol&lt;/a&gt; was leaked into the river from &lt;a href=\"Doosan\"&gt;Doosan&lt;/a&gt; Electronics. There were two leaks, the first thirty tons on March 14, 1991 and the second 1.3 tons on April 22. The phenol ended up at a water processing facility used for drinking water in &lt;a href=\"Daegu\"&gt;Daegu&lt;/a&gt; and began to smell after becoming &lt;a href=\"chlorophenol\"&gt;chlorophenol&lt;/a&gt; when the water was sanitized with &lt;a href=\"chlorine\"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt;.\nEcology.\nThe Nakdong valley includes numerous floodplain wetlands, the most well-known of which are the Joonam Reservoirs near Changwon City and Upo Ramsar site, in &lt;a href=\"Changnyeong%20County\"&gt;Changnyeong County&lt;/a&gt;, South Gyeongsang. These wetlands, while significantly degraded and overdeveloped, still provide habitat to a significant number of rare and threatened species, most especially birds (such as the Baikal Teal, \"Anas formosa\", and White-naped Crane, \"Grus vipio\"), fish and plants. Despite being home to the bustling Port of &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, the Nakdong &lt;a href=\"Estuary\"&gt;Estuary&lt;/a&gt; is also internationally important for waterbirds, despite recent ecologically-destructive developments including reclamation for housing and industry (e.g. the Busan New Port), the ongoing construction of a major bridge (the Miyeonji Bridge) and most recently the threatened construction of the Korean Grand Canal project.\nThe Nakdong and its tributaries also serve as a major source of &lt;a href=\"drinking%20water\"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; for the inhabitants of the river basin and others nearby. However, &lt;a href=\"water%20pollution\"&gt;water pollution&lt;/a&gt; due to domestic and &lt;a href=\"agricultural%20wastewater\"&gt;agricultural wastewater&lt;/a&gt; remains a serious concern.\nEconomic role.\nAlthough all but the southernmost reaches of the Nakdong River have ceased to serve as a major commercial waterway, the river continues to feed those dwelling near it, both directly through &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; and indirectly through &lt;a href=\"irrigation\"&gt;irrigation&lt;/a&gt;. Substantial amounts of &lt;a href=\"snails\"&gt;snails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"catfish\"&gt;catfish&lt;/a&gt; are taken from the waters and used in local cuisine.\nNear &lt;a href=\"Andong\"&gt;Andong&lt;/a&gt;, a series of massive hydroelectric dams have been constructed, creating a small chain of artificial lakes of which &lt;a href=\"Andong%20Lake\"&gt;Andong Lake&lt;/a&gt; is the largest. These lakes also support a substantial &lt;a href=\"recreation\"&gt;recreation&lt;/a&gt;al industry. &lt;a href=\"Bass%20fishing\"&gt;Bass fishing&lt;/a&gt; is especially popular, since the lakes have been artificially stocked with &lt;a href=\"bass%20%28fish%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 2010s, the Nakdong River was to be part of former Korean president &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Myung%20Bak\"&gt;Lee Myung Bak&lt;/a&gt;'s canal project, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Korean%20Waterway\"&gt;Grand Korean Waterway&lt;/a&gt;. The project would link the Nakdong with the Han River to the north, creating a shipping canal spanning length of the country, from Seoul to Busan. Encountering considerable controversy nationwide as well as from residents along the Nakdong, the Waterway project was scrapped by the end of Lee's presidency.\nFestival.\nNakdong River Bicycle Festival - The Nakdong River Cultural Center hold bicycle festivals that everyone can enjoy the healthy leisure culture of local residents. It is composed of flat courses about 20Km in the vicinity of Eulsukdo and Nakdong River Cultural Center."
