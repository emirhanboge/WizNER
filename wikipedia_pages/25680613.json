    "text": "The Battle of Dover Strait that occurred on 26\u201327 October 1916 was a &lt;a href=\"naval%20battle\"&gt;naval battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Two and a half &lt;a href=\"flotilla\"&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt;s of German &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Flanders%20Flotilla\"&gt;Flanders Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; launched a raid into the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Strait\"&gt;Dover Strait&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to disrupt the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Barrage\"&gt;Dover Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and destroy whatever &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; shipping could be found in the strait.\nUpon approaching the barrage, the German torpedo boats were challenged by the British &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and an engagement broke out. The Germans were able to destroy \"Flirt\" and successfully assault the barrage's &lt;a href=\"Naval%20drifter\"&gt;drifters&lt;/a&gt;, but were once more engaged when a flotilla of British destroyers was sent to repel them. The Germans were able to fight off the additional British units before successfully withdrawing. By the end of the night, the British had lost one destroyer, a &lt;a href=\"Transport%20%28ship%29\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt;, and several drifters while the Germans themselves suffered only minor damage to a single torpedo boat.\nBackground.\nIn October 1916, the Flanders Flotilla was finally reinforced by the German Admiralty with two full &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flotilla\"&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt;s. The transfer of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Torpedo%20Boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;3rd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Torpedo%20Boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; had immediate consequences to the balance of power in the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Strait\"&gt;Dover Strait&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats and several of the smaller inferior s, they now possessed 23\u00a0large torpedo boats capable of meeting the British &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Patrol\"&gt;Dover Patrol&lt;/a&gt; in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.\nWith his newly acquired flotillas, the Flanders Flotilla's commander - Admiral &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Schr%C3%B6der\"&gt;Ludwig von Schr\u00f6der&lt;/a&gt; - decided to launch a raid in the Dover Strait against the &lt;a href=\"Dover%20Barrage\"&gt;Dover Barrage&lt;/a&gt; as well as any &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; shipping that could be found in &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;the Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Although the British had prohibited &lt;a href=\"Transport%20%28ship%29\"&gt;transports&lt;/a&gt; from being in the Channel at night in anticipation of a German raid, the Dover Barrage was not prepared to meet such an attack. Facing Schr\u00f6der's 23 boats, the Dover Barrage was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht \"Ombra\", and the &lt;a href=\"naval%20trawler\"&gt;naval trawler&lt;/a&gt; \"H. E. Straud\". The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage's &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20net\"&gt;anti-submarine net&lt;/a&gt;s were armed with only a single rifle each for defence. In addition to the forces guarding the Barrage, there were six s at Dover that could be called upon in the event of a raid as well as several units of &lt;a href=\"Harwich%20Force\"&gt;Harwich Force&lt;/a&gt; dispersed at &lt;a href=\"The%20Downs%20%28ship%20anchorage%29\"&gt;the Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle.\nThe German torpedo boats split into five groups, with each attacking a different section of the shipping in the channel. The German 5th Half-Flotilla sailed into the Dover Barrage and soon came into contact with five drifters of the 10th Drifter Division tending the anti-submarine nets and attacked. After hearing gunfire, \"Flirt\"\u2014the drifters' escort\u2014approached the unidentified vessels and challenged them. The boats responded to the British signal with a similar signal. Confused, \"Flirt\"s commander decided that the approaching vessels were Allied destroyers and that drifters had been attacked by a &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;. An open boat was also launched from \"Flirt\" to rescue survivors from the sinking drifters. The German boats attacked the destroyer, surprising the crew. Outnumbered, \"Flirt\" tried to ram one of the German boats; after a brief engagement it was sunk by gunfire and &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. After sinking \"Flirt\", the Germans continued the attack on the barrage, sinking two drifters each from the 8th and 16th Drifter Divisions. Six drifters were sunk and three others damaged, as well as the trawler \"H. E. Straud\", before the Fifth Half-Flotilla withdrew.\nWhen Admiral &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Bacon\"&gt;Reginald Bacon&lt;/a&gt; - the commander of the Dover Patrol - heard about the raid, he sent six Tribal-class destroyers\u2014, , , , and \u2014to engage the Germans. Due to a misinterpretation of his orders, the British commander of the destroyer division\u2014Commander Henry Oliphant of \"Viking\"\u2014deployed his destroyers in two loose groups, one consisting of \"Viking\", \"Mohawk\", and \"Tartar\" and the other \"Nubian\", \"Amazon\" and \"Cossack\". \"Nubian\" soon steamed far ahead of her group and was the first vessel to reach the scene of \"Flirt\"s sinking. Another half-flotilla of German boats had caught the empty British transport \"Queen\" off &lt;a href=\"Goodwin%20Sands\"&gt;Goodwin Sands&lt;/a&gt; as it returned from the French coast, boarded it and removed her crew before sinking her.\nUpon \"Nubian\"s contact with the German &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Half-Flotilla\"&gt;17th Half Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;, she made the same error as \"Flirt\" and mistook the German boats for Allied vessels. Surprised with a hail of gunfire, \"Nubian\" attempted to ram the last boat in the German &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20battle\"&gt;line of battle&lt;/a&gt; but was struck by a torpedo that blew off her &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and reduced her to a drifting hulk. \"Amazon\" and \"Cossack\" soon arrived to aid \"Nubian\" and engaged the German boats. The Germans scored several hits on \"Amazon\", knocking out two of her boilers before withdrawing. \"Viking\"s division of boats also clashed with \"&lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Marine\"&gt;Kaiserliche Marine&lt;/a&gt;\" torpedo boats. The German &lt;a href=\"Eighteenth%20Half-Flotilla\"&gt;18th Half Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; was heading back to &lt;a href=\"Zeebrugge\"&gt;Zeebrugge&lt;/a&gt; when it sailed into Oliphant's group of destroyers, engaging them as they passed. Although \"Viking\" escaped unscathed, \"Mohawk\" suffered several hits, before the Germans were able to break away to the safety of the coast. Near the end of the action, Admiral Bacon dispatched the Dunkirk Division to intercept the German torpedo boats before they could return to Flanders but the Germans were able to successfully withdraw before being caught by these further reinforcements.\nAftermath.\nThe British had failed to stop the raiders from destroying the drifters and 45\u00a0men were killed, four wounded and 10\u00a0taken prisoner. Six ships were sunk in addition to \"Flirt\", the transport \"Queen\" and three destroyers, three drifters and a naval trawler were damaged. Of the German torpedo boats, only suffered any damage and no German vessel suffered any casualties. The success of the raid encouraged the Germans to plan more sorties into the English Channel and the raids continued until the 3rd and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas were redeployed to the &lt;a href=\"German%20High%20Seas%20Fleet\"&gt;High Seas Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in November 1916."
