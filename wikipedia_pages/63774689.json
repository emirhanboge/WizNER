    "text": "Scantrust is a Swiss company that provides an &lt;a href=\"Internet%20of%20things\"&gt;Internet of things&lt;/a&gt; platform for identifying products on the internet.\nScantrust offers traceability for various industries, such as luxury goods, food products, industrial machines, water filters, cables, agrochemical products and fiscal stamps. Nathan J. Anderson is the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Justin%20Picard\"&gt;Justin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, Nathan J. Anderson, and Paul Landry founded Scantrust at the end of 2013. A seed round led by &lt;a href=\"SOSV\"&gt;SOSV&lt;/a&gt; was raised in 2015, and a series A led by &lt;a href=\"Credit%20Suisse\"&gt;Credit Suisse&lt;/a&gt; was raised in 2017. In 2016,\u00a0the company concluded a partnership with &lt;a href=\"Agfa-Gevaert\"&gt;Agfa-Gevaert&lt;/a&gt; to integrate its technologies into Agfa's security software. In 2017 the &lt;a href=\"National%20Seeds%20Institute%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;National Seeds Institute of Argentina&lt;/a&gt; released a fiscal stamp printed with Scantrust secure QR Code. In 2018 the company entered into a partnership with &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger\"&gt;Hyperledger&lt;/a&gt; and began offering services using &lt;a href=\"Hyperledger%20Sawtooth\"&gt;Hyperledger Sawtooth&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, the Dutch Standards organisation NEN announced they would use Scantrust secure QR codes to ensure the authenticity of their certificates. The same year, Scantrust entered into a partnership with &lt;a href=\"HP%20Indigo%20Division\"&gt;HP Indigo&lt;/a&gt; for labels printed with HP commercial printers. In 2020, Scantrust entered into a partnership with &lt;a href=\"SAP%20SE\"&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt; to deliver end-to-end traceability.\nProduct authentication and traceability.\nThe company has developed a &lt;a href=\"QR%20code\"&gt;QR Code&lt;/a&gt; system with an additional layer of protection against copying, based on inserting a &lt;a href=\"copy%20detection%20pattern\"&gt;copy detection pattern&lt;/a&gt; or secure graphic which loses information when it is copied. The technology does not require special materials, inks, and modifications to printing equipment to implement. Related product authentication and traceability data can be stored into a blockchain.\nQR Codes used in Scantrust authentication and traceability systems are printed on product packaging and scanned with a smartphone to authenticate and track products. The company provides a free app to consumers which can be used to scan products with the copy detection pattern and help detect counterfeits. Scanning of a code with a smartphone can also offer a traceability feature with origin and supply chain information made about the product made available An enterprise app is also provided for employees, distributors and forensic inspections."
