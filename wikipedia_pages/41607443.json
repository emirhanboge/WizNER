    "text": "The Phoenix Hotel building at 180 Main Street is the most prominent and distinctive building in downtown &lt;a href=\"Rison%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Rison, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. It is a two-story brick building that was built in 1913 by Dr. T. H. Ackerman to replace a previous hotel building on the site. The most distinctive feature of its facade is a basket-handled arch that frames the recessed porch on the second floor. The roof line is more elaborate than that of other downtown buildings, with &lt;a href=\"corbel\"&gt;corbel&lt;/a&gt;s and brick &lt;a href=\"quoin\"&gt;quoin&lt;/a&gt;s decorating the roof edge. The hotel went through a modest number of owners before closing its doors in the 1960s.\nThe building was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. The Phoenix Hotel was demolished July 2014. It now is the location of Gateway Bank formerly known as the Bank of Rison."
