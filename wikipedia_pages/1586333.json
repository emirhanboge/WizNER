    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, a bond option is an &lt;a href=\"option%20%28finance%29\"&gt;option&lt;/a&gt; to buy or sell a &lt;a href=\"bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bond&lt;/a&gt; at a certain price on or before the option expiry date. These instruments are typically traded &lt;a href=\"Over-the-counter%20%28finance%29\"&gt;OTC&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerally, one buys a &lt;a href=\"call%20option\"&gt;call option&lt;/a&gt; on the bond if one believes that &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate\"&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt;s will fall, causing an increase in bond prices. Likewise, one buys the &lt;a href=\"put%20option\"&gt;put option&lt;/a&gt; if one believes that interest rates will rise. One result of trading in a bond option, is that the price of the underlying bond is \"locked in\" for the term of the contract, thereby reducing the &lt;a href=\"credit%20risk\"&gt;credit risk&lt;/a&gt; associated with fluctuations in the bond price.\nValuation.\n&lt;a href=\"bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"underlying\"&gt;underlyers&lt;/a&gt; in this case, exhibit what is known as &lt;a href=\"pull%20to%20par\"&gt;pull-to-par&lt;/a&gt;: as the bond reaches its maturity date, all of the prices involved with the bond become known, thereby decreasing its &lt;a href=\"volatility%20%28finance%29\"&gt;volatility&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Scholes\"&gt;Black\u2013Scholes&lt;/a&gt; model, which assumes constant volatility, does not reflect this &lt;a href=\"Stochastic%20process\"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot therefore be applied here; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//kalotay.com/sites/default/files/private/BlackScholes.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; see &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Scholes%20model%23Valuing%20bond%20options\"&gt;Black\u2013Scholes model #Valuing bond options&lt;/a&gt;.\nAddressing this, bond options are usually valued using the &lt;a href=\"Black%20model\"&gt;Black model&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href=\"Lattice%20model%20%28finance%29\"&gt;lattice-based&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"short-rate%20model\"&gt;short-rate model&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Derman%E2%80%93Toy%20model\"&gt;Black-Derman-Toy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ho%E2%80%93Lee%20model\"&gt;Ho-Lee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hull%E2%80%93White%20model\"&gt;Hull\u2013White&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eelton/debt_inst_class/option%2520valuation.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The latter approach is theoretically more correct, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DwF8yVzLI6EYC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DValuation%2Bof%2Bfixed%2Bincome%2Bsecurities%2Band%2Bderivatives\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although in practice the Black Model is more widely used for reasons of simplicity and speed. For &lt;a href=\"American%20option\"&gt;American-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bermudan%20option\"&gt;Bermudan-&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"option%20style\"&gt;styled options&lt;/a&gt;, where exercise is permitted prior to maturity, only the lattice-based approach is applicable.\nEmbedded options.\nThe term \"bond option\" is also used for option-like features of some bonds (\"&lt;a href=\"embedded%20option\"&gt;embedded option&lt;/a&gt;s\"). These are an inherent part of the bond, rather than a separately traded product. These options are not mutually exclusive, so a bond may have several options embedded. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embedded%2Boption\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bonds of this type include:\nCallable and putable bonds can be valued using the lattice-based approach, as above, but additionally allowing that the effect of the embedded option is incorporated at each node in the tree, impacting the bond price and / or the option price as specified. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DwF8yVzLI6EYC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DValuation%2Bof%2Bfixed%2Bincome%2Bsecurities%2Band%2Bderivatives\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These bonds are also sometimes valued using &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Scholes\"&gt;Black\u2013Scholes&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the bond is &lt;a href=\"Bond%20valuation\"&gt;priced as a \"straight bond\"&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. as if it had no embedded features) and the option is valued using the &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Scholes%23Black.E2.80.93Scholes%20formula\"&gt;Black Scholes formula&lt;/a&gt;. The option value is then added to the straight bond price if the optionality rests with the buyer of the bond; it is subtracted if the seller of the bond (i.e. the issuer) may choose to exercise. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-414-financial-management-summer-2003/lecture-notes/lec20_options2.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20110304203828/http%3A//www.numa.com/derivs/ref/calculat/cb/calc-cbb.htm\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/inv2ed/ill33p6.xls\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For convertible and exchangeable bonds, a more sophisticated approach is to model the instrument as a \"coupled system\" comprising an equity component and a debt component, each with different default risks; see &lt;a href=\"Lattice%20model%20%28finance%29%23Hybrid%20securities\"&gt;Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid securities&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelationship with caps and floors.\nEuropean Put options on zero coupon bonds can be seen to be equivalent to suitable caplets, i.e. &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate%20cap\"&gt;interest rate cap&lt;/a&gt; components, whereas call options can be seen to be equivalent to suitable floorlets, i.e. components of &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate%20floor\"&gt;interest rate floor&lt;/a&gt;s. See for example Brigo and Mercurio (2001), who also discuss bond options valuation with different models.\nExternal links.\nOnline tools"
