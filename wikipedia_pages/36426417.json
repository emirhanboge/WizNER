In 2000, he was promoted to referee matches in the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Super%20League\"&gt;Swiss Super League&lt;/a&gt;, and five years later he became a &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;-listed international official.\nHis first &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; appointment was a third round match between &lt;a href=\"NK%20Vara%C5%BEdin%20%281931%E2%80%932015%29\"&gt;Varteks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RC%20Lens\"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2005%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, he took charge of his first &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; match in the tournament proper (following two qualifying matches), a first round match between &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Slovan%20Liberec\"&gt;Slovan Liberec&lt;/a&gt;.

His most prestigious appointment was as fourth official in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2009 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt;, alongside referee &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Busacca\"&gt;Massimo Busacca&lt;/a&gt;.
