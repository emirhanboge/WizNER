    "text": "The cowboy hat is a high-crowned, wide-brimmed &lt;a href=\"hat\"&gt;hat&lt;/a&gt; best known as the defining piece of attire for the North American &lt;a href=\"cowboy\"&gt;cowboy&lt;/a&gt;. Today it is worn by many people, and is particularly associated with &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; workers in the western and southern &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"regional%20Mexican\"&gt;regional Mexican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BAsica%20sertaneja\"&gt;sertanejo&lt;/a&gt; music performers, and with participants in the North American &lt;a href=\"rodeo\"&gt;rodeo&lt;/a&gt; circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of &lt;a href=\"Old%20West\"&gt;Old West&lt;/a&gt; apparel.\nThe cowboy hat as known today has many antecedents to its design, including Mexican hats such as the &lt;a href=\"sombrero\"&gt;sombrero&lt;/a&gt;, the various designs of wide-brimmed hat worn by farmers and stockmen in the &lt;a href=\"eastern%20United%20States\"&gt;eastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the designs used by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Cavalry\"&gt;United States Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first western model was the open-crowned \"&lt;a href=\"Boss%20of%20the%20Plains\"&gt;Boss of the Plains&lt;/a&gt;\", and after that came the front-creased Carlsbad, destined to become \"the\" cowboy style. The high-crowned, wide-brimmed, soft-felt western hats that followed are intimately associated with the cowboy image.\nHistory.\nThe concept of a broad-brimmed hat with a high crown worn by a &lt;a href=\"equestrianism\"&gt;rider on horseback&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Mongolian horsemen&lt;/a&gt; of the 13th century. The hat has a tall crown that provides insulation, and a wide brim that provides shade. Hot and sunny climates inspire designs with very wide brims such as the &lt;a href=\"sombrero\"&gt;sombrero&lt;/a&gt; of Mexico.\nIt is not clear when the cowboy hat received its name. However, European-Americans in the Western United States originally had no standard headwear. People moving West wore many styles of hat, including &lt;a href=\"top%20hat\"&gt;top hat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bowler%20hat\"&gt;bowlers&lt;/a&gt;, remains of Civil War headgear, and &lt;a href=\"sailor%20hat\"&gt;sailor hat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nContrary to popular belief, it was the bowler and not the cowboy hat that was the most popular in the American West, prompting &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Beebe\"&gt;Lucius Beebe&lt;/a&gt; to call it \"the hat that won the West\". The working cowboy wore wide-brimmed and high-crowned hats. The hats were most likely adopted from the Mexican &lt;a href=\"Vaqueros\"&gt;Vaqueros&lt;/a&gt; before the invention of the modern design. &lt;a href=\"John%20Batterson%20Stetson\"&gt;John Batterson Stetson&lt;/a&gt; is credited for originating the modern day American Cowboy Hat.\nThe original \"&lt;a href=\"Boss%20of%20the%20Plains\"&gt;Boss of the Plains&lt;/a&gt;\", manufactured by Stetson in 1865, was flat-brimmed, had a straight sided crown, with rounded corners. These light-weight, waterproof hats were natural in color, with four-inch crowns and brims. A plain hatband was fitted to adjust head size. The sweatband bore &lt;a href=\"John%20B.%20Stetson\"&gt;Stetson&lt;/a&gt;'s name. While only making one style of hat, they came in different qualities ranging from one-grade material at five dollars apiece to pure &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt; felt hats for thirty dollars each. J.B. Stetson was the first to market the \"Boss of the Plains\" to cowboys, and it has remained the universal image of the American West. The charisma of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20West\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; was carried back East when adventurers returned in the expensive \"Boss of the plains\" style hat. In the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, a hat was an indispensable item in every man's wardrobe. Stetson focused on expensive, high-quality hats that represented a real investment for the working cowboy and a statement of success for the city dweller.\nThe durability and water-resistance of the original Stetson obtained additional publicity in 1912, when the battleship &lt;a href=\"USS%20Maine%20%28ACR-1%29\"&gt;USS \"Maine\"&lt;/a&gt; was raised from Havana harbor, where it had sunk in 1898. A Stetson hat was found in the wreck, which had been submerged in seawater for 14 years. The hat had been exposed to ooze, mud, and plant growth. However, the hat was cleaned off, and appeared to be undamaged.\nDesign.\nModern cowboy hats are made of fur-based &lt;a href=\"felt\"&gt;felt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; or, less often, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;. They are sold with a tall, rounded crown and a wide flat &lt;a href=\"brim%20%28hat%29\"&gt;brim&lt;/a&gt;. They have a simple sweat band on the inside to stabilize the fit of the head, and usually a small decorative hat band on the outside of the crown. Hats are customized by creasing the crown and rolling the brim. Often a more decorative hat band is added. In some places, \"stampede strings\" or \"wind strings\" are also attached. Hats can be manufactured in virtually any color, but are most often seen in shades of beige, brown and black. Beginning in the 1940s, &lt;a href=\"pastel\"&gt;pastel&lt;/a&gt; colors were introduced, seen often on hats worn by movie cowboys and rodeo riders. \"Today's cowboy hat has remained basically unchanged in construction and design since the first one was created in 1865 by &lt;a href=\"John%20B.%20Stetson%20Company\"&gt;J.B. Stetson&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nModern designs.\nThe modern cowboy hat has remained basically unchanged in &lt;a href=\"construction\"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; and underlying &lt;a href=\"design\"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; since the Stetson creation.\nThe cowboy hat quickly identified its wearer as someone associated with the West. \"Within a decade the name 'John B. Stetson' became synonymous with the word 'hat' in every corner and culture west of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;.\" The shape of the hat's crown and brim were often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; by being softened in hot steam, shaped, and allowed to dry and cool. Because of the ease of personalization, it was often possible to tell where a cowboy hat was from, right down to which &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;, simply by looking at the crease in the crown.\nLater as the mystique of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20West\"&gt;Wild West&lt;/a&gt; was popularized by entertainers such as &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Cody\"&gt;Buffalo Bill Cody&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western movies&lt;/a&gt; starring actors such as &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Mix\"&gt;Tom Mix&lt;/a&gt;, the Cowboy hat came to symbolize the &lt;a href=\"American%20West\"&gt;American West&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"John%20Wayne\"&gt;John Wayne&lt;/a&gt; christened them \"the hat that won the West\". The Boss of the Plains design influenced various wide-brimmed hats worn by &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;ers and &lt;a href=\"rancher\"&gt;rancher&lt;/a&gt;s all over the United States. Later designs were customized for law enforcement, military and motion pictures.\nThe first American law-enforcement agency to adopt Stetson's western hat as part of their uniform was the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. A Stetson-based design is also part of the ceremonial uniform of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police\"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariations.\nTen-gallon hats.\nSome cowboy hats have been called \"ten-gallon\" hats. The term came into use about 1925. There are multiple theories for how the concept arose.\nOne theory is that the term \"ten-gallon\" is a corruption of the Spanish modifier , which loosely translates as \"really handsome\" or \"so fine\". For example, \"\" translates as \"such a fine hat\".\nAnother theory is that the term \"ten-gallon\" is a corruption of the Spanish term , which means \"&lt;a href=\"galloon\"&gt;galloon&lt;/a&gt;\", a type of narrow braided trim around the crown, possibly a style adapted by &lt;a href=\"vaqueros\"&gt;Spanish cowboys&lt;/a&gt;. When Texas cowboys misunderstood the word for \"gallon\", the popular, though incorrect, legend may have been born. According to Reynolds and Rand, \"The term ten-gallon did not originally refer to the holding capacity of the hat, but to the width of a Mexican &lt;a href=\"sombrero\"&gt;sombrero&lt;/a&gt; hatband, and is more closely related to this unit of measurement by the Spanish than to the water-holding capacity of a Stetson.\"\nThe Stetson hat company boasted that the tight weave of most Stetsons hats made them sufficiently &lt;a href=\"waterproof\"&gt;waterproof&lt;/a&gt; to be used as a bucket. Early print advertising by Stetson showed a cowboy giving his horse a drink of water from a hat. The Stetson company notes that a \"ten-gallon\" hat holds only 3 quarts, not even one gallon (about 3\u00a0L instead of ).\nCalgary White Hat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20White%20Hat\"&gt;Calgary White Hat&lt;/a&gt; is a white felt cowboy hat which is the symbol of both the &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20Stampede\"&gt;Calgary Stampede&lt;/a&gt; annual rodeo and the city of &lt;a href=\"Calgary\"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;. Created by Morris Shumiatcher, owner of Smithbilt Hat Company, it was worn for the first time at the 1946 Stampede. In the early 1950s, Mayor of Calgary &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Hugh%20Mackay\"&gt;Donald Hugh Mackay&lt;/a&gt; began presenting the white hat to visiting dignitaries, a tradition that the mayor's office continues to this day. Thousands of tourists and groups also participate in \"white hatting ceremonies\" conducted by Tourism Calgary and by volunteer greeters at the &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Calgary International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. In 1983, the Calgary White Hat was incorporated into the design of the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Calgary\"&gt;flag of Calgary&lt;/a&gt;."
