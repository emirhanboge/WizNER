    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, a conjugated system is a system of connected &lt;a href=\"p-orbital\"&gt;p orbital&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"delocalized%20electron\"&gt;delocalized electron&lt;/a&gt;s in a molecule, which in general lowers the overall energy of the molecule and increases stability. It is &lt;a href=\"Resonance%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;conventionally represented&lt;/a&gt; as having alternating single and multiple &lt;a href=\"covalent%20bond\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lone%20pair\"&gt;Lone pair&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"radical%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;radicals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"carbenium%20ion\"&gt;carbenium ion&lt;/a&gt;s may be part of the system, which may be &lt;a href=\"Cyclic%20molecule\"&gt;cyclic&lt;/a&gt;, acyclic, linear or mixed. The term \"conjugated\" was coined in 1899 by the German chemist &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Thiele%20%28chemist%29\"&gt;Johannes Thiele&lt;/a&gt;.\nConjugation is the &lt;a href=\"orbital%20overlap\"&gt;overlap&lt;/a&gt; of one p orbital with another across an adjacent \n&lt;a href=\"Sigma%20bond\"&gt;\u03c3 bond&lt;/a&gt; (in transition metals d orbitals can be involved).\nA conjugated system has a region of overlapping p orbitals, bridging the interjacent locations that simple diagrams illustrate as not having a \u03c0 bond. They allow a delocalization of &lt;a href=\"pi%20electrons\"&gt;\u03c0 electrons&lt;/a&gt; across all the adjacent aligned p orbitals.\nThe \u03c0 electrons do not belong to a single bond or &lt;a href=\"atom\"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;, but rather to a group of atoms.\nThe largest conjugated systems are found in &lt;a href=\"graphene\"&gt;graphene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"graphite\"&gt;graphite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"conductive%20polymer\"&gt;conductive polymer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20nanotube\"&gt;carbon nanotube&lt;/a&gt;s.\nChemical bonding in conjugated systems.\nConjugation is possible by means of alternating single and &lt;a href=\"double%20bond\"&gt;double bond&lt;/a&gt;s in which each atom supplies a p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. However, that is not the only way for conjugation to take place. As long as each contiguous atom in a chain has an available p orbital, the system can be considered conjugated. For example, &lt;a href=\"furan\"&gt;furan&lt;/a&gt; is a five-membered ring with two alternating double bonds flanking an &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;. The oxygen has two &lt;a href=\"lone%20pair\"&gt;lone pair&lt;/a&gt;s, one of which occupies a p orbital perpendicular to the ring on that position, thereby maintaining the conjugation of that five-membered ring by overlap with the perpendicular p orbital on each of the adjacent carbon atoms. The other lone pair remains in plane and does not participate in conjugation.\nIn general, any sp2 or sp-hybridized carbon or &lt;a href=\"heteroatom\"&gt;heteroatom&lt;/a&gt;, including ones bearing an empty orbital or lone pair orbital, can participate in conjugated systems, though lone pairs do not always participate in a conjugated system. For example, in pyridine, the nitrogen atom already participates in the conjugated system through a formal double bond with an adjacent carbon, so the lone pair remains in the plane of the ring in an sp2 hybrid orbital and does not participate in the conjugation. A requirement for conjugation is orbital overlap; thus, the conjugated system must be planar (or nearly so). As a consequence, lone pairs which do participate in conjugated systems will occupy orbitals of pure p character instead of sp\"n\" hybrid orbitals typical for nonconjugated lone pairs.\nA common model for the treatment of conjugated molecules is a composite valence bond / H\u00fcckel molecular orbital theory (VB/HMOT) treatment, in which the \u03c3 framework of the molecule is separated from the \u03c0 system (or systems) of the molecule (\"see the article on the &lt;a href=\"sigma-pi%20and%20equivalent-orbital%20models\"&gt;sigma-pi and equivalent-orbital models&lt;/a&gt; for this model and an alternative treatment\"). Although \u03c3 bonding can be treated using a delocalized approach as well, it is generally the \u03c0 bonding that is being considered when delocalized bonding is invoked in the context of simple organic molecules.\n\"Sigma (\u03c3) framework\": The \u03c3 framework is described by a strictly localized bonding scheme and consists of \u03c3 bonds formed from the interactions between sp3-, sp2-, and sp-&lt;a href=\"Orbital%20hybridisation\"&gt;hybridized atomic orbitals&lt;/a&gt; on the main group elements (and 1s atomic orbitals on hydrogen), together with localized lone pairs derived from filled, nonbonding hybrid orbitals. The interaction that results in \u03c3 bonding takes the form of head-to-head overlap of the larger lobe of each hybrid orbital (or the single spherical lobe of a hydrogen 1s orbital). Each atomic orbital contributes one electron when the orbitals overlap pairwise to form two-electron \u03c3 bonds, or two electrons when the orbital constitutes a lone pair. These localized orbitals (bonding and non-bonding) are all located in the plane of the molecule, with \u03c3 bonds mainly localized between nuclei along the internuclear axis.\n\"Pi (\u03c0) system or systems\": Orthogonal to the \u03c3 framework described above, \u03c0 bonding occurs above and below the plane of the molecule where \u03c3 bonding takes place. The \u03c0 system(s) of the molecule are formed by the interaction of unhybridized p atomic orbitals on atoms employing sp2- and sp-hybridization. The interaction that results in \u03c0 bonding takes place between p orbitals that are adjacent by virtue of a \u03c3 bond joining the atoms and takes the form of side-to-side overlap of the two equally large lobes that make up each p orbital. Atoms that are sp3-hybridized do not have an unhybridized p orbital available for participation in \u03c0 bonding and their presence necessarily terminates a \u03c0 system or separates two \u03c0 systems. A basis p orbital that takes part in a \u03c0 system can contribute one electron (which corresponds to half of a formal \"double bond\"), two electrons (which corresponds to a delocalized \"lone pair\"), or zero electrons (which corresponds to a formally \"empty\" orbital). Bonding for \u03c0 systems formed from the overlap of more than two p orbitals is handled using the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCckel%20method\"&gt;H\u00fcckel approach&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a zeroth order (qualitative) approximation of the \u03c0 symmetry molecular orbitals that result from delocalized \u03c0 bonding.\nThis simple model for chemical bonding is successful for the description of most normal-valence molecules consisting of only s- and p-block elements, although systems that involve electron-deficient bonding, including nonclassical carbocations, lithium and boron clusters, and hypervalent centers require significant modifications in which \u03c3 bonds are also allowed to delocalize and are perhaps better treated with canonical molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule. Likewise, d- and f-block organometallics are also inadequately described by this simple model. Bonds in strained small rings (such as cyclopropane or epoxide) are not well-described by strict \u03c3/\u03c0 separation, as bonding between atoms in the ring consists of \"&lt;a href=\"bent%20bond\"&gt;bent bond&lt;/a&gt;s\" or \"banana bonds\" that are bowed outward and are intermediate in nature between \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds. Nevertheless, organic chemists frequently use the language of this model to rationalize the structure and reactivity of typical organic compounds.\nElectrons in conjugated \u03c0 systems are shared by all adjacent sp2- and sp-hybridized atoms that contribute overlapping, parallel p atomic orbitals. As such, the atoms and \u03c0-electrons involved behave as one large bonded system. These systems are often referred to \"'n\"-center \"k-\"electron \u03c0-bonds,' compactly denoted by the symbol \u03a0, to emphasize this behavior. For example, the delocalized \u03c0 electrons in acetate anion and benzene are said to be involved in \u03a0 and \u03a0 systems, respectively (\"see the article on &lt;a href=\"three-center%20four-electron%20bond\"&gt;three-center four-electron bond&lt;/a&gt;ing\"). It is important to recognize that, generally speaking, these multi-center bonds correspond to the occupation of several molecular orbitals (MOs) with varying degrees of bonding or non-bonding character (filling of orbitals with antibonding character is uncommon). Each one is occupied by one or two electrons in accordance with the &lt;a href=\"aufbau%20principle\"&gt;aufbau principle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hund%27s%20rule%20of%20maximum%20multiplicity\"&gt;Hund's rule&lt;/a&gt;. Cartoons showing overlapping p orbitals, like the one for benzene below, show the basis p atomic orbitals \"before\" they are combined to form molecular orbitals. In compliance with the &lt;a href=\"Pauli%20exclusion%20principle\"&gt;Pauli exclusion principle&lt;/a&gt;, overlapping p orbitals \"do not\" result in the formation of one large MO containing more than two electrons.\n&lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCckel%20method\"&gt;H\u00fcckel MO theory&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used approach to obtain a zeroth order picture of delocalized \u03c0 molecular orbitals, including the mathematical sign of the wavefunction at various parts of the molecule and the locations of nodal planes. It is particularly easy to apply for conjugated hydrocarbons and provides a reasonable approximation as long as the molecule is assumed to be planar with good overlap of p orbitals.\nStabilization energy.\nThe quantitative estimation of stabilization from conjugation is notoriously contentious and depends on the implicit assumptions that are made when comparing reference systems or reactions. The energy of stabilization is known as the resonance energy when formally defined as the difference in energy between the real chemical species and the hypothetical species featuring localized \u03c0 bonding that corresponds to the most stable &lt;a href=\"Resonance%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;resonance form&lt;/a&gt;. This energy cannot be measured, and a precise definition accepted by most chemists will probably remain elusive. Nevertheless, some broad statements can be made. In general, stabilization is more significant for cationic systems than neutral ones. For &lt;a href=\"Butadiene\"&gt;buta-1,3-diene&lt;/a&gt;, a crude measure of stabilization is the activation energy for rotation of the C2-C3 bond. This places the resonance stabilization at around 6 kcal/mol. Comparison of heats of hydrogenation of &lt;a href=\"Pentadiene\"&gt;1,4-pentadiene&lt;/a&gt; and 1,3-pentadiene estimates a slightly more modest value of 3.5 kcal/mol. For comparison, allyl cation has a gas-phase rotation barrier of around 38 kcal/mol, a much greater penalty for loss of conjugation. Comparison of hydride ion affinities of propyl cation and allyl cation, corrected for inductive effects, results in a considerably lower estimate of the resonance energy at 20\u201322 kcal/mol. Nevertheless, it is clear that conjugation stabilizes allyl cation to a much greater extent than buta-1,3-diene. In contrast to the usually minor effect of neutral conjugation, aromatic stabilization can be considerable. Estimates for the resonance energy of benzene range from around 36\u201373 kcal/mol.\nGeneralizations and related concepts.\nThere are also other types of interactions that generalize the idea of interacting p orbitals in a conjugated system. The concept of \"hyperconjugation\" holds that certain \u03c3 bonds can also delocalize into a low-lying unoccupied orbital of a \u03c0 system or an unoccupied p orbital. &lt;a href=\"Hyperconjugation\"&gt;Hyperconjugation&lt;/a&gt; is commonly invoked to explain the stability of alkyl substituted radicals and carbocations. Hyperconjugation is less important for species in which all atoms satisfy the octet rule, but a recent computational study supports hyperconjugation as the origin of the increased stability of alkenes with a higher degree of substitution (&lt;a href=\"Zaitsev%27s%20rule\"&gt;Zaitsev's rule&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"Homoconjugation\" is an overlap of two \u03c0-systems separated by a non-conjugating group, such as CH2. Unambiguous examples are comparatively rare in neutral systems, due to a comparatively minor energetic benefit that is easily overridden by a variety of other factors; however, they are common in cationic systems in which a large energetic benefit can be derived from delocalization of positive charge (\"see the article on &lt;a href=\"homoaromaticity\"&gt;homoaromaticity&lt;/a&gt; for details.\"). Neutral systems generally require constrained geometries favoring interaction to produce significant degrees of homoconjugation. In the example below, the carbonyl stretching frequencies of the IR spectra of the respective compounds demonstrate homoconjugation, or lack thereof, in the neutral ground state molecules.\nDue to the partial \u03c0 character of formally \u03c3 bonds in a cyclopropane ring, evidence for transmission of \"conjugation\" through cyclopropanes has also been obtained.\nTwo appropriately aligned \u03c0 systems whose ends meet at right angles can engage in \"&lt;a href=\"spiroconjugation\"&gt;spiroconjugation&lt;/a&gt;\".\nConjugated cyclic compounds.\n &lt;a href=\"Cyclic%20compound\"&gt;Cyclic compound&lt;/a&gt;s can be partly or completely conjugated. &lt;a href=\"Annulenes\"&gt;Annulenes&lt;/a&gt;, completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons, may be aromatic, nonaromatic or antiaromatic.\nAromatic compounds.\nCompounds that have a monocyclic, planar conjugated system containing &lt;a href=\"4n%2B2%20rule\"&gt;(4\"n\" + 2) \u03c0-electrons&lt;/a&gt; for whole numbers \"n\" are &lt;a href=\"aromaticity\"&gt;aromatic&lt;/a&gt; and exhibit an unusual stability. The classic example &lt;a href=\"benzene\"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt; has a system of six \u03c0 electrons, which, together with the planar ring of C\u2013C \u03c3 bonds containing 12\u00a0electrons and radial C\u2013H \u03c3 bonds containing six electrons, forms the thermodynamically and kinetically stable \"&lt;a href=\"benzene%20ring\"&gt;benzene ring&lt;/a&gt;\", the common core of the benzenoid aromatic compounds. For benzene itself, there are two equivalent conjugated contributing Lewis structures (the so-called Kekul\u00e9 structures) that predominate. The true electronic structure is therefore a quantum-mechanical combination (resonance hybrid) of these contributors, which results in the experimentally observed C\u2013C bonds which are intermediate between single and double bonds and of equal strength and length. In the molecular orbital picture, the six p atomic orbitals of benzene combine to give six molecular orbitals. Three of these orbitals, which lie at lower energies than the isolated p orbital and are therefore net bonding in character (one molecular orbital is strongly bonding, while the other two are equal in energy but bonding to a lesser extent) are occupied by six electrons, while three destabilized orbitals of overall antibonding character remain unoccupied. The result is strong thermodynamic and kinetic aromatic stabilization. Both models describe rings of \u03c0 electron density above and below the framework of C\u2013C \u03c3 bonds.\nNonaromatic and antiaromatic compounds.\nNot all compounds with alternating double and single bonds are aromatic. &lt;a href=\"Cyclooctatetraene\"&gt;Cyclooctatetraene&lt;/a&gt;, for example, possesses alternating single and double bonds. The molecule typically adopts a \"tub\" &lt;a href=\"Conformational%20isomerism\"&gt;conformation&lt;/a&gt;. Because the p orbitals of the molecule do not align themselves well in this non-planar molecule, the \u03c0 bonds are essentially isolated and not conjugated. The lack of conjugation allows the 8 \u03c0 electron molecule to avoid &lt;a href=\"antiaromaticity\"&gt;antiaromaticity&lt;/a&gt;, a destabilizing effect associated with cyclic, conjugated systems containing 4\"n\" \u03c0 (\"n\" = 0, 1, 2, ...) electrons. This effect is due to the placement of two electrons into two degenerate nonbonding (or nearly nonbonding) orbitals of the molecule, which, in addition to drastically reducing the thermodynamic stabilization of delocalization, would either force the molecule to take on triplet diradical character, or cause it to undergo &lt;a href=\"Jahn%E2%80%93Teller%20effect\"&gt;Jahn-Teller distortion&lt;/a&gt; to relieve the degeneracy. This has the effect of greatly increasing the kinetic reactivity of the molecule. Because the effect is so unfavorable, cyclooctatetraene takes on a nonplanar conformation and is nonaromatic in character, behaving as a typical alkene. In contrast, derivatives of the cyclooctatetraene dication and dianion have been found to be planar experimentally, in accord with the prediction that they are stabilized aromatic systems with 6 and 10 \u03c0 electrons, respectively. Because antiaromaticity is a property that molecules try to avoid whenever possible, only a few experimentally observed species are believed to be antiaromatic. &lt;a href=\"Cyclobutadiene\"&gt;Cyclobutadiene&lt;/a&gt; and cyclopentadienyl cation are commonly cited as examples of antiaromatic systems. \nIn pigments.\nIn a conjugated pi-system, electrons are able to capture certain photons as the electrons resonate along a certain distance of p-orbitals - similar to how a &lt;a href=\"antenna%20%28radio%29\"&gt;radio antenna&lt;/a&gt; detects photons along its length. Typically, the more conjugated (longer) the pi-system is, the longer the wavelength of photon can be captured. In other words, with every added adjacent double bond we see in a molecule diagram, we can predict the system will be less likely to absorb yellow light (appear more red to our eyes) and more likely to absorb red light (appear more yellow to our eyes).\nMany &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s make use of conjugated electron systems to absorb &lt;a href=\"visible%20light\"&gt;visible light&lt;/a&gt;, giving rise to strong colors. For example, the long conjugated &lt;a href=\"hydrocarbon\"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt; chain in &lt;a href=\"beta-carotene\"&gt;beta-carotene&lt;/a&gt; leads to its strong orange color. When an electron in the system absorbs a &lt;a href=\"photon\"&gt;photon&lt;/a&gt; of light of the right &lt;a href=\"wavelength\"&gt;wavelength&lt;/a&gt;, it can be promoted to a higher energy level. A simple model of the energy levels is provided by the &lt;a href=\"quantum%20mechanics\"&gt;quantum-mechanical&lt;/a&gt; problem of a one-dimensional &lt;a href=\"particle%20in%20a%20box\"&gt;particle in a box&lt;/a&gt; of length L, representing the movement of a \u03c0 electron along a long conjugated chain of carbon atoms. In this model the lowest possible absorption energy corresponds to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (&lt;a href=\"HOMO/LUMO\"&gt;HOMO&lt;/a&gt;) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For a chain of \"n\" C=C bonds or 2\"n\" carbon atoms in the molecular &lt;a href=\"ground%20state\"&gt;ground state&lt;/a&gt;, there are 2\"n\" \u03c0 electrons occupying \"n\" molecular orbitals, so that the energy gap is\nSince the box length \"L\" increases approximately linearly with the number of C=C bonds \"n\", this means that the energy \u0394\"E\" of a photon absorbed in the HOMO\u2013LUMO transition is approximately proportional to 1/\"n\". The photon &lt;a href=\"wavelength\"&gt;wavelength&lt;/a&gt; \u03bb = \"hc\"/\u0394\"E\" is then approximately proportional to \"n\". Although this model is very approximate, \u03bb does in general increase with \"n\" (or \"L\") for similar molecules. For example, the HOMO\u2013LUMO absorption wavelengths for conjugated &lt;a href=\"1%2C3-Butadiene\"&gt;butadiene&lt;/a&gt;, hexatriene and octatetraene are 217\u00a0nm, 252\u00a0nm and 304\u00a0nm respectively. However, for good numerical agreement of the particle in a box model with experiment, the single-bond/double-bond bond length alternations of the polyenes must be taken into account. Alternatively, one can use the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCckel%20method\"&gt;H\u00fcckel method&lt;/a&gt; which is also designed to model the electronic structure of conjugated systems.\nMany electronic transitions in conjugated \u03c0-systems are from a predominantly &lt;a href=\"covalent%20bond\"&gt;bonding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"molecular%20orbital\"&gt;molecular orbital&lt;/a&gt; (MO) to a predominantly &lt;a href=\"Antibonding%20molecular%20orbital\"&gt;antibonding&lt;/a&gt; MO (\u03c0 to \u03c0*), but electrons from non-bonding &lt;a href=\"lone%20pair\"&gt;lone pair&lt;/a&gt;s can also be promoted to a \u03c0-system MO (n to \u03c0*) as often happens in &lt;a href=\"charge-transfer%20complex\"&gt;charge-transfer complex&lt;/a&gt;es. A HOMO to LUMO transition is made by an electron if it is allowed by the &lt;a href=\"selection%20rules\"&gt;selection rules&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Electromagnetic%20radiation\"&gt;electromagnetic transitions&lt;/a&gt;. Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet region and are colorless to the human eye. With every double bond added, the system absorbs &lt;a href=\"photon\"&gt;photon&lt;/a&gt;s of longer wavelength (and lower energy), and the compound ranges from yellow to red in color. Compounds that are blue or green typically do not rely on conjugated double bonds alone.\nThis absorption of light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum can be quantified using &lt;a href=\"ultraviolet%E2%80%93visible%20spectroscopy\"&gt;ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;, and forms the basis for the entire field of &lt;a href=\"photochemistry\"&gt;photochemistry&lt;/a&gt;.\nConjugated systems that are widely used for synthetic &lt;a href=\"pigment\"&gt;pigment&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"diazo\"&gt;diazo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"azo%20compound\"&gt;azo compound&lt;/a&gt;s and phthalocyanine compounds.\nPhthalocyanine compounds.\nConjugated systems not only have low energy excitations in the visible spectral region but they also accept or donate electrons easily. &lt;a href=\"Phthalocyanine\"&gt;Phthalocyanine&lt;/a&gt;s, which, like &lt;a href=\"Phthalocyanine%20Blue%20BN\"&gt;Phthalocyanine Blue BN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phthalocyanine%20Green%20G\"&gt;Phthalocyanine Green G&lt;/a&gt;, often contain a transition metal ion, exchange an electron with the complexed &lt;a href=\"Transition%20metal%23Characteristic%20properties\"&gt;transition metal ion&lt;/a&gt; that easily changes its &lt;a href=\"oxidation%20state\"&gt;oxidation state&lt;/a&gt;. Pigments and dyes like these are &lt;a href=\"charge-transfer%20complex\"&gt;charge-transfer complex&lt;/a&gt;es.\nPorphyrins and similar compounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Porphyrin\"&gt;Porphyrin&lt;/a&gt;s have conjugated molecular ring systems (&lt;a href=\"macrocycle\"&gt;macrocycle&lt;/a&gt;s) that appear in many &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s of biological systems. As a &lt;a href=\"ligand\"&gt;ligand&lt;/a&gt;, porphyrin forms numerous &lt;a href=\"complex%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;complexes&lt;/a&gt; with metallic ions like &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"hemoglobin\"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt; that colors blood red. Hemoglobin transports oxygen to the cells of our bodies. Porphyrin\u2013metal complexes often have strong colors. A similar molecular structural ring unit called &lt;a href=\"chlorin\"&gt;chlorin&lt;/a&gt; is similarly complexed with &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; instead of iron when forming part of the most common forms of &lt;a href=\"chlorophyll\"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt; molecules, giving them a green color. Another similar macrocycle unit is &lt;a href=\"corrin\"&gt;corrin&lt;/a&gt;, which complexes with &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; when forming part of &lt;a href=\"cobalamin\"&gt;cobalamin&lt;/a&gt; molecules, constituting &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B12\"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, which is intensely red. The corrin unit has six conjugated double bonds but is not conjugated all the way around its macrocycle ring. \nChromophores.\nConjugated systems form the basis of &lt;a href=\"chromophore\"&gt;chromophore&lt;/a&gt;s, which are light-absorbing parts of a molecule that can cause a compound to be colored. Such chromophores are often present in various organic compounds and sometimes present in &lt;a href=\"polymer\"&gt;polymer&lt;/a&gt;s that are colored or glow in the dark. Chromophores often consist of a series of conjugated bonds and/or ring systems, commonly aromatic, which can include C\u2013C, C=C, C=O, or N=N bonds.\nConjugated chromophores are found in many &lt;a href=\"organic%20compound\"&gt;organic compound&lt;/a&gt;s including &lt;a href=\"azo%20dyes\"&gt;azo dyes&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href=\"Food%20coloring\"&gt;artificial food additives&lt;/a&gt;), compounds in fruits and vegetables (&lt;a href=\"lycopene\"&gt;lycopene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anthocyanidin\"&gt;anthocyanidin&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"photoreceptor%20cell\"&gt;photoreceptor&lt;/a&gt;s of the eye, and some pharmaceutical compounds such as the following:"
