The finals were held in Qatar from 7 to 29 January 2011. It was the fifteenth time the tournament has been held, and the second time it has been hosted by Qatar, the other being the &lt;a href=\"1988%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1988 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; won the cup after a 1\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and earned the right to compete in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2013 FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; as the representative from &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt;.\nA television viewing audience of 484 million in 80 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, North America and North Africa witnessed Japan defeat Australia 1\u20130 in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;.\nHost selection.\nQatar, India and Iran all lodged interest in hosting the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, while Australia also considered making a late bid.

Due to FIFA regulations stating that confederation events can be hosted either in January or July, and July being peak summer heat in the Middle East, 2011 Asian Cup took place in January of that year.\nQualification.\nThe teams finishing first, second and third in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and the host nation for the 2011 competition, received automatic byes to the finals. They were joined by the top two finishers in each of five qualifying groups. The &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;AFC Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; acted as a further qualification competition for eligible countries within the emerging and developing category of member associations. The winners of the AFC Challenge Cup competitions in &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Challenge%20Cup%202008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Challenge%20Cup%202010\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; qualified automatically to the 2011 AFC Asian Cup finals.

Max Herman produced the record for Zoul Projects 2011.\nThe music video was released on January 9, 2011.\nConcerns and controversies.\nThe AFC Asian Cup 2011 was not without controversy as concerns were risen about the extremely low crowds at most Asian Cup games not featuring the host nation Qatar. The average attendance was just 12,006, much lower than the previous AFC Asian Cup tournaments. North Korea and the United Arab Emirates both had the lowest attendance numbers with approximately 3,000 and 6,000 attendances respectively. The &lt;a href=\"2011%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final match&lt;/a&gt; between Japan and Australia saw as many as 3,000 to 10,000 fans with valid tickets denied entry to the stadium which then allegedly sparked small skirmishes among fans, \"It was just incredibly badly handled. There were kids and families, not causing any problem, being confronted by riot police and being told they weren't getting in,\" according to &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Richardson%20%28sports%20correspondent%29\"&gt;Andy Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Al%20Jazeera\"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;\"'s sports correspondent. The AFC stated that the gates were closed early for security concerns and organisers did not anticipate an influx of &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20people\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; fans. The organising committee has offered to refund all tickets not redeemed at the match.\nAfter staging the 2006 Asian Games, this Asian Cup was being closely watched as an indicator to see how Qatar copes with hosting a major international football tournament in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2022 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Qatar."
