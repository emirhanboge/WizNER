Shinya captained his school team, and Matsubara was often drawn to watch some of his games.\nShinya moved to Argentina in his second year of high school and signed a professional football contract. Following in his older brothers footsteps, Matsubara sought advice to travel to Argentina himself, but was turned down. After graduating from high school, Matsubara attended university but left shortly after enrolling to reconsider his future. Although Matsubara had represented Japan as a member of the national U17 team, as the &lt;a href=\"J1%20League\"&gt;J1 League&lt;/a&gt; had not been established at the time, he had no particular desire to become a professional football player. It was &lt;a href=\"Kazuyoshi%20Miura\"&gt;Kazuyoshi Miura&lt;/a&gt; who helped change his mind.\nUpon Kazutoshi Miura's triumphal return from Brazil, Matsubara watched one of Miura's games. What he saw that day inspired Matsubara to want to become a professional player. In his pursuit to sign for a professional club, Matsubara participated in trials at his local clubs &lt;a href=\"Shimizu%20S-Pulse\"&gt;Shimizu S-Pulse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BAbilo%20Iwata\"&gt;Yamaha Motors&lt;/a&gt; (Now &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BAbilo%20Iwata\"&gt;J\u00fabilo Iwata&lt;/a&gt;), clubs which were on the brink of joining the &lt;a href=\"J1%20League\"&gt;J1 League&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Matsubara was unsuccessful however, and instead decided to travel abroad to find a club after being recommended by &lt;a href=\"Masakuni%20Yamamoto\"&gt;Masakuni Yamamoto&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Japan Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, who was putting together a team to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nPlaying career.\nStarting in Uruguay, Matsubara moved to Europe to play in Switzerland, Croatia and Germany before making his way back to South America to experience football in Brazil and Argentina. After returning to Japan to play for several clubs in the &lt;a href=\"J1%20League\"&gt;J1 League&lt;/a&gt;, Matsubara retired from football after completing a spell at &lt;a href=\"Fujieda%20MYFC\"&gt;Shizuoka FC&lt;/a&gt; as player manager.\nPersonal life.\nOut of all the countries Matsubara visited, Uruguay left the biggest influence on his life. He learnt Spanish during his time in Uruguay, and now also speaks English, Italian and Portuguese. He continues to play football for fun with other ex-J.Leaguers under a team called FC Infinitos. Matsubara credits Mr. Tagawa, principle of Gyosei International School of making an enormous impression on his life away from football.\nMatsubara has been a big fan of &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; since early childhood, and still keeps a picture of Maradona and himself on his wall.\nAfter his brother returned from Argentina, Shinya joined professional team &lt;a href=\"Shimizu%20S-Pulse\"&gt;Shimizu S-Pulse&lt;/a&gt;. This move set up a rare sibling derby match up when &lt;a href=\"Shimizu%20S-Pulse\"&gt;Shimizu S-Pulse&lt;/a&gt; played Matsubara's team &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BAbilo%20Iwata\"&gt;J\u00fabilo Iwata&lt;/a&gt; in the reserve league. His brother now works in &lt;a href=\"Hamamatsu\"&gt;Hamamatsu&lt;/a&gt; for the Shizuoka Prefecture Football Association, and will work as a coach for &lt;a href=\"Hamamatsu%20University\"&gt;Hamamatsu University&lt;/a&gt; from 2013.\nPost-retirement.\nAfter retiring as a professional player, Matsubara struggled searching for a second career at first. Ultimately he chose to stay working in the world of football however, as a way of giving something back to the sport which made him so successful. Founded on the philosophy of teaching children in a relaxed manner and taking time to concentrate on building character, Matsubara opened his first Football school in 2005, aiming to offer the best children's coaching in the country.\nLater in 2009, Matsubara established FELICE MONDO Inc.

Club teams were also established in Roppongi (junior) and Urayasu (junior youth).\nMatsubara was also involved in the revitalization project of Gyosei International School through football, establishing the Astra International football course, and taking the position of General Manager.
