    "text": "Kosmopoliet I (800 tons) is said to have been one of the first &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20clipper\"&gt;Dutch clipper&lt;/a&gt;s. \n\"Kosmopoliet I\".\nShe was launched on 29 November, 1854 by the shipyard of Cornelis Gips and Sons in &lt;a href=\"Dordrecht\"&gt;Dordrecht&lt;/a&gt;, The Netherlands, for the account of the shipping company of Gebr. Bluss\u00e9 (Dordrecht), inspired by a model of a medium-clipper presented in 1852 at an exhibition in Amsterdam by the Dutch lieutenant-commander M.H. Jansen. \nThe \"Kosmopoliet\" carried both cargo and passengers. She was full-rigged and carried &lt;a href=\"royal%20%28sail%29\"&gt;royals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"skysail\"&gt;skysail&lt;/a&gt;s on all three &lt;a href=\"mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;mast&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThough a voyage from the Netherlands to &lt;a href=\"Java%20%28island%29\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; (port to port) normally took a 100 days or more, the \"Kosmopoliet\" completed her maiden voyage in 89 days. Later she did the passage in 76, 74 and 77 days. \n\"Kosmopoliet II\" and \"Kosmopoliet III\".\nIn 1865 the \"Kosmopoliet II\" (1200 tons) was launched, followed by \"Kosmopoliet III\" in 1871, which measured 1548 tons."
