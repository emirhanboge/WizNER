    "text": "Mary Dawson Cain (August 17, 1904 \u2013 May 6, 1984) was an American &lt;a href=\"newspaper%20editor\"&gt;newspaper editor&lt;/a&gt;, political activist, and gubernatorial candidate in &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, she advocated for conservative causes and is particularly remembered for her campaigns against the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Security%20tax\"&gt;Social Security tax&lt;/a&gt;. She ran for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;Governor of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 1951 and 1955, the first woman to do so.\nLife.\nCain was born in &lt;a href=\"Burke%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Burke, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Charles Goodrich Dawson and Tulula Bryant Dela Garza Dawson. She was educated in public schools in Louisiana and Mississippi, and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Hillman%20College\"&gt;Hillman College&lt;/a&gt;. She married mechanic and business owner John Lambdin Cain in 1924.\nCain owned and edited \"The Summit Sun\", a weekly newspaper in &lt;a href=\"Pike%20County%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Pike County, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, contributing \"Mary Cain's Column\". Cain used her paper to promote &lt;a href=\"Racial%20segregation\"&gt;segregation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; causes, and was particularly critical of the federal government, especially the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Security%20tax\"&gt;Social Security tax&lt;/a&gt;.\nCain became the first woman ever to run for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;Governor of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 1951, when she led an unsuccessful but memorable campaign as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;. She ran again in 1955.\nCain came to national attention in 1952 when she refused to pay $42.87 in Social Security taxes, calling the program \"unconstitutional, immoral and un-American\". She attempted to dodge the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Revenue%20Service\"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; by selling \"The Summit Sun\" to her niece for a nominal sum of $1 and closing her bank accounts. Later that year the IRS seized the paper and padlocked the door; Cain responded by cutting the chains with a hacksaw and sending them back to the agency, earning herself the nickname \"Hacksaw Mary\". Her tax battle went to the Supreme Court; Cain lost, but the government subsequently dropped the suit.\nIn 1965, she appeared in an &lt;a href=\"NBC%20News\"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; documentary titled \"Mississippi: A Self Portrait\", where she proclaimed her support for segregation and its values, particularly in Mississippi. \"I think Mississippi has done wonders with our race relations, she said. I think that is has been a marvelous thing that our Negroes has come as far as they have, and I feel no sense of guilt and I do not have to apologize for what we have done for them.\" Later she elaborated on her views on race, framing them on theological grounds. \"Now I feel that God had a purpose in creating the races separate,\u201d she said. I am so proud of Negroes who are proud of being Negroes. They are what God made them. And I'm proud of being White because I am what my White race has made me. I am White today because my parents practiced segregation, and I wouldn't be anything but White. And I love Negroes who wouldn't be anything but Negroes.\"\nCain died on May 6, 1984 at the age of 79 in &lt;a href=\"McComb%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;McComb, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;."
