    "title": "List of events broadcast on Wide World of Sports (American TV program)",
    "text": "&lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s Wide World of Sports was intended to be a fill-in show for a single summer season, until the start of fall sports seasons, but became unexpectedly popular. The goal of the program was to showcase sports from around the globe that were seldom, if ever, broadcast on American television. It originally ran for two hours on Saturday afternoons, but was later reduced to 90 minutes.\nUsually, \"Wide World\" featured two or three events per show. These included many types not previously seen on American television, such as &lt;a href=\"hurling\"&gt;hurling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rodeo\"&gt;rodeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"curling\"&gt;curling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jai-alai\"&gt;jai-alai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"firefighter\"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;'s competitions, wrist wrestling, &lt;a href=\"powerlifting\"&gt;powerlifting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"surfing\"&gt;surfing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lumberjack\"&gt;logger sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demolition%20derby\"&gt;demolition derby&lt;/a&gt;, slow pitch &lt;a href=\"softball\"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barrel%20jumping\"&gt;barrel jumping&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"badminton\"&gt;badminton&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sprint%20Cup%20Series\"&gt;Grand National/Winston Cup&lt;/a&gt; racing was a \"Wide World of Sports\" staple until the late 1980s, when it became a regularly scheduled sporting event on the network. Traditional Olympic sports such as &lt;a href=\"figure%20skating\"&gt;figure skating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skiing\"&gt;skiing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt; and track and field competitions were also regular features of the show. Another memorable regular feature in the 1960s and 1970s was &lt;a href=\"La%20Quebrada%20Cliff%20Divers\"&gt;Mexican cliff diving&lt;/a&gt;. The lone national television broadcast of the &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Football%20League\"&gt;Continental Football League&lt;/a&gt; was a \"Wide World of Sports\" broadcast of the 1966 championship game; ABC paid the league $500 for a rights fee, a minuscule sum by professional football standards.\n\"Wide World of Sports\" was the first U.S. television program to air coverage of \u2013 among events \u2013 &lt;a href=\"The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; (1961), the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; (highlights starting in 1961; a longer-form version in 1965), the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Men's Basketball Championship&lt;/a&gt; (1962), the &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20500\"&gt;Daytona 500&lt;/a&gt; (1962), the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;U.S. Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; (1962), the &lt;a href=\"Monaco%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Monaco Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; (1962), the &lt;a href=\"Little%20League%20World%20Series\"&gt;Little League World Series&lt;/a&gt; (1961), &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;The British Open Golf Tournament&lt;/a&gt; (1961), the &lt;a href=\"X-Games\"&gt;X-Games&lt;/a&gt; (1994) and the &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup\"&gt;Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; (1962).\n1990s.\n1998.\nNotes.\nOn January 3, 1998, long time \"Wide World of Sports\" host &lt;a href=\"Jim%20McKay\"&gt;Jim McKay&lt;/a&gt; declared that \"Wide World of Sports\" was canceled; the hour-and-a-half of all sorts of sports was replaced by a studio host introducing single event broadcasts such as the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing\"&gt;horse racing's Triple Crown&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships\"&gt;World Championships in figure skating&lt;/a&gt;."
