    "text": "Prafulla Kumar Sen (died 24 March 1942), also known as &lt;a href=\"Swami\"&gt;Swami&lt;/a&gt; Satyananda Puri, was an Indian &lt;a href=\"Indian%20independence%20movement\"&gt;revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; and philosopher. Puri, had in his youth taught &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20philosophy\"&gt;Oriental philosophy&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Calcutta\"&gt;University of Calcutta&lt;/a&gt; and later at &lt;a href=\"Rabindranath%20Tagore\"&gt;Rabindranath Tagore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Visva-Bharati%20University\"&gt;Visva-Bharati University&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Santiniketan\"&gt;Santiniketan&lt;/a&gt;. Encouraged by Tagore, he arrived in &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; in 1932, and in 1939, he founded the &lt;a href=\"Thai-Bharat%20Lodge\"&gt;Thai-Bharat Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, a cultural forum. Arriving in Thailand, Puri was appointed a professor at the &lt;a href=\"Chulalongkorn%20University\"&gt;Chulalongkorn University&lt;/a&gt;, lecturing in ancient Indian and Thai languages, and is said to have mastered the &lt;a href=\"Thai%20Language\"&gt;Thai Language&lt;/a&gt; in six months and went on to translate a number of Indian philosophical works and biographies, including the &lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt; and biographies of &lt;a href=\"Gandhi\"&gt;Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; to Thai. His literary work eventually was more than twenty volumes.\nAt the onset of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 1939, Puri also came to form the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Council\"&gt;Indian National Council&lt;/a&gt; that, along with &lt;a href=\"Giani%20Pritam%20Singh\"&gt;Giani Pritam Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Independence%20League\"&gt;Indian Independence League&lt;/a&gt;, was instrumental in stimulating the evolving Japanese interest in supporting armed Indian resistance for the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20freedom%20movement\"&gt;Indian freedom movement&lt;/a&gt;. Singh and Puri were amongst the first people to negotiate with &lt;a href=\"Fujiwara%20Iwaichi\"&gt;Fujiwara Iwaichi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"F%20Kikan\"&gt;F Kikan&lt;/a&gt; regarding Japanese policies in an effort to obtain a commitment about the support of the movement that ultimately saw the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Independence%20League\"&gt;Indian Independence League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Army\"&gt;Indian National Army&lt;/a&gt;. Both Puri and Pritam Singh were among the Indian delegates killed in a plane crash en route to the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20conference\"&gt;Tokyo conference&lt;/a&gt; in March 1942. The Swami Satyananda Puri foundation was established by the &lt;a href=\"Thai-Bharat%20Cultural%20Lodge\"&gt;Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in 1942 in his honour. The SSPF library today is a reference library that houses many old and rare Indian texts. The foundation is also involved in promoting work on Indian culture, especially on the &lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt;."
