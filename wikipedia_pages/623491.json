    "text": "Abel Tendekayi Muzorewa (14 April 1925 \u2013 8 April 2010), also commonly referred to as Bishop Muzorewa, served as Prime Minister of &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia\"&gt;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Settlement\"&gt;Internal Settlement&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20House%20Agreement\"&gt;Lancaster House Agreement&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. A &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist%20Church\"&gt;United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt; bishop and nationalist leader, he held office for only a few months.\nEarly life.\nMuzorewa was the eldest of a lay preacher's eight children and was educated at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist%20Church\"&gt;United Methodist&lt;/a&gt; School, Old Umtali, near &lt;a href=\"Mutare\"&gt;Mutare&lt;/a&gt;. He was a school teacher at Mrewa between 1943 and 1947 before becoming a full-time lay preacher at Mtoko between 1947 and 1949. He then studied theology at Old Umtali Biblical College (1949\u20131952) and was ordained a Minister at Umtali in August 1953. He was a pastor at Chiduku, near Rusape, from 1955 to 1958.\nMuzorewa attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri, later &lt;a href=\"Central%20Methodist%20University\"&gt;Central Methodist University&lt;/a&gt;. By then he had a wife and three sons, who lived with him in prefabricated student housing, while his sons attended a segregated school. His youngest son Wesley and playmate Mark Elrod (son of the college librarian &lt;a href=\"J.%20McRee%20Elrod\"&gt;J. McRee Elrod&lt;/a&gt;) attempted to integrate the ice cream counter of the local drug store, but were turned away.\nWhen Elrod took Muzorewa to visit &lt;a href=\"Scarritt%20College\"&gt;Scarritt College&lt;/a&gt; in Nashville, Tennessee, they were turned away from an eating facility, an incident he mentions in his autobiography. However, he later graduated as a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Master of Arts&lt;/a&gt; from Scarritt (now a conference center).\nIn July 1963, Muzorewa became pastor of Old Umtali. A year later he was appointed National Director of the Christian Youth Movement and was seconded to the Christian Council. In 1966, he became Secretary of the Student Christian Movement. In 1968, at Masera in &lt;a href=\"Botswana\"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, he was consecrated as the &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist%20Church\"&gt;United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt;'s Bishop of &lt;a href=\"Rhodesia\"&gt;Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical career.\nUnited African National Council.\nIn 1971 the British government struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Smith\"&gt;Ian Smith&lt;/a&gt; that provided for a transition to \"majority rule\" in exchange for an end to sanctions against the government. Muzorewa joined an inexperienced cleric, the Reverend &lt;a href=\"Canaan%20Banana\"&gt;Canaan Banana&lt;/a&gt;, to form the &lt;a href=\"United%20African%20National%20Council\"&gt;United African National Council&lt;/a&gt; (UANC) to oppose the settlement, under the acronym NIBMAR (&lt;a href=\"no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule\"&gt;no independence before majority rule&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe proposed referendum was withdrawn and Muzorewa found himself a national leader and an international personality. The government opposition movements\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union\"&gt;Zimbabwe African National Union&lt;/a&gt; (ZANU) of Reverend &lt;a href=\"Ndabaningi%20Sithole\"&gt;Ndabaningi Sithole&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20African%20People%27s%20Union\"&gt;Zimbabwe African People's Union&lt;/a&gt; (ZAPU) of &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Nkomo\"&gt;Joshua Nkomo&lt;/a&gt;\u2014both placed themselves under the UANC umbrella even though they had some doubts when Muzorewa founded a national party.\nAfter ZANU (led by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Mugabe\"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; after disagreements with Sithole) and ZAPU undertook guerrilla warfare, the UANC was the only legal &lt;a href=\"black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; party, since it rejected violence.\nInternal Settlement.\nOn 3 March 1978, Muzorewa, Sithole and other non-exiled leaders signed an agreement at Government House, &lt;a href=\"Harare\"&gt;Salisbury&lt;/a&gt;, which paved the way for the interim government, the leadership of which was an Executive Council made up of Muzorewa, Sithole and &lt;a href=\"Jeremiah%20Chirau\"&gt;Jeremiah Chirau&lt;/a&gt;, along with Ian Smith.\nThis Executive Council was to run the affairs of state prior to elections taking place. A new constitution was drafted reserving 10 seats in the Senate and 28 seats in the House of Assembly for the &lt;a href=\"Whites%20in%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;white minority&lt;/a&gt;, and a quarter of the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Rhodesia\"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; positions. The constitution was approved in a nearly whites-only &lt;a href=\"1979%20Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; that took place in January 1979. An overwhelming majority of 85% voted yes.\nElections were held, and the UANC won. &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Zion%20Gumede\"&gt;Josiah Gumede&lt;/a&gt; was the first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;, Muzorewa became prime minister and the country's name was changed to &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia\"&gt;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt;. However, the war that Smith hoped to stem as a result of the settlement continued unabated. Mugabe and Nkomo rejected the settlement, ending any realistic chance for Muzorewa to gain any international legitimacy. While ZANU and ZAPU could have taken part in the elections if they laid down their arms, they refused to do so. The internal settlement was also condemned by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20423\"&gt;United Nations Security Council Resolution 423&lt;/a&gt; of 1978, which declared any settlement drafted under the \"illegal racist minority regime\" to be \"illegal and unacceptable.\"\nLancaster House Agreement.\nThe British government asked all parties to come to London for negotiations to find a lasting solution to the &lt;a href=\"Rhodesian%20Bush%20War\"&gt;Bush War&lt;/a&gt;. Nkomo and Mugabe attended the conference under the \"Patriotic Front\" (PF) banner. The conference was held from 10 September to 15 December 1979, under the chairmanship of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Carington%2C%206th%20Baron%20Carrington\"&gt;Lord Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, the British Foreign Secretary. Muzorewa was persuaded to accept fresh elections, to be held in early 1980. In accordance with the final agreement, Muzorewa's government revoked UDI on 11 December 1979 and dissolved itself. As part of a transition to internationally recognised independence, the country once again became the British colony of Southern Rhodesia pending elections.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1980%20Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election\"&gt;parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; took place at the end of February 1980, after a campaign filled with much intimidation by Mugabe's ZANU. The British government briefly considered disqualifying ZANU from participating in the elections for flagrant violation of the Lancaster House Agreement, but in the end did nothing. On 4 March 1980, the elections resulted in a majority for Mugabe and ZANU. The UANC won only three out of 80 seats reserved for Africans in the House of Assembly. Under Mugabe, \"Zimbabwe Rhodesia\" became the Republic of Zimbabwe, or \"&lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVisit to Israel, arrest and hunger strike.\nMuzorewa visited &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; on 21 October 1983. He urged Mugabe to establish diplomatic relations, saying his political policies hurt Zimbabwe's agriculture and technology industries. The Zimbabwean government arrested Muzorewa on 1 November on charges of conspiring against Mugabe for the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20government\"&gt;South African government&lt;/a&gt;. Two days later Mugabe warned &lt;a href=\"Ndabaningi%20Sithole\"&gt;Ndabaningi Sithole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Nkomo\"&gt;Joshua Nkomo&lt;/a&gt; against 'conspiring'. Muzorewa then went on a hunger strike, which lasted from 3 to 11 November.\n1996 and 2008 presidential elections.\nMuzorewa stood against Mugabe in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Zimbabwean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential election of 1996&lt;/a&gt;, but pulled out after the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; turned down his bid to postpone the elections on the basis that the electoral rules were unfair (as state funds were only available to parties with 15 or more seats in &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;). He remained on the ballot and won 4.8% of the popular vote.\nOn 21 June 2007, Muzorewa said citizens, black and white alike, came to his house and asked him to run for president. He said Zimbabwe was \"bleeding, economically and socially. It is painful to listen to them talk.\" He asked people to pray that negotiations between ZANU-PF and the MDC, mediated by South African President &lt;a href=\"Thabo%20Mbeki\"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;, would be successful and for Zimbabwe's \"salvation.\" Ultimately Muzorewa did not run in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Zimbabwean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath and burial.\nMuzorewa died aged 84 from cancer at his home in &lt;a href=\"Harare\"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt; on 8 April 2010. The Director of Christian Care, Reverend Forbes Matonga, described Muzorewa's legacy as including \"his role in the country's transition to independence, the Methodist Church and the founding of &lt;a href=\"Africa%20University\"&gt;Africa University&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern Zimbabwean city of &lt;a href=\"Mutare\"&gt;Mutare&lt;/a&gt;\". Political commentator &lt;a href=\"John%20Makumbe\"&gt;John Makumbe&lt;/a&gt; said Muzorewa's legacy in Zimbabwe would be that of \"a man of peace\".\nBishop Muzorewa and his wife are buried at the Old &lt;a href=\"Mutare\"&gt;Mutare&lt;/a&gt; Mission Station, Mutare, &lt;a href=\"Manicaland%20Province\"&gt;Manicaland Province&lt;/a&gt;."
