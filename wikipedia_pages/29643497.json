It is one of the financial services institutions licensed by the &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20Bank%20of%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; and national banking regulator.\nLocation.\nThe headquarters and main branch of the bank are located on the 3rd Floor of Union House, at 60 Kwame Nkrumah Avenue, in downtown &lt;a href=\"Harare\"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;, the capital and largest city in Zimbabwe.

In the second quarter of 2010, CBZ Bank merged its operations with those of CBZ Building Society, a process that required regulatory approval. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe approved the merger in October 2012 and the process was concluded in February 2013.\nOwnership.\nAccording to the December 2017 Annual Report of the CBZ Holdings Limited (CBZ Group), whose shares of &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; are traded on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the major shareholders in the Group were as listed in the table below:\nBranches.\nAs of 30 June 2014, CBZ Bank Limited maintained a network of branches at 66 locations in all major urban centres of Zimbabwe."
