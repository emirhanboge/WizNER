    "text": "Carl Albert Fritz Michael Gerlich (15 February 1883 \u2013 30 June 1934) was a German &lt;a href=\"journalist\"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"historian\"&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the main journalistic resistors of &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested, later killed and cremated at the &lt;a href=\"Dachau%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Dachau concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nGerlich was born in &lt;a href=\"Stettin\"&gt;Stettin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pomerania%20%281815%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;, and grew up as the eldest of the three sons of wholesale and retail &lt;a href=\"fishmonger\"&gt;fishmonger&lt;/a&gt; Paul Gerlich and his wife Therese. In Autumn 1889, Gerlich was enrolled in the Marienstiftungymnasium (Our Lady's Grammar School) and graduated from his senior class there in 1901.\nIn 1902 he began his studies at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;University of Munich&lt;/a&gt;, and first majored in mathematics and natural sciences before switching to history. At the university, he was an active member of the &lt;a href=\"Freistudentenschaft\"&gt;Freistudentenschaft&lt;/a&gt; (Free Student Union, sometimes translated as Free Student Association). He wrote his doctoral dissertation \"The Testament of Henry VI\" and completed it in 1907.\nOn 9 October 1920, he married Sophie Botzenhart, born Stempfle, in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nAfter completing his studies with a doctorate, Gerlich became an archivist.\nHe also began to contribute political articles that were anti-&lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; in the publications \"&lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCddeutsche%20Monatshefte\"&gt;S\u00fcddeutsche Monatshefte&lt;/a&gt;\", which was edited by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Nikolaus%20Cossmann\"&gt;Paul Nikolaus Cossmann&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Die Wirklichkeit\" (in 1917). In 1917, he also became active in the &lt;a href=\"Fatherland%20Party%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;German Fatherland Party&lt;/a&gt; (Deutsche Vaterlandspartei) and after it was dissolved in the Anti-Bolshevist League (Antibolschewistische Liga) (1918/19).\nIn 1919, he published the book \"Communism as the Theory of the Thousand Year Reich\" (\"Der Kommunismus als Lehre vom Tausendj\u00e4hrigen Reich\"), where Gerlich compared &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; with the phenomenon of redemption religion. A whole chapter in the work is devoted to denouncing &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt;, which had gained ground because of the leading positions of many &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s in the Revolution and founding of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic\"&gt;Bavarian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nGerlich held conservative views and published several anti-socialist articles in the right-wing press.\nEditor-in-chief of the \"M\u00fcnchner Neueste Nachrichten\".\nFrom 1920 to 1928 he was editor in chief of the \"M\u00fcnchner Neueste Nachrichten\" (MNN), a predecessor to today's \"&lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung\"&gt;S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" in that its circulation was one of the largest in southern Germany. As editor, Gerlich opposed &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt; and Hitler's &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; as \"murderous\". In the early 1920s, he had seen proof of Nazi tyranny already in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. Once a conservative nationalist, after the 1923 &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Hall%20Putsch\"&gt;Beer Hall Putsch&lt;/a&gt; Gerlich decisively turned against Hitler and became one of his fiercest critics. Other critics of the Nazis at MNN were later arrested within days of Gerlich, such as: &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20Buechner\"&gt;Fritz Buechner&lt;/a&gt;, who followed Gerlich as the editor of the MNN, &lt;a href=\"Erwein%20Freiherr%20von%20Aretin\"&gt;Erwein Freiherr von Aretin&lt;/a&gt;, who was domestic editor at the MNN, and Cossmann, who wrote for the MNN, all of whom had steered the MNN to support a return of the monarchy.\nFriendship with Therese Neumann.\nBy 1927, he had befriended &lt;a href=\"Therese%20Neumann\"&gt;Therese Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mysticism\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Konnersreuth\"&gt;Konnersreuth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, who supported Gerlich's resistance activities. Initially, he wanted to expose her &lt;a href=\"Stigmata\"&gt;stigmatism&lt;/a&gt; as a fraud, but Gerlich came back a changed man and later &lt;a href=\"religious%20conversion\"&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. From that year until his death, his resistance became inspired by the social teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\"The Straight Path\" newspaper.\nGerlich returned in November 1929 to his job at the Bavarian National Archives. A circle of friends that had developed around Neumann gave rise to the idea of founding a weekly political newspaper to dispute the &lt;a href=\"political%20left\"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"political%20right\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; political extremism in Germany. Supported by a wealthy patron, Prince &lt;a href=\"Waldburg-Zeil\"&gt;Waldburg-Zeil&lt;/a&gt;, Gerlich was able to take over the weekly newspaper \"Sunday Illustrated\" (\"Der Illustrierte Sonntag\"), which was renamed \"The Straight Path\" (\"Der Gerade Weg\") in 1932.\nIn this newspaper, Gerlich opposed Communism, National Socialism and antisemitism. The dispute with the growing &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; movement became the central focus of Gerlich and his later writing. At the end of 1932 the circulation of the weekly was over 40,000 readers.\nGerlich once wrote \"National Socialism means: Enmity with neighbouring nations, tyranny internally, civil war, world war, lies, hatred, &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Afratricide\"&gt;fratricide&lt;/a&gt; and boundless want.\"\nArrest and death at Dachau.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Machtergreifung\"&gt;Nazis seized power&lt;/a&gt; on 30 January 1933, Gerlich was arrested 9 March 1933 and held at the &lt;a href=\"Dachau%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Dachau concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;, where he died on 30 June 1934 during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Long%20Knives\"&gt;Night of the Long Knives&lt;/a&gt;. His death was officially announced days after his arrest, and the announcement was published in the international press at the time. He was cremated and his ashes given to his wife.\nFictional portrayals.\nGerlich was portrayed in the TV movie \"\" by actor &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Modine\"&gt;Matthew Modine&lt;/a&gt;. In the film, as he dictates a front-page article that warns of the danger that Hitler poses, Gerlich finishes with the words: \"The worst thing we can do, the absolute worst, is to do nothing\". This line is inspired by a quote often incorrectly attributed to &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Burke\"&gt;Edmund Burke&lt;/a&gt;: \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\""
