    "text": "SCM Rugby Timi\u0219oara is a professional Romanian &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;, which plays in the &lt;a href=\"SuperLiga%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;CEC Bank SuperLiga&lt;/a&gt;, the first division of Romanian rugby. The team first won the championship in 1972, becoming the first club outside &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this performance. In the modern format of the SuperLiga, SCM Rugby Timi\u0219oara won 4 titles in 6 seasons.\nThe team is colloquially known as \"Universitatea\" Timi\u0219oara as it has historical ties with the &lt;a href=\"West%20University%20of%20Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;University of Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014 the club became a partner of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Saracens%20F.C.\"&gt;Saracens&lt;/a&gt; rugby club. In 2020, the club's partnership with &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Saracens%20F.C.\"&gt;Saracens&lt;/a&gt; rugby club ended making them change their identity to SCM Rugby Timi\u0219oara. SCM Rugby Timisoara`s annual operating budget for the 2020-21 season is approximately 910,000 &lt;a href=\"Euro\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1949, CSUT (Club Sportiv Universitar Timi\u0219oara) played its first match in the city of &lt;a href=\"Sighi%C5%9Foara\"&gt;Sighi\u015foara&lt;/a&gt; against the local team, that match was won by CSUT with a score of 34\u20130, the team from Timi\u0219oara having the following line-up: Liteanu, Antonescu, Popa, Nistor, Haller, Onciul, Zomborian, Georgescu (player-coach), D\u0103ncescu, Gurti, Kalincov, Barla, Baruch, Balios and Melinte.\nName change and first National title.\nStarting with the year 1966 the team changes its name from CSUT to Universitatea Timi\u0219oara; Mitic\u0103 Antonescu was in charge of the team at that point. The year 1966 was the start of the ascension for the team from Timi\u0219oara. In the 1968\u201369 championship the team occupies 5th place, in the 1969\u201370 championship the team occupies 3rd place, in the 1970\u201371 championship the team occupies 5th place and in the 1971\u201372 championship, Universitatea Timi\u0219oara \u2013 after 58 years of supremacy from the teams from Bucharest \u2013 manages to bring the national title to Timi\u0219oara.\nIt is said that on 12 June 1972 (the day the team won the national title) the bells of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Timi\u0219oara rang one time more than usual, and on the second day at the gate of the boarding house where the majority of the rugby players of Universitatea Timi\u0219oara were living, on a board the following could be read: \"\"Trec\u0103torule, opre\u0219te-te un moment \u0219i \u00eenclin\u0103-te \u00een fa\u021ba u\u0219ii caminului unde tr\u0103iesc perlele rugby-ului rom\u00e2nesc\" (translation: Passer-by, stop for a moment and take a bow in front of the door of the boarding house where the pearls of Romanian rugby are living)\", the author of it being, at that time student, Nicolae Benga. Here are the artisans of this beautiful achievement: Du\u0163\u0103, Szasz, C\u00e2ndrea, Peter, Suciu, Ghe\u0163u, Iacob, Ceau\u015f, T\u0103tucu, Nedelcu, Vollman, R\u0103\u0219canu, Priess, Ionic\u0103, Ene, Malancu, Neiss, Popovici, Vlad, Ioni\u021b\u0103, Arsene.\nChester Williams Era.\nIn January 2012, former Springbok &lt;a href=\"Chester%20Williams\"&gt;Chester Williams&lt;/a&gt; (the only non-white player in South Africa's winning &lt;a href=\"1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1995 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; team) joined Timi\u0219oara Saracens as head coach. His first attempt to get involved with Romanian rugby was being the technical director for &lt;a href=\"CS%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;CS Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. He was close to taking over the bench of &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2011, but negotiations were put to a hold because of the World Cup that was taking place in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams brought Timi\u0219oara their first league title in 40 years in 2012. He was then replaced by fellow South African Danie de Villiers. In 2014, former New Zealand Heartland XV coach Grainger Heikell took over from De Villiers as head coach of Timi\u0219oara Saracens.\nAfter two successful seasons for Timi\u0219oara, Chester Williams eventually returned to replace Danie de Villiers.\nRomanian Cup.\nIn 2011, Timi\u0219oara Saracens RCM UVT won the Romanian Cup for the first time, after a 32\u201310 victory against &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Baia%20Mare%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;CSM Stiin\u0163a Baia-Mare&lt;/a&gt;. The match took place in &lt;a href=\"Alba%20Iulia\"&gt;Alba Iulia&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Cetate%20%28Alba%20Iulia%29\"&gt;Cetate Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimi\u0219oara Saracens won the Romania Cup once again in 2014 with a victory over &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Baia%20Mare%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;CSM Stiin\u0163a Baia-Mare&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Cluj%20Arena\"&gt;Cluj Arena&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to repeat their cup success in 2015 and 2016.\nRomanian Rugby Championship (pre-2012) and SuperLiga (2012-).\nIn 2011, Timi\u0219oara Saracens RCM UVT finished in 3rd place. After losing 22\u201324 to &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Baia%20Mare%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;CSM \u0218tiin\u021ba Baia Mare&lt;/a&gt; in the semifinals of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;Romanian Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt;, the team from &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara&lt;/a&gt; won the 3rd place final against &lt;a href=\"Farul%20Constan%C5%A3a%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Farul Constan\u0163a&lt;/a&gt; (15\u201311). Under Chester Williams' management, they won the league in 2012 and 2013.\nIn 2014, Timi\u0219oara lost against Farul Constan\u021ba in the league semi-finals, after the medical visas were allegedly ripped out of the files of Timi\u0219oara Saracen's top six players. This is one of many corruption accusations made by the team.\nTimi\u0219oara Saracens won the league again in 2015 and 2016\u201317. These two finals, as well as the finals in 2012 and 2013, were played against CSM \u0218tiin\u021ba Baia Mare. Timi\u0219oara won 8 out of 8 finals (in the SuperLiga, Romanian Cup and King's Cup) they played against Baia Mare.\nDuring August 2020, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Timi%C8%99oara%20Saracens\"&gt;Timi\u0219oara Saracens RCM UVT&lt;/a&gt; will restart in the &lt;a href=\"SuperLiga%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;SuperLiga&lt;/a&gt; under the new name of SCM Timi\u0219oara Rugby.\nCurrent squad.\nThe SCM Rugby Timi\u0219oara squad for the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20SuperLiga%20season\"&gt;2020\u201321 SuperLiga season&lt;/a&gt; is:"
