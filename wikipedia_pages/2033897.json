His reign ended in 2020 when Brees surpassed him. \nCalvillo won three &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup\"&gt;Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; championships in &lt;a href=\"90th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"97th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"98th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, and named &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup%20Most%20Valuable%20Player\"&gt;Grey Cup Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

Calvillo announced his retirement on January 21, 2014. Calvillo was an assistant coach for the Alouettes from 2015 to 2017 and with the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Argonauts\"&gt;Toronto Argonauts&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nEarly life, high school career, and family.\nCalvillo was born in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. While attending &lt;a href=\"La%20Puente%20High%20School\"&gt;La Puente High School&lt;/a&gt;, he was a two-sport standout in &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. He is of &lt;a href=\"Mexican-American\"&gt;Mexican-American&lt;/a&gt; descent.\nAnthony grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father. Sports were his escape.\nCollege career.\nCalvillo spent two seasons at &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20San%20Antonio%20College\"&gt;Mt. San Antonio College&lt;/a&gt; before transferring to &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20University\"&gt;Utah State University&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. After a solid junior year as starting &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt;, he had a terrific senior season in 1993. He set a school record with 3,260 yards of total offense in the regular season, and he also set a school record with five touchdown passes in a single game (he did it twice). With Calvillo leading the offense, USU won the &lt;a href=\"Big%20West%20Conference\"&gt;Big West Conference&lt;/a&gt; championship for the first time since 1979. The Aggies finished the year with a 42\u201333 win over &lt;a href=\"Ball%20State%20Cardinals%20football\"&gt;Ball State&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Bowl\"&gt;Las Vegas Bowl&lt;/a&gt;; Calvillo passed for 386 yards and three &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s to win MVP honors. It was Utah State's first-ever bowl victory. Calvillo wore number 13 and played under former NFL Seattle Seahawks quarterback, Jim Zorn. It wasn't until his last year of university when he began to believe that he could be a professional football player, even though he was not invited to attend the NFL evaluation day at his University.\nProfessional career.\nLas Vegas Posse.\nAfter not being drafted by an NFL team, Calvillo started his &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt; career in &lt;a href=\"1994%20CFL%20season\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; with the US expansion &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Posse\"&gt;Las Vegas Posse&lt;/a&gt;. Calvillo beat out 13 other Quarterbacks who were trying to make the team. Again, he wore # 13.\nHamilton Tiger-Cats.\nAfter the Posse folded a year later in the &lt;a href=\"CFL%20USA\"&gt;CFL U.S. expansion&lt;/a&gt; experiment, Calvillo was selected first overall by the &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Tiger-Cats\"&gt;Hamilton Tiger-Cats&lt;/a&gt; in the dispersal draft. While in Hamilton, Calvillo served as a backup quarterback to players such as &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Taylor%20%28quarterback%29\"&gt;Steve Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Dunigan\"&gt;Matt Dunigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMontreal Alouettes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1998%20CFL%20season\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo signed as a free agent with the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Alouettes\"&gt;Montreal Alouettes&lt;/a&gt;, where he became one of the most outstanding quarterbacks in history. He led the Alouettes to the &lt;a href=\"90th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;2002 Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt;, their first in 25 years, where he was named the &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup%20Most%20Valuable%20Player\"&gt;most valuable player in the game&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2003%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2003 CFL season&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo broke numerous Montreal Alouette passing records, completing 408 of 675 passing attempts for 5,891 yards and 37 touchdowns. In &lt;a href=\"2004%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, with 6,041 passing yards, Calvillo became the fourth quarterback in CFL history to pass for more than 6,000 yards in a single season (&lt;a href=\"Doug%20Flutie\"&gt;Doug Flutie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Archer%20%28quarterback%29\"&gt;David Archer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Austin\"&gt;Kent Austin&lt;/a&gt; being the other three), earning him the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League%20East%20Division\"&gt;East Division&lt;/a&gt; nomination for &lt;a href=\"CFL%27s%20Outstanding%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Outstanding Player&lt;/a&gt; for the third consecutive year. With Calvillo quarterbacking the Alouettes' offence, the 2004 Alouettes became the first team in CFL history to have four players with over 1,000 yards receiving in the same season: Ben Cahoon (1183 yards), Jeremaine Copeland (1154 yards), Thyron Anderson (1147 yards), and Kwame Cavil (1090 yards). In 2005, Calvillo and the Alouettes repeated the feat of four receivers over 1,000 yards: Kerry Watkins (1364 yards), Terry Vaughn (1113 yards), Ben Cahoon (1067 yards), and Dave Stala (1037 yards).\nThe &lt;a href=\"2008%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2008 CFL season&lt;/a&gt; saw Calvillo hit a number of career milestones. On June 26, in a game against the &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Tiger-Cats\"&gt;Hamilton Tiger-Cats&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo surpassed &lt;a href=\"Danny%20McManus\"&gt;Danny McManus&lt;/a&gt; to become the second-all-time leading passer in the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;CFL&lt;/a&gt;. On July 31, in another game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Calvillo became the fourth quarterback in league history to reach 300 career touchdown passes. On August 15, 2008, in a game against the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Argonauts\"&gt;Toronto Argonauts&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo became the second quarterback in CFL history after Damon Allen to reach 4,000 career pass completions. With 5,633 passing yards and 43 touchdown passes, Calvillo won the 2008 Most Outstanding Player award. Calvillo led the Montreal Alouettes to the &lt;a href=\"96th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;2008 Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; final, which the Alouettes lost 22-14 to the &lt;a href=\"Calgary%20Stampeders\"&gt;Calgary Stampeders&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo added to his club records while reaching more CFL milestones. On July 23, 2009, he surpassed Canadian Football Hall of Famer &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Lancaster\"&gt;Ron Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;'s 334 career touchdown passes to move into second place all time. He sat out two games during the regular season, but still accumulated 4639 yards while posting a remarkable 72.0% completion rate, the second best single-season completion rate in CFL history behind &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Dickenson\"&gt;Dave Dickenson&lt;/a&gt;'s 73.98% mark set in &lt;a href=\"2005%20BC%20Lions%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. Calvillo led Montreal to a 16-point fourth quarter comeback victory in the &lt;a href=\"97th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;97th Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 29, when the Alouettes defeated the &lt;a href=\"Saskatchewan%20Roughriders\"&gt;Saskatchewan Roughriders&lt;/a&gt; 28-27 on a last-second field goal known as the \"13th Man\" finish.\nCalvillo won his third Grey Cup on November 28, 2010, at &lt;a href=\"98th%20Grey%20Cup\"&gt;98th Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%2C%20Alberta\"&gt;Edmonton, Alberta&lt;/a&gt; where he defeated the &lt;a href=\"Saskatchewan%20Roughriders\"&gt;Saskatchewan Roughriders&lt;/a&gt; 21-18 for the second year in a row. He added to his record total of passing yards in Grey Cup games with 2470 yards, as well as setting the record for Grey Cup starts with eight. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2010 CFL season&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo is 3-5 in Grey Cup Championship Games.\nIn a post-game interview, he revealed that he would be undergoing off-season surgery to remove a lesion on his &lt;a href=\"thyroid\"&gt;thyroid&lt;/a&gt; that was discovered after he injured his sternum during the season. On December 21, 2010, it was reported that Calvillo had successful thyroidectomy surgery to remove a cancerous lesion.\nOn July 15, 2011, in a game against the Toronto Argonauts, Calvillo completed his CFL record 395th career touchdown pass to &lt;a href=\"%C3%89ric%20Deslauriers\"&gt;\u00c9ric Deslauriers&lt;/a&gt;. On August 4 of that same season, and again against the Argonauts, Calvillo completed his 5159th pass completion to &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20London\"&gt;Brandon London&lt;/a&gt; to move past &lt;a href=\"Damon%20Allen\"&gt;Damon Allen&lt;/a&gt; to become the leader in that category as well. Then, on October 10, 2011, Calvillo completed a touchdown pass to &lt;a href=\"Jamel%20Richardson\"&gt;Jamel Richardson&lt;/a&gt; to become professional football's all-time leading passer, in the Alouettes' third and final game against the Toronto Argonauts that year. In 2012, Calvillo became the only player in football history to pass 5,000 yards seven times in his career. He reached 4,000 yards passing eleven times in his career (a CFL record); only &lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Manning\"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; has reached the 4,000 mark more times in his career with fourteen 4,000 yard seasons. He also set another CFL record having 8 consecutive 300+ passing yards games in a single season, breaking the record he shared with Doug Flutie.\nCalvillo signed a two-year contract on December 13, 2012, with the deal keeping him with the Als through the 2014 season. In Week 8 of the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CFL%20season\"&gt;2013 CFL season&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo left the game after taking a hit from Saskatchewan's &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Foley\"&gt;Ricky Foley&lt;/a&gt;. Three days after the game, it was announced that he had suffered a concussion, and missed the Week 9 game against the &lt;a href=\"BC%20Lions\"&gt;BC Lions&lt;/a&gt; and the Week 10 game against the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Argonauts\"&gt;Toronto Argonauts&lt;/a&gt;. On September 4, 2013, the Als placed Calvillo on the 9-game injury list. On October 18, 2013, the Montreal Alouettes general manager and head coach &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Popp\"&gt;Jim Popp&lt;/a&gt; announced that Calvillo would not be returning to play for the remainder of the 2013 season.\nOn January 21, 2014, Calvillo announced his retirement from professional football. Before his retirement, he was offered the offensive coordinator position with the Alouettes but declined. On October 13, 2014, Calvillo's jersey number, #13, was retired in a halftime ceremony at McGill Stadium. Upon his retirement, he was the last active player that played for an American-based CFL team during its expansion to the US in the mid-1990s.\nCoaching career.\nMontreal Alouettes.\nOn December 15, 2014, the Montreal Alouettes announced that Calvillo would be joining the team as an offensive coach in 2015.

After a few weeks, the team's &lt;a href=\"offensive%20coordinator\"&gt;offensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turk%20Schonert\"&gt;Turk Schonert&lt;/a&gt;, was fired and Calvillo was named co-offensive coordinator along with &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Dinwiddie\"&gt;Ryan Dinwiddie&lt;/a&gt;. Going into the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Montreal%20Alouettes%20season\"&gt;2016 season&lt;/a&gt;, Calvillo was named offensive coordinator with &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Chapdelaine\"&gt;Jacques Chapdelaine&lt;/a&gt; as his special advisor as he grew into the role.
