    "text": "The United States sent a delegation to compete at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2008 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 213 U.S. competitors took part in 18 sports; the only 2 sports Americans did not compete in were &lt;a href=\"Football%205-a-side%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;soccer 5-a-side&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Football%207-a-side%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;7-a-side&lt;/a&gt;. The American delegation included 16 former members of the U.S. military, including 3 veterans of the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. Among them were shot putter &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Winkler%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Scott Winkler&lt;/a&gt;, who was paralyzed in an accident in Iraq, and swimmer &lt;a href=\"Melissa%20Stockwell\"&gt;Melissa Stockwell&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; officer who lost her left leg to a roadside bomb in the war.\nThe United States finished third in the gold and overall medal count, behind host nation &lt;a href=\"China%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. The finish was an improvement from the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2004 Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;, where the U.S. finished fourth in the gold and overall medal count. The U.S. saw significant gains in Paralympic swimming, winning 17 gold medals and 44 total medals, 9 more than they took home from Athens. U.S. swimmers set a total of 16 world records, 23 Paralympic records, 48 Pan American records and 99 American records. U.S. coverage of the Games was provided by the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Sports\"&gt;Universal Sports Television Network&lt;/a&gt; and the official website of the U.S. Paralympic Team.\nDisability classifications.\nEvery participant at the Paralympics had their disability grouped into one of five &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Paralympic%20Games%23Disability%20categories\"&gt;disability categories&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"amputation\"&gt;amputation&lt;/a&gt; (either congenital or sustained through injury or illness); &lt;a href=\"cerebral%20palsy\"&gt;cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; athletes (often overlapping with other categories); &lt;a href=\"visual%20impairment\"&gt;visual impairment&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;); and les autres (any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example &lt;a href=\"dwarfism\"&gt;dwarfism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"multiple%20sclerosis\"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;). Each &lt;a href=\"Paralympic%20Games%23Summer%20sports\"&gt;Paralympic sport&lt;/a&gt; then had its own classifications, depending on the specific physical demands of the competition. Events were given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, divided athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities. Other sports, such as &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, grouped competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.\nAthletes may have competed against individuals with different classifications in the same event. For example, track and field athlete &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bob%20Bizzell\"&gt;Jim Bob Bizzell&lt;/a&gt; competed in the &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20200%20metres%20T44\"&gt;men's 200\u00a0meters T44&lt;/a&gt;; the prefix T designated a track event and 44 was the disability classification. Although he finished behind &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Pistorius\"&gt;Oscar Pistorius&lt;/a&gt; (competing under the T43 class), Bizell set a world record in the T44 classification. For specific classification information, see the pages for individual sports at &lt;a href=\"2008%20Summer%20Paralympics%23Sports\"&gt;2008 Summer Paralympics#Sports&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedalists.\nThe following American athletes won medals at the games; all dates are for September 2008.

The highest placed finishers were &lt;a href=\"Lindsey%20Carmichael\"&gt;Lindsey Carmichael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Fabry\"&gt;Jeff Fabry&lt;/a&gt;, who each won a bronze medal. &lt;a href=\"T.%20J.%20Pemberton\"&gt;T. J. Pemberton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Bailey%20%28archer%29\"&gt;Joe Bailey&lt;/a&gt; competed against each other in the quarterfinals of the men's individual compound open, with Pemberton winning and going on to finish fourth in that event.\nTrack and field (athletics).\nThe American track and field team consisted of 26 men and 17 women.

The team set six world records and won a total of nine gold, fourteen silver, and five bronze medals, two more medals than the team won in Athens. &lt;a href=\"Jessica%20Galli\"&gt;Jessica Galli&lt;/a&gt; won five medals, more than any other team member, while &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20McGrory\"&gt;Amanda McGrory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tatyana%20McFadden\"&gt;Tatyana McFadden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bob%20Bizzell\"&gt;Jim Bob Bizzell&lt;/a&gt; each won at least three medals. &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Campbell\"&gt;Jeremy Campbell&lt;/a&gt; was the only U.S. track and field athlete to win two golds.\nLegend: Q \u2013 Qualifiers for the final as decided on a basis of rank within heat; WR=World Record; PR=Paralympic Record\nLegend: Q \u2013 Qualifiers for the final as decided on a basis of rank within heat; WR=World Record; PR=Paralympic Record\nBoccia.\nThe U.S. &lt;a href=\"boccia\"&gt;boccia&lt;/a&gt; team consisted of a single competitor, &lt;a href=\"T.%20J.%20Hawker\"&gt;T.

The final roster included thirteen athletes (seven men and six women). The team entered the Games with a goal of two gold and ten medals total. They surpassed their goal, finishing with fourteen medals: five gold, five silver, and four bronze.\nTo ensure a fair event when athletes with differing disabilities compete, times achieved were sometimes modified by a percentage rate, to produce a result known as \"Factor Time\". It is this time that decided the result of the races, and is listed below. Where this differs from the actual time recorded, actual time is also listed.\nEquestrian.\nThe only equestrian events held in the Paralympic Games are in the Dressage discipline.

All of Stack's lifts were declared invalid. She faltered and missed on her first two attempts to lift 110\u00a0kg.

This was the first time rowing has appeared as a medal sport in the Paralympic Games. &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Schwanger\"&gt;Laura Schwanger&lt;/a&gt;, who has multiple sclerosis and won ten medals in track and field across three Paralympics, battled back from &lt;a href=\"breast%20cancer\"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment to win a bronze medal in women's single sculls at age 49.
