Unbeknownst to him, his voluptuous mistress Gina (&lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Fairchild\"&gt;Morgan Fairchild&lt;/a&gt;) and his arch-rival Don Francisco (&lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Whitman\"&gt;Stuart Whitman&lt;/a&gt;) have plotted a hostile takeover of the business, and Don Anthony is gunned down following a mob meeting. Lying mortally wounded in the hospital, Don Anthony directs his chief lieutenant Monk (&lt;a href=\"Irwin%20Keyes\"&gt;Irwin Keyes&lt;/a&gt;) to locate his estranged son Tony to assume the family business and carry on the Anthony name.\nUnfortunately for the family, Tony (&lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Deezen\"&gt;Eddie Deezen&lt;/a&gt;) is a wimpy nerd with no idea of the true nature of his father's business. As Monk tries to transform the milquetoast geek into a fearsome gangster, Don Francisco attempts to overthrow him through Gina's powers of seduction, while a pair of bumbling hitmen (&lt;a href=\"Brinke%20Stevens\"&gt;Brinke Stevens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20O%27Halloran\"&gt;Jack O'Halloran&lt;/a&gt;) try to bump Tony off at every turn.\nProduction.\nThe film starred Eddie Deezen who had previously worked with Fred Olen Ray on \"&lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Hills%20Vamp\"&gt;Beverly Hills Vamp&lt;/a&gt;\". \"I love Fred,\" said Deezen said the film was \"so much fun to shoot. I had a ball. Morgan Fairchild, a lovely lady.\"\nReception.\nProfessional reviews of \"Mob Boss\" were moderately negative. &lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt; gave the film a \"C-\" rating, writing \"This mostly rotten comedy from bad-movie king Fred Olen Ray (\"&lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Chainsaw%20Hookers\"&gt;Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers&lt;/a&gt;\") offers amazingly low-brow slapstick, but the cast has fun (especially Morgan Fairchild, of all people) and the liberal use of boingy sound effects makes for a few silly laughs\". &lt;a href=\"Allmovie\"&gt;Allmovie&lt;/a&gt; gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars without a written review."
