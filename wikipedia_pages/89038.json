    "text": "Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Pueraria\"&gt;Pueraria&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"P. edulis\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pueraria%20phaseoloides\"&gt;P. phaseoloides&lt;/a&gt;\") and the common name &lt;a href=\"kudzu\"&gt;kudzu&lt;/a&gt; is used for all of these &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt;s between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have ancestry from more than one of the species.\nDescription.\nIt is a seasonal climbing plant, growing high where suitable surfaces (&lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cliff\"&gt;cliff&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It is a &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; vine with tuberous roots and rope-like, dark brown stems to 20\u00a0m (65\u00a0ft) long. It grows up to 20 metres per year and can achieve a height of 30 metres. It has markedly hairy herbaceous stems.\n\"Pueraria montana\" is native to &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt;, primarily &lt;a href=\"subtropics\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"temperateness\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; regions of &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20shape\"&gt;trifoliate&lt;/a&gt; leaves composed of three &lt;a href=\"leaflet%20%28botany%29\"&gt;leaflets&lt;/a&gt;. Each leaflet is large and &lt;a href=\"oval\"&gt;ovate&lt;/a&gt; with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The species can &lt;a href=\"nitrogen%20fixation\"&gt;fix atmospheric nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, which can supply up to 95% of leaf &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; to the plant in poor soils. Along the vines are &lt;a href=\"Plant%20stem\"&gt;nodes&lt;/a&gt;, points at which stems or &lt;a href=\"tendril\"&gt;tendril&lt;/a&gt;s can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. As a &lt;a href=\"Vine\"&gt;twining vine&lt;/a&gt;, kudzu uses &lt;a href=\"Plant%20stem\"&gt;stems&lt;/a&gt; or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the kudzu vine have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are &lt;a href=\"Tuber%23Root%20tubers\"&gt;tuberous&lt;/a&gt; and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.\n Flowers are reddish-purple and yellow, fragrant, similar to pea flowers, about wide and are produced at the leaf axis in elongated &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt;s about long. The flowering period extends from July through October. The fruit is a flat hairy pod about long with three seeds.\nKudzu's primary method of reproduction is &lt;a href=\"Asexual%20reproduction\"&gt;asexual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vegetative%20reproduction\"&gt;vegetative spread (cloning)&lt;/a&gt; which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For &lt;a href=\"Plant%20reproduction%23History%20of%20sexual%20reproduction%20of%20plants\"&gt;sexual reproduction&lt;/a&gt;, kudzu is entirely dependent on pollinators.\nAlthough kudzu prefers forest regrowth and &lt;a href=\"Edge%20effect\"&gt;edge habitats&lt;/a&gt; with high sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade. These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a \u201cstructural parasite\u201d of the southern states, enveloping entire structures when untreated and often referred to as \u201cthe vine that ate the south\u201d.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Latin &lt;a href=\"Botanical%20name%23Binary%20name\"&gt;specific epithet&lt;/a&gt; \"montana\" refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\nInvasive species.\nThe natural range of \"Pueraria montana\" can be found in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indochina\"&gt;Indochina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islands\"&gt;Pacific Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and in north &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In its native habitat, it and its closely related species occur across wide areas; the species have diverged genetically due to &lt;a href=\"vicariance\"&gt;vicariance&lt;/a&gt;. Its invasiveness can be attributed to similarities between both native and newly invaded niches, effectively expanding its habitable range into areas with climates it may not be able to endure otherwise.\nLike other exotic species, the introduction to other areas is due to human actions. Seeds are spread by mammals and birds. Kudzu are plants adapted to drought. Only above ground portions are damaged by frost; thick storage roots grow as deep as 1 metre. It forms new perennial root crowns from stem nodes touching the ground.\nThe ecological requirements of the species are those of the &lt;a href=\"subtropics\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"temperateness\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; habitat areas.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, \"Pueraria montana\" grows in several places in the warm regions of &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Maggiore\"&gt;Lake Maggiore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Lugano\"&gt;Lake Lugano&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, kudzu was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Vanuatu\"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;United States Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; to serve as &lt;a href=\"Military%20camouflage\"&gt;camouflage&lt;/a&gt; for equipment. It is now a major weed there.\n\"Pueraria montana\" is also becoming a problem in &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the United States, \"Pueraria montana\" is extensively reported in the coastal states from eastern &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, North to &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, as well as inland in &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2004, Kudzu has moved farther North along the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. Of all affected states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.\nEffects on biodiversity.\nDue to the aggressive, climbing nature of \"P. montana\" it often causes shading and death of native vegetation, resulting in a &lt;a href=\"monoculture\"&gt;monoculture&lt;/a&gt; of \"P. montana.\" As \"P. montana\" spreads, it shades and crushes its competitors with its weight, eliminating everything in its path. As a result of growing over native plants and trees, it blocks their access of vital resources such as sunlight, killing off young vegetation. These result in dramatic reductions in native &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; at the local level.\nOther than the loss of biodiversity of plant species, \"P. montana\" may have a negative effect on animals. Many plant species that are suppressed by \"P. montana\" because of its uncontrolled and rapid growth negatively impacts some wildlife animals that have specific &lt;a href=\"Mutualism%20%28biology%29\"&gt;mutualisms&lt;/a&gt; or feeding relationships with these plant species. This potentially could lead to the death of certain animal species, specifically &lt;a href=\"herbivore\"&gt;herbivore&lt;/a&gt;s, that depend on some vegetation as a resource for both food and shelter. These are important factors that lead to &lt;a href=\"habitat%20destruction\"&gt;habitat destruction&lt;/a&gt; and reduction in animal biodiversity.\nImpacts of global changes.\nChanges in the global environment such as higher CO2 levels, higher temperatures, greater rates of nitrogen deposition, and greater fragmentation of natural habitats are predicted to increase the spread of \"P. montana\".\nCarbon dioxide.\nKudzu is highly responsive to increased &lt;a href=\"Carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;CO2&lt;/a&gt; levels as it results in maximal leaf expansion, increase in leaf size, and an overall 12% increase in leaf production. \u00a0In turn, the plant has higher &lt;a href=\"turgor%20pressure\"&gt;turgor pressure&lt;/a&gt; which results in the improvements in its growth potential. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, it is possible for the potential enhancement of \"P. montana\"\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Invasive%20species\"&gt;invasiveness.&lt;/a&gt;\nTemperature.\nWith &lt;a href=\"global%20warming\"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;, overnight temperatures tend to increase. Data collected in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades showed a reduction in frost days, an earlier date for the last freeze in spring, and a later date for the first freeze in fall. These favour the spread of \u00a0\"P. montana\". \u00a0\nThe northward distribution of \"P. montana\" is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures. Cold temperatures cause their leaves to be killed off and their leaf expansion to be lagged. However, with the continuous rise in global temperature, it is predicted that \"P. montana\" will rapidly spread northward as a result of the increased number of warmer days."
