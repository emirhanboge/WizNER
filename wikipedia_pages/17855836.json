    "text": "The Prague pneumatic post (Czech: Pra\u017esk\u00e1 potrubn\u00ed po\u0161ta) is the world's last preserved &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;municipal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pneumatic%20tube\"&gt;pneumatic post&lt;/a&gt; system. It is an underground system of metal tubes under the wider centre of &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, totaling about in length. The system started service in 1889 and remained in use by the government, banks and the media until it was rendered inoperative by the August &lt;a href=\"2002%20European%20floods\"&gt;2002 European floods&lt;/a&gt;.\nSold on by former owner &lt;a href=\"Telef%C3%B3nica%20O2%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Telef\u00f3nica O2 Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; after some limited attempts to make repairs, the system now belongs to businessman Zden\u011bk Dra\u017eil, who has announced plans to repair and reopen it as a working tourist attraction. As of 2012, however, it remains closed.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; pneumatic post entered public service on March 4, 1889. The first lane had been constructed as early as 1887, but at first it only served internal purposes. It ran from the main &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; in Jind\u0159i\u0161sk\u00e1 st. (next to the &lt;a href=\"Wenceslas%20Square\"&gt;Wenceslas Square&lt;/a&gt;) to the post bureau at Mal\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed square (next to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20Square\"&gt;Old Town Square&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;. (This bureau was situated in a corner house with Linhartsk\u00e1 st., belonging to the &lt;a href=\"V.%20J.%20Rott\"&gt;V. J. Rott&lt;/a&gt; company, next to a house that is called 'U Rotta' today.) The first lane was later extended as far as the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Castle\"&gt;Prague Castle&lt;/a&gt;, making it over 5\u00a0km long. Prague was the fifth city in the world to receive a pneumatic post system after &lt;a href=\"London%20Pneumatic%20Despatch%20Company\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, which was considered a major achievement for Prague.\nThe system initially was employed mainly for sending &lt;a href=\"telegraphy\"&gt;telegrams&lt;/a&gt;. Only three stations had been connected between the Prague &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and the telegraph office as of 1901.\nThe system was established for those desiring to send a document quickly. The document would be taken to the post office and rolled up into a metal capsule. The clerk would then drop the metal capsule down a hatch leading to a predestined location. After the clerk pressed a button, the capsule would be moved by compressed air along a network of tubes beneath the pavement.\nThe main growth of the network dates to the economically prosperous era of 1927\u20131932. In those years, new lanes were constructed and tens of thousands of capsules transported per month. During the [[Prague Uprising]] the pneumatic post played a role in supplying the besieged building of the [[\u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas|Czech radio]].\nIn the late 1990s, the system was used by over 20 subscribers and operating at a loss, so kept rather for prestigious reasons. The traffic weakened gradually and the 2002 floods seriously damaged it, flooding 5 of the 11 underground engine rooms.\n[[Image:ovladac\u00ed-panel.jpg|thumb|upright|Air-pump control panel, with an [[ammeter]] and a [[manometer]] set in a marble slab]]\nPipes.\nThe lanes consist of [[steel]] pipes of 65\u00a0mm [[caliber|bore]] and wall thickness of 2.5\u20133\u00a0mm. The pipes are connected with tight couplers 14\u00a0cm long to ensure perfect coaxial alignment and then welded together, ensuring air-tightness. To prevent [[stray voltage]] from causing excess [[corrosion]], ceramic [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] are inserted between the pipe segments at some places. Pipes buried underground are protected from the outside by a layer of [[fiberglass]], wound around at increased temperature and coated with hot [[asphalt]]. The pipeline is typically buried under the Prague [[sidewalk]]s 80\u2013120\u00a0cm deep. Inside buildings and in the Prague [[trunk conduit network]] the pipes simply are coated with anti-corrosive paint.\nThe minimum [[bend radius]] is 250\u00a0cm for underground pipes, but 300\u00a0cm is the most commonly used radius. Inside buildings a bend radius as low as 200\u00a0cm is allowed. The bends are made of special [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] pipes at normal temperature, using a custom-made bender.\nA signaling cable is laid along with the pipe, enabling communication with the track components.\nThe lane segments are equipped with [[dumb well]]s, where the pipeline can be opened and inspected, or a stuck capsule removed. For this purpose a heavier capsule can be sent at a pressure of up to 30 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], knocking the stuck capsule out.\nTransport capsule.\n[[Image:Pouzdra-pro-z\u00e1silky.jpg|thumb|left|A capsule for transporting packages using the Prague pneumatic post network]]\nThe system uses [[aluminium]] capsules measuring 48\u00a0mm in outer-diameter and 200\u00a0mm in length. On the rear end they are fitted with a plastic circlet, preventing [[friction]] against walls of the pipe and a soft plastic skirt, sealing air behind the capsule. The diameter of the rear circlet is 57\u00a0mm. The remaining 8 millimeters of the bore are sealed just by the skirt, allowing for excellent airtightness and low friction at the same time.\nPropulsion units.\n[[Image:strojovna-se-dmychadly.jpg|thumb|Engine room in the main post office building in Jind\u0159i\u0161sk\u00e1 St. at ]]\n[[Image:Dmychadlo-ze-30-let.jpg|thumb|Original bladed air pump from the 1930s]]\nEach lane is equipped with a dedicated propulsion unit, consisting of an [[electric motor|electrically]]-powered air [[pump]]. One pump can service at most 3 kilometers of pipeline, so it's necessary to use several pumps on longer lanes.\nThe pumps must be [[Reversing (Vehicle maneuver)|reversible]], creating either [[pressure]] or [[vacuum]]. The pumps are connected to the pipes with [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Tee|tee-fittings]]. On both sides of the tee the pipe is equipped with switches activated by a passing capsule.\nAt first the pump is set to intake mode, pulling the capsule towards the tee. Before reaching it, the capsule hits the first switch, causing the pump to start reversing. Meanwhile, the capsule reaches the tee-fitting. As it passes the tee, the pump is already fully reversed and starts to push the capsule away.\nThe older pumps were bladed, having a single [[blade]], mounted eccentrically inside a 300\u00a0mm high cylinder. More recent pumps employ a rotating [[piston]] instead.\nPackages.\nThe capsules can be loaded with packages up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter and 30\u00a0cm in length. Their weight can be up to 3\u00a0kg. Generally these were rolled-up telegrams, but any package within the set limits could be transported.\nFor obvious reasons, dangerous and [[corrosive substance]]s, which could damage the pipeline, were banned. On the other hand, the travel speed could be adjusted, allowing for transporting fragile packages.\nLanes and stations.\n[[Image:vstup-trasy.jpg|thumb|upright|Lane input hatch, where the capsules were inserted]]\nThe Prague pneumatic post network consists of five main lanes arranged in a [[Star network|star topology]], fitted with [[Railroad switch|switches]] and [[concentrator]]s, and of \"subscriber's lines\". The total length of the lanes is about 55 kilometers. Some of the most frequented segments have two pipes (one for each direction), but the majority of the lanes use a single pipe and the direction is determined by setting up the pumps to run in the desired direction. The main lanes connect the following post offices and bureaus:\nOriginally there were 16 subscriber's lines, but only 7 have been preserved to this day. A total of 24 pneumatic post stations remain today.\nThe network crosses the river [[Vltava]] in three spots making use of bridges ([[Hl\u00e1vk\u016fv most]], [[M\u00e1nes\u016fv most]], [[most Legi\u00ed]]).\nThe headquarters/switchboard.\n[[Image:hlavy-tras.jpg|thumb|left|Controllers of the five main lanes with counters, indicator lights and switch controls]]\nAll the lanes converge to the \"main post office\" in Jind\u0159i\u0161sk\u00e1 St. Here all the packages were carefully recorded and from here the network was controlled and monitored. This is also the place where the packages were forwarded from one lane to another. The capsule was picked up from a receiving pocket by a member of the staff, recorded and inserted into the inlet of another lane.\nThe current lane state was indicated by indicator lights on the lane's controller. Up to 10 packages in 30-second intervals could be sent on the same lane at once, although this was rarely used in practice.\nWhen sending capsules to switched lanes, the capsules had to be sent out in a predefined order, as the switches could only be activated before commencing the transfer. The first capsule would be diverted, after which the switch would automatically slide back to its neutral position, sending the remaining capsules in the straight direction. Therefore, the capsule that was meant to branch off had to be sent first.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Pipeline transport]]\n[[Category:Postal system]]\n[[Category:Transport in Prague|Pneumatic post]]\n[[Category:Postal history]]\n[[Category:Pneumatics]]"
