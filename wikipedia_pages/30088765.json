    "text": "SMS \"Medusa\" was a member of the ten-ship of &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s that were built for the German \"&lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Marine\"&gt;Kaiserliche Marine&lt;/a&gt;\" (Imperial Navy) in the late 1890s and early 1900s. The \"Gazelle\" class was the culmination of earlier &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt; designs, combining the best aspects of both types in what became the progenitor of all future light cruisers of the Imperial fleet. Built to be able to serve with the main German fleet and as a colonial cruiser, she was armed with a battery of ten &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt; and a top speed of . \"Medusa\" served in all three German navies\u2014the \"Kaiserliche Marine\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Reichsmarine\"&gt;Reichsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" (Navy of the Realm) of &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Germany\"&gt;Weimar Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" (War Navy) of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;\u2014over the span of over forty years.\nDuring her career in the Imperial fleet, she served in the reconnaissance unit for the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seas%20Fleet\"&gt;High Seas Fleet&lt;/a&gt; from 1903 to 1907; during this period, she took part in cruises overseas and routine training exercises. She temporarily replaced her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; as a gunnery &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; in 1908 while the latter was undergoing repairs. \"Medusa\" was herself overhauled and then placed in &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20fleet\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; until August 1914, when the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; led to her &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;recommissioning&lt;/a&gt;. She initially operated in the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt;, supporting the &lt;a href=\"flotilla\"&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt; tasked with defending the mouth of the river. She was transferred to the Baltic in late 1915 after her sister was sunk, where she served as the &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; of the Coastal Defense Division. Decommissioned again at the end of 1916, she was used as an &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20ship\"&gt;auxiliary ship&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the war.\n\"Medusa\" was among the six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;, and she was the first major warship to return to service in 1920; as a result, she served as the \"Reichmarine\"s flagship until relieved by the battleship in 1921. Her career in the early 1920s followed a similar pattern to her prewar years, being occupied with training exercises and visits to foreign ports. She was decommissioned for the last time in 1924 and subsequently used as a &lt;a href=\"barracks%20ship\"&gt;barracks ship&lt;/a&gt; until 1940, when during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery. Based outside &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;Wilhelmshaven&lt;/a&gt;, she helped to defend the port for the rest of the war, before being badly damaged in an air raid in April 1945. Her crew scuttled her on 3 May, and she was later &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; in 1948\u20131950.\nDesign.\nFollowing the construction of the &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s of the and the &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt; for the German (Imperial Navy), the Construction Department of the (Imperial Navy Office) prepared a design for a new small cruiser that combined the best attributes of both types of vessels. The designers had to design a small cruiser with armor protection that had an optimal combination of speed, armament, and stability necessary for fleet operations, along with the endurance to operate on foreign stations in the &lt;a href=\"German%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;German colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting \"Gazelle\" design provided the basis for all of the &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s built by the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; fleet to the last official designs prepared in 1914.\n\"Medusa\" was &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of forward. She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; normally and up to at &lt;a href=\"full-load%20displacement\"&gt;full combat load&lt;/a&gt;. Her propulsion system consisted of two &lt;a href=\"triple-expansion%20steam%20engine\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s. They were designed to give , for a top speed of . The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Medusa\" carried of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men.\nThe ship was armed with ten &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK L/40 guns&lt;/a&gt; in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt;, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. They were submerged in the hull on the &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was protected by an armored &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick. The &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick &lt;a href=\"gun%20shield\"&gt;gun shield&lt;/a&gt;s.\nService history.\nPre-war career.\n\"Medusa\" was ordered under the contract name \"E\" and was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"AG%20Weser\"&gt;AG Weser&lt;/a&gt; shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; on 22 January 1900. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 5 December 1900; at the launching ceremony, she was christened by Princess Augusta, the wife of &lt;a href=\"Philipp%2C%20Prince%20of%20Eulenburg\"&gt;Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was named for the earlier &lt;a href=\"screw%20corvette\"&gt;screw corvette&lt;/a&gt; . She was moved to the &lt;a href=\"Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;\"Kaiserliche Werft\"&lt;/a&gt; (Imperial Shipyard) in &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;Wilhelmshaven&lt;/a&gt; to have her armament installed. The ship was commissioned for &lt;a href=\"sea%20trials\"&gt;sea trials&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July 1901 that lasted until 11 September, after which she was decommissioned due to crew shortages. She remained in reserve for the next two years.\n\"Medusa\" was finally commissioned for active service on 1 April 1903, under the command of \"&lt;a href=\"Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Korvettenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"KK\"\u2014Corvette Captain) &lt;a href=\"William%20Kutter\"&gt;William Kutter&lt;/a&gt;, thereafter joining the reconnaissance screen for &lt;a href=\"I%20Battle%20Squadron\"&gt;I Battle Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. She took part in a cruise from May to June to Spain with the rest of the squadron that included a visit to &lt;a href=\"Vigo\"&gt;Vigo&lt;/a&gt;, Spain, from 20 to 30 May. In July, she visited &lt;a href=\"Stavanger\"&gt;Stavanger&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, during the fleet cruise in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The next year, she was present for a &lt;a href=\"naval%20review\"&gt;naval review&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kieler%20F%C3%B6rde\"&gt;Kieler F\u00f6rde&lt;/a&gt; for King &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VII\"&gt;Edward VII&lt;/a&gt; of Great Britain during his visit to Germany. This was followed by a visit of the German fleet to Britain, after which \"Medusa\" stopped in the Netherlands from 14 to 20 July 1904. In September, \"&lt;a href=\"Fregattenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Fregattenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"FK\"\u2014Frigate Captain) &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Schlieper\"&gt;Paul Schlieper&lt;/a&gt; replaced Kutter as the ship's commander. She took part in fleet maneuvers in July and August 1905 that were conducted in Norwegian waters. During the exercises, she anchored off &lt;a href=\"Uddevalla\"&gt;Uddevalla&lt;/a&gt; from 20 to 24 July. Following the maneuvers in September, \"KF\" &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schultz\"&gt;Friedrich Schultz&lt;/a&gt; relieved Schlieper as the ship's captain. The fleet repeated the visit to Norway for maneuvers in July and August 1906; that year, \"Medusa\" visited &lt;a href=\"%C3%85lesund\"&gt;\u00c5lesund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet training maneuvers held in August and September concluded with a naval review in honor of the retiring fleet commander, \"&lt;a href=\"Grossadmiral\"&gt;Grossadmiral&lt;/a&gt;\" (Grand Admiral) &lt;a href=\"Hans%20von%20Koester\"&gt;Hans von Koester&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately afterward, \"KK\" &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Starke\"&gt;Wilhelm Starke&lt;/a&gt; took command of the ship from Schultz. That year, \"Medusa\"s gunners earned the \"Schiesspreis\" (Shooting Prize) for small cruisers, awarded every year by &lt;a href=\"Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II\"&gt;Kaiser Wilhelm II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe year 1907 passed uneventfully for \"Medusa\", apart from during the annual fleet maneuvers on 7 September, when the ship suffered a machinery breakdown, forcing her to return to &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; for repairs. On 15 September, she was replaced in the scout unit by the new cruiser . Four days later, \"Medusa\" in turn replaced her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; as the gunnery &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; for automatic weapons in the Naval Artillery Inspectorate. At that time, \"KK\" &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Trendtel\"&gt;Heinrich Trendtel&lt;/a&gt; replaced Starke as the ship's commander, though he remained aboard for just four months, being replaced in January 1908 by \"KK\" Jantzen. She served in this capacity for eight months during \"Nymphe\"s overhaul, thereafter being decommissioned on 23 May 1908 when her sister returned to service. \"Medusa\" was then overhauled and placed in reserve, where she remained for the next six years.\nWorld War I.\nFollowing the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in July 1914, \"Medusa\" was recommissioned on 4 August, under the command of \"FK\" &lt;a href=\"Erich%20von%20Zeppelin\"&gt;Erich von Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;. She was tasked with supporting the coastal patrol in the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; on 11 August, where she remained through 13 September 1915. During this period, she patrolled the area and monitored shipping entering the Elbe without incident. The ship was transferred to Wilhelmshaven on 14 September, where her crew was reduced five days later. She was not decommissioned, however, and over the course of 30 November \u2013 1 December, her crew was replenished and she was ordered to replace her sister , which had been torpedoed and sunk in the western &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. There, she joined the Coastal Defense Division. She arrived in &lt;a href=\"Warnem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Warnem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt; on 26 December and began her patrol duties, which she performed for the next year. During this period, she also served as a &lt;a href=\"target%20ship\"&gt;target ship&lt;/a&gt; to train &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt; crews. She was the &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Vizeadmiral\"&gt;Vizeadmiral&lt;/a&gt;\" (Vice Admiral) &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Mischke\"&gt;Robert Mischke&lt;/a&gt; from February to December 1916.\n\"Medusa\" took Mischke on a tour of the central Baltic, cruising from &lt;a href=\"Swinem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Swinem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt; on 31 October 1916, then to &lt;a href=\"Liep%C4%81ja\"&gt;Libau&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Klaip%C4%97da\"&gt;Memel&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Swinem\u00fcnde on 7 November. By the end of the year, the naval command decided to withdraw \"Medusa\" from service, owing to her obsolescence in the face of modern weapons and to worsening crew shortages. She was accordingly decommissioned on 18 December in Kiel and then transferred to &lt;a href=\"Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt;. There, she was used as an &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20ship\"&gt;auxiliary ship&lt;/a&gt; for the old ironclad , which was being used as a training ship for naval cadets. Four of her guns were removed in 1917. \"Medusa\" served in that capacity for the remainder of the war, which ended on 11 November 1918.\n\"Reichsmarine\" and \"Kriegsmarine\" career.\n\"Medusa\" was among the six light cruises Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; that ended the war. The postwar \"&lt;a href=\"Reichsmarine\"&gt;Reichsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" was obligated by the treaty to clear the minefields that had been laid in the North Sea during the war, and the command initially planned to convert \"Medusa\" into a mother ship for the planned 12th Minesweeper Half-Flotilla, but the unit was not created and \"Medusa\" therefore was not converted. Instead, she was recommissioned on 17 July 1920 with \"FK\" &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Werth%20%28Admiral%29\"&gt;Alexander Werth&lt;/a&gt; as her captain, the first major warship to be commissioned in the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, she was assigned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Marinestation%20der%20Ostsee\"&gt;Marinestation der Ostsee&lt;/a&gt;\" (Baltic Sea Naval Station), which also included two torpedo boat &lt;a href=\"flotilla\"&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"survey%20ship\"&gt;survey ship&lt;/a&gt; . One of her first activities was to carry &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Germany%20%281919%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Ebert\"&gt;Friedrich Ebert&lt;/a&gt; on a trip to &lt;a href=\"East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. She later visited foreign ports between 30 August and 5 September, including &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A5r%C3%B6sund\"&gt;F\u00e5r\u00f6sund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visby\"&gt;Visby&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gotland\"&gt;Gotland&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden.\nOn 10 February 1921, the battleship was recommissioned, and at the same time relieved \"Medusa\" as the flagship. The two ships, along with both torpedo boat flotillas, conducted training exercises in June and July in the western Baltic. \"Medusa\" then made another series of visits to ports in the Baltic between 28 July and 2 August, including Uddevalla and &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden. She operated as an &lt;a href=\"icebreaker\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Riga\"&gt;Gulf of Riga&lt;/a&gt; from 24 January to 12 February 1922, and during this period she visited &lt;a href=\"Windau\"&gt;Windau&lt;/a&gt;, Latvia from 2 to 9 February. She next visited &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A4vle\"&gt;G\u00e4vle&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden from 22 to 26 June, followed by ports in Finland between 29 June and 3 July. In September, \"KK\" &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Meusel\"&gt;Ernst Meusel&lt;/a&gt; replaced Werth as the ship's captain; he was to be the vessel's last commanding officer. \"Medusa\" returned to Gothenburg from 11 to 15 July 1923 along with I Half-Flotilla, followed by stops in &lt;a href=\"Molde\"&gt;Molde&lt;/a&gt; on 19 July and then &lt;a href=\"%C3%85ndalsnes\"&gt;\u00c5ndalsnes&lt;/a&gt;, both in Norway. In October, the \"Marinestation\" was reorganized, since by this time enough battleships had been recommissioned to create a separate Battleship Division; \"Medusa\" became part of the light naval forces unit. From 5 to 12 July 1924, she visited G\u00e4vle again and on 26 September, she was decommissioned.\nFrom 1 February 1928, \"Medusa\" began to serve as a &lt;a href=\"barracks%20ship\"&gt;barracks ship&lt;/a&gt; for torpedo boat and &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; crews in Wilhelmshaven. On 29 March 1929, she was stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1940, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, \"Medusa\" was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery at the &lt;a href=\"Rickmers%20Reederei\"&gt;Rickmers Reederei&lt;/a&gt; shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Bremerhaven\"&gt;Bremerhaven&lt;/a&gt;. Her armament at that point consisted of one &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20C/32%20naval%20gun\"&gt;10.5 cm SK C/32 gun&lt;/a&gt;, four &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20FlaK%2038\"&gt;10.5 cm SK C/33 guns&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20SK%20C/30\"&gt;SK C/30 guns&lt;/a&gt;, and four &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20Flak%2030/38/Flakvierling\"&gt;Flak guns&lt;/a&gt;. She was then assigned to Naval Anti-aircraft Group 222, and remained in the harbor at Wilhelmshaven, anchored off &lt;a href=\"Varel\"&gt;Varel&lt;/a&gt;, beginning on 13 August 1940. She remained there for the duration of the war. On 19 April 1945, she was badly damaged by an &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; air attack that killed twenty-three and wounded forty-one of her crew. Her remaining crew &lt;a href=\"scuttling\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; the ship on 3 May, days before the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe\"&gt;end of the war in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. British occupation troops found the wreck lying next to the . The wreck was ultimately salvaged in 1948\u20131950 and broken up for scrap."
