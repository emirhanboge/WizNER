    "text": "Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth (, born 24 January 1948) is a Hungarian &lt;a href=\"economist\"&gt;economist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt;, who served as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Prime Minister of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; from 24 November 1988 to 23 May 1990. He was one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, Hungary's &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, in the tumultuous years that led to the collapse of communism in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;. He was the last Communist Prime Minister of Hungary.\nEarly life.\nN\u00e9meth was born into a poor Catholic peasant family on 24 January 1948 in &lt;a href=\"Monok\"&gt;Monok&lt;/a&gt;, the birthplace of the revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20Kossuth\"&gt;Lajos Kossuth&lt;/a&gt;. He was of &lt;a href=\"Germans%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Swabian&lt;/a&gt; origin on his maternal side, the Stajzs had been resettled by the aristocrat &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1rolyi\"&gt;K\u00e1rolyi&lt;/a&gt; family in the 18th century. N\u00e9meth's grandfather was &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labor%20of%20Hungarians%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;deported&lt;/a&gt; from Monok to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in Autumn, 1944, and only in 1951 was he able to return home. His father Andr\u00e1s N\u00e9meth, a devout Catholic, fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Voronezh%20%281942%29\"&gt;Battle of Voronezh&lt;/a&gt; and survived &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Little%20Saturn\"&gt;the disaster&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Don River&lt;/a&gt; in early 1943. He returned to Hungary in 1946. That kind of dual identity was present in N\u00e9meth's political life, since he had a Christian family background behind his Communist party career. For instance, when he married Erzs\u00e9bet Szil\u00e1gyi in 1971, they also had a church wedding after their &lt;a href=\"civil%20marriage\"&gt;civil marriage&lt;/a&gt;. N\u00e9meth was 8 years old during the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956\"&gt;Hungarian Revolution of 1956&lt;/a&gt;. He had just isolated experiences about those events; his parents listened to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Free%20Europe/Radio%20Liberty\"&gt;Radio Free Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;1848&lt;/a&gt; flags were erected in the main square of the village, and the local party secretary was arrested and freedom fighters forced him to recite &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Prayer\"&gt;Lord's Prayer&lt;/a&gt;. N\u00e9meth could not have known the whole truth of the events due to state propaganda and concealment until his studies in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing elementary school in &lt;a href=\"Szerencs\"&gt;Szerencs&lt;/a&gt;, in 1962 N\u00e9meth attended &lt;a href=\"Berzeviczy%20Gergely%20School%20of%20Trade%20and%20Catering\"&gt;Berzeviczy Gergely School of Trade and Catering&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Miskolc\"&gt;Miskolc&lt;/a&gt;, where theologian and historian G\u00e1bor De\u00e1k was one of his teachers. He took his final exam in 1966, after that he was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx%20University%20of%20Economics\"&gt;Karl Marx University of Economics&lt;/a&gt;. Uniquely in the academic system of the communist era, the university had a certain degree of autonomy due to the powerful and influential rector K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Szab\u00f3, who had participated in the preparation and production of a major economic reform, called the &lt;a href=\"New%20Economic%20Mechanism\"&gt;New Economic Mechanism&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, which introduced some market and capitalist elements to the Hungarian economic system. Under this reformist leadership, a new economist intelligentsia emerged, instead of &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Marxism\"&gt;Orthodox Marxist&lt;/a&gt; experts, which were already acquainted with the Western mainstream curriculum and they had the opportunity to study abroad.\nN\u00e9meth graduated in 1971, after that he became an assistant lecturer, later a full-time university professor. N\u00e9meth won a scholarship of &lt;a href=\"International%20Research%20%26amp%3B%20Exchanges%20Board\"&gt;International Research &amp; Exchanges Board&lt;/a&gt; to the United States for the 1975/76 semesters, where he subsequently attended &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;. He learned &lt;a href=\"decision%20theory\"&gt;decision theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cost%E2%80%93benefit%20analysis\"&gt;cost\u2013benefit analysis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"business%20law\"&gt;business law&lt;/a&gt;. N\u00e9meth later was accused by hard-line communist leaders who said that the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) had recruited him during his Harvard year, however he called these charges \"nonsensical\".\nEarly career.\nReturning home, N\u00e9meth left the University of Economics and worked for the National Planning Office (OT) from 1977. He also joined the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (MSZMP) during this time. He was a theoretical researcher until 1978, when he was transferred to the office's Economics Department. There his role was preparation of shortened plan documents on industrial, agrarian, social etc. surveys, drafts which were dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20Hungarian%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;. According to N\u00e9meth, he then became familiar with the economic reality and the true extent of the huge &lt;a href=\"public%20debt\"&gt;public debt&lt;/a&gt;. The Communist regime and the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20National%20Bank\"&gt;Hungarian National Bank&lt;/a&gt; led a double bookkeeping, even the majority of the party's Political Committee had no information on the real data. N\u00e9meth began working for the Socialist Workers' Party Economic Department in 1981. He and &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Bartha\"&gt;Ferenc Bartha&lt;/a&gt; negotiated with Alan Whittome and &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20de%20Larosi%C3%A8re\"&gt;Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, representatives of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) in 1982, but N\u00e9meth also took part in a conference to resort to loans from &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the Soviets.\nN\u00e9meth was appointed Head of Economic Department in 1986, when &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; became leader of the Soviet Union. N\u00e9meth, who knew the new Secretary-General earlier, anticipated that a new period would go with social, political, and economic reforms. N\u00e9meth was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; as Secretary in charge of Economic Policy in June 1987. In May 1988, he was elevated to the &lt;a href=\"Politburo\"&gt;Politburo&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, long-time Secretary-General &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20K%C3%A1d%C3%A1r\"&gt;J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1roly%20Gr%C3%B3sz\"&gt;K\u00e1roly Gr\u00f3sz&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to establish a \"technocratic\" government and commissioned N\u00e9meth to negotiate with &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Bank\"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt; aimed at getting a one billion &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Mark\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; loan.\nPrime Minister of Hungary.\nIn the summer of 1988, Secretary-General Gr\u00f3sz announced his intention to resign from his position as Prime Minister to focus entirely on the organization of the party. Unlike the previous practice, he nominated four candidates, &lt;a href=\"Rezs%C5%91%20Nyers\"&gt;Rezs\u0151 Nyers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imre%20Pozsgay\"&gt;Imre Pozsgay&lt;/a&gt;, Ilona Tatai and P\u00e1l Iv\u00e1nyi to the post to discuss with local party committees, trade unions and the Patriotic People\u2019s Front. As Gr\u00f3sz was aware of the disastrous economic situation and impending insolvency, N\u00e9meth was also nominated for the position because he had established a reputation of being an economic expert. Finally the elderly Nyers withdrew himself from candidature in favor of N\u00e9meth. He took the oath on 24 November 1988, at the time he was the world's youngest head of government until the election of &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistani Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benazir%20Bhutto\"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; in December 1988.\nN\u00e9meth became Prime Minister from a relatively low position as he had never held any ministerial or state secretary posts in the previous governments. He also \"inherited\" some influential ministers from the Gr\u00f3sz Cabinet (i.e. Frigyes Berecz and &lt;a href=\"Istv%C3%A1n%20Horv%C3%A1th\"&gt;Istv\u00e1n Horv\u00e1th&lt;/a&gt;), which led to the presumption within the party that N\u00e9meth was Gr\u00f3sz's sidekick in those months. As there had not yet been created a budget for the next year, the system was not sustainable without budget cuts, according to N\u00e9meth, Gr\u00f3sz's goal was to make his Prime Minister a &lt;a href=\"scapegoat\"&gt;scapegoat&lt;/a&gt;, protecting his power and the communist ideology. Conflicts between hard-line and reformist wings widened when Gr\u00f3sz gave a speech in the &lt;a href=\"Budapest%20Sportcsarnok\"&gt;Budapest Sportcsarnok&lt;/a&gt; in which he made mention of the sharpening of the &lt;a href=\"class%20struggle\"&gt;class struggle&lt;/a&gt; and hinted at the possibility of the looming threat of &lt;a href=\"White%20Terror%20%28Hungary%29\"&gt;the White terror&lt;/a&gt;'s return to Hungary. N\u00e9meth gradually decoupled himself from the party leadership. Gr\u00f3sz, who had no idea that his successor would be self-propelled, even bugged N\u00e9meth's telephone and the latter's staff later found &lt;a href=\"covert%20listening%20device\"&gt;covert listening device&lt;/a&gt;s in the Prime Minister's residence. Over the coming months the hard-line wing got permanently weakened; the Political Committee and the Patriotic People's Front renounced their right to nominate candidates for ministerial positions; and by 10 May 1989, N\u00e9meth managed to completely revamp the composition of his cabinet. He transformed the cabinet into a \"government of experts\" whose members were destined to make the transition from one-party dictatorship to democracy. Reformists &lt;a href=\"Gyula%20Horn\"&gt;Gyula Horn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%A9kesi\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9kesi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Csaba%20H%C3%BCtter\"&gt;Csaba H\u00fctter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Glatz\"&gt;Ferenc Glatz&lt;/a&gt; and Ferenc Horv\u00e1th became members of the cabinet then. After that the N\u00e9meth government was placed under the authority of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28Hungary%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; instead of the Socialist Workers' Party.\nTransition to democracy.\nAfter being promoted to Prime Minister in November 1988, N\u00e9meth made the controversial decision to let &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;the East Germans&lt;/a&gt;, long held captive by their country's communist regime, pass through Hungary to make their way into &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;. This decision is widely regarded as a contributing factor to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; on 9 November, 1989. He became Hungary's first post-Communist Prime Minister after the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, on 7 October, 1989, a left of centre social democratic party - of which N\u00e9meth was a founding member. Following the passing of constitutional amendments by parliament on 23 October 1989 that removed the Constitution's Communist character, N\u00e9meth became the first (provisional) Prime Minister of the Third Hungarian Republic, and the new leader of Hungary as such.\nAfter premiership.\nHe left office on 23 May 1990, after suffering defeat by &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Antall\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Antall&lt;/a&gt; in Hungary's &lt;a href=\"1990%20Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;first free elections&lt;/a&gt; following the fall of Communism. He was an independent MP for &lt;a href=\"Szerencs\"&gt;Szerencs&lt;/a&gt; until April 1991. N\u00e9meth subsequently served as Vice President of the London-based &lt;a href=\"European%20Bank%20for%20Reconstruction%20and%20Development\"&gt;European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&lt;/a&gt;, the financial institution established by the international community to assist the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in their transition to democratic market economies. In 2000, he left the EBRD to return to Hungary. He attempted to become the PM-designate of the opposition &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;socialist party&lt;/a&gt;, but was unsuccessful, as &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9ter%20Medgyessy\"&gt;P\u00e9ter Medgyessy&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to that role. Medgyessy later became &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993, N\u00e9meth also received an Honorary Doctorate from &lt;a href=\"Heriot-Watt%20University\"&gt;Heriot-Watt University&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007, N\u00e9meth was commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;UN Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Ki-moon\"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the illegal use of bounty by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme\"&gt;United Nations Development Programme&lt;/a&gt; (UNDP) to &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this, the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; had informed Administrator &lt;a href=\"Kemal%20Dervi%C5%9F\"&gt;Kemal Dervi\u015f&lt;/a&gt; that the North Korean regime counterfeited and reprinted sent banknotes, which was part of their food aid. N\u00e9meth led the three-member inquiry committee which determined the existence of this unauthorized use of funds, and distribution branches in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2008, the 380-page report was published.\nFor his role in the unification of Germany and Europe, in June 2014 N\u00e9meth received the Point Alpha Prize. N\u00e9meth also participated in the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, alongside &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt; and German politicians. In an interview, N\u00e9meth said that the demolition of the Berlin Wall happened all of a sudden, but momentum had been building for months that led up to the event, as in March 1989 Gorbachev had promised that the Soviets would not act violently after the opening of the Hungarian border with Austria."
