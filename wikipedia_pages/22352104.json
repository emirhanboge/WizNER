    "text": "Ragnagard is 2D &lt;a href=\"arcade%20game\"&gt;arcade fighting game&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"System%20Vision\"&gt;System Vision&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"Saurus%20%28company%29\"&gt;Saurus&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Geo%20%28system%29\"&gt;Neo Geo&lt;/a&gt; arcade, &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Geo%20CD\"&gt;Neo Geo CD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Saturn\"&gt;Sega Saturn&lt;/a&gt;. The game's characters are all based on &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt; deities.\nGameplay.\n\"Ragnagard\" is a fighting game using &lt;a href=\"pre-rendered\"&gt;pre-rendered&lt;/a&gt; sprites similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Rare%20%28company%29\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Killer%20Instinct%20%281994%20video%20game%29\"&gt;Killer Instinct&lt;/a&gt;\" but with different gameplay mechanics. The game features an Aerial Battle System which is done by pushing up on the joystick and both of the weak punch and weak kick buttons together, allowing for air combos and air dashing. Players can also charge up the power gauge (based on four elements of Water, Wind, Fire, and Thunder, though each character only uses two of the four elements) which allows for Desperation Moves to be performed. Super Desperation Moves can be performed only if the player's life is flashing red, similar to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%20of%20Fighters\"&gt;The King of Fighters&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nPorts and related releases.\n\"Ragnagard\" was later ported to the Neo-Geo AES, the home console version of the Neo-Geo MVS. This version features limited continues and different difficulty settings. This version was later re-released through the &lt;a href=\"Wii\"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Console\"&gt;Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt; exclusively in Japan. \"Ragnagard\" was also ported to the &lt;a href=\"Neo-Geo%20CD\"&gt;Neo-Geo CD&lt;/a&gt; exclusively in Japan; this version features an improved intro, slightly cleaner &lt;a href=\"background%20music\"&gt;background music&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other tweaks. This version of \"Ragnagard\" was later ported to the &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Saturn\"&gt;Sega Saturn&lt;/a&gt;, also exclusively in Japan. This version features a few new modes and control customization, while some of the game's graphics and gameplay were improved and altered. Unlike the arcade and Neo-Geo version, in which the player could play as one of the bosses by entering a cheat code, the Neo-Geo CD and Sega Saturn versions allowed the player to play as the bosses only by entering the versus mode.\nReception.\n\"Ragnagard\" received generally mixed reception from critics since its release in arcades and other platforms.\n\"&lt;a href=\"AllGame\"&gt;AllGame&lt;/a&gt;\"s Kyle Knight felt mixed in regard to the pre-rendered visual presentation and audio design but criticized balance issue with characters and gameplay. \"&lt;a href=\"Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly\"&gt;Electronic Gaming Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\"s four reviewers gave the Neo Geo AES version a 4.675 out of 10. Crispin Boyer had a subdued reaction, but the other three panned the game. Shawn Smith and Ken Williams found it boring due to the characters' choppy movements and the lag time between each move, and Dan Hsu and Williams remarked that while the pre-fight animations are impressive, the graphics are undistinguished once the fight starts. \"MAN!AC\"s Robert Bannert commended the character designs but felt overall mixed about \"Ragnagard\" when reviewing the Saturn conversion in regards to several design aspects. \"Player One\"s Christophe Delpierre compared the visual style of the game with \"&lt;a href=\"Killer%20Instinct%20%281994%20video%20game%29\"&gt;Killer Instinct&lt;/a&gt;\"."
