    "text": "Kevin Drum (born October 19, 1958) is an American journalist. Drum initially rose to prominence through the popularity of his independent blog \"Calpundit\" (2003\u20132004). He later was invited to launch a blog, \"Political Animal\" (2004\u20132008), for the \"&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Monthly\"&gt;Washington Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2008, he took a writing and blogging position at \"&lt;a href=\"Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine.\nDrum is politically &lt;a href=\"liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;, and is known for the quality of his statistical and graphical analysis. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Long Beach, California&lt;/a&gt; and currently lives in &lt;a href=\"Irvine%2C%20California\"&gt;Irvine, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nDrum graduated from &lt;a href=\"Pacifica%20High%20School%20%28Garden%20Grove%2C%20California%29\"&gt;Pacifica High School&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Garden%20Grove%2C%20California\"&gt;Garden Grove, California&lt;/a&gt;, then attended &lt;a href=\"California%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Caltech&lt;/a&gt; for two years before transferring to &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20University%2C%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;California State University, Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;, where he received his bachelor's degree in journalism in 1981. While at CSULB he served as city editor of the university's student run newspaper, \"The\" \"Daily 49er\".\nCareer.\nTechnology.\nAfter graduating from college, Drum worked at &lt;a href=\"RadioShack\"&gt;RadioShack&lt;/a&gt; for several years, becoming a store manager in &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Mesa%2C%20California\"&gt;Costa Mesa, California&lt;/a&gt;, in 1983. He subsequently got a technical-writing job with a local technology company, becoming a product manager at &lt;a href=\"Emulex\"&gt;Emulex&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992 he began working at &lt;a href=\"Kofax\"&gt;Kofax&lt;/a&gt; Image Products, an &lt;a href=\"Irvine%2C%20California\"&gt;Irvine, California&lt;/a&gt;-based supplier of application software and image processing products. In 2000 he was promoted from the position of VP for Marketing, becoming the general manager of the Ascent Software Business Unit within Kofax. In 2001 he moved to newly created position with Dicom New Ventures, the business development arm of the Dicom Group, Kofax's parent company. He quit in 2002 to become a marketing consultant; he gave that up in 2004 to concentrate full-time on writing.\nBlogging.\nDrum's blogging started in 2003, with his independent blog, \"Calpundit.\" The \"Washington Monthly\", which wanted a blog, hired Drum in 2004 to launch \"Political Animal\".\nDrum's blogging is known for offering original statistical and graphical analysis, with special attention to &lt;a href=\"oil%20supply\"&gt;oil supply&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"Hubbert%20peak%20theory\"&gt;peak oil theory&lt;/a&gt; and related issues. His posts on education often spark discussion. He is skeptical about flavor-of-the-month school reforms which \"disappear within a few years to be replaced by some new silver bullet \u2013 and always without producing any scalable, practical, long-lasting results,\" while he favors increased spending on intensive, early intervention. At \"Calpundit\", he is credited with pioneering the trend of \"&lt;a href=\"Catblogging\"&gt;Friday catblogging&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDrum defended &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton\"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; during her &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton%20email%20controversy\"&gt;email controversy&lt;/a&gt;, stating that her actions were \"non-scandalous\" and that she is \"honest to a fault when discussing policy.\"\nThe Iraq war.\nDrum supported the 2003 &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; in its early stages, but just before the United States launched its attack, he changed his mind. He said, \"Before the war started I switched to opposition on practical grounds (i.e., that &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s approach was incapable of accomplishing the goals it was meant to accomplish). Since then, I've pretty much come to the conclusion that, in fact, I should have opposed it all along on philosophical grounds: namely that it was a fundamentally flawed concept and had no chance of working even if it had been competently executed.\"\nLead and crime.\nDrum has published a series of provocative blogs with evidence that suggests a &lt;a href=\"Lead%E2%80%93crime%20hypothesis\"&gt;link between crime and environmental lead&lt;/a&gt;, including the link between the decline in US crime rates and the phaseout of leaded gasoline. The theory was popularized by public health researcher Jessica Reyes and economist &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Nevin\"&gt;Rick Nevin&lt;/a&gt;; Drum's thesis was criticized by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Manzi%20%28software%20entrepreneur%29\"&gt;Jim Manzi&lt;/a&gt; in January 2013; Drum has continued to document new evidence in support of the theory.\nHomelessness.\nIn a 2017 blog post for \"Mother Jones\" discussing then-recently published research on public perceptions of the homeless, Drum stated:The researchers solved their conundrum by suggesting that most people are disgusted by the homeless. No kidding. About half the homeless suffer from a mental illness and a third abuse either alcohol or drugs. You\u2019d be crazy not to have a reflexive disgust of a population like that.Stephen Piston, one of the authors of the research, objected that Drum\u2019s article had \u201cprofoundly misinterpreted\u201d their research, saying:We argue that media coverage of homeless people often portrays them as unclean or diseased, which activates disgust among the general public. But [Drum] cites our research as proof that homeless people are inherently disgusting \u2014 which perpetuates the very problem in journalism our research was trying to solve.\nPersonal.\nIn an interview with &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Geras\"&gt;Norman Geras&lt;/a&gt;, Drum said that his intellectual heroes were &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin Delano Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Maynard%20Keynes\"&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20R.%20Murrow\"&gt;Edward R. Murrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin\"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;. He also considers &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt; his all-time favorite political hero.\nDrum married in 1993; he and his wife Marian have no children.\nOn October 24, 2014, Drum posted that he was undergoing treatment for &lt;a href=\"multiple%20myeloma\"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;. On October 18, 2016, he updated readers that it had been two years since his diagnosis and he was \"still alive and kicking.\" In August 2018 he reported that his multiple myeloma remained well under control."
