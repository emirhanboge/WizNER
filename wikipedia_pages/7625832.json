    "text": "Policarpa Salavarrieta (c. 26 January 1795 \u2013 14 November 1817), also known as La Pola, was a &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20people\"&gt;Neogranadine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"seamstress\"&gt;seamstress&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spied&lt;/a&gt; for the Revolutionary Forces during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reconquista%20%28Spanish%20America%29\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Granada\"&gt;Viceroyalty of New Granada&lt;/a&gt;. She was captured by Spanish &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt;s and ultimately executed for &lt;a href=\"high%20treason\"&gt;high treason&lt;/a&gt;. The Day of the Colombian Woman is commemorated on the anniversary of her death. She is now considered a &lt;a href=\"heroine\"&gt;heroine&lt;/a&gt; of the independence of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nBecause her &lt;a href=\"birth%20certificate\"&gt;birth certificate&lt;/a&gt; was never found, her legal &lt;a href=\"given%20name\"&gt;given name&lt;/a&gt; is unknown. The name Salavarrieta is known only by the names her family and friends used. Her father referred to her as Apolonia in his &lt;a href=\"will%20%28law%29\"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt;, which Salvador Contreras, the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; who formalized the testament on 13 December 1802, confirmed. She was closest to her brother, Viviano, as she became his de facto guardian when her parents died. When the armed forces in Guaduas started looking for her, she began calling herself Policarpa.\nIn her 1817 forged &lt;a href=\"passport\"&gt;passport&lt;/a&gt;, used to get in and out of &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista%20%28Spanish%20America%29\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt;, she appeared as \"Gregoria Apolinaria.\" &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Ricaurte%20de%20Lozano\"&gt;Andrea Ricaurte de Lozano&lt;/a&gt;, whom Policarpa lived with, and officially worked for in &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Ambrosio Almeyda, a &lt;a href=\"guerrilla\"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; leader to whom she supplied information, also called her by that name. Her contemporaries referred to her simply as \"La Pola,\" but Policarpa Salavarrieta is the name by which she is remembered and commemorated.\nPlace and date of birth.\nLa Pola's &lt;a href=\"date%20of%20birth\"&gt;date&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"birthplace\"&gt;place of birth&lt;/a&gt; are also subject to conjecture in the absence of legal documents. The popular version is that she was born in the &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Guaduas\"&gt;Guaduas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cundinamarca%20State\"&gt;Cundinamarca&lt;/a&gt;, between 1790 and 1796. However &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Pombo\"&gt;Rafael Pombo&lt;/a&gt; affirmed that she had been born in &lt;a href=\"Mariquita%2C%20Tolima\"&gt;Mariquita&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Caicedo%20Rojas\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Caicedo Rojas&lt;/a&gt; confirmed it as &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer date and place of birth can be surmised from information available about her siblings which, curiously enough, were not lost.\nHer siblings were:\nJudging by these family records and the fact that Policarpa was born between her two religious brothers, she would appear to have been born between 1791 and 1796. The records also seem to indicate that the Salavarrieta family lived in Guaduas and moved to &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; after Manuel was born in 1796.\nIn an attempt to reconcile the discrepancies the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Academy%20of%20History\"&gt;Colombian Academy of History&lt;/a&gt; gave its final ruling on September 10, 1991, in favour of &lt;a href=\"Guaduas\"&gt;Guaduas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cundinamarca%20State\"&gt;Cundinamarca&lt;/a&gt;, as Policarpa's birthplace.\nEarly years.\nWithout being titled or of the &lt;a href=\"Hidalgo%20%28Spanish%20nobility%29\"&gt;hidalgo&lt;/a&gt; class, Policarpa's family were apparently respectable and well-off, judging by her childhood home in &lt;a href=\"Guaduas\"&gt;Guaduas&lt;/a&gt;, now a museum. The Salavarrieta R\u00edos family moved to &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; between 1796\u20131798, living in a small house in the Santa B\u00e1rbara. \nIn 1802 a &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"epidemic\"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; broke out in the capital, killing thousands, including Policarpa\u2019s father, mother, brother Eduardo and sister Mar\u00eda Ignacia. After the tragedy, the family fell apart: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and Manuel joining the &lt;a href=\"Augustinians\"&gt;Augustinian&lt;/a&gt; order, Ram\u00f3n and Francisco Antonio traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tena%2C%20Ecuador\"&gt;Tena&lt;/a&gt; where they found work on a farm. Catarina, the oldest surviving child, decided to move back to Guaduas around 1804, taking her younger siblings Policarpa and Bibiano with her. They lived in the houses of their &lt;a href=\"godparent\"&gt;godmother&lt;/a&gt; Margarita Beltr\u00e1n and their aunt Manuela until Catarina married Domingo Garc\u00eda, again taking her two siblings with her.\nThere is little information about this period in Policarpa's life. What is known is that she worked as a seamstress, and is also believed to have worked as a teacher in a public school.\nAt that time Guaduas was an important rest stop on the most important road through New Granada, a stretch of land from Bogot\u00e1 to the &lt;a href=\"Magdalena%20River\"&gt;Magdalena River&lt;/a&gt; communicating with the north of the country and out to the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt;: soldiers, nobles, artisans, farmers, insurgents, Spaniards and Grenadines of all walks of life passed through Guaduas, making it both a centre of commerce and of news and information. During the war, Policarpa's family were involved on the Revolutionary side: her brother-in-law, Domingo Garc\u00eda, died fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Nari%C3%B1o\"&gt;Antonio Nari\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Campaign, in which her brother Bibiano also fought.\nAccording to legend, after the Revolution broke out, the &lt;a href=\"Viceroy\"&gt;Viceroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Amar%20y%20Borb%C3%B3n\"&gt;Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, fearing for their lives, were smuggled out of Bogot\u00e1 by the mayor &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Miguel%20Pey%20de%20Andrade\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Miguel Pey de Andrade&lt;/a&gt;. They stopped in Guaduas, where the &lt;a href=\"Vicereine\"&gt;Vicereine&lt;/a&gt;, Mar\u00eda Francisca Villanov\u00e1, is supposed to have gone to Policarpa's house and foretold her imminent destiny and death.\nRevolutionary.\nHistory indicates that Policarpa was not involved in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogot\u00e1 in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogot\u00e1 was the stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"Reconquista%20%28Spanish%20America%29\"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the population were Spanish &lt;a href=\"Royalist%20%28Spanish%20American%20Independence%29\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt;s and approved of the take over by &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Morillo\"&gt;Pablo Morillo&lt;/a&gt;, it was very difficult to get in and out of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended her and her brother stay in the house of &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Ricaurte%20y%20Lozano\"&gt;Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano&lt;/a&gt; under cover of working as her servants. In reality, Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.\nIn Guaduas, Policarpa was known as a revolutionary. Because she was not known in &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, she could move freely and meet with other patriots and spies unsuspected. She could also infiltrate the homes of the royalists. Offering her services as a seamstress to the wives and daughters of royalists and officers, Policarpa altered and mended for them and their families; at the same time, she overheard conversations, collected maps and intelligence on their plans and activities, identified who the major royalists were, and found out who were suspected of being revolutionaries.\nPolicarpa also secretly &lt;a href=\"recruitment\"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt; young men to the Revolutionary cause; with assistance from her brother. Together, they helped increase the number of soldiers the insurgency in Cundinamarca desperately needed.\nCapture.\nPolicarpa's operations ran smoothly and undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information back to the insurgents outside &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers &lt;a href=\"desertion\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in &lt;a href=\"Machet%C3%A1\"&gt;Machet\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. They had hoped their connection with La Pola could come in handy in the event of a revolt in the city. The loyalists now suspected her of treason, but lacked solid evidence to accuse a seamstress of espionage and treason.\nThe arrest of Alejo Sabara\u00edn while he was trying to escape to &lt;a href=\"Casanare%20Department\"&gt;Casanare&lt;/a&gt; was the event that allowed the royalists to arrest La Pola; he was apprehended with a list of Royalist and Patriots given to him by Policarpa.\nSergeant Iglesias, the principal &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; officer in Bogot\u00e1, was charged with finding and arresting her. Policarpa Salavarrieta and her brother Bibiano were both arrested at the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20del%20Rosario\"&gt;Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario&lt;/a&gt;, which had been turned into a makeshift prison.\nTrial and death.\nThey were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20war\"&gt;Council of war&lt;/a&gt; and on November 10, Policarpa, Alejo, and six other prisoners were sentenced to &lt;a href=\"execution%20by%20firing%20squad\"&gt;execution by firing squad&lt;/a&gt;, set for the morning of November 14, 1817.\nThe hour chosen for her execution was nine in the morning of November 14. Hands bound, La Pola marched to her death with two priests by her side and led by a guard. Instead of repeating the prayers the priests were reciting, she cursed the Spaniards and predicted their defeat in the coming Revolution. It is said that La Pola cursed the Spaniards relentlessly during the night before her execution. At one point she stopped, tired and thirsty, and one of the guards offered her a glass of wine. She tossed the glass right back at her captors, proclaiming \"I would not accept even a glass of water from my enemies!\".\nShe was to die with six other prisoners and her lover, Alejo Sabara\u00edn, in the &lt;a href=\"Bol%C3%ADvar%20Square\"&gt;Bol\u00edvar Square&lt;/a&gt;. After ascending the scaffold she was told to turn her back, as that was the way traitors were killed. As she was led to her execution, Policarpa gave heart to the other prisoners and berated her captors. La Pola, refusing to kneel to the Spanish firing squad, yelled, \"I have more than enough courage to suffer this death and a thousand more. Do not forget my example.\" When the squad began shooting, Pola turned around to face the squad.\nAs was customary, the bodies of Alejo and the other six prisoners were paraded and exhibited through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, to scare off would-be Revolutionaries. Being a woman, she was spared this final humiliation.\nHer &lt;a href=\"Augustinians\"&gt;Augustinian&lt;/a&gt; friar brothers, Jos\u00e9 Maria de Los \u00c1ngeles and Manuel Salavarrieta, claimed the body, to give her a proper &lt;a href=\"Christian%20burial\"&gt;Christian burial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"convent\"&gt;convent&lt;/a&gt; church of San Agust\u00edn, in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"La%20Candelaria\"&gt;La Candelaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommemoration.\nDay of the Colombian Woman.\nOn November 8, 1967, Law 44 was passed by the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Congress of the Republic of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and signed by &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Lleras%20Restrepo\"&gt;Carlos Lleras Restrepo&lt;/a&gt;, which declared in its 2nd Article that November 14 would be the \u201cDay of the Colombian Woman\u201d in honour of the anniversary of the death of \u201cOur heroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta\u201d.\nColombian currency.\nPolicarpa Salavarrieta has been depicted on &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Peso\"&gt;Colombian Currency&lt;/a&gt; many times over the years. While many idealized or mythological female figures have also appeared, her portrait was for a long time the only one of an actual female historical personality ever used.\nOther images include: &lt;a href=\"Marianne\"&gt;Lady Liberty&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Justice\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;; an unknown &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Colombia\"&gt;Native American woman&lt;/a&gt; representing all &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Colombia\"&gt;indigenous peoples in Colombia&lt;/a&gt;; and more recently \"&lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Mar\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;\", a fictitious character from the &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Isaacs\"&gt;Jorge Isaacs&lt;/a&gt; novel of the same name, pictured with the author. The \"Diez Mil Pesos\" bill ($10,000) is currently the only denomination with Policarpa Salavarrieta's image still in circulation.\nPostage stamps.\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the independence of Colombia in 1910, the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Government of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; issued a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;series of stamps&lt;/a&gt; that featured the images of some of the Heroes of the Independence, including Policarpa Salavarrieta, &lt;a href=\"Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar\"&gt;Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20de%20Paula%20Santander\"&gt;Francisco de Paula Santander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camilo%20Torres%20Tenorio\"&gt;Camilo Torres Tenorio&lt;/a&gt; and others. Between 1903 and 1904 the Department of &lt;a href=\"Antioquia%20Department\"&gt;Antioquia&lt;/a&gt; issued a blue 3 pesos stamp depicting La Pola (Scott catalogue, Antioquia number 154)."
