    "text": "The Best of Van Morrison Volume Two is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Van%20Morrison\"&gt;Van Morrison&lt;/a&gt; released in 1993.\nMorrison chose the tracks for this album himself. It is mostly drawn from his work during 1984\u20131991. \"&lt;a href=\"Real%20Real%20Gone\"&gt;Real Real Gone&lt;/a&gt;\" from the 1990 album \"&lt;a href=\"Enlightenment%20%28Van%20Morrison%20album%29\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;\" was the only song included that was a fairly successful single. The other songs were not well known except for among longtime fans. They were a good example of his more idiosyncratic material that had been prevalent during this period when his work was mostly about spiritual searches for fulfillment. But also included were a 1960s &lt;a href=\"Them%20%28band%29\"&gt;Them&lt;/a&gt; cover of &lt;a href=\"John%20Lee%20Hooker\"&gt;John Lee Hooker&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Look%20Back%20%28John%20Lee%20Hooker%20song%29\"&gt;Don't Look Back&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"It%27s%20All%20Over%20Now%2C%20Baby%20Blue\"&gt;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&lt;/a&gt;\" a &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Dylan\"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; cover.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by &lt;a href=\"Van%20Morrison\"&gt;Van Morrison&lt;/a&gt; except as indicated."
