    "text": "Grant City is the name of a neighborhood located on the &lt;a href=\"East%20Shore%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;East Shore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island\"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the east of Grant City lies &lt;a href=\"Midland%20Beach%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;Midland Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and a high cliff to the west of Richmond Road separates Grant City from &lt;a href=\"Todt%20Hill\"&gt;Todt Hill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"New%20Dorp%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;New Dorp&lt;/a&gt; is situated immediately south of Grant City. &lt;a href=\"Dongan%20Hills%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;Dongan Hills&lt;/a&gt; is situated to the north.\nHistory.\nOriginally known as Frenchtown, the community was renamed in honor of &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Ulysses%20S.%20Grant\"&gt;Ulysses S. Grant&lt;/a&gt; soon after the conflict began, despite the fact that the war itself was so unpopular on Staten Island that the island was the scene of anti-&lt;a href=\"Draft%20Riot%20of%201863\"&gt;draft riot&lt;/a&gt;s in July 1863. Many of the streets are named after historical figures such as Lincoln Ave (after President &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;), Fremont Ave (after General &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Fremont\"&gt;John C. Fremont&lt;/a&gt; who was the first Republican candidate for president, as well as a Staten Island resident, in 1856), Adams Avenue (after President &lt;a href=\"John%20Adams\"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt;), Colfax Ave (after Vice President &lt;a href=\"Schuyler%20Colfax\"&gt;Schuyler Colfax&lt;/a&gt;) and Greeley Ave (after newspaper editor &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Greeley\"&gt;Horace Greeley&lt;/a&gt;). Many other streets were originally named after historical figures but those streets have been renamed.\nMany small, one-family homes were built in Grant City in the 1950s, with a stronger growth spurt occurring after the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Verrazano-Narrows%20Bridge\"&gt;Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in November 1964 made access to the island from &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; much easier. Today the neighborhood's population is heavily &lt;a href=\"Italian-American\"&gt;Italian-American&lt;/a&gt; by ethnicity and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; by religion, and many of its residents were born in Brooklyn. Grant City and the neighborhoods surrounding it are also very &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; politically, with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; candidates for most elected offices.\nNotable events.\nIn August 1990 an &lt;a href=\"Fujita%20scale\"&gt;F0&lt;/a&gt; tornado made its way north along Fremont Ave. in Grant City, toppling 100-plus year old trees and causing widespread damage.\nTransportation.\nGrant City is served by the along Midland Avenue and Lincoln Avenue, the &lt;a href=\"S74%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29\"&gt;S74&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S76%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29\"&gt;S76&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S84%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29\"&gt;S84&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S86%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29\"&gt;S86&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SIM15%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29\"&gt;SIM15&lt;/a&gt; along Richmond Road, and the along Hylan Blvd. It is also served by express buses along Hylan Boulevard.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grant%20City%20station\"&gt;Grant City station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island%20Railway\"&gt;Staten Island Railway&lt;/a&gt; serves the community. The station immediately to the north is located at &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Avenue%20station\"&gt;Jefferson Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, near the boundary between Grant City and neighboring &lt;a href=\"Dongan%20Hills%2C%20Staten%20Island\"&gt;Dongan Hills&lt;/a&gt;."
