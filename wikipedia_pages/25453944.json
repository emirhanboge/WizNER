His family left Burma and migrated to &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (now Bangladesh) after the government there nationalised everything and all assets owned by the family were consequently taken away. However, after a civil war broke out in East Pakistan, Tai moved to &lt;a href=\"West%20Pakistan\"&gt;West Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 and settled in &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;. He describes his first days in Karachi as having been spent on \"looking for work\". He came across a person who happened to be a bodybuilder. Having achieved a black belt in the &lt;a href=\"Bando\"&gt;Bando&lt;/a&gt; style in Burma at the age 16, it was here where Tai's interest in martial arts sustained. Gradually, he began to teach martial arts to students at &lt;a href=\"Hill%20Park%2C%20Karachi\"&gt;Hill Park&lt;/a&gt; which improved his financial situation and also promoted his reputation.\nAs a pioneer of &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt; in Pakistan, he laid the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Karate%20Federation\"&gt;Pakistan Karate Federation&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeded in having the body affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Olympic%20Association\"&gt;Pakistan Olympic Association&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Sports%20Board\"&gt;Pakistan Sports Board&lt;/a&gt;. He serves as the Secretary General of the Pakistan Karate Federation.\nHaving received numerous awards in various continents of the world during his illustrious career, he was declared the International Grand Master of the Year in 2000 by the US International Grandmasters Council, an institution based in the United States.
