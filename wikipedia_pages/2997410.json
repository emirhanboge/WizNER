    "text": "Saviour is the title of a &lt;a href=\"comic%20book\"&gt;comic book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ongoing%20series\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Millar\"&gt;Mark Millar&lt;/a&gt; and drawn by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Vallely\"&gt;Daniel Vallely&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Kitching\"&gt;Nigel Kitching&lt;/a&gt;. It was Millar's first professionally published work.\nPublication history.\n\"Saviour\" was published by &lt;a href=\"Trident%20Comics\"&gt;Trident Comics&lt;/a&gt; from 1989 to 1990 and ran for six issues until Trident went bankrupt.\nPlot synopsis.\nThe story revolved around the second coming of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"superhero\"&gt;superhero&lt;/a&gt; who looked like popular British television personality &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Ross%20%28television%20presenter%29\"&gt;Jonathan Ross&lt;/a&gt;. This superhero, called The Saviour, has set out to change the world for the better. However The Saviour is the &lt;a href=\"antichrist\"&gt;antichrist&lt;/a&gt; and plans to take over the world with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Satanism\"&gt;satanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; devoted to him. The only thing which could stop him is the presence of the real Son of God and much of the story involves The Saviour's attempts to track his foe down. Eventually it is discovered that the foe is an angel and not the real Son of God. The Saviour kills him thinking he has won, but there is another super powered being on Earth unknown to The Saviour.\nCollected editions.\nA &lt;a href=\"trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29\"&gt;trade paperback&lt;/a&gt; collection was released, which collected the first five issues."
