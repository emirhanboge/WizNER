In the &lt;a href=\"1993%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;1993 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;, Bella memorably played the ball the wrong way after being spun around in a strong tackle. In 1994, he played in Canterbury's &lt;a href=\"1994%20NSWRL%20season%23Grand%20Final\"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; loss to the &lt;a href=\"Canberra%20Raiders\"&gt;Canberra Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, where he famously knocked the ball on from the opening kick off.
