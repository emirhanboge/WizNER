    "text": "Jelendol (; or \"Hirisgruben\", &lt;a href=\"Gottscheerish\"&gt;Gottscheerish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Hirisgru\u0259bn\") is a settlement south of &lt;a href=\"Rakitnica%2C%20Slovenia\"&gt;Rakitnica&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Municipality%20of%20Ribnica\"&gt;Municipality of Ribnica&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. The area is part of the traditional region of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Carniola\"&gt;Lower Carniola&lt;/a&gt; and is now included in the &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Slovenia%20Statistical%20Region\"&gt;Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nAccording to Snoj, names like \"&lt;a href=\"Jelendol%2C%20Tr%C5%BEi%C4%8D\"&gt;J\u00ealendol&lt;/a&gt;\", pronounced /&lt;a href=\"Latin%20epsilon\"&gt;\u025b&lt;/a&gt;\u02d0/, are ultimately derived from the Slovene common noun \"jelen\" '&lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt;', meaning 'deer hollow, deer valley', but names like \"&lt;a href=\"Jelendol%2C%20%C5%A0kocjan\"&gt;J\u00e9lendol&lt;/a&gt;\", pronounced /&lt;a href=\"Close-mid%20front%20unrounded%20vowel\"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;\u02d0/, are instead derived from *\"J\u00e9lin d\u00f4l\", literally '&lt;a href=\"Abies%20alba\"&gt;fir&lt;/a&gt; hollow, fir valley' from the Slovene common noun \"jela\" 'fir'. This toponym is one of the latter. The German name \"Hirschgruben\" and the Gottscheerish name \"Hirisgru\u0259bn\" mean 'deer hollow' (cf. German \"Hirsch\" 'deer', Gottscheerish \"hiris\" 'deer').\nHistory.\nJelendol was a &lt;a href=\"Gottscheers\"&gt;Gottschee German&lt;/a&gt; settlement. North of the village, on the slope of Strmec Hill, are the remnants of an unfinished castle that the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Auersperg\"&gt;Auersperg&lt;/a&gt; noble family had started building. The Auerspergs drew water from Cave Spring () to supply a steam-powered sawmill in the village. Jelendol was an industrial settlement in the middle of a fir and beech forest. The sawmill had a production capacity of 700 wagons of lumber per year, which was exported to Italy, Spain, and Africa. Before the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the village had three houses and a population of 48. The original residents were evicted from the area in 1941 during the Second World War and the sawmill was burned. After the war, the site consisted of two large buildings surrounded by coniferous forest. The village no longer has any permanent residents, and the buildings are occasionally used by forestry workers.\nMass grave.\nJelendol is the site of a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20graves%20in%20Slovenia\"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt; from the Second World War. The Jelendol Mass Grave () is located 9\u00a0km south of &lt;a href=\"Ribnica%2C%20Ribnica\"&gt;Ribnica&lt;/a&gt;, about west of the road between Ribnica and &lt;a href=\"Gr%C4%8Darice\"&gt;Gr\u010darice&lt;/a&gt;. It contained the remains of 119 &lt;a href=\"Anti-Communist%20Volunteer%20Militia\"&gt;anticommunist militia&lt;/a&gt; prisoners of war from the prison in Ribnica that were shot by the communist Security and Intelligence Service (VOS) in October 1943. Most of the victims were reburied at the military cemetery in &lt;a href=\"Hrova%C4%8Da\"&gt;Hrova\u010da&lt;/a&gt; on 4 October 1944."
