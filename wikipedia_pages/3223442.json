    "text": "R\u00fcdiger Abramczik (born 18 February 1956 in &lt;a href=\"Gelsenkirchen\"&gt;Gelsenkirchen&lt;/a&gt;-Erle) is a former German &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach, best known for his ability to cross the ball (\"Flankengott\").\nClub career.\nAbramczik, whose younger brother &lt;a href=\"Volker%20Abramczik\"&gt;Volker&lt;/a&gt; later became also a professional footballer for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;FC Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;, joined the ranks of the city's biggest club, Schalke 04, from native SV Erle 08 at the age of ten after former German international &lt;a href=\"Bernhard%20Klodt\"&gt;Bernhard Klodt&lt;/a&gt; spotted him. Schalke's former &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Friedel%20Rausch\"&gt;Friedel Rausch&lt;/a&gt; was partly coaching him in the youth of Schalke then, getting impressed by his unique mobility and pace. It was Rausch who warmly recommended young \"Abi\" to Schalke's manager &lt;a href=\"Ivica%20Horvath\"&gt;Ivica Horvath&lt;/a&gt;, feeling the schoolboy international (23 caps) could already do a job on the highest level.\nFor the kick-off of the 1973\u201374 Bundesliga season, FC Schalke 04 travelled to &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; to see Horvath handing him a starting role. Schalke lost, with Stuttgart's &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Ohlicher\"&gt;Hermann Ohlicher&lt;/a&gt;'s hat-trick the only goals in the game, but Abramczik's appearance on that 11 August made him the youngest ever player used on Bundesliga level at that time. Making fourteen appearances in his Bundesliga debut season, he went on to become a key player for his club in less than three years, netting ten goals for Schalke in 1976\u201377, when they finished runner-up behind &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&lt;/a&gt;. The yield of ten goals scored by the then 20-year-old Abramczik remained the best effort of a young Bundesliga player until &lt;a href=\"Lukas%20Podolski\"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt; hit ten for &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln\"&gt;1. FC K\u00f6ln&lt;/a&gt; as an eighteen-year-old in 2003\u201304.\nJoining &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;FC Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;'s bitter arch-rival &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 1979\u201380 season, Abramczik's days in Dortmund lasted until he joined &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;1. FC N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. That worked out to be a disastrous career move for the Gelsenkirchen-born, his new club was relegated from &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; with him getting suspended by the club for committing misconduct. He then showed up for &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%20team%29\"&gt;Galatasaray Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Jupp%20Derwall\"&gt;Jupp Derwall&lt;/a&gt; and had a spell with &lt;a href=\"Rot-Wei%C3%9F%20Oberhausen\"&gt;Rot-Wei\u00df Oberhausen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; before heading back to hometown club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;FC Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt; in October 1987. Coming to action in four further Bundesliga matches in the space of five weeks for them, a campaign in which Schalke was chanceless to avoid the drop to 2. Bundesliga, Abramczik decided to retire from the professional game to go on playing on amateur level for &lt;a href=\"Wormatia%20Worms\"&gt;Wormatia Worms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20G%C3%BCtersloh%202000\"&gt;FC G\u00fctersloh&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nK\u00f6ln's &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCngersdorfer%20Stadion\"&gt;M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion&lt;/a&gt; witnessed R\u00fcdiger Abramczik's Germany debut when the side of &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Sch%C3%B6n\"&gt;Helmut Sch\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (5\u20130) on 27 April 1977. Abramczik, who was forming a formidable striker duo with &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Fischer\"&gt;Klaus Fischer&lt;/a&gt; for Schalke at that time, was called up further by Sch\u00f6n and with the &lt;a href=\"1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1978 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at stage, Abramczik enjoyed his taking part in it for the defending champion. Tipped to be a delight for Germany, failing to produce greater consistency in his game appeared to be the bar to his further proceedings in \"Die Nationalmannschaft\". His life as a German international lasted for only nineteen caps in between 1977 and 1979, with a 3\u20131 win against Malta at &lt;a href=\"G%C5%BCira\"&gt;G\u017cira&lt;/a&gt; his last &lt;a href=\"international%20cap\"&gt;international cap&lt;/a&gt;, an abrupt end furthered by a voiced conflict with then DFB president &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Neuberger\"&gt;Hermann Neuberger&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nAbramczik's career in coaching was caused by his decision to work as assistant-manager of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Neururer\"&gt;Peter Neururer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken\"&gt;1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken&lt;/a&gt; when he run a dyeworks shop in &lt;a href=\"Gelsenkirchen\"&gt;Gelsenkirchen&lt;/a&gt;. A year later, Saarbr\u00fccken appointed him Neururer's successor in 1992. He managed &lt;a href=\"Antalyaspor\"&gt;Antalyaspor&lt;/a&gt; from 1999 to 2000."
