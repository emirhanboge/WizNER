    "text": "The Church House, No.1 Church Street, &lt;a href=\"Tetbury\"&gt;Tetbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire\"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;, England, is a prominent Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt; located on the corner of Church Street and Long Street. It is noted for its range of large handsome windows, porch and shop fronts to both Church Street and Long Street. Both &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt;s have a range of windows indicating its possible former use as a &lt;a href=\"Weaver%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;weaver&lt;/a&gt;'s workshop.\nHistory.\nThe property, once owned by the Feoffees, was often used as a venue for fund raising. One of these was very popular and was known as 'Church Ales', when a barrel or two of weak &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt; was provided and sold off at a party to raise money for a worthy cause.\nAround 1752 the property was sold for \u00a3250 to help pay for the rebuilding of the Parish Church of St Mary's. This came about apparently because the &lt;a href=\"leasehold%20estate\"&gt;tenant&lt;/a&gt; at the time forgot to take up his option to renew the &lt;a href=\"lease\"&gt;lease&lt;/a&gt; and occupation on the appropriate day and the Church snatched the opportunity to raise more money. The parish retained the right to hold 'Church Ales' on the ground floor of the building.\nDuring recent redevelopment of the cellar ancient, probably &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt;, remains were uncovered. The shop is now used as a clothes and fashion retail outlet."
