    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"IMOCA%2060\"&gt;IMOCA 60&lt;/a&gt; Class yacht PRB, FRA 85 was designed by Finot-Cong and launched in the 15th July 1996 after being built Chantier Nautique Pinta based in La Rochelle, France. The boat capsized during the BOC challenge and was lost although &lt;a href=\"Isabelle%20Autissier\"&gt;Isabelle Autissier&lt;/a&gt; was rescued by fellow competitor Italian G. Soldini. The boat capsized with the keel and keel bulb attached and was unable to right itself despite having a canting keel. Primarily because of the large deck area creating a very wide stable form this led to the coachroof enlarging and moor camber on the deck to make the boats less stable upsidedown and the introduction of the righting test."
