    "text": "Kenneth Ronald \"Ken\" French (born March 10, 1954) is the Roth Family Distinguished Professor of &lt;a href=\"Finance\"&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tuck%20School%20of%20Business\"&gt;Tuck School of Business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%20College\"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt;. He has previously been a &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20%28teaching%20staff%29\"&gt;faculty&lt;/a&gt; member at &lt;a href=\"MIT\"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yale%20School%20of%20Management\"&gt;Yale School of Management&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago%20Booth%20School%20of%20Business\"&gt;University of Chicago Booth School of Business&lt;/a&gt;. He is most famous for his work on &lt;a href=\"Valuation%20%28finance%29\"&gt;asset pricing&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Fama\"&gt;Eugene Fama&lt;/a&gt;. They wrote a series of papers that cast doubt on the validity of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20asset%20pricing%20model\"&gt;Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)&lt;/a&gt;, which posits that a stock's &lt;a href=\"Beta%20%28finance%29\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; alone should explain its average return. These papers describe two factors above and beyond a stock's market beta which can explain differences in stock returns: market capitalization and \"value\". They also offer evidence that a variety of patterns in average returns, often labeled as \"anomalies\" in past work, can be explained with their &lt;a href=\"Fama%E2%80%93French%20three-factor%20model\"&gt;Fama\u2013French three-factor model&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with contributing articles to major journals such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Finance\"&gt;Journal of Finance&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Financial%20Economics\"&gt;Journal of Financial Economics&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"Review of Financial Studies\", the \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Economic%20Review\"&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"Journal of Political Economy\", and the \"Journal of Business\", French is also a research associate at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research\"&gt;National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/a&gt;, an advisory editor at the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Financial%20Economics\"&gt;Journal of Financial Economics&lt;/a&gt;\", and a former associate editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Finance\"&gt;Journal of Finance&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Review of Financial Studies.\nProfessor French was the vice president of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Finance%20Association\"&gt;American Finance Association&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and was the organization's president in 2007-8. Also in 2007, Professor French was elected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (AAAS).\nHe obtained a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;B.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 1975, from &lt;a href=\"Lehigh%20University\"&gt;Lehigh University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20engineering\"&gt;mechanical engineering&lt;/a&gt;. He then earned an &lt;a href=\"M.B.A.\"&gt;M.B.A.&lt;/a&gt; in 1978, an &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Science\"&gt;M.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, and a Ph.D. in &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, all from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Rochester\"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;.
