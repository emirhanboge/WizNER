    "text": "Cornelius Jakhelln (born 31 August 1977 in &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt;), also known as Cornelius von Jackhelln, is a Norwegian vocalist, guitarist, musician, writer and poet.\nBiography.\nMusician.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; but currently residing in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, Cornelius was 18 years old when he and &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Nedland\"&gt;Lars \"Lazare\" Nedland&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"avant-garde%20metal\"&gt;avant-garde metal&lt;/a&gt; band, &lt;a href=\"Solefald\"&gt;Solefald&lt;/a&gt;. Along with being a lead vocalist, guitarist, bassist and composer in the band, he also handles the vast majority of lyric writing for the band. &lt;a href=\"Solefald\"&gt;Solefald&lt;/a&gt; has since released one demo and seven full-length albums. In December 2005, the band was nominated for the Norwegian &lt;a href=\"Alarm%20award\"&gt;Alarm award&lt;/a&gt; for best &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; album for the album, \"\".\nCornelius' first time recording with a band other than &lt;a href=\"Solefald\"&gt;Solefald&lt;/a&gt; was in July 1999, when Cornelius performed guest vocals for the &lt;a href=\"gothic%20metal\"&gt;gothic metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Monumentum\"&gt;Monumentum&lt;/a&gt; for the songs \"Black And Violet\", a cover of the Italian band &lt;a href=\"Death%20SS\"&gt;Death SS&lt;/a&gt;, and \"The Colour of Compassion\". These recordings were released in 2004 on the Monumentum compilation album, &lt;a href=\"Metastasi\"&gt;Metastasi&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2003, Jakhelln began working on a new band. The name chosen was &lt;a href=\"Sturmgeist\"&gt;Sturmgeist&lt;/a&gt;, and the band plays an experimental style of &lt;a href=\"black%20metal\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"thrash%20metal\"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; with lyrics sung in English, &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20language\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt;, and German about &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20mythology\"&gt;Germanic mythology&lt;/a&gt;, war, and recitations of &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt; poetry. On January 24, 2005, Sturmgeist released their first full-length, entitled &lt;a href=\"Meister%20Mephisto\"&gt;Meister Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; on the record label, &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Mist\"&gt;Season of Mist&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Sturmgeist has gone on a small European tour, and had recruited two more official members, John \"Panzer\" Jacobsen on guitar, and Christian \"Anti Christian\" Svendsen on drums, ending the band's time as a solo project. Sturmgeist's second full-length, entitled \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20%28album%29\"&gt;\u00dcber&lt;/a&gt;\", was released October 16, 2006 through &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Mist\"&gt;Season of Mist&lt;/a&gt;. His third album released under the Sturmgeist name was released in 2009, entitled &lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20Futurista\"&gt;Manifesto Futurista&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 26, 2005, Cornelius also announced on his official website that he would finally be recording an &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; album in &lt;a href=\"Sofia%2C%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Sofia, Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; that he had been planning for six years. He has described the project as a combination of &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"darkwave\"&gt;darkwave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drum%20and%20bass\"&gt;drum'n'bass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"black%20metal\"&gt;black metal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe album, entitled &lt;a href=\"My%20Only%20Drug%20Is%20Madness\"&gt;My Only Drug Is Madness&lt;/a&gt; was released in 2007, under the band G.U.T, meaning Grace Under Torture. He got the phrase from a &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Mann\"&gt;Thomas Mann&lt;/a&gt; short story entitled &lt;a href=\"Der%20Tod%20in%20Venedig\"&gt;Der Tod in Venedig&lt;/a&gt;.\nWriter.\nAside from being a musician, Cornelius made his debut as a writer in 2001. He has had many writings published in newspapers and magazines and a tetralogy of poems entitled &lt;a href=\"Quadra%20Natura\"&gt;Quadra Natura&lt;/a&gt; for which he was deemed the winner of a national Scandinavian novel writing contest in 2007. The third volume of this four-book collection, entitled &lt;a href=\"Fagernorn.%20Quadra%20Natura%200111\"&gt;Fagernorn. Quadra Natura 0111&lt;/a&gt; was released on March 16, 2006. He is also involved with a Paris-based literary review entitled &lt;a href=\"Avant-poste\"&gt;Avant-poste&lt;/a&gt;, which was nominated for the French CNOUS annual award, as one out of ten cultural projects. He is also writing the &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; for a contemporary opera telling a story from the &lt;a href=\"paganism\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt; times of the North.\nHe has continued to have a successful career as an author and was quoted in an interview stating \"Being a writer is my job. And my music is\u2026 It's like a \"Nebenjob\", as you would say in Germany. A passion.\"\nEducation.\nCornelius has a master's degree in philosophie/lettres modernes from &lt;a href=\"Paris-Sorbonne%20University\"&gt;University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne&lt;/a&gt; and a master's degree in the philosophy of &lt;a href=\"cognitive%20science\"&gt;cognitive science&lt;/a&gt; with a minor in aesthetics from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Sussex\"&gt;University of Sussex&lt;/a&gt;. He is currently pursuing a PhD in philosophy and cognitive science from &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20des%20hautes%20%C3%A9tudes%20en%20sciences%20sociales\"&gt;\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales&lt;/a&gt; and a PhD in philosophy from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oslo\"&gt;University of Oslo&lt;/a&gt;."
