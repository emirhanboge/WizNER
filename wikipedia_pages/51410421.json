    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Comoros\"&gt;Comoros&lt;/a&gt; was scheduled to compete at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2016 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.\nBackground.\nComoros made its Paralympic debut at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt; four years prior in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7\u201318 September 2016, a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 &lt;a href=\"National%20Paralympic%20Committees\"&gt;National Paralympic Committees&lt;/a&gt; took part. The Comoros team failed to show up to the Games.\nDisability classifications.\nEvery participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Paralympic%20Games%23Disability%20categories\"&gt;disability categories&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"amputation\"&gt;amputation&lt;/a&gt;, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; &lt;a href=\"cerebral%20palsy\"&gt;cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; &lt;a href=\"visual%20impairment\"&gt;visual impairment&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Les%20Autres%20sport%20classification\"&gt;Les autres&lt;/a&gt;, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example &lt;a href=\"dwarfism\"&gt;dwarfism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"multiple%20sclerosis\"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. Each &lt;a href=\"Paralympic%20Games%23Summer%20sports\"&gt;Paralympic sport&lt;/a&gt; then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability."
