In the early years after independence it was a scene of fluctuating fortunes between the Congress and the Left wing parties, till the latter captured power in the late seventies. The &lt;a href=\"United%20News%20of%20India\"&gt;United News of India&lt;/a&gt; in a candid analysis says, \u201cThe green surge swept Bengal to demolish the red bastion in 2011 Assembly elections\u2026 Moreover, as the Left still remained cornered in state politics, their neutralised voters are increasingly migrating to the BJP for a viable alternative.\u201d\nElection results.\n2021.\n \n2011.\nIn the 2011 elections, Nabin Chandra Bag of CPI(M) defeated his nearest rival Alok Kumar Majhi of Trinamool Congress.\n1977-2006.\nPrasanta Majhi of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;CPI (M)&lt;/a&gt; won the Khandaghosh (SC) assembly seat in &lt;a href=\"2006%20West%20Bengal%20state%20assembly%20election\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; defeating his nearest rival Biswanath Roy of &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Trinamool%20Congress\"&gt;Trinamool Congress&lt;/a&gt;.
