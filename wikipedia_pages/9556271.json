    "text": "\"Rhodopis\" ( ) is an ancient tale about a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; slave girl who marries the &lt;a href=\"Pharaoh\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The story was first recorded by the Greek historian &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; in the late first century BC or early first century AD and is considered the earliest known variant of the \"&lt;a href=\"Cinderella\"&gt;Cinderella&lt;/a&gt;\" story. The origins of the fairy-tale figure may be traced back to the 6th-century BC &lt;a href=\"hetaera\"&gt;hetaera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhodopis%20%28hetaera%29\"&gt;Rhodopis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nThe story is first recorded by the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; geographer &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; (64 or 63 BC \u2013 24 AD) in his \"&lt;a href=\"Geographica%20%28Strabo%29\"&gt;Geographica&lt;/a&gt;\" (book 17, 33), written sometime between c. 7 BC and c. 24 AD:\nSources.\nThe Greek geographer &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; (died c. 24 AD) first recorded the tale of the Greek girl Rhodopis in his \"&lt;a href=\"Geographica%20%28Strabo%29\"&gt;Geographica&lt;/a&gt;\". This passage is considered to be the earliest variant of the Cinderella story. The same story is also later reported by the Roman orator &lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Aelianus\"&gt;Aelian&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 175\u2013ca. 235) in his \"Miscellaneous History\", which was written entirely in Greek. Aelian's story closely resembles the story told by Strabo, but adds that the name of the pharaoh in question was Psammetichus. Aelian's account indicates that the story of Rhodopis remained popular throughout &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;antiquity&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt;, some five centuries before Strabo, records a popular legend about a possibly-related courtesan named &lt;a href=\"Rhodopis%20%28hetaera%29\"&gt;Rhodopis&lt;/a&gt; in his \"&lt;a href=\"Histories%20%28Herodotus%29\"&gt;Histories&lt;/a&gt;\", claiming that Rhodopis came from &lt;a href=\"Thrace\"&gt;Thrace&lt;/a&gt;, and was the slave of Iadmon (\u1f38\u03ac\u03b4\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd) of &lt;a href=\"Samos\"&gt;Samos&lt;/a&gt;, and a fellow-slave of the story-teller &lt;a href=\"Aesop\"&gt;Aesop&lt;/a&gt; and that she was taken to Egypt in the time of &lt;a href=\"Pharaoh\"&gt;Pharaoh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amasis%20II\"&gt;Amasis&lt;/a&gt; (570\u2013536 BC), and freed there for a large sum by Charaxus (\u03a7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03bf\u03c2) of &lt;a href=\"Mytilene\"&gt;Mytilene&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Sappho\"&gt;Sappho&lt;/a&gt; the lyric poet."
