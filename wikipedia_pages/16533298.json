    "text": "Thomas Kelly (13 September 1868 \u2013 20 April 1942) was an Irish &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Fianna%20F%C3%A1il\"&gt;Fianna F\u00e1il&lt;/a&gt; politician. He was a book and picture dealer before entering politics. He was a founder member of Sinn F\u00e9in and was elected to &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20Council\"&gt;Dublin City Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1899. Kelly was arrested after the 1916 &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Rising\"&gt;Easter Rising&lt;/a&gt; and sent to prison in England, and after becoming seriously ill, he was released back to Dublin.\nHe was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20St%20Stephen%27s%20Green%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dublin St Stephens's Green&lt;/a&gt; constituency at the &lt;a href=\"1918%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1918 general election&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and instead assembled at the &lt;a href=\"Mansion%20House%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Mansion House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; as a revolutionary parliament called &lt;a href=\"First%20D%C3%A1il\"&gt;D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt;.\nKelly was unanimously elected as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Dublin\"&gt;Lord Mayor of Dublin&lt;/a&gt; while being held in &lt;a href=\"HM%20Prison%20Wormwood%20Scrubs\"&gt;Wormwood Scrubs prison&lt;/a&gt; in England. Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to formally take up the position.\nHe was re-elected unopposed at the &lt;a href=\"1921%20Irish%20elections\"&gt;1921 elections&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20South%20%28D%C3%A1il%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dublin South&lt;/a&gt; constituency. He supported the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish%20Treaty\"&gt;Anglo-Irish Treaty&lt;/a&gt; but was too ill to attend the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish%20Treaty%20D%C3%A1il%20vote\"&gt;D\u00e1il vote&lt;/a&gt;. He served as substitute &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Labour%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Minister for Labour&lt;/a&gt; from 19 March 1919 to end of October 1919. He was again re-elected at the &lt;a href=\"1922%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1922 general election&lt;/a&gt; as a member of Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in but did not take his seat in the D\u00e1il.\nHe did not join &lt;a href=\"Cumann%20na%20nGaedheal\"&gt;Cumann na nGaedheal&lt;/a&gt; along with other pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TDs in 1923, nor did he contest the &lt;a href=\"1923%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1923 general election&lt;/a&gt;. In 1930 he joined Fianna F\u00e1il and was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Fianna%20F%C3%A1il\"&gt;Fianna F\u00e1il&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teachta%20D%C3%A1la\"&gt;Teachta D\u00e1la&lt;/a&gt; (TD) at the &lt;a href=\"1933%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1933 general election&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20South%20%28D%C3%A1il%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dublin South&lt;/a&gt;. He remained a TD and councillor until his death in 1942."
