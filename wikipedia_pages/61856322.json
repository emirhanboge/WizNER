    "text": "Arno K\u00f6lblin (9 October 1911 \u2013 19 December 1988) was a &lt;a href=\"German%20people\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; who was the &lt;a href=\"Heavyweight%20%28boxing%29\"&gt;heavyweight&lt;/a&gt; champion of Germany and Europe in the 1930s.\nCareer.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; the son of businessman Otto K\u00f6lblin and Hedwig K\u00f6lblin (n\u00e9e Richter), K\u00f6lblin turned professional shortly after leaving school. He made his debut on 12 March 1931 with a points win over Hans Bischoff. In July that year he stopped former German heavyweight champion &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Haymann\"&gt;Ludwig Haymann&lt;/a&gt; in the seventh round. These were the only two wins from his first seven fights. The mixed results continued into 1934, K\u00f6lblin suffering losses to &lt;a href=\"Vincenz%20Hower\"&gt;Vincenz Hower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motzi%20Spakow\"&gt;Motzi Spakow&lt;/a&gt;, but three straight wins between June and October that year, including a win over &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Sch%C3%B6nrath\"&gt;Hans Sch\u00f6nrath&lt;/a&gt; led to a German heavyweight title fight against Hower, the defending champion winning comfortably on points.\nAfter a run of eight fights in which he only lost once (to &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Heuser\"&gt;Adolf Heuser&lt;/a&gt;), he challenged Hower in August 1936 for the German heavyweight title; K\u00f6lblin knocked Hower out in the tenth round to become German champion. He successfully defended the title against &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Selle\"&gt;Werner Selle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Klein%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Erwin Klein&lt;/a&gt;, and in March 1937 challenged &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Charles%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Pierre Charles&lt;/a&gt; for the IBU European heavyweight title at the &lt;a href=\"Deutschlandhalle\"&gt;Deutschlandhalle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlottenburg\"&gt;Charlottenburg&lt;/a&gt;. K\u00f6lblin won on points to add the European title to his German title.\nHe successfully defended his German title against Hower in May 1937, but after losing to &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Phillips%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Eddie Phillips&lt;/a&gt; in a non-title fight in November 1937, lost the European title in March 1938 to &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Lazek\"&gt;Heinz Lazek&lt;/a&gt; after being disqualified in the second round at the &lt;a href=\"Sportpalast\"&gt;Sportpalast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schoeneberg\"&gt;Schoeneberg&lt;/a&gt; for repeated low blows. In November 1938, he also lost the German title, losing on points to &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Neusel\"&gt;Walter Neusel&lt;/a&gt;. In August 1939 he was set to fight &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Farr\"&gt;Tommy Farr&lt;/a&gt; in Wales, but with tensions growing between the UK and Germany, the Welsh branch of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Boxing%20Board%20of%20Control\"&gt;British Boxing Board of Control&lt;/a&gt; refused to recommend that the Ministry of Labour give him a permit to fight, prompting criticism from the German press, who saw it as a political decision. He beat Lazek in November 1939, and June 1940 challenged Neusel in an attempt to regain the German title, but Neusel again won on points.\nK\u00f6lblin was out of the ring after November 1942 due to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, but returned to boxing after the war, winning eight of his ten post-war fights, but losing two, including an unsuccessful challenge for &lt;a href=\"Hein%20ten%20Hoff\"&gt;Hein ten Hoff&lt;/a&gt;'s German title. His final fight was a fourth-round knockout of Heinz Klose in May 1950. He retired with a record of 50 wins from 78 fights, with 20 losses and 8 draws.\nIn the early 1950s, K\u00f6lblin worked as a coach in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956 he fled to &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, where he continued to work as a boxing trainer and later a manager.\nK\u00f6lblin died on 19 December 1998, at the age of 87."
