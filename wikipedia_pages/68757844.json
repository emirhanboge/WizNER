    "text": "The Orl\u00edk Killers was a gang of &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Serial%20killer\"&gt;serial killers&lt;/a&gt; who, between 1991 and 1993, killed five people (mostly businessmen) for monetary gain. One of the members committed a murder on his own and attempted another, but the victim in the latter attack survived.\nThe murderers would stuff their victims' bodies in barrels, dissolve them in &lt;a href=\"lye\"&gt;lye&lt;/a&gt; and then threw them into the &lt;a href=\"Orl%C3%ADk%20Reservoir\"&gt;Orl\u00edk Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, an idea initially proposed by Vladim\u00edr Kuna.\nMembers.\nKarel Kop\u00e1\u010d.\nKarel \u201eKarlos\u201c Kop\u00e1\u010d (June 3, 1960 \u2013 April 15, 2004) was the leader of the group. Before the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Revolution\"&gt;Velvet Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, he trained as a &lt;a href=\"miller\"&gt;miller&lt;/a&gt; and was once convicted for theft. After the revolution, he worked as a porter and bouncer in nightclubs, and developed an interest in martial arts. In the beginning of 1990, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;Rapid Response Unit&lt;/a&gt;, but left after a few months, allegedly due to a low salary and poor training.\nAfter quitting, he found work as an arms dealer, mostly trading &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0korpion\"&gt;\u0160korpion&lt;/a&gt; machine pistols and grenades. He lived at P\u0159\u00ed\u010dn\u00e1 840/22 in &lt;a href=\"Rudn%C3%A1%20%28Prague-West%20District%29\"&gt;Rudn\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, close to childhood friend and later accomplice, Vladim\u00edr Kuna.\nLudv\u00edk \u010cern\u00fd.\nLudv\u00edk \"Pacient\" \u010cern\u00fd (born May 25, 1965) was the main killer of the group. Before the revolution, he worked as a bricklayer, but also secretly sold illegal goods as a &lt;a href=\"Fartsovka\"&gt;fartsovchik&lt;/a&gt;. In 1985, he was convicted of theft and served a prison sentence. After the revolution, he found employment as a taxi driver at \"Mercedes-Benz Bohemia Praha\", and often visited gyms and solariums (in one of which he would later meet Kop\u00e1\u010d and Kuna). In 1992, \u010cern\u00fd married, and in 1995, the couple had a son. He was well-liked by his neighbors, regarded as a good husband and nicknamed \"Mim\u00edsek\" by acquaintances due to his kind appearance.\nVladim\u00edr Kuna.\nVladim\u00edr Kuna (born June 21, 1964) was a childhood friend of Kop\u00e1\u010d, who often accompanied him to the gyms &lt;a href=\"Podol%C3%AD%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Podol\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;. He would eventually set up his own gym in the cellar of his own home, where he stored a variety of weapons, including anti-tank &lt;a href=\"Rocket-propelled%20grenade\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; missiles.\nAccomplices.\nThe two remaining members were Kop\u00e1\u010d's sister, Irena Meierov\u00e1, and her boyfriend, Petr Choudounsk\u00fd (born July 19, 1965).\nMurders.\nAle\u0161 Katovsk\u00fd.\nIn 1991, Kop\u00e1\u010d met businessman Ale\u0161 Katovsk\u00fd, who hired him as a bodyguard and eventually gained his trust. The initial idea to kill the businessman and rob him of his money came from \u010cern\u00fd.\nOn April 5, 1991, Kop\u00e1\u010d and Katovsk\u00fd left for Rudn\u00e1, where \u010cern\u00fd, posing as a client interested in exchanging currencies, was waiting for them. At arrival, he told Katovsk\u00fd that he did not have the necessary amount to exchange, and asked to be driven to his home. When they reached the railroad crossing where Na Radosti Street crossed Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 Street in &lt;a href=\"Zli%C4%8D%C3%ADn\"&gt;Zli\u010d\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, \u010cern\u00fd shot Katovsk\u00fd in the head from the back seat. The car started swerving and there was a risk of it colliding with an incoming bus, but the criminals managed to regain control of it.\nKop\u00e1\u010d and \u010cern\u00fd then drove to a nearby landfill, wrapped up the body in &lt;a href=\"Chain-link%20fencing\"&gt;wire netting&lt;/a&gt;, put in the trunk of the car and drove to the \u017d\u010f\u00e1kov Bridge, where they threw the body in the water. From this killing, they acquired 800,000 &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20koruna\"&gt;koruna&lt;/a&gt;, with \u010cern\u00fd later selling the car at a bazaar to the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; owner of Musik Haus.\nLeorent Lipovec.\nThe second murder took place on January 9, 1992. On that date, Kuna had arranged to sell a weapon to Leorent Lipovec, a waiter who had immigrated from &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was to take place at Kuna's apartment in Rudn\u00e1, but unbeknownst to them, Lipovec had armed himself with a knife just in case he was attacked. While browsing the suitcase full of weapons, \u010cern\u00fd suddenly shot him in the head, frightening both Kop\u00e1\u010d and Kuna. Kop\u00e1\u010d later testified that \u010cern\u00fd replied to their shock by claiming that \"[He] was the &lt;a href=\"Joker%20%28character%29\"&gt;Joker&lt;/a&gt;!\", and since then, they referred to him as \"Pacient\" (The Patient, alluding to a psychiatric hospital). The trio gathered 30,000 koruna from this killing.\nAt this time, Kuna came up with the idea of disposing of the corpse by stuffing it into a barrel, which he had prepared in advance, and pouring lye over it. Kop\u00e1\u010d was initially unconvinced, but Kuna and \u010cern\u00fd nevertheless stuffed Lipovec's body inside, poured lye and water over it, and then boiled it. All three then loaded the barrel into a borrowed &lt;a href=\"Avia\"&gt;Avia&lt;/a&gt; truck and went to the \u017d\u010f\u00e1kov Bridge, where, like Katovsk\u00fd, threw it into the water.\nAfter the murder, \u010cern\u00fd started wearing the dead man's gold chain. He also expressed interest in appropriating Lipovec's apartment, but was dissuaded by Kop\u00e1\u010d. Using their victim's car, the trio drove to &lt;a href=\"Weiden%20in%20der%20Oberpfalz\"&gt;Weiden in der Oberpfalz&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, parked the car in front of a &lt;a href=\"hypermarket\"&gt;hypermarket&lt;/a&gt; and then drove back home.\nVlastimil Hodr.\nHodr, an antique dealer, was shot in the head near a gas station on Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 Street in Prague by \u010cern\u00fd, who wanted to steal a golden &lt;a href=\"Seal%20%28emblem%29\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; he was carrying on his person. He then contacted Kuna and Kop\u00e1\u010d to help dismember the body, as Hodr was too big and could not fit in the barrel at all. After finishing the procedure, they stuffed the remains and threw off the bridge into the water. The stolen seal was never recovered.\nAnna Medkov\u00e1.\nThe gang's next victim was Kuna's mother, Anna Medkov\u00e1, who owned a salon. On February 7, 1992, \u010cern\u00fd sent her a package containing a mixture of &lt;a href=\"semtex\"&gt;semtex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; and screws to her house in &lt;a href=\"Mnichovice\"&gt;Mnichovice&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after opening the package in her kitchen, it exploded in Medkova's hands, causing her serious injuries. Kuna, dissatisfied with the outcome, planned to suffocate his mother with a pillow while visiting her in the hospital, but she succumbed to her injuries five days later. The blast occurred on her birthday; however, this was not intentional, as Kuna allegedly did not know his mother's date of birth.\nThe murderers earned 1.6 million koruna through the murder. Kuna and his brother got half of the money at first, but his share was later stolen by other members. Petr Chodounsk\u00fd, playing the role of an entrepreneur, offered Kuna's brother a bargain - instead of the promised earnings, however, they stole his money.\nAfrim Kryeziu.\nThis murder was carried out solely by \u010cern\u00fd, and is normally not associated with the gang's activities. He was hired by a group of &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt; drug traffickers to carry out a job with the help of Afrim \"Frenki\" Kryeziu, a &lt;a href=\"Kosovo%20Albanians\"&gt;Kosovo Albanian&lt;/a&gt;. On the morning of June 1, 1993, \u010cern\u00fd was instructed to meet him on the corner of a house on V\u011btrn\u00e1 Street in the center of &lt;a href=\"Liberec\"&gt;Liberec&lt;/a&gt;. After seeing Kryezia approaching in his &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, \u010cern\u00fd pulled out a \u0160korpion submachine gun, firing nine times at the car and killing him. As a result, the car crashed into a stone pillar, which was part of a church fence that remained damaged for a long time. \u010cern\u00fd then left the scene on foot. The cartridges fired from his gun were later found on a stairway leading to Ryb\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 Street, as he had used a plastic bag while firing to avoid them being found by authorities at the actual scene of the shooting later on. His total haul amounted to 200,000 koruna.\nJaroslav Meier.\nAt one point, Kop\u00e1\u010d suggested that they could earn a lot of money by opening an erotic club, but as none of the gang members had the funds to run it, he approached his brother-in-law Jaroslav Meier and asked him to guarantee a bank loan on his house. Meier, who had built the house himself, refused. Kop\u00e1\u010d's wife, Irena, also learned of the suggestion, and at the end of 1992, she told her brother that if her husband was killed, the house would be handed to her and she would guarantee the loan. Her reason for the hit on her husband was her wanting to live with Chodounsk\u00fd, as well as personal interest in the property. Kop\u00e1\u010d was against the idea, and only pretended to be interested in front of his sister, even promising to procure the killer himself if she was being honest with him. He then had an acquaintance pretend to be a hired gunman, to whom Meierov\u00e1 handed over an envelope with the money Kop\u00e1\u010d had given her. To her surprise, these turned out to be newspaper clippings.\nAfter Kop\u00e1\u010d did not keep his promise, Meierov\u00e1 and Chodounsk\u00fd turned to \u010cern\u00fd, who accepted. On July 6, 1993, \u010cern\u00fd shot Meier four times with the \u0160korpion, which was supplied by Kop\u00e1\u010d, at his house in Rudn\u00e1. From the murder, the killers received 100,000 &lt;a href=\"Czech%20koruna\"&gt;koruna&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to court and criminal records, Chodounsk\u00fd was not Meier's lover and had never asked \u010cern\u00fd for anything.\nAttempted murder of J\u00e1n Mato.\nIn the summer of 1992, \u010cern\u00fd attempted to kill police officer J\u00e1n Mato, who knew some of the gang members from the gym. The reason for the crime was \u010cern\u00fd wanting to acquire his apartment in &lt;a href=\"Prague%205\"&gt;Prague 5&lt;/a&gt; and his service badge. Despite this, there is no indication that Mato knew of his friends' criminal activities.\nThat summer, Kop\u00e1\u010d, \u010cern\u00fd and Mato went to shoot at targets in Kuna's cellar. At one point, \u010cern\u00fd put a pistol to Mato's head and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed and did not fire. Mato, in a calm manner, insulted his would-be killer and promptly left. Later on, he would be disciplined for associating with the gang members. In 2002, he was murdered in the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Metro\"&gt;Prague Metro&lt;/a&gt; in an unrelated matter.\nAccident.\nOn January 7, 1994, Kuna and Kop\u00e1\u010d were driving when the latter suddenly lost control and crashed the car. Both men were taken to the hospital - Kuna received minor injuries, but Kop\u00e1\u010d suffered a spinal injury which left him confined in a wheelchair. Since then, he refused to participate in any criminal activities, but still did not want to go to police, as he was afraid the other members would kill him. He later claimed that the crash was punishment for the deeds he had committed.\nFindings and arrests.\nIn 1993, criminal investigators heard unsubstantiated rumors about several entrepreneurs who had \"disappeared\". Among these were vague claims were that \u010cern\u00fd had boasted of \"disappearing\" several people, but due to lacking evidence and nothing pointing towards specific victims, this was not investigated further.\nThe first tangible piece of evidence were traces of blood on the seat of a vehicle \u010cern\u00fd had sold to a car dealership, which was later conclusively proven as belonging to Ale\u0161 Katovsk\u00fd. Acting upon information that some businessmen had been buried at the bottom of a dam, police began searching in vain at the &lt;a href=\"Slapy%20Reservoir\"&gt;Slapy Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. While investigating \u010cern\u00fd, the investigators obtained records from a dealership that not only he had borrowed an Avia at the time of the alleged disappearances, but according to the number of kilometers driven, the Orl\u00edk Reservoir was identified as a possible dumping site for the bodies.\nOn July 10, 1995, divers were dispatched to explore the bottom of the dam. The search lasted weeks, since Czech police lacked the necessary equipment to search waters more than 40 meters deep. A &lt;a href=\"TV%20Nova%20%28Czech%20Republic%29\"&gt;TV Nova&lt;/a&gt; crew also arrived at the survey site, and at the request of the police, produced a cover story claiming that the purpose of the hightened activity was cleaning the bottom of the reservoir. After a few days, two barrels containing human remains and a body wrapped in wire netting were found.\nWhen he learned about the discovery of the bodies while watching TV, Kop\u00e1\u010d decided to commit suicide. He called the police beforehand and confessed to the crimes, but persuaded from doing so after three hours of negotiations. During his arrest, he was shot in the crotch. At first, Kop\u00e1\u010d refused to cooperate, but after learning that \u010cern\u00fd was denying everything and the other members had tried to pin the blame entirely on him, Kop\u00e1\u010d decided to put his confessions in writing. This written confession would later be used as the prosecution's main evidence in the case.\nIn it, Kop\u00e1\u010d claimed that the lye was provided by &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Roubal\"&gt;Ivan Roubal&lt;/a&gt;, and from the money he had received, he had bought a vila in the Vyso\u010dany district, where he wanted to set up a gym.\nTrial, imprisonment and later fates.\nOn April 18, 1997, after a 4-month long trial and nine court sessions, all five defendants were found guilty and convicted of their respective crimes. Ludv\u00edk \u010cern\u00fd and Vladim\u00edr Kuna were sentenced to &lt;a href=\"life%20imprisonment\"&gt;life imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, Karel Kop\u00e1\u010d to 21 years, Petr Chodounsk\u00fd to 14 years for fraud and Irena Meierov\u00e1 to 12 years. Each of them appealed their sentences, but the &lt;a href=\"appellate%20court\"&gt;appellate court&lt;/a&gt; later only reduced Kuna and Meierov\u00e1's sentences (25 years and 10 years, respectively), while upholding the others'.\nKarel Kop\u00e1\u010d refused to accept the verdict, and on April 15, 2004, he hanged himself at the &lt;a href=\"Ku%C5%99im\"&gt;Ku\u0159im&lt;/a&gt; prison with his pajama cords. Irena Meierov\u00e1 was paroled in 2002 and is now said to live in &lt;a href=\"Jino%C4%8Dany\"&gt;Jino\u010dany&lt;/a&gt; under a new identity; Petr Chodounsk\u00fd was released in 2011. Vladim\u00edr Kuna was paroled for good behavior on June 18, 2013 and is said to live somewhere near &lt;a href=\"Chomutov\"&gt;Chomutov&lt;/a&gt; with his new wife, whom he married in prison.\nLudv\u00edk \u010cern\u00fd later changed his surname to Z\u00e1me\u010dn\u00edk and applied for parole on October 5, 2017, but his request was rejected. He was also revealed to be involved in two other prominent crimes:"
