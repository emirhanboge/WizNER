    "text": "Tamil mythology means the stories and sacred narratives belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20people\"&gt;Tamil people&lt;/a&gt;. This body of &lt;a href=\"mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt; is a mix of elements from the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20culture\"&gt;Tamil culture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dravidian%20peoples\"&gt;Dravidian culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley&lt;/a&gt; cultures along with the &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; religious aspects.\nGods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20literature\"&gt;Tamil literature&lt;/a&gt; in parallel with the &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; literature formed a major source of information on Hindu culture. The ancient Tamil epics forms the source of various historical figures in Hindu scripture like &lt;a href=\"Agastya\"&gt;Agastya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iravan\"&gt;Iravan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patanjali\"&gt;Patanjali&lt;/a&gt; etc. &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20literature\"&gt;Ancient Tamil literature&lt;/a&gt; is the source of Tamil deities like &lt;a href=\"Murugan\"&gt;Murugan&lt;/a&gt; and Kortravai. &lt;a href=\"Tolk%C4%81ppiyam\"&gt;Tholkappiyam&lt;/a&gt; mentions Seyon or \"the red one \"and kortravai as the goddess who was worshiped in the dry lands. Tamil literature forms the source of history of &lt;a href=\"Nataraja\"&gt;Nataraja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meenakshi\"&gt;Meenakshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirumala%20Venkateswara%20Temple\"&gt;Tirupati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rameswaram\"&gt;Rameswaram&lt;/a&gt;.\nKartikeya.\nKartikeya (, ), also known as Skanda, Kumara, Murugan and Subrahmanya, is the &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; god of war. He is the son of &lt;a href=\"Parvati\"&gt;Parvati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Ganesha\"&gt;Ganesha&lt;/a&gt;, and a god whose life story has many versions in Hinduism. An important deity around &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; since ancient times, Kartikeya is particularly popular and predominantly worshipped in South India, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia as Murugan.\nKartikeya is an ancient god, traceable to the &lt;a href=\"Vedic\"&gt;Vedic&lt;/a&gt; era. Archaeological evidence from 1st-century CE and earlier, where he is found with Hindu god &lt;a href=\"Agni\"&gt;Agni&lt;/a&gt; (fire), suggest that he was a significant deity in early Hinduism. He is found in many medieval temples all over India, such as at the &lt;a href=\"Ellora%20Caves\"&gt;Ellora Caves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elephanta%20Caves\"&gt;Elephanta Caves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe iconography of Kartikeya varies significantly; he is typically represented as an ever-youthful man, riding or near a peacock, dressed with weapons sometimes near a rooster. Most icons show him with one head, but some show him with six heads reflecting the legend surrounding his birth. He grows up quickly into a philosopher-warrior, destroys evil in the form of demon &lt;a href=\"Tarakasura\"&gt;Taraka&lt;/a&gt;, teaches the pursuit of ethical life and the theology of &lt;a href=\"Shaiva%20Siddhanta\"&gt;Shaiva Siddhanta&lt;/a&gt;. He has inspired many poet-saints, such as &lt;a href=\"Arunagirinathar\"&gt;Arunagirinathar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAyyappan.\n(),() (also called Sastavu, or &lt;a href=\"Shasta%20%28deity%29\"&gt;Sasta&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; deity worshiped in a number of shrines across &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Ayyappan is believed to be an incarnation of &lt;a href=\"Dharmasasta\"&gt;Dharma Sasta&lt;/a&gt;, who is the offspring of &lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href=\"Mohini\"&gt;Mohini&lt;/a&gt;, is the only female avatar of the God Vishnu) and is generally depicted in a &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;yogic posture&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a jewel around his neck, hence named Manikandan. Ayyappan may bear a historical relationship to the &lt;a href=\"tutelary%20deity\"&gt;tutelary deity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aiyanar\"&gt;Aiyanar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"asura\"&gt;asura&lt;/a&gt; princess Mahishi was burning up with anger at the trick the gods had pulled on her brother, the asura king &lt;a href=\"Mahishasura\"&gt;Mahishasura&lt;/a&gt;. As Mahishasura was blessed with invulnerability to all men, the gods had sent goddess &lt;a href=\"Durga\"&gt;Durga&lt;/a&gt;, to fight and kill him. Thus, Mahishi began performing a fearsome set of austerities, and pleased the creator god &lt;a href=\"Brahma\"&gt;Brahma&lt;/a&gt;. She asked for the boon of invulnerability, but Brahma said it was not possible so Mahishi planned and asked invulnerability to all men except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu (Both are male &amp; no possibility to give birth to any one). He granted her the boon of ruling the universe and being invulnerable except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu. Since such a person did not exist, she thought she was safe and began conquering and plundering the world.\nThe gods implored Shiva and Vishnu to save them from this catastrophe. Vishnu found a possible solution to the problem. When Vishnu had taken on the &lt;a href=\"Kurma\"&gt;Kurma&lt;/a&gt; Avatar, he also had to manifest himself as &lt;a href=\"Mohini\"&gt;Mohini&lt;/a&gt;, the enchantress, to save the nectar of immortality (ambrosia or amrit) from the demons who were not willing to share it with the gods. If he became Mohini again, then the female Mohini and the male Shiva could have the divine child who would combine their powers and beat Mahishi.\nSome versions give a slightly more detailed version of the union of Shiva with Vishnu. One version tells that the asura Bhasmasura had so pleased Lord Shiva with his austerities that Shiva gave him a boon of anything he wished. So Bhasmasura asked for the ability to burn to ashes anything which he placed his hand over. No sooner had Shiva granted this, than Bhasmasura ran after the god, threatening to turn him to ashes.\nShiva called to Lord Vishnu for help. He hide himself in a peepal tree as Bhasmasura ran here and there searching for the god. Vishnu became aware of the events, and decided that he would take the female form Mohini, \"the Enchanting\", and try to trump the asura's powers. When Bhasmasura saw Vishnu in this form, he was bewitched by her beauty. He earnestly tried to court her. So Vishnu instructed Bhasmasura to hold his hand over his head, and vow fidelity. With this act, Bhasmasura was reduced to ashes.\nVishnu found Shiva and explained the whole affair to him. Shiva asked if he too could see Vishnu in this female form. When Vishnu appeared thus, Shiva was overcome with passion, and united with her. The two gods thus became \"&lt;a href=\"Harihara\"&gt;Harihara Murthi&lt;/a&gt;\", that is a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu as one god.\nFrom this union, Lord Sree Dharma Sastha was born. He combined in himself the powers of Vishnu and Shiva. Lord Ayyappan is an incarnation of Lord Sree Dharma Sastha and Lord Ayyappan is a visible embodiment of their essential identity. Sri Ayyappa belongs to Pandya Royal Community. He was the head of a clan. It is believed Sri Ayyappa merged to sri dharma sastha. Lord Vishnu gifted the new-born deity with a little bejeweled bell necklace, so this god is called Manikandan. He is also known as Dharma Shasthavu, Kerala Puthran.\nThirumal.\nPerumal () also Thirumal () is the &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; most popular amongst &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20people\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; state in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20diaspora\"&gt;Tamil diaspora&lt;/a&gt;. Perumal is another name of &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;.\nMentions in sangam literature.\nTamil &lt;a href=\"Sangam%20literature\"&gt;Sangam literature&lt;/a&gt; (200BCE to 500CE) mentions M\u0101yon or the \"dark one,\"as the supreme deity who creates, sustains and destroys the universe and was worshiped in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Tamilakam\"&gt;Tamilagam&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;a href=\"Parip%C4%81%E1%B9%ADal\"&gt;Paripadal&lt;/a&gt;-3 describes the glory of &lt;a href=\"Thirumal\"&gt;Thirumal&lt;/a&gt; in the most superlative terms.\nParipadal(3)by kaduvan iLaveyinanAr:\n\"thIyinuL theRal nI poovinuL naaRRa nI kallinuL maNiyu nI sollinuL vaaymai aRaththinuL anbu nI maRaththinuL mainthu nI\nvEthaththu maRai nI boothaththu madhalu nI vencudar oLiyu nI thingaLuL aLiyu nI anaiththu nI anaiththinut poruLu nI\"\nThe last line states that Thirumal is the supreme deity who is the inner controller (&lt;a href=\"Antaryamin\"&gt;Antaryamin&lt;/a&gt;) of the entire universe. This is one of the Lord's glories, which is first mentioned in Vedas and later propounded by Alwars in Prabhandams and Sri Vaishnavaite Acharyas in various commentaries.\nPopularity in Tamil Nadu.\nThirumal (Vishnu) is the only deity who has enjoyed the status of Paramporul during the &lt;a href=\"Sangam%20period\"&gt;Sangam&lt;/a&gt; age. The reference to \"Mukkol Bhagavars\" in Sangam literature clearly indicates that only Vaishnavaite saints holding Tridanda existed during the sangam age and Thirumal was glorified as the supreme deity whose divine lotus feet can burn all our evils and grant Moksha (Maru Piraparukkum Maasil Sevadi). During the post-Sangam period, his worship was further glorified by the alwars and great &lt;a href=\"Vaishnavite\"&gt;Vaishnavite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"acharyas\"&gt;acharyas&lt;/a&gt;.\nNatrajar of Chidambaram.\nThe story of Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (\"vanam\" meaning forest and \"thillai\" trees - botanical name \"&lt;a href=\"Excoecaria\"&gt;Exocoeria agallocha&lt;/a&gt;\", a species of mangrove trees - which currently grows in the &lt;a href=\"Pichavaram\"&gt;Pichavaram&lt;/a&gt; wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or '&lt;a href=\"rishis\"&gt;rishis&lt;/a&gt;' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and \"mantras\" or magical words. Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of &lt;a href=\"Bhikshatana\"&gt;Bhikshatana&lt;/a&gt;, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as &lt;a href=\"Mohini\"&gt;Mohini&lt;/a&gt;. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance and the beauty of The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (\"&lt;a href=\"n%C4%81gas\"&gt;n\u0101gas&lt;/a&gt;\") by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).\nThe rishis gathered all their spiritual strength and invoked a powerful demon Muyalakan - a symbol of complete arrogance and ignorance. Lord Shiva wore a gentle smile, stepped on the demon's back, immobilized him and performed the \"\u00c1nanda Tandava\" (the dance of eternal bliss) and disclosed his true form. The sages surrender, realizing that Lord Shiva is the truth and He is beyond magic and rituals.\nMeenakshi.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Indra\"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt; killed a demon, even though the demon did not harm anyone. This act brought a curse upon Indra that forced him to continue wandering until he was walking around looking for a way where no one would tell him which way to go will redeem him from his &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt;. After much wandering, Indra was freed from his suffering through the power of a &lt;a href=\"Lingam\"&gt;Shivalingam&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;, and so he built a small &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; at that site.\nIt so happened that at that time in &lt;a href=\"South%20India\"&gt;South India&lt;/a&gt; there was a &lt;a href=\"Pandyan%20Dynasty\"&gt;Pandya&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Monarch\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; called Malayadhwaja Pandiyan ruling a small city by the name \"Manavur\", which was quite near to this Shivalinga. He was the son of \"Kulashekara\" Pandyan. He came to know about the Shivalinga and decided to build a huge temple for Shiva in the forest \"Kadambavanam\" (\"vanam\" means forest). He also developed the region into a fine princely state called &lt;a href=\"Madurai\"&gt;Madurai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe king was childless and sought an heir for the &lt;a href=\"monarchy\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Shiva granted him his prayers through an \"Ayonija\" child (one born not from the womb). This child was three years old and actually the incarnation of goddess &lt;a href=\"Parvati\"&gt;Parvati&lt;/a&gt; the consort of &lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt;. She was born with fish-shaped eyes. It was said that the extra breast would disappear when she met her future husband. She was named \"M\u012bnachchi\", (meaning \"fish eyed\") from the words \"m\u012bna\" (meaning fish) and \"ak\u1e63i\" (meaning eyes). M\u012bnakshi also means \"the one who has eyes like that of a fish\". Fishes are said to feed their younger ones with their eyes, similarly goddess looks after her devotees. Just by her sight our miseries disappear.\nShe grew up to be a Shiva-Shakti personification. After the death of the king, she ruled the kingdom with skillful administration.\nIn one of her expeditions she went to the &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; and there, on seeing Shiva, her extra breast disappeared. Many of the gods and goddesses came to witness their marriage.\nAt the wedding celebrations the gods refused to have the served food unless Shiva performed a majestic dance for everybody gathered at the place. At this there was the dance of &lt;a href=\"Chidambaram\"&gt;Chidambaram&lt;/a&gt;, the \"cosmic dance\" in front of his wife Minakshi. It epitomised and merged all life force and beauty into one whole. In the end Minakshi was merged with the &lt;a href=\"Lingam\"&gt;shivalingam&lt;/a&gt; and became the representation of life and beauty.\nThere is another legend that talks about why the North Tower (called as \"Mottai Gopuram\") does not have that many sculptures. Bhootaganas were supposed to finish the construction of the temple towers during the night. Legend says that bhootaganas completed all three towers but while in the middle of building the north tower sunrise happened halting the completion of the north tower.\nA Tamil poem shows the goddess Meenakshi as a girl washing crockery and pots (which consist of all the worlds). This is a daily task, because her husband Shiva repeatedly messes up the universe, which Minakshi must once more sort out and clean.\nIn thirty words, Minakshi becomes a global icon for all who deal with 'impossible' children (or husbands). Themes and activities of early childhood run through the poems. God in the little child is worshipped and protected amidst the toys in the kitchen and back yard\nKannagi.\n&lt;a href=\"Kannagi\"&gt;Kannagi&lt;/a&gt; or (Kannaki), a &lt;a href=\"legend\"&gt;legend&lt;/a&gt;ary &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20people\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; woman, is the central character of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Indian\"&gt;South Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Epic%20poetry\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Silapadhigaaram\"&gt;Silapathikaram&lt;/a&gt;\" (100-300 CE). The story relates how Kannagi took revenge on the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Pandyan%20Kingdom\"&gt;early Pandyan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nedunj%20Cheliyan%20I\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Madurai\"&gt;Madurai&lt;/a&gt;, for a mistaken death penalty imposed on her husband &lt;a href=\"Kovalan\"&gt;Kovalan&lt;/a&gt;, by cursing the city with &lt;a href=\"disaster\"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kodungallur%20Bhagavathy%20Temple\"&gt;Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple&lt;/a&gt; was built to commemorate the martyrdom of &lt;a href=\"Kannagi\"&gt;Kannagi&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that sixth avatar of &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;, Sage &lt;a href=\"Parasurama\"&gt;Parasurama&lt;/a&gt; built this temple for the prosperity of the people. According to the old chronicles, this Bhagavathi temple was created in the heart of the town many centuries ago to serve a special purpose.\nLegend says that, after the creation of &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Parasurama\"&gt;Parasurama&lt;/a&gt;, he was harassed by a demon called Daruka. To kill this evil demon, &lt;a href=\"Parasurama\"&gt;Parasurama&lt;/a&gt; prayed to Lord &lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt; for help. As advised by Shiva, Parasurama constructed the shrine and installed the Shakti Devi as Bhagavathi. The deity in the temple, it is believed, is Parashakthi herself. According to legends, it was Bhadrakali who killed the evil demon Daruka.\nShe is worshiped as goddess &lt;a href=\"Pattini\"&gt;Pattini&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Sinhalese%20people\"&gt;Sinhalese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buddhists\"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt;, Kannaki Amman by the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20people\"&gt;Sri Lankan Tamil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hindus\"&gt;Hindus'&lt;/a&gt; (See &lt;a href=\"Hinduism%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Hinduism in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;) and as Kodungallur Bhagavathy and Attukal Bhagavathy in the South Indian state of Kerala.\nKannagi is also viewed as a brave woman who could demand justice directly from the King and even dared to call him \"unenlightened king\" (\"Thera Manna\", Vazhakkurai Kathai, Silappathikaram).\n&lt;a href=\"Mariamman\"&gt;Mariamma&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Powerful Tamil Saints :The Siddhars.\nSiddhars (Tamil: \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd) are saints in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, mostly of the Saivaite denomination in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, who professed and practised an unorthodox type of &lt;a href=\"Sadhana\"&gt;Sadhana&lt;/a&gt;, or spiritual practice, to attain liberation. Yogic powers called &lt;a href=\"Siddhi\"&gt;Siddhi&lt;/a&gt;s are acquired by constant practice of certain yogic disciplines. Those who acquire these Siddhis are called &lt;a href=\"Siddhas\"&gt;Siddhas&lt;/a&gt;. These sidhars can be compared to &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mystics&lt;/a&gt; of the western civilization.\nSiddhars are people who are believed to control and transcend the barriers of time and space by meditation (&lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt;), after the use of substances called &lt;a href=\"Rasayanas\"&gt;Rasayanas&lt;/a&gt; that transform the body to make it potentially deathless, and a particular breathing-practice, a type of &lt;a href=\"Pranayama\"&gt;Pranayama&lt;/a&gt;. Through their practices they are believed to have reached stages of insight which enabled them to tune into the powers hidden in various material substances and practices, useful for suffering and ignorant mankind. Typically Siddhars were saints, doctors, alchemists and mysticists all at once. They wrote their findings, in the form of &lt;a href=\"poem\"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil language&lt;/a&gt;, on palm leaves which are collected and stored in what are known today as &lt;a href=\"Palm%20leaf%20manuscript\"&gt;Palm leaf manuscript&lt;/a&gt;, today still owned by private families in Tamil Nadu and handed down through the generations, as well as public institutions such as &lt;a href=\"Universities\"&gt;Universities&lt;/a&gt; all over the world (India, Germany, Great Britain, U.S.).\nIn this way Siddhars developed, among other branches of a vast knowledge-system, what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Siddha\"&gt;Siddha&lt;/a&gt; medicine, practised mainly in Tamil Nadu as Traditional native &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;. A rustic form of healing that is similar to &lt;a href=\"Siddha\"&gt;Siddha&lt;/a&gt; medicine has since been practised by experienced elderly in the villages of Tamil Nadu. (This has been misunderstood as \"Paatti Vaitthiyam, Naattu marunthu\" and \"Mooligai marutthuvam\". While paati vaitthiyam or naatu marunthu is traditional Tamil medicine and mooligai marutthuvam is ayurvedic medicine.) They are also founders of &lt;a href=\"Varmam\"&gt;Varmam&lt;/a&gt; - a martial art for &lt;a href=\"self-defence\"&gt;self-defence&lt;/a&gt; and medical treatment at the same time. &lt;a href=\"Varmam\"&gt;Varmam&lt;/a&gt; are specific points located in the human body which when pressed in different ways can give various results, such as disabling an attacker in self-defence, or balancing a physical condition as an easy first-aid medical treatment.\nTamil Siddhars were the first to develop pulse-reading (\"naadi paarththal\" in Tamil) to identify the origin of diseases. This method was later copied and used in ayurvedha.\nSiddhars have also written many religious poems. It is believed that most of them have lived for ages, in a mystic mountain called Sathuragiri, near Thanipparai village in Tamil Nadu.\nOne of the best-known Siddhars was &lt;a href=\"Agastyar\"&gt;Agasthyar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Agasthya\"&gt;Agasthya&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to be the founding father of Siddha culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Abithana%20Chintamani\"&gt;Abithana Chintamani&lt;/a&gt; states Siddhars are either of the 9 or 18 persons enlisted, but sage &lt;a href=\"Agastyar\"&gt;Agastyar&lt;/a&gt; states that there are many who precede these and follow 9 or 18 persons. Many of the great Siddhars are regarded to have powers magical and spiritual.\nSome Siddhars.\nThe 9 siddhars.\nThe 9 listed as Abithana Chintamani states is as follows:\nThere are totally 18 siddhars in the Tamil siddha tradition.see &lt;a href=\"Siddhar\"&gt;Siddhar&lt;/a&gt;\nPowers of siddhars.\nThe siddhars are believed to have had powers both major and other \u2018minor\u2019 powers. They are explained in detail in various yogic as well as religious texts. They also have the power converting their mass to energy and thereby travel in space in light speed to different universe.\nThese eight are the Great Siddhis (Ashtama siddhis), or &lt;a href=\"eight%20great%20perfections\"&gt;Great Perfections&lt;/a&gt;."
