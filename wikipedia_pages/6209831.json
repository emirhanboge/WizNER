    "text": "Ernesto Balducci (6 August 1922 \u2013 25 April 1992) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20priest\"&gt;Catholic priest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"peace%20activist\"&gt;peace activist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiographical notes.\nBalducci was born in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fiora\"&gt;Santa Fiora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuscany\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen he was twelve, his father was laid off and the \"&lt;a href=\"Scolopi\"&gt;Scolopi&lt;/a&gt;\", a religious foundation dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt;, offered him a free place in &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt;. He studied &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, then Letters and &lt;a href=\"Philosophy\"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe foundation of the Centro d'Impegno Cristiano \"Cenacolo\" (Centre for Christian Commitment) in 1952 gave him the chance to intensify both his friendship with the &lt;a href=\"charismatic\"&gt;charismatic&lt;/a&gt; mayor of &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20La%20Pira\"&gt;Giorgio La Pira&lt;/a&gt;, and his relationship with the author-priest &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Milani\"&gt;Lorenzo Milani&lt;/a&gt; and the disciples of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Maritain\"&gt;Jacques Maritain&lt;/a&gt;, known as the 'Little Brothers'. In 1958 Balducci founded the monthly review \"Testimonianze\" (\"Testimonies\"), which he directed for 34 years. In 1963 he openly defended the first Italian &lt;a href=\"conscientious%20objector\"&gt;conscientious objector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Gozzini\"&gt;Giuseppe Gozzini&lt;/a&gt;. His articles, and the subsequent trial, gave the &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; of Florence, monsignor Florit, the opportunity to \"exile\" Balducci. He stayed in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, very near the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;Second Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt;, until 1965 when, thanks to the direct intervention of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt;, he went back to &lt;a href=\"Tuscany\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;. Not in Florence, however, where &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; Florit was still involved in his confrontation against La Pira, but at the abbey named \"Badia Fiesolana\", two hundred yards from the border of the &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocese&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the isolation of the abbey, he had less and less time for his studies, as most of his days were taken up by the magazine \"Testimonianze\", by the publishing house \"Cultura della pace\", (\"&lt;a href=\"Peace\"&gt;Peace&lt;/a&gt; culture\"), by his cooperation with daily papers and other periodical and by his direct and unflagging attendance at dozens of demonstrations and &lt;a href=\"debates\"&gt;debates&lt;/a&gt; all over Italy.\nHe campaigned against the grounds of war, both before and after the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20War\"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;, and used the five hundredth anniversary in 1992 of the &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Columbus\"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"discovery%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;discovery of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;, as the occasion to put the very foundations of &lt;a href=\"modernity\"&gt;modernity&lt;/a&gt; in question, and these campaigns became a point of reference for the large Italian &lt;a href=\"peace%20movement\"&gt;peace movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was while returning from one of these debates that Ernesto Balducci was involved in a car accident. He was admitted to hospital in &lt;a href=\"coma\"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt;, and died on 25 April 1992.\nThe Planetary Human.\nErnesto Balducci analysed &lt;a href=\"religions\"&gt;religions&lt;/a&gt; in relation to their capacity to be or not to be sources of a historic salvation. A salvation that does not remain in the alienating extra-historic and existential level.\nThe most modern themes of the &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; come together in this reflection, from &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Barth\"&gt;Karl Barth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dietrich%20Bonhoeffer\"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer&lt;/a&gt;, with their intention of dividing &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"faith\"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt; and overturning the point of view focused on &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; for showing up the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;, instead. The post-religious human.\nIn Balducci's view, the religions are the millenary legacy of cultural particularisms, as ideological, political, cultural and spiritual \"cohesion tools\" for cultural &lt;a href=\"Monad%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;monads&lt;/a&gt; that, however, have lost their individuality. \nBy facing up to the apocalyptic threats of modern &lt;a href=\"war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, now religions have two possible functions. Either a regressive function of protective recall to particular identities, or a prophetic ferment function for the transaction to the \"planetary era\". A ferment in deeper affinity with their very founding intuitions.\nAccording to Balducci, the reclamation of religious identities has to be based on a &lt;a href=\"laity\"&gt;lay&lt;/a&gt; approach to the peace question in order to bring into play each of the various memories of mankind. All this without abandoning certain universal achievements of the Western culture, like the principle of the preeminence of &lt;a href=\"conscience\"&gt;conscience&lt;/a&gt; with respect to any law, the correlative principle of the State of Right and the &lt;a href=\"Scientific%20Method\"&gt;Scientific Method&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe synthesis of the \"Planetary Human\" aims to involve disparate subjects in the name of a fundamental &lt;a href=\"subjectivity\"&gt;subjectivity&lt;/a&gt; that identifies itself with the &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crisis of &lt;a href=\"modernity\"&gt;modernity&lt;/a&gt; drives Balducci to define the terms of a newly-grounded &lt;a href=\"Social%20contract\"&gt;Social contract&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20community\"&gt;World community&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Reason\"&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of the Western people's \u00abhyperbolic subjectivity\u00bb, plays a fundamental role, so far.\nBy taking the suggestions of &lt;a href=\"Ernesto%20de%20Martino\"&gt;Ernesto de Martino&lt;/a&gt;, Balducci believes that the long \"prehistory\" of narrow communication among cultural \"islands\", in which the fear of the different has been a reflex that has cemented the &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;, is over. Even the &lt;a href=\"aggressiveness\"&gt;aggressiveness&lt;/a&gt; against the other groups made sense as long as there were not the unifying frameworks of the planet. But the menaces to the survival of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; species unify the destiny of everyone. The mankind, from the \"homination phase\", goes on to the planetarization (&lt;a href=\"globalization\"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt;) phase.\nBalducci observes that &lt;a href=\"Anthropology\"&gt;Anthropology&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 originally based on the &lt;a href=\"ontology\"&gt;ontology&lt;/a&gt; of the \"difference\" (the others and us, peoples of &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; and peoples of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"civilized\"&gt;civilized&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"primitive%20culture\"&gt;primitives&lt;/a&gt;) \u2013 then discovered the possibility of different ways to be humans in the time and the space. By repudiating its own earlier assumptions, &lt;a href=\"Anthropology\"&gt;Anthropology&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the longing of each peculiar human expression towards a universal rule that joins humans, and them with nature. This is the sense that Balducci catches in various cultural itineraries: the &lt;a href=\"structuralism\"&gt;structuralism&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Claude%20L%C3%A9vi-Strauss\"&gt;Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss&lt;/a&gt;, the \"ecology of mind\" of &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Bateson\"&gt;Gregory Bateson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"generative%20grammar\"&gt;generative grammar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Noam%20Chomsky\"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;.\nBalducci bases his thought on such yearning towards the &lt;a href=\"Universality%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;universal&lt;/a&gt;. Many of its symbolizations are about the &lt;a href=\"dialectic\"&gt;dialectic&lt;/a&gt; between particular and universal dimensions of the human.\nHe borrows from &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Bloch\"&gt;Ernst Bloch&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"dialectic\"&gt;dialectic&lt;/a&gt; between the \"cultured human\" (\"homo editus\") and the \"hidden human\" (\"homo absconditus\"), a dialectic between the \"being\" and the \"being able to\" of the human, an aspiration that is a &lt;a href=\"Transcendence%20%28religion%29\"&gt;transcendence&lt;/a&gt; without transcending, a \u00ab&lt;a href=\"Transcendence%20%28religion%29\"&gt;transcendence&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"immanence\"&gt;immanence&lt;/a&gt;\u00bb\nThe Balducci crossing appears to be a sort of anthropologic &lt;a href=\"teleology\"&gt;teleology&lt;/a&gt; which represents an &lt;a href=\"evolutionary\"&gt;evolutionary&lt;/a&gt; trend that the human being can support or disclaim in its path. The &lt;a href=\"reason\"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt;, as said by Balducci, finds a brand-new &lt;a href=\"categorical%20imperative\"&gt;categorical imperative&lt;/a&gt;:\n \u00abAct only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that the human species would find the reasons and the guarantees of its survival\u00bb (in \"La terra del tramonto\").\nBalducci recognized in the declining freedom of action of states and in the growth of the &lt;a href=\"Cosmopolitanism\"&gt;cosmopolitan right&lt;/a&gt; an element deeply rooted in the evolutionary laws of human species. The \"faith in Man\" (a &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Teilhard%20de%20Chardin\"&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&lt;/a&gt; concept), the consideration that our species has always creatively got over many severe and extreme challenges, the chance of the \"planetary human\": all this things make sense to Balducci if the sense of belonging with a supranational community will generate a planetary political project. A project that matches the &lt;a href=\"world%20community\"&gt;world community&lt;/a&gt;, an entity arising \u00abon the strength of the evolutionary laws of the &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, the same laws that lead from the &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, from the city to the &lt;a href=\"nation-state\"&gt;nation-state&lt;/a&gt;.\u00bb\nIn order to decipher the momentum towards the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"world%20community\"&gt;world community&lt;/a&gt;, Balducci recalls two categories of the &lt;a href=\"natural%20law\"&gt;natural law&lt;/a&gt;: the \"pactum unionis\" and the \"pactum subjectionis\".\nThe former momentum is identified in view of the anthropologic &lt;a href=\"pacifism\"&gt;pacifism&lt;/a&gt;, which horizon is a &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt; that is made compact by relationships of spontaneous reciprocity and by the preferential option for &lt;a href=\"non-violence\"&gt;non-violence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second momentum relies on the perspective of the political &lt;a href=\"Realism%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;realism&lt;/a&gt;, oriented to extend to the entire planet the process of unification relying upon the &lt;a href=\"monopoly%20on%20the%20legitimate%20use%20of%20physical%20force\"&gt;monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dialectic\"&gt;dialectic&lt;/a&gt; between these two momentums has to give birth to the \u00abnew child\u00bb of the new era, the &lt;a href=\"world%20community\"&gt;world community&lt;/a&gt;.\nNovelty depends upon the womb of necessity. No wonder if there is the darkness on the intermediate stages of its birth. As &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Bloch\"&gt;Ernst Bloch&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"at the foot of the lighthouse, there is not light\".(in \"La terra del tramonto\")"
