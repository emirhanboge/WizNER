He graduated from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Idaho\"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;Bachelor of Science&lt;/a&gt; degree in &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;, and was commissioned as an &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;ensign&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Reserve%20Officers%20Training%20Corps\"&gt;Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps&lt;/a&gt; on January 23, 1970. He attended pilot training in &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Pensacola, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and was designated a &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Aviator\"&gt;Naval Aviator&lt;/a&gt; on November 23, 1971. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20junior%20grade\"&gt;lieutenant junior grade&lt;/a&gt; in December 1971, and was subsequently granted an inter-service transfer to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;United States Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt; in 1972.\nMarine career.\nJoining Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 212 (&lt;a href=\"VMFA-212\"&gt;VMFA-212&lt;/a&gt;) in the spring of 1972, Amos's ensuing operational assignments included tours with &lt;a href=\"VMFA-235\"&gt;VMFA-235&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"VMFA-232\"&gt;VMFA-232&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"VMFA-122\"&gt;VMFA-122&lt;/a&gt;, where he flew the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II\"&gt;F-4 Phantom II&lt;/a&gt;. In the fall of 1978, Amos left the active Marine Corps to become a commercial pilot for &lt;a href=\"Braniff%20International%20Airways\"&gt;Braniff International Airways&lt;/a&gt;. He was employed with Braniff for 25 months, returning to the Marine Corps in January 1981.\nAfter a three-year posting as a flight instructor in advanced jet training, attendance at the &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Forces%20Staff%20College\"&gt;Armed Forces Staff College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as a major, and a 13-month overseas staff assignment to the &lt;a href=\"III%20Marine%20Amphibious%20Force\"&gt;III Marine Amphibious Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, Amos was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2024\"&gt;Marine Aircraft Group 24&lt;/a&gt;, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he assumed command of Marine Air Base Squadron 24, later re-designated as Marine Wing Support Squadron 173. Joining VMFA-212, in 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Amos deployed to the Western Pacific as the squadron's executive officer for what would be called \"Operation Last Dance,\" the last overseas deployment of the Marine F-4 Phantom before it was phased out and retired.\nTransitioning to the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1990, Amos assumed command of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 312 &lt;a href=\"VMFA-312\"&gt;VMFA-312&lt;/a&gt;, and took delivery of 12 new &lt;a href=\"F/A-18C\"&gt;F/A-18C&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, becoming the Marine Corps\u2019 first single-seat Night Attack Hornet squadron. In the summer of 1992, he and his squadron joined &lt;a href=\"Carrier%20Air%20Wing%20Eight\"&gt;Carrier Air Wing Eight&lt;/a&gt; on board the . The squadron's strong performance was recognized in 1993 with the awarding of the Marine Corps Aviation Association's Hanson Trophy, recognizing 312 as the Marine Corps' top fighter/attack squadron. Following a two-year staff instructor assignment at &lt;a href=\"Quantico%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Quantico, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, where he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Colonel\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt;, Amos took command of &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2031\"&gt;Marine Aircraft Group 31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beaufort%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Beaufort, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in May 1996.\nPromoted to brigadier general in 1998, Amos was assigned to NATO as the Deputy Commander, Naval Striking Forces, Southern Europe in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, Italy. During this tour, he commanded NATO's Kosovo Verification and Coordination Center in &lt;a href=\"Skopje%2C%20Macedonia\"&gt;Skopje, Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, and later served as the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Joint Task Force Noble Anvil during the air campaign over Yugoslavia and Kosovo. Transferred to the Pentagon in the summer of 2000, Amos' other one-star assignments included posting as the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Aviation in 2000, and the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies and Operations in 2001.\nIn August 2002, Amos was promoted to major general and assumed command of the 15,000 Marines of the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Marine%20Aircraft%20Wing\"&gt;3rd Marine Aircraft Wing&lt;/a&gt; based out of &lt;a href=\"Miramar%2C%20California\"&gt;Miramar, California&lt;/a&gt;, leading them in combat twice between 2003 and 2004 during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Iraqi%20Freedom\"&gt;Operations Iraqi Freedom I and II&lt;/a&gt;. Receiving his third star in 2004, Lieutenant General Amos assumed command of the 45,000+ Marines and sailors of the II Marine Expeditionary Force at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lejeune\"&gt;Camp Lejeune&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina. In 2006, he was reassigned as the commanding general, Marine Corps' Combat Development Command, and as the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration, at &lt;a href=\"Quantico%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Quantico, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, where he was responsible for the training of all Marines, their combat units, their continuing education, and for the identification of all Marine equipment requirements.\nReceiving his fourth star in July 2008, Amos assumed duties as the 31st &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;, based at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. In June 2010, Amos was recommended &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gates\"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; for nomination as the 35th &lt;a href=\"Commandant%20of%20the%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Commandant of the Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;. Amos was nominated by President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; on July 20, who interviewed him for the job on June 17. and confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services\"&gt;Senate Armed Services Committee&lt;/a&gt; on September 21, and confirmed shortly thereafter. On October 22, 2010, in a ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Marine%20Barracks%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, Amos assumed the position as Commandant. This marked the first time a Marine aviator had held the position of Commandant, and the first time since 1983 that a sitting Assistant Commandant had moved up to become Commandant.\nDuring his tenure as Commandant, Amos completed the Corps' combat mission in Afghanistan. Facing sequestration and the significant effects of the Budget Control Act, he fought to re-balance the Corps during the period of marked fiscal austerity, all while ensuring the combat readiness of the Marine Corps for its continued role as our nation's Expeditionary Crisis Response Force. Responding to multiple global challenges that had been critically acclaimed as \"the new normal,\" he established Special Purpose \u2013 Marine Air Ground Task Force-Crisis Response commands in both Africa and the Middle East, while adding 1,000 Marine Security Guards to America's embassies around the world. Additionally, during his final two years as Commandant, he shepherded the Corps' considerable efforts to address head-on its many challenges in recruiting and maintaining a diverse and talented body of Marines. Lastly, he significantly raised the requirements and capacity within the Marine Corps University for all Marines to attend resident Professional Military Education.\nOn October 17, 2014, at Marine Corps Barracks Washington, Amos relinquished command to General &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Dunford\"&gt;Joseph Dunford&lt;/a&gt;, who became the 36th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Secretary of the Navy &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Mabus\"&gt;Ray Mabus&lt;/a&gt; awarded Amos the &lt;a href=\"Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal\"&gt;Navy Distinguished Service Medal&lt;/a&gt; for his service as commandant and Secretary of Defense &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Hagel\"&gt;Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt; awarded him with the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal\"&gt;Defense Distinguished Service Medal&lt;/a&gt; for over 42 years of distinguished service.\nAmos retired from active duty on 1 December 2014.\nTenure as Commandant.\nF-35B, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).\nIn November 2010, shortly after becoming commandant, Amos, along with the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations\"&gt;Chief of Naval Operations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, were notified of an over $4 billion shortfall in the JSF Program. Reacting to this and the steadily rising costs and delays in the program, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called a meeting with Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Amos, ostensibly to cancel the Marine variant, the F-35B. Amos was successful in convincing Gates of the Corps' need for the aircraft, choosing rather to place the F-35B on a two-year probation to allow the program to mature and right itself. Amos' detailed and hands-on actions over the next 18 months ensured positive progress on the Marine variant in most areas of concern, resulting in Secretary &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Panetta\"&gt;Leon Panetta&lt;/a&gt; removing the F-35B from probation six months early. As a result, the Marine Corps was the first service to be able to stand up and operationally certify a Joint Strike Fighter squadron within the DoD.\nShipbuilding and amphibious ships.\nAfter a decade plus of declining amphibious ship numbers in the U.S. Navy inventory, and increasing operational requirements for Marines around the world, Amos partnered with the Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy Secretariat, and industry to reconfirm amphibious ship requirements, acceptable readiness levels, and total hull numbers. Working closely with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;, in the Senate and the House over two years of budgetary efforts, Congress authorized and appropriated monies to buy a, not-programmed, 12th San Antonio Class LPD amphibious war ship. Additionally, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Chief of Naval Operations, the Secretary of the Navy, and Amos agreeing to recapitalizing the Navy's more than 40-year-old LSD amphibious ships with the new, and proven, San Antonio Class hull design. This single agreement alone will result in millions of dollars saved over the lifetime of the LSD replacement effort, and will accelerate the completion and delivery of the ships years ahead of schedule.\nMontford Point Marines and the Congressional Gold Medal.\nIn 2012, Amos partnered with key legislators In the US House and US Senate to bring national recognition to the service and sacrifices of the Corps' African American &lt;a href=\"Montford%20Point%20Marine%20Association\"&gt;Montford Point Marines&lt;/a&gt; with the awarding of the &lt;a href=\"Congressional%20Gold%20Medal\"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt;. African-American men were recruited into the Marine Corps under President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;'s orders beginning in 1942. Establishing a &lt;a href=\"Racial%20segregation\"&gt;segregated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Recruit%20Training\"&gt;boot camp&lt;/a&gt; on a swampy point of land in &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Jacksonville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; known as Montford Point, the Marine Corps trained some 20,000 African American men between 1942 and 1949. Commandant of the Marine Corps, General &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Vandegrift\"&gt;Alexander Vandegrift&lt;/a&gt;, closed down the segregated training in 1949, stating \"The experiment with the negro Marines is over. They are Marines \u2026Period!\" The Montford Point Marines served in the Pacific during WWII, and again in 1951 during the Korean War. Their unique service to the United States had never been recognized at the national level until Amos initiated efforts to have them awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Final authorization was signed and the medal struck on November 23, 2011, recognizing the Montford Point Marines.\nRevising Marine Corps ethics.\nSensing that 10 years of sustained combat may have begun fraying the edges of the Corps' moral fabric, Amos initiated an effort to morally and ethically \"reground the Corps.\" The effort, named the \"Reawakening\", targeted the Corps' central leadership cadre, the Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO). Amos and &lt;a href=\"Micheal%20Barrett\"&gt;Sergeant Major Micheal Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, spent the better part of 2013 traveling to most every Marine base to personally challenge the Corps' NCO leadership with getting back to the basics. The sole focus of the Reawakening was simply to remind Marines of their higher calling. Amos reinforced \"who they were\" as Marines, \"what they did for the nation\", and \"who they were not\".\nRepeal of don't ask, don't tell.\nAs Commandant, Amos opposed the repeal of the \"&lt;a href=\"don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell\"&gt;don't ask, don't tell&lt;/a&gt;\" policy regarding &lt;a href=\"homosexuality\"&gt;homosexuals&lt;/a&gt; openly serving in the U.S. military. After President Obama signed the legislation setting the conditions for repeal, Amos led the Department of Defense in carrying out the will of the nation's civilian leadership. In late November 2011, Amos stated that his opposition to gays openly serving in the military has proven unfounded and said that Marines have embraced the change, describing the repeal as a \"non-event.\"\nPersonal life.\nAmos graduated from the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Forces%20Staff%20College\"&gt;Armed Forces Staff College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Air%20War%20College\"&gt;Air War College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Maxwell Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince retiring from the Marine Corps, Amos has joined the board of directors of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Corporation\"&gt;Lord Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a defense contractor. He currently serves as chairman of the board of the &lt;a href=\"Semper%20Fi%20Fund\"&gt;Semper Fi Fund&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2017, Amos was found guilty of Unlawful Command Influence by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Appeals Court in unanimous ruling of 3-0 regarding the prosecution of Marines involved in 2011 Taliban corpse desecration case.\nAwards and decorations.\nAmos holds the rifle sharpshooter and several awards of the pistol expert &lt;a href=\"Marksmanship%20Badge%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;marksmanship badges&lt;/a&gt;."
