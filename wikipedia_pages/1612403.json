The couple remained married until his death in 1965. The union was childless.\nGerson retired in 1966, though still using her voice, working at the telephone answering service of her second husband, Louis R. \"Lou\" Lauria, to whom she was married from 1966 until his death in 1994. That union was also childless.\nShe was honored as a &lt;a href=\"Disney%20Legends\"&gt;Disney Legend&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. She returned to films one last time in 1997, providing the voice of Frances in \"&lt;a href=\"Cats%20Don%27t%20Dance\"&gt;Cats Don't Dance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDeath.\nGerson died from a stroke in Los Angeles on January 12, 1999, at the age of 84."
