    "text": "State Route\u00a0676 (SR\u00a0676) is a long east\u2013west &lt;a href=\"state%20highway\"&gt;state highway&lt;/a&gt; in the southeastern portion of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. The western terminus of SR\u00a0676 is at a T-intersection with &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%20555\"&gt;SR\u00a0555&lt;/a&gt; approximately southeast of the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chesterhill%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Chesterhill&lt;/a&gt;. Its eastern terminus is at a T-intersection with &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%207\"&gt;SR\u00a07&lt;/a&gt; in the southwestern portion of the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marietta%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marietta&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoute description.\nSR\u00a0676 traverses the western portion of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Washington County&lt;/a&gt; and a small portion of southern &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Morgan County&lt;/a&gt;. There are no segments of SR\u00a0676 that are a part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt; (NHS), a network of route determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.\nHistory.\nThe SR\u00a0676 designation was established in 1937. It has utilized the same routing between SR\u00a0555 near Chesterhill and SR\u00a07 near Marietta throughout its history. Initially, the entire length of SR\u00a0676 was a gravel roadway. In 1947, the easternmost stretch of SR\u00a0676 between County Road\u00a0183 (CR\u00a0183) and SR\u00a07 was paved. Four years later, the highway was hard-surfaced between the present &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%20339\"&gt;SR\u00a0339&lt;/a&gt; junction, at the time designated as SR\u00a076, and CR\u00a0183. The remaining gravel portion of SR\u00a0676 between SR\u00a0555 and the current SR\u00a0339 intersection was paved by 1961."
