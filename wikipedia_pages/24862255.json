    "text": "Craig A. Kraft (born Craig Allan Kraft; born on December 7, 1949) is an American sculptor. Over the course of his career, Kraft has gained national recognition for his &lt;a href=\"neon\"&gt;neon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; works, establishing him as one of the leading neon sculptors of today. In his earlier works, such as \"Seated/Unseated Woman\" and \"Light Figure Fragment,\" Kraft rendered sculptures incorporating details in neon. Since 2000, the main focus of Kraft's art has been privately commissioned pieces, such as \"Connective Ascension\", and monumental &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; works, such as \"Lightweb\" in Downtown &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Silver Spring, MD&lt;/a&gt;, that are &lt;a href=\"Abstract%20Art\"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; pieces made from rolled aluminum and neon tubing.\nKraft's sculptures have been featured in over 120 &lt;a href=\"Art%20exhibitions\"&gt;exhibits&lt;/a&gt; throughout the United States, including fifteen &lt;a href=\"Solo%20show%20%28art%20exhibition%29\"&gt;solo exhibitions&lt;/a&gt;, fifteen &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; installations, and in various international art exhibitions. He has twice been featured as an artist at the International Sculpture Conference and has been a member of the faculty of the &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian%20Institution\"&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt; Institution Studio Arts Program since 1992. His work has been published in over 25 books, magazine articles, and newspaper articles. His work can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Collection%20%28museum%29%23Types\"&gt;permanent collection&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Neon%20Art\"&gt;Museum of Neon Art (MONA)&lt;/a&gt;.\nCraig Kraft is known for working from his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Station\"&gt;firehouse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"studio\"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;. The firehouse, formerly &lt;a href=\"Engine%20House%20No.%207%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Engine House No. 7&lt;/a&gt;, is a historic property in Washington that boasts having been home to the first all-black fire company in the District. He currently runs a studio out of &lt;a href=\"Anacostia\"&gt;Anacostia&lt;/a&gt; Washington D.C.\nArtistic career.\nEarly life and education/training.\nCraig Kraft was born on December 7, 1949 in &lt;a href=\"Ames%2C%20Iowa\"&gt;Ames, IA&lt;/a&gt;. During college and graduate school, Kraft's interests laid primarily in the &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;s. As a student at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt;, Kraft received his B.S. in &lt;a href=\"zoology\"&gt;zoology&lt;/a&gt; in 1971, followed by an M.A. in &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Education\"&gt;Environmental Education and Science&lt;/a&gt; in 1974. It was not until two years after he finished his master's degree that Kraft began developing his skills as a &lt;a href=\"visual%20art\"&gt;visual art&lt;/a&gt;ist. In 1976 Kraft moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans, LA&lt;/a&gt;, and started to model, &lt;a href=\"Casting%20%28metalworking%29\"&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt;, and paint the &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;. Neon was not included as a medium in his works until 1983 when Kraft began attending classes at the newly opened American School of Neon in &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis, MN&lt;/a&gt;, which taught working with neon not as a commercial tool but as a means of artistic expression. In 1989 he studied at the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Center%20for%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Atlantic Center for the Arts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Smyrna%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;New Smyrna Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Antonakos\"&gt;Stephen Antonakos&lt;/a&gt;, whom Kraft still considers one of his major influences.\nPhilosophy.\nCraig Kraft's &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; towards making art lies in his belief that a piece of art must work synergistically with its site; art and architecture must function together in harmony. He believes that an artist must consider the site the same way in which he views the art, for every place he puts an object affects how others view it just as much as the appearance of the object itself. As such, art must grow organically from the site, incorporating the different elements of the architecture aesthetically as well as culturally. In his own words, Kraft is \u201cinspired by the site in public art and by close examination of form, color, and light in general. Works are made from scratch\u2014little preconceived notions about the final outcomes. [I work with] one decision leading to another, always looking ahead as to how all the media (the aluminum, the neon, and the surroundings) work together as a whole.\"\nTeaching.\nAfter spending a nearly a decade learning to use neon in the service of art, Kraft began to spend some of his time &lt;a href=\"Teacher\"&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt; others the craft of neon. While many artists resist sharing their specific (and often secret) techniques to others, Kraft has always enjoyed teaching eager students the skills and perspectives that he has gained over the years. Since 1992 Kraft has been a member of the faculty of the Smithsonian Institution Studio Arts Program and has offered private neon &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;s at his studio.\nArtistic style.\nKraft's work is best described as &lt;a href=\"Abstract%20Art\"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; in style with references to the &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; in general. While some believe that his greatest influences are \"the illuminated works of Cork Marcheschi, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Antonakos\"&gt;Stephen Antonakos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Flavin\"&gt;Dan Flavin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Sonnier\"&gt;Keith Sonnier&lt;/a&gt;,\" Kraft believes that the real impetus for his work to be the unique desire and structural challenge to fully integrate architecture with art.\nWorks.\nEarly works.\nIn the beginning of his career, Kraft worked with modeling the &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, using traditional methods and traditional subjects. But, by the early 1980s he began to find his work becoming monotonous, and looked towards the newly opened American School of Neon in &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis, MN&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration. The philosophy of the school was to treat neon as a &lt;a href=\"Sculpture\"&gt;sculptural&lt;/a&gt; medium rather than merely a medium for &lt;a href=\"Neon%20sign\"&gt;commercial signage&lt;/a&gt;. Kraft was able to manipulate the neon in order to integrate it with his fragmented, sequenced &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figurative&lt;/a&gt; work. The colored lights added a certain volume, experience, and mood to the work that Kraft found previously lacking.\nMany of these early works feature sections of &lt;a href=\"Orthopedic%20cast\"&gt;plaster casts&lt;/a&gt; of models attached to &lt;a href=\"canvas\"&gt;canvas&lt;/a&gt;, backlit with neon. Kraft enjoyed \"the personal aspect of &lt;a href=\"Orthopedic%20cast%23Body%20casts\"&gt;body casting&lt;/a&gt;, and the shared beauty of the certain aspect of the human form and condition.\" The neon tubing is often concealed in his sculptures, either by hiding the tube within the cast or by painting the tube black and scratching out sections of paint to direct the flow of light onto the &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;, giving the sculpture the appearance of a mysterious colored glow. Of Kraft's early work, \"a common theme\u2026a theme that immediately holds a peruser's eyes hostage\u2014is the seemingly partial emergence of a &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;human figure&lt;/a&gt; from the canvas, made all the more captivating by the strategically placed neon backlighting that appears to serve as the portal for the &lt;a href=\"Relief\"&gt;bas-relief&lt;/a&gt; segment of the work.\"\nKraft is currently \u201cone of only a handful of light artists in the world who bends his own glass and is respected for his ability to precisely manipulate the &lt;a href=\"Figurative%20art\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; and light to capture his own artistic vision.\"\nCareer.\nKrafts career then dove into an 8-year inquiry into the universal urge to connect through mark making.\u00a0 It started in 2009 with a series called Unintentional Drawings and progressed to the omnipresent &lt;a href=\"graffiti\"&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; on the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Ground%20Zero%20Blues%20Club\"&gt;Ground Zero Blues Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Clarksdale%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Clarksdale&lt;/a&gt; Mississippi.\u00a0\nThis urge to mark inspired him to travel to 3 continents and visit 27 ancient cave sites in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Europe\"&gt;Southern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to view, first hand, the first drawings, paintings, and etchings made by early &lt;a href=\"homo%20sapiens\"&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/a&gt; from up to 40,000 BC. He was particularly drawn to what are referred to as \"signs\" or &lt;a href=\"symbol\"&gt;symbol&lt;/a&gt;s which may be the earliest known marks of all. The experiences that he had within the caves has led his artistic career to investigate modern and ancient symbols as well as paint and draw images combined with the same type of flickering light- dots and hand stencils.\nIn 2017 he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Kalahari%20Desert\"&gt;Kalahari Desert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, where he met the &lt;a href=\"San%20people\"&gt;Sans&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest indigenous group in the world. Months after returning from Africa, Kraft realized that the &lt;a href=\"safari\"&gt;safari&lt;/a&gt; directly exposed him to the sacred animals which the Sans had worshipped. The most powerful to him was the elephant.\u00a0 He then proceeded to sculpt, in light, the spirit of the African elephant-half size- in a light blue-silvery neon. During this creative process, the spirit of the African elephant evolved into the Damaged spirit of the African elephant, visually illustrating the horrific &lt;a href=\"poaching\"&gt;poaching&lt;/a&gt; of elephants tusks occurring around the world.\nPublic art.\nWhen asked why he began to work in large-scale &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; local news reporter &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Morris%20%28Television%20Reporter%29\"&gt;Holly Morris&lt;/a&gt;, Kraft responded that he wanted to be able to &lt;a href=\"drawing\"&gt;draw&lt;/a&gt; on buildings with neon, and that when drawing in space with light one needs to be able to work much larger. Many of his &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; pieces appear to do just this. \"Lightweb\", arguably Kraft's most famous work, installed on an external &lt;a href=\"elevator\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Silver Spring, MD&lt;/a&gt;, features green, red, and blue colored tubes that extend from its architectural base into the air to create a 35' by 10' by 10' light drawing in the night sky. \"Lightweb\" was commissioned by the local &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland%23Law%20and%20government\"&gt;Montgomery County Government&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. \"Vivace,\" another one of Kraft's renowned public works which was commissioned by the city of Washington DC for the &lt;a href=\"Watha%20T.%20Daniel\"&gt;Watha T Daniel&lt;/a&gt; Library. This Sculpture is 21' x 14' x 7' and made of rolled painted aluminum, neon, and steel.\nKraft's combination of rolled aluminum tubing and neon functions well for an outdoor setting, for he is able to use the aluminum to protect the neon's wiring from the elements, whether these pieces are attached to buildings or are freestanding. Some critics have questioned whether neon, a material traditionally associated with nighttime viewing, functions well for &lt;a href=\"public%20art\"&gt;public art&lt;/a&gt; viewed during the &lt;a href=\"daytime%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;daytime&lt;/a&gt;. However other art critics believe that Kraft's most recent neon works, which incorporate aluminum tubes painted in a vibrant &lt;a href=\"powder%20coating\"&gt;powder coating&lt;/a&gt;, appear just as bold during the &lt;a href=\"daytime%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;daytime&lt;/a&gt; as during the night."
