    "text": "Etosha National Park is a national park in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and one of the largest national parks in Africa. It was proclaimed a game reserve in March 1907 in Ordinance 88 by the Governor of &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20von%20Lindequist\"&gt;Friedrich von Lindequist&lt;/a&gt;. It was designated as \"Wildschutzgebiet\" in 1958, and was elevated to the status of a national park in 1967 by an act of parliament of the Republic of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It spans an area of and gets its name from the large &lt;a href=\"Etosha%20pan\"&gt;Etosha pan&lt;/a&gt; which is almost entirely within the park. With an area of , the Etosha pan covers 23% of the total area of the national park. The area is home to hundreds of species of mammals, birds and reptiles, including several &lt;a href=\"Threatened%20species\"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; species such as the &lt;a href=\"black%20rhinoceros\"&gt;black rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe park is located in the &lt;a href=\"Kunene%20Region\"&gt;Kunene region&lt;/a&gt; and shares boundaries with the regions of &lt;a href=\"Oshana\"&gt;Oshana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oshikoto%20Region\"&gt;Oshikoto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Otjozondjupa\"&gt;Otjozondjupa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDiscovery by Europeans.\nExplorers &lt;a href=\"Charles%20John%20Andersson\"&gt;Charles John Andersson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Galton\"&gt;Francis Galton&lt;/a&gt; were the first Europeans to record the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Etosha%20pan\"&gt;Etosha pan&lt;/a&gt; on 29 May 1851. The explorers were traveling with &lt;a href=\"Ovambo%20people\"&gt;Ovambo&lt;/a&gt; copper ore traders when they arrived at Omutjamatunda (now known as Namutoni). The Etosha pan was discovered when they traveled north upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Namutoni\"&gt;Namutoni&lt;/a&gt;. The name Etosha (spelled Etotha in early literature) comes from &lt;a href=\"Oshindonga\"&gt;Oshindonga&lt;/a&gt; word meaning \"Great White Place\" referring to the Etosha pan. The &lt;a href=\"Hai//om\"&gt;Hai//om&lt;/a&gt; called the pan \"Khubus\" which means \"totally bare, white place with lots of dust\". The pan is also known as \"Chums\", which refers to the noise made by a person's feet when walking on the clay of the pan.\nPeople.\nAreas north of the Etosha pan were inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Ovambo%20people\"&gt;Ovambo people&lt;/a&gt;, while various &lt;a href=\"Herero%20language\"&gt;Otjiherero-speaking&lt;/a&gt; groups lived immediately outside the current park boundaries. The areas inside the park close to the Etosha pan had &lt;a href=\"Khoisan\"&gt;Khoisan&lt;/a&gt;-speaking &lt;a href=\"Hai//om\"&gt;Hai//om&lt;/a&gt; people.\nWhen the Etosha pan was first discovered, the Hai//om people recognized the Ovambo chief at &lt;a href=\"Ondonga\"&gt;Ondonga&lt;/a&gt; but the &lt;a href=\"Herero%20people\"&gt;Hereros&lt;/a&gt; did not. The Hai||om were forcibly removed from the park in the 1954, ending their hunter-gatherer lifestyle to become landless farm laborers. The Hai||om have had a recognized \"Traditional Authority\" since 2004 which helps facilitate communications between the community and the government. The government of Namibia acknowledges the park to be the home of Hai||om people and has plans to resettle displaced families on farms adjacent to the national park. Since 2007 the Government has acquired six farms directly south of the Gobaub depression in Etosha National Park. A number of families have settled on these farms under the leadership of Chief David Khamuxab, Paramount Chief of the Hai||om.\nEuropean settlers.\nIn 1885, entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"William%20Worthington%20Jordan\"&gt;William Worthington Jordan&lt;/a&gt; bought a huge tract of land from Ovambo chief Kambonde. The land spanned nearly from &lt;a href=\"Okaukuejo\"&gt;Okaukuejo&lt;/a&gt; in the west to &lt;a href=\"Fischer%27s%20Pan\"&gt;Fischer's Pan&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The price for the land was \u00a3300 sterling, paid for by 25 firearms, one salted horse and a cask of brandy. &lt;a href=\"Dorsland%20Trek\"&gt;Dorstland Trekkers&lt;/a&gt; first traveled through the park between 1876 and 1879 on their way to Angola. The trekkers returned in 1885 and settled on farms given to them at no charge by Jordan. The trekkers named the area &lt;a href=\"Upingtonia\"&gt;Upingtonia&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Upington\"&gt;the Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Colony\"&gt;Cape Colony&lt;/a&gt;. The settlement had to be abandoned in 1886 after clashes with the Hai||om and defeat by &lt;a href=\"Nehale%20Mpingana\"&gt;Chief Nehale Mpingana&lt;/a&gt;.\nGerman South-West Africa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"German%20Reich\"&gt;German Reich&lt;/a&gt; ordered troops to occupy the &lt;a href=\"Okaukuejo\"&gt;Okaukuejo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namutoni\"&gt;Namutoni&lt;/a&gt; and Sesfontein in 1886 in order to kill migrating wildlife to stop spread of &lt;a href=\"rinderpest\"&gt;rinderpest&lt;/a&gt; to cattle. A fort was built by the German cavalry in 1889 at the site of the Namutoni spring. On 28 January 1904, 500 men under &lt;a href=\"Nehale%20Mpingana\"&gt;Nehale Mpingana&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Germany&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Schutztruppe\"&gt;Schutztruppe&lt;/a&gt;\" at Fort Namutoni and completely destroyed it, driving out the colonial forces and taking over their horses and cattle. The fort was rebuilt and troops stationed once again when the area was declared a game reserve in 1907; Lieutenant Adolf Fischer of Fort Namutoni then became its first \"game warden\".\nBoundary.\nThe present-day Etosha National Park has had many major and minor boundary changes since its inception in 1907. The major boundary changes since 1907 were because of Ordinance 18 of 1958 and Ordinance 21 of 1970.\nWhen the Etosha area was proclaimed as \"Game Reserve 2\" by Ordinance 88 of 1907, the park stretched from the mouths of the &lt;a href=\"Cunene%20River\"&gt;Cunene River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hoarusib%20River\"&gt;Hoarusib River&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Coast\"&gt;Skeleton Coast&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Namutoni\"&gt;Namutoni&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The original area was estimated to be , an estimate that has been corrected to about . Ordinance 18 of 1958 changed the western park boundaries to exclude the area between the &lt;a href=\"Cunene%20river\"&gt;Cunene river&lt;/a&gt; and the Hoarusib river and instead include the area between &lt;a href=\"Hoanib\"&gt;Hoanib&lt;/a&gt; river and &lt;a href=\"Uchab\"&gt;Uchab&lt;/a&gt; river, thus reducing the park's area to . The &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Odendaal%23Odendaal%20Commission\"&gt;Odendaal Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s (1963) decision resulted in the demarcation of the present-day park boundary in 1970.\nEtosha Ecological Institute.\nThe Etosha Ecological Institute was formally opened on 1 April 1974 by &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Brinkmann\"&gt;Adolf Brinkmann&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South-West%20Africa\"&gt;South-West Africa&lt;/a&gt;n Administration. The institute is responsible for all management-related research in the park. Classification of vegetation, population and ecological studies on wildebeest, elephants and lions, and studies on &lt;a href=\"anthrax\"&gt;anthrax&lt;/a&gt; were among the first major topics to be investigated. The EEI has collaborations with researchers from universities in Namibia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Australia, Norway and Israel.\nGeography.\nEtosha Pan.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Salt%20pan%20%28geology%29\"&gt;salt pans&lt;/a&gt; are the most noticeable geological features in the national park. The main &lt;a href=\"Depression%20%28geology%29\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; covers an area of about , and is roughly long and as wide as places. The hypersaline conditions of the pan limit the species that can permanently inhabit the pan itself; occurrences of extremophile micro-organisms are present, which species can tolerate the hypersaline conditions. The salt pan is usually dry, but fills with water briefly in the summer, when it attracts &lt;a href=\"pelican\"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flamingo\"&gt;flamingo&lt;/a&gt;s in particular. In the &lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;dry season&lt;/a&gt;, winds blowing across the salt pan pick up saline dust and carry it across the country and out over the southern &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;. This salt enrichment provides minerals to the soil downwind of the pan on which some wildlife depends, though the salinity also creates challenges to farming. The Etosha Pan was one of several sites throughout &lt;a href=\"southern%20Africa\"&gt;southern Africa&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (&lt;a href=\"SAFARI%202000\"&gt;SAFARI 2000&lt;/a&gt;). Using satellites, aircraft, and ground-based data from sites such as Etosha, partners in this program collected a wide variety of data on &lt;a href=\"Particulate\"&gt;aerosols&lt;/a&gt;, land cover, and other characteristics of the land and &lt;a href=\"earth%27s%20atmosphere\"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; to study and understand the interactions between people and the &lt;a href=\"natural%20environment\"&gt;natural environment&lt;/a&gt;.\nDolomite Hills.\nThe dolomite hills on the southern border of the park near the Andersson entrance gate are called \"Ondundozonananandana\", meaning the place where young boy herding cattle went to never return, probably implying a high density of predators like leopards in the hills, giving the mountains its English name of Leopard Hills. The Halali area is also home to dolomite hills within the park, with one hill inside the camp and the nearby \"Twee Koppies\". Western Etosha is also dominated by dolomite hills which is the only place in the park that has &lt;a href=\"mountain%20zebra\"&gt;mountain zebra&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThe Etosha National Park has a savanna desert climate. The annual mean average temperature is . In winter, the mean nighttime lows are around , while in summer temperatures often hover around . As it is a desert, there is a large variation between day and night. Rain almost never falls in the winter.\nVegetation types.\nIn most places in the park, the pans are devoid of vegetation with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Halophyte\"&gt;halophytic&lt;/a&gt; \"Sporobolus salsus\", a protein-rich grass that is eaten by grazers like &lt;a href=\"blue%20wildebeest\"&gt;blue wildebeest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"springbok\"&gt;springbok&lt;/a&gt;. The areas around the &lt;a href=\"Etosha%20pan\"&gt;Etosha pan&lt;/a&gt; also have other halophytic vegetation including grasses like \"Sporobolus spicatus\" and \"Odyssea paucinervis\", as well as shrubs like \"Suaeda articulata\". Most of the park is savanna woodlands except for areas close to the pan. &lt;a href=\"Mopane\"&gt;Mopane&lt;/a&gt; is the most common tree, estimated to be around 80% of all trees in the park. The &lt;a href=\"Veld%23Sandveld\"&gt;sandveld&lt;/a&gt; of north-eastern corner of Etosha is dominated by &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Terminalia%20%28plant%29\"&gt;Terminalia&lt;/a&gt;\" trees. &lt;a href=\"Spirostachys%20africana\"&gt;Tamboti&lt;/a&gt; trees characterize the woodlands south of the sandveld. &lt;a href=\"Subshrub\"&gt;Dwarf shrub&lt;/a&gt; savanna occurs areas close to the pan and is home to several small shrubs including a halophytic succulent \"Salsola etoshensis\". Thorn bush savanna occurs close to the pan on limestone and alkaline soils and is dominated by &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt; species such as \"Acacia nebrownii\", \"Acacia luederitzii\", \"Acacia melliferra\", \"Acacia hebeclada\" and \"Acacia tortilis\". Grasslands in the park are mainly around the Etosha pan where the soil is sandy. Depending on the soil and the effects of the pan, grasslands could be dominated by one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Eragrostis\"&gt;Eragrostis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Sporobolus\"&gt;Sporobolus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Monelytrum\"&gt;Monelytrum&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Odyssea\"&gt;Odyssea&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Enneapogon\"&gt;Enneapogon&lt;/a&gt;\" species.\nFauna.\nThe park has about 114 mammal species, 340 bird species, 110 &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt; species, 16 &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt; species and 1 species of fish (up to 49 species of fish during floods).\nHistory.\nBy 1881, large game mammals like &lt;a href=\"African%20bush%20elephant\"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinoceroses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panthera%20leo%20melanochaita\"&gt;lions&lt;/a&gt; had been nearly exterminated in the region. The proclamation of the game reserve helped some of the animals recover, but some species like &lt;a href=\"African%20buffalo\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lycaon%20pictus\"&gt;wild dogs&lt;/a&gt; have been extinct since the middle of the 20th century. A writer from &lt;a href=\"Otjiwarongo\"&gt;Otjiwarongo&lt;/a&gt; was appointed game warden in 1951, and he considered the grasslands to be severely overgrazed. A bone meal plant was constructed near Rietfontein, and culling of &lt;a href=\"plains%20zebra\"&gt;zebras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20wildebeest\"&gt;wildebeests&lt;/a&gt; began in 1952. Official records indicate 293 zebras and 122 wildebeest were processed at the plant, but conservationists claimed thousands had been culled and successfully forced the plant's closure during the same year. The drought that began in the year 1980 resulted in the largest capture and culling operation in the history of the park. 2235 &lt;a href=\"mountain%20zebra\"&gt;mountain zebra&lt;/a&gt;s and 450 &lt;a href=\"plains%20zebra\"&gt;plains zebra&lt;/a&gt;s were captured, culled or sold. 525 &lt;a href=\"African%20elephant\"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt; were culled and processed at a temporary abattoir near Olifantsrus.\nSince 2005, the protected area is considered part of a &lt;a href=\"Panthera%20leo%20melanochaita\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt; Conservation Unit.\nMammals.\nCommonly seen mammals in the park, past and present, are listed in the table below\nBirds.\nThis overview is only one indication of the diversity of birds in the park and is not a complete list."
