His mother died in 1922, and his father subsequently married her brother's daughter. Frear was a distant relative of Robert Freer, who served as chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Trade%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;. One of three children, he received his early education at local public schools, and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Caesar%20Rodney%20High%20School\"&gt;Caesar Rodney High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1920.\nFrear studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Delaware\"&gt;University of Delaware&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newark%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Newark&lt;/a&gt;, where he received a bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1924. Following his graduation, he became operator of three farms and president of a retail business that distributed milk, fuel, farm machinery, and fertilizer. He served as commissioner of &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20State%20University\"&gt;Delaware State College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dover%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt; (1936\u20131941) and of the Delaware Old Age Welfare Commission (1938\u20131948). Also interested in banking, he was director (1938\u20131946) and chairman of the board (1946\u20131948) of the &lt;a href=\"Farm%20Credit%20System\"&gt;Federal Land Bank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, Maryland.

Douglass Buck&lt;/a&gt; in a close race.

Caleb Boggs&lt;/a&gt;. In all, he served in the Senate from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961. After he left the Senate, President &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; appointed him to the &lt;a href=\"Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission\"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, where he served from 1961 until 1963. Later he resumed his career in business and banking.\nDeath and legacy.\nFrear died at Dover and is buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery at Camden, Delaware. The J. Allen Frear Federal Building at 300 South New Street in Dover is named in his honor. There is also an Allen Frear Elementary School in Camden."
