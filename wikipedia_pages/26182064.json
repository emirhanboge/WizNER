He played 22 games, scored 12 tries (including a memorable length of the field try in Manly's 36\u201310 Minor Semi-final loss to &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Football%20Stadium\"&gt;Sydney Football Stadium&lt;/a&gt;), as well as winning both the &lt;a href=\"Dally%20M%20Awards\"&gt;Dally M&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Dally%20M%20Awards%20winners%231993\"&gt;Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and the Norwich Rising Star awards.\n1994 was a down year for Elsegood.

He would go on to play 77 games for the Roosters, crossing for 35 tries (10 more than at Manly).\nAfter 149 games in 8 seasons, Elsegood retired from playing rugby league at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2000%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2000 NRL season&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby League career highlights.\n\u2020 Did not play in Grand Final\nMotor racing.\nAfter retiring from football at the end of the 2000 season, he moved into property development and was a co-owner of Delmege Residential.
