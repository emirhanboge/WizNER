Established in 1922 as a &lt;a href=\"University-preparatory%20school\"&gt;preparatory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"feeder%20school\"&gt;feeder school&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20Ladies%27%20College%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, the school now caters for approximately 700 students from &lt;a href=\"Preschool%20education\"&gt;Pre-school&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Year%2012\"&gt;Year 12&lt;/a&gt;. Arden's first Year 12 class commenced in 2008. It used to be an only girls school in 1923 but 10 years later added the first ever boy and now it is a boys and girls school.\nArden Anglican College is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Primary%20School%20Heads%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Independent Primary School Heads of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (IPSHAA) and &lt;a href=\"Junior%20School%20Heads%20Association%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Junior School Heads Association of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the Association of Independent Co-Educational Schools, and the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales.\nHistory.\nBegan as a &lt;a href=\"Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;preparatory school&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20Ladies%27%20College%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney&lt;/a&gt; (PLC Sydney). The idea of a PLC Sydney preparatory school on the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20railway%20line%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;northern railway line&lt;/a&gt;, had first been suggested , however nothing came of these ideas then. On 23 February 1922, the PLC Council received a request from the Beecroft &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20Church%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; Congregation, that a primary school be established at &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Cheltenham&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, a sub-committee of the Council was formed to investigate its viability, and inspect a number of sites in Beecroft and &lt;a href=\"Pennant%20Hills\"&gt;Pennant Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Arden has been recently recognised as a leading sports school in the Hillzone sports for 2012.\nCouncil gave the committee power to open a preparatory school in the Beecroft Church Hall, to appoint a teacher-in-charge and to make any other arrangements necessary. By the April 1922 Council meeting, it was reported that the school had been opened at Beecroft with 13 female pupils, and with Eleanor Linck in charge. This school was named the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Beecroft and was to serve as an all-girls, primary feeder school for the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20Ladies%27%20College%2C%20Croydon\"&gt;Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the next few years enrolments grew and an assistant teacher was appointed. However, PLC Beecroft was not a financial success and Council enthusiasm began to wane. Linck tried her best to expand the school, suggesting that \"Romana House\" on Beecroft Road be purchased to allow for further enrolments, and that the house next door to the Church Hall be purchased so that &lt;a href=\"Boarding%20school\"&gt;boarders&lt;/a&gt; could be accommodated. Despite the school's strong number of enrolment application's, these requests were all declined.\nIn 1925, an additional teacher was appointed to teach &lt;a href=\"kindergarten\"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; and sport. It was reported that the local community was taking an interest in the new PLC, as that year two prizes had been presented to the school by the Beecroft School of Arts for library proficiency, and the Beecroft Presbyterian Women's Guild presented a prize for &lt;a href=\"Scripture\"&gt;Scripture&lt;/a&gt;. In 1926, Mrs Linck resigned to take up a position at the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20Ladies%27%20College%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, and Mrs Lucy I. Ritter was appointed head. Later that year, two council members suggested that a house be purchased to expand the school and widen its &lt;a href=\"tuition\"&gt;tuition&lt;/a&gt; scope, however again nothing came of this. Council now appeared to be uninterested in the Beecroft school.\nRitter, in the Assembly report for 1927, complained that \"Beecroft deserves more support from Presbyterians on the &lt;a href=\"Hornsby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Hornsby&lt;/a&gt; line.\" The school continued to make losses and so on 19 June 1929, Council decided that it was to be closed. Ritter, and the assistant teacher Ms Gurney, resigned in December of that year. In 1930, Gurney reopened the school in the Church Hall, which she named \"Arden\" after the &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespearean&lt;/a&gt; Forest of Peace in \"&lt;a href=\"As%20You%20Like%20It\"&gt;As You Like It&lt;/a&gt;\". The school flourished under her leadership.\nArden came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Sydney\"&gt;Anglican Diocesan&lt;/a&gt; Schools in 1946, and subsequently moved to St John's Beecroft Church Hall where it was named Arden Anglican College. The college moved again in 1952 to a house in Wongala Crescent, and in 1962, property was purchased on Beecroft Road.\nIn 2000, due to demand from the local community, preliminary plans for a secondary school at Arden began. The school purchased the former site of the \"Australian American International School\" at Oxford Street, Epping in 2001, and in 2003, the first year 7 class commenced at the new senior campus. Yearly expansion has continued since then, and concluded with the first Year 12 class graduating in 2008. 2008 also saw the opening of the Senior Studies Centre. Located directly opposite the secondary campus, it facilitates learning for year 11 and 12 (Preliminary and HSC) students in a \"corporate-style\" environment. In 2017, Arden announced a planned $21\u00a0million redevelopment of its Epping campus. In 2018, the Principal Graham Anderson signed a &lt;a href=\"petition\"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Sydney\"&gt;Anglican Diocese of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to retain s 38(3) in the \"&lt;a href=\"Sex%20Discrimination%20Act%201984\"&gt;Sex Discrimination Act 1984&lt;/a&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"Sex%20Discrimination%20Act%201984\"&gt;(Cth)&lt;/a&gt; which allows private religious schools to &lt;a href=\"Discrimination\"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against staff and students based on &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"petition\"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; it was argued that 'a more general right' to &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;religious freedom&lt;/a&gt; should exist, and the existing statutory 'exemptions should remain'.\nIn 2017, Arden announced a $21 million redevelopment of its Secondary Campus in Epping, to be finished in early 2020, in what would become known as 'Essex'. The new building accommodates:\nMotto.\nThe motto of Arden is 'In God My Joy'. The school encourages the students to show others the joy to be found by learning to put Jesus first in your life, to then consider the needs of others, as well as reflecting on developing yourself with God's guidance. It stresses upon putting Jesus first, others second, yourself third; and to wrestle at all times with Jesus' fabulous parable of the Good Samaritan: to love your neighbour as yourself; to care for \"The Other\"; to be inclusive of the broken, because we are beloved by God.\nGovernance.\nArden Anglican School is governed by the council. The Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney elects 10 persons for the council, along with the other persons appointed by the Archbishop.\nThe role of the council is to serve the Arden community by ensuring long term planning is undertaken, appropriate policies are implemented and that finances are managed in a prudent manner. The council also appoints the Principal. The day-to-day operations of the School are managed by the Principal in which they also report to the council. Council meet on the first Wednesday of each month during term time and there are three committees of the council:\nCampus.\nArden Anglican College is located on two campuses in the north-western suburbs of Sydney. The pre-school and primary School are situated in a &lt;a href=\"bushland\"&gt;bushland&lt;/a&gt; setting in Beecroft near Beecroft railway station on Wongala Crescent, while the secondary school is located from &lt;a href=\"Epping%20railway%20station%2C%20Sydney\"&gt;Epping railway station&lt;/a&gt;, in the suburb of Epping.\nCurriculum.\nThe primary school follows a curriculum mandated by the &lt;a href=\"NSW%20Board%20of%20Studies\"&gt;NSW Board of Studies&lt;/a&gt;, and where required is tailored to meet the needs of individual students. Specialist teachers are used for subjects such as &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Education\"&gt;Physical Education&lt;/a&gt; (PE), Music, Art, French language, Science, Library, Computer and Problem Solving.\nThe secondary school also follows the Board of Studies curriculum. In 2008, the first year 12 class completed the NSW &lt;a href=\"Higher%20School%20Certificate%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Higher School Certificate&lt;/a&gt;.\nCo-curriculum.\nSport.\nArden offers sport to all year levels, and students may partake in house and inter school competitions.\nThrough Arden's membership of the &lt;a href=\"Junior%20School%20Heads%20Association%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Junior School Heads Association of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Primary students may represent the school in sports such as &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, swimming, &lt;a href=\"Cross%20country%20running\"&gt;cross-country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-ball\"&gt;T-ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"softball\"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minkey\"&gt;minkey&lt;/a&gt; (mini hockey), &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netball\"&gt;netball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20soccer\"&gt;women's soccer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecondary students may represent Arden in &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, basketball, soccer (indoor/outdoor), rugby, netball, athletics, cross-country, softball, hockey, in the HZSA (Hills Zone Sports Association).\nThere are three houses Jenolan, Birnam and Sherwood.\nEvery year there are various sporting events at the Beecroft campus including the swimming carnival, cross-country and athletics carnival.\nArts\nArden offers a wide range of performing arts opportunities.
