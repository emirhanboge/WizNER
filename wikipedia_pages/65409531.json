    "text": "Meenachullion is a &lt;a href=\"blanket%20bog\"&gt;blanket bog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20site\"&gt;Ramsar site&lt;/a&gt; and national nature reserve of approximately in &lt;a href=\"County%20Donegal\"&gt;County Donegal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nMeenachullion was legally protected as a national nature reserve by the Irish government in 1990. In 1990, the site was also declared &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20site\"&gt;Ramsar site&lt;/a&gt; number 475.\nMeenachullion is a lowland blanket bog, with vegetation that transitions into &lt;a href=\"fen\"&gt;fen&lt;/a&gt; and wet grassy &lt;a href=\"heath\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; as it meets the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Gubben%20Hill\"&gt;Gubben Hill&lt;/a&gt;. On the flat top of the Hill there are small, eroded areas of highland blanket bog. The reserve also includes a part of the headwaters of a &lt;a href=\"Gweebarra%20River\"&gt;Gweebarra River&lt;/a&gt; tributary. A number of bird species use the reserve as a breeding site, and a small flock of \"&lt;a href=\"Greater%20white-fronted%20goose\"&gt;Anser albifrons flavirostris&lt;/a&gt;\" overwinter on the reserve."
