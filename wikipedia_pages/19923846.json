    "text": "Sarangbang (\uc0ac\ub791\ubc29, \u820d\u5eca\u623f) is a room located in a Korean traditional &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"hanok\"&gt;hanok&lt;/a&gt;) which served as a man's room, used for studying, writing poetry, and leisure activities. The Koreans created the sarangbang strictly following the &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucianism&lt;/a&gt; principles of the &lt;a href=\"Joseon%20Dynasty\"&gt;Joseon Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. In lower-class homes, the sarangbang is located across from the women's space (&lt;a href=\"Anbang%20%28room%29\"&gt;anbang&lt;/a&gt;), separated with a hall called a &lt;a href=\"daecheong\"&gt;daecheong&lt;/a&gt;. One of the characteristics of the sarangbang is that it usually has a separate &lt;a href=\"study%20%28room%29\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; called a sarangchae. The sarangchae is forbidden to women and only men can enter it. "
