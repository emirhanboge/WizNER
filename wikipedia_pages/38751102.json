    "text": "Graphium tamerlana is a butterfly found in &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Swallowtail%20butterfly\"&gt;swallowtail&lt;/a&gt; family.\nDescription.\nIt is similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Iphiclides%20podalirius\"&gt;Iphiclides podalirius&lt;/a&gt;\". The black band at the apex of the cell of the forewing reaches only to the median vein, not extending beyond it to the hind angle, being exactly as in \"&lt;a href=\"Graphium%20alebion\"&gt;Graphium alebion&lt;/a&gt;\", but in contradistinction to this insect, the orange anal spot on the hindwing of is reduced to two small obscure dots.\nEtymology.\nIt was named to honour the Turkic ruler &lt;a href=\"Tamerlane\"&gt;Tamerlane&lt;/a&gt;."
