    "text": "William Wallace Suddarth, II (November 18, 1880 \u2013 March 15, 1971) was a &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minister%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;minister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; player.\nCollege.\nSuddarth attended &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt; from 1900 to 1905. He was &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28sports%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lineman%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;lineman&lt;/a&gt; on one of the school's best &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Bulldogs%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; teams in &lt;a href=\"1903%20Cumberland%20Bulldogs%20football%20team\"&gt;1903&lt;/a&gt;. That team beat &lt;a href=\"1903%20Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20football%20team\"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; and tied &lt;a href=\"John%20Heisman\"&gt;John Heisman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Clemson%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt;. In the tie with Clemson, the winning team was to be awarded the ball. Captain Suddarth wanted captain &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Sadler\"&gt;Hope Sadler&lt;/a&gt; of Clemson to get the ball, and Sadler insisted Suddarth should have it. Some ten minutes of bickering was resolved when the ball was given to patrolman Patrick J. Sweeney, for warning the media and fans to stay down in front and allow spectators to see the game. Suddarth was selected to &lt;a href=\"Nash%20Buckingham\"&gt;Nash Buckingham&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20All-Southern%20Team\"&gt;All-Southern team&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Memphis%20Commercial%20Appeal\"&gt;Memphis Commercial Appeal&lt;/a&gt;\". He was inducted into the Cumberland Sports Hall of Fame in 1977.\nMinistry.\nOrdained in 1906, he served churches in the Middle Tennessee area on a full-time basis from 1906-1957, and continued to preach on a supply basis after retirement."
