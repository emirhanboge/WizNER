The Andorran delegation consisted of three competitors, two in &lt;a href=\"alpine%20skiing\"&gt;alpine skiing&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cross-country skiing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Vidosa\"&gt;Roger Vidosa&lt;/a&gt; provided Andorra's best performance at these Games, with a 27th-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20slalom\"&gt;men's slalom alpine skiing&lt;/a&gt; event. As of these Games, Andorra has never won an Olympic medal.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Andorran%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;Andorran Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; was recognized by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; on 31 December 1974. They first participated in Olympic competition at the &lt;a href=\"1976%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1976 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and have taken part in every &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Summer&lt;/a&gt; and Winter Olympics since. Coming into 2006, Andorra had never won a medal in either the Summer or Winter Olympics. The Andorran delegation to Turin consisted of three competitors: alpine skiers &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Vidosa\"&gt;Roger Vidosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Antor\"&gt;Alex Antor&lt;/a&gt;, and cross-country skier &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Souli%C3%A9\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Souli\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Antor was the flag bearer for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Winter%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, while a ceremony volunteer carried the flag for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Winter%20Olympics%20closing%20ceremony\"&gt;closing ceremony&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlpine skiing.\nAlex Antor was 26 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and had previously represented &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;2002 Salt Lake Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Roger Vidosa was 21 at the time of these Games, and would later go on to represent &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;the nation&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Vancouver%20Olympics\"&gt;2010 Vancouver Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. On 12 February both competitors took part in the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20downhill\"&gt;men's downhill&lt;/a&gt;; Antor finished in a time of 1 minute and 55 seconds, which placed him 39th, and Vidosa completed the course in a time of 1 minute and 59 seconds, good for 50th place, out of 53 skiers to finish the race. The gold medal winning time was 1 minute and 48 seconds, put up by France's &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20D%C3%A9n%C3%A9riaz\"&gt;Antoine D\u00e9n\u00e9riaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 14 February, both men participated in the three-run &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20combined\"&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; event.

Vidosa finished the downhill run in 1 minute and 46 seconds, and the two slalom runs in 48 seconds and 47 seconds respectively. This meant his overall time was 3 minutes and 21 seconds for the three runs, which put him into 28th place, behind &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Ligety\"&gt;Ted Ligety&lt;/a&gt;'s gold medal time of 3 minutes and 9 seconds.\nAntor took part in the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20super-G\"&gt;super-G&lt;/a&gt; on 18 February, but failed to finish the race.

Antor failed to finish the first run, while Vidosa finished it in a time of 59.8 seconds. He would improve his time in the afternoon, completing his second run in 54.1 seconds. Vidosa's total time of 1 minute and 54 seconds placed him 27th, behind &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Raich\"&gt;Benjamin Raich&lt;/a&gt;'s gold medal winning time of 1 minute and 43 seconds.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom.\nCross-country skiing.\nFran\u00e7ois Souli\u00e9 was 27 years old at the time of these Olympics, and would represent Andorra again four years later in Vancouver.

Souli\u00e9 finished the first 15\u00a0km in a time of 45 minute and 19 seconds, but was unable to finish the rest of the race. Five days later, he finished the &lt;a href=\"Cross-country%20skiing%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%2015%20kilometre%20classical\"&gt;Men's 15 km classical&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 44 minutes and 42 seconds, ranking him 71st out of 96 classified finishers.
