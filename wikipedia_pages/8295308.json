    "text": "\"Dur dur d'\u00eatre b\u00e9b\u00e9 !\", which was retitled \"Dur dur d'\u00eatre b\u00e9b\u00e9! (It's Hard to Be a Baby)\" for its American audience, is a 1992 song recorded by &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; singer Jordy Lemoine, credited as &lt;a href=\"Jordy%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Jordy&lt;/a&gt;. The first &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; from his debut album \"Pochette surprise\", it was released in September 1992 and achieved success across the world, particularly in France. The single reached number-one in Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Greece and Spain.\nBackground.\nAfter having tried to involve Jordy in TV &lt;a href=\"advertisement\"&gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"nappies\"&gt;nappies&lt;/a&gt; where the baby should repeat \"hard, hard to be wet\", Claude Lemoine, Jordy's father, had the idea of using dance music and simple lyrics to create a catchy song. The result was well received in &lt;a href=\"discoth%C3%A8que\"&gt;discoth\u00e8que&lt;/a&gt;s, which convinced Lemoine to release it as a commercial single.\nCharts performance and records.\nBecause of this song, Jordy was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the youngest singer ever to reach number one on a singles chart. He achieved this feat in France in October 1992 at the age of four and a half, beating the previous world record held by &lt;a href=\"Osamu%20Minagawa\"&gt;Osamu Minagawa&lt;/a&gt; and French record held by &lt;a href=\"Elsa%20Lunghini\"&gt;Elsa Lunghini&lt;/a&gt;. Jordy was also the youngest artist to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number 58 with the song.\n\"Dur dur d'\u00eatre b\u00e9b\u00e9 !\" entered the French chart at number four on 26 September 1992, rose to number two for two weeks, and then topped the chart for 15 weeks, which was the record at the time. The previous record for the longest stretch atop the French chart had belonged to Images' \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20D%C3%A9mons%20de%20minuit\"&gt;Les D\u00e9mons de minuit&lt;/a&gt;\" (1986) and Licence IV's \"&lt;a href=\"Viens%20boire%20un%20p%27tit%20coup%20%C3%A0%20la%20maison\"&gt;Viens boire un p'tit coup \u00e0 la maison&lt;/a&gt;\" (1987), at 13 weeks apiece. Following its stay atop the chart, Jordy's single held the number two slot for another four weeks, eventually totalling 26 weeks in the French top ten and 30 weeks in the top 50. \"Dur dur d'\u00eatre b\u00e9b\u00e9!\" was also a dance hit across Europe, Latin America, Hong Kong and Japan. An English-language version and a mix version were also recorded and are available on the album \"&lt;a href=\"Pochette%20Surprise%20%28Surprise%20Package%29\"&gt;Pochette Surprise&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCritical reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"Here's an artist who can make the members of &lt;a href=\"Kris%20Kross\"&gt;Kris Kross&lt;/a&gt; look like old fogies.\" He added, \"Five-year-old rapper/singer from France has topped the charts in almost every country in the free world (and a few that aren't). The concept is simple: Jordy chirps and rhymes in French about the rigors of childhood over a bouncy pop/&lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; beat. Top 40 pundits who regularly indulge in wacky novelty items will be salivating after the first chorus.\" Troy J. Augusto from \"&lt;a href=\"Cashbox%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Cashbox&lt;/a&gt;\" said, \"Jordy, the hardest-working kindergartener in show biz. A novelty to be sure, his American intro is catchy enough that he may actually score a chart-topper here, too.\" British magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"Jordy is an impossibly cute French kid, aged four, whose vocal efforts have earned him a number one hit at home and abroad.\" They viewed the song as \"a serviceable &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; track\".\nCover versions.\nIn 1993, the song was adapted into Portuguese by &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Faria\"&gt;Ana Faria&lt;/a&gt; to be performed by &lt;a href=\"children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"teenpop\"&gt;teenpop&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Onda%20Choc\"&gt;Onda Choc&lt;/a&gt;, known thus as \"Que Vida A De Um Beb\u00e9!\" It's featured on their thirteenth album \"Viva o Ver\u00e3o!\"\nIn 2010, the song was covered by &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9b%C3%A9%20Lilly\"&gt;B\u00e9b\u00e9 Lilly&lt;/a&gt; and released as single in France, where it hit number 15 for two weeks on the singles chart."
