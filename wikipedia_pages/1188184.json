    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"combinatorics\"&gt;combinatorial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, a block design is an &lt;a href=\"incidence%20structure\"&gt;incidence structure&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a set together with a &lt;a href=\"Family%20of%20sets\"&gt;family of subsets&lt;/a&gt; known as \"blocks\", chosen such that frequency of the elements satisfies certain conditions making the collection of blocks exhibit &lt;a href=\"symmetry\"&gt;symmetry&lt;/a&gt; (balance). They have applications in many areas, including &lt;a href=\"experimental%20design\"&gt;experimental design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"finite%20geometry\"&gt;finite geometry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"physical%20chemistry\"&gt;physical chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"software%20testing\"&gt;software testing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cryptography\"&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"algebraic%20geometry\"&gt;algebraic geometry&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithout further specifications the term \"block design\" usually refers to a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), specifically (and also synonymously) a 2-design, which has been the most intensely studied type historically due to its application in the &lt;a href=\"design%20of%20experiments\"&gt;design of experiments&lt;/a&gt;. Its generalization is known as a t-design.\nOverview.\nA design is said to be \"balanced\" (up to \"t\") if all \"t\"-subsets of the original set occur in equally many (i.e., \"\u03bb\") blocks. When \"t\" is unspecified, it can usually be assumed to be 2, which means that each \"pair\" of elements is found in the same number of blocks and the design is \"pairwise balanced\". For \"t\"=1, each element occurs in the same number of blocks (the \"reproduction number\", denoted \"r\") and the design is said to be \"regular\". Any design balanced up to \"t\" is also balanced in all lower values of \"t\" (though with different \"\u03bb\"-values), so for example a pairwise balanced (\"t\"=2) design is also regular (\"t\"=1). When the balancing requirement fails, a design may still be \"partially balanced\" if the \"t\"-subsets can be divided into \"n\" classes, each with its own (different) \"\u03bb\"-value. For \"t\"=2 these are known as PBIBD(\"n\") designs, whose classes form an &lt;a href=\"association%20scheme\"&gt;association scheme&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesigns are usually said (or assumed) to be \"incomplete\", meaning that no block contains all the elements of the set, thus ruling out a trivial design.\nA block design in which all the blocks have the same size (usually denoted \"k\") is called \"uniform\" or \"proper\". The designs discussed in this article are all uniform. Block designs that are not necessarily uniform have also been studied; for \"t\"=2 they are known in the literature under the general name &lt;a href=\"Combinatorial%20design%23pairwise%20balanced%20design\"&gt;pairwise balanced designs&lt;/a&gt; (PBDs).\nBlock designs may or may not have repeated blocks. Designs without repeated blocks are called \"simple\", in which case the \"family\" of blocks is a &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; rather than a &lt;a href=\"multiset\"&gt;multiset&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, the concept of a block design may be extended to \"non-binary\" block designs, in which blocks may contain multiple copies of an element (see &lt;a href=\"blocking%20%28statistics%29\"&gt;blocking (statistics)&lt;/a&gt;). There, a design in which each element occurs the same total number of times is called \"equireplicate,\" which implies a \"regular\" design only when the design is also binary. The incidence matrix of a non-binary design lists the number of times each element is repeated in each block.\nRegular uniform designs (configurations).\nThe simplest type of \"balanced\" design (\"t\"=1) is known as a tactical configuration or 1-design. The corresponding &lt;a href=\"incidence%20structure\"&gt;incidence structure&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; is known simply as a configuration, see &lt;a href=\"Configuration%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;Configuration (geometry)&lt;/a&gt;. Such a design is uniform and regular: each block contains \"k\" elements and each element is contained in \"r\" blocks. The number of set elements \"v\" and the number of blocks \"b\" are related by formula_1, which is the total number of element occurrences.\nEvery &lt;a href=\"binary%20matrix\"&gt;binary matrix&lt;/a&gt; with constant row and column sums is the &lt;a href=\"incidence%20matrix\"&gt;incidence matrix&lt;/a&gt; of a regular uniform block design. Also, each configuration has a corresponding &lt;a href=\"Biregular%20graph\"&gt;biregular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bipartite%20graph\"&gt;bipartite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29\"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; known as its incidence or &lt;a href=\"Levi%20graph\"&gt;Levi graph&lt;/a&gt;.\nPairwise balanced uniform designs (2-designs or BIBDs).\nGiven a finite set \"X\" (of elements called \"points\") and integers \"k\", \"r\", \"\u03bb\" \u2265 1, we define a \"2-design\" (or \"BIBD\", standing for balanced incomplete block design) \"B\" to be a family of \"k\"-element subsets of \"X\", called \"blocks\", such that any \"x\" in \"X\" is contained in \"r\" blocks, and any pair of distinct points \"x\" and \"y\" in \"X\" is contained in \"\u03bb\" blocks. Here, the condition that any \"x\" in \"X\" is contained in \"r\" blocks is redundant, as shown below.\nHere \"v\" (the number of elements of \"X\", called points), \"b\" (the number of blocks), \"k\", \"r\", and \u03bb are the \"parameters\" of the design. (To avoid degenerate examples, it is also assumed that \"v\" &gt; \"k\", so that no block contains all the elements of the set. This is the meaning of \"incomplete\" in the name of these designs.) In a table:\nThe design is called a (\"v\", \"k\", \"\u03bb\")-design or a (\"v\", \"b\", \"r\", \"k\", \"\u03bb\")-design. The parameters are not all independent; \"v\", \"k\", and \u03bb determine \"b\" and \"r\", and not all combinations of \"v\", \"k\", and \"\u03bb\" are possible. The two basic equations connecting these parameters are\nobtained by counting the number of pairs (\"B\", \"p\") where \"B\" is a block and \"p\" is a point in that block, and\nobtained from counting for a fixed \"x\" the triples (\"x\", \"y\", \"B\") where \"x\" and \"y\" are distinct points and \"B\" is a block that contains them both. This equation for every \"x\" also proves that \"r\" is constant (independent of \"x\") even without assuming it explicitly, thus proving that the condition that any \"x\" in \"X\" is contained in \"r\" blocks is redundant and \"r\" can be computed from the other parameters.\nThese conditions are not sufficient as, for example, a (43,7,1)-design does not exist.\nThe \"order\" of a 2-design is defined to be \"n\" = \"r\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"\u03bb\". The complement of a 2-design is obtained by replacing each block with its complement in the point set \"X\". It is also a 2-design and has parameters \"v\"\u2032 = \"v\", \"b\"\u2032 = \"b\", \"r\"\u2032 = \"b\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"r\", \"k\"\u2032 = \"v\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"k\", \"\u03bb\"\u2032 = \"\u03bb\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"b\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02\"r\". A 2-design and its complement have the same order.\nA fundamental theorem, &lt;a href=\"Fisher%27s%20inequality\"&gt;Fisher's inequality&lt;/a&gt;, named after the statistician &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Fisher\"&gt;Ronald Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, is that \"b\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\"v\" in any 2-design.\nExamples.\nThe unique (6,3,2)-design (\"v\" = 6, \"k\" = 3, \"\u03bb\" = 2) has 10 blocks (\"b\" = 10) and each element is repeated 5 times (\"r\" = 5). Using the symbols 0 \u2212 5, the blocks are the following triples:\nand the corresponding &lt;a href=\"incidence%20matrix\"&gt;incidence matrix&lt;/a&gt; (a \"v\"\u00d7\"b\" &lt;a href=\"binary%20matrix\"&gt;binary matrix&lt;/a&gt; with constant row sum \"r\" and constant column sum \"k\") is:\nOne of four nonisomorphic (8,4,3)-designs has 14 blocks with each element repeated 7 times. Using the symbols 0 \u2212 7 the blocks are the following 4-tuples:\nThe unique (7,3,1)-design is symmetric and has 7 blocks with each element repeated 3 times. Using the symbols 0 \u2212 6, the blocks are the following triples:\nThis design is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Fano%20plane\"&gt;Fano plane&lt;/a&gt;, with the elements and blocks of the design &lt;a href=\"Fano%20plane%23Block%20design%20theory\"&gt;corresponding&lt;/a&gt; to the points and lines of the plane. Its corresponding incidence matrix can also be symmetric, if the labels or blocks are sorted the right way:\nSymmetric 2-designs (SBIBDs).\nThe case of equality in Fisher's inequality, that is, a 2-design with an equal number of points and blocks, is called a symmetric design. Symmetric designs have the smallest number of blocks among all the 2-designs with the same number of points.\nIn a symmetric design \"r\" = \"k\" holds as well as \"b\" = \"v\", and, while it is generally not true in arbitrary 2-designs, in a symmetric design every two distinct blocks meet in \"\u03bb\" points. A theorem of &lt;a href=\"H.%20J.%20Ryser\"&gt;Ryser&lt;/a&gt; provides the converse. If \"X\" is a \"v\"-element set, and \"B\" is a \"v\"-element set of \"k\"-element subsets (the \"blocks\"), such that any two distinct blocks have exactly \u03bb points in common, then (\"X, B\") is a symmetric block design.\nThe parameters of a symmetric design satisfy\nThis imposes strong restrictions on \"v\", so the number of points is far from arbitrary. The &lt;a href=\"Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla%20theorem\"&gt;Bruck\u2013Ryser\u2013Chowla theorem&lt;/a&gt; gives necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for the existence of a symmetric design in terms of these parameters.\nThe following are important examples of symmetric 2-designs:\nProjective planes.\n&lt;a href=\"Projective%20plane%23Finite%20projective%20planes\"&gt;Finite projective planes&lt;/a&gt; are symmetric 2-designs with \"\u03bb\" = 1 and order \"n\" &gt; 1. For these designs the symmetric design equation becomes:\nSince \"k\" = \"r\" we can write the \"order of a projective plane\" as \"n\" = \"k\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 and, from the displayed equation above, we obtain \"v\" = (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 = \"n\"2\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 points in a projective plane of order \"n\".\nAs a projective plane is a symmetric design, we have \"b\" = \"v\", meaning that \"b\" = \"n\"2\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 also. The number \"b\" is the number of \"lines\" of the projective plane. There can be no repeated lines since \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01, so a projective plane is a simple 2-design in which the number of lines and the number of points are always the same. For a projective plane, \"k\" is the number of points on each line and it is equal to \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01. Similarly, \"r\" = \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 is the number of lines with which a given point is incident.\nFor \"n\" = 2 we get a projective plane of order 2, also called the &lt;a href=\"Fano%20plane\"&gt;Fano plane&lt;/a&gt;, with \"v\" = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 points and 7 lines. In the Fano plane, each line has \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 = 3 points and each point belongs to \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0=\u00a03 lines.\nProjective planes are known to exist for all orders which are prime numbers or powers of primes. They form the only known infinite family (with respect to having a constant \u03bb value) of symmetric block designs.\nBiplanes.\nA biplane or biplane geometry is a symmetric 2-design with \"\u03bb\" = 2; that is, every set of two points is contained in two blocks (\"lines\"), while any two lines intersect in two points. They are similar to finite projective planes, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), two points determine two lines (respectively, points). A biplane of order \"n\" is one whose blocks have \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02 points; it has \"v\"\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0+\u00a0(\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02)(\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)/2 points (since \"r\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"k\").\nThe 18 known examples are listed below.\nBiplanes of orders 5, 6, 8 and 10 do not exist, as shown by the &lt;a href=\"Bruck-Ryser-Chowla%20theorem\"&gt;Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem&lt;/a&gt;.\nHadamard 2-designs.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Hadamard%20matrix\"&gt;Hadamard matrix&lt;/a&gt; of size \"m\" is an \"m\" \u00d7 \"m\" matrix H whose entries are \u00b11 such that HH\u22a4 \u00a0=\u00a0mIm, where H\u22a4 is the transpose of H and I\"m\" is the \"m\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"m\" identity matrix. An Hadamard matrix can be put into \"standardized form\" (that is, converted to an equivalent Hadamard matrix) where the first row and first column entries are all +1. If the size \"m\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a02 then \"m\" must be a multiple of 4.\nGiven an Hadamard matrix of size 4\"a\" in standardized form, remove the first row and first column and convert every \u22121 to a 0. The resulting 0\u20131 matrix M is the &lt;a href=\"incidence%20matrix\"&gt;incidence matrix&lt;/a&gt; of a symmetric 2-(4\"a\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, 2\"a\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, \"a\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) design called an Hadamard 2-design. \nIt contains formula_8 blocks/points; each contains/is contained in formula_9 points/blocks. Each pair of points is contained in exactly formula_10 blocks.\nThis construction is reversible, and the incidence matrix of a symmetric 2-design with these parameters can be used to form an Hadamard matrix of size 4\"a\".\nResolvable 2-designs.\nA resolvable 2-design is a BIBD whose blocks can be partitioned into sets (called \"parallel classes\"), each of which forms a partition of the point set of the BIBD. The set of parallel classes is called a \"resolution\" of the design.\nIf a 2-(\"v\",\"k\",\u03bb) resolvable design has \"c\" parallel classes, then \"b\" \u00a0\u2265\u00a0\"v\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"c\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.\nConsequently, a symmetric design can not have a non-trivial (more than one parallel class) resolution.\nArchetypical resolvable 2-designs are the finite &lt;a href=\"projective%20plane%23Affine%20planes\"&gt;affine planes&lt;/a&gt;. A solution of the famous &lt;a href=\"15%20schoolgirl%20problem\"&gt;15 schoolgirl problem&lt;/a&gt; is a resolution of a 2-(15,3,1) design.\nGeneral balanced designs (\"t\"-designs).\nGiven any positive integer \"t\", a \"t\"-design \"B\" is a class of \"k\"-element subsets of \"X\", called \"blocks\", such that every point \"x\" in \"X\" appears in exactly \"r\" blocks, and every \"t\"-element subset \"T\" appears in exactly \u03bb blocks. The numbers \"v\" (the number of elements of \"X\"), \"b\" (the number of blocks), \"k\", \"r\", \u03bb, and \"t\" are the \"parameters\" of the design. The design may be called a \"t\"-(\"v\",\"k\",\u03bb)-design. Again, these four numbers determine \"b\" and \"r\" and the four numbers themselves cannot be chosen arbitrarily. The equations are\nwhere \"\u03bbi\" is the number of blocks that contain any \"i\"-element set of points and \"\u03bbt\" = \u03bb.\nNote that formula_12 and formula_13.\nTheorem: Any \"t\"-(\"v\",\"k\",\u03bb)-design is also an \"s\"-(\"v\",\"k\",\u03bbs)-design for any \"s\" with 1\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"s\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"t\". (Note that the \"lambda value\" changes as above and depends on \"s\".)\nA consequence of this theorem is that every \"t\"-design with \"t\" \u2265 2 is also a 2-design.\nA \"t\"-(\"v\",\"k\",1)-design is called a &lt;a href=\"Steiner%20system\"&gt;Steiner system&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"block design\" by itself usually means a 2-design.\nDerived and extendable t-designs.\nLet D = (\"X\", \"B\") be a t-(\"v\",\"k\",\"\u03bb\") design and \"p\" a point of \"X\". The \"derived design\" \"D\"\"p\" has point set \"X\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0{\"p\"} and as block set all the blocks of D which contain p with p removed. It is a (\"t\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)-(\"v\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, \"k\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, \"\u03bb\") design. Note that derived designs with respect to different points may not be isomorphic. A design E is called an \"extension\" of D if E has a point p such that Ep is isomorphic to D; we call D \"extendable\" if it has an extension.\nTheorem: If a \"t\"-(\"v\",\"k\",\"\u03bb\") design has an extension, then \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01 divides \"b\"(\"v\"\u00a0+\u00a01).\nThe only extendable &lt;a href=\"projective%20plane\"&gt;projective plane&lt;/a&gt;s (symmetric 2-(\"n\"2\u00a0+\u00a0\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01, \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01, 1) designs) are those of orders 2 and\u00a04.\nEvery Hadamard 2-design is extendable (to an Hadamard 3-design).\nTheorem:.\nIf D, a symmetric 2-(\"v\",\"k\",\u03bb) design, is extendable, then one of the following holds:\nNote that the projective plane of order two is an Hadamard 2-design; the projective plane of order four has parameters which fall in case 2; the only other known symmetric 2-designs with parameters in case 2 are the order 9 biplanes, but none of them are extendable; and there is no known symmetric 2-design with the parameters of case 3.\nInversive planes.\nA design with the parameters of the extension of an &lt;a href=\"affine%20plane%20%28incidence%20geometry%29%23Finite%20affine%20plane\"&gt;affine plane&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., a 3-(\"n\"2\u00a0+\u00a01, \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01, 1) design, is called a finite inversive plane, or &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6bius%20plane\"&gt;M\u00f6bius plane&lt;/a&gt;, of order\u00a0\"n\".\nIt is possible to give a geometric description of some inversive planes, indeed, of all known inversive planes. An \"&lt;a href=\"Ovoid%20%28projective%20geometry%29\"&gt;ovoid&lt;/a&gt;\" in PG(3,\"q\") is a set of \"q\"2\u00a0+\u00a01 points, no three collinear. It can be shown that every plane (which is a hyperplane since the geometric dimension is 3) of PG(3,\"q\") meets an ovoid \"O\" in either 1 or \"q\"\u00a0+\u00a01 points. The plane sections of size \"q\"\u00a0+\u00a01 of \"O\" are the blocks of an inversive plane of order\u00a0\"q\". Any inversive plane arising this way is called \"egglike\". All known inversive planes are egglike.\nAn example of an ovoid is the &lt;a href=\"Quadric%20%28projective%20geometry%29\"&gt;elliptic quadric&lt;/a&gt;, the set of zeros of the quadratic form\nwhere f is an irreducible &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20form\"&gt;quadratic form&lt;/a&gt; in two variables over GF(\"q\"). [\"f\"(\"x\",\"y\") = \"x\"2 + \"xy\" + \"y\"2 for example].\nIf \"q\" is an odd power of 2, another type of ovoid is known \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Ovoid%20%28projective%20geometry%29\"&gt;Suzuki\u2013Tits ovoid&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheorem. Let \"q\" be a positive integer, at least 2. (a) If \"q\" is odd, then any ovoid is projectively equivalent to the elliptic quadric in a projective geometry PG(3,\"q\"); so \"q\" is a prime power and there is a unique egglike inversive plane of order \"q\". (But it is unknown if non-egglike ones exist.) (b) if \"q\" is even, then \"q\" is a power of 2 and any inversive plane of order \"q\" is egglike (but there may be some unknown ovoids).\nPartially balanced designs (PBIBDs).\nAn \"n\"-class &lt;a href=\"association%20scheme\"&gt;association scheme&lt;/a&gt; consists of a &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; \"X\" of size \"v\" together with a &lt;a href=\"partition%20of%20a%20set\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt; \"S\" of \"X\" \u00d7 \"X\" into \"n\" + 1 &lt;a href=\"binary%20relation\"&gt;binary relation&lt;/a&gt;s, R0, R1, ..., Rn. A pair of elements in relation Ri are said to be \"i\"th\u2013\"associates\". Each element of \"X\" has \"n\"i\u00a0 \"i\"th associates. Furthermore:\nAn association scheme is \"commutative\" if formula_21 for all \"i\", \"j\" and \"k\". Most authors assume this property.\nA partially balanced incomplete block design with \"n\" associate classes (PBIBD(\"n\")) is a block design based on a \"v\"-set X with \"b\" blocks each of size \"k\" and with each element appearing in \"r\" blocks, such that there is an association scheme with \"n\" classes defined on \"X\" where, if elements \"x\" and \"y\" are \"i\"th associates, 1 \u2264 \"i\" \u2264 \"n\", then they are together in precisely \u03bbi blocks.\nA PBIBD(\"n\") determines an association scheme but the converse is false.\nExample.\nLet \"A\"(3) be the following association scheme with three associate classes on the set \"X\" = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The (\"i\",\"j\") entry is \"s\" if elements \"i\" and \"j\" are in relation Rs.\nThe blocks of a PBIBD(3) based on \"A\"(3) are:\nThe parameters of this PBIBD(3) are: \"v\" \u00a0=\u00a0 6, \"b\" \u00a0=\u00a0 8, \"k\" \u00a0=\u00a0 3, \"r\" \u00a0=\u00a0 4 and \u03bb1\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bb2\u00a0=\u00a02 and \u03bb3\u00a0=\u00a01. Also, for the association scheme we have \"n\"0 \u00a0=\u00a0 \"n\"2 \u00a0=\u00a0 1 and \"n\"1 \u00a0=\u00a0 \"n\"3 \u00a0=\u00a0 2. The incidence matrix M is\nformula_22\nand the concurrence matrix MMT is\nformula_23\nfrom which we can recover the \"\u03bb\" and \"r\" values.\nProperties.\nThe parameters of a PBIBD(\"m\") satisfy:\nA PBIBD(1) is a BIBD and a PBIBD(2) in which \u03bb1 \u00a0=\u00a0 \u03bb2 is a BIBD.\nTwo associate class PBIBDs.\nPBIBD(2)s have been studied the most since they are the simplest and most useful of the PBIBDs. They fall into six types based on a classification of the \"then known\" PBIBD(2)s by :\nApplications.\nThe mathematical subject of block designs originated in the statistical framework of &lt;a href=\"design%20of%20experiments\"&gt;design of experiments&lt;/a&gt;. These designs were especially useful in applications of the technique of &lt;a href=\"Analysis%20of%20variance\"&gt;analysis of variance (ANOVA)&lt;/a&gt;. This remains a significant area for the use of block designs.\nWhile the origins of the subject are grounded in biological applications (as is some of the existing terminology), the designs are used in many applications where systematic comparisons are being made, such as in &lt;a href=\"software%20testing\"&gt;software testing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"incidence%20matrix\"&gt;incidence matrix&lt;/a&gt; of block designs provide a natural source of interesting &lt;a href=\"block%20code\"&gt;block code&lt;/a&gt;s that are used as &lt;a href=\"error%20correcting%20code\"&gt;error correcting code&lt;/a&gt;s. The rows of their incidence matrices are also used as the symbols in a form of &lt;a href=\"pulse-position%20modulation\"&gt;pulse-position modulation&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatistical application.\nSuppose that skin cancer researchers want to test three different sunscreens. They coat two different sunscreens on the upper sides of the hands of a test person. After a UV radiation they record the skin irritation in terms of sunburn. The number of treatments is 3 (sunscreens) and the block size is 2 (hands per person).\nA corresponding BIBD can be generated by the &lt;a href=\"R%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-function \"design.bib\" of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//cran.r-project.org/package%3Dagricolae\"&gt;R-package agricolae&lt;/a&gt; and is specified in the following table:\nThe investigator chooses the parameters , and for the block design which are then inserted into the R-function. Subsequently, the remaining parameters and are determined automatically.\nUsing the basic relations we calculate that we need blocks, that is, 3 test people in order to obtain a balanced incomplete block design. Labeling the blocks and , to avoid confusion, we have the block design,\nA corresponding &lt;a href=\"incidence%20matrix\"&gt;incidence matrix&lt;/a&gt; is specified in the following table:\nEach treatment occurs in 2 blocks, so .\nJust one block () contains the treatments 1 and 2 simultaneously and the same applies to the pairs of treatments (1,3) and (2,3). Therefore, .\nIt is impossible to use a complete design (all treatments in each block) in this example because there are 3 sunscreens to test, but only 2 hands on each person."
