    "text": "Peter Joseph Verhaegen, &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;S.J.&lt;/a&gt; (born Pierre Joseph Verh\u00e6egen; June 21, 1800July 21, 1868) was a Belgian &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; priest, &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"missionary\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwestern United States&lt;/a&gt; who became the first president of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University\"&gt;Saint Louis University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spalding%20Hall\"&gt;St. Joseph's College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Bardstown, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, Verhaegen traveled to the United States at the age of 21, where he studied at the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"novitiate\"&gt;novitiate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1823, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20presidents%20of%20Saint%20Louis%20University\"&gt;president of Saint Louis University&lt;/a&gt; in 1829, for which the Jesuits had newly assumed responsibility. During his leadership, the college was &lt;a href=\"University%20charter\"&gt;chartered&lt;/a&gt; by the state and was elevated to the status of university. In 1836, Verhaegen became the superior of the Jesuits' Missouri Mission, which was elevated to a vice province in 1839.\nIn 1845, Verhaegen became the &lt;a href=\"provincial%20superior\"&gt;provincial superior&lt;/a&gt; of the Jesuits' Maryland Province, where he remained until 1848 when he became the first president of &lt;a href=\"Spalding%20Hall\"&gt;St. Joseph's College&lt;/a&gt; in Kentucky. In his later years, he taught theology and preached at Saint Louis University.\nEarly life.\nPeter Joseph Verhaegen was born on June 21, 1800, in &lt;a href=\"Haacht\"&gt;Haacht&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"South%20Brabant\"&gt;South Brabant&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Kingdom of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; (modern-day Belgium). His brother was &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Th%C3%A9odore%20Verhaegen\"&gt;Pierre-Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"freemason\"&gt;freemason&lt;/a&gt;, who became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the Belgian &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Chamber of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. He studied &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mechelen\"&gt;Mechelen&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he and six other seminarians met &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Nerinckx\"&gt;Charles Nerinckx&lt;/a&gt;, who was raising funds for his &lt;a href=\"Christian%20mission\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Bardstown\"&gt;Diocese of Bardstown&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. They decided to join him, in traveling to the United States, where they would enter the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and become &lt;a href=\"Missionary\"&gt;missionaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 15, 1821, they departed from &lt;a href=\"Texel\"&gt;Texel&lt;/a&gt;, traveling in secret because they were required to serve in the military. They arrived in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; on September 23, and then traveled on to &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately to &lt;a href=\"White%20Marsh%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;White Marsh, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. They entered the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"novitiate\"&gt;novitiate&lt;/a&gt; there on October 21, 1821.\nUnder the direction of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Felix%20Van%20Quickenborne\"&gt;Charles Felix Van Quickenborne&lt;/a&gt;, Verhaegen was sent along with a group of other novices to establish a mission in &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. They left White Marsh on April 14, 1823, and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; on May 30. They then traveled up the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20River\"&gt;Missouri River&lt;/a&gt; and arrived at the site of the new novitiate, located from St. Louis, several days later.\nSince Verhaegen had nearly completed his studies at the Mechelen seminary, he was responsible for instructing the younger novices in theology and &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, he continued to complete his own studies for the priesthood. He was ordained a &lt;a href=\"Priesthood%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; by Bishop &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Rosati\"&gt;Joseph Rosati&lt;/a&gt; of St. Louis in 1826, at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary%27s%20of%20the%20Barrens%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Perryville%2C%20Missouri%29\"&gt;St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary&lt;/a&gt;. Verhaegen began his ministry in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Charles%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Charles&lt;/a&gt;, while also periodically visiting Catholics in St. Louis and elsewhere. At the time, there was only a simple, wooden church in St. Charles, and Verhaegen was involved in the construction of a new, larger, stone church, which opened in 1827.\nSaint Louis University.\nIn 1829, the Jesuits assumed control of Saint Louis College. At the same time, Verhaegen was named to succeed Van Quickenborne as the fourth president of the college. During his tenure, the college was formally &lt;a href=\"University%20charter\"&gt;chartered&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Missouri General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University\"&gt;Saint Louis University&lt;/a&gt;, thereby becoming the first university west of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Verhaegen became the first president of the new university. He oversaw construction of the university's first permanent building, and also designed its curriculum.\nMissouri vice provincial.\nIn 1836, Verhaegen became the &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20superior\"&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt; of the Jesuits' Missouri mission, thereby resigning his post as president of Saint Louis University, where he was succeeded by John A. Elet. During his leadership, a mission to the &lt;a href=\"Kickapoo%20people\"&gt;Kickapoo&lt;/a&gt; tribe was established near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Leavenworth\"&gt;Fort Leavenworth, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, in 1836, and a mission to the &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Pottawatomie&lt;/a&gt; tribe was established in &lt;a href=\"Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa\"&gt;Council Bluffs, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, in 1838. The province also took over an existing diocesan mission to the Pottawatomie in &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Creek%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Sugar Creek, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, the following year. Verhaegen also sent a group of Jesuits to relieve a contingent of French Jesuits as professors at the newly established &lt;a href=\"St.%20Charles%20College%20%28Louisiana%29\"&gt;St. Charles College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Coteau%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Grand Coteau, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, for which the Missouri Vice Province assumed responsibility.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Superior%20General%20of%20the%20Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit Superior General&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; elevated the Missouri mission to a vice province on December 24, 1839. When news of this decree reached St. Louis on March 9, 1840, Verhaegen was elevated to vice provincial superior. That year, he sent &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Jean%20De%20Smet\"&gt;Pierre-Jean De Smet&lt;/a&gt; as the first Jesuit missionary to the &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountains\"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Country\"&gt;Oregon Country&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1840, Verhaegen also became the &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20administration\"&gt;apostolic administrator&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;Diocese of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs vice provincial, Verhaegen also saw to the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;Saint Louis University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. His tenure in the office came to an end in 1842, and he was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"James%20Oliver%20Van%20de%20Velde\"&gt;James Oliver Van de Velde&lt;/a&gt;. He spent the next two years as superior of the Jesuit residence in St. Charles, Missouri, and &lt;a href=\"pastor\"&gt;pastor&lt;/a&gt; of St. Charles Borromeo Church.\nLater years.\nVerhaegen was made the provincial superior of the Jesuit Maryland province on January 4, 1845, replacing &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Ryder\"&gt;James A. Ryder&lt;/a&gt;. He would hold the position until January 26, 1848, when he returned to Missouri and was succeeded by Ignatius Brocard. In 1848, he became the first president of &lt;a href=\"Spalding%20Hall\"&gt;St. Joseph's College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Bardstown, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, which was newly under the control of the Missouri Vice Province. He proved to be popular among the students, but his health began to deteriorate, and he resigned the presidency three years later. He once again became the superior of the Jesuit residence in St. Charles.\nIn 1857, Verhaegen returned to Saint Louis University as the chair of theology and professor of &lt;a href=\"Moral%20theology\"&gt;moral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dogmatic%20theology\"&gt;dogmatic theology&lt;/a&gt; at the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"Jesuit%20formation\"&gt;scholasticate&lt;/a&gt;. He also delivered lectures at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Francis%20Xavier%20College%20Church\"&gt;St. Francis Xavier College Church&lt;/a&gt;. When the scholasticate was removed the following year from the university to &lt;a href=\"College%20Hill%2C%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;College Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Verhaegen retired to the residence in St. Charles, where he died on July 21, 1868. He was buried in the Jesuit cemetery in &lt;a href=\"Florissant%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Florissant, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;."
