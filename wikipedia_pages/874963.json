    "text": "This article gives an overview of liberalism in &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;. It is limited to &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign \u21d2 denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.\nHistory.\nA form of radical liberalism was dominant shortly after independence, but became oppressed. After the restoration of democracy in the 1990s, liberalism was and is only a weak political factor. Two parties could be considered to embrace liberal values: the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Alliance%20Party%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;Democratic Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Partia Aleanca Demokratike\", member &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;LI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party\"&gt;ELDR&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20for%20Human%20Rights%20Party\"&gt;Unity for Human Rights Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Partia Bashkimi p\u00ebr t\u00eb Drejtat e Njeriut\"), which is the party of the ethnic minorities.\nDemocratic Alliance Party.\n1992: A liberal faction of the conservative &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Democratic Party of Albania&lt;/a&gt; (\"Partia Demokratike e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb\") seceded to form the present-day &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Alliance%20Party%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;Democratic Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Partia Aleanca Demokratike\")"
