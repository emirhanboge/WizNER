    "text": "Adrastea , also known as , is the second by distance, and the smallest of the four &lt;a href=\"Inner%20satellites%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;inner moons of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered in photographs taken by \"&lt;a href=\"Voyager%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2\"&gt;Voyager\u00a02&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1979, making it the first &lt;a href=\"natural%20satellite\"&gt;natural satellite&lt;/a&gt; to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary &lt;a href=\"spacecraft\"&gt;spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, rather than through a telescope. It was officially named after the mythological &lt;a href=\"Adrasteia\"&gt;Adrasteia&lt;/a&gt;, foster mother of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20god\"&gt;Greek god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20god\"&gt;Roman god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jupiter%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdrastea is one of the few moons in the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt; known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Rings%20of%20Jupiter%23Main%20ring\"&gt;Jupiter's Main Ring&lt;/a&gt; and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the &lt;a href=\"Rings%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;Rings of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;\"Galileo\" spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is &lt;a href=\"tidally%20locked\"&gt;tidally locked&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jupiter\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscovery and observations.\nAdrastea was discovered by &lt;a href=\"David%20Jewitt\"&gt;David C. Jewitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G.%20Edward%20Danielson\"&gt;G. Edward Danielson&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Voyager%202\"&gt;Voyager\u00a02&lt;/a&gt;\" probe photographs taken on July 8, 1979, and received the designation . Although it appeared only as a dot, it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft. Soon after its discovery, two other of the inner &lt;a href=\"moons%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;moons of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Thebe%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Thebe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metis%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Metis&lt;/a&gt;) were observed in the images taken a few months earlier by \"&lt;a href=\"Voyager%201\"&gt;Voyager\u00a01&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20spacecraft\"&gt;\"Galileo\" spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; was able to determine the moon's shape in 1998, but the images remain poor. In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph &lt;a href=\"Adrastea%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Adrastea&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and his lover &lt;a href=\"Ananke%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Ananke&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the \"&lt;a href=\"Juno%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;\" orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called &lt;a href=\"JunoCam\"&gt;JunoCam&lt;/a&gt;, it is almost entirely focused on observations of Jupiter itself. However, if all goes well, it should be able to capture some limited images of the moons &lt;a href=\"Metis%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Metis&lt;/a&gt; and Adrastea.\nPhysical characteristics.\nAdrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20\u00d716\u00d714\u00a0km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of &lt;a href=\"Amalthea%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Amalthea&lt;/a&gt;, around 0.86\u00a0g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2\u00a0kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"porosity\"&gt;porosity&lt;/a&gt; of 10\u201315%, and Adrastea may be similar.\nNo surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.\nOrbit.\nAdrastea is the smallest and second-closest member of the &lt;a href=\"inner%20satellites%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;inner Jovian satellite family&lt;/a&gt;. It orbits &lt;a href=\"Jupiter\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; at a radius of about 129,000\u00a0km (1.806\u00a0Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's &lt;a href=\"Rings%20of%20Jupiter%23Main%20ring\"&gt;Main Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Adrastea is one of only three moons in the &lt;a href=\"Solar%20System\"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt; known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day\u2014the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon &lt;a href=\"Metis%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Metis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;' moon &lt;a href=\"Phobos%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Phobos&lt;/a&gt;. The orbit has very small &lt;a href=\"orbital%20eccentricity\"&gt;eccentricity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inclination\"&gt;inclination&lt;/a&gt;\u2014around 0.0015 and 0.03\u00b0, respectively. Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"tidal%20locking\"&gt;tidal locking&lt;/a&gt;, Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.\nThe orbit of Adrastea lies inside &lt;a href=\"Jupiter\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"synchronous%20orbit\"&gt;synchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt; radius (as does &lt;a href=\"Metis%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Metis&lt;/a&gt;'s), and as a result, &lt;a href=\"tidal%20deceleration\"&gt;tidal force&lt;/a&gt;s are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid &lt;a href=\"Roche%20limit\"&gt;Roche limit&lt;/a&gt;. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.\nAdrastea is the second-fastest-moving of Jupiter's moons, with an orbital speed of 31.378\u00a0km/s.\nRelationship with Jupiter's rings.\nAdrastea is the largest contributor to material in &lt;a href=\"rings%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;Jupiter's rings&lt;/a&gt;. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of &lt;a href=\"Inner%20satellites%20of%20Jupiter\"&gt;Jupiter's four small inner satellites&lt;/a&gt; by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is due to the satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their &lt;a href=\"Roche%20sphere\"&gt;Roche sphere&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the &lt;a href=\"Rings%20of%20Jupiter%23Main%20ring\"&gt;Main Ring&lt;/a&gt;) being located at and within Adrastea's orbit. More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring. The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in &lt;a href=\"light%20scattering\"&gt;forward-scattered light&lt;/a&gt; Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring, but in &lt;a href=\"Backscatter\"&gt;back-scattered light&lt;/a&gt; (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea's orbit.\nReferences.\nCited sources"
