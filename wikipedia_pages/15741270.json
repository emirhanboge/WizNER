    "text": "Emory S. Foster (November 5, 1839 \u2013 December 23, 1902) was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in the 7th &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20State%20Militia%20%28Union%29\"&gt;Missouri State Militia&lt;/a&gt; Cavalry during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. After the Civil War, he was a &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; newspaper editor. While serving as an editor, Foster fought a &lt;a href=\"duel\"&gt;duel&lt;/a&gt; with rival editor and former &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20N.%20Edwards\"&gt;John N. Edwards&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil War.\nFoster was born in &lt;a href=\"Greene%20County%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Greene County, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was a staunch Unionist whose brother Marshall was murdered by secessionists in early 1861 on his way to vote. During the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, on Emory formed a &lt;a href=\"Home%20Guard%20%28Union%29\"&gt;Unionist Home Guard&lt;/a&gt; company called \"Foster's Mounted Rangers\" in which he served as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, enlisting on August 28, 1861. He later enlisted in the Federally funded &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20State%20Militia%20%28Union%29\"&gt;Missouri State Militia&lt;/a&gt;, being elected major of the 7th MSM Cavalry. He and his men engaged in skirmishes around his new home in &lt;a href=\"Warrensburg%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Warrensburg, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and Foster gained a reputation as an aggressive commander.\nOn August 15, 1862 after a two-day march from &lt;a href=\"Warrensburg%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Warrensburg, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lexington%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Lexington, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, he was ordered to take 800 men on a 20-mile march to &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Jack%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Lone Jack, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; to engage Confederate troops that were attempting to capture &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20County%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Jackson County, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; in what would become the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lone%20Jack\"&gt;Battle of Lone Jack&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival, Foster's force encountered an 800-1,600 man sleeping Confederate recruiting force under &lt;a href=\"Colonel\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20T.%20Coffee\"&gt;John T. Coffee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Lieutenant Colonel&lt;/a&gt; John Charles Tracy and routed them. However, the firing of Foster's artillery alerted other Confederate recruiting commands in the area of his presence and intent. Confederates under Colonels &lt;a href=\"Vard%20Cockrell\"&gt;Vard Cockrell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Upton%20Hays\"&gt;Upton Hays&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"DeWitt%20C.%20Hunter\"&gt;DeWitt C. Hunter&lt;/a&gt; were joined by Lt. Col. Tracy and a fierce five-hour battle ensued the next morning. The Federals withdrew after Foster was wounded and Col. Coffee's command joined Cockrell.\nFoster and his brother were severely wounded, unable to withdraw, and were taken prisoner in a nearby cabin. Foster was about to be executed by Confederate Colonel Dr. Josiah Hatcher Caldwell, with whom he had been bitter enemies since before the war, when an 18-year-old &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Younger\"&gt;Cole Younger&lt;/a&gt; physically threw Colonel Caldwell out of the cabin, sparing Foster and his brother's life. They gave $1,000 and their handguns to Younger who then delivered them to the Foster sons' mother in Warrensburg (all despite Younger's being a member of the Confederates).\nIn 1876, Younger as a member of the &lt;a href=\"James-Younger%20Gang\"&gt;James-Younger Gang&lt;/a&gt; was captured in the botched &lt;a href=\"Northfield%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Northfield, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; bank robbery. Foster was to forcefully argue for a parole for Younger in the 1890s. Also arguing for the parole was future &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;Secretary of War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Benton%20Elkins\"&gt;Stephen Benton Elkins&lt;/a&gt; whose only taste of combat had been at Lone Jack, an experience which he said filled him with disgust of war.\nDuel with John Newman Edwards.\nAfter the war he became an editor at the St. Louis Journal.\nOn September 4, 1875 he fought a duel north of &lt;a href=\"Rockford%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Rockford, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; with Edwards, who was then an editor of the St. Louis Times (after leaving the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Times\"&gt;Kansas City Times&lt;/a&gt; in 1873).\nThe dispute had centered on an August 25 article by Edwards talking about the mistreatment of &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Davis\"&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Winnebago%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Winnebago County, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Fair. The Journal replied the same day \"the writer of the Times article had lied, and knew he lied, when he wrote it.\"\nEdwards demanded a retraction and Foster refused saying the editorial was not directed at Edwards personally. On August 30 Edwards challenged Foster to a duel:\nTheir seconds made the arrangements and at 5 pm the two met in a field and both missed as Foster smoked a cigar. Foster commented, \"A little high.\"\nEdwards demanded a second fire, \"I will go on if it takes a thousand fires.\"\nFoster refused a second fire. He had been challenged and shots had been fired and so his honor had been maintained.\nBoth shook hands and made a &lt;a href=\"bourbon%20whiskey\"&gt;bourbon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Toast%20%28honor%29\"&gt;toast&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoster died in &lt;a href=\"Oakland%2C%20California\"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;."
