    "text": "United Nations Security Council resolution 660, adopted on 2 August 1990, after noting its alarm of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Kuwait\"&gt;invasion of Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the council condemned the invasion and demanded Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally to positions as they were on 1 August 1990.\n&lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt; called upon Iraq and &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; to enter into immediate negotiations to resolve their differences, thanking the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20League\"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; for its efforts. Talks between both sides broke down the day before in &lt;a href=\"Jeddah\"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. The council also decided to meet again as necessary to ensure compliance with the current resolution.\nThe resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none, while &lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt; did not participate in voting. It was the first of twelve resolutions on the conflict passed in 1990."
