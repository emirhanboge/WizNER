    "text": "Joseph Alfred Pierre Hormisdas \"Pit\" L\u00e9pine (July 30, 1901 \u2013 August 2, 1955) was a &lt;a href=\"Canadians\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; and coach. He was born in &lt;a href=\"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.\nLepine played in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; from 1925 to 1939, spending his entire career with the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Canadiens\"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt;, winning two &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Cup\"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, in &lt;a href=\"1929%E2%80%9330%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1930%E2%80%9331%20NHL%20season\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt;. Lepine, a center, played over 500 games with Montreal and was an excellent goal scorer who could also check and battle for the puck in the corners. He had played senior hockey in Montreal with the Royals, Hochelega and Nationale squads.\nAfter 13 years in the NHL, Lepine finally played a year in the minors with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Haven%20Eagles\"&gt;New Haven Eagles&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;AHL&lt;/a&gt; in 1938\u201339.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Siebert\"&gt;Babe Siebert&lt;/a&gt; drowned in 1939 after being named the coach of the Canadiens, Lepine was named coach for the 1939\u201340 season. The erosion of talent from older players and failure to bring in adequate youngsters doomed the team to a last place finish that season and he was fired and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Irvin\"&gt;Dick Irvin&lt;/a&gt;, who would rebuild the team.\nPit suffered a paralytic stroke in 1951, and had two more strokes in 1954. He died August 2, 1955, in a convalescent home in Ste-Rose, Quebec, from effects of these strokes, only three days after he turned 54. Alfred is the brother of &lt;a href=\"Hector%20L%C3%A9pine\"&gt;Hector L\u00e9pine&lt;/a&gt;."
