    "title": "Culture of Afghanistan",
    "text": "The culture of &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; has persisted for over three &lt;a href=\"millennia\"&gt;millennia&lt;/a&gt;, tracing record to at least the time of the &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Achaemenid Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 500 BCE, and encompasses the cultural diversity of the nation. Its location at the crossroads of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Asia\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; Asia historically made it a hub of diversity, dubbed by one historian as the \"roundabout of the ancient world\".\nAfghanistan is a mostly a tribal society with different regions of the country having its own &lt;a href=\"subculture\"&gt;subculture&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, nearly all &lt;a href=\"Afghans\"&gt;Afghans&lt;/a&gt; follow &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Islamic traditions&lt;/a&gt;, celebrate the same holidays, &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20dress\"&gt;dress the same&lt;/a&gt;, consume the same &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20cuisine\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, listen to the same &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=\"multi-lingual\"&gt;multi-lingual&lt;/a&gt; to a certain extent. Its culture is strongly tied with elements of &lt;a href=\"Turko-Persian%20culture\"&gt;Turko-Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indo-Persian%20culture\"&gt;Indo-Persian culture&lt;/a&gt;s which can be seen in the likes of language, cuisine or classical music.\nAfghan culture is increasingly becoming a dynamic realm of academic study in scholarly terms. In more recent history, Afghan culture has been threatened and fragmented due to the &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20conflict%20%281978-present%29\"&gt;prolonged conflict&lt;/a&gt; in the country.\nMusic.\nTraditionally, only men have been involved in theater acting. Recently, in theater arts, women have begun to take center stage.\nSince the 1980s, the nation has witnessed several wars so music has been suppressed and recording for outsiders minimal. During the 1990s, the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan%20%281996%E2%80%932001%29\"&gt;Taliban government&lt;/a&gt; banned instrumental music and much public music-making. Many musicians and singers continued to play their trade in the cities of other countries. Pakistani cities such as &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Islamabad\"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; are important centers for the distribution of Afghan music. Kabul has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the cities of &lt;a href=\"Herat\"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mazar-i-Sharif\"&gt;Mazar-i-Sharif&lt;/a&gt; with its \"&lt;a href=\"Qataghan%20Province\"&gt;Qataghani&lt;/a&gt;\" style. &lt;a href=\"Lyrics\"&gt;Lyrics&lt;/a&gt; across the country are typically in both &lt;a href=\"Dari-Persian\"&gt;Dari-Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pashto\"&gt;Pashto&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Uzbeki\"&gt;Uzbeki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;, and western style songs and music are also very popular in Afghanistan.\nAfghans enjoy music by playing many types of instruments. They also enjoy performing the &lt;a href=\"Attan\"&gt;Attan&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered the national dance of Afghanistan. What is typically heard in the country are folk songs or &lt;a href=\"ballads\"&gt;ballads&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the songs are known by almost everyone and have been around for many years. The main traditional Afghan music instruments include:\nLanguage and literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Dari%20language\"&gt;Dari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pashto%20language\"&gt;Pashto&lt;/a&gt; are both the official &lt;a href=\"languages%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;languages of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, although Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; for the majority. People in the northern and central areas of the country usually speak Persian/Dari, while those living in the south and east speak Pashto. Afghans living in the western regions of Afghanistan speak both Dari and Pashto. Most citizens are fluent in both languages, especially those living in major cities where the population is multi-ethnic. Several other languages are spoken in their own regions, which includes &lt;a href=\"Uzbek%20language\"&gt;Uzbek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkmen%20language\"&gt;Turkmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balochi%20language\"&gt;Balochi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; is gradually becoming popular among the young generation. There are smaller number of Afghans who can understand Russian, mainly among the northern Tajik, Uzbek and Turkmen groups.\nPoetry.\n&lt;a href=\"Poetry%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Poetry in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; has long been a cultural tradition and passion. It is mainly in Persian/Dari and Pashto languages, although in modern times it is also becoming more recognized in Afghanistan's other languages. Classic &lt;a href=\"Persian%20literature\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pashto%20literature%20and%20poetry\"&gt;Pashto poetry&lt;/a&gt; plays an important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include &lt;a href=\"Khushal%20Khan%20Khattak\"&gt;Khushal Khan Khattak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rahman%20Baba\"&gt;Rahman Baba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massoud%20Nawabi\"&gt;Massoud Nawabi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazo%20Tokhi\"&gt;Nazo Tokhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Ahmad Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ghulam%20Muhammad%20Tarzi\"&gt;Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the famous &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Persian%20poets%20and%20authors\"&gt;Persian poets and authors&lt;/a&gt; from the 10th to 15th centuries are &lt;a href=\"Rumi\"&gt;Rumi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rabi%27a%20Balkhi\"&gt;Rabi'a Balkhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khwaja%20Abdullah%20Ansari\"&gt;Khwaja Abdullah Ansari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jami\"&gt;Jami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alisher%20Navoi\"&gt;Alisher Navoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanai\"&gt;Sanai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Mansur%20Daqiqi\"&gt;Abu Mansur Daqiqi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farrukhi%20Sistani\"&gt;Farrukhi Sistani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unsuri\"&gt;Unsuri&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anvari\"&gt;Anvari&lt;/a&gt;. Contemporary Persian language poets and writers include &lt;a href=\"Khalilullah%20Khalili\"&gt;Khalilullah Khalili&lt;/a&gt; and Sufi Ashqari.\nProverbs.\nAfghans prize wit and cleverness in speech. \"Zarbul Masalha\" (pronounced zar-bull mah-sal-HAA) means \"proverbs\" in &lt;a href=\"Dari%20%28Persian%20dialect%29\"&gt;Dari&lt;/a&gt;, and these \"zarbul masalha\" deeply reflect Afghan culture. U.S. Navy Captain &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Zellem\"&gt;Edward Zellem&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English.\nPet keeping.\n&lt;a href=\"Bird\"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt;s are the most popular animals that are kept as &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s in Afghanistan. In Kabul there is a dedicated daily market selling a wide variety of birds from around the world.\nArchitecture.\nThe important architectural sites are found in &lt;a href=\"Herat\"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazar-I-Sharif\"&gt;Mazar-I-Sharif&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghazni\"&gt;Ghazni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kandahar\"&gt;Qandahar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaghcharan\"&gt;Firuzkoh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ghor%20Province\"&gt;Ghor Province&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region has made major contributions to the world's &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; has acknowledged Afghanistan's role by declaring the &lt;a href=\"Minaret%20of%20Jam\"&gt;Minaret of Jam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buddhas%20of%20Bamiyan\"&gt;Buddhas of Bamiyan&lt;/a&gt; destroyed in 2001, &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20List\"&gt;World Heritage Sites&lt;/a&gt;.\nHousing.\n&lt;a href=\"Houses\"&gt;Houses&lt;/a&gt; in rural Afghanistan historically have been made of &lt;a href=\"mudbrick\"&gt;mudbrick&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, and have a series of rooms located around a private rectangular courtyard where women and children can move around without being seen by the public. In recent years, however, Afghans living in rural areas began building their homes using cement and &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt;s, similar as those built in the big cities. In the north and west they are typically in fortified villages called \"qalahs\" (\"fortresses\"), whereas in the mountainous northern and eastern regions they differ, for example &lt;a href=\"wooden\"&gt;wooden&lt;/a&gt; multistoried dwellings in Nuristan.\nMarried sons often share houses with their parents, but with separate quarters. Afghan houses contain a special room where men socialize with each other known as a \"hujra\". In the major cities, many Afghans live in modern houses or &lt;a href=\"apartments\"&gt;apartments&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"nomad\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"kuchi%20people\"&gt;kuchi people&lt;/a&gt; live in large tents because they are constantly on the move from one part of the country to another. The nomads of Turkic or Mongol origin in the north tend to live in &lt;a href=\"yurt\"&gt;yurt&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArt, weaving, ceramics.\nThe lands of Afghanistan have a long history of &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, with the world's earliest known usage of &lt;a href=\"oil%20painting\"&gt;oil painting&lt;/a&gt; found in cave murals in the country. Afghan art includes &lt;a href=\"Persian%20miniature\"&gt;Persian miniature&lt;/a&gt; style, with &lt;a href=\"Kam%C4%81l%20ud-D%C4%ABn%20Behz%C4%81d\"&gt;Kamaleddin Behzad&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Herat\"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt; being one of the most notable miniature artists of the &lt;a href=\"Timurid%20dynasty\"&gt;Timurid&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20dynasty\"&gt;Safavid&lt;/a&gt; periods. Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Ghafoor%20Breshna\"&gt;Abdul Ghafoor Breshna&lt;/a&gt; was a prominent Afghan painter and sketch artist from Kabul during the 20th century.\nAfghanistan's art was originally almost entirely done by men, but recently women are entering the arts programs at &lt;a href=\"Kabul%20University\"&gt;Kabul University&lt;/a&gt;. Art is largely centered at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;National Museum of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;National Gallery of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Archives%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;National Archives of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people to learn contemporary paintings.\nThe art of making &lt;a href=\"carpets\"&gt;carpets&lt;/a&gt; has been prominent for centuries. Afghanistan is known for making beautiful oriental rugs. The &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20carpet\"&gt;Afghan carpet&lt;/a&gt; has certain prints that make them unique to Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan is known for its production of &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20rug\"&gt;Afghan rug&lt;/a&gt;s, traditionally handwoven using a number of well-known and highly-prized patterns.\nCuisine.\nAfghanistan has a wide varying landscape allowing for many different crops. Afghan cuisine is based on cereals like &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, which are the nation's chief crops. Afghans do not eat &lt;a href=\"pungency\"&gt;spicy food&lt;/a&gt; like the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Pakistani%20cuisine\"&gt;Pakistanis&lt;/a&gt;. Fresh and dried fruits is the most important part of Afghan diet. Afghanistan is well known for its fine fruits, especially &lt;a href=\"Pomegranate%20production%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;pomegranates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grapes\"&gt;grapes&lt;/a&gt;, and its extra-sweet jumbo-size &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDress and attire.\nAfghan traditional dress typically covers the entire body with a loose top and a form of head covering. The dresses are very colorful, especially women's.\nSport.\nThe sports in Afghanistan are organized by the &lt;a href=\"Afghan%20Sports%20Federation\"&gt;Afghan Sports Federation&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%20handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taekwondo\"&gt;taekwondo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roller%20skating\"&gt;skating&lt;/a&gt; and several others.\nFootball remains to be the most popular sport across Afghanistan.The &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Afghanistan national football team&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1922, joined &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; in 1948 and the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; (AFC) in 1954. Although it did not play in any international games from 1984 to 2003 due to the war, it is now striving and hoping to make it to FIFA. The &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Afghanistan women's national football team&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 2007. The &lt;a href=\"Ghazi%20Stadium\"&gt;Ghazi Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which was built during the reign of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amanullah%20Khan\"&gt;Amanullah Khan&lt;/a&gt;, was once used for a venue for public executions by the Taliban government. The stadium is currently used mostly for football matches between teams from different provinces of the country as well as neighboring countries. &lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; has existed in Afghanistan since at least the 1970s, and is slowly becoming popular again. It is played by both Afghan men and women. Additionally, Afghans in the north of the country enjoy the sport of &lt;a href=\"buzkashi\"&gt;buzkashi&lt;/a&gt;.\nCricket has become popular in recent years in Afghanistan. The &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Afghanistan national cricket team&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed in 1996 during Taliban regime, has held matches against all other international cricket teams since 2001. The Afghan team rapidly rose through the &lt;a href=\"World%20Cricket%20League\"&gt;World Cricket League&lt;/a&gt; since early 2008. It participated in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20ICC%20World%20Cup%20Qualifier\"&gt;2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2010%20ICC%20World%20Cricket%20League%20Division%20One\"&gt;2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20\"&gt;2010 ICC World Twenty20&lt;/a&gt; where they played India and South Africa. The team won four times in a row, the &lt;a href=\"ACC%20Twenty20%20Cup\"&gt;ACC Twenty20 Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. It played against top ranking teams in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20ICC%20Under-19%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2012%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20\"&gt;2012 ICC World Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;. ts, Afghans usually play with challengers of neighboring states and sometimes with other Asian countries.\nReligion.\n&lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; is the main religion of Afghanistan and over 99.7% of Afghans are &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 84.7\u201390% of the population adhere to &lt;a href=\"Sunni%20Islam\"&gt;Sunni Islam&lt;/a&gt;, while an estimated 7\u201315% practice &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Shia Islam&lt;/a&gt;, and approximately 1% are followers of other religions. In pre-Islamic era, &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20and%20Buddhist%20heritage%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Bhuddism and Hinduism&lt;/a&gt; had a strong presence in \nAfghanistan; in addition, &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; have also had a &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;presence&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan for over a millennia.\nEducation.\n&lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Education in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;a href=\"K%E2%80%9312%20%28education%29\"&gt;K-12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"higher%20education\"&gt;higher education&lt;/a&gt;, which is supervised by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Afghanistan%29\"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Higher%20Education%20%28Afghanistan%29\"&gt;Ministry of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. There are about 10,000 schools of which 4,000 were built in the last decade. More than 100,000 teachers were trained and recruited in the same period. It was reported in 2011 that more than seven million male and female students were enrolled in schools. Some of the well known schools in Kabul are &lt;a href=\"Habibia%20High%20School\"&gt;Habibia High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyc%C3%A9e%20Esteqlal\"&gt;Lyc\u00e9e Esteqlal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20High%20School\"&gt;Amani High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aisha-i-Durani%20School\"&gt;Aisha-i-Durani School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghazi%20High%20School\"&gt;Ghazi High School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rahman%20Baba%20High%20School\"&gt;Rahman Baba High School&lt;/a&gt;. The Ahmad Shah Baba High School and Zarghuna Anna High School are two of the oldest schools in &lt;a href=\"Kandahar\"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers to help with this problem and promote American culture in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location. The military and national police are now provided with mandatory literacy courses. In addition to this, &lt;a href=\"Baghch-e-Simsim\"&gt;Baghch-e-Simsim&lt;/a&gt; (based on the American &lt;a href=\"Sesame%20Street\"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;) was launched in late 2011 to help Afghan children learn from &lt;a href=\"Preschool%20education\"&gt;preschool&lt;/a&gt; onward. Programs in the show \"will be partly filmed in Afghanistan with the rest\" lifted from other versions in &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20world\"&gt;Muslim countries&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigher education is provided by various &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20universities%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;universities&lt;/a&gt; throughout the country, which include the &lt;a href=\"American%20University%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;American University of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kabul%20University\"&gt;Kabul University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polytechnical%20University%20of%20Kabul\"&gt;Polytechnical University of Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herat%20University\"&gt;Herat University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balkh%20University\"&gt;Balkh University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nangarhar%20University\"&gt;Nangarhar University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kandahar%20University\"&gt;Kandahar University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khost%20University\"&gt;Khost University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bakhtar%20University\"&gt;Bakhtar University&lt;/a&gt;, and a heap of others. There is also one &lt;a href=\"National%20Military%20Academy%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;military college&lt;/a&gt;, located in Kabul. Recently with help from &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;, over 1,000 women have taken the university entrance exam. As of 2011, about 62,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country.\nGames.\n&lt;a href=\"Kite\"&gt;Kite&lt;/a&gt;s and \"&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20kite\"&gt;kite fighting&lt;/a&gt;\" are highly popular in Afghanistan especially amongst children.\nHolidays.\nReligious.\nAfghanistan's religious holidays are nearly the same as &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20holidays\"&gt;Islamic holidays&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most important include &lt;a href=\"Eid%20al-Fitr\"&gt;Eid al-Fitr&lt;/a&gt; (end of &lt;a href=\"Ramadan\"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Eid%20al-Adha\"&gt;Eid al-Adha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Ashura\"&gt;Ashura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mawlid\"&gt;Mawlid&lt;/a&gt;, while the religious minorities of Afghanistan celebrate holidays unique to their respective religion.\nTraditional.\nFarmer's Day, also known as &lt;a href=\"Nauruz%20in%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Nauruz&lt;/a&gt; (Nowruz), is an ancient annual Afghan festival which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;New Year&lt;/a&gt;. The observances usually last two weeks, culminating on the first day of the Afghan New Year, March 21, and corresponds to the first day of the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Calendar\"&gt;Persian Calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nNauruz is related to a religion called &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrianism\"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt; which was in practice in ancient &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt; before the emergence of Islam. This festival is to celebrate the arrival of spring as plants, trees, and flowers start to bloom making the weather pleasant. On the day of Nauruz, families usually celebrate the festival by cooking food and going out for a picnic. Families cook various kinds of meals, Samanak, and Haft-mewah or dry fruits that start with the letter (\u0633) or (S) which represents the arrival of spring season. Haft-mewah contains seven dry fruits which families place in warm water two to three days before Nauruz. Samanak is another type of dessert made from wheat and sugar. Women usually get together days before Nauruz to prepare Samanak. They pour the ingredients into a big pot placed on an open fire and take turns to stir the wheat and sugar in the pot before it turns into a thick paste. Once prepared, the dessert is then served on the day of Nauruz."
