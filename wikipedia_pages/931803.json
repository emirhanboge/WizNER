    "text": "The Military Pentathlon is a &lt;a href=\"Multisport%20race\"&gt;multisport&lt;/a&gt;. It resembles the &lt;a href=\"modern%20pentathlon\"&gt;modern pentathlon&lt;/a&gt; but updated to skills used by the modern military.\nHistory of the Military Pentathlon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"modern%20pentathlon\"&gt;modern pentathlon&lt;/a&gt; was originally designed to include the ideal skills of a soldier of the time. By the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, some of those skills (&lt;a href=\"fencing\"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"horse%20riding\"&gt;horse riding&lt;/a&gt;) were irrelevant to the modern soldier.\nIn 1946 a French officer, Captain &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Debrus\"&gt;Henri Debrus&lt;/a&gt; (later promoted Colonel and President of the &lt;a href=\"Conseil%20International%20du%20Sport%20Militaire\"&gt;Conseil International du Sport Militaire&lt;/a&gt; (CISM)) conceived the idea of organising a sports competition reserved exclusively for the army. It was during discussions held at &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20am%20Main\"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt; which led to the setting up of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Military%20Sports%20Council%23Allied%20Forces%20Sports%20Council\"&gt;Allied Forces Sports Council&lt;/a&gt;, that his attention was drawn to an original military physical training technique used, at that time, by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Netherlands%20Army\"&gt;Netherlands airborne units&lt;/a&gt;. After being dropped over a given zone, &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachutists&lt;/a&gt; had to travel a distance of twenty kilometres from the dropping point, crossing over a number of obstacles and performing combat operations (&lt;a href=\"small%20arms\"&gt;small arms&lt;/a&gt; fire and &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; throwing).\nCaptain Debrus took the Dutch method as a guide, eliminated the parachute jump and modified the other tests in order to form a system, which he thought, would constitute an ideal way of ground training. A first trial competition organised by himself was held at the Military Physical Training Centre, at &lt;a href=\"Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau\"&gt;Freiburg&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allied-occupied%20Germany\"&gt;occupation zone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, in August 1947. Only &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, and French teams took part in the competition.\nSince 1950, annual world championships have been held. The sport has grown in popularity, and now over 30 countries participate. The sport's governing body, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Military%20Sports%20Council\"&gt;International Military Sports Council&lt;/a&gt; (CISM), now also organise &lt;a href=\"pentathlon\"&gt;pentathlon&lt;/a&gt;s aimed at &lt;a href=\"navy\"&gt;naval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt; personnel.\nEvents of the military pentathlon.\nShooting.\nThe shooting discipline consists of sighting shots and competition shooting.\nThe shooting competition consists of:\nObstacle run.\nThe length of the course is 500 metres and consists of 20 standardised obstacles.\nThe contest is to be held on one or several lanes, provided that all lanes are identical. Each competitor must follow his own lane.\nObstacles: the obstacles are constructed and placed on the track. Obstacles of men's event consist of:\nIn the women's event, the rope ladder, sloping wall with rope, four steps of beams and vertical ladder are not negotiated.\nObstacle swimming.\n50 metres with four obstacles.\nThrowing.\nThe weight of projectiles is 575 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for men and 375 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for women.\nThrowing consists of precision throwing at distances of 20, 25, 30 and 35 metres (five metres shorter for each target for females). The targets consist of an inner circle with radius of one metre, and an outer circle with radius of two metres. The time allotted for precision throwing is three minutes, 16 projectiles with four inactive &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;s on each target.\nDistance throwing is also included, where competitors throw three grenades in two minutes. Only the longest throw will count toward the score, which combines points for both distance and precision.\nCross-country running.\nThe cross-country running is the last event and for men the distance is 8000m and for women the distance is 4000m."
