    "text": "The gravitational constant (also known as the universal gravitational constant, the Newtonian constant of gravitation, or the Cavendish gravitational constant), denoted by the capital letter , is an &lt;a href=\"empirical\"&gt;empirical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physical%20constant\"&gt;physical constant&lt;/a&gt; involved in the calculation of &lt;a href=\"gravitational\"&gt;gravitational&lt;/a&gt; effects in &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Sir Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation\"&gt;law of universal gravitation&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"general%20relativity\"&gt;general theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Newton's law, it is the proportionality constant connecting the &lt;a href=\"gravitational%20force\"&gt;gravitational force&lt;/a&gt; between two bodies with the product of their &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es and the &lt;a href=\"inverse-square%20law\"&gt;inverse square&lt;/a&gt; of their &lt;a href=\"distance\"&gt;distance&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Einstein%20field%20equations\"&gt;Einstein field equations&lt;/a&gt;, it quantifies the relation between the geometry of spacetime and the energy\u2013momentum tensor (also referred to as the &lt;a href=\"stress%E2%80%93energy%20tensor\"&gt;stress\u2013energy tensor&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe measured value of the constant is known with some certainty to four significant digits. In &lt;a href=\"SI%20units\"&gt;SI units&lt;/a&gt;, its value is approximately \nThe modern notation of Newton's law involving was introduced in the 1890s by &lt;a href=\"C.%20V.%20Boys\"&gt;C. V. Boys&lt;/a&gt;. The first implicit measurement with an accuracy within about 1% is attributed to &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Cavendish\"&gt;Henry Cavendish&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Cavendish%20experiment\"&gt;1798 experiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinition.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation\"&gt;Newton's law of universal gravitation&lt;/a&gt;, the attractive &lt;a href=\"force\"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; () between two &lt;a href=\"Point%20particle\"&gt;point-like bodies&lt;/a&gt; is directly proportional to the product of their &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es ( and ) and &lt;a href=\"Inverse-square%20law\"&gt;inversely proportional to the square of the distance&lt;/a&gt;, , between their centers of mass.:\nformula_1\nThe &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;constant of proportionality&lt;/a&gt;, , is the gravitational constant. Colloquially, the gravitational constant is also called \"Big G\", distinct from \"small g\" (), which is the &lt;a href=\"Gravity%20of%20Earth\"&gt;local gravitational field of Earth&lt;/a&gt; (equivalent to the free-fall acceleration). Where formula_2 is the &lt;a href=\"mass%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;mass of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; and formula_3 is the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20radius\"&gt;radius of the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the two quantities are related by:\nformula_4\nThe gravitational constant appears in the &lt;a href=\"Einstein%20field%20equations\"&gt;Einstein field equations&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"general%20relativity\"&gt;general relativity&lt;/a&gt;,\nformula_5\nwhere is the &lt;a href=\"Einstein%20tensor\"&gt;Einstein tensor&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"cosmological%20constant\"&gt;cosmological constant&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"metric%20tensor%20%28general%20relativity%29\"&gt;metric tensor&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"stress%E2%80%93energy%20tensor\"&gt;stress\u2013energy tensor&lt;/a&gt;, and is a constant originally introduced by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; that is directly related to the Newtonian constant of gravitation:.\nformula_6\nValue and uncertainty.\nThe gravitational constant is a physical constant that is difficult to measure with high accuracy. This is because the gravitational force is an extremely weak force as compared to other &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20forces\"&gt;fundamental forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"International%20System%20of%20Units\"&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt; units, the 2018 &lt;a href=\"Committee%20on%20Data%20for%20Science%20and%20Technology\"&gt;CODATA&lt;/a&gt;-recommended value of the gravitational constant (with &lt;a href=\"standard%20uncertainty\"&gt;standard uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; in parentheses) is:\nformula_7 \nThis corresponds to a relative standard &lt;a href=\"Measurement%20uncertainty\"&gt;uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; of (22 &lt;a href=\"Parts%20per%20million\"&gt;ppm&lt;/a&gt;).\nNatural units.\nThe gravitational constant is a defining constant in some systems of &lt;a href=\"natural%20units\"&gt;natural units&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"geometrized%20unit%20system\"&gt;geometrized unit system&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Planck%20units\"&gt;Planck units&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoney%20units\"&gt;Stoney units&lt;/a&gt;. When expressed in terms of such units, the value of the gravitational constant will generally have a numeric value of 1 or a value close to it. Due to the significant uncertainty in the measured value of \"G\" in terms of other known fundamental constants, a similar level of uncertainty will show up in the value of many quantities when expressed in such a unit system.\nOrbital mechanics.\nIn &lt;a href=\"astrophysics\"&gt;astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, it is convenient to measure distances in &lt;a href=\"parsec\"&gt;parsec&lt;/a&gt;s (pc), velocities in kilometres per second (km/s) and masses in &lt;a href=\"Solar%20mass\"&gt;solar units&lt;/a&gt; . In these units, the gravitational constant is:\nformula_8\nFor situations where tides are important, the relevant length scales are &lt;a href=\"solar%20radius\"&gt;solar radii&lt;/a&gt; rather than parsecs. In these units, the gravitational constant is:\nformula_9\nIn &lt;a href=\"orbital%20mechanics\"&gt;orbital mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, the period of an object in circular orbit around a spherical object obeys\nformula_10\nwhere is the volume inside the radius of the orbit. It follows that\nThis way of expressing shows the relationship between the average density of a planet and the period of a satellite orbiting just above its surface.\nFor elliptical orbits, applying &lt;a href=\"Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion%23Third%20law\"&gt;Kepler's 3rd law&lt;/a&gt;, expressed in units characteristic of &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20orbit\"&gt;Earth's orbit&lt;/a&gt;:\nwhere distance is measured in terms of the &lt;a href=\"semi-major%20axis\"&gt;semi-major axis&lt;/a&gt; of Earth's orbit (the &lt;a href=\"astronomical%20unit\"&gt;astronomical unit&lt;/a&gt;, AU), time in &lt;a href=\"solar%20year\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;s, and mass in the total mass of the orbiting system ().\nThe above equation is exact only within the approximation of the Earth's orbit around the Sun as a &lt;a href=\"two-body%20problem\"&gt;two-body problem&lt;/a&gt; in Newtonian mechanics, the measured quantities contain corrections from the perturbations from other bodies in the solar system and from general relativity.\nFrom 1964 until 2012, however, it was used as the definition of the astronomical unit and thus held by definition: \nformula_13 \nSince 2012, the AU is defined as exactly, and the equation can no longer be taken as holding precisely.\nThe quantity \u2014the product of the gravitational constant and the mass of a given astronomical body such as the Sun or Earth\u2014is known as the standard gravitational parameter (also denoted ). The standard gravitational parameter appears as above in Newton's law of universal gravitation, as well as in formulas for the deflection of light caused by &lt;a href=\"gravitational%20lensing\"&gt;gravitational lensing&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion\"&gt;Kepler's laws of planetary motion&lt;/a&gt;, and in the formula for &lt;a href=\"escape%20velocity\"&gt;escape velocity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quantity gives a convenient simplification of various gravity-related formulas. The product is known much more accurately than either factor is.\nCalculations in &lt;a href=\"celestial%20mechanics\"&gt;celestial mechanics&lt;/a&gt; can also be carried out using the units of &lt;a href=\"solar%20mass\"&gt;solar mass&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"mean%20solar%20day\"&gt;mean solar day&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"astronomical%20unit\"&gt;astronomical unit&lt;/a&gt;s rather than standard SI units. For this purpose, the &lt;a href=\"Gaussian%20gravitational%20constant\"&gt;Gaussian gravitational constant&lt;/a&gt; was historically in widespread use, , expressing the mean &lt;a href=\"angular%20velocity\"&gt;angular velocity&lt;/a&gt; of the Sun\u2013Earth system measured in &lt;a href=\"radian\"&gt;radian&lt;/a&gt;s per &lt;a href=\"day\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;. The use of this constant, and the implied definition of the &lt;a href=\"astronomical%20unit\"&gt;astronomical unit&lt;/a&gt; discussed above, has been deprecated by the &lt;a href=\"IAU\"&gt;IAU&lt;/a&gt; since 2012.\nHistory of measurement.\nEarly history.\nThe existence of the constant is implied in &lt;a href=\"Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation\"&gt;Newton's law of universal gravitation&lt;/a&gt; as published in the 1680s (although its notation as dates to the 1890s), but is not &lt;a href=\"Algebra%23Algebra%20as%20a%20branch%20of%20mathematics\"&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; in his \"&lt;a href=\"Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica\"&gt;Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica&lt;/a&gt;\" where it postulates the &lt;a href=\"inverse-square%20law\"&gt;inverse-square law&lt;/a&gt; of gravitation. In the \"Principia\", Newton considered the possibility of measuring gravity's strength by measuring the deflection of a pendulum in the vicinity of a large hill, but thought that the effect would be too small to be measurable. Nevertheless, he estimated the order of magnitude of the constant when he surmised that \"the mean density of the earth might be five or six times as great as the density of water\", which is equivalent to a gravitational constant of the order:\nA measurement was attempted in 1738 by &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Bouguer\"&gt;Pierre Bouguer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Marie%20de%20La%20Condamine\"&gt;Charles Marie de La Condamine&lt;/a&gt; in their \"&lt;a href=\"French%20Geodesic%20Mission\"&gt;Peruvian expedition&lt;/a&gt;\". Bouguer downplayed the significance of their results in 1740, suggesting that the experiment had at least proved that the Earth could not be a &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Earth\"&gt;hollow shell&lt;/a&gt;, as some thinkers of the day, including &lt;a href=\"Edmond%20Halley\"&gt;Edmond Halley&lt;/a&gt;, had suggested.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Schiehallion%20experiment\"&gt;Schiehallion experiment&lt;/a&gt;, proposed in 1772 and completed in 1776, was the first successful measurement of the mean density of the Earth, and thus indirectly of the gravitational constant. The result reported by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Hutton\"&gt;Charles Hutton&lt;/a&gt; (1778) suggested a density of ( times the density of water), about 20% below the modern value. This immediately led to estimates on the densities and masses of the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"planets\"&gt;planets&lt;/a&gt;, sent by Hutton to &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lalande\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande&lt;/a&gt; for inclusion in his planetary tables. As discussed above, establishing the average density of Earth is equivalent to measuring the gravitational constant, given &lt;a href=\"Earth%20radius%23Mean%20radius\"&gt;Earth's mean radius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"little%20g\"&gt;mean gravitational acceleration&lt;/a&gt; at Earth's surface, by setting\nformula_14\nBased on this, Hutton's 1778 result is equivalent to \u2248 .\nThe first direct measurement of gravitational attraction between two bodies in the laboratory was performed in 1798, seventy-one years after Newton's death, by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Cavendish\"&gt;Henry Cavendish&lt;/a&gt;. He determined a value for implicitly, using a &lt;a href=\"Torsion%20spring%23Torsion%20balance\"&gt;torsion balance&lt;/a&gt; invented by the geologist Rev. &lt;a href=\"John%20Michell\"&gt;John Michell&lt;/a&gt; (1753). He used a horizontal &lt;a href=\"torsion%20beam\"&gt;torsion beam&lt;/a&gt; with lead balls whose inertia (in relation to the torsion constant) he could tell by timing the beam's oscillation. Their faint attraction to other balls placed alongside the beam was detectable by the deflection it caused. In spite of the experimental design being due to Michell, the experiment is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Cavendish%20experiment\"&gt;Cavendish experiment&lt;/a&gt; for its first successful execution by Cavendish.\nCavendish's stated aim was the \"weighing of Earth\", that is, determining the average density of Earth and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%27s%20mass\"&gt;Earth's mass&lt;/a&gt;. His result, \"\u03c1\"\ud83d\udf28 = , corresponds to value of = . It is surprisingly accurate, about 1% above the modern value (comparable to the claimed standard uncertainty of 0.6%).\n19th century.\nThe accuracy of the measured value of has increased only modestly since the original Cavendish experiment. is quite difficult to measure because gravity is much weaker than other fundamental forces, and an experimental apparatus cannot be separated from the gravitational influence of other bodies. \nMeasurements with pendulums were made by &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Carlini\"&gt;Francesco Carlini&lt;/a&gt; (1821, ), &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Sabine\"&gt;Edward Sabine&lt;/a&gt; (1827, ), Carlo Ignazio Giulio (1841, ) and &lt;a href=\"George%20Biddell%20Airy\"&gt;George Biddell Airy&lt;/a&gt; (1854, ).\nCavendish's experiment was first repeated by &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Reich\"&gt;Ferdinand Reich&lt;/a&gt; (1838, 1842, 1853), who found a value of , which is actually worse than Cavendish's result, differing from the modern value by 1.5%. Cornu and Baille (1873), found .\nCavendish's experiment proved to result in more reliable measurements than pendulum experiments of the \"Schiehallion\" (deflection) type or \"Peruvian\" (period as a function of altitude) type. Pendulum experiments still continued to be performed, by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20von%20Sterneck\"&gt;Robert von Sterneck&lt;/a&gt; (1883, results between 5.0 and ) and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Corwin%20Mendenhall\"&gt;Thomas Corwin Mendenhall&lt;/a&gt; (1880, ).\nCavendish's result was first improved upon by &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Poynting\"&gt;John Henry Poynting&lt;/a&gt; (1891), who published a value of , differing from the modern value by 0.2%, but compatible with the modern value within the cited standard uncertainty of 0.55%. In addition to Poynting, measurements were made by &lt;a href=\"C.%20V.%20Boys\"&gt;C. V. Boys&lt;/a&gt; (1895) and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Braun%20%28astronomer%29\"&gt;Carl Braun&lt;/a&gt; (1897), with compatible results suggesting = . The modern notation involving the constant was introduced by Boys in 1894 and becomes standard by the end of the 1890s, with values usually cited in the &lt;a href=\"cgs\"&gt;cgs&lt;/a&gt; system. Richarz and Krigar-Menzel (1898) attempted a repetition of the Cavendish experiment using 100,000\u00a0kg of lead for the attracting mass. The precision of their result of was, however, of the same order of magnitude as the other results at the time.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Stanley%20Mackenzie\"&gt;Arthur Stanley Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt; in \"The Laws of Gravitation\" (1899) reviews the work done in the 19th century. Poynting is the author of the article \"Gravitation\" in the &lt;a href=\"Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition\"&gt;\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition&lt;/a&gt; (1911). Here, he cites a value of = with an uncertainty of 0.2%.\nModern value.\n&lt;a href=\"Paul%20R.%20Heyl\"&gt;Paul R. Heyl&lt;/a&gt; (1930) published the value of (relative uncertainty 0.1%), improved to (relative uncertainty 0.045% = 450 ppm) in 1942.\nPublished values of derived from high-precision measurements since the 1950s have remained compatible with Heyl (1930), but within the relative uncertainty of about 0.1% (or 1,000 ppm) have varied rather broadly, and it is not entirely clear if the uncertainty has been reduced at all since the 1942 measurement. Some measurements published in the 1980s to 2000s were, in fact, mutually exclusive. Establishing a standard value for with a standard uncertainty better than 0.1% has therefore remained rather speculative.\nBy 1969, the value recommended by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology\"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST) was cited with a standard uncertainty of 0.046% (460 ppm), lowered to 0.012% (120 ppm) by 1986. But the continued publication of conflicting measurements led NIST to considerably increase the standard uncertainty in the 1998 recommended value, by a factor of 12, to a standard uncertainty of 0.15%, larger than the one given by Heyl (1930).\nThe uncertainty was again lowered in 2002 and 2006, but once again raised, by a more conservative 20%, in 2010, matching the standard uncertainty of 120\u00a0ppm published in 1986. For the 2014 update, CODATA reduced the uncertainty to 46 ppm, less than half the 2010 value, and one order of magnitude below the 1969 recommendation.\nThe following table shows the NIST recommended values published since 1969:\nIn the January 2007 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Science%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;\", Fixler et al. described a measurement of the gravitational constant by a new technique, &lt;a href=\"atom%20interferometry\"&gt;atom interferometry&lt;/a&gt;, reporting a value of , 0.28% (2800 ppm) higher than the 2006 CODATA value. An improved cold atom measurement by Rosi et al. was published in 2014 of . Although much closer to the accepted value (suggesting that the Fixler \"et. al.\" measurement was erroneous), this result was 325\u00a0ppm below the recommended 2014 CODATA value, with non-overlapping &lt;a href=\"standard%20uncertainty\"&gt;standard uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; intervals.\nAs of 2018, efforts to re-evaluate the conflicting results of measurements are underway, coordinated by NIST, notably a repetition of the experiments reported by Quinn et al. (2013).\nIn August 2018, a Chinese research group announced new measurements based on torsion balances, and based on two different methods. These are claimed as the most accurate measurements ever made, with a standard uncertainties cited as low as 12\u00a0ppm. The difference of 2.7&lt;a href=\"standard%20deviation\"&gt;\u03c3&lt;/a&gt; between the two results suggests there could be sources of error unaccounted for.\nSuggested time-variation.\nA controversial 2015 study of some previous measurements of , by Anderson et al., suggested that most of the mutually exclusive values in high-precision measurements of \"G\" can be explained by a &lt;a href=\"time-variation%20of%20physical%20constants\"&gt;periodic variation&lt;/a&gt;. The variation was measured as having a period of 5.9 years, similar to that observed in length-of-day (LOD) measurements, hinting at a common physical cause that is not necessarily a variation in . A response was produced by some of the original authors of the measurements used in Anderson et al. This response notes that Anderson et al. not only omitted measurements, but that they also used the time of publication rather than the time the experiments were performed. A plot with estimated time of measurement from contacting original authors seriously degrades the length of day correlation. Also, consideration of the data collected over a decade by Karagioz and Izmailov shows no correlation with length of day measurements. As such, the variations in most likely arise from systematic measurement errors which have not properly been accounted for. Under the assumption that the physics of &lt;a href=\"type%20Ia%20supernovae\"&gt;type Ia supernovae&lt;/a&gt; are universal, analysis of observations of 580 of them has shown that the gravitational constant has varied by less than one part in ten billion per year over the last nine billion years according to Mould et al. (2014).\nReferences.\nFootnotes\nCitations"
