    "text": "The Dunham Tavern, also known as the Dunham Tavern Museum, is the oldest building in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, located at 6709 &lt;a href=\"Euclid%20Avenue%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Euclid Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. Rufus and Jane Pratt Dunham built their first home on the site in 1824, and the existing taproom was built in 1842. It is believed to be the first building constructed on &lt;a href=\"Euclid%20Avenue%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Ohio%29\"&gt;Euclid Avenue&lt;/a&gt; east of East 55th Street and the first frame house on the street. It later became a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; stop and &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nRestoration.\nCleveland activist and landscape architect, &lt;a href=\"A.%20Donald%20Gray\"&gt;A. Donald Gray&lt;/a&gt; purchased the home in 1932, restoring the 19th century architecture and replanting the orchard. Gray later established a non-profit organization tasked with maintaining the property. The home was re-opened as the Dunham Tavern Museum in 1941.\nIn 1982, the two non-profit organizations that cared for the property \u2013 Dunham Tavern, Inc. (est. by Gray in 1936) and the Society of Collectors, Inc. (which assumed responsibility for the tavern in 1941) \u2013 merged into one corporate entity, the Corp. of Dunham Tavern Museum.\nLandmark Status.\nThe Dunham Tavern was named a Cleveland Landmark in 1973 and added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on July 25, 1974."
