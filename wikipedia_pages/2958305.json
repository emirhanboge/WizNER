    "text": "Club Sportiv Municipal Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b, commonly known as Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b () or simply as Ceahl\u0103ul, is a Romanian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28organization%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Piatra%20Neam%C8%9B\"&gt;Piatra Neam\u021b&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neam%C8%9B%20County\"&gt;Neam\u021b County&lt;/a&gt;, currently playing in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Liga III&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally established in 1919, the team's name stems from the not far off &lt;a href=\"Ceahl%C4%83u%20Massif\"&gt;Ceahl\u0103u Massif&lt;/a&gt;. \"Nem\u021benii\" made their first appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Romanian top division&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1993\u201394 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club plays its home matches in black and yellow kits at the 18,000-seater &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Ceahl%C4%83ul\"&gt;Stadionul Ceahl\u0103ul&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1919\u20131961).\nDespite the fact that &lt;a href=\"Piatra%20Neam%C8%9B\"&gt;Piatra Neam\u021b&lt;/a&gt;, a town of 85,055 inhabitants (2011 census), has never been historically a landmark of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt; being in the shadow of important cultural and economic centers such as: &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gala%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Gala\u021bi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bac%C4%83u\"&gt;Bac\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, it can boast with a major thing having the oldest football club from the region.\nCeahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b was born on 20 October 1919, the club's setting-up meeting taking place in the amphitheater of the \"Petru Rare\u0219\" High School. The steering committee at that time was made up of: M.Stamatiu \u2013 Honorary president, Gh. Gheorghiu \u2013 President, M.Stati \u2013 Vice-President, O.Leca \u2013 cashier, N.Stati \u2013 Secretary. The squad of the high school has been strengthened with soldiers of the 15th Infantry Regiment, returned from the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; front: cpt. \u021aicleanu, lt. Tane S\u0103vulescu, lt. Mare\u0219, N.Sec\u0103reanu, lt. Cosara and Mavrosca. Until 1926 Ceahl\u0103ul had an important activity on regional level and in the championship of Moldavia, which they also won in 1926. In 1927 the players, most of them students went to college and for the club followed a period of decline, with a &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Divizia C&lt;/a&gt; presence in the 1937\u201338 season, but unsettled to the end due to lack of a proper financial situation. After years of inconsistency in terms of sports results, in 1939 &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; broke out, and football went on the second place, both in Piatra Neam\u021b and in Romania.\nAfter the end of the war Ceahl\u0103ul appeared again in 1947, this time with a new team which included following players: Vulovici, B\u0103l\u0103nescu, Ciciuc (Popovici), Actis, Manoliu, D\u0103sc\u0103lescu, Vasiliu, Georgescu, Mata, Butnaru and Chiper.\nIn 1949 Ceahl\u0103ul changed its name to \"Progresul Piatra Neam\u021b\", change that does not last long, Progresul being transformed in \"Av\u00e2ntul Piatra Neam\u021b\" two years later. The 1950s were marked by a period of instability, with numerous changes within the team, from the name to its structure and players. This period was in fact the period of the birth of the modern Ceahl\u0103ul. &lt;a href=\"Piatra%20Neam%C8%9B\"&gt;Piatra Neam\u021b&lt;/a&gt; had at that time three football clubs: \"Av\u00e2ntul\" (today known as Ceahl\u0103ul), H\u00e2rtia (paper mill team) and Celuloza (another team related with the paper mill), but all of them with oscillating results, generally marked by a presence somewhere at the level of the lower leagues. In 1956 \"Av\u00e2ntul\", H\u00e2rtia and Celuloza merged and \"Recolta Piatra Neam\u021b\" was born. As \"Recolta\" the team resisted only one season in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Divizia C&lt;/a&gt; finishing 11th out of 12. At the end of the season \"Recolta\" broke in two new teams: \"Av\u00e2ntul\" and \"Rapid\". After a season of poor performances, the two teams realized that they can get better results together and merged again in 1958, this time as \"CS Piatra Neam\u021b\".\nThis last merge was a crucial moment, in fact the moment when professional football started his ascension in the city below Pietricica Mountain, when all the football forces in town came together. The board of directors was formed by: M.Weiss \u2013 President, dr. C.Andone, F.C\u00e2rlan, N.Pahoncea \u2013 Vice-Presidents. The first presence of the new team was in the 1958\u201359 Divizia C season, when it finished on the 3rd place. After another two seasons in the third league \"CS Piatra Neam\u021b\", promoted at the end of the 1960\u201361 season in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time in the club's history. The squad was composed of coach Tiberiu C\u0103p\u0103\u0163\u00een\u0103 and the following players: Apopei, Albu, Bonciu, Buc\u0219e, Croitoru, Gheghe\u0219an, Hrencic, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Lemnr\u0103u, Macri, Meder, Mihalache, Popa, Simion and Vintil\u0103.\nCeahl\u0103ul, 30 years of second league (1961\u20131993).\nIn the summer of 1961, along with the promotion, the club changed its name again, back to Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b.\nThe club played three consecutive seasons at this level obtaining the following results: 1961\u201362 \u2013 8th, 1962\u201363 \u2013 10th and 1963\u201364 \u2013 13th. Relegated to Divizia C, Ceahl\u0103ul it turned out to be a strong team and promoted back after only one season, ending the championship on the 1st place, with 4 points more than 2nd place, Textila Buhu\u0219i.\nAfter this last promotion, Ceahl\u0103ul would remain for a long time at the level of the second league (with the exception of a new Divizia C season between 1979 and 1980), being a recognized and respected team at this level. In the following four seasons, the team ranked in the first or at worst, in the middle part of the table: 1965\u201366 \u2013 7th, 1966\u201367 \u2013 9th, 1967\u201368 \u2013 5th and 1968\u201369 \u2013 5th, in this last season, when they equaled the best performance up to that point, achieved just one year before, the team was coached by the well-known &lt;a href=\"Petre%20Steinbach\"&gt;Petre Steinbach&lt;/a&gt; and the squad included players such as: Mitrofan, Arge\u0219anu, Olteanu, Iencsi, Gheorghe, Zaharia, Dragu, Seceleanu, Onica, Negustoru, P\u0103tra\u0219cu, Meder, Cioc\u00e2rlan or Ni\u0163\u0103.\nAfter his departure, the team had a fall and finished the 1969\u201370 season only in the 12th place, but enough to ensure its participation in the next edition of the championship. Followed a few seasons with mediocre rankings: 1970\u201371 \u2013 8th, 1971\u201372 \u2013 10th, 1972\u201373 \u2013 13th and 1973\u201374 \u2013 6th.\nIn the 1974\u201375 season the squad had a great course under the coach Al.Constantinescu, surpassing their best performance ever until then and finishing the championship on the 4th place, at only 1 point behind 3rd place (&lt;a href=\"SCM%20Gloria%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Gloria Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;) and 4 points behind the 2nd place (&lt;a href=\"ACS%20Dacia%20Unirea%20Br%C4%83ila\"&gt;Progresul Br\u0103ila&lt;/a&gt;). As well as at its last notable performance the team fell in the following seasons, occupying places in the middle to bottom area of the league table: 1975\u201376 \u2013 13th, 1976\u201377 \u2013 10th and 1977\u201378 \u2013 12th.\nIn the summer of 1978 the club changed its name from Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b to \"Relon Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b\" and made one of the weakest seasons since its last promotion in 1965, finishing on the 15th place out of 18 and relegating to Divizia C, after 14 years in the second league. To note the more than tight league table of the first series in that season, between 4th place (&lt;a href=\"SSC%20Farul%20Constan%C8%9Ba\"&gt;FC Constan\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;) and 17th place (&lt;a href=\"Club%20Sportiv%20Sporting%20Tecuci\"&gt;Victoria Tecuci&lt;/a&gt;) being a difference of just 6 points.\nIn the summer of 1979 \"Relon Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b\" changed its name again, back to the old one, Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b. Ceahl\u0103ul turned out to be again a much stronger team that the level of the third league and promoted back in the second league after only one season, finishing the 1st, with 7 points more than the 2nd place, occupied by &lt;a href=\"Foresta%20F%C4%83lticeni\"&gt;Foresta F\u0103lticeni&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in the Divizia B, Ceahl\u0103ul started with a new coach, &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20Dumitriu\"&gt;Dumitru Dumitriu&lt;/a&gt;, but also started again its middle table evolutions: 1980\u201381 \u2013 9th, 1981\u201382 \u2013 10th and 1982\u201383 \u2013 7th. In 1983 V.Copil was hired as the new coach and the team seemed to regain its second league glory after a 4th place occupied at the end of the 1983\u201384 season. After this result, which was the best in the history of the club, until then, Ceahl\u0103ul started to re-establish itself in the area that seemed to best characterize it, the middle of the ranking: 1984\u201385 \u2013 11th, 1985\u201386 \u2013 11th, 1986\u201387 \u2013 8th, 1987\u201388 \u2013 9th and 1988\u201389 \u2013 11th. The midlife of the team in the second half of the 1980s was almost to turn into a new relegation at the end of the 1989\u201390 season, when \"the Yellow and Blacks\" finished only on the 14th place, just above the relegation line, at the same number of points (31) with Siretul Pa\u0219cani, first team located in the red zone. That season was a disconcerting one for the most of the teams in Romania, due to the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Revolution\"&gt;1989 Romanian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt;, facts that changed all the structures in the country.\nIf for many teams, representatives of the ruling communist forces, such as: &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Victoria Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Flac%C4%83ra%20Moreni\"&gt;Flac\u0103ra Moreni&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"FC%20Olt%20Scornice%C8%99ti\"&gt;Olt Scornice\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, among others, the 1989 revolution was the beginning of the end, for Ceahl\u0103ul it was a real restart. From an already mediocre Divizia B team, \"the Yellow and Blacks\" started to battle with their old records, knocking more and more on the first league's door. First signs that Ceahl\u0103ul was no more a middle rank team was in the 1990\u201391 season when they finished 3rd at only 3 points from the second place. They would equalize their record again, a season later, another 3rd place, even if this time in the third series of the second league, at 3 points from the 2nd place (&lt;a href=\"FC%20Minerul%20Baia%20Mare\"&gt;FC Baia Mare&lt;/a&gt;) and 10 points over Metrom Bra\u0219ov.\nIn the summer of 1992 &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Sdrobi%C8%99\"&gt;Ioan Sdrobi\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, the one who is nicknamed \"The Father\", a coach who is well known for promoting young players in his teams, was hired as the new manager of the team below Pietricica Mountain. Also Gheorghe \u0218tefan has become the new president and the team was moved again in the first series, where &lt;a href=\"FC%20Arge%C8%99%20Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;FC Arge\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ASA%20T%C3%A2rgu%20Mure%C8%99%20%281962%29\"&gt;ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SCM%20Gloria%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Gloria Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Ia%C8%99i%20%281945%29\"&gt;Politehnica Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt; were announced as redoubtable opponents in the fight for promotion. The fight was hard with the remark that in the fight appeared two teams closely related to the former political regime: Steaua Mizil (&lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; satellite team at that moment) and &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Flac%C4%83ra%20Moreni\"&gt;Flac\u0103ra Moreni&lt;/a&gt;. During the winter break Sdrobi\u0219 left the team on the 1st place, after some disputes with \u0218tefan and signed with &lt;a href=\"ACS%20Dacia%20Unirea%20Br%C4%83ila\"&gt;Dacia Unirea Br\u0103ila&lt;/a&gt;. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Fenerbah\u00e7e&lt;/a&gt; former player, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Nunweiller\"&gt;Ion Nunweiller&lt;/a&gt;. In the end \"the Yellow and Blacks\" promoted to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time in the club's history, with 20 victories, 7 draws, 7 defeats, 54 goals scored and 24 conceded, 47 points, 6 over the next three teams: Steaua Mizil, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Arge%C8%99%20Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;FC Arge\u0219&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CSM%20Flac%C4%83ra%20Moreni\"&gt;Flac\u0103ra Moreni&lt;/a&gt;. The team was made up of &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Sdrobi%C8%99\"&gt;Ioan Sdrobi\u0219&lt;/a&gt; (rounds 1\u201317) and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Nunweiller\"&gt;Ion Nunweiller&lt;/a&gt; (rounds 18\u201334) as coaches and the following players: Anghelinei, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20%C8%98oiman\"&gt;\u0218oiman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Axinia\"&gt;Axinia I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Axinia\"&gt;Axinia II&lt;/a&gt;, Dinu, Alexa, Cozma, G\u0103lan, Co\u0219erariu, &lt;a href=\"Costel%20Enache\"&gt;Enache&lt;/a&gt;, B\u00e2rc\u0103, Ghioane, Grosu, Ivanov, &lt;a href=\"Gigi%20Ion\"&gt;Gigi Ion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Dan%20Ionescu\"&gt;Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Lefter\"&gt;Lefter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ovidiu%20Marc\"&gt;Ov. Marc&lt;/a&gt;, Mirea, Nichifor, Pantazi, S\u0103vinoiu, \u0218oimaru, Urzic\u0103, Buliga, Oprea, Breniuc, Apachi\u021bei and Vr\u00e2nceanu; the administrative leadership was ensured by: Gheorghe \u0218tefan, Gh.Chivorchian, Iulian \u021aocu, Liviu Tudor, Ioan Str\u0103til\u0103 and Luigi Bodo.\nThe club was named for 6 months in 1993 as \"Ceahl\u0103ul Simpex\", due to sponsorship reason.\nFollowing these 30 years of Divizia B, along with the names already mentioned, important contributions have been related to the names of the following people: I.Iovicin, M.Cre\u021bu, Radu Toma, V.Rizea, Tr.Coman, N.Zaharia, T.Anghelini, Toader \u0218te\u021b, M.Nedelcu, M.Radu and Fl.Hizo (coaches); C.Acatinc\u0103i, Gh.Ocneanu, D.Lospa and M.Contardo (presidents).\nGolden Age of Ceahl\u0103ul (1993\u20132004).\nThe golden age of Ceahl\u0103ul was a period full of successes, beaten records, but also full of controversies, accusations and strange moments.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1993\u201394 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; Ceahl\u0103ul was a well-known second league team, but a novice and a mysterious team for most combatants in the first division of the country. With the former player, Mircea Nedelcu, as the new coach and with its first golden generation on the pitch, Ceahl\u0103ul made a more than decent first season, installing where it felt the best also in the second league, on the 10th place, in the middle of the table. In the same component Ceahl\u0103ul would exceed all expectations and get the best performance in the history of the club, until then, a 5th place at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt; season and the first qualifying in a European Cup.\n&lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt; season is an important landmark in the history of the club from &lt;a href=\"Neam%C8%9B%20County\"&gt;Neam\u021b County&lt;/a&gt;, the club playing for the first time in a European Competitions, more exactly in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where they have had remarkable results, winning a group composed of: &lt;a href=\"FC%20Groningen\"&gt;FC Groningen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K.S.K.%20Beveren\"&gt;Beveren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Zbrojovka%20Brno\"&gt;Boby Brno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Etar%20%28Veliko%20Tarnovo%29\"&gt;Etar Veliko Tarnovo&lt;/a&gt;. The results were as follows: 2\u20130 against Etar, 2\u20130 against Beveren, 2\u20130 against Brno and 0\u20130 against Groningen. In the round of 16 \"nem\u021benii\" encountered &lt;a href=\"FC%20Metz\"&gt;FC Metz&lt;/a&gt; of France, in front of which they inclined at Piatra Neam\u021b, 0\u20132, goals scored by &lt;a href=\"Jocelyn%20Blanchard\"&gt;Jocelyn Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franck%20Meyrignac\"&gt;Franck Meyrignac&lt;/a&gt;. In the championship the team did not feel so good, probably accusing their first participation in European competitions and finished 15th, at 6 points from the relegation zone.\nUnder coach &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Marin\"&gt;Florin Marin&lt;/a&gt;, \"the Yellow and Blacks\" had a revival in the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1996\u201397&lt;/a&gt; season and end on the 6th place at only one point distance of the best performance equalizing. Followed two consecutive rankings in the 9th place, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1997\u201398&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1998\u201399&lt;/a&gt; seasons, the team being trained by: &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Marin\"&gt;Florin Marin&lt;/a&gt;, Mircea Nedelcu, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Manea\"&gt;Nicolae Manea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Hizo\"&gt;Viorel Hizo&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999 Ceahl\u0103ul was preparing for a new European Cup participation, the same UEFA Intertoto Cup, but the &lt;a href=\"1999%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;1999 season&lt;/a&gt;. Ceahl\u0103ul made a new good run and eliminated two teams: &lt;a href=\"FK%20Ekranas\"&gt;Ekranas&lt;/a&gt; (2\u20130 on aggregate) and &lt;a href=\"NK%20Jedinstvo%20Biha%C4%87\"&gt;Jedinstvo Biha\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (5\u20132 on aggregate). In the third round Ceahl\u0103ul would have had a historical two matches encounter, the games for which the entire Moldavia mobilized its forces, against the titrated &lt;a href=\"Italia\"&gt;Italia&lt;/a&gt;n side &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;. This double would remain an important landmark in the history of the club, the more so as Ceahl\u0103ul gave a good \"answer\", 1\u20131 at Piatra Neam\u021b, scored Sc\u00e2nteie in the 28th minute and &lt;a href=\"Alessio%20Tacchinardi\"&gt;Alessio Tacchinardi&lt;/a&gt; in the 58th. In Italy, on the &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Dino%20Manuzzi\"&gt;Dino Manuzzi Stadium&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cesena\"&gt;Cesena&lt;/a&gt;, they obtained an unexpected 0\u20130, but not enough to qualify. In the Divizia A Ceahl\u0103ul finished on the 4th place, best performance in its entire history, &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1999\u20132000&lt;/a&gt; season, being in fact the top period of the club. This golden generation, the second after the 1993 one, had &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Hizo\"&gt;Viorel Hizo&lt;/a&gt; as a coach and the following players: &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Anghel\"&gt;Eugen Anghel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costel%20C%C3%A2mpeanu\"&gt;Costel C\u00e2mpeanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Lefter\"&gt;Radu Lefter&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Alistar\"&gt;Angelo Alistar&lt;/a&gt;, Cristinel Atomulesei, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Baldovin\"&gt;Adrian Baldovin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumitru%20Botez\"&gt;Dumitru Botez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Codru%C8%9B%20Dom%C8%99a\"&gt;Codru\u021b Dom\u0219a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costel%20Enache\"&gt;Costel Enache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leontin%20Grozavu\"&gt;Leontin Grozavu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Ilie\"&gt;Constantin Ilie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Dan%20Ionescu\"&gt;Mihai Dan Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ovidiu%20Marc\"&gt;Ovidiu Marc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Nem%C8%9Banu\"&gt;Mihai Nem\u021banu&lt;/a&gt;, Gheorghe Pantazi, &lt;a href=\"D%C4%83nu%C8%9B%20Perj%C4%83\"&gt;D\u0103nu\u021b Perj\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Sc\u00e2nteie, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Solomon\"&gt;Adrian Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiberiu%20%C8%98erban\"&gt;Tiberiu \u0218erban&lt;/a&gt;, Tudorel \u0218oimaru and &lt;a href=\"Lavi%20Hrib\"&gt;Lavi Hrib&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000 Ceahl\u0103ul entered again in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a traditional team of this competition. After a 9\u20134 on aggregate against &lt;a href=\"JK%20Narva%20Trans\"&gt;Narva Trans&lt;/a&gt; from Estonia, in the first round, followed a 4\u20133 against &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Mallorca\"&gt;Mallorca&lt;/a&gt; from Spain and Ceahlaul impressed again. In the third round \"nem\u021benii\" faced &lt;a href=\"FK%20Austria%20Wien\"&gt;Austria Wien&lt;/a&gt; and after a 2\u20132 in Piatra Neam\u021b, \"the Yellow and Blacks\" succumbed at &lt;a href=\"Wien\"&gt;Wien&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Horr%20Stadium\"&gt;Franz Horr Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, 0\u20133, goals scored by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Wagner%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201975%29\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, Leitner and &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Dospel\"&gt;Dospel&lt;/a&gt;.\nA proverb says: \"What got up has to go down\" and that's exactly what happened to Ceahl\u0103ul in the early 2000s. Frequent changes of coaches (11 in 4 years) from: Mircea Nedelcu to &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Halagian\"&gt;Florin Halagian&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Marin\"&gt;Florin Marin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Barbu\"&gt;Marin Barbu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Hizo\"&gt;Viorel Hizo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marius%20L%C4%83c%C4%83tu%C8%99\"&gt;Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219&lt;/a&gt; and the partial change of generations led to poor results: &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 11th, &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 8th, &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2003\u201304&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 14th. Ceahl\u0103ul relegated in 2004 after 11 years and 10 seasons in the first league, with &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Hizo\"&gt;Viorel Hizo&lt;/a&gt; in the first part and &lt;a href=\"Marius%20L%C4%83c%C4%83tu%C8%99\"&gt;Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219&lt;/a&gt; in the second part at the team's lead. But just before this disastrous season had a rage of pride and finished on the 5th place at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt; and signing up for a new participation in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This time the results were far away from the 1995, 1999 and 2000 campaigns, the team being eliminated from the first round by &lt;a href=\"Tampere%20United\"&gt;Tampere United&lt;/a&gt; of Finland.\nDespite its notable performances Ceahl\u0103ul was also a very controversial team during this period, especially due to his president, Gheorghe \u0218tefan, the person who binds the highest performances of the football from Piatra Neam\u021b. \u0218tefan, who is nicknamed \"Pinalti\", because he always demanded a penalty (with &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20dialect\"&gt;Moldavian&lt;/a&gt; accent) and always had to comment on the referee's evolution, had also been repeatedly accused of being together with Jean \"Tata Jean\" P\u0103dureanu (Gloria Bistri\u021ba president) the father of the \"Football Cooperative\", a group of teams known for match fixing in the 1990s. Along with Ceahl\u0103ul were involved teams such as: &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Gloria%20Bistri%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Gloria Bistri\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SR%20Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;FC Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that nothing has ever been officially investigated, statements of players, coaches, or even presidents testify for the strange matches from that period, as well as on-the-spot reports. The so-called \"reciprocities\" consisted in the fact that teams deliberately offered points between themselves to help with various purposes: winning the championship, qualifying in the European Cups or avoiding relegation. The enormous pressure put on the referees, match by match, brought to the city and Ceahl\u0103ul the nickname of \"Kosovo\", a war zone in the 1990s. Another memorable episode in the \"\u0218tefan's era\" at Piatra Neam\u021b was in 2000 before the first match from the third round of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;, against &lt;a href=\"FK%20Austria%20Wien\"&gt;Austria Wien&lt;/a&gt;, when he tried to offer prostitutes to the match referees, the club being suspended for a year from &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA Competitions&lt;/a&gt;. \"Pinalti\" would defend himself by stating that the girls were just members of a folk ensemble. First signs of the \"Football Cooperative\" have been noticed since 1993 when it was suspected that Ceahl\u0103ul offered suitcases with money for the teams in the first series to pull hard against opponents or to let it easier in direct matches with them. Gelu Cr\u0103can\u0103, one of the most passionate supporters of the team and a man who always found in its entourage stated in 2016: \"Mergeam cu gen\u0163i cu bani \u00een majoritatea deplas\u0103rilor. Am mai c\u0103rat \u015fi eu gen\u0163ile, \u0163in minte c\u0103 am purtat banii la mine c\u00e2nd am mers la Autobuzul Bucure\u0219ti\" (\"We went with money bags in most of the trips. I've also carried these bags, I remember that I took the money with me when we went to &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Rocar%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Autobuzul Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;.\"). Also Iulian \u021aocu, one of the directors of the club in that period made some important revelations about how, many matches had been fixed in that season.\nABBA period (2004\u20132016).\nIn this period the team was known as an \"ABBA team\" (a nickname used in Romania for clubs that used to alternate the presences between the first and the second league).\nAfter the relegation &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Marin\"&gt;Florin Marin&lt;/a&gt; was hired as the new coach and despite the fact that the squad has kept a large part of the players Ceahl\u0103ul finished only on the 5th place, far away from the expectations considered at the beginning of the season. 18 points away from the promotion place, occupied by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Vaslui\"&gt;FC Vaslui&lt;/a&gt; and 22 from the first relegation place, occupied by FC Ghimbav. &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Barbu\"&gt;Marin Barbu&lt;/a&gt; replaced Florin Marin for the next season and the team below Pietricica Mountain promoted without major problems, 7 points over the second place, occupied by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Forex%20Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Forex Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt; and 8 points over &lt;a href=\"SR%20Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;FC Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this period the club changed its logo, the old one with the black goat and the &lt;a href=\"Ceahl%C4%83u%20Massif\"&gt;Ceahl\u0103u Massif&lt;/a&gt; on the background being replaced by the one with a bear, also the orange color, used as well in the past, became the first color, the traditional yellow and black kits is now used only in the away matches. Also in this period, the team has been nicknamed as \"Ur\u0219ii carpatini\" (\"The Carpathian Bears\").\n&lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2006\u201307 Liga I&lt;/a&gt; season found a team far away from the form displayed in the late 1990s first league matches, with many managerial changes and with lack of inspiration Ceahl\u0103ul finished 15th, out of 18, and relegated after only one season spent in the top flight. But an unexpected help appeared in the summer of 2007, when &lt;a href=\"FC%20Delta%20Dobrogea%20Tulcea\"&gt;Delta Tulcea&lt;/a&gt;, 2nd place in the first series of &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt; could not obtain the license for the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2007\u201308 Liga I&lt;/a&gt; season, the team from &lt;a href=\"Piatra%20Neam%C8%9B\"&gt;Piatra Neam\u021b&lt;/a&gt; being accepted in its place. But it was a short-lived joy, under &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Hizo\"&gt;Viorel Hizo&lt;/a&gt;, the coach who obtained the best performances in the club's history, Ceahl\u0103ul relegated once again, after finishing on the same 15th place with 36 points, one less than &lt;a href=\"SCM%20Gloria%20Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Gloria Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;, last team saved.\nWith Florin Marin, once again at the helm of the team, and with a new generation which included players like: &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Vi%C8%9Belaru\"&gt;Andrei Vi\u021belaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Forminte\"&gt;Alexandru Forminte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Ichim\"&gt;Alexandru Ichim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Barna\"&gt;Daniel Barna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20%C8%9Aepe%C8%99\"&gt;Andrei \u021aepe\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Achim\"&gt;Vlad Achim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eugeniu%20Cebotaru\"&gt;Eugeniu Cebotaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Achim\"&gt;Vlad Achim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ionu%C8%9B%20B%C4%83descu\"&gt;Ionu\u021b B\u0103descu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cristinel%20Gafi%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Cristinel Gafi\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, among others, Ceahl\u0103ul made an almost perfect season and promoted back to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Liga I&lt;/a&gt; with 69 points, result of 22 victories, 3 draws and 5 defeats, 52 goals scored and 17 conceded. The second place &lt;a href=\"FC%20Astra%20Giurgiu\"&gt;CSM Ploie\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; was at 2 points behind, but also promoted, the first place that doesn't promote was the 3rd one, occupied by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Delta%20Dobrogea%20Tulcea\"&gt;Delta Tulcea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe good evolutions from the second division did not materialize in the first division and \"the Carpathian Bears\" relegated once again, for the third time in the last 6 years, finishing 17th out of 18, with only 28 points obtained in 34 matches. During this season were also a lot of changes in the technical staff. The club started the season with &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Marin\"&gt;Florin Marin&lt;/a&gt;, continued with &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Mul%C8%9Bescu\"&gt;Gheorghe Mul\u021bescu&lt;/a&gt; and ended with ex-&lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Zoran%20Filipovi%C4%87\"&gt;Zoran Filipovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a strong route, Ceahl\u0103ul promoted once again at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Liga%20II\"&gt;2010\u201311 Liga II&lt;/a&gt; season, this time with &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Barbu\"&gt;Marin Barbu&lt;/a&gt; as a coach, at the second promotion with the team from Piatra Neam\u021b, after the 2006 one. In the squad appeared names as &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Dumitra%C8%99\"&gt;Andrei Dumitra\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Marc\"&gt;Andrei Marc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Chito%C8%99c%C4%83\"&gt;Sebastian Chito\u0219c\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, the difference from the 2nd place (&lt;a href=\"CS%20Concordia%20Chiajna\"&gt;Concordia Chiajna&lt;/a&gt;) and the 3rd place (&lt;a href=\"AFC%20S%C4%83geata%20N%C4%83vodari\"&gt;S\u0103geata N\u0103vodari&lt;/a&gt;) being of 6 respectively 9 points.\nDue to the good financial situation, the excellent training conditions and a talented generation of players completed with some experienced ones, but also due to the contribution of a new wave of talented coaches such as: &lt;a href=\"Costel%20Enache\"&gt;Costel Enache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Miriu%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Vasile Miriu\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Ilie\"&gt;Constantin Ilie&lt;/a&gt;, Ceahl\u0103ul maintained for four consecutive years in the first league, with the following results: &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 11th, &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2012\u201313&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 14th, &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 9th and &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 18th.\nThe big problems started for Ceahl\u0103ul in 2014 when the club began to be suffocated by the historical debts. In the same year \u0218tefan, who was also the mayor of &lt;a href=\"Piatra%20Neam%C8%9B\"&gt;Piatra Neam\u021b&lt;/a&gt; between 2004 and 2014 has begun to have legal problems, being even arrested in the \"Microsoft Case\". Without municipality's help or involvement of \"Pinalti\" Ceahl\u0103ul has been seen in a situation without exit, in December 2014 55% of the club's shares were sold to the Italian businessman Angelo Massone. Massone has brought many players from the Italian or Spanish lower leagues and hired coaches such as: &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%A9%20Maria%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201973%29\"&gt;Z\u00e9 Maria&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vanja%20Radinovi%C4%87\"&gt;Vanja Radinovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, but with no effect for \"the Carpathian Bears\".\nReturned to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;, without money from TV rights, without the help of the municipality and with an owner who did not seem to invest anything in the team, with the conditions being really bad, so bad that the media even called the club as: \"Massone's Camp\". With a drifting financial situation, unpaid players, six coaches changed in a season and the same policy of transfers from the Italian and Spanish lower leagues Ceahl\u0103ul ended the regular season only on the 12th place avoiding the direct relegation in the last minute. However Ceahl\u0103ul withdrew from the championship with a few rounds before the end of the play-out round and was relegated to the county leagues.\nThe financial problems could not be managed and the club entered in dissolution in the spring of 2016.\nA new beginning (2016\u2013present).\nOn 22 July 2016 was announced in the media that the club will be re-founded as CSM Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b, the founders of the new entity being: Mihai B\u0103tr\u00e2nu and C\u0103t\u0103lin Roca, owners of Moldocor and Ro Com Central Companies, two old sponsors of the team. Also RIFIL Company, a traditional sponsor of the team, represented by Luigi Bodo and Ioan Str\u0103til\u0103 have shown their support for the new entity. On 17 August 2016 the new entity has acquired legal personality.\nThe logo of the club was also changed, the black goat and &lt;a href=\"Ceahl%C4%83u%20Massif\"&gt;Ceahl\u0103u Massif&lt;/a&gt; returning to the foreground, in a restyled form, also the club colors were changed to the original ones, yellow and black. The team was enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20V\"&gt;Liga V&lt;/a&gt; and the experienced Toader \u0218te\u021b was hired as the new coach. The squad was formed from players who grew up at Ceahl\u0103ul Football Academy and after only one season the team below Pietricica Mountain promoted to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20IV\"&gt;Liga IV&lt;/a&gt;, having a destructive ranking: 1st place, 16 victories, 0 draws, 0 defeats, 136 goals scored and only 5 conceded, 48 points, with 13 more than the 2nd place (Olimpia Grin\u021bie\u0219).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Liga%20IV\"&gt;2017\u201318 Liga IV&lt;/a&gt; season, \"nem\u021benii\" started with the same Toader \u0218te\u021b as a coach and with players that also played for the team in the second league, or even in the first league, such as: Teodor C\u00eempianu, Alexandru Sm\u0103u, &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Rusu\"&gt;Marius Rusu&lt;/a&gt;, Andrei Apostol, Cristian Copo\u021b-Barb or Andrei Mateiciuc, among others. As expected, the team did not face too many problems and entered in the winter break from the 1st place, with victories on the line. During the winter break Toader \u0218te\u021b was replaced by Gabriel R\u0103dulescu.\nYouth program.\nYouth academy of Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b is the biggest and most successful in &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, over time from this academy going into big football players such as: &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Av%C4%83danei\"&gt;Vasile Av\u0103danei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Axinia\"&gt;Florin Axinia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Bordeianu\"&gt;Mihai Bordeianu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Burdujan\"&gt;Lucian Burdujan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20C%C4%83ru%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Robert C\u0103ru\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, Gelu Chertic, Lidi Chertic &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Chito%C8%99c%C4%83\"&gt;Sebastian Chito\u0219c\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Covrig\"&gt;Lucian Covrig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Dr%C4%83ghiceanu\"&gt;Marian Dr\u0103ghiceanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costel%20Enache\"&gt;Costel Enache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Forminte\"&gt;Alexandru Forminte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Ichim\"&gt;Alexandru Ichim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Ilie\"&gt;Constantin Ilie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Dan%20Ionescu\"&gt;Mihai Dan Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Marc\"&gt;Andrei Marc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Nohai\"&gt;Florin Nohai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doru%20Popadiuc\"&gt;Doru Popadiuc&lt;/a&gt;, Gabriel R\u0103dulescu, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Solomon\"&gt;Adrian Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, Tudor \u0218oimaru, &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20%C8%9Aepe%C8%99\"&gt;Andrei \u021aepe\u0219&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Vi%C8%9Belaru\"&gt;Andrei Vi\u021belaru&lt;/a&gt;.

Originally known as \"Borzoghean\" and still nicknamed in this mode by the supporters, the stadium had a capacity of 12,000 seats and the shape of letter \"U\". Between 2006 and 2007 the stadium was renovated, extended (a new End Sector was built), orange seats were mounted instead of the old yellow and black ones and a floodlight installation was also installed. The capacity reached 18,000 seats after other renovations which took place in the early 2010s.
