    "text": "Amar Shahid Bandhu Singh Shrinet was a &lt;a href=\"guerrilla\"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; who fought against the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; in India.\nBandhu Singh was born on 1 May 1833 in a Shrinet Rajput(&lt;a href=\"Rajput\"&gt;Rajput&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Zamindar\"&gt;Zamindar&lt;/a&gt; family of Babu Shiv Prasad Singh of Dumari Riyasat. He had five brothers named Dal Hamman Singh, Tejai Singh, Fateh Singh, Jheenak Singh and Karia Singh. He was a devotee of Tarkulaha Devi. He was finally arrested by the British along with Shivgobind Chand of Chillupar,Gorakhpur. He was hanged publicly at Ali Nagar Chauraha in &lt;a href=\"Gorakhpur\"&gt;Gorakhpur&lt;/a&gt; on 12 August 1858 but luckily Shivgobind Chand escaped to Nepal to his daughter Samrajya Laxmi Devi of Nepal. There is a month-long &lt;a href=\"Mela\"&gt;Mela&lt;/a&gt; (funfair) every year starting from Chaitra &lt;a href=\"Ramnavami\"&gt;Ramnavami&lt;/a&gt; at the Tarkulaha Devi Temple. People from far-flung locations visit \nAmar Shahid was a freedom fighter \u2018Tarkulaha Mela\u2019 to shop for their annual requirements of Garam Masala (Indian Spices) and to enjoy the traditional \u2018&lt;a href=\"Nautanki\"&gt;Nautanki&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 (drama), Nag Kanya shows and small circuses. Also, Tarkulaha Devi Temple was Shaheed Bandhu Singh's favourite place."
