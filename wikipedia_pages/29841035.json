    "text": "The 16-inch coastal defense gun M1895 was a large &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; piece installed to defend major American &lt;a href=\"seaport\"&gt;seaport&lt;/a&gt;s. Only one was built and it was installed in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Grant\"&gt;Fort Grant&lt;/a&gt; on the Pacific side of the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Zone\"&gt;Panama Canal Zone&lt;/a&gt;. It was operated by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps\"&gt;United States Army Coast Artillery Corps&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nUnder President &lt;a href=\"Grover%20Cleveland\"&gt;Grover Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;'s administration in 1885, the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Fortifications\"&gt;Board of Fortifications&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"William%20Crowninshield%20Endicott\"&gt;William C. Endicott&lt;/a&gt; was ordered to investigate the value and state of the United States' coastal defenses. Endicott found that America had fallen behind and that new naval technology made many forts and coastal defense weaponry obsolete. The 1886 report recommended a $127-million ($ in ) construction program of breech-loading cannons, mortars, floating batteries, and submarine mines for some 29 locations on the US coastline. New fortifications built in the following decades as a result of this report were called \"Endicott Period\" fortifications.\nFinding a need for long range weaponry, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps\"&gt;United States Army Coast Artillery Corps&lt;/a&gt; ordered a 16-inch (406\u00a0mm) gun, the construction of which began in 1895 at the &lt;a href=\"Watervliet%20Arsenal\"&gt;Watervliet Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Watervliet%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Watervliet, New York&lt;/a&gt;. The massive artillery piece was designated the M1895 and was completed in 1902; only one was built. At it weighed more than any gun that had ever been created up to that point. The 32-wheel train car alone weighed . The long gun could launch a shell .\nThe weapon was shipped from the Watervliet Arsenal to &lt;a href=\"Watertown%20Arsenal\"&gt;Watertown Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Watertown%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Watertown, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; to be packed for shipment to the Panama Canal Zone. It was installed on an M1912 &lt;a href=\"Disappearing%20gun\"&gt;disappearing carriage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Grant\"&gt;Fort Grant&lt;/a&gt; on the Pacific side of the canal in 1915, where it protected the fort until it was scrapped in 1943. The muzzle section was later preserved and displayed at the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Building%20%28Watervliet%20Arsenal%29\"&gt;Watervliet Arsenal museum&lt;/a&gt;, which closed in 2013.\nBibliography.\nNotes\nReferences "
