    "text": "Incarceration is one of the &lt;a href=\"punishment\"&gt;criminal punishments&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; provided for in the &lt;a href=\"Criminal%20Code%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;Criminal Code of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse of punishment.\n&lt;a href=\"Incarceration\"&gt;Incarceration&lt;/a&gt; is provided for by &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; for most &lt;a href=\"crime\"&gt;criminal offenses&lt;/a&gt; as a required and/or discretionary punishment. Any person, regardless of status, age, sex, or other category, may be imprisoned.\nA sentence of incarceration may be for between 1 and 15 years. If two or more offenses or consecutive &lt;a href=\"Sentence%20%28law%29\"&gt;sentences&lt;/a&gt; are handed down in one case, this period can be increased to 25 years. Depending on the maximum period of incarceration (along with certain amounts of &lt;a href=\"Fine%20%28penalty%29\"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt; after 17 January 2012), crimes may be classified as \"non-grave\" crimes (up to 5 years), grave crimes (up to 10 years), or special grave crimes (more than 10 years years, as well as sentences of &lt;a href=\"life%20imprisonment\"&gt;life imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;). Incarceration cannot be imposed for misdemeanors. Reduced terms of incarceration apply to &lt;a href=\"minor%20%28law%29\"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe term of &lt;a href=\"pre-trial%20detention\"&gt;pre-trial detention&lt;/a&gt; is 12 months for &lt;a href=\"felonies\"&gt;felonies&lt;/a&gt; and 6 months for &lt;a href=\"petty%20crime\"&gt;petty crime&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTypes of prison colonies.\nThere are three types of colonies: minimum security level, medium security level, and maximum security level. Minors serve sentences in educational colonies (). In these colonies, areas of quarantine, diagnostics and distribution, resocialization, and intensified supervision are organised. They differ as to living conditions. Depending on the behaviour of a convicted person, he can be moved from one type of colony to another."
