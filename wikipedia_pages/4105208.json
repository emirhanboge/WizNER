    "title": "1970 South African general election",
    "text": "General elections were held in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; on 22 April 1970 to elect members of the 166-seat &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Parliament was dissolved on 2 March and the deadline for the submission of candidates was 13 March. \nThe elections marked the first time since the formation of South African in 1910 that the House of Assembly would be responsible solely to &lt;a href=\"White%20South%20Africans\"&gt;White South Africans&lt;/a&gt;, as the seats for the four MPs elected separately by \"qualified\" &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Coloured\"&gt;Cape Coloured&lt;/a&gt; voters expired in the same year, completing the process of political &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;. They were also the first elections after the 1969 expulsion of &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Hertzog\"&gt;Albert Hertzog&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and many \"verkrampte\" (hardline) representatives from the ruling &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; (NP), who had subsequently formed the &lt;a href=\"Herstigte%20Nasionale%20Party\"&gt;Herstigte Nasionale Party&lt;/a&gt; (HNP). This realignment marked a new chapter in the political divisions of the country, with the hardline Afrikaner right-wing later forming the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s. \nThe elections resulted in the NP retained its large majority, reaffirming it as the dominant party for the post-Verwoerd era. Several new representatives were elected, including &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Heunis\"&gt;Chris Heunis&lt;/a&gt;, future Acting President and candidate for the NP leadership, and &lt;a href=\"Pik%20Botha\"&gt;Pik Botha&lt;/a&gt;, future &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs\"&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (1977\u20131994). However, the NP lost seats for the first time since the &lt;a href=\"1948%20South%20African%20general%20election\"&gt;1948 election&lt;/a&gt;, seeing its representation reduced by eight seats. With Hertzog's HNP failing to win a seat, the split in the nationalist vote benefitted the moderate &lt;a href=\"United%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;United Party&lt;/a&gt; (UP) in several constituencies, invigorating it for perhaps the last time. &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Suzman\"&gt;Helen Suzman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"member%20of%20parliament\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Houghton%20Estate%2C%20Gauteng\"&gt;Houghton&lt;/a&gt;, retained her seat as the sole representative of the &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, the last parliament for which she would sit for her caucus alone.\nResults.\nEleven members were elected unopposed. Voting in one constituency did not take place, with the National Party winning the subsequent by-election to give it a total of 118 seats.\nAftermath.\nPik Botha made his &lt;a href=\"maiden%20speech\"&gt;maiden speech&lt;/a&gt; in an unusual tone for an NP deputy, demanding that the government sign the &lt;a href=\"UN%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;UN Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"F.%20W.%20de%20Klerk\"&gt;F. W. de Klerk&lt;/a&gt; was eventually elected to this parliament in a by-election to the seat for &lt;a href=\"Vereeniging\"&gt;Vereeniging&lt;/a&gt; in September 1972, replacing NP member V P Coetzee."
