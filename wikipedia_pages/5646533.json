    "text": "The Bij 't Vuur was a Dutch &lt;a href=\"automobile\"&gt;automobile&lt;/a&gt; manufactured by C. Bij 't Vuur in &lt;a href=\"Arnhem\"&gt;Arnhem&lt;/a&gt; from 1902 until 1906. The name means something like \"Near to the fire\".\nThe company started out as a &lt;a href=\"coachbuilder\"&gt;coachbuilder&lt;/a&gt;, when in 1901 it made her first car. The first cars had &lt;a href=\"Aster%20%28auto%20parts%20company%29\"&gt;Aster&lt;/a&gt; engines but later ones used &lt;a href=\"De%20Dion-Bouton\"&gt;De Dion-Bouton&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Panhard\"&gt;Panhard&lt;/a&gt; units. With the car Bij 't Vuur took part in the \"Toer door Nederland\" (Tour of Holland, one of the first initiatives in the Netherlands to promote cars), after which it was sold.\nThe next project was a car with a bit heavier engine. In 1902 a 9\u00a0hp and a 12\u00a0hp-version were offered, which had a quite modern cardan axle with three gears forward and one backwards.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"AutoRAI\"&gt;RAI Motor Show&lt;/a&gt; of 1905 Bij 't Vuur showed a car with a self-built engine. This marked the end of Bij 't Vuur as car manufacturer. From then on, it only made buses.\nAbout 25 cars were produced."
