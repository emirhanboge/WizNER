    "text": "Morgan Lloyd Stoddart (born 23 September 1984) is a former &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player. His usual position was &lt;a href=\"Fullback%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt; or wing.\nIn January 2013, Stoddart retired from rugby due to injury.\nHis brother &lt;a href=\"Hywel%20Stoddart\"&gt;Hywel Stoddart&lt;/a&gt; is also a professional rugby union player.\nCareer.\nTreorchy RFC.\nStoddart began his rugby career at &lt;a href=\"Treorchy%20RFC\"&gt;Treorchy RFC&lt;/a&gt;, working his way through the club's youth ranks before finally making it into the senior team for the 2003\u201304 season while still only 18 years old. Stoddart made most of his appearances at &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%2310.%20Fly-half\"&gt;fly-half&lt;/a&gt; that season, scoring over 250 points for the Rhondda club. However, Treorchy were relegated from the First Division and Stoddart was given a trial at &lt;a href=\"Pontypridd%20RFC\"&gt;Pontypridd RFC&lt;/a&gt;.\nPontypridd RFC.\nUnlike the previous season, Pontypridd deployed Stoddart at fullback for most of his appearances in the 2004\u201305 season, and gradually earned a reputation as one of the most attacking prospects in the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, Stoddart made the number 15 shirt at &lt;a href=\"Sardis%20Road\"&gt;Sardis Road&lt;/a&gt; his own, and his explosive breaks were said to have provided the catalyst for Ponty's 2006 &lt;a href=\"WRU%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Konica Minolta Cup&lt;/a&gt; triumph over &lt;a href=\"Neath%20RFC\"&gt;Neath&lt;/a&gt;.\nScarlets.\nStoddart's performances did not go unnoticed by the Welsh regional sides, and he eventually signed a professional contract with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Llanelli Scarlets&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. Throughout the 2006\u201307 season, Stoddart played as understudy to Wales international &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Davies%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Barry Davies&lt;/a&gt;, playing most of his matches for &lt;a href=\"Llanelli%20RFC\"&gt;Llanelli RFC&lt;/a&gt;, but he eventually made his breakthrough to the regional side in the latter half of the season, making nine appearances, including two in the Heineken Cup.\nHe also scored two tries, including a 25-yard effort against Ulster in the Heineken Cup. Stoddart's efforts were rewarded when he won the Principality Premiership Player of the Year award for his contribution during the 2006/07 season for Llanelli.\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, Stoddart was given the chance to play at fullback regularly, following the departure of Barry Davies to Brive. Stoddart put in excellent performances which would lead to an international call up to the &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Welsh national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nWales.\nOn 14 November 2007, Stoddart was given his first call-up to the &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20William%20Cup\"&gt;Prince William Cup&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and on 20 November, it was announced that he would be given the number 15 shirt as Wales' starting fullback. Although Wales lost 12\u201334, Stoddart shone on his debut, setting up Wales' first try and scoring the second. In January 2011 he was recalled to the Wales squad for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2011 Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;, a tournament in which he scored two tries in three appearances, one in the opener against England and the other against Italy.\nOn 6 August 2011 during a World Cup warm up match between Wales and &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, Stoddart broke his left leg after being tackled by &lt;a href=\"Delon%20Armitage\"&gt;Delon Armitage&lt;/a&gt;. The incident was so graphic that match broadcaster &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Sports\"&gt;Sky Sports&lt;/a&gt; chose not to show a replay. The injury ended any hopes Stoddart had of playing in that year's &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;."
