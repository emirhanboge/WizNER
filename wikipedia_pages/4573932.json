    "text": "Surakul Stadium (; ) is a &lt;a href=\"multi-purpose%20stadium\"&gt;multi-purpose stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Phuket%20Province\"&gt;Phuket Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently used mostly for &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches. The stadium holds 15,000 and was built in 1959.\nThe stadium co-hosted the &lt;a href=\"2008%20AFF%20Suzuki%20Cup\"&gt;2008 AFF Suzuki Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The use of the Surakul Stadium for this tournament had to be hastily arranged. Stadiums in &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; were intended to be used but because of the airport takeovers in Bangkok by the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Alliance%20for%20Democracy\"&gt;PAD&lt;/a&gt; the AFF in consultation with the FAT decided to switch venues. Despite better stadiums being available in &lt;a href=\"Nakhon%20Ratchasima\"&gt;Nakhon Ratchasima&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"5th%20December%20Stadium\"&gt;5th December Stadium&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Mai\"&gt;Chiang Mai&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"700th%20Anniversary%20Stadium\"&gt;700th Anniversary Stadium&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Songkhla\"&gt;Songkhla&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tinsulanon%20Stadium\"&gt;Tinsulanon Stadium&lt;/a&gt;); the Surakul Stadium was chosen as all the teams could fly directly into Phuket.\nThe stadium also played host to the &lt;a href=\"2009%20King%27s%20Cup\"&gt;2009 King's Cup&lt;/a&gt; which included a notorious game involving Thailand and Lebanon where the latter walked off the pitch during the game as they became incensed by what they saw as biased refereeing.\nThe stadium will be used by &lt;a href=\"Phuket%20F.C.\"&gt;Phuket F.C.&lt;/a&gt; for the 2009 season in the newly formed Division 2 Southern Region of the &lt;a href=\"Thailand%20Division%202%20League\"&gt;Thailand Division 2 League&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe finals of the well-known &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20tens\"&gt;Rugby tens&lt;/a&gt;, Phuket International Rugby 10's in June 2009 are also played there."
