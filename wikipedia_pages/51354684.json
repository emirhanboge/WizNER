    "text": "The Hughes 393 (sometimes referred to as the HS-393) is a &lt;a href=\"communications%20satellite\"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"satellite%20bus\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; introduced in 1985 by &lt;a href=\"Hughes%20Space%20and%20Communications%20Company\"&gt;Hughes Space and Communications Company&lt;/a&gt;. It was a &lt;a href=\"Spin-stabilized%20satellite\"&gt;spin-stabilized&lt;/a&gt; bus that had twice as much power as the &lt;a href=\"HS-376\"&gt;HS-376&lt;/a&gt; platform.\nDesign.\nThe satellite bus was designed and manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hughes%20Space%20and%20Communications%20Company\"&gt;Hughes&lt;/a&gt;. It had a launch mass of , a mass of after reaching &lt;a href=\"geostationary%20orbit\"&gt;geostationary orbit&lt;/a&gt;, and an 8-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were in height and in diameter. With its solar panels fully extended its height was .\nIts power system generated approximately 2,350\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Watt\"&gt;watts&lt;/a&gt; of power at &lt;a href=\"BOL%20%28engineering%29\"&gt;beginning of life&lt;/a&gt; and 2,200 at end of life, thanks to two cylindrical solar panels. These panels used K7 and K4-3/4 solar cells, with more than twice the number of cells than on the &lt;a href=\"HS-376\"&gt;HS-376&lt;/a&gt;. The bottom panel was retracted around the body and top panel for launch, and extended downwards for operation. It also had two 38 &lt;a href=\"ampere%20hour\"&gt;Ah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nickel%E2%80%93hydrogen%20battery\"&gt;NiH2 batteries&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts propulsion system was composed of two &lt;a href=\"R-4D\"&gt;R-4D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liquid%20Apogee%20Engine\"&gt;liquid apogee engines&lt;/a&gt; with a thrust of . It also had two axial and four radial &lt;a href=\"Bipropellant%20rocket\"&gt;bipropellant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrusters%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;thrusters&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20station-keeping\"&gt;station-keeping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"attitude%20dynamics%20and%20control\"&gt;attitude control&lt;/a&gt;. It included enough propellant for &lt;a href=\"Geostationary%20transfer%20orbit\"&gt;orbit circularization&lt;/a&gt; and 8 years of operation.\nIts payload was composed of a antenna that fed &lt;a href=\"Ku%20band\"&gt;Ku band&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transponder%20%28satellite%20communications%29\"&gt;transponders&lt;/a&gt;.\nSatellites.\nThe HS-393 was a more powerful platform than the &lt;a href=\"HS-376\"&gt;HS-376&lt;/a&gt;, being able to supply 2,200 kW of power versus the 1,400 kW of the HS-376HP. Only three were ever built."
