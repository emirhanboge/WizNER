    "text": "Robert Edison Fulton Jr. (April 15, 1909 \u2013 May 7, 2004) was an &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; inventor and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. He is known for having traveled around the world on a motorcycle, authored a book and made a film about his journey, and for several aviation-related inventions, among his 70 patents. Fulton was also a professional photographer.\nBiography.\nFulton was born in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, on April 15, 1909, and named after &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Edison\"&gt;Thomas Edison&lt;/a&gt;, who was a friend of his father, Robert Fulton Sr., a president of &lt;a href=\"Mack%20Trucks\"&gt;Mack Trucks&lt;/a&gt;. His maternal grandfather, Ezra Johnson Travis, ran &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; lines across the old west after the Civil War, and his uncle, Elgin Travis, who took them over from his father, eventually converted the stagecoach routes into bus lines, which became &lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20Lines\"&gt;Greyhound Bus Line&lt;/a&gt;. As a teenager, he was in the elite when he traveled by commercial aircraft from &lt;a href=\"Miami%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, US to &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, in 1921, and then to &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Tutankhamun\"&gt;Tutankhamun&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb was opened in 1923. He attended middle school at Le Rosey in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Lausanne, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, for two years, then went to &lt;a href=\"Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy\"&gt;Exeter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Choate%20Rosemary%20Hall\"&gt;Choate&lt;/a&gt;, graduated with a degree in architecture from &lt;a href=\"Harvard\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; in 1931, and spent a further year of architectural study in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. At age 23, he traveled 25,000 miles (from &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; in 18 months) on a twin-cylinder &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20%28motorcycles%29\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle to study architecture around the world. Along the way, he shot 40,000 feet of film of his travels, over the 18-month period.\nUpon his return, he detailed his adventures in a book, \"One Man Caravan\", telling of being shot at in the &lt;a href=\"Khyber%20Pass\"&gt;Khyber Pass&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pashtun%20people\"&gt;Pathan&lt;/a&gt; (Pashtun) tribesmen, avoiding &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i bandits, spending a night in a &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; jail, and being a guest of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"raja\"&gt;raja&lt;/a&gt;hs. He went on a lecture tour of the United States, showing his film footage and telling of his journeys. In 1983, he produced, edited, and released, with his filmmaking sons, a 90-minute film compiled from his home movies, \"The One Man Caravan of Robert E. Fulton Jr. An Autofilmography\". Later in life, he revisited his motorcycle journey in another film program retelling of the epic trip, \"Twice Upon A Caravan.\"\nHe then went to work for &lt;a href=\"Pan%20American%20World%20Airways\"&gt;Pan American Airways&lt;/a&gt;, using his skills in cinematography to document the Pan American Clipper (flying boat) air routes from New York to South America and across the Pacific Ocean, just prior to World War II. He then formed a company to manufacture aeronautical equipment, Continental Inc.\nHe married for the first time in 1935, to Florence (Sally) Coburn (1912\u20131996) of Greenwich, Connecticut, with whom he had three sons\u00a0\u2014 Robert E., III (1939-2002), Travis (1943\u2013 ) of Snowmass Colorado, and Rawn (1946\u2013 ) of Bernardston, Massachusetts. Divorced in 1982, he later married Anne Boireau Smith of Nantes, France (1926\u20132002). He died at his home in &lt;a href=\"Newtown%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Newtown, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; on May 7, 2004.\nInventions.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Fulton invented the first ground-based aerial flight trainer, but when the military wasn't interested, he modified it into a training aid for aerial gunners, the first fixed aerial gunnery trainer, called the \"gunairstructor\".\nAfter the war, he designed and built an airplane that was convertible to be an automobile, called the \"&lt;a href=\"Fulton%20Airphibian\"&gt;Airphibian&lt;/a&gt;\", because of the time it took to travel to demonstrate the gunnery trainer. &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lindbergh\"&gt;Charles Lindbergh&lt;/a&gt; flew it 1950 and, although it was not a commercial success (financial costs of air worthiness certification forced him to relinquish control of the company, which never developed it further), it is now in the &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian\"&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1950s, after studying the way trains in &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; pick up mail bags by the side of the tracks, Fulton developed the &lt;a href=\"Fulton%20surface-to-air%20recovery%20system\"&gt;Fulton surface-to-air recovery system&lt;/a&gt;, also called the \"Skyhook\" for the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA), the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. It was a system that was used to pick up people from the ground with an aircraft. It was used by the United States Air Force until 1996. A sister invention for Navy frogmen was called \"Seasled\"."
