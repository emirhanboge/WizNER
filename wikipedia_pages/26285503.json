Her sister &lt;a href=\"Vita%20Semerenko\"&gt;Vita Semerenko&lt;/a&gt; later told in an interview that Valja cried four hours after she found out that she wouldn't participate in the relay. At evening before the competition Valja posted on &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; that \"we don't have any team\", \"our team is just ***\" and so on, and that she has something more to unveil about the team. Next day she said that she may finish her sport career immediately after the Games. Nevertheless she competed in World Cup after the Games.\nPersonal life.\nBiathlete &lt;a href=\"Vita%20Semerenko\"&gt;Vita&lt;/a&gt; is her twin sister. Valja is married to Oleksiy Prokhor.
