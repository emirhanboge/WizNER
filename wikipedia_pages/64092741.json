    "text": "Aruanda is a 1960 &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"documentary\"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"short%20film\"&gt;short film&lt;/a&gt; by Linduarte Noronha, about the remnants from a former &lt;a href=\"quilombo\"&gt;quilombo&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"sert%C3%A3o\"&gt;backlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Para%C3%ADba\"&gt;Para\u00edba State&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 2010s it was voted number 95 on the &lt;a href=\"Abraccine%20Top%20100%20Brazilian%20films\"&gt;Abraccine Top 100 Brazilian films list&lt;/a&gt; and also number 10 in the documentary list.\nPlot.\nThe film shows the daily miserable life of the inhabitants descendants of slavery from a former quilombo located in a semi-arid region of Para\u00edba State. Using some elements of fiction, the documentary approaches the local reality in an unusual way in the Brazilian cinema until then.\nProduction.\nThe project was inspired by a report by Linduarte Noronha, a &lt;a href=\"Pernambuco\"&gt;Pernambucano State&lt;/a&gt; born journalist based in Para\u00edba. He assembled a small film crew, composed of Vladimir Carvalho, Jo\u00e3o Ramiro Mello and Rucker Vieira. The production was also supported by the then National Institute of Educational Cinema, led by filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Humberto%20Mauro\"&gt;Humberto Mauro&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent disagreements over the script credits led to the breakup between Linduarte Nogueria with Vladimir Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o Ramiro Mello, the two presumably short film screenwriters (they were credited only as assistant directors).\nReception.\nConsidered the masterpiece of Linduarte Noronha, the film is also one of the precursors of the &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20Novo\"&gt;Cinema Novo&lt;/a&gt; movement."
