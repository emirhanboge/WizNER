    "text": "El Mundo (; ), before El Mundo del Siglo Veintiuno, is the second largest printed &lt;a href=\"daily%20newspaper\"&gt;daily newspaper&lt;/a&gt; in Spain. The paper is considered one of the country's &lt;a href=\"newspaper%20of%20record\"&gt;newspapers of record&lt;/a&gt; along with \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Pa%C3%ADs\"&gt;El Pa\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ABC%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nHistory and profile.\n\"El Mundo\" was first published on 23 October 1989. Perhaps the best known of its founders was &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20J.%20Ram%C3%ADrez\"&gt;Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez&lt;/a&gt;, who served as editor until 2014. Ramirez had risen to prominence as a journalist during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy\"&gt;Spanish transition to democracy&lt;/a&gt;. The other founders, &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20de%20Salas\"&gt;Alfonso de Salas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balbino%20Fraga\"&gt;Balbino Fraga&lt;/a&gt; and Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, shared with Ram\u00edrez a background in Grupo 16, the publishers of the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Diario%2016\"&gt;Diario 16&lt;/a&gt;\". Alfonso de Salas, Juan Gonzales and Gregorio Pena also launched \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Economista%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;El Economista&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2006.\n\"El Mundo\", along with \"&lt;a href=\"Marca%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Marca&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Expansi%C3%B3n%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Expansi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\", is controlled by the Italian publishing company &lt;a href=\"RCS%20MediaGroup\"&gt;RCS MediaGroup&lt;/a&gt; through its Spanish subsidiary company Unidad Editorial S.L. Its former owner was Unedisa which merged with Grupo Recoletos in 2007 to form Unidad Editorial, current owner of the paper.\nThe paper has its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, but maintains several news bureaus in other cities. The daily has a national edition and ten different regional editions, including those for &lt;a href=\"Andalusia\"&gt;Andalusia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valencia%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Castile and Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;. It is published in &lt;a href=\"tabloid%20format\"&gt;tabloid format&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005 \"El Mundo\" started a &lt;a href=\"Supplement%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for women, \"Yo Donna\", which was modelled on \"&lt;a href=\"IO%20Donna\"&gt;IO Donna&lt;/a&gt;\", a supplement of the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; daily \"&lt;a href=\"Corriere%20della%20Sera\"&gt;Corriere della Sera&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn January 2014 Pedro J. Ram\u00edrez, editor of the paper, was fired from his post. He argued that reporting on corruption scandals involving &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Prime%20Minister\"&gt;Spanish Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Rajoy\"&gt;Mariano Rajoy&lt;/a&gt; led to his sacking. Casimiro Garc\u00eda-Abadillo served as editor until April 2015, when he was replaced in turn by David Jim\u00e9nez.\nEditorial stance.\nEditorially, \"El Mundo\" often expresses the mainstream views of the &lt;a href=\"centre-right\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Nonpartisanism\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; overtones.\nEl Mundo defines its editorial line as &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;. It is usually critical of the &lt;a href=\"left-wing\"&gt;left-wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;peripheral nationalisms&lt;/a&gt;. Its current ideology is &lt;a href=\"secular\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"center-right%20politics\"&gt;center-right&lt;/a&gt;. Among its columnists there is a remarkable heterogeneity and eclecticism, often openly critical of the editorial line itself. At the time it was decisive in the fall of &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to its ideological principles, \n\u201cit aspires to be a &lt;a href=\"progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, committed to defending the current &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"civil%20liberties\"&gt;public freedoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; included in the Universal Declaration promulgated by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Convention%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;European Convention of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nPolitical impact.\n\"El Mundo\" has played a key role in uncovering a number of scandals, among them embezzlement by the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Guardia%20Civil%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Guardia Civil&lt;/a&gt;, accusations of &lt;a href=\"insider%20trading\"&gt;insider trading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fraud\"&gt;tax fraud&lt;/a&gt; by the governor of the &lt;a href=\"Banco%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Central Bank of Spain&lt;/a&gt; and aspects of the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A1rcenas%20affair\"&gt;B\u00e1rcenas affair&lt;/a&gt;. Investigative reporting by the staff of \"El Mundo\" also revealed connections between the terrorist &lt;a href=\"Grupos%20Antiterroristas%20de%20Liberaci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; (GAL) and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; administration of &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt;, revelations that contributed to his defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20legislative%20election%2C%201996\"&gt;1996 elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 2005, \"El Mundo\" revealed that Nazi &lt;a href=\"Aribert%20Heim\"&gt;Aribert Heim&lt;/a&gt; (aka \"Doctor Death\") had been living in Spain for 20 years, probably with help from the &lt;a href=\"ODESSA\"&gt;ODESSA&lt;/a&gt; network, in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Skorzeny\"&gt;Otto Skorzeny&lt;/a&gt;, who had helped set up one of the most important ODESSA bases of operation in Spain, during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"11%20March%202004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings\"&gt;11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings&lt;/a&gt;, the newspapers \"El Mundo\" and \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Raz%C3%B3n%20%28Madrid%29\"&gt;La Raz\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\", the regional television channel &lt;a href=\"Telemadrid\"&gt;Telemadrid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cadena%20COPE\"&gt;COPE&lt;/a&gt; radio network alleged that there had been inconsistencies in the explanations given by the Spanish judiciary about the bombings. Other Spanish media, such as \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Pa%C3%ADs\"&gt;El Pa\u00eds&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"ABC%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Cadena%20SER\"&gt;Cadena SER&lt;/a&gt; radio network, accused \"El Mundo\" and the other media of manipulation over this issue. The bombings and the results of the subsequent judicial inquiry are still debated in Spain today.\nCirculation.\nThe circulation of \"El Mundo\" rose in the 1990s. It was\nIn 2001 \"El Mundo\" had a circulation of 291,000 copies and it was 312,366 copies next year. The paper had a circulation of 300,000 copies in 2003, making it the third best selling newspaper in the country.\nBased on the findings of the European Business Readership Survey \"El Mundo\" had 11,591 readers per issue in 2006. Its circulation between June 2006 and July 2007 was 337,172 copies. The 2007 circulation of the paper was 337,000 copies. It was 338,286 copies in 2008 and had 200,000 readers for the printed edition in 2009. The circulation of the paper was 266,294 copies in 2011. In April 2020 the newspaper had 51,526 readers of the printed edition.\nDigital readership.\n\"El Mundo\" (elmundo.es) is currently the second &lt;a href=\"digital%20newspaper\"&gt;digital newspaper&lt;/a&gt; in Spanish. It was previously in the lead after \"El Pa\u00eds\" introduced a payment system for access to the contents of its electronic version. It had 24 million unique web visitors per month in 2009.\nMany online readers are in Latin America, and the website has an edition for the Americas. However, digital expansion has done little to offset the decline in revenues from Spanish advertisers since 2008.\nThe newspaper aims to increase digital profits via a subscription model. It launched a current affairs outlet only accessible to subscription customers, named ORBYT."
