    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"surface%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;surface&lt;/a&gt; \"S\" is ruled (also called a scroll) if through every point of \"S\" there is a straight line that lies on \"S\". Examples include the &lt;a href=\"plane%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;, the lateral surface of a &lt;a href=\"cylinder%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;cylinder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cone%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;cone&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"conical%20surface\"&gt;conical surface&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"ellipse\"&gt;elliptical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"directrix%20%28rational%20normal%20scroll%29\"&gt;directrix&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"right%20conoid\"&gt;right conoid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"helicoid\"&gt;helicoid&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"tangent%20developable\"&gt;tangent developable&lt;/a&gt; of a smooth &lt;a href=\"curve\"&gt;curve&lt;/a&gt; in space.\nA ruled surface can be described as the set of points swept by a moving straight line. For example, a cone is formed by keeping one point of a line fixed whilst moving another point along a &lt;a href=\"circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt;. A surface is \"doubly ruled\" if through every one of its points there are two distinct lines that lie on the surface. The &lt;a href=\"hyperbolic%20paraboloid\"&gt;hyperbolic paraboloid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"hyperboloid%20of%20one%20sheet\"&gt;hyperboloid of one sheet&lt;/a&gt; are doubly ruled surfaces. The plane is the only surface which contains at least three distinct lines through each of its points .\nThe properties of being ruled or doubly ruled are preserved by &lt;a href=\"projective%20map\"&gt;projective map&lt;/a&gt;s, and therefore are concepts of &lt;a href=\"projective%20geometry\"&gt;projective geometry&lt;/a&gt;. In algebraic geometry ruled surfaces are sometimes considered to be surfaces in affine or projective space over a field, but they are also sometimes considered as abstract algebraic surfaces without an embedding into affine or projective space, in which case \"straight line\" is understood to mean an affine or projective line.\nDefinition and parametric representation.\nA two dimensional &lt;a href=\"manifold%23differetiable%20manifold\"&gt;differentiable manifold&lt;/a&gt; is called a \"ruled surface\" if it is the &lt;a href=\"set%20%28mathematics%29%23Unions\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; of one parametric family of lines. The lines of this family are the \"generators\" of the ruled surface.\nA ruled surface can be described by a &lt;a href=\"parametric%20representation\"&gt;parametric representation&lt;/a&gt; of the form \nAny curve formula_2 with fixed parameter formula_3 is a generator (line) and the curve formula_4 is the \"directrix\" of the representation. The vectors formula_5 describe the directions of the generators.\nThe directrix may collapse to a point (in case of a cone, see example below).\nAlternatively the ruled surface (CR) can be described by\nwith the second directrix formula_7.\nAlternatively, one can start with two non intersecting curves formula_8 as directrices, and get by (CD) a ruled surface with line directions formula_9\nFor the generation of a ruled surface by two directrices (or one directrix and the vectors of line directions) not only the geometric shape of these curves are essential but also the special parametric representations of them influence the shape of the ruled surface (see examples a), d)).\nFor theoretical investigations representation (CR) is more advantageous, because the parameter formula_10 appears only once.\nExamples.\n&lt;a href=\"Right%20circular%20cylinder\"&gt;Right circular cylinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nformula_11:\nwith \n&lt;a href=\"Right%20circular%20cone\"&gt;Right circular cone&lt;/a&gt;.\nformula_16:\nwith formula_19&lt;br&gt;\nIn this case one could have used the apex as the directrix, i.e.: formula_20 and formula_21 as the line directions.\nFor any cone one can choose the apex as the directrix. This case shows: \"The directrix of a ruled surface may degenerate to a point\".\n&lt;a href=\"Helicoid\"&gt;Helicoid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe directrix formula_25 is the z-axis, the line directions are formula_26 and the second directrix formula_27 is a &lt;a href=\"helix\"&gt;helix&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe helicoid is a special case of the &lt;a href=\"Generalized%20helicoid%23Ruled%20generalized%20helicoids\"&gt;ruled generalized helicoids&lt;/a&gt;.\nCylinder, cone and &lt;a href=\"hyperboloid\"&gt;hyperboloid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe parametric representation \nhas two horizontal circles as directrices. The additional parameter formula_29 allows to vary the parametric representations of the circles. For\nA hyperboloid of one sheet is a \"doubly\" ruled surface.\n&lt;a href=\"Hyperbolic%20paraboloid\"&gt;Hyperbolic paraboloid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the two directrices in (CD) are the lines \none gets \nwhich is the hyperbolic paraboloid that interpolates the 4 points formula_39 bilinearly.\nObviously the ruled surface is a \"doubly ruled surface\", because any point lies on two lines of the surface.\nFor the example shown in the diagram: \nThe hyperbolic paraboloid has the equation formula_41.\n&lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6bius%20strip\"&gt;M\u00f6bius strip&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruled surface\nwith \ncontains a M\u00f6bius strip.\nThe diagram shows the M\u00f6bius strip for formula_45.\nA simple calculation shows formula_46 (see next section). Hence the given realization of a M\u00f6bius strip is \"not developable\". But there exist developable M\u00f6bius strips.\nTangent planes, developable surfaces.\nFor the considerations below any necessary derivative is assumed to exist.\nFor the determination of the normal vector at a point one needs the &lt;a href=\"partial%20derivative\"&gt;partial derivative&lt;/a&gt;s of the representation formula_47 :\nHence the normal vector is \nBecause of formula_51 (A mixed product with two equal vectors is always 0 !), vector formula_52 is a tangent vector at any point formula_53. The tangent planes along this line are all the same, if formula_54 is a multiple of formula_55 . This is possible only, if the three vectors formula_56 lie in a plane, i.e. they are linearly dependent. The linear dependency of three vectors can be checked using the determinant of these vectors:\nThe importance of this determinant condition shows the following statement:\nThe generators of any ruled surface coalesce with one family of its asymptotic lines. For developable surfaces they also form one family of its &lt;a href=\"Line%20of%20curvature\"&gt;lines of curvature&lt;/a&gt;. It can be shown that \"any developable\" surface is a cone, a cylinder or a surface formed by all tangents of a space curve.\nApplication and History of developable surfaces.\nThe determinant condition for developable surfaces is used to determine numerically developable connections between space curves (directrices). The diagram shows a developable connection between two ellipses contained in different planes (one horizontal, the other vertical) and its development.\nAn impression of the usage of developable surfaces in \"Computer Aided Design\" (&lt;a href=\"CAD\"&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt;) is given in \"Interactive design of developable surfaces\"\nA \"historical\" survey on developable surfaces can be found in \"Developable Surfaces: Their History and Application\"\nRuled surfaces in algebraic geometry.\nIn &lt;a href=\"algebraic%20geometry\"&gt;algebraic geometry&lt;/a&gt;, ruled surfaces were originally defined as &lt;a href=\"projective%20surface\"&gt;projective surface&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"projective%20space\"&gt;projective space&lt;/a&gt; containing a straight line through any given point. This immediately implies that there is a projective line on the surface through any given point, and this condition is now often used as the definition of a ruled surface: ruled surfaces are defined to be abstract projective surfaces satisfying this condition that there is a projective line through any point. This is equivalent to saying that they are &lt;a href=\"birational\"&gt;birational&lt;/a&gt; to the product of a curve and a projective line. Sometimes a ruled surface is defined to be one satisfying the stronger condition that it has a &lt;a href=\"fibration\"&gt;fibration&lt;/a&gt; over a curve with fibers that are projective lines. This excludes the projective plane, which has a projective line though every point but cannot be written as such a fibration.\nRuled surfaces appear in the &lt;a href=\"Enriques%20classification\"&gt;Enriques classification&lt;/a&gt; of projective complex surfaces, because every algebraic surface of &lt;a href=\"Kodaira%20dimension\"&gt;Kodaira dimension&lt;/a&gt; formula_61 is a ruled surface (or a projective plane, if one uses the restrictive definition of ruled surface). \nEvery minimal projective ruled surface other than the projective plane is the projective bundle of a 2-dimensional vector bundle over some curve. The ruled surfaces with base curve of genus 0 are the &lt;a href=\"Hirzebruch%20surface\"&gt;Hirzebruch surface&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRuled surfaces in architecture.\nDoubly ruled surfaces are the inspiration for curved &lt;a href=\"hyperboloid%20structure\"&gt;hyperboloid structure&lt;/a&gt;s that can be built with a &lt;a href=\"latticework\"&gt;latticework&lt;/a&gt; of straight elements, namely:\nThe &lt;a href=\"RM-81%20Agena\"&gt;RM-81 Agena&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rocket%20engine\"&gt;rocket engine&lt;/a&gt; employed straight &lt;a href=\"cooling%20channel\"&gt;cooling channel&lt;/a&gt;s that were laid out in a ruled surface to form the throat of the &lt;a href=\"nozzle\"&gt;nozzle&lt;/a&gt; section."
