In 2014, Gill St. Bernard's was ranked the number four private high school in New Jersey by national ranking service &lt;a href=\"Niche%20%28company%29\"&gt;Niche&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the 2017\u201318 school year, the school had an enrollment of 657 students (plus 32 in PreK) and 86.5 classroom teachers (on an &lt;a href=\"full-time%20equivalent\"&gt;FTE&lt;/a&gt; basis), for a &lt;a href=\"student%E2%80%93teacher%20ratio\"&gt;student\u2013teacher ratio&lt;/a&gt; of 7.6:1.

The upper school contains the Chapin Science Complex, the Hockenbury Building (Student Center, Library, and Humanities Classes), and Founders Hall (Art, Lunch, and Language, and Dining Hall) as well as the newly built Matthews Theater (music, drama, performing arts etc.)\nHistory.\nGill St. Bernard's is the result of the merger of two Somerset Hills institutions: St. Bernard's School for boys in Gladstone and The Gill School for girls.\nSt. Bernard's School was founded in 1900 by the Rev. Thomas A. Conover. In the early days, academic classes alternated with work in the carpentry shop, print shop or on the farm. Regular attendance at religious services was required. In 1956, boarding at St. Bernard's School was discontinued.\nThe Gill School was established by Miss Elizabeth Gill in 1934 as the Wychwood School. In 1940 Miss Gill's School moved to Stronghold, the former &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Dryden\"&gt;Dryden estate&lt;/a&gt; on Bernardsville mountain. \nIn 1972 St. Bernard's School merged with Miss Gill's School to become Gill St. Bernard's School. At this time the religious affiliation of St. Bernard's was discontinued. The new school hosted grades K\u20138 on the old Gill campus in Bernardsville and grades 9\u201312 on the St. Bernard's campus in Gladstone. The two divisions consolidated in 1997 on the Gladstone campus. Sid Rowell became Headmaster in 2001.\nToday, there are three divisions\u2014Lower, Middle and Upper\u2014located on which span the Somerset-Morris County line between the Borough of Peapack-Gladstone and &lt;a href=\"Chester%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Chester Township&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe school acquired Hi-Hills Day Camp in 2002, which had previously operated on the campus since the late 1960s. A new athletic center opened in fall 2004 that includes three full-sized basketball courts, administrative offices, and Brueckner Hall. The Hockenbury Academic Center, a academic building, opened in March 2009 and includes Upper School classrooms, student center, conference room and a school store. An addition to Founders Hall was completed in 2012 that included additional dining space and art studios. A new turf field was constructed in summer 2013. The school also features five playing fields, a track, seven, tennis courts, an outdoor swimming pool, and a low ropes course.\nExtracurricular activities.\nThe Gill St. Bernard's Knights compete in the &lt;a href=\"Skyland%20Conference\"&gt;Skyland Conference&lt;/a&gt; which is comprised of public and private high schools in &lt;a href=\"Hunterdon%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Hunterdon&lt;/a&gt;, Somerset and &lt;a href=\"Warren%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; counties and operates under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20State%20Interscholastic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NJSIAA). With 277 students in grades 10\u201312, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019\u201320 school year as Non-Public B for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 37 to 366 students in that grade range (equivalent to Group I for public schools).\nAthletic facilities include a field house, athletic center, seven all-weather tennis courts, outdoor track, two full size basketball courts, sport court, lacrosse wall, as well as soccer and sports fields.
