Hansen turned professional shortly after the games and was active as a professional until 1982.\nHansen fought for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Council\"&gt;WBC&lt;/a&gt; world light welterweight title in 1973, but was stopped by Italian &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Arcari%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Bruno Arcari&lt;/a&gt;.\nHansen won the &lt;a href=\"European%20Boxing%20Union\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; welterweight title in 1977 against Italian &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Scano\"&gt;Marco Scano&lt;/a&gt; but lost the title by disqualification in his first defense. In 1978 he was awarded a chance to regain the title against Frenchman &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Marion%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Alain Marion&lt;/a&gt; whom Hansen stopped in the 6th round of the title bout. Hansen later lost the title by disqualification. Hansen won the European title for the third time when he knocked out British European champion &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Boy%20Green\"&gt;Dave Boy Green&lt;/a&gt; in the third round.
