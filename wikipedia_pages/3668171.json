    "text": "Eastwood Town Football Club was an English &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Eastwood%2C%20Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Eastwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;. The club last participated in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One%20South\"&gt;Division One South&lt;/a&gt;, the eighth tier of English football.\nA new club, &lt;a href=\"Eastwood%20Community%20F.C.\"&gt;Eastwood Community F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, was formed in 2014 following the demise of Eastwood Town.\nHistory.\nEastwood Town were established in 1955. During the 1970s, the club competed in the &lt;a href=\"Midland%20League\"&gt;Midland League&lt;/a&gt;. In 1983, Eastwood were founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Counties%20East%20Football%20League\"&gt;Northern Counties East Football League&lt;/a&gt;. In 1987, they joined the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; but returned to the NCEL for the 2003\u201304 season.\nIn the 2008/09 season, Eastwood Town had a successful run in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, defeating &lt;a href=\"Wrexham%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wycombe Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; on their way to the third round of the competition. Eastwood finished as league champions and were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20North\"&gt;Conference North&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in their history.\nEastwood Town finished in 4th place for their first season in the Conference North, but were denied permission to take part in the play offs due to insufficient ground grading. As a result, the club was put up for sale by its owners.\nIn November 2013, the club was issued with a winding up petition over an unpaid tax bill of \u00a3168,000 and council officials barred the club from using the Coronation Park ground.\nAfter postponing five consecutive home games, the club resigned from the Northern Premier League in February 2014.\nStadium.\nThere had been a lot of work done in the background and plans had been drawn up to bring the ground up to the 'A' grade required to enter the Conference National. The plans showed new terracing holding 1900 fans behind both goals and a new seated stand replacing the Mabe Allan Stand almost down the entire length of the pitch. This would have given the club three fully enclosed stands and a capacity of over 5,000.\nWith the plans for the academy and the other projects, the club was in negotiations with the local authorities to take over the existing all-weather pitch situated within Coronation Park along with the changing rooms. The plan was to redevelop the pitch into a full sized 3G pitch, with the adjoining area being developed into an outdoor juniors pitch for use of the community and Eastwood Town Juniors. This would have given the club the infrastructure to attract the best local youngsters as well as players released from professional clubs academies.\nThe club had received a few complaints from residents on Chewton Street about the increased problems associated with matchday parking and this was another issue that had been raised and negotiations were in progress with the council to address the situation, with the objective of providing more car parking facilities at the club. The club were also in discussions with the council about additional signage off the A610, and the end of Chewton Street."
