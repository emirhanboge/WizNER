    "text": "The recorded history of Rockland County, New York begins on February 23, 1798, when the county was split off from &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Orange County, New York&lt;/a&gt; and formed as its own &lt;a href=\"County%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;administrative division of the state of New York&lt;/a&gt;. It is located north-northwest of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;New York Metropolitan Area&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; is the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"New%20City%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New City&lt;/a&gt;. The name comes from \"rocky land\", an early description of the area given by settlers. Rockland is New York's southernmost county west of the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt;. It is suburban in nature, with a considerable amount of scenic designated parkland. Rockland County does not border any of the New York City boroughs, but is only north of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; at the counties' (New York and Rockland) two respective closest points (Palisades, New York, in Rockland and Inwood Park in Manhattan)\nMost of the early settlers were &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20people\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, with a sprinkling of &lt;a href=\"Huguenot\"&gt;Huguenot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quaker\"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt; families. The settlers lived almost entirely off the land, &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"berries\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fruits\"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vegetables\"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"hunting\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"trapping\"&gt;trapping&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly attempts to settle the county by the Dutch were generally unsuccessful, and in 1664 they handed over the territory to the English. Yet the Dutch did leave a legacy in place names like &lt;a href=\"Dunderberg%20Mountain\"&gt;Dunderberg Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sparkill%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Sparkill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Tor%20State%20Park\"&gt;High Tor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a small collection of unique &lt;a href=\"American_colonial_architecture%23Dutch_Colonial\"&gt;sandstone houses&lt;/a&gt; like the 1700 &lt;a href=\"DeWint%20House\"&gt;DeWint House&lt;/a&gt;, built in &lt;a href=\"Tappan%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Tappan&lt;/a&gt; and still exists, which later served as &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s headquarters.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;, Rockland County was a strategic crossroads, camping ground and vital link between the northern and southern &lt;a href=\"Thirteen%20Colonies\"&gt;colonies&lt;/a&gt;. Troops often used &lt;a href=\"Verplanck%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Kings Ferry&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Stony Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dobbs%20Ferry%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Dobbs Ferry&lt;/a&gt; at Snedens Landing in &lt;a href=\"Palisades%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Palisades&lt;/a&gt;. The first post office in Rockland County was established at New Antrim, now &lt;a href=\"Suffern%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Suffern&lt;/a&gt;, on October 4, 1797.\nBy 1800, the total population of the newly created County of Rockland was nearly 6,400. The land was cleared, homes, schools and churches were built and &lt;a href=\"sawmills\"&gt;sawmills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gristmills\"&gt;gristmills&lt;/a&gt; erected along the numerous &lt;a href=\"Stream\"&gt;creeks&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1828, &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; had virtually disappeared from the county and &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; existed in a diminished form.\nHistory.\nThe area that became Rockland County was originally inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Algonquian%20languages\"&gt;Algonquian&lt;/a&gt;-speaking &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Munsee\"&gt;Munsee&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Lenni%20Lenape\"&gt;Lenni Lenape&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tappan%20tribe\"&gt;Tappan tribe&lt;/a&gt; had a particularly noteworthy presence in the area, extending from present-day &lt;a href=\"Nyack%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Nyack&lt;/a&gt;, south to &lt;a href=\"Sparkill\"&gt;Sparkill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tappan%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Tappan&lt;/a&gt;, down the &lt;a href=\"Hackensack%20River\"&gt;Hackensack River&lt;/a&gt; valley through present-day &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Bergen County, NJ&lt;/a&gt;, and also along the Palisades and Hudson shore all the way down to present-day &lt;a href=\"Edgewater%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Edgewater, NJ&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1609, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Hudson\"&gt;Henry Hudson&lt;/a&gt; was the first major Dutch explorer to arrive in the area. Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary \"&lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Passage\"&gt;Northwest Passage&lt;/a&gt;\", sailed on the \"&lt;a href=\"Halve%20Maen\"&gt;Half Moon&lt;/a&gt;\" up the river that would one day bear his name, and anchored near the area that is now &lt;a href=\"Haverstraw%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Haverstraw&lt;/a&gt; before continuing north of what is now &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years before 1664 when the area was formally a Dutch colony called &lt;a href=\"New%20Netherland\"&gt;New Netherland&lt;/a&gt;, present-day Rockland did not have formal European settlements. However, individuals did explore the area and made transactions with &lt;a href=\"Tappan%20tribe\"&gt;Tappan tribe&lt;/a&gt; for land with the idea that it could have future use. For example, in 1640, Dutch Captain &lt;a href=\"David%20Pietersz.%20de%20Vries\"&gt;David Pietersz. de Vries&lt;/a&gt; purchased from natives the area where the &lt;a href=\"Sparkill%20Creek\"&gt;Sparkill Creek&lt;/a&gt; flows into the Hudson River.\nIn 1664, the British Crown assumed control of New Netherland from the Dutch. In June of 1664, the &lt;a href=\"John%20Berkeley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Berkeley%20of%20Stratton\"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"George%20Carteret\"&gt;Carteret&lt;/a&gt; land grant established the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;colony of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, dividing present-day Rockland and Bergen Counties into separate political areas. The northern border of New Jersey was placed in a straight line from the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20River\"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt; at present-day &lt;a href=\"Port%20Jervis\"&gt;Port Jervis&lt;/a&gt; to the Hudson River at 41 degrees even North latitude, where the &lt;a href=\"The%20Palisades%20%28Hudson%20River%29\"&gt;Palisades Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; pause and give way to &lt;a href=\"Sneden%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Sneden's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orangetown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Orangetown&lt;/a&gt;. The state line remains there to this day, though various disagreements along the exact border were had over the years.\nIn the 1670s, permanent Dutch settlers began to arrive with land grants, starting with the Tappan area. These settlers were eager to escape \"city life\", moving from &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; to Rockland. A number of unique, Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.\nIn 1683, when the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20York\"&gt;Duke of York&lt;/a&gt; (who became King &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;James II of England&lt;/a&gt;) established the first 12 counties of New York, present-day Rockland County was part of &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, known then as \"Orange County South of the Mountains\". &lt;a href=\"Orangetown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Orangetown&lt;/a&gt; was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize &lt;a href=\"Nyack%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Nyack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tappan%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Tappan&lt;/a&gt;, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.\nThe natural barrier of the &lt;a href=\"Ramapo%20Mountains\"&gt;Ramapo Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the size of the county made carrying out governmental activities difficult. At one point, two governments were active, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains, so Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year, the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719, and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day &lt;a href=\"Clarkstown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Clarkstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramapo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ramapo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Stony Point&lt;/a&gt;. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland had &lt;a href=\"battle\"&gt;skirmishes&lt;/a&gt; at Haverstraw, Nyack, and &lt;a href=\"Piermont%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Piermont&lt;/a&gt;, and significant military engagements at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stony%20Point\"&gt;Battle of Stony Point&lt;/a&gt;, where General \"Mad\" &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Wayne\"&gt;Anthony Wayne&lt;/a&gt; earned his nickname. &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of &lt;a href=\"Suffern%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Suffern&lt;/a&gt;. British Major &lt;a href=\"John%20Andr%C3%A9\"&gt;John Andr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; met with American traitor &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20Arnold\"&gt;Benedict Arnold&lt;/a&gt; near Stony Point to buy the plans for the &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt;. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in &lt;a href=\"Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Tarrytown&lt;/a&gt; on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the &lt;a href=\"Reformed%20Church%20of%20Tappan\"&gt;Tappan church&lt;/a&gt;, found guilty, hanged, and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester\"&gt;Sir Guy Carleton&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"DeWint%20House\"&gt;DeWint House&lt;/a&gt;, where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later, Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day, the king's navy fired its first salute to the flag of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. Many buildings in New York City were built with bricks made in Rockland. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20Highlands\"&gt;Hudson Highlands&lt;/a&gt; on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href=\"E.%20H.%20Harriman\"&gt;E. H. Harriman&lt;/a&gt;, though, donated land and large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Mountain%20%28Hudson%20Highlands%29\"&gt;Bear Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Mountain%20State%20Park\"&gt;Bear Mountain&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Harriman%20State%20Park%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Harriman State Park&lt;/a&gt; became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914, more than an estimated one million people a year were coming to the park. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Rockland County became the most important sausage-making hub in New York.\nRockland remained semirural until the 1950s, when the &lt;a href=\"Palisades%20Interstate%20Parkway\"&gt;Palisades Interstate Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tappan%20Zee%20Bridge%20%281955%E2%80%932017%29\"&gt;Tappan Zee Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and other major arteries were built. In the decades that followed, the county became a maturely developed suburb of New York City. As people moved up from the five boroughs (particularly the Bronx in the early years) the population flourished from 89,276 in 1950 to 338,329 in 2020. A 379% Increase.\nHistorical settlements.\nIn the 19th century, the following settlements were created in these towns. Several have been renamed, some expanded and others disappeared.\nThe naming of settlements mostly derived from the person who owned the land, the geography of the location. Currently Rockland County is one of 24 areas in New York State designated a &lt;a href=\"Preserve%20America%20Community\"&gt;Preserve America Community&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorical places of Rockland County.\nSee &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places listings in Rockland County, New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmerican Revolutionary War and War of 1812.\nTwo important battles took place in Rockland County during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the capture by the British of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Clinton%20%28West%20Point%29\"&gt;Fort Clinton&lt;/a&gt; at Bear Mountain in October 1777 and the victorious attack by General \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne's army on the British fort at Stony Point in July 1779. Rockland was also the site of the first formal recognition of the new nation by the British. On May 5, 1783, General George Washington received the British Commander, &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester\"&gt;Sir Guy Carleton&lt;/a&gt;, at the 1700 &lt;a href=\"DeWint%20House\"&gt;DeWint House&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the terms of the peace treaty. On May 7, 1783, Sir Guy Carleton received General George Washington aboard his vessel \"Perseverance\". On this day, the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Rockland turned out more soldiers in proportion than any other county in the state. Four Union generals and four Medal of Honor recipients lived in Rockland.\nRockland County's historical and notable people from the past.\nHistorical figures who came to Rockland County.\n &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Burr\"&gt;Aaron Burr&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 3rd Vice President of the United States.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Hamilton\"&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1st &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury\"&gt;United States Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Harrison\"&gt;Benjamin Harrison&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 23rd President of the United States. \n&lt;a href=\"Millard%20Fillmore\"&gt;Millard Fillmore&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 13th President of the United States. \n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin Delano Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 then governor of the State of New York and afterwards the 32nd President of the United States. \n&lt;a href=\"George%20Clinton%20%28vice%20president%29\"&gt;George Clinton&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 First (and longest-serving) elected &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Governor of New York&lt;/a&gt;, and then 4th Vice President of the United States. \n&lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1st President of the United States (1776\u20131783) Approximately 20 times. \n&lt;a href=\"Grover%20Cleveland\"&gt;Grover Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 22nd and 24th President of the United States. \n&lt;a href=\"Harry%20S.%20Truman\"&gt;Harry S.

She devoted herself to the care of her only child, a son by a previous marriage, named Tobias Lowrie. She treated, with great results, neighbors that came to her with &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s and methods she learned from her late husband. But \"Naut Kannif\", as she was called, seemed to have been exceedingly eccentric. According to the people at that time she dressed oddly, had strange hairdos and was unsociable. She was regarded as insane \u2013 worse yet \u2013 a &lt;a href=\"Witchcraft\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; in an era of superstition. It was decided to take \"Naut\" to Auert Polhemus's grist mill and using his great flour scales weigh her against the old Holland Dutch family &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;, iron bound, with wooden covers and iron chain to carry it by. If outweighed by the Bible, she must be a witch beyond any doubt, and must suffer accordingly. She was taken to the mill against her most earnest protest, put on the scales, and weighed. Weighing more than the Bible, the committee released her. This was the last witch trial in the state of New York.\nHangings in Rockland County.\nThere are three recorded &lt;a href=\"hangings\"&gt;hangings&lt;/a&gt; in Rockland County. They all took place in the 18th century.\nEarly industries.\nThe earliest of its industries was the growing of foodstuffs for the great city. &lt;a href=\"Iona%20Island%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Iona Island&lt;/a&gt;, known as Weyant's Island became famous with the noted Iona &lt;a href=\"grape\"&gt;grape&lt;/a&gt; as well as hundreds of &lt;a href=\"fruit%20trees\"&gt;fruit trees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nBesides &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boat%20building\"&gt;boat building&lt;/a&gt; was one of the early industries until after the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Johnsontown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Johnsontown&lt;/a&gt; in Haverstraw was the seat of the first boat building. Nanuet ran a Lumber business. The &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20people\"&gt;mountain people&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ladentown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ladentown&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href=\"baskets\"&gt;baskets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barrel\"&gt;beer barrel hoops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bowls\"&gt;bowls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chairs\"&gt;chairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ladle%20%28spoon%29\"&gt;ladles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20spoon\"&gt;spoons&lt;/a&gt; they made from the wood and reeds found in the mountain to sell or take to New York City to be sold.\nMills, both saw and grist, were among the first industries of the county. As early as 1792, &lt;a href=\"tanneries\"&gt;tanneries&lt;/a&gt; were in existence. Theill's Corners, named after a &lt;a href=\"Danes\"&gt;Dane&lt;/a&gt; who came to the locality previous to the Revolution erected a forge. Water power of the Minisceongo was used for grinding grist in 1793;\nA 120-foot dam was constructed across the Ramapo River. By 1813, The Ramapo Works, owned by the Pierson brothers were producing a million pounds of &lt;a href=\"nail%20%28fastener%29\"&gt;nail&lt;/a&gt;s annually. The addition of a &lt;a href=\"cotton%20mill\"&gt;cotton mill&lt;/a&gt; in 1814, and later &lt;a href=\"woolen%20mills\"&gt;woolen mills&lt;/a&gt;, nearly doubled the size of the Works, which in 1822 were incorporated under the name \"Ramapo Manufacturing Company.\" During its heyday, the Pierson nail factory was a powerful economic stimulus to the region because of its links to existing agricultural and commercial trade. Ramapo developed into an agricultural marketplace and a locale for &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; innovations. Garnerville was the home of the John Suffern Paper Mill in 1850, and print cotton textile factories. West Haverstraw, once known as Samsondale, was where a large &lt;a href=\"rolling%20mill\"&gt;rolling mill&lt;/a&gt; was started in 1830;\nRamapo built its early reputation in the iron industry. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20mining\"&gt;Iron mining&lt;/a&gt; was opened up by an English company in 1768 and in 1771 a nickel mine. Because of the proximity of iron mines, numerous metal products were made \u2013 &lt;a href=\"plows\"&gt;plows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoe%20%28tool%29\"&gt;hoes&lt;/a&gt;, railings, nails, &lt;a href=\"machinery\"&gt;machinery&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=\"Round%20shot\"&gt;cannonballs&lt;/a&gt;. The Ramapo Wheel and Foundry Company, organized in 1873, took the prize among all competitors for the productions of their wheels at the &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; Exposition of 1873.\nGrey and red sandstones were quarried in great quantities, Building stone from local quarries went into the old Capitol at Albany, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lafayette\"&gt;Fort Lafayette&lt;/a&gt; and the old &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Trinity Church&lt;/a&gt; in New York destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fire%20of%20New%20York%20%281776%29\"&gt;Great Fire of New York (1776)&lt;/a&gt;, and the first building at &lt;a href=\"Rutgers%20College\"&gt;Rutgers College&lt;/a&gt;. In 1838 Calvin Tomkins and his brother Daniel purchased approximately of land, located in a cove north of the Stony Point promontory, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; was found in usable quantities suitable for burning along the river shore for the purpose of making lime.\nRockland factories made &lt;a href=\"shoes\"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; hats, &lt;a href=\"silk\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; cloth, sulfur &lt;a href=\"matches\"&gt;matches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tobacco%20pipe\"&gt;smoking pipes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pianos\"&gt;pianos&lt;/a&gt;. But the greatest of the industries was the making of brick followed by the ice harvesting.\nThe first bricks, made for public market, were baked in 1810 on the banks of the Minisceongo, but not until James Wood, of England, set up a &lt;a href=\"brick%20kiln\"&gt;brick kiln&lt;/a&gt; at Haverstraw, in 1817, was the first successful plant erected. Wood developed the modern way of mixing &lt;a href=\"coal%20dust\"&gt;coal dust&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, in 1828, which revolutionized the manufacture of brick. Commonly referred to as \"Bricktown\", Haverstraw was famous for its brick-making, which was a major industry for the village. Brick-making was so popular due to the clay formed by the Hudson River's water and the rich soil that lined Haverstraw's waterfront, that it was nicknamed the \"Brickmaking Capital of the World\". Many of the old &lt;a href=\"brownstone\"&gt;brownstone&lt;/a&gt; and brick structures that were constructed in New York City in the late 1890s-early 1900s were composed of bricks manufactured by Haverstraw. At one point, in the early 20th century, there were more than 40 brick-making factories lining the Hudson River within the village. Although brick-making involved all the ethnic groups, 60 percent of the brickyard workers were African-Americans.\nRockland Lake, a beautiful sheet of water a half mile back from the Hudson, at an elevation of more the 150 feet above that river was and is the most notable natural lake and the source of one of the largest branches of the Hackensack River.\nRockland Lake, known to have had the cleanest and purest ice in the area was harvested by The Knickerbocker Ice Company established 1831. The company harvested thousands of tons of ice from the lake each year and once harvested 1 million tons of ice. The wooden storehouse's walls were insulated with &lt;a href=\"sawdust\"&gt;sawdust&lt;/a&gt; to keep the ice blocks frozen until they were shipped in the summer. By 1834, the company owned a dozen steamboats, 75 ice barges and employed about 3,000 to ship ice countrywide. The stored ice was placed on inclined railroad cars, transported down the mountainside, placed on barges on the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; and shipped to New York City. Slaughter's Landing was used as the shipping point for the Ice harvested at Rockland Lake. So much ice was shipped that Rockland Lake became known as the \"Icehouse of New York City\".\nTransportation during the earlier years.\nStagecoach.\nRoads were primitive and transporting products from the western end of the county to the Hudson River was very difficult. After legislative approval, it took 17 years to complete the &lt;a href=\"New_York_State_Route_59%23History\"&gt;Nyack Turnpike&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-country carriage road which connected Nyack to Suffern. The &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; which crossed the Ramapo Pass, was heavily traveled in &lt;a href=\"winter\"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; when the Hudson River froze over to travel between &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, New York and New York City.\nHistoric steamboats.\nWith the lack of roads, travel was largely confined to &lt;a href=\"sloops\"&gt;sloops&lt;/a&gt;, which made regular trips up and down the river. &lt;a href=\"Steamboats\"&gt;Steamboats&lt;/a&gt; were built to travel up and down the Hudson, carrying both passengers and freight. Steamboats provided much of the transportation to New York City. Steamboat navigation in Rockland started with a local steam vessel named the \"Orange\" referred by some as \"Pot-Cheese\" in reference to her beauty and others \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\" because of her speed. She provided regular schedule between Nyack and New York. The &lt;a href=\"North%20River%20Steamboat\"&gt;North River Steamboat&lt;/a&gt; or North River (often erroneously referred to as Clermont) is widely regarded as the world's first commercially successful steamboat. It was not until twenty years later that a boat was used that could be depended on to make a round trip in one day attracting competition from steamboats later built at Haverstraw and Tappan. To facilitate steamboat traffic from &lt;a href=\"Tappan%20Landing\"&gt;Tappan Landing&lt;/a&gt;, a road was built over the &lt;a href=\"marshes\"&gt;marshes&lt;/a&gt; to the end of a 500-foot pier, which within a few years became the terminus of the &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Railroad%23New%20York%20%26amp%3B%20Erie%20Railroad\"&gt;New York &amp; Erie Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of this road was an invaluable aid in the development of the county. It caused the building of &lt;a href=\"Piermont%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Piermont&lt;/a&gt; with its lone pier which made possible the founding of a half dozen villages and opened the way to the utilization of the mineral and agricultural resources of Rockland. Other railroads followed. The first steamer bringing passengers to the railroad for the historic trip from Piermont to Ramapo was named \"\"South American\" and the steamer \"Utica\"\" brought passengers from New York City on the opening of the Erie railroad to &lt;a href=\"Goshen%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Goshen, New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nHudson River Day liners included &lt;a href=\"PS%20Alexander%20Hamilton\"&gt;PS Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PS%20Chauncey%20Vibbard\"&gt;PS Chauncey Vibbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PS%20Washington%20Irving\"&gt;PS Washington Irving&lt;/a&gt;\nProminent Hudson River steamboats included &lt;a href=\"Robert%20R.%20Livingston%20%28chancellor%29\"&gt;Chancellor Livingston&lt;/a&gt; (1816), &lt;a href=\"James%20Kent%20%28jurist%29\"&gt;James Kent&lt;/a&gt; (1823), &lt;a href=\"DeWitt%20Clinton\"&gt;DeWitt Clinton&lt;/a&gt; (1828), &lt;a href=\"Robert%20L.%20Stevens\"&gt;Robert L.

The President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, 13th President of the United States and the Secretary of State, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Webster\"&gt;Daniel Webster&lt;/a&gt;, along with a score of national and state officials, boarded the train at the Piermont Pier for the first trip. Back in the 19th century railroads, &lt;a href=\"Freight%20train\"&gt;freight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Train\"&gt;passenger&lt;/a&gt; lines, were instrumental for the development, growth and prosperity of Rockland County. Many of the hamlets and villages were built near the Depots. Most of the Post Offices were built near the stations. Passengers traveling to New York City would board &lt;a href=\"Steamboat\"&gt;steamers&lt;/a&gt; at Piermont. The first five locomotives were \"\"Eleazar Lord\", \"Piermont\", \"\"Rockland\", \"Orange\" and \"Ramapo\"\" respectively.\n(A) &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20and%20New%20York%20Railroad\"&gt;The New Jersey &amp; New York Railroad&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1875\n(B) New City Branch NJ&amp;NY Railroad\n(C) &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Railroad\"&gt;Erie Railroad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Piermont%20Branch\"&gt;Piermont Branch&lt;/a&gt; \u22121870\n(D) &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Branch\"&gt;Northern Railroad of NJ&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 1859\n(E) &lt;a href=\"West%20Shore%20Railroad\"&gt;New York, West Shore &amp; Buffalo Railroad&lt;/a&gt; \u22121883\n(F) &lt;a href=\"Main%20Line%20%28NJ%20Transit%29\"&gt;Main Line&lt;/a&gt;\n(G) \u2013 May 18, 1864.\nRockland County places of interest.\nThe Dunderberg Spiral Railway.\nA pleasure railroad partially constructed in 1890\u20131891 and never finished. The first part of the ride would have taken the cars up two inclined planes to the summit above the Hudson River, where visitors could disembark to enjoy the scenery. Then the cars would have coasted by gravity down a nine-mile (14\u00a0km) scenic railway, making two spirals and three switchbacks. It would have been to this day the biggest roller coaster ever constructed.\nPiermont hand-cranked drawbridge.\nThe Piermont hand-cranked &lt;a href=\"drawbridge\"&gt;drawbridge&lt;/a&gt; was originally built in 1880 by The &lt;a href=\"King%20Bridge%20Company\"&gt;King Iron Bridge Company&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; company in the state of &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; that constructed more than 10,000 bridges over six decades. The hand-cranked drawbridge is used as a pedestrian walkway providing a link to &lt;a href=\"Tallman%20Mountain%20State%20Park\"&gt;Tallman Mountain State Park&lt;/a&gt;. This bridge is the only hand-cranked drawbridge in Rockland County and perhaps in the United States. Back in the day, fishermen on &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt;s heading up and down the creek got out of their vessel, cranked up the drawbridge, sailed across, got out of their vessel and cranked down the drawbridge for vehicular traffic. The whole bridge was dismantled piece by piece, sent off-site for restoration and restored to its original state after a complete forensic analysis. Allan King Sloan, the great-great-grandson of the company's founder, provided some of the information that is on the historical marker nearby and attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 2009.\nArt gallery.\nHistoric paintings.\nThe following artists studied at the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River%20School\"&gt;Hudson River School&lt;/a&gt;:"
