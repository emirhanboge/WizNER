The station was an &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt; affiliate in the late 1990s and early 2000s before losing it to then-rival &lt;a href=\"WTKI\"&gt;WTKI&lt;/a&gt; (1450 AM) in late 2002. The affiliation returned to WUMP on February 6, 2007, after WTKI was sold and changed formats.\nHistory.\nLaunch at 1360 AM.\nThis station received its original &lt;a href=\"construction%20permit\"&gt;construction permit&lt;/a&gt; for a 500-&lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt; station broadcasting on 1360 &lt;a href=\"kHz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; on September 13, &lt;a href=\"1982%20in%20radio\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;. The new station was assigned the call letters WABT by the FCC. WABT received its &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20license\"&gt;license to cover&lt;/a&gt; from the FCC on June 19, 1983. The station aired a &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt; format to start with.\nIn June 1985, The Great American Broadcasting Corporation reached an agreement to sell WABT to Excelsior Broadcasting Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 19, 1985, and the transaction was consummated on January 22, 1986.\nMove to 730 AM.\nThe station had applied to the FCC in September 1983 to change frequencies from 1360\u00a0kHz to 730\u00a0kHz and increase power to 1,000 watts. In July 1985, after WJMW moved from 730\u00a0kHz to 770\u00a0kHz, the FCC issued a construction permit for the changes. The new owners had the FCC change the station's callsign to WDKT on December 26, 1985.\nWith new ownership, new call letters, a new frequency, and increased power in place, the station changed to an &lt;a href=\"urban%20contemporary\"&gt;urban contemporary&lt;/a&gt; format branded as \"D-73\".\nFinancial problems.\nFacing increasing financial difficulties, in February 1989 the license for this station was involuntarily transferred from Excelsior Broadcasting Corporation to Excelsior Broadcasting Corporation, Debtor-In-Possession. The involuntary transfer was approved by the FCC on March 2, 1989. In April 1989, Vascular Diagnostic Labs bought out the previous shareholders of Excelsior Broadcasting Corporation, the licensee for this station. The transfer of control was approved by the FCC on July 13, 1989.\nIn August 1989, with the financial issues resolved and the previous shareholders bought out, Excelsior Broadcasting Corporation was dissolved and the license was involuntarily transferred to Vascular Diagnostic Labs owner Dr. Merlin Kelsick. The transfer was approved by the FCC on November 29, 1990.\nNews and talk.\nThe call letters were changed to WBBI on August 19, 1991, after Dr. Merlin Kelsick completed a deal to sell the station to Phoenix Capital Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 12, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on September 17, 1991. The station then switched to a &lt;a href=\"news%20radio\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"talk%20radio\"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; format.\nThe station's callsign was changed to WKMW on June 1, 1993. In June 1993, Phoenix Capital Corporation reached an agreement to sell WKMW to Madison Radio Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 19, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on October 28, 1993.\nSports radio.\nIn May 1995, Madison Radio Company, Inc., reached an agreement to sell the station to Tennessee Valley Radio, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 31, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on October 3, 1995. The new owners had the FCC change the station's call letters to the current WUMP on October 6, 1995. The new call sign was chosen to match the station's new &lt;a href=\"sports%20radio\"&gt;sports radio&lt;/a&gt; format and branding as \"The Ump\", an abbreviation of &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aumpire\"&gt;umpire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorporate ownership.\nThe Dunnavant family of Athens owned the station from the early 1990s until agreeing to sell it to Cumulus Broadcasting in 2003. This ended a 55-year presence in the area by Athens Broadcasting, founded in 1948 by Homer Felix \"Pap\" Dunnavant.\nOn April 1, 2003, WUMP was sold by Athens Broadcasting Co. (William E. Dunnavant, president) to Cumulus Broadcasting Inc. as part of a four-station deal with a total sale price of $22 million in cash and Cumulus common stock. The acquisition of the stations was completed in July 2003. WUMP remains co-owned with former Dunnavant stations &lt;a href=\"WVNN%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WVNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WZYP\"&gt;WZYP&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=\"WHRP\"&gt;WHRP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WWFF-FM\"&gt;WWFF-FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nTranslators.\nWUMP's programming is also carried on a &lt;a href=\"broadcast%20translator\"&gt;broadcast translator&lt;/a&gt; station to extend or improve the coverage area of the station. WUMP programming first appeared on the FM signal on November 26, 2008."
