    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; is an annual &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; competition established in 1895, with &lt;a href=\"Horace%20Rawlins\"&gt;Horace Rawlins&lt;/a&gt; winning the inaugural championship. It is run by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Golf%20Association\"&gt;United States Golf Association&lt;/a&gt; (USGA). The championship was not held from 1917 to 1918 or from 1942 to 1945 due to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThe U.S. Open is currently the third of four &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major championships&lt;/a&gt; to be played each year. U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;Open Championship&lt;/a&gt; (British Open), and the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Championship\"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;) for the next five years, and earn a ten-year exemption from qualifying for the U.S. Open. They also receive membership on the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt; for the following five seasons and invitations to &lt;a href=\"The%20Players%20Championship\"&gt;The Players Championship&lt;/a&gt; for the five years following their victories. The champion receives a gold champion's medal, and the U.S. Open Championship Cup, which the winner is allowed to keep for a year.\n&lt;a href=\"Willie%20Anderson%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Willie Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jones%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Bobby Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Hogan\"&gt;Ben Hogan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Nicklaus\"&gt;Jack Nicklaus&lt;/a&gt; hold the record for the most U.S. Open victories, with four victories each. Anderson holds the record for most consecutive wins with three (1903\u201305). &lt;a href=\"Hale%20Irwin\"&gt;Hale Irwin&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest winner of the U.S. Open: he was old when he won in &lt;a href=\"1990%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;. The youngest winner of the U.S. Open is &lt;a href=\"John%20McDermott%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;John McDermott&lt;/a&gt; who was old when he won in &lt;a href=\"1911%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1911&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rory%20McIlroy\"&gt;Rory McIlroy&lt;/a&gt; holds the record for the lowest aggregate score in &lt;a href=\"2011%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; at 268. &lt;a href=\"Rory%20McIlroy\"&gt;Rory McIlroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brooks%20Koepka\"&gt;Brooks Koepka&lt;/a&gt; share the record for the lowest score in relation to par with their winning scores of -16. \nThe U.S. Open has been won &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20golf%23W\"&gt;wire-to-wire&lt;/a&gt; by seven golfers on eight occasions: 1914 by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Hagen\"&gt;Walter Hagen&lt;/a&gt;, 1921 by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Barnes\"&gt;Jim Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, 1953 by Hogan, 1970 by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Jacklin\"&gt;Tony Jacklin&lt;/a&gt;, 2000 and 2002 by &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Woods\"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;, 2011 by McIlroy, and 2014 by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Kaymer\"&gt;Martin Kaymer&lt;/a&gt;. Eight others have led wire-to-wire in nine tournaments if ties after a round are counted: Willie Anderson in 1903, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Smith%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Alex Smith&lt;/a&gt; in 1906, &lt;a href=\"Chick%20Evans\"&gt;Chick Evans&lt;/a&gt; in 1916, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Bolt\"&gt;Tommy Bolt&lt;/a&gt; in 1958, Nicklaus in 1972 and 1980, &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Green\"&gt;Hubert Green&lt;/a&gt; in 1977, &lt;a href=\"Payne%20Stewart\"&gt;Payne Stewart&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, and &lt;a href=\"Retief%20Goosen\"&gt;Retief Goosen&lt;/a&gt; in 2001."
