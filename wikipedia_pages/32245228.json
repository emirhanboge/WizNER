    "text": "John Romonosky (July 7, 1929 \u2013 October 2, 2011) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; player. A , right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, he played parts of three seasons in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in 32 &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; for the 1953 &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and the 1958\u201359 &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt; career spanned 13 seasons between 1949 and 1961.\nAfter his first recall from the minor leagues, Romonosky &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; two games for the Cardinals at the end of the 1953 campaign, earning no &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decisions&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, in his Major League debut against the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Braves%20%281953%E2%80%9369%29\"&gt;Milwaukee Braves&lt;/a&gt;, the second game of a Sunday &lt;a href=\"Doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20County%20Stadium\"&gt;County Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the game ended in a 3\u20133 &lt;a href=\"tie%20game\"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt; after eight &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; of play. Romonosky allowed three &lt;a href=\"earned%20runs\"&gt;earned runs&lt;/a&gt; and seven &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in six innings, with two &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSent back to the minors by St. Louis for the 1954 season, Romonosky didn't return to the majors until July 1958 as a member of the Senators. He started five games during that month, but won only one game (losing the other four) and he worked out of the bullpen for the remainder of the 1958 campaign, appearing in 18 total MLB games. He began the next season with Washington, and worked in 12 more contests, two as a starter. He posted a career-best 3.29 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; that season, but did not pitch in a big-league game after July 27 and spent part of the season with the Double-A &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%20Lookouts\"&gt;Chattanooga Lookouts&lt;/a&gt;. However, in his final Major League game in September 1959, he &lt;a href=\"pinch%20runner\"&gt;pinch-ran&lt;/a&gt; for Senators' slugger &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Sievers\"&gt;Roy Sievers&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth inning and scored the winning &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; in a 5\u20134 win over the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Stadium\"&gt;Griffith Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll told, Romonosky yielded 97 hits and 51 &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; in 101\u2153 major league innings, with 63 strikeouts."
