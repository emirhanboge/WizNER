    "text": "Tocoi Creek High School (TCHS) is a new &lt;a href=\"State%20school\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; in the north central area of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;St. Johns County, Florida&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"World%20Golf%20Village\"&gt;World Golf Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida\"&gt;St. Augustine&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%20County%20School%20District\"&gt;St. Johns County School District&lt;/a&gt; and opened to students for the 2021-22 academic year.\nOverview.\nTCHS operated with students in grades 9-11 for its first year in 2021-22 and will offer grade 12 the following academic year. Three career academy labs, which will focus on healthcare, emerging technologies, and construction management, will be available along with a dual enrollment program to earn college credits through &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%20River%20State%20College\"&gt;St. Johns River State College&lt;/a&gt;. The school will also offer &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Placement\"&gt;Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt; coursework.\nThe school plans to establish full performance band, orchestra, and jazz ensembles and host theatrical productions in its dedicated auditorium.\nWith the addition of TCHS, the school district adjusted attendance zoning so some students who previously attended &lt;a href=\"Allen%20D.%20Nease%20High%20School\"&gt;Allen D. Nease High School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bartram%20Trail%20High%20School\"&gt;Bartram Trail High School&lt;/a&gt; will instead attend the new school. The primary feeder schools are Pacetti Bay Middle School and Mill Creek Academy.\nNamesake.\nThe school is named after a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Johns%20River\"&gt;St. Johns River&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Tocoi%20Creek\"&gt;Tocoi Creek&lt;/a&gt;, which was once home to the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Tocoi%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tocoi&lt;/a&gt;. Tocoi is a &lt;a href=\"Timucua\"&gt;Timucua&lt;/a&gt;n word that means &lt;a href=\"Nymphaeaceae\"&gt;water lily&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; Timucua lived in what is now present day northern &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and southeast &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name was chosen by the St. Johns County school board on December 8, 2020. The board considered the name North River High School, but ultimately Tocoi Creek High School received the majority of votes.\nHistory.\nConstruction of TCHS was funded by a half-cent &lt;a href=\"sales%20tax\"&gt;sales tax&lt;/a&gt; approved by county residents. Culpepper Construction Company of &lt;a href=\"Tallahassee%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/a&gt; secured a $60.8 million contract to build the school, and the school was designed by &lt;a href=\"Orlando%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;-based SchenkelShultz Architecture.\nIn December 2020, the school announced its nickname would be the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Fighting%20Bull\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt; with school colors of burnt orange, gunmetal gray, and black. The Toros logo and visual identity was designed by Rhodes Branding, a marketing agency based in &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Columbia, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. During the mascot naming process, the school's inaugural principal, Jay Willets, said that bulls or toros would be an appropriate name because the land the school now sits on was a cow pasture prior to the school's construction. This land was formerly owned by the &lt;a href=\"Pacetti\"&gt;Pacetti&lt;/a&gt; family who sold the 68.79 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; plot to the school district for just over $7 million in August 2019.\nTCHS was initially anticipated to open to students on August 10, 2021, but the St. Johns County school board voted to delay the start of the county's 2021-22 school year by 6 days, in part to give a cushion for more time to complete construction projects at TCHS and Pine Island Academy, a new &lt;a href=\"Kindergarten\"&gt;Kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; through eighth grade school in the county.\nAthletics.\nTCHS plans to offer athletics programs in football, volleyball, baseball, softball, swimming and diving, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, tennis, golf, weightlifting, cross country, track and field, competitive cheer, competitive dance, and wrestling.\nThe school's athletic director announced in February 2021 that TCHS would be hiring over 60 athletic staff positions and that the Toros have partnered with Baker's Sporting Goods of &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adidas\"&gt;adidas&lt;/a&gt; for equipment and apparel.\nFootball.\nThe Toros will compete as an independent in football for their inaugural season in 2021, a decision made by the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Florida High School Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt;. The first football game in school history is scheduled against &lt;a href=\"Paxon%20School%20for%20Advanced%20Studies\"&gt;Paxon&lt;/a&gt; on August 20, 2021 and will take place at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Augustine%20High%20School%20%28St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida%29\"&gt;St. Augustine High School&lt;/a&gt;."
