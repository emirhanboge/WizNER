    "text": "K-64 was a &lt;a href=\"state%20highway\"&gt;state highway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pratt%20County%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Pratt County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. The highway was a partial bypass of &lt;a href=\"Pratt%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Pratt&lt;/a&gt; that ran from &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20281%20in%20Kansas\"&gt;U.S. Route 281&lt;/a&gt; (US-281) just south of the city limits to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2054%20in%20Kansas\"&gt;US-54&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20400%20in%20Kansas\"&gt;US-400&lt;/a&gt; east of them. The route was maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Kansas Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; until July 10, 2015 when the road was turned over to Pratt County. K-64 was not part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore state highways were numbered in Kansas there were &lt;a href=\"auto%20trail\"&gt;auto trail&lt;/a&gt;s. The eastern terminus follows the former Cannon Ball Route and Atlantic and Pacific Highway. K-64 was designated around 1932, and paved in 1937. It was decommissioned July 10, 2015, after the Kansas Department of Transportation expanded several miles of US-54 and US-400 east of Pratt to four lanes. In exchange for the expansion, Pratt County agreed to take control of K-64.\nRoute description.\nK-64 began at an intersection with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20281%20in%20Kansas\"&gt;US-281&lt;/a&gt; just south of &lt;a href=\"Pratt%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Pratt&lt;/a&gt;. The highway went east on a two-lane road through a hilly, slightly wooded area. The road passed south of an unnamed lake, then turned to the north. The route then crossed the south fork of the &lt;a href=\"Ninnescah%20River\"&gt;Ninnescah River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20and%20Oklahoma%20Railroad\"&gt;Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad&lt;/a&gt; before reaching its northern terminus at a &lt;a href=\"T%20intersection\"&gt;T intersection&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2054%20in%20Kansas\"&gt;US-54&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20400\"&gt;US-400&lt;/a&gt;.\nK-64 was maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Kansas Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (KDOT). In 2012, the traffic on the route, calculated in &lt;a href=\"annual%20average%20daily%20traffic\"&gt;annual average daily traffic&lt;/a&gt;, was 750 vehicles per day on the north\u2013south section and 1260 vehicles per day on the east\u2013west section. K-64 was not a part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt;, which is a system of highways considered important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-64 did connect to the National Highway System at its eastern terminus.\nHistory.\nPrior to the formation of the Kansas state highway system, there were &lt;a href=\"auto%20trail\"&gt;auto trail&lt;/a&gt;s, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in the early part of the 20th century. The eastern terminus follows the former Cannon Ball Route and Atlantic and Pacific Highway.\nK-64 was designated by 1932, and at that time extended from K-8 east then north to US-54. Then between July 1938 and 1940, K-8 was renumbered to US-281. The route was paved with an oil surface in 1937, and it had not changed until it was decommissioned. K-64 was decommissioned on July 10, 2015, after KDOT had expanded several miles of US-54 and US-400 east of Pratt to four lanes. After the expansion, Pratt County agreed to take control of K-64."
