    "text": "Pacific coast may be used to reference any &lt;a href=\"coastline\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; that borders the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAmericas.\nCountries on the western side of the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; have a Pacific coast as their western or southwestern border, except for &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, where the Pacific coast is primarily on its southern border. The first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean were able to do so by crossing the narrow Panama &lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt;. The unique position of Panama in relation to the Pacific Ocean resulted in the ocean initially being named the South Sea.\nAsia.\nCountries on the &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;southeastern&lt;/a&gt; sides of &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; have a Pacific coast as part (or all) of their border.\nAustralia and Oceania.\nAustralia's Pacific coast is on its eastern border. Countries in &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; may have a Pacific coast anywhere, including their entire border."
