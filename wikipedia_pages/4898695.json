    "text": "The Nanticoke Generating Station was a &lt;a href=\"coal-fired%20power%20station\"&gt;coal-fired power station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nanticoke%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Nanticoke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in operation from 1972 to 2013. It was the largest coal power station in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and, at full capacity, it could provide 3,964\u00a0MW of &lt;a href=\"Electric%20power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; into the southern &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Electric%20power%20transmission\"&gt;power grid&lt;/a&gt; from its base in &lt;a href=\"Nanticoke%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Nanticoke&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and provided as much as 15% of Ontario's electricity.\nIt was decommissioned in 2013 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Government of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;'s commitment to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Coal%20in%20Canada\"&gt;coal power&lt;/a&gt;. A 44 MW &lt;a href=\"photovoltaic%20power%20station\"&gt;photovoltaic power station&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nanticoke%20Solar%20Facility\"&gt;Nanticoke Solar Facility&lt;/a&gt;, was built on the site and entered service in 2019. \nPrior to the commencement of decommissioning, Nanticoke was one of Canada's top ten single sources of &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gases\"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Nanticoke Generating Station was built on the site of the \"Battle of Nanticoke\", where in 1813 the &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%20County%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; volunteer militia routed a band of American marauders who had been pillaging area farms and terrorizing the country, an exploit that inspired the British military forces and the people of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Canada\"&gt;Upper Canada&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;. The site was designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada\"&gt;National Historic Site of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 1924.\n&lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Hydro\"&gt;Ontario Hydro&lt;/a&gt; revealed plans to build a 4,000\u00a0MW fossil-fuel generating station near &lt;a href=\"Long%20Point%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Long Point, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in 1967. Its current site was selected in Nanticoke, Ontario, because of the nearby harbour, the proximity of &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; coal supplies, and proximity to much of Ontario's population. The construction of the plant cost &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20dollar\"&gt;CAN$&lt;/a&gt;800 million and operations started in 1972. Eight pulverized coal-fired steam generators were built in phases between 1973 and 1978.\nBy 1981, the plant was consuming 35,000 tonnes of coal per day. Over the years, another $900 million has been invested in making the plant more &lt;a href=\"Efficient%20energy%20use\"&gt;energy efficient&lt;/a&gt;, robust, and improving its emissions.\nPlant operations.\nPower generation and distribution.\nAt full capacity (4000\u00a0MW) with all eight generating units functioning, the station's annual electricity production had been as high as 24 billion kilowatt-hours (&lt;a href=\"kWh\"&gt;kWh&lt;/a&gt;), enough electricity to run nearly 2.5 million households. Although the plant houses eight generating units, four of those units have since been retired. (Two were retired in 2010, and two were retired in 2011.) The remaining four units are not in operation.\nPreviously, power generation at this plant was on a stand-by basis, only operating during peak levels of energy consumption, or when other generating facilities are unavailable. At other times the plant would remain idle. When demand for electricity was high, the remaining four active generating units were put into service, with the maximum potential to produce approximately 5% of Ontario's total generating capacity. (1880\u00a0MW out of the 34,079\u00a0MW of existing power generation in the province as of January 2012.) The plant is connected to the power grid by numerous 230,000- and 500,000-&lt;a href=\"volt\"&gt;volt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Overhead%20power%20line\"&gt;transmission lines&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cooling%20water\"&gt;Cooling water&lt;/a&gt; for the plant was drawn from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; using two pipes that are 6.5\u00a0m in &lt;a href=\"diameter\"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt;, stretch 550\u00a0m offshore, and sit 10\u00a0m below the surface. The plant had two multi-flue smokestacks which were both 198\u00a0m (650\u00a0ft) tall. A dock on the shore of the site allows ships to deliver coal to an on-site stock pile, which can hold up to 4.5 megatonnes.\nAt its peak, Nanticoke employed approximately 634 staff from the &lt;a href=\"Haldimand%E2%80%94Norfolk\"&gt;Haldimand\u2014Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; area.\nEmissions.\nThe Nanticoke station used to be one of Canada's largest &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas\"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emitters and polluters. In 2001, it was the largest single source of greenhouse gases according to &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Canada\"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Due to major reductions in output since 2009, it was eventually surpassed by facilities in &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecommissioning.\nThe Government of Ontario had originally targeted to phase out all of its coal plants by 2009, but abandoned this target in 2006 to the ire of organizations representing nurses and physicians, community groups and environment groups. The province could not replace Nanticoke's energy output by the deadline, despite Units 3 and 4 at Bruce \"A\" being brought back online between 2003 and 2004. The province was examining replacing this output using &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; by refurbishing its existing fleet, and building two additional reactors at the &lt;a href=\"Darlington%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station\"&gt;Darlington Nuclear Generating Station&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Power\"&gt;Bruce Power&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's only private nuclear power company, also proposed building two reactors on former &lt;a href=\"Stelco\"&gt;Stelco&lt;/a&gt; lands in Nanticoke. However, this was met with immediate opposition and dismissal from the government. \"It's a speculative move on the part of a private company...It doesn't enjoy the support, encouragement [or] approval...of the Government of Ontario,\" stated &lt;a href=\"George%20Smitherman\"&gt;George Smitherman&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. Bruce Power did however move ahead with the refurbishment of \"A\" Units 1 and 2 in 2005 and Ontario Power Generation commenced refurbishment of Darlington in 2016.\nTwo units at Nanticoke were shut down in fall 2010. Another two were shut down in 2011. The final four were shut down on December 31, 2013. This was made possible, in part, by the reactivation of Units 1 and 2 at Bruce Nuclear Generating Station the previous year. In July 2015, Ontario Power Generation announced it will no longer \"preserve and staff Nanticoke\", and the expectation is that the plant will be permanently decommissioned. Its two smokestacks were imploded using controlled demolition on February 28, 2018. The last sections were demolished on August 22, 2019."
