    "text": "Biofiltration is a &lt;a href=\"pollution%20control\"&gt;pollution control&lt;/a&gt; technique using a &lt;a href=\"bioreactor\"&gt;bioreactor&lt;/a&gt; containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Common uses include processing &lt;a href=\"waste%20water\"&gt;waste water&lt;/a&gt;, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from &lt;a href=\"surface%20runoff\"&gt;surface runoff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Microbiology\"&gt;microbiotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oxidation\"&gt;oxidation&lt;/a&gt; of contaminants in air.\nExamples of biofiltration.\nExamples of biofiltration include:\nControl of air pollution.\nWhen applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove &lt;a href=\"air%20pollution\"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin &lt;a href=\"biofilm\"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt; on the surface of the packing material. &lt;a href=\"Microorganism\"&gt;Microorganism&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters.\nThe technology finds the greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and water-soluble &lt;a href=\"volatile%20organic%20compounds\"&gt;volatile organic compounds&lt;/a&gt; (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from &lt;a href=\"wastewater\"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; treatment facilities, &lt;a href=\"pharmaceutical\"&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt;s, wood products manufacturing, &lt;a href=\"paint\"&gt;paint&lt;/a&gt; and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; compounds, including &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20sulfide\"&gt;hydrogen sulfide&lt;/a&gt;. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required\u2014a large biofilter (&gt;200,000 &lt;a href=\"acfm\"&gt;acfm&lt;/a&gt;) may occupy as much or more land than a football field\u2014this has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Since the early 1990s, engineered biofilters have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type.\nOne of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bio scrubber, or bio trickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic, and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. Several companies offer these types of proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.\nAlthough widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio-oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature. For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of &lt;a href=\"incineration\"&gt;incineration&lt;/a&gt; where additional CO2 and NOx are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high &lt;a href=\"biochemical%20oxygen%20demand\"&gt;biochemical oxygen demand&lt;/a&gt; (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this \"blowdown water\", necessary for proper maintenance of any bio-oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal &lt;a href=\"publicly%20owned%20treatment%20works\"&gt;publicly owned treatment works&lt;/a&gt; without any pretreatment.\nBiofilters are being utilized in &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Falls%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Columbia Falls, Montana&lt;/a&gt; at Plum Creek Timber Company's &lt;a href=\"fiberboard\"&gt;fiberboard&lt;/a&gt; plant. The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly).\nWater treatment.\nBiofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water. Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in &lt;a href=\"wastewater%20treatment\"&gt;wastewater treatment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"greywater\"&gt;greywater&lt;/a&gt; recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing &lt;a href=\"water%20quality\"&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiofiltration process.\nA biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called &lt;a href=\"biofilm\"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt;. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed\u2013film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms (&lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yeast\"&gt;yeast&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), macro-organisms (&lt;a href=\"protozoa\"&gt;protozoa&lt;/a&gt;, worms, insect's larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the &lt;a href=\"biofilm\"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt; is usually slimy and muddy.\nWater to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter):\nOrganic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by &lt;a href=\"biodegradation\"&gt;biodegradation&lt;/a&gt;. Biofiltration processes are usually &lt;a href=\"Cellular%20respiration%23Aerobic%20respiration\"&gt;aerobic&lt;/a&gt;, which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.\nMicroorganisms' activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc.\nTypes of filtering media.\nMost biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings.\nAdvantages.\nAlthough biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology are complex and variable. These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc.\nThe structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988):\nDrawbacks.\nBecause filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to &lt;a href=\"bioclogging\"&gt;bioclogging&lt;/a&gt; and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow whenever possible. Chemicals such as oxidizing (&lt;a href=\"peroxide\"&gt;peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ozone\"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt;) or biocide agents can also be used.\nDrinking water.\nFor drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.\nWastewater.\nBiofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the &lt;a href=\"agricultural%20wastewater%20treatment\"&gt;treatment of animal wastes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"landfill\"&gt;landfill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"leachate\"&gt;leachate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dairy%20wastewater\"&gt;dairy wastewater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"domestic%20wastewater\"&gt;domestic wastewater&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis process is versatile as it can be adapted to small flows (&lt; 1 m3/d), such as onsite &lt;a href=\"sewage\"&gt;sewage&lt;/a&gt; as well as to flows generated by a municipality (&gt; 240 000 m3/d). For decentralized domestic wastewater production, such as for isolated dwellings, it has been demonstrated that there are important daily, weekly and yearly fluctuations of hydraulic and organic production rates related to modern families' lifestyle. In this context, a biofilter located after a septic tank constitutes a robust process able to sustain the variability observed without compromising the treatment performance.\nUse in aquaculture.\nThe use of biofilters is common in closed &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; systems, such as &lt;a href=\"recirculating%20aquaculture%20systems\"&gt;recirculating aquaculture systems&lt;/a&gt; (RAS). Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting &lt;a href=\"ammonia\"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"nitrate\"&gt;nitrate&lt;/a&gt;. Ammonia (NH4+ and NH3) originates from the brachial &lt;a href=\"excretion\"&gt;excretion&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"gill\"&gt;gill&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20animal\"&gt;aquatic animal&lt;/a&gt;s and from the &lt;a href=\"decomposition\"&gt;decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of organic matter. As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by \"&lt;a href=\"Nitrosomonas\"&gt;Nitrosomonas&lt;/a&gt;\" sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by \"&lt;a href=\"Nitrobacter\"&gt;Nitrobacter&lt;/a&gt;\" sp.). This \"nitrification\" process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash. Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H+, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as &lt;a href=\"Lime%20%28material%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;."
