Vaughan said that while reciting a poem at infant school in Wellington he first experienced the applause and admiration coming from a good performance. From the age of seven he lived in &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire\"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended &lt;a href=\"Uttoxeter%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Uttoxeter Grammar School&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter leaving school, Vaughan joined &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;the Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Repertory%20theatre\"&gt;Repertory Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, and gained experience in other repertory theatres as well, before &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; service during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;.
