    "text": "Sigrid On\u00e9gin (June 1, 1889 \u2013 June 16, 1943) was a Franco-German &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"contralto\"&gt;contralto&lt;/a&gt; who enjoyed a major international career prior to World War II. She was celebrated for the richness of its tone, its flexibility, its size, and its expert coloratura technique. She also possessed a remarkably wide vocal range.\nBiography.\nShe was born in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden, in 1889 to a German father and a French mother. This renowned contralto first sang professionally under her maiden name, Lilly Hoffmann. She made her first public appearance, under the name Lilly Hoffmann, in Wiesbaden, Sept. 16, 1911, in a recital. She was accompanied on that occasion by a Russian pianist and composer, Baron Eugene Borisovitch Lvov On\u00e9gin (b. St. Petersburg, Oct. 10, 1883; d. Stuttgart, Nov. 12, 1919), a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, pianist and composer. He had adopted the surname of Pushkin\u2019s celebrated hero, On\u00e9gin; his real name was 'Lvov', and he was a grandnephew of Alexis Lvov, composer of the Russian Czarist hymn. Hoffmann and On\u00e9gin married in London on May 25, 1912, after which she sang briefly as Lilly Hoffmann-On\u00e9gin before settling on Sigrid On\u00e9gin, the name by which she became famous.\nShe studied in Frankfurt, Munich, and Milan, and also took lessons from famous singers of an earlier generation in &lt;a href=\"Lilli%20Lehmann\"&gt;Lilli Lehmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margarethe%20Siems\"&gt;Margarethe Siems&lt;/a&gt;. Her operatic debut occurred at &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; in October 1912, where she appeared as \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\". She joined the &lt;a href=\"Staatsoper%20Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1912 and the Munich Opera in 1919. After her first husband\u2019s early death in 1919, she married a second time in 1920 to Dr Fritz Penzoldt, who would later write her biography.\nIn the 1920s, she spent two seasons at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; and one at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%2C%20London\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, singing Amneris (\"&lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt;\") as well as a variety of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagnerian&lt;/a&gt; roles. In the 1930s, she sang at &lt;a href=\"Salzburg%20Festival\"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bayreuth%20Festival\"&gt;Bayreuth Festival&lt;/a&gt;, but she was most widely sought after for her concert performances.\nHer last concert appearance came in the United States in 1938. She died at &lt;a href=\"Magliaso\"&gt;Magliaso&lt;/a&gt;, in neutral Switzerland in 1943, while the Second World War was raging at its height. She made a number of impressive 78-rpm recordings during the years of her prime which have been re-issued on CD."
