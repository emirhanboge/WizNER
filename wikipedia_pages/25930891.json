He played linebacker and nose tackle at &lt;a href=\"Villanova%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Villanova University&lt;/a&gt;. During his senior year, he was a team captain and earned all-star honors. He graduated in 1977 with a degree in political science, specializing in international relations.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating, Mack became Villanova's defensive line and special teams coach. He then spent three years as a scout for BLESTO Scouting Combine, which represented the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Lions\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Colts\"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;.\nMack's first experience in the CFL came in 1984 as the director of player personnel for the Blue Bombers. During his tenure in Winnipeg he supplied players for head coaches &lt;a href=\"Cal%20Murphy\"&gt;Cal Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Riley%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Mike Riley&lt;/a&gt;. The Blue Bombers won their first &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup\"&gt;Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 22 years in 1984 and had an overall record of 46-21-1 during Mack's tenure there.\nMack left Winnipeg in 1987 to become a pro scout for the NFL's &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Falcons\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, he moved to the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Redskins\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; to become the team's director of pro scouting and was a member of the Redskins front office when the team won &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XXVI\"&gt;Super Bowl XXVI&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the dismissal of general manager &lt;a href=\"Kavis%20Reed\"&gt;Kavis Reed&lt;/a&gt; on July 14, 2019 the Alouettes expanded Mack's role alongside head coach &lt;a href=\"Khari%20Jones\"&gt;Khari Jones&lt;/a&gt; and director of football operations Patrick Donovan to fill the responsibilities left by the vacant general manager position.\nPersonal.\nMack resides in &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; with his wife, Kathleen.
