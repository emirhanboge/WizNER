    "text": "Chimor (also Kingdom of Chimor or Chim\u00fa Empire) was the political grouping of the Chim\u00fa culture. The culture arose about 900 AD, succeeding the &lt;a href=\"Moche%20culture\"&gt;Moche culture&lt;/a&gt;, and was later conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Inca emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Topa%20Inca%20Yupanqui\"&gt;Topa Inca Yupanqui&lt;/a&gt; around 1470, fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Chimor () was the largest kingdom in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Intermediate%20Period\"&gt;Late Intermediate Period&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) of coastline.\nThe first valleys seem to have joined forces willingly, but the &lt;a href=\"Sican%20culture\"&gt;Sican culture&lt;/a&gt; was acquired through conquest. They also were significantly influenced by the pre-Incan &lt;a href=\"Cajamarca%20culture\"&gt;Cajamarca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wari%20culture\"&gt;Wari culture&lt;/a&gt;s. According to legend, its capital of Chan Chan was founded by &lt;a href=\"Taycanamo\"&gt;Taycanamo&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived in the area by sea. Chimor was the last kingdom that had any chance of stopping the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Inca Empire&lt;/a&gt;. But the Inca conquest began in the 1470s by &lt;a href=\"Topa%20Inca%20Yupanqui\"&gt;Topa Inca Yupanqui&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the emperor and descendant of Tacaynamo, Minchancaman, and was nearly complete when &lt;a href=\"Huayna%20Capac\"&gt;Huayna Capac&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne in 1493.\nThe Chim\u00fa resided on a strip of desert on the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. The rivers in the region carved a series of fertile valley plains, which were very flat and well-suited to irrigation. Agriculture and fishing were both very important to the Chim\u00fa economy.\nWorshipping the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, the Chim\u00fa, unlike the Inca, considered it more powerful than the &lt;a href=\"solar%20deity\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;. Offerings played an important role in religious rites. A common object for offerings, as well as one used by artisans, was the shell of the \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shellfish, which resides only in the warm coastal waters off present-day &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. Associated with the sea, rainfall, and fertility, \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shells were highly valued and traded by the Chim\u00fa people, and the exchange of the shells played a significant economic and political role in the empire.\nThe Chim\u00fa people are best known for their distinctive monochromatic pottery and fine metal working of &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"tumbaga\"&gt;tumbaga&lt;/a&gt;\" (copper and gold). The pottery is often in the shape of a creature or has a human figure sitting or standing on a &lt;a href=\"cuboid\"&gt;cuboid&lt;/a&gt; bottle. The shiny black finish of most Chim\u00fa pottery was achieved by firing the pottery at high temperatures in a closed &lt;a href=\"kiln\"&gt;kiln&lt;/a&gt;, which prevented &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; from reacting with the &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly Chim\u00fa (Moche civilization).\nThe oldest civilization present on the north coast of &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; is the Moche or Mochica civilization, which is identified as Early Chim\u00fa. The start of this period is not known for certain, but it ended around 700 AD. It was centered in the &lt;a href=\"Chicama%20Valley\"&gt;Chicama&lt;/a&gt;, Moche, and &lt;a href=\"Viru%20Valley\"&gt;Viru Valley&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Many large pyramids are attributed to the Early Chim\u00fa period.\" (37) These pyramids are built of &lt;a href=\"adobe\"&gt;adobe&lt;/a&gt; in rectangular shapes made from molds. \"Early Chim\u00fa cemeteries are also found without pyramid associations. Burials are usually in extended positions, in prepared tombs. The rectangular, adobe-lined and covered tombs have niches in their walls in which bowls were placed.\" (39) \nThe Early pottery is also characterized by realistic modeling and painted scenes.\nExpansion and rule.\nExpansion.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Wari%20Empire\"&gt;Wari Empire&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, the mature Chim\u00fa culture developed in roughly the same territory where the Mochica had existed centuries before. The Chim\u00fa was also a coastal culture - according to legend, its capital of &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Chan\"&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt; was founded by Taycanamo, who arrived in the area by sea. It was developed in the Moche Valley north of present-day Lima, northeast of &lt;a href=\"Huarmey\"&gt;Huarmey&lt;/a&gt;, and finishing in central present-day Trujillo. Later, it expanded to &lt;a href=\"Arequipa\"&gt;Arequipa&lt;/a&gt;. During this time Arequipa was framed by 3 volcanoes. (39)\nThe Chim\u00fa appeared in the year 900: Chimor, also known as the Kingdom of Chimor, had its capital \"at the great site now called Chanchan, between Trujillo and the sea, and we may assume that Taycanamo founded his kingdom there. His son, Guacri-caur, conquered the lower part of the valley and was succeeded by a son named Nancen-pinco who really laid the foundations of the Kingdom by conquering the head of the valley of Chimor and the neighboring valleys of Sana, Pacasmayo, Chicama, Viru, Chao and Santa.\"\nThe estimated founding date of the last Chim\u00fa kingdom is in the first half of the fourteenth century. Nacen-pinco was believed to have ruled around 1370 and was followed by seven rulers whose names are not yet known. Minchancaman followed these rulers, and was ruling around the time of the Inca conquest (between 1462 and 1470). This great expansion is believed to have occurred during the late period of Chim\u00fa civilization, called: Late Chim\u00fa, but the development of the Chim\u00fa territory spanned a number of phases and more than a single generation. Nacen-pinco, \"may have pushed the imperial frontiers to Jequetepeque and to Santa, but conquest of the entire region was an agglutinative process initiated by earlier rulers.\" (17)\nThe Chim\u00fa expanded to include a vast area and many different ethnic groups. The first valleys seem to have joined forces willingly, but the &lt;a href=\"Sican%20culture\"&gt;Sican culture&lt;/a&gt; was assimilated through conquest. At its peak, the Chim\u00fa advanced to the limits of the desert coast to the valley of the &lt;a href=\"Jequetepeque%20River\"&gt;Jequetepeque River&lt;/a&gt; in the north. &lt;a href=\"Pampa%20Grande\"&gt;Pampa Grande&lt;/a&gt; in the Lambayeque Valley was also ruled by the Chim\u00fa.\nTo the south, they expanded as far as Carabayllo. Their expansion southward was stopped by the military power of the great valley of &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;. Historians and archeologists contest how far south they managed to expand.\nRule.\nThe Chim\u00fa society was a four-level &lt;a href=\"hierarchical\"&gt;hierarchical&lt;/a&gt; system, with a powerful elite rule over administrative centers. The hierarchy was centered at the walled cities, called \"ciudadelas\", at &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Chan\"&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt;. The political power at Chan Chan is demonstrated by the organization of labor to construct the Chim\u00fa's &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;s and irrigated fields.\nChan Chan was the top of the Chimu hierarchy, with Farf\u00e1n in the Jequetepeque Valley as a subordinate. This organization, which was quickly established during the conquest of the Jequetepeque Valley, suggests the Chim\u00fa established the hierarchy during the early stages of their expansion. The existing elite at peripheral locations, such as the Jequetepeque Valley and other centers of power, were incorporated into the Chim\u00fa government on lower levels of the hierarchy. These lower-order centers managed land, water, and labor, while the higher-order centers either moved the resources to Chan Chan or carried out other administrative decisions. Rural sites were used as engineering headquarters, while the canals were being built; later they operated as maintenance sites. The numerous broken bowls found at \"&lt;a href=\"Quebrada%20del%20Oso\"&gt;Quebrada del Oso&lt;/a&gt;\" support this theory, as the bowls were probably used to feed the large workforce that built and maintained that section of canal. The workers were probably fed and housed at state expense.\nDownfall.\nThe state governed such social classes until the empire of the &lt;a href=\"Sican%20culture\"&gt;Sican culture&lt;/a&gt; conquered the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lambayeque%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Lambayeque, Peru&lt;/a&gt;. The legends of war were said to have been told by the leaders &lt;a href=\"Naylamp\"&gt;Naylamp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sican%20language\"&gt;Sican language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tacayanamo\"&gt;Tacayanamo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chim%C3%BA%20language\"&gt;Chim\u00fa&lt;/a&gt;. The people paid tribute to the rulers with products or labor. \nChimor was the last Andean kingdom capable of stopping the Inca Empire, but the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20society\"&gt;Inca&lt;/a&gt; conquest began in the 1470s by &lt;a href=\"Topa%20Inca%20Yupanqui\"&gt;Topa Inca Yupanqui&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the emperor Minchancaman, and was nearly complete when &lt;a href=\"Huayna%20Capac\"&gt;Huayna Capac&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne in 1493. They moved &lt;a href=\"Minchancaman\"&gt;Minchancaman&lt;/a&gt;, the final Chim\u00fa emperor, to &lt;a href=\"Cusco\"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt; and redirected gold and silver there to adorn the &lt;a href=\"Qurikancha\"&gt;Qurikancha&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nChan Chan could be said to have developed a &lt;a href=\"bureaucracy\"&gt;bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt; due to the elite's controlled access to information. The economic and social system operated through the import of raw materials, where they were processed into prestige goods by artisans at Chan Chan. The elite at Chan Chan made the decisions on most other matters concerning organization, monopolizing production, storage of food and products, and distribution or consumption of goods.\nThe majority of the citizens in each \"ciudadela\" were artisans. In the late Chim\u00fa, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped in the \"ciudadela\" according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic increase in Chim\u00fa craft production, and they believe that artisans may have been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken as a result of Chim\u00fa conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork and &lt;a href=\"weaving\"&gt;weaving&lt;/a&gt; in the same domestic unit, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, and metallurgy, and made ceramics and textiles from cotton and the wool of &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alpaca\"&gt;alpaca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"vicu%C3%B1a\"&gt;vicu\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;. People used reed fishing canoes (displayed in the image on the right), hunted, and traded using bronze coins.\nSubsistence and agriculture.\nThe Chim\u00fa developed mainly through intensive farming techniques and hydraulic work, which joined valleys to form complexes, such as the Chicama-Moche complex, which was a combination of two valleys in La Libertad. The Lambayeque linked the valleys of La Leche, Lambayeque, Reque, and Sa\u00f1a Jequetepeque. They developed an excellent agricultural techniques which expanded the strength of their cultivated areas. \"Huachaques\" were sunken farms where land was withdrawn to work the moist, sandy soil underneath, an example of which is Tschudi.\nThe Chim\u00fa used walk-in wells, similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"Nazca\"&gt;Nazca&lt;/a&gt;, to draw water, and reservoirs to contain the water from rivers. This system increased the productivity of the land, which increased Chim\u00fa wealth, and likely contributed to the formation of a bureaucratic system. The Chim\u00fa cultivated beans, sweet potato, papaya, and cotton with their reservoir and irrigation system. This focus on large-scale irrigation persisted until the Late Intermediate period. At this point, there was a shift to a more specialized system that focused on importing and redistributing resources from satellite communities. There appears to have been a complex network of sites that provided goods and services for Chim\u00fa subsistence. Many of these sites produced commodities that the Chim\u00fa could not.\nMany sites relied on marine resources, but after the advent of agriculture, there were more sites further inland, where marine resources were harder to attain. Keeping &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s arose as a supplemental way of attaining meat, but by the Late Intermediate period and Late Horizon, inland sites used &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s as a main resource, although they maintained contact with coastal sites to use supplemental marine resources. They also made masks.\nTechnology.\nOne of the earliest known examples of distance communication is a Chim\u00fa device consisting of two resin-coated gourds connected by a 75-foot length of twine. Only one example has been found, and nothing is known about its originator or use.\nSplit inheritance.\nThe Chimu capital, Chan Chan, had a series of elite residential compounds or cuidadelas that were not occupied simultaneously, but sequentially. The reason for this is that Chimu rulers practiced split inheritance, which dictated that the heir to the throne had to build his own palace. After the death of a ruler, all the ruler's wealth would be distributed to more distant relatives.\nVisual arts.\nShell.\nThe Chim\u00fa people highly valued mollusk shell for its economic and political significance as a luxury good traded over long distances, and the shell was often viewed as a symbol of elite status and divine power. Using shell as a medium for their art and artifacts, the Chim\u00fa frequently employed the shell of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\", a type of marine bivalve mollusk.\nThe most abundant \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" species present in &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; are \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus%20calcifer\"&gt;Spondylus calcifer&lt;/a&gt;\" Carpenter and \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus%20princeps\"&gt;Spondylus princeps&lt;/a&gt;\" Broderip. \"Spondylus calcifer\" has red and white hues, primarily used for beads and artifacts. While this species resides in shallower waters and is easier to obtain, the \"Spondylus princeps\", known as the \u201cthorny oyster\u201d for its characteristic spines, is a solid red color and can only be harvested by experienced divers. Thus, this shell is more highly desired and traded by the Chim\u00fa people.\nUses and symbolism.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shell had a wide variety of uses in Andean culture and took a variety of forms, ranging from whole shells to fragments to ground shell powder. This material was worked to create intricately carved ornaments, tools, and goods reserved for the nobles and deities. Shell fragments have been found as inlays for body ornaments and as beads for pieces of jewelry. The image to the right displays a Chim\u00fa collar made of cotton, red \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shell beads, and black stone beads, and the image below displays a sling shot made of shell. Representing wealth and power, the shell was ground into powder and spread out before the Chimor king by an official called the Fonga Sigde, forming a \u201cred carpet\u201d for the ruler as he walked. Shell were likewise used for ornamentation of certain buildings and architectural structures.\nFound in the tombs of nobles, these artifacts were often used as burial goods and played a role in sacrificial practices. Due to its aquatic origins, shells were prized for their connection to the sea and role in water and fertility rituals, used as offerings in agricultural fields to promote abundant crop yields. The Chim\u00fa also placed shells in sources of water, such as wells and springs, to bring rain to their fields, especially in times of drought.\nThe symbolic significance of the \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shell is closely related to the physical attributes and biological properties of the bivalve. Its characteristic morphology contributed to the association of the shell with divine power and the supernatural world. The external spines of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" lend to the shell its ties to strength and protection. Because of its shape and red blood-like color, the shell often represents death, sacrifice, and ritual bloodletting practices, as well as female reproductive body parts. Known as the \"daughter of the sea,\" the \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shell has also been linked to femininity, with the univalve embodying masculinity.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" has specialized sensory organs, in particular sensitive eyes and papillae, that Andean cultures associate with extra sensory protection. Sensitive to temperature changes in water and thriving in warmer waters, the shell was thought to have divinatory powers, and because its migratory patterns are related to &lt;a href=\"El%20Ni%C3%B1o\"&gt;El Ni\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; conditions, its presence is seen as an omen for disaster.\nMoreover, \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" exhibits seasonal toxicity, known as &lt;a href=\"Paralytic%20shellfish%20poisoning\"&gt;Paralytic shellfish poisoning&lt;/a&gt; (PSP). Twice a year, the mollusk tissue contains substances that are toxic to humans, caused by poisonous algae that the mollusks consume. During these months, the shells are offered to weather and fertility deities as \u201cfood for the gods\u201d, as it was thought that only deities were powerful enough to eat the flesh of the bivalve. At tolerable levels, human consumption of this toxic flesh may result in muscle weakness, mind-altering states, and euphoria, but in more concentrated doses, may lead to paralysis and death. Because of these hallucinogenic effects, \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" was a symbol of spiritual transcendence and was viewed as bridge between physical and supernatural worlds.\nDiving.\nThough the remains of shell workshops and artifacts are abundant in Chimor, the \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shell originates in the warm waters of &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. Harvesting the shell is both a time and labor-intensive process, requiring experienced divers to free dive to depths of up to 50 meters and pry the shells off of rocks.\nThe difficult task of shell diving is captured in the imagery of many portable Andean artifacts, such as bowls, earspools, and textiles. Many of these images are similar, illustrating a boat with sailors holding cords attached to the divers in the water. Stone weights are suspended from the divers as they gather shells, and portrayals of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" often emphasize their characteristic spines. The image to the right features a Chim\u00fa earspool, which was molded from gold-copper and silver alloys and depicts a shell diving scene. The rectangle in the upper half of the earspool is a boat with large sails, and birds reside at the top of the piece. Four divers swim beneath the boat and are near spiky eggshell-shaped shells.\nSections of \"ciudadelas\", large compounds often reserved for the kings and elite individuals, were used as storage areas for shell artifacts, and the architecture and ornamentation of these structures symbolize the treasures of the sea. Los \"Buceadores\" (the Divers), a relief in &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Chan\"&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt; in Ciudadela Uhle, displays imagery of a pair of figures in a tule boat, one of whom holds a paddle, and another pair of shell divers beneath the boat and connected to ropes. The relief also features a net-like semicircle, as well as spiny figures that represent shells.\nProduction and trade.\nMuch of the existing evidence for shell-working in the Andes stems from archaeological findings and colonial texts. \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" is abundant in sites across Peru, discovered in burial sites and with the remains of shell workshops. The high level of uniformity in these shell objects, combined with the technical nature of shell-working, indicate that \"Spondylus\" production was domestic and carried out by independent craftsmen. Many collections of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" artifacts contain objects from various stages of shell production: whole shells, fragments, worked pieces, and debris from shell reduction. Though researchers have uncovered worked shell debris and ample proof for the presence of shell workshops, they have only identified and discussed very few specific shell workshops. One workshop, which was thought to be maintained by the Chim\u00fa people, was identified at &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BAcume\"&gt;T\u00facume&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lambayeque%20Region\"&gt;Lambayeque Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; by archaeologist and researcher Daniel Sandweiss. Dating back to around 1390-1480 A.D., the workshop comprised various small rooms and contained evidence for the production of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" beads. Shell debris from all stages of production, ranging from cut pieces to finished beads, along with the stone tools used to work the shell, were excavated from the site.\nWhile many archaeological sources point to the abundance of shell-working, as the remains of shell workshops and artifacts were uncovered widely in Peru, little evidence documents the movement of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" from its source in Ecuador to workshops in &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Chan\"&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt;. The archaeological record indicates that Chimor was an important center for the exchange of trade, and shell often traveled long distances from its geographic source to reach the empire of Chimor. The trade of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" was integral to the expanding political power and economy of the Chim\u00fa. The shell was viewed as an exotic material, and the Chimor control of the exchange of the imported luxury good served as a means of political control, establishing and legitimizing the rule of the nobles. Unlike the Inca Empire, the Chim\u00fa did not attempt to expand its command of the \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" trade through imperial conquests of neighboring states, but rather, used its existing access to the trade as a religious and financial justification for power.\nLittle information exists about the means by which \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" was acquired and exchanged along trade routes, and many scholars have proposed various models for \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" movement. The marine bivalve was likely traded either through independent merchants or state-administered long-distance trade, with a north-south movement of the items. One of the first accounts of exchange of \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" is a report written by Spanish colonist &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Xerez\"&gt;Francisco Xerez&lt;/a&gt;, who was a member of the expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Pizarro\"&gt;Francisco Pizarro&lt;/a&gt;, and describes a raft of luxury goods, such as textiles, emeralds, and gold and silver objects, which were to be traded for \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shells.\nResearchers likewise disagree on the transportation methods of shells and whether they were exported via sea or land. Imagery in Andean pottery and reliefs depict llama caravans carrying shell, providing evidence that the transportation of shell was at least in part overland.\nTextiles.\nSpinning is the practice of combining a small set of threads to achieve a long and continuous thread with the use of an instrument called a &lt;a href=\"spindle%20%28textiles%29\"&gt;spindle&lt;/a&gt;. The \"zone\" is an instrument made of a small wand that usually gets thinner at both ends; that was used alongside a \"tortera\" or \"piruro\". The spindle is inserted into the bottom to make a counterweight. It starts spinning, taking the \"rueca\" (where the fiber was set to be spun). Fibers that are laid down in the zone are quickly turned between the thumb and index fingers and twisted to interlock the fibers, creating a long thread. After the desired lengths of threads are attained, the threads are intersected and woven in various combinations to make fabrics.\nThe Chim\u00fa embellished their fabrics with &lt;a href=\"brocades\"&gt;brocades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"embroidery\"&gt;embroidery&lt;/a&gt;, fabrics doubles, and painted fabrics. Sometimes textiles were adorned with feathers and gold or silver plates. Tropical feathers used in such textiles are evidence of long-distance trade. Colored dyes were created from plants containing &lt;a href=\"tannin\"&gt;tannin&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"mole%20%28animal%29\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt;\", or &lt;a href=\"walnut\"&gt;walnut&lt;/a&gt;; and minerals, such as &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, ferruginosa, or mordant aluminum; as well as from animals, such as &lt;a href=\"cochineal\"&gt;cochineal&lt;/a&gt;. The garments were made of the wool of four animals: the &lt;a href=\"guanaco\"&gt;guanaco&lt;/a&gt;, llama, alpaca, and vicuna. The people also used varieties of cotton, that grows naturally in seven different colors. The clothing consisted of the Chim\u00fa loincloth, sleeveless shirts with or without fringes, small ponchos, and tunics.\nThe majority of Chim\u00fa textiles were made from &lt;a href=\"Alpaca_fiber\"&gt;alpaca wool&lt;/a&gt; and cotton. Judging from the uniform spin direction, degree of the twist, and colors of the threads, it is likely that all of the fibers were pre-spun and imported from a single location.\nCeramics.\nThe civilisation is known for its exquisite and intricate metalworking, one of the most advanced of the pre-Columbian era. Chim\u00fa ceramics were crafted for two functions: containers for daily domestic use and those made for ceremonial use for offerings at burials. Domestic pottery was developed without higher finishing, while funeral ceramics show more aesthetic refinement.\nThe main features of Chim\u00fa ceramics were small sculptures, and manufacturing molded and shaped pottery for ceremonial or daily use. Ceramics were usually stained black, although there are some variations. Lighter ceramics were also produced in smaller quantities. The characteristic brightness was obtained by rubbing with a rock that previously had been polished. Many animals, fruits, characters, and mystical entities have been represented pictorially on Chim\u00fa ceramics. Archaeological evidence suggest that Chimor grew out of the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Moche%20culture\"&gt;Moche&lt;/a&gt;, as early Chim\u00fa pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate.\nMetallurgy.\nMetalworking picked up quickly in the Late Chim\u00fa periods. The Chim\u00fa worked with metals such as gold, silver, and copper. Some Chim\u00fa artisans worked in metal workshops divided into sections for each specialized treatment of metals: plating, gold, stamping, lost-wax, pearl, the watermark, and embossing wooden molds. These techniques produced large variety of objects, such as cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, and crowns. They used arsenic to harden the metals after they were cast. Large-scale smelting took place in a cluster of workshops at Cerro de los Cemetarios. The process starts with ore extracted from mines or a river, which is heated to very high temperatures and then cooled. The result is a group of prills, such as small round sections of copper, in a mass of slag, which are other materials which are not useful for metallurgy. The prills are then extracted by crushing the slag, and then melted together to form ingots, which were fashioned into various items. The Chim\u00fa also shaped metals through hammering, as displayed in the image on the right of the silver Chim\u00fa beaker. Chim\u00fa metalsmiths achieved this technique with simple tools and a single sheet of gold. The artist would first carve a wooden mold. Then they would carefully hammer the paper-thin sheet of gold around the wooden base.\nAlthough copper is found naturally on the coast, it was mostly attained from the highlands in an area about 3 days away. Since most of the copper was imported, it is likely that most of the metal objects that were made were likely very small. The pieces, such as wires, needles, digging stick points, tweezers, and personal ornaments, are consistently small, utilitarian objects of copper or copper bronze. The &lt;a href=\"Tumi\"&gt;Tumi&lt;/a&gt; is one well-known Chim\u00fa work. They also made beautiful ritual costumes of gold compounds with plume headdresses, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and breastplates.\nReligion.\nDeities\nIn Pacasmayo, the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; deity (Si or Shi) was the greatest divinity. It was believed to be more powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;, as it appeared by night and day, and it also controlled the weather and growth of crops. Devotees sacrificed animals and birds to the Moon, as well as their own children on piles of colored cottons with offerings of &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chicha\"&gt;chicha&lt;/a&gt;. They believed the sacrificed children would become deified and they were usually sacrificed around age five.The Chim\u00fa worshipped Mars (Nor) and Earth (Ghisa) deities, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; (Jiang) and the &lt;a href=\"Sea\"&gt;Sea&lt;/a&gt; (Ni) deities. Jiang was associated with stones called alaec-pong (cacique stone), which were believed to be ancestors of the people in whose area they stood and sons of the Sun. The Chim\u00fa made offerings of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; flour of red &lt;a href=\"ochre\"&gt;ochre&lt;/a&gt; to Ni for protection against drowning and bountiful catches of fish.\nSeveral constellations were also viewed as important. Two of the stars of &lt;a href=\"Orion%27s%20Belt\"&gt;Orion's Belt&lt;/a&gt; were considered to be the emissaries of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. The constellation Fur (the &lt;a href=\"Pleiades\"&gt;Pleiades&lt;/a&gt;) was used to calculate the year and was believed to watch over the crops.\nEach district had local shrines that varied in importance. These shrines, called \"&lt;a href=\"huacas\"&gt;huacas&lt;/a&gt;,\" were also found in other parts of &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, and had a sacred object of worship (\"macyaec\") with an associated legend and cult.\nSacrifice\nIn 1997, members of an archaeological team discovered approximately 200 skeletal remains on the beach at &lt;a href=\"Punta%20Lobos%2C%20Peru\"&gt;Punta Lobos, Peru&lt;/a&gt;. These figures were blindfolded and had their hands bound behind their backs, their feet bound together, and their throats slashed. Archaeologists suggest these figures, likely bodies of fishermen, may have been killed as a sign of gratitude to the sea god Ni after they conquered the fishermen's fertile seaside valley in 1350 A.D.\nTombs in the Huaca of the Moon belonged to six or seven teenagers from 13\u201314 years of age. Nine tombs belonged to children.\nIn 2011, archaeologists uncovered human and animal skeletons in the village of &lt;a href=\"Huanchaco\"&gt;Huanchaco&lt;/a&gt;. After years of excavation, they identified more than 140 human (and more than 200 &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;) skeletons from children between the ages of 6 and 15, all of whom had deep slashes across the sternum and broken rib cages indicating that their hearts may have been removed. According to \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Geographic\"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt;\", if the analysis is correct, the discovery constitutes \"the largest single mass &lt;a href=\"child%20sacrifice\"&gt;child sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; event known in world history\". The burial is dated at 1400-1450 A.D. Anthropologist Haagen Klaus speculates that Chim\u00fa might have turned to children when the sacrifice of adults was not enough to stop torrential rain and flooding caused by El Ni\u00f1o. In August 2019 the archaeological team working at this site revealed that the bodies of 227 victims, aged between four and 14, had been excavated, further establishing this as the largest-ever known example of child sacrifice.\nArchitecture.\nDifferential architecture of palaces and monumental sites distinguished the rulers from the common people. At &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Chan\"&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt;, there are ten large, walled enclosures called \"ciudadelas\", or royal compounds, thought to be associated with the kings of Chimor. They are surrounded by adobe walls that are nine meters high, giving the \"ciudadela\" the appearance of a fortress.\nThe bulk of the Chim\u00fa population (approximately 26,000 people) lived in \"barrios\" on the outer edge of the city. They consisted of many single-family domestic spaces with a kitchen, work space, domestic animals, and storage area.\n\"Ciudadelas\" frequently have U-shaped rooms that consist of three walls, a raised floor, and frequently, a courtyard, and there were often as many as 15 in one palace. In the early Chim\u00fa period, the U-shaped areas were found in strategic places for controlling the flow of supplies from storerooms, but it is unlikely that they served as storage areas. They are described as mnemonic devices for keeping track of the distribution of supplies. Over time, the frequency of the U-shaped structures increased, and the distribution of the structures changed, becoming more grouped, rather than dispersed, and occurring further away from access routes to resources.\nThe architecture of the rural sites also supported the idea of a hierarchical social order. They have similar structural components, making them mini-\"ciudadelas\" with rural adapted administrative functions. Most of these sites have smaller walls, with many \"audiencias\" as the focal point of the structures. These would be used to restrict access to certain areas and are often found at strategic points.\nChan Chan shows a lack of a unifying plan or a discernible pattern. The urban core contains six principal classes of architecture:"
