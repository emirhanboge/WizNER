    "text": "Edmond L. DePatie (27 January 1900 \u2013 6 August 1966) was an &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American film industry&lt;/a&gt; executive. He was vice president and general manager of &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; Burbank studio, and on 18 April, 1966 at the &lt;a href=\"38th%20Academy%20Awards\"&gt;38th Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, DePatie was honored with the &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Hersholt%20Humanitarian%20Award\"&gt;Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award&lt;/a&gt;, just four months before his death.\nHe succeeded Jean Hersholt as president of the &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Fund\"&gt;Motion Picture Relief Fund&lt;/a&gt; in 1955, later launching a campaign for the establishment of a Motion Picture Exposition and Hall of Fame to honor filmmaking and to bring in revenue for the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund Country House. These plans were not successful, and despite the efforts of many over the years, a Hollywood Museum that benefits the Country House has not become a reality.\nHe died of a heart attack while vacationing in &lt;a href=\"Chowchilla%2C%20California\"&gt;Chowchilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on 6 August 1966, aged 66."
