    "text": "The Moray Eels Eat the Space Needle is the second album by the American band &lt;a href=\"Space%20Needle%20%28band%29\"&gt;Space Needle&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1997. Its title is a tribute to a 1968 album by &lt;a href=\"the%20Holy%20Modal%20Rounders\"&gt;the Holy Modal Rounders&lt;/a&gt;. The album artwork is by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Dean%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Roger Dean&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"Whereas Space Needle genuinely broke new ground with the eerie, distortion-drenched sound collages of their debut, they now seem a bizarre parody of themselves, liberally mixing several of the most self-indulgent musical genres\u2014from free jazz to prog rock\u2014into one overlong, soporific outing.\" \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Austin%20Chronicle\"&gt;The Austin Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" thought that \"Space Needle just can't seem to make up their mind about whether they want to be cacophonous feedback pushers or subtle purveyors of sweet melody.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" deemed the album \"a handful of pretty 'lullabies' encased in an infinitely longer handful of space rock instrumentals.\""
