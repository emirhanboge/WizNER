    "text": "The Hoot (; \"Whale\") is an Iranian &lt;a href=\"supercavitation\"&gt;supercavitation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; claimed to travel at approximately , several times faster than a conventional torpedo. It was claimed to have been successfully test-fired from a surface ship against a dummy submarine during the Iranian military exercise \"Great Prophet\" () on 2 April 2006 and 3 April 2006. Iran test-fired the torpedo within its territorial waters in the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Hormuz\"&gt;Strait of Hormuz&lt;/a&gt; in May 2017.\nThe official Iranian news agency &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency\"&gt;IRNA&lt;/a&gt; claims the torpedo was produced and developed by the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Revolutionary%20Guard%20Corps\"&gt;Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&lt;/a&gt; (). Most military and industry analysts have concluded that the Hoot is &lt;a href=\"Reverse%20engineering%23Reverse%20engineering%20for%20military%20applications\"&gt;reverse engineered&lt;/a&gt; from the Russian &lt;a href=\"VA-111%20Shkval\"&gt;VA-111 Shkval&lt;/a&gt; supercavitation torpedo which travels at the same speed."
