    "text": "Oper\u00e1rio Futebol Clube Ltda., often known as Oper\u00e1rio FC or Oper\u00e1rio Ltda. is a Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team from &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1rzea%20Grande%2C%20Mato%20Grosso\"&gt;V\u00e1rzea Grande&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mato%20Grosso\"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;, founded on 8 August 2002. The club played in the &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20C\"&gt;Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C&lt;/a&gt; once, in 2006.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on 8 August 2002 in the place of &lt;a href=\"Esporte%20Clube%20Oper%C3%A1rio\"&gt;Esporte Clube Oper\u00e1rio&lt;/a&gt;, which was then founded in 1994 to replace dissolved side &lt;a href=\"CE%20Oper%C3%A1rio%20V%C3%A1rzea-Grandense\"&gt;CE Oper\u00e1rio V\u00e1rzea-Grandense&lt;/a&gt;. After inheriting \"ECO\"s place, the club played in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Copa%20do%20Brasil\"&gt;2003 Copa do Brasil&lt;/a&gt; and was knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras\"&gt;Palmeiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, Oper\u00e1rio lifted their first trophy by winning the year's &lt;a href=\"Copa%20FMF\"&gt;Copa FMF&lt;/a&gt;, after defeating &lt;a href=\"Mixto%20Esporte%20Clube\"&gt;Mixto&lt;/a&gt; in the finals. They also won the &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Mato-Grossense\"&gt;Campeonato Mato-Grossense&lt;/a&gt; in the following year, after defeating &lt;a href=\"Barra%20do%20Gar%C3%A7as%20Futebol%20Clube\"&gt;Barra do Gar\u00e7as&lt;/a&gt;, and played in the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20C\"&gt;Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2009, after the latter returned to an active status, a merger proposal was lifted, but the move did not materialize. In that year, Oper\u00e1rio FC played in the first division, while CEOV played in the second division. CEOV was again licensed in 2010, as Oper\u00e1rio finished second in that year's Matogrossense.\nBoth CEOV and Oper\u00e1rio FC faced each other in 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2019; both were playing in the second division in the first encounters, while the remaining ones all took part in the first division. In 2017, after being relegated to the second level, Oper\u00e1rio was sold through a social media.\nIn 2018, Oper\u00e1rio FC changed colours to differentiate from CEOV. In 2019, after being relegated from the first division, Oper\u00e1rio chose not to play in the 2020 second division.\nWomen's team.\nThe club's women's team took part in the 2020 &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20de%20Futebol%20Feminino%20S%C3%A9rie%20A2\"&gt;Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino S\u00e9rie A2&lt;/a&gt;, after winning the &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Mato-Grossense%20de%20Futebol%20Feminino\"&gt;Campeonato Mato-Grossense de Futebol Feminino&lt;/a&gt; in the previous year."
