    "title": "Milliradian",
    "text": "A milliradian (&lt;a href=\"International%20System%20of%20Units\"&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt;-symbol mrad, sometimes also abbreviated mil) is an &lt;a href=\"SI%20derived%20unit\"&gt;SI derived unit&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"angular%20measurement\"&gt;angular measurement&lt;/a&gt; which is defined as a thousandth of a &lt;a href=\"radian\"&gt;radian&lt;/a&gt; (0.001\u00a0radian). Milliradians are used in adjustment of &lt;a href=\"firearm\"&gt;firearm&lt;/a&gt; sights by adjusting the angle of the sight compared to the barrel (up, down, left, or right). Milliradians are also used for comparing &lt;a href=\"shot%20grouping\"&gt;shot grouping&lt;/a&gt;s, or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized &lt;a href=\"shooting%20target\"&gt;shooting target&lt;/a&gt;s at different distances. When using a scope with both mrad adjustment and a &lt;a href=\"reticle\"&gt;reticle&lt;/a&gt; with mrad markings (called an \"mrad/mrad scope\"), the shooter can use the reticle as a 'ruler' to count the number of mrads a shot was off-target, which directly translates to the sight adjustment needed to hit the target with a follow up shot. Optics with mrad markings in the reticle can also be used to make a &lt;a href=\"stadiametric%20rangefinding\"&gt;range estimation&lt;/a&gt; of a known size target, or vice versa, to determine a target size if the distance is known, a practice called \"milling\".\nMilliradians are generally used for very small angles, which allows for very accurate mathematical approximations to more easily calculate with &lt;a href=\"direct%20proportion\"&gt;direct proportion&lt;/a&gt;s, back and forth between the &lt;a href=\"angular%20distance\"&gt;angular separation&lt;/a&gt; observed in an optic, linear &lt;a href=\"subtension\"&gt;subtension&lt;/a&gt; on target, and range. In such applications it is useful to use a unit for target size that is a thousandth of the unit for range, for instance by using the metric units &lt;a href=\"millimeter\"&gt;millimeter&lt;/a&gt;s for target size and &lt;a href=\"meter\"&gt;meter&lt;/a&gt;s for range. This coincides with the definition of the milliradian where the arc length is defined as of the radius. A common adjustment value in firearm sights is 1\u00a0cm at 100\u00a0meters which equals = \u00a0mrad.\nThe true definition of a milliradian is based on a &lt;a href=\"unit%20circle\"&gt;unit circle&lt;/a&gt; with a radius of &lt;a href=\"1\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"arc%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;arc&lt;/a&gt; divided into 1,000\u00a0mrad per radian, hence 2,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"pi\"&gt;\u03c0&lt;/a&gt; or approximately 6,283.185\u00a0milliradians in one &lt;a href=\"turn%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt;, and rifle scope adjustments and reticles are calibrated to this definition. There are also other definitions used for &lt;a href=\"surveying\"&gt;land mapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; which are rounded to more easily be divided into smaller parts for use with &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;es, which are then often referred to as \"mils\", \"lines\", or similar. For instance there are artillery sights and compasses with 6,400\u00a0NATO mils, 6,000\u00a0Warsaw Pact mils or 6,300\u00a0Swedish \"streck\" per turn instead of 360\u00b0 or 2\u03c0 radians, achieving higher resolution than a 360\u00b0 compass while also being easier to divide into parts than if true milliradians were used.\nHistory.\nThe milliradian (approximately 6,283.185 in a circle) was first used in the mid-19th century by Charles-Marc Dapples (1837\u20131920), a &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20people\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; engineer and professor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Lausanne\"&gt;University of Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;. Degrees and minutes were the usual units of angular measurement but others were being proposed, with \"&lt;a href=\"Gradian\"&gt;grads&lt;/a&gt;\" (400\u00a0gradians in a circle) under various names having considerable popularity in much of northern Europe. However, Imperial Russia used a different approach, dividing a circle into &lt;a href=\"equilateral%20triangle\"&gt;equilateral triangle&lt;/a&gt;s (60\u00b0\u00a0per triangle, 6\u00a0triangles in a circle) and hence 600\u00a0units to a circle.\nAround the time of the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, France was experimenting with the use of milli\u00e8mes or angular mils (6400 in a circle) for use with artillery sights instead of &lt;a href=\"decigrade\"&gt;decigrade&lt;/a&gt;s (4000 in a circle). The United Kingdom was also trialing them to replace degrees and minutes. They were adopted by France although decigrades also remained in use throughout World War I. Other nations also used decigrades. The United States, which copied many French artillery practices, adopted angular mils, later known as NATO mils. Before 2007 the Swedish defence forces used \"streck\" (6300 in a circle, streck meaning lines or marks) (together with degrees for some navigation) which is closer to the milliradian but then changed to NATO mils. After the &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik%20Revolution\"&gt;Bolshevik Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the adoption of the metric system of measurement (e.g. artillery replaced \"units of base\" with meters) the Red Army expanded the 600\u00a0unit circle into a 6000\u00a0mil circle. Hence the Russian mil has a somewhat different origin than those derived from French artillery practices.\nIn the 1950s, &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; adopted metric units of measurement for land and general use. NATO mils, meters, and kilograms became standard, although degrees remained in use for naval and air purposes, reflecting civil practices.\nMathematical principle.\nUse of the milliradian is practical because it is concerned with &lt;a href=\"skinny%20triangle\"&gt;small angles&lt;/a&gt;, and when using radians the &lt;a href=\"small%20angle%20approximation\"&gt;small angle approximation&lt;/a&gt; shows that the angle approximates to the &lt;a href=\"sine\"&gt;sine&lt;/a&gt; of the angle, that is formula_1. This allows a user to dispense with &lt;a href=\"trigonometry\"&gt;trigonometry&lt;/a&gt; and use simple ratios to determine size and distance with high accuracy for rifle and short distance artillery calculations by using the handy property of subtension: \"One mrad approximately subtends one meter at a distance of one thousand meters\".\nMore in detail, because formula_2, instead of finding the &lt;a href=\"angular%20distance\"&gt;angular distance&lt;/a&gt; denoted by \u03b8 (Greek letter &lt;a href=\"theta\"&gt;theta&lt;/a&gt;) by using the &lt;a href=\"tangent%20function\"&gt;tangent function&lt;/a&gt;\none can instead make a &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20series%23Approximation%20error%20and%20convergence\"&gt;good approximation&lt;/a&gt; by using the definition of a radian and the simplified formula:\nSince a &lt;a href=\"radian\"&gt;radian&lt;/a&gt; is mathematically defined as the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals the radius of the circle, a milliradian, is the angle formed when the length of a circular arc equals of the radius of the circle. Just like the radian, the milliradian is &lt;a href=\"Dimensionless%20quantity\"&gt;dimensionless&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the radian where the same unit must be used for radius and arc length, the milliradian needs to have a ratio between the units where the subtension is a thousandth of the radius when using the simplified formula.\nApproximation error.\nThe &lt;a href=\"approximation%20error\"&gt;approximation error&lt;/a&gt; by using the simplified linear formula will increase as the angle increases. For example, a\nThe approximation using mrad is more precise than using another common system where 1\u2032\u00a0(&lt;a href=\"Arcminute\"&gt;minute of arc&lt;/a&gt;) is approximated as 1\u00a0inch at 100\u00a0yards, where comparably there is a:\nSight adjustment.\nMilliradian adjustment is commonly used as a unit for clicks in the mechanical adjustment knobs (turrets) of &lt;a href=\"iron%20sights\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"telescopic%20sight\"&gt;scope sights&lt;/a&gt; both in the military and civilian &lt;a href=\"shooting%20sports\"&gt;shooting sports&lt;/a&gt;. New shooters are often explained the principle of subtensions in order to understand that a milliradian is an angular measurement. \"Subtension\" is the physical amount of space covered by an angle and varies with distance. Thus, the subtension corresponding to a mrad (either in an mrad reticle or in mrad adjustments) varies with range. Knowing subtensions at different ranges can be useful for sighting in a firearm if there is no optic with an mrad reticle available, but involves mathematical calculations, and is therefore not used very much in practical applications. Subtensions always change with distance, but an mrad (as observed through an optic) is always an mrad regardless of distance. Therefore, &lt;a href=\"ballistic%20table\"&gt;ballistic table&lt;/a&gt;s and shot corrections are given in mrads, thereby avoiding the need for mathematical calculations.\nIf a rifle scope has mrad markings in the reticle (or there is a &lt;a href=\"spotting%20scope\"&gt;spotting scope&lt;/a&gt; with an mrad reticle available), the reticle can be used to measure how many mrads to correct a shot even without knowing the shooting distance. For instance, assuming a precise shot fired by an experienced shooter missed the target by 0.8\u00a0mrad as seen through an optic, and the firearm sight has 0.1\u00a0mrad adjustments, the shooter must then dial 8\u00a0clicks on the scope to hit the same target under the same conditions.\nSubtensions at different distances.\nSubtension refers to the length between two points on a target, and is usually given in either centimeters, millimeters or inches. Since an mrad is an angular measurement, the subtension covered by a given angle (&lt;a href=\"angular%20distance\"&gt;angular distance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"angular%20diameter\"&gt;angular diameter&lt;/a&gt;) increases with viewing distance to the target. For instance the same angle of 0.1\u00a0mrad will subtend 10\u00a0mm at 100 meters, 20\u00a0mm at 200\u00a0meters, etc., or similarly 0.39\u00a0inches at 100\u00a0m, 0.78\u00a0inches at 200\u00a0m, etc.\nSubtensions in mrad based optics are particularly useful together with target sizes and shooting distances in &lt;a href=\"metric%20system\"&gt;metric units&lt;/a&gt;. The most common scope adjustment increment in mrad based rifle scopes is 0.1\u00a0mrad, which are sometimes called \"one centimeter clicks\" since 0.1\u00a0mrad equals exactly 1\u00a0cm at 100\u00a0meters, 2\u00a0cm at 200\u00a0meters, etc. Similarly, an adjustment click on a scope with 0.2\u00a0mrad adjustment will move the point of bullet impact 2\u00a0cm at 100\u00a0m and 4\u00a0cm at 200\u00a0m, etc.\nWhen using a scope with both mrad adjustment and a reticle with mrad markings (called a mrad/mrad scope), the shooter can spot his own bullet impact and easily correct the sight if needed. If the shot was a miss, the mrad reticle can simply be used as a \"ruler\" to count the number of mrads the shot was off target. The number of mrads to correct is then multiplied by ten if the scope has 0.1\u00a0mrad adjustments. If for instance the shot was 0.6\u00a0mrad to the right of the target, 6\u00a0clicks will be needed to adjust the sight. This way there is no need for math, conversions, knowledge of target size or distance. This is true for a first focal plane scope at all magnifications, but a variable second focal plane must be set to a given magnification (usually its maximum magnification) for any mrad scales to be correct.\nWhen using a scope with mrad adjustments, but without mrad markings in the reticle (i.e. a standard duplex cross-hair on a hunting or benchrest scope), sight correction for a known target subtension and known range can be calculated by the following formula, which utilizes the fact that an adjustment of 1\u00a0mrad changes the impact as many millimeters as there are meters:\nFor instance:\nIn firearm optics, where 0.1\u00a0mrad per click is the most common mrad based adjustment value, another common rule of thumb is that:\n\"An adjustment of \u00a0mrad changes the impact as many centimeters as there are hundreds of meters.\"\nI.e., 1\u00a0cm at 100\u00a0meters, 2.25\u00a0cm at 225\u00a0meters, 0.5\u00a0cm at 50\u00a0meters, etc., see the table below\nAdjustment range and base tilt.\nThe horizontal and vertical adjustment range of a firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mrads. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a vertical adjustment range of 20\u00a0mrad, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20\u00a0meters at 1000\u00a0meters (or 2\u00a0m at 100\u00a0m, 4\u00a0m at 200\u00a0m, 6\u00a0m at 300\u00a0m etc.). The horizontal and vertical adjustment ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20\u00a0mrad vertical and 10\u00a0mrad horizontal adjustment. Elevation differ between models, but about 10\u201311\u00a0mrad are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for &lt;a href=\"long%20range%20shooting\"&gt;long range shooting&lt;/a&gt; usually have an adjustment range of 20\u201330\u00a0mrad (70\u2013100\u00a0moa).\nSights can either be mounted in neutral or tilted mounts. In a neutral mount (also known as \"flat base\" or non-tilted mount) the sight will point reasonably parallel to the barrel, and be close to a zero at 100\u00a0meters (about 1\u00a0mrad low depending on rifle and caliber). After zeroing at 100\u00a0meters the sight will thereafter always have to be adjusted upwards to compensate for bullet drop at longer ranges, and therefore the adjustment below zero will never be used. This means that when using a neutral mount only about half of the scope's total elevation will be usable for shooting at longer ranges:\nIn most regular sport and hunting rifles (except for in long range shooting), sights are usually mounted in neutral mounts. This is done because the optical quality of the scope is best in the middle of its adjustment range, and only being able to use half of the adjustment range to compensate for bullet drop is seldom a problem at short and medium range shooting.\nHowever, in long range shooting tilted &lt;a href=\"scope%20mount\"&gt;scope mount&lt;/a&gt;s are common since it is very important to have enough vertical adjustment to compensate for the bullet drop at longer distances. For this purpose scope mounts are sold with varying degrees of tilt, but some common values are:\nWith a tilted mount the maximum usable scope elevation can be found by:\nThe adjustment range needed to shoot at a certain distance varies with firearm, caliber and load. For example, with a certain &lt;a href=\".308%20Winchester\"&gt;.308&lt;/a&gt; load and firearm combination, the bullet may drop 13\u00a0mrad at 1000\u00a0meters (13\u00a0meters). To be able to reach out, one could either:\nShot groupings.\nA shot grouping is the spread of multiple shots on a target, taken in one shooting session. The group size on target in milliradians can be obtained\nby measuring the spread of the rounds on target in &lt;a href=\"millimeter\"&gt;millimeter&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"calipers\"&gt;caliper&lt;/a&gt; and dividing by the shooting distance in meters. This way, using milliradians, one can easily compare shot groupings or target difficulties at different shooting distances.\nIf the firearm is attached in a fixed mount and aimed at a target, the shot grouping measures the firearm's mechanical precision and the uniformity of the ammunition. When the firearm also is held by a shooter, the shot grouping partly measures the precision of the firearm and ammunition, and partly the shooter's consistency and skill. Often the shooters' skill is the most important element towards achieving a tight shot grouping, especially when competitors are using the same match grade firearms and ammunition.\nRange estimation with mrad reticles.\nMany telescopic sights used on rifles have &lt;a href=\"reticle\"&gt;reticle&lt;/a&gt;s that are marked in mrad. This can either be accomplished with lines or dots, and the latter is generally called mil-dots. The mrad reticle serves two purposes, range estimation and trajectory correction.\nWith a mrad reticle-equipped scope the distance to an object can be estimated with a fair degree of accuracy by a trained user by determining how many milliradians an object of known size subtends. Once the distance is known, the drop of the bullet at that range (see &lt;a href=\"external%20ballistics\"&gt;external ballistics&lt;/a&gt;), converted back into milliradians, can be used to adjust the aiming point. Generally mrad-reticle scopes have both horizontal and vertical crosshairs marked; the horizontal and vertical marks are used for range estimation and the vertical marks for bullet drop compensation. Trained users, however, can also use the horizontal dots to compensate for bullet drift due to wind. Milliradian-reticle-equipped scopes are well suited for long shots under uncertain conditions, such as those encountered by military and law enforcement &lt;a href=\"sniper\"&gt;sniper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"varmint%20rifle\"&gt;varmint hunters&lt;/a&gt; and other field shooters. These riflemen must be able to aim at varying targets at unknown (sometimes long) distances, so accurate compensation for bullet drop is required.\nAngle can be used for either calculating target size or range if one of them is known. Where the range is known the angle will give the size, where the size is known then the range is given. When out in the field angle can be measured approximately by using calibrated optics or roughly using one's fingers and hands. With an outstretched arm one finger is approximately 30\u00a0mrad wide, a fist 150\u00a0mrad and a spread hand 300\u00a0mrad.\nMilliradian reticles often have dots or marks with a spacing of 1\u00a0mrad in between, but graduations can also be finer and coarser (i.e. 0.8 or 1.2\u00a0mrad).\nUnits for target size and range.\nWhile a radian is defined as an angle on the unit circle where the arc and radius have equal length, a milliradian is defined as the angle where the arc length is one thousandth of the radius. Therefore, when using milliradians for range estimation, the unit used for target distance needs to be thousand times as large as the unit used for target size. Metric units are particularly useful in conjunction with a mrad reticle because the &lt;a href=\"mental%20calculation\"&gt;mental arithmetic&lt;/a&gt; is much simpler with decimal units, thereby requiring less mental calculation in the field. Using the range estimation formula with the units meters for range and millimeters for target size it is just a matter of moving decimals and do the division, without the need of multiplication with additional constants, thus producing fewer rounding errors.\nThe same holds true for calculating target distance in kilometers using target size in meters.\nAlso, in general the same unit can be used for subtension and range if multiplied with a factor of thousand, i.e.\nIf using the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20units\"&gt;imperial units&lt;/a&gt; yards for distance and inches for target size, one has to multiply by a factor of \u2248 27.78, since there are 36 inches in one yard.\nIf using the metric unit meters for distance and the imperial unit inches for target size, one has to multiply by a factor of 25.4, since one inch is defined as 25.4\u00a0millimeters.\nPractical examples.\n&lt;a href=\"Land%20Rover%20Series\"&gt;Land Rovers&lt;/a&gt; are about 3 to 4\u00a0m long, \"smaller tank\" or &lt;a href=\"Armoured%20personnel%20carrier\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Infantry%20fighting%20vehicle\"&gt;MICV&lt;/a&gt; at about 6\u00a0m (e.g. &lt;a href=\"T-34\"&gt;T-34&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BMP-3\"&gt;BMP&lt;/a&gt;) and about 10\u00a0m for a \"big tank.\" From the front a Land Rover is about 1.5\u00a0m wide, most tanks around 3\u20133.5\u00a0m. So a SWB Land Rover from the side is one finger wide at about 100\u00a0m. A modern tank would have to be at a bit over 300\u00a0m.\nIf, for instance a target known to be 1.5\u00a0m in height (1500\u00a0mm) is measured to 2.8\u00a0mrad in the reticle, the range can be estimated to:\nSo if the above-mentioned 6\u00a0m long BMP (6000\u00a0mm) is viewed at 6\u00a0mrad its distance is 1000\u00a0m, and if the angle of view is twice as large (12\u00a0mrad) the distance is half as much, 500\u00a0m.\nWhen used with some riflescopes of variable objective magnification and fixed reticle magnification (where the reticle is in the second focal plane), the formula can be modified to:\nWhere mag is scope magnification. However, a user should verify this with their individual scope since some are not calibrated at 10\u00d7\u00a0. As above target distance and target size can be given in any two units of length with a ratio of 1000:1.\nMixing mrad and minutes of arc.\nIt is possible to purchase rifle scopes with a mrad reticle and minute-of-arc turrets, but it is general consensus that such mixing should be avoided. It is preferred to either have both a mrad reticle and mrad adjustment (mrad/mrad), or a minute-of-arc reticle and minute-of-arc adjustment to utilize the strength of each system. Then the shooter can know exactly how many clicks to correct based on what he sees in the reticle.\nIf using a mixed system scope that has a mrad reticle and arcminute adjustment, one way to make use of the reticle for shot corrections is to exploit that 14\u2032 approximately equals 4\u00a0mrad, and thereby multiplying an observed corrections in mrad by a fraction of when adjusting the turrets.\nConversion table for firearms.\nIn the table below conversions from mrad to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1\u00a0mrad equals exactly 1\u00a0cm at 100\u00a0meters), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.\nDefinitions for maps and artillery.\nBecause of the definition of pi, in a circle with a diameter of one there are 2000\u00a0 milliradians () per full turn. In other words, one real milliradian covers just under of the circumference of a circle, which is the definition used by telescopic rifle sight manufacturers in reticles for &lt;a href=\"stadiametric%20rangefinding\"&gt;stadiametric rangefinding&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor maps and artillery, three rounded definitions are used which are close to the real definition, but more easily can be divided into parts. The different map and artillery definitions are sometimes referred to as \"angular mils\", and are:\nReticles in some artillery sights are calibrated to the relevant artillery definition for that military, i.e. the Carl Zeiss OEM-2 artillery sight made in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; from 1969 to 1976 is calibrated for the eastern bloc 6000 mil circle.\nVarious symbols have been used to represent angular mils for compass use:\nUse in artillery sights.\nArtillery uses angular measurement in gun laying, the azimuth between the gun and its target many kilometers away and the elevation angle of the barrel. This means that artillery uses mils to graduate indirect fire azimuth sights (called \"dial sights\" or \"panoramic telescopes\"), their associated instruments (\"directors\" or \"aiming circles\"), their elevation sights (&lt;a href=\"clinometer\"&gt;clinometer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"quadrant%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;quadrant&lt;/a&gt;s), together with their manual plotting devices, firing tables and fire control computers.\nArtillery spotters typically use their calibrated binoculars to move fired projectiles' impact onto a target. Here they know the approximate range to the target and so can read off the angle (+ quick calculation) to give the left/right corrections in meters. A mil is a meter at a range of one thousand meters (for example, to move the impact of an artillery round 100 meters by a gun firing from 3\u00a0km away, it is necessary to shift the direction by 100/3 = 33.3 mils.)\nOther scientific and technological uses.\nThe milliradian (and &lt;a href=\"Radian%23SI%20multiples\"&gt;other SI multiples&lt;/a&gt;) is also used in other fields of &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; for describing small angles, i.e. measuring alignment, &lt;a href=\"Collimated%20light\"&gt;collimation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"beam%20divergence\"&gt;beam divergence&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"optics\"&gt;optics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"accelerometer\"&gt;accelerometer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gyroscope\"&gt;gyroscope&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"inertial%20navigation%20system\"&gt;inertial navigation system&lt;/a&gt;s."
