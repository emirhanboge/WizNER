Aberystwyth Rugby Club was founded in 1947 and the first game was against an Aberystwyth College second team. The club gained membership of the Welsh Rugby Union in May, 1954 which allowed future competitive matches. The team's clubhouse was founded with help of a ten-year interest-free loan from the WRU in 1960. This original clubhouse burned down and was reconstructed in the 1970s."
