Deacon bought the mill in 1933 and changed it into a feed manufacturing complex.\nIn 1939 an east warehouse was constructed and a concrete grain elevator was completed in 1950. The tower was completed in 1956 which made the facility the first electronic feed manufacturing plant in Texas and also the first business to deliver bulk feed. The mill closed down in 1979. In 1995 a fire damaged many parts of the building and also damaged parts of the tower's panels."
