    "text": "The politics of &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; take place in a framework of a &lt;a href=\"presidential%20system\"&gt;presidential&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Representative%20democracy\"&gt;representative democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"multi-party%20system\"&gt;multi-party system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Executive%20power\"&gt;Executive power&lt;/a&gt; is exercised by the president and their cabinet, and the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;President of Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; is both the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20government\"&gt;head of government&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20power\"&gt;Legislative power&lt;/a&gt; is vested in the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The president and 57 Legislative Assembly deputies are elected for four-year terms. The &lt;a href=\"judiciary\"&gt;judiciary&lt;/a&gt; operates independent of the executive and the legislature but remains involved in the political process. &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; with a strong system of constitutional checks and balances. Voting is compulsory in Costa Rica but it is not enforced.\nThe position of governor in the seven &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s was abolished in 1998. There are no provincial legislatures. In 2009, the state &lt;a href=\"monopoly\"&gt;monopolies&lt;/a&gt; on insurance and telecommunications were opened to private-sector competition. Certain other state agencies enjoy considerable operational independence and autonomy; they include the &lt;a href=\"Instituto%20Costarricense%20de%20Electricidad\"&gt;electrical power company&lt;/a&gt; (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad), the nationalized commercial banks (which are open to competition from private banks), and &lt;a href=\"Caja%20Costarricense%20del%20Seguro%20Social\"&gt;the social security agency&lt;/a&gt; (Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social). &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica has no military&lt;/a&gt; but maintains a domestic police force and a Special Forces Unit as part of the Ministry of the President.\nRecent history.\nThe 1986 presidential election was won by &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Arias\"&gt;\u00d3scar Arias&lt;/a&gt; of the PLN. During his tenure he experienced some criticism from within his own party for abandoning its traditional social democratic teachings and promoting a &lt;a href=\"neoliberal\"&gt;neoliberal&lt;/a&gt; economic model. He received the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars then raging in several Central American countries.\nIn the February 1998 national election, PUSC candidate &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Rodr%C3%ADguez\"&gt;Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt; won the presidency over PLN nominee &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Miguel%20Corrales%20Bola%C3%B1os\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Miguel Corrales Bola\u00f1os&lt;/a&gt;. President Rodriguez assumed office May 8, 1998. The PUSC also obtained 27 seats in the 57-member Legislative Assembly, for a plurality, while the PLN got 23 and five minor parties won seven. Social Christian in philosophy, the PUSC generally favors neoliberalism, conservative fiscal policies, and government reform. President Rodriguez pledged to reduce the country's large &lt;a href=\"internal%20debt\"&gt;internal debt&lt;/a&gt;, privatize state-owned utilities, attract additional foreign investment, eliminate social welfare programs, and promote the creation of jobs with decent salaries.\nThe reforms he tried to promote found opposition from several parties, including his own, and he asserted several times the country was \"ungovernable\". In particular, an attempt by the Legislative Assembly to approve a law that opened up the electricity and telecommunication markets (controlled by a monopoly of the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity - ICE) to market competition, known as the \"Combo\" law, was met with strong social opposition. The Combo law was supported by both major parties at the time (PLN and PUSC) as well as by President Rodriguez, but the first of three required legislative votes to approve it provoked the largest protest demonstrations the country had seen since 1970. The government quickly resolved to shelve the initiative. President Rodr\u00edguez's approval would reach an all-time low, and he was indicted by the Attorney General after leaving office on corruption charges.\nIn September 2000 the Constitutional Court rejected an argument by former president Arias that a 1969 constitutional amendment banning presidential reelection be rescinded. Arias thus remained barred from a second term as president; however, in April 2003\u2013by which time two of the four judges who had voted against the change in 2000 had been replaced\u2013the Court reconsidered the issue and, with the only dissenters being the two anti-reelection judges remaining from 2000, declared the 1969 amendment null and thus opened the way to reelection for former presidents\u2013which in practice meant Arias.\nIn the 2002 national election, a new party founded by former PLN Congressman and government Minister &lt;a href=\"Ott%C3%B3n%20Sol%C3%ADs\"&gt;Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; captured 26% of the vote, forcing a runoff election for the first time in the country's history. &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Pacheco\"&gt;Abel Pacheco&lt;/a&gt; was elected president, under a national unity platform, but continuing most of the neoliberal and conservative policies of &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Rodr%C3%ADguez\"&gt;Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt;. This election was also important because new parties won several seats in Congress, more than ever. The PUSC obtained 19 seats, PLN 17 seats, PAC 14 seats, PML 6 seats and PRC one seat.\nDuring 2004, several high-profile corruption scandals shattered the foundations of PUSC. Two former presidents from the party, Miguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez and &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20%C3%81ngel%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Fournier\"&gt;Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, were arrested on corruption charges and are currently waiting for the investigation to end and trial to begin. Also involved in scandals has been &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Figueres\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres&lt;/a&gt;, former president from PLN and former head of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Economic%20Forum\"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2006 national election was expected to be a landslide for former president (1986\u20131990) and PLN's candidate &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Arias\"&gt;\u00d3scar Arias&lt;/a&gt;, but it turned out to be the closest in modern history. Although polls just a week before the election gave Arias a comfortable lead of at least 12% (and up to 20%), preliminary election results gave him only a .4% lead over rival &lt;a href=\"Ott%C3%B3n%20Sol%C3%ADs\"&gt;Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; and prompted a manual recount of all ballots. After a month-long recount and several appeals from different parties, Arias was declared the official winner with 40.9% of the votes against 39.8% for Sol\u00eds.\nWhen \u00d3scar Arias returned to office, the political debate shifted to the ratification of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;Central American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (CAFTA). Main supporters of the approval included the President's PLN, which established a coalition with PUSC and ML in Congress to approve the implementation laws in Congress, as well as different business chambers. The main opposition to CAFTA came from PAC, &lt;a href=\"Trade%20unions%20in%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt;, environmental organizations and public universities. In April 2007, former PLN Presidential candidate and CAFTA opponent &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Miguel%20Corrales%20Bola%C3%B1os\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Miguel Corrales Bola\u00f1os&lt;/a&gt; won a legal battle at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which authorized him to gather over 100,000 signatures to send CAFTA to a referendum and let the people decide the fate of the controversial agreement. As the February 28, 2008 deadline to approve or reject CAFTA loomed, Arias decided to call for the referendum himself, and it took take place on October 7, 2007. CAFTA was approved with 51.5% of voters supporting it, although the election faced criticism due to international, including US, involvement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rican%20general%20election%2C%202010\"&gt;Costa Rican general election, 2010&lt;/a&gt; was won by &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Chinchilla\"&gt;Laura Chinchilla&lt;/a&gt; of centrist &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberation%20Party%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;National Liberation Party&lt;/a&gt;, who had been vice-president in the previous Arias administration. In May 2010, she was sworn in as the first female President of Costa Rica.\nIn 2014, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Guillermo%20Sol%C3%ADs\"&gt;Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds&lt;/a&gt;, PAC's presidential candidate campaigning on a platform of economic reform and anti-corruption, surprised political observers by winning 30.95% of votes in the first round, while PLN candidate &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Araya\"&gt;Johnny Araya&lt;/a&gt; gained the second most votes with 29.95%. &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Front%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;Broad Front&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Villalta%20Florez-Estrada\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Villalta Florez-Estrada&lt;/a&gt; won 17% of the votes. Soon thereafter, Araya announced that he would cease campaigning, making Sol\u00eds the favorite. Elections were still be held on April 6, 2014, as required by election law, and Sol\u00eds won with 77.81% of the votes. According to the BBC, the success of Sol\u00eds and Villalta is another example of anti-neoliberal politics in Latin America.\nIn April 2018, &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Alvarado%20Quesada\"&gt;Carlos Alvarado&lt;/a&gt; won the presidential election. He became the new President of Costa Rica, succeeding President Guillermo Sol\u00eds. Both Solis and Alvarado represented centre-left &lt;a href=\"Citizens%27%20Action%20Party%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;Citizens' Action Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical involvement of government institutions.\nExecutive branch.\nExecutive responsibilities are vested in a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;, who is elected to a term of four years directly by the voters, not by the National Assembly as it would be in a parliamentary system. There also are two vice presidents and the president's cabinet composed of his ministers. A constitutional amendment approved in 1969 limits presidents and deputies to one term, although a deputy may run again for an Assembly seat after sitting out a term. The prohibition was officially recognized as unconstitutional in April 2004, allowing &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Arias\"&gt;\u00d3scar Arias&lt;/a&gt; to run for president a second time in the &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica%20presidential%20elections%2C%202006\"&gt;2006 Costa Rican presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;, which he won with approximately a 1% margin.\nThe President of Costa Rica has limited powers, particularly in comparison to other Latin American Presidents. For example, he cannot veto the legislative budget, and thus Congress is sovereign over the year's single most important piece of legislation. On the other hand, he can appoint anyone to his cabinet without approval from Congress. This provides the single most important power versus Congress that any Costa Rican President has.\nLegislative branch.\nLegislative powers are held by the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Legislators, called deputies, are elected to non-consecutive four-year terms by popular, &lt;a href=\"direct%20vote\"&gt;direct vote&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; in each of the country's seven provinces. Elections were last held in February 2014 and will be held again in February 2018. As a result, there are nine separate political parties serving in the Legislative Assembly, with &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberation%20Party%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;National Liberation Party&lt;/a&gt; holding 18 seats, the &lt;a href=\"Citizens%27%20Action%20Party%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;Citizens' Action Party&lt;/a&gt; holding 13, and &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Front%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;Broad Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Christian%20Unity%20Party\"&gt;Social Christian Unity Party&lt;/a&gt; each holding 8. Other parties hold the remaining seats.\nJudicial branch.\nThe main arm of the judiciary is the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Supreme Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-two magistrates are selected for the CSJ for 8-year terms by the Legislative Assembly, and lower courts. Sala IV, also known as the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, reviews legislation, executive actions, and certain &lt;a href=\"writ\"&gt;writ&lt;/a&gt;s for constitutionality. Courts below the Sala IV deal with issues involving legal and criminal disputes. Additionally, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE for its Spanish initials) is an independent branch of the CSJ, responsible for democratic elections. While the judiciary is independent of the politically elected executive and legislative branches, it is often responsible for resolving political and legal conflicts.\nInstitutional oversight.\nA &lt;a href=\"Comptroller\"&gt;Comptroller General&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Procurator%20General%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Procurator General&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Ombudsman\"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; oversee the government and operate autonomously. These institutions have the right to scrutinize, investigate and prosecute government contracts. In addition, they may impose procedural requirements on most political and governmental agencies. The actions of politicians and political parties are frequently researched by these institutions.\nElections.\nOn the national level, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"vice-presidents\"&gt;vice-presidents&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; are elected for a four-year term. The &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; has 57 members, elected by &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; in each of the country's seven provinces.\nThe electoral process is supervised by an independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE for its Spanish initials). The TSE is a commission of three principal magistrates and six alternates selected by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;. All elections are conducted by a secret ballot at local polling stations.\nOn election days, political parties often organize caravans and marches to get supporters to polling stations. In many areas, voting takes on a festive atmosphere with supporters of each party wearing traditional colors and decorating their cars, houses, and livestock with colored ribbons. Because the day of elections is a national holiday, most people have the day off.\nPolitical parties.\nCurrently, there are nine active political parties with representation in the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;. An additional twelve parties ran, but did not receive enough votes to earn a seat in the assembly, making the total number of active parties in Costa Rica twenty-one. Starting in the 2000s, disagreement about many of the neo-liberal policies promoted by the dominant PLN caused the traditional party system of alliances among a few parties to fracture. Although still a stable country, the shift toward many political parties and away from PUSC and PLN is a recent development. Various elected positions within the country, such as mayors and city council members, are held by many different national and local political parties."
