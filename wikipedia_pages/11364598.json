    "text": " \nThe Lublin R-XX was the &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bomber\"&gt;torpedo bomber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt;, designed in the early 1930s in the &lt;a href=\"Plage%20i%20La%C5%9Bkiewicz\"&gt;Plage i La\u015bkiewicz&lt;/a&gt; factory in &lt;a href=\"Lublin\"&gt;Lublin&lt;/a&gt;. It remained a prototype.\nDesign and development.\nIn 1930 the Polish Ministry of Defence announced a contest for a torpedo-bomber floatplane for the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Navy\"&gt;Polish Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Plage i La\u015bkiewicz works proposed first a floatplane variant F.VIIW of a licence-built bomber (developed from a passenger plane) &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20F.VII\"&gt;Fokker F.VII&lt;/a&gt;, but it was not built. It also proposed a floatplane variant of single-engined &lt;a href=\"Lublin%20R-VIII\"&gt;Lublin R-VIII&lt;/a&gt; biplane bomber. In a course, three R-VIIIs were converted to floatplanes and given to the Navy, but they did not meet all demands, for they were obsolete, slow and could not carry &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. Then Plage i La\u015bkiewicz proposed quite modern twin-engined plane Lublin R-XX, the main designer of which was &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Rudlicki\"&gt;Jerzy Rudlicki&lt;/a&gt;. The last design won the contest in 1932, besting &lt;a href=\"PZL-18\"&gt;PZL-18&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PWS-62\"&gt;PWS-62&lt;/a&gt; designs, and a prototype was ordered. It was initially planned to build a series of 9.\nIn 1934 the prototype was built and on 22 June transported to &lt;a href=\"Puck%2C%20Poland\"&gt;Puck&lt;/a&gt; - a base of the Naval Aviation Squadron (\"MDLot\"). It appeared there, that it was tail-heavy on water, and it demanded some modifications, like lengthening engine nacelles towards front. It first flew on 8 April 1935 (some sources: 10 April). Initially the plane was kept in secret. The design was found satisfactory, but it had also faults, like moving of centre of gravity during flight and low fuselage rigidity. The prototype was modified then and returned from the factory for further trials on 30 October 1935.\nIn early 1935 an improved variant R-XXA was developed. It had more streamlined fuselage, covered machine gun turrets with 6 machine guns, smaller span of 23.65 m and stronger engines 750\u00a0hp &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; III. The Polish Navy ordered 6 production aircraft in the beginning of 1935, with planned deliveries by April 1937, and Plage i La\u015bkiewicz prepared to build the R-XXA prototype. However, the factory at that time was about to &lt;a href=\"bankrupt\"&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; (caused by a policy of Ministry of Defence, refusing to buy &lt;a href=\"Lublin%20R-XIII\"&gt;Lublin R-XIII&lt;/a&gt;f planes), and on 23 November 1935 the Navy Headquarters broke off an order for R-XXA due to long development.\nAfter nationalization of the bankrupt Plage i La\u015bkiewicz works in 1936, as the &lt;a href=\"LWS%20%28aircraft%20manufacturer%29\"&gt;LWS&lt;/a&gt;, the R-XXA design was taken over as the LWS-1. However, its development was soon canceled in mid-1936, because the factory proposed a floatplane variant LWS-5 of slightly more modern &lt;a href=\"LWS-6%20%C5%BBubr\"&gt;LWS-6 \u017bubr&lt;/a&gt; bomber. This design was not completed as well, and the Polish Navy remained without torpedo bombers (there were finally ordered six &lt;a href=\"CANT%20Z.506\"&gt;CANT Z.506&lt;/a&gt; in Italy, but only one unarmed was delivered by the outbreak of the war).\nThe only R-XX prototype was used in the MDLot with a number 806 until September 1937, when it was written off, then scrapped in 1938. It was planned to use floats for &lt;a href=\"LWS-5\"&gt;LWS-5&lt;/a&gt; prototype.\nThere was also a preliminary design of a medium bomber R-XXB, from 1934-1935. It was to have a streamlined fuselage and covered gun turrets, similar to R-XXA. Main difference was a fixed conventional &lt;a href=\"landing%20gear\"&gt;landing gear&lt;/a&gt; with wide covers and a single tailfin. It was to carry 600\u00a0kg bombs (some sources - 1500\u00a0kg). It was less modern, than &lt;a href=\"LWS-6%20%C5%BBubr\"&gt;LWS-6 \u017bubr&lt;/a&gt; (PZL.30) and &lt;a href=\"PZL.37%20%C5%81o%C5%9B\"&gt;PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b&lt;/a&gt; and the plane, redesignated later as LWS-1/II, was not built.\nDescription.\nMixed construction low-wing cantilever &lt;a href=\"monoplane\"&gt;monoplane&lt;/a&gt;, two-engine, conventional in layout. A fuselage was square in cross-section, made of a steel frame, canvas-covered (duralumin-covered in front). Wings of wooden construction, two-spar, plywood-covered. Twin strutted tail. Crew of five: in a glazed nose a bombardier-gunner, then two pilots, sitting side by side in an open &lt;a href=\"Cockpit%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;cockpit&lt;/a&gt;. In mid-fuselage a radio operator and an upper gunner. Two Short metal floats. Four-blade wooden &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;s, later three-blade metal ones. Two fuel tanks 1680 L in wings. Armament: four 7.9\u00a0mm Vickers F &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;s on ring mountings in fuselage nose and in a dorsal position. According to some sources, also one underbelly machine gun. Bomb load: up to 1,000\u00a0kg (other sources - 600\u00a0kg) or 750\u00a0kg torpedo."
