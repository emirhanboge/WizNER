Its basin covers nearly , including the sub-basins of &lt;a href=\"Dufour%20River\"&gt;Dufour River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint-Denis%20River%20%28Kamouraska%20River%20tributary%29\"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tar%20River\"&gt;Tar River&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis source is located at southeast of the south shore of the &lt;a href=\"estuary%20of%20Saint%20Lawrence\"&gt;middle St. Lawrence estuary&lt;/a&gt;, at south-east of the center of the village of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Pac%C3%B4me%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Saint-Pac\u00f4me&lt;/a&gt;, east of the center of the village of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Gabriel-de-Kamouraska%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Saint-Gabriel-de-Kamouraska&lt;/a&gt; and south of the center of the village of &lt;a href=\"Mont-Carmel%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Mont-Carmel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom its source, the Kamouraska River flows over , with a drop of , divided into the following segments:\nThe confluence of the Kamouraska River is located west of the center of the village of Saint-Pac\u00f4me, at north of the center of the village of &lt;a href=\"La%20Pocati%C3%A8re%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;La Pocati\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; and north of the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Saint-Jean%20River%20%28La%20Pocati%C3%A8re%29\"&gt;Saint-Jean River (La Pocati\u00e8re)&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nThe earliest use of the name \u201cKamouraska River\u201d was noted in the deed of concession of the Kamouraska seigneury of July 15, 1674: \u201c[\u2026] three leagues of land abreast along of the St. Lawrence River, know: two leagues above the river called Kamouraska [\u2026]\u201d. Since the 17th century, the name \"Kamouraska River\" has been found in dozens of documents and maps. About thirty official place names in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; contain the specific Kamouraska. The origin of this Native American term remains uncertain. This name could come from the Algonquin word akamaraska meaning \"where there are rushes at the edge of the water\". While in the Mi'kmaq language, this toponymic name is explained by the term kamoo, meaning \"extended\", and askaw, meaning \"hay or rush\".\nIn the history of this area, which dates back to the beginning of the French colony, the inhabitants have made use of about fifteen other appellations designating the Kamouraska River, some of which are still in popular use.\nIn the past, this waterway was designated \"Pearl River\" on maps. This toponymic variant was initially noted in the 1920s; it would come from the presence, at the time, of &lt;a href=\"pearl%20mussels\"&gt;pearl mussels&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of this stream. In the area upstream of the river, the tributaries were designated \"Le Petit Bras\" and Rivi\u00e8re du Petit Bras, toponymic usage beginning at the beginning of the 19th century. These variants would come from the confluence, in this sector, of the Kamouraska river and the Saint-Denis river, which was commonly referred to as \u201cLe Grand Bras\u201d.\nThe toponym \u201cKamouraska River\u201d was formalized on March 7, 2006, by the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20de%20toponymie%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec\"&gt;Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec&lt;/a&gt;."
