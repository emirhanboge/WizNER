The association is formed by the current 16 clubs competing in the first division.\nThe first governing body to congregate football clubs in Peru was the Liga Peruana de Football (\"Peruvian Football League\") which was founded on 12 May 1912. The league organized its first season in 1912 with 16 clubs from &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; divided into two divisions but was discontinued after the end of the 1921 season.\nThe first division was subsequently organized by the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Peruvian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 which was founded in 1922 and became a member of &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt; in 1925. Starting in 1941, the organization of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n was passed from the Peruvian Football Federation to the newly formed Asociaci\u00f3n No Amateur (\"Non-Amateur Association\"). This organization was replaced by the Asociaci\u00f3n Central de F\u00fatbol (Central Football Association) in 1951 when the Primera Divisi\u00f3n became a professional league. Finally, in 1962, the ADFP succeeded the Asociaci\u00f3n Central de F\u00fatbol as the organizing body of the first division.\nList of Peruvian football champions.\nPeruvian football had amateur status since its foundation until 1950. In the course of this era, Alianza Lima, Atl\u00e9tico Chalaco, Municipal, Sport Boys, and Universitario de Deportes shared the most titles. The first run from 1912 to 1921 featured clubs only from Lima under the Liga Peruana de Football. In 1926 and 1927 two unofficial tournaments were played. In 1928 the first championship official expanded to Callao under the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Peruvian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;. In 1936 no tournament took place, however an unofficial tournament were played, where Universitario and Alianza Lima were champion and runner-up respectively.\nAmateur league (1912\u20131950).\nPeruvian football had amateur status since its foundation until 1950.
