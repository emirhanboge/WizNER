    "text": "Vitis vulpina (with &lt;a href=\"common%20name\"&gt;common name&lt;/a&gt;s frost grape, winter grape, fox grape, and wild grape.) is a &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;n species of herbaceous &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vine\"&gt;vine&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Vitaceae\"&gt;grape family&lt;/a&gt;. It is widespread across most of the eastern and central &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Province\"&gt;Canadian Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe genus name \"&lt;a href=\"Vitis\"&gt;Vitis&lt;/a&gt;\" comes from the Latin word for \"vine\" and the species name \"vulpina\" comes from the Latin word for \"fox-like\" or belonging to a fox. It is believed that foxes were attracted to this type of grapevine, and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; used the term \"vulpina\" to differentiate these smaller wild grapes from the other American known grapes. The more common name, frost grape, refers to the fact that this otherwise acidic/tart-tasting grape becomes more desirable and sweet once it is exposed to a frost. \"Vitis vulpina\" is a high-climbing woody vine with a thick trunk and red tendrils. The grapes and the vine itself have many uses ranging from herbal remedies to edible delicacies.\nDescription.\n\"Vitis vulpina\" has a relatively long lifespan with a moderate growth rate. Typically the vine will reach a maximum height of about 83\u00a0feet. Contrary to the name \"Frost Grape,\" the plant does not do well in cold temperatures below -23 degrees F. The only benefit of the frost on the grape is further &lt;a href=\"ripeness%20in%20viticulture\"&gt;ripening&lt;/a&gt; of these grapes between the months of September and October. The &lt;a href=\"Botanical%20berry\"&gt;berry (grape)&lt;/a&gt; is round and very tart/acidic, becoming sweet after a &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; due to a drop in &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; levels as the grape &lt;a href=\"decomposition%23Plant%20decomposition\"&gt;decomposes&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the ripening of the grapes in colder months, the leaves eventually fall off as the plant enters the &lt;a href=\"dormancy%23Plants\"&gt;dormant&lt;/a&gt; stage. Grapes tend to shrivel up on the vine, turning into &lt;a href=\"raisin\"&gt;raisin&lt;/a&gt;s if not harvested before &lt;a href=\"meteorological%20winter\"&gt;meteorological winter&lt;/a&gt;. The shriveled grapes are advantageous for animals looking for food during these months.\nThe grape vine can be either &lt;a href=\"plant%20sexuality%23Plant%20population\"&gt;monoecious or diecious&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s appearing in May to June. The flowers are arranged in compound &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt;s with 5 yellow &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s, 5 &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s and 5 &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt; (floral number is 5). The leaves are arranged alternately with a cordate shape. &lt;a href=\"leaf%23Veins\"&gt;Venation&lt;/a&gt; is palmate. Unlike other wild grapes there are no tufts of &lt;a href=\"trichome%23Plant%20trichomes\"&gt;hair&lt;/a&gt; present on the leaves. &lt;a href=\"Tendril\"&gt;Tendril&lt;/a&gt;s appear every third leaf oppositely are reddish in color and used for growth along surfaces. The grapes are tiny and dark purple.\nHabitat.\nIt is most commonly found in moist or dry soils in woods, flood plains, and ravines. Due to its known ability to climb, the vine is often used along fences and trellises for ornamentation.\nUses.\nThe grapes are edible and can be used to make wine, jam, and jellies.\nMany parts of the plant are used in herbal medicines. The leaves of the plant are used sometimes for liver treatments because they are considered &lt;a href=\"hepatic\"&gt;hepatic&lt;/a&gt;. When the leaves are wilted, they are used as a &lt;a href=\"poultice\"&gt;poultice&lt;/a&gt; to relieve tenderness of the breasts after childbirth. The bark can be infused to treat urinary problems."
