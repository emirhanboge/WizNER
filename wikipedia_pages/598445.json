    "text": "Unix System V (pronounced: \"System Five\") is one of the first commercial versions of the &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally developed by &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation\"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4 (SVR4) was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as \"Unix System Unification\", which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV.\n, the AT&amp;T-derived Unix market is divided between four System V variants: &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"AIX%20operating%20system\"&gt;AIX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hewlett%20Packard%20Enterprise\"&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"HP-UX\"&gt;HP-UX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Corporation\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29\"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;, plus the free-software &lt;a href=\"illumos\"&gt;illumos&lt;/a&gt; forked from &lt;a href=\"OpenSolaris\"&gt;OpenSolaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nIntroduction.\nSystem V was the successor to 1982's &lt;a href=\"UNIX%20System%20III\"&gt;UNIX System III&lt;/a&gt;. While AT&amp;T developed and sold hardware that ran System V, most customers ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&amp;T's &lt;a href=\"reference%20implementation\"&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt;. A standards document called the &lt;a href=\"System%20V%20Interface%20Definition\"&gt;System V Interface Definition&lt;/a&gt; outlined the default features and behavior of implementations.\nAT&amp;T support.\nDuring the formative years of AT&amp;T's computer business, the division went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&amp;T Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally &lt;a href=\"Unix%20System%20Laboratories\"&gt;Unix System Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; (USL).\nRivalry with BSD.\nIn the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the &lt;a href=\"Berkeley%20Software%20Distribution\"&gt;Berkeley Software Distribution&lt;/a&gt; (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. Historically, BSD was also commonly called \"BSD Unix\" or \"Berkeley Unix\". &lt;a href=\"Eric%20S.%20Raymond\"&gt;Eric S. Raymond&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:\nWhile HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Microsystems\"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation\"&gt;DEC&lt;/a&gt; extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC's &lt;a href=\"Ultrix\"&gt;Ultrix&lt;/a&gt; received System V features. AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based &lt;a href=\"SunOS\"&gt;SunOS&lt;/a&gt; to produce &lt;a href=\"Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29\"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;, one of the primary System V descendants still in use today. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as &lt;a href=\"POSIX\"&gt;POSIX&lt;/a&gt; and the success of &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, the division between System V and BSD has become less important.\nReleases.\nSVR1.\nSystem V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&amp;T's previous commercial Unix called &lt;a href=\"UNIX%20System%20III\"&gt;System III&lt;/a&gt; in January, 1983.\nUnix 4.0 was never released externally, which would have been designated as System IV.\nThis first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&amp;T's UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0.\nSystem V also included features such as the &lt;a href=\"vi\"&gt;vi&lt;/a&gt; editor and &lt;a href=\"curses%20%28programming%20library%29\"&gt;curses&lt;/a&gt; from 4.1 BSD, developed at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;; it also improved performance by adding buffer and &lt;a href=\"inode\"&gt;inode&lt;/a&gt; caches. It also added support for &lt;a href=\"inter-process%20communication\"&gt;inter-process communication&lt;/a&gt; using messages, &lt;a href=\"semaphore%20%28programming%29\"&gt;semaphore&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shared%20memory%20%28interprocess%20communication%29\"&gt;shared memory&lt;/a&gt;, developed earlier for the Bell-internal &lt;a href=\"CB%20UNIX\"&gt;CB UNIX&lt;/a&gt;.\nSVR1 ran on &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation\"&gt;DEC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PDP-11\"&gt;PDP-11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"VAX\"&gt;VAX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"minicomputer\"&gt;minicomputer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSVR2.\nAT&amp;T's UNIX Support Group (USG) transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL), which released System V Release 2 in 1984. SVR2 added &lt;a href=\"Unix%20shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; functions and the &lt;a href=\"System%20V%20Interface%20Definition\"&gt;SVID&lt;/a&gt;. SVR2.4 added &lt;a href=\"demand%20paging\"&gt;demand paging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copy-on-write\"&gt;copy-on-write&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shared%20memory\"&gt;shared memory&lt;/a&gt;, and record and &lt;a href=\"file%20locking\"&gt;file locking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe concept of the \"porting base\" was formalized, and the DEC &lt;a href=\"VAX-11/780\"&gt;VAX-11/780&lt;/a&gt; was chosen for this release. The \"porting base\" is the so-called original version of a release, from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate.\nEducational source licenses for SVR2 were offered by AT&amp;T for US$800 for the first CPU, and $400 for each additional CPU. A commercial source license was offered for $43,000, with three months of support, and a $16,000 price per additional CPU.\n&lt;a href=\"Apple%20Computer\"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"A/UX\"&gt;A/UX&lt;/a&gt; operating system was initially based on this release. &lt;a href=\"Xenix\"&gt;SCO XENIX&lt;/a&gt; also used SVR2 as its basis. The first release of &lt;a href=\"HP-UX\"&gt;HP-UX&lt;/a&gt; was also an SVR2 derivative.\nMaurice J. Bach's book, \"The Design of the UNIX Operating System\", is the definitive description of the SVR2 kernel.\nSVR3.\nAT&amp;T's UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL) was succeeded by AT&amp;T Information Systems (ATTIS), which distributed UNIX System V, Release 3, in 1987. SVR3 included &lt;a href=\"STREAMS\"&gt;STREAMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remote%20File%20Sharing\"&gt;Remote File Sharing&lt;/a&gt; (RFS), the File System Switch (FSS) &lt;a href=\"virtual%20file%20system\"&gt;virtual file system&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, a restricted form of &lt;a href=\"shared%20library\"&gt;shared libraries&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Transport%20Layer%20Interface\"&gt;Transport Layer Interface&lt;/a&gt; (TLI) network &lt;a href=\"application%20programming%20interface\"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. The final version was Release 3.2 in 1988, which added binary compatibility to &lt;a href=\"Xenix\"&gt;Xenix&lt;/a&gt; on Intel platforms (see &lt;a href=\"Intel%20Binary%20Compatibility%20Standard\"&gt;Intel Binary Compatibility Standard&lt;/a&gt;).\nUser interface improvements included the \"layers\" windowing system for the &lt;a href=\"Blit%20%28computer%20terminal%29\"&gt;DMD 5620&lt;/a&gt; graphics terminal, and the SVR3.2 &lt;a href=\"curses%20%28programming%20library%29\"&gt;curses libraries&lt;/a&gt; that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features (forms, panels, menus, etc.). The &lt;a href=\"3B%20Computers\"&gt;AT&amp;T 3B2&lt;/a&gt; became the official \"porting base.\"\n&lt;a href=\"SCO%20UNIX\"&gt;SCO UNIX&lt;/a&gt; was based upon SVR3.2, as was &lt;a href=\"Interactive%20Systems%20Corporation\"&gt;ISC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Interactive%20Unix\"&gt;386/ix&lt;/a&gt;. Among the more obscure distributions of SVR3.2 for the 386 were ESIX 3.2 by &lt;a href=\"Everex\"&gt;Everex&lt;/a&gt; and \"System V, Release 3.2\" sold by Intel themselves; these two shipped \"plain vanilla\" AT&amp;T's codebase.\n&lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"AIX%20operating%20system\"&gt;AIX operating system&lt;/a&gt; is an SVR3 derivative.\nSVR4.\nSystem V Release 4.0 was announced on October 18, 1988 and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early 1989 onwards. A joint project of AT&amp;T Unix System Laboratories and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Microsystems\"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;, it combined technology from:\nNew features included:\nMany companies licensed SVR4 and bundled it with computer systems such as &lt;a href=\"workstation\"&gt;workstation&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"network%20server\"&gt;network server&lt;/a&gt;s. SVR4 systems vendors included &lt;a href=\"Atari%20Corporation\"&gt;Atari&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Atari%20System%20V\"&gt;Atari System V&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20International\"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Amiga%20Unix\"&gt;Amiga Unix&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Data%20General\"&gt;Data General&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"DG/UX\"&gt;DG/UX&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Fujitsu\"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"UXP/DS\"&gt;UXP/DS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Hitachi\"&gt;Hitachi&lt;/a&gt; (HI-UX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), &lt;a href=\"NCR%20Corporation\"&gt;NCR&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Unix/NS\"&gt;Unix/NS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"NEC\"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"EWS-UX\"&gt;EWS-UX&lt;/a&gt;, UP-UX, UX/4800, &lt;a href=\"SUPER-UX\"&gt;SUPER-UX&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Oki%20Electric%20Industry\"&gt;OKI&lt;/a&gt; (OKI System V), &lt;a href=\"Pyramid%20Technology\"&gt;Pyramid Technology&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"DC/OSx\"&gt;DC/OSx&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Graphics\"&gt;SGI&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"IRIX\"&gt;IRIX&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Siemens\"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"SINIX\"&gt;SINIX&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Sony\"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sony%20NEWS\"&gt;NEWS-OS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Sumitomo%20Electric%20Industries\"&gt;Sumitomo Electric Industries&lt;/a&gt; (SEIUX), and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Microsystems\"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29\"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;) with &lt;a href=\"illumos\"&gt;illumos&lt;/a&gt; in the 2010s as the only &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; platform.\nSoftware porting houses also sold enhanced and supported &lt;a href=\"x86%20architecture\"&gt;Intel x86&lt;/a&gt; versions. SVR4 software vendors included &lt;a href=\"Dell\"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; (Dell UNIX), &lt;a href=\"Everex\"&gt;Everex&lt;/a&gt; (ESIX), Micro Station Technology (SVR4), &lt;a href=\"Microport%20%28software%29\"&gt;Microport&lt;/a&gt; (SVR4), and UHC (SVR4).\nThe primary platforms for SVR4 were Intel x86 and &lt;a href=\"SPARC\"&gt;SPARC&lt;/a&gt;; the SPARC version, called Solaris 2 (or, internally, &lt;a href=\"SunOS\"&gt;SunOS&lt;/a&gt; 5.x), was developed by Sun. The relationship between Sun and AT&amp;T was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"OpenSolaris\"&gt;OpenSolaris&lt;/a&gt; project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Corporation\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; took over Sun, Solaris was &lt;a href=\"Fork%20%28software%20development%29\"&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt;ed into proprietary release, but &lt;a href=\"illumos\"&gt;illumos&lt;/a&gt; as the continuation project is being developed in open-source.\nA consortium of Intel-based resellers including &lt;a href=\"Unisys\"&gt;Unisys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"International%20Computers%20Limited\"&gt;ICL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NCR%20Corporation\"&gt;NCR Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Olivetti\"&gt;Olivetti&lt;/a&gt; developed SVR4.0MP with &lt;a href=\"multiprocessing\"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/a&gt; capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a \"master\" processor).\nRelease 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for &lt;a href=\"Trusted%20Computer%20System%20Evaluation%20Criteria\"&gt;Orange Book&lt;/a&gt; B2 compliance and &lt;a href=\"Access%20Control%20List\"&gt;Access Control List&lt;/a&gt;s and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules.\nSVR4.2 / UnixWare.\nIn 1992, AT&amp;T USL engaged in a joint venture with &lt;a href=\"Novell\"&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Univel\"&gt;Univel&lt;/a&gt;. That year saw the release System V.4.2 as Univel &lt;a href=\"UnixWare\"&gt;UnixWare&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the &lt;a href=\"Veritas%20File%20System\"&gt;Veritas File System&lt;/a&gt;. Other vendors included UHC and Consensys. Release 4.2MP, completed late 1993, added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare 2 in 1995.\nEric S. Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR4.2 versions, as they often did not include on-line &lt;a href=\"man%20pages\"&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt;. In his 1994 buyers guide, he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories.\nSVR5 / UnixWare 7.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20Operation\"&gt;Santa Cruz Operation&lt;/a&gt; (SCO), owners of Xenix, eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release 4.2 codebase from Novell, while other vendors (Sun, IBM, HP) continued to use and extend System V Release 4. Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Group\"&gt;The Open Group&lt;/a&gt;. \nSystem V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Cruz%20Operation\"&gt;Santa Cruz Operation&lt;/a&gt; (SCO) as a merger of &lt;a href=\"SCO%20OpenServer\"&gt;SCO OpenServer&lt;/a&gt; (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers. It was released as SCO UnixWare 7. SCO's successor, &lt;a href=\"The%20SCO%20Group\"&gt;The SCO Group&lt;/a&gt;, also based &lt;a href=\"SCO%20OpenServer\"&gt;SCO OpenServer&lt;/a&gt; 6 on SVR5, but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller.\nSVR6 (cancelled).\nSystem V Release 6 was announced by SCO to be released by the end of 2004, but was apparently cancelled. It was supposed to support 64-bit systems. The industry has coalesced around &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Group\"&gt;The Open Group&lt;/a&gt;'s Single UNIX Specification version 3 (&lt;a href=\"Single%20UNIX%20Specification\"&gt;UNIX 03&lt;/a&gt;). See also: &lt;a href=\"Smallfoot\"&gt;Smallfoot&lt;/a&gt;\nMarket position.\nAvailability during the 1990s on x86 platforms.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, a variety of SVR4 versions of Unix were available commercially for the x86 PC platform. However, the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and BSD became widely available. In late 1994, Eric S. Raymond discontinued his \"PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer's Guide\" on &lt;a href=\"USENET\"&gt;USENET&lt;/a&gt;, stating, \"The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now, and I no longer find the SVr4 market interesting or significant.\"\nIn 1998, a &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Documents\"&gt;confidential memo&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft stated, \"Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market\", and further predicted, \"I believe that Linux\u00a0\u2013 moreso than &lt;a href=\"Windows%20NT\"&gt;NT&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.\"\nAn \"&lt;a href=\"InfoWorld\"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;\" article from 2001 characterized SCO UnixWare as having a \"bleak outlook\" due to being \"trounced\" in the market by Linux and Solaris, and IDC predicted that SCO would \"continue to see a shrinking share of the market\".\nProject Monterey.\nProject Monterey was started in 1998 to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms, as a joint project of &lt;a href=\"Compaq\"&gt;Compaq&lt;/a&gt;, IBM, Intel, SCO, and &lt;a href=\"Sequent%20Computer%20Systems\"&gt;Sequent Computer Systems&lt;/a&gt;. The target platform was meant to be Intel's new &lt;a href=\"IA-64\"&gt;IA-64&lt;/a&gt; architecture and &lt;a href=\"Itanium\"&gt;Itanium&lt;/a&gt; line of processors. However, the project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after little progress.\nSystem V and the Unix market.\nBy 2001, several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare, Compaq &lt;a href=\"Tru64%20UNIX\"&gt;Tru64 UNIX&lt;/a&gt;, and SGI IRIX were all in decline. The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, and Sun's Solaris.\nIn 2006, when SGI declared bankruptcy, analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether. In a 2006 article written for \"&lt;a href=\"Computerworld\"&gt;Computerworld&lt;/a&gt;\" by Mark Hall, the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux:\nThe article also cites trends in high-performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux:\nIn a November 2015 survey of the top 500 supercomputers, Unix was used by only 1.2% (all running IBM AIX), while Linux was used by 98.8%; the same survey in November 2017 reports 100% of them using Linux.\nSystem V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms. The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX (IBM), Solaris (Oracle), and HP-UX (HP). According to a study done by &lt;a href=\"International%20Data%20Corporation\"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;, in 2012 the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM (56%), Oracle (19.2%), and HP (18.6%). No other commercial Unix vendor had more than 2% of the market. Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline.\nOpenSolaris and illumos distributions.\nOpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR4 descendants that are &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open-source software&lt;/a&gt;. \nCore system software continues to be developed as &lt;a href=\"illumos\"&gt;illumos&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Illumos%23Current%20Illumos%20distributions\"&gt;illumos distributions&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"SmartOS\"&gt;SmartOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omniosce\"&gt;Omniosce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"OpenIndiana\"&gt;OpenIndiana&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nSystem V compatibility.\nThe System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix-like operating systems not derived from System V; in particular, in Linux (a reimplementation of Unix) as well as the BSD derivative &lt;a href=\"FreeBSD\"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;. POSIX 2008 specifies a replacement for these interfaces.\nFreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the &lt;a href=\"COFF\"&gt;COFF&lt;/a&gt; format, which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR3.2 derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX. Modern System V, Linux, and BSD platforms use the &lt;a href=\"Executable%20and%20Linkable%20Format\"&gt;ELF&lt;/a&gt; file format for natively compiled binaries."
