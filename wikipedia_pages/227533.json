    "text": "Hornets (insects in the genus Vespa) are the largest of the &lt;a href=\"Eusociality\"&gt;eusocial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt;s, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives &lt;a href=\"yellowjacket\"&gt;yellowjacket&lt;/a&gt;s. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other &lt;a href=\"Vespinae\"&gt;vespine&lt;/a&gt; wasps by the relatively large &lt;a href=\"vertex%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;top margin of the head&lt;/a&gt; and by the rounded &lt;a href=\"gaster%20%28insect%20anatomy%29\"&gt;segment of the abdomen&lt;/a&gt; just behind the waist. Worldwide, 22 species of \"Vespa\" are recognized. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the &lt;a href=\"European%20hornet\"&gt;European hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"V. crabro\"), is widely distributed throughout &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Asia\"&gt;Northeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Wasps native to North America in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Dolichovespula\"&gt;Dolichovespula&lt;/a&gt;\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g., &lt;a href=\"baldfaced%20hornet\"&gt;baldfaced hornet&lt;/a&gt;s), but are actually &lt;a href=\"yellowjacket\"&gt;yellowjacket&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLike other social wasps, hornets build communal nests by chewing wood to make a papery pulp. Each nest has one queen, which lays eggs and is attended by workers that, while genetically female, cannot lay fertile eggs. Most species make exposed nests in trees and shrubs, but some (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Vespa%20orientalis\"&gt;Vespa orientalis&lt;/a&gt;\") build their nests underground or in other cavities. In the tropics, these nests may last year-round, but in temperate areas, the nest dies over the winter, with lone queens hibernating in leaf litter or other insulative material until the spring. Male hornets are docile and do not have stingers.\nHornets are often considered pests, as they aggressively guard their nesting sites when threatened and their stings can be more dangerous than those of &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClassification.\nWhile taxonomically well defined, some confusion may remain about the differences between hornets and other wasps of the family &lt;a href=\"Vespidae\"&gt;Vespidae&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the yellowjackets, which are members of the same subfamily. Also, a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, \"&lt;a href=\"Provespa\"&gt;Provespa&lt;/a&gt;\", is referred to as \"night wasps\" or \"night hornets\", though they are not true hornets.\nSome other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the &lt;a href=\"bald-faced%20hornet\"&gt;bald-faced hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dolichovespula maculata\") found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name \"hornet\" is used for this species primarily because of its habit of making aerial nests (similar to some of the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20hornet\"&gt;Australian hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"Abispa ephippium\"), which is actually a species of &lt;a href=\"potter%20wasp\"&gt;potter wasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nHornets are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. The common &lt;a href=\"European%20hornet\"&gt;European hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"V. crabro\") is the best-known species, widely distributed in Europe (but is never found north of the &lt;a href=\"63rd%20parallel%20north\"&gt;63rd parallel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"European%20Russia\"&gt;European Russia&lt;/a&gt; (except in extreme northern areas). In the east, the species' distribution area stretches over the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"West%20Siberian%20Plain\"&gt;western Siberia&lt;/a&gt; (found in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Khanty-Mansiysk\"&gt;Khanty-Mansiysk&lt;/a&gt;). In Asia, the common European hornet is found in southern Siberia, as well as in &lt;a href=\"East%20China\"&gt;eastern China&lt;/a&gt;. The common European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe. However, it has never been found in western North America.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Asian%20giant%20hornet\"&gt;Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"V. mandarinia\") lives in the &lt;a href=\"Primorsky%20Krai\"&gt;Primorsky Krai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsky%20Krai\"&gt;Khabarovsky Krai&lt;/a&gt; (southern part), and &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20AO\"&gt;Jewish AO&lt;/a&gt; regions of Russia, and China, Korea, &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indochina\"&gt;Indochina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, but is most commonly found in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, where they are commonly known as the giant sparrow bee.\nThe Oriental hornet (\"V. orientalis\") occurs in semidry, subtropical areas of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagestan\"&gt;Dagestan&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan, &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tajikistan\"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyrghyzstan\"&gt;Kyrghyzstan&lt;/a&gt;, southern &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"southern%20Europe\"&gt;southern Europe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Asian%20hornet\"&gt;Asian hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"V. velutina\") has been introduced to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nStings.\nHornets have &lt;a href=\"stinger\"&gt;stinger&lt;/a&gt;s used to kill prey and defend nests. Hornet stings are more painful to humans than typical wasp stings because hornet venom contains a large amount (5%) of &lt;a href=\"acetylcholine\"&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt;. Individual hornets can sting repeatedly; unlike &lt;a href=\"honey%20bee\"&gt;honey bee&lt;/a&gt;s, hornets do not die after stinging because their stingers are very finely barbed (only visible under high magnification) and can easily be withdrawn, so are not pulled out of their bodies when disengaging.\nThe toxicity of hornet stings varies according to hornet species; some deliver just a typical insect sting, while others are among the most venomous known insects. Single hornet stings are not in themselves fatal, except sometimes to allergic victims. Multiple stings by hornets (other than \"V. crabro\") may be fatal because of highly toxic species-specific components of their venom.\nThe stings of the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20giant%20hornet\"&gt;Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt; (\"V. mandarinia\") are among the most venomous known, and are thought to cause 30\u201350 human deaths annually in Japan. Between July and September 2013, hornet stings caused the death of 42 people in China. Asian giant hornet's venom can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure leading to death, though &lt;a href=\"dialysis\"&gt;dialysis&lt;/a&gt; can be used to remove the toxins from the bloodstream.\nPeople who are allergic to wasp venom may also be allergic to hornet stings. Allergic reactions are commonly treated with &lt;a href=\"epinephrine\"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt; (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an &lt;a href=\"epinephrine%20autoinjector\"&gt;epinephrine autoinjector&lt;/a&gt;, with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into &lt;a href=\"anaphylaxis\"&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt; and die unless treated promptly. In general, \"Vespa\" stings induce the release of &lt;a href=\"histamine\"&gt;histamine&lt;/a&gt; due to the various &lt;a href=\"mastoparan\"&gt;mastoparan&lt;/a&gt;s that they contain. However \"V. orientalis\" &lt;a href=\"mastoparan\"&gt;mastoparan&lt;/a&gt; is the interesting exception because it does not induce histamine increase in victim tissue - because it does not cause &lt;a href=\"mast%20cell\"&gt;mast cell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"degranulation\"&gt;degranulation&lt;/a&gt; - and is not &lt;a href=\"immunogenicity\"&gt;immunogenic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttack pheromone.\nHornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack &lt;a href=\"pheromone\"&gt;pheromone&lt;/a&gt; is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the Asian giant hornet (\"V. mandarinia\"), this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, &lt;a href=\"honey%20bee\"&gt;honey bee&lt;/a&gt;s and other \"Vespa\" species. Three biologically active chemicals, &lt;a href=\"Pentan-2-ol\"&gt;2-pentanol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3-methyl-1-butanol\"&gt;3-methyl-1-butanol&lt;/a&gt;, and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a &lt;a href=\"Synergy\"&gt;synergistic&lt;/a&gt; effect. In the European hornet (\"V. crabro\") the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.\nIf a hornet is killed near a nest, it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come into contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain &lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;C5 alcohols&lt;/a&gt; and C10 &lt;a href=\"esters\"&gt;esters&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife cycle.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Vespa%20crabro\"&gt;V. crabro&lt;/a&gt;\", the nest is founded in spring by a fertilized female known as the queen. She generally selects sheltered places such as dark, hollow tree trunks. She first builds a series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top. An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5\u20138 days, the egg hatches. Over the following two weeks, the larva progresses through five stages of development. During this time, the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then, the larva spins a silk cap over the cell's opening, and during the next two weeks, transforms into an adult, a process called &lt;a href=\"Insect%20metamorphosis\"&gt;metamorphosis&lt;/a&gt;. The adult then eats its way through the silk cap. This first generation of workers, invariably females, now gradually undertakes all the tasks formerly carried out by the queen (&lt;a href=\"foraging\"&gt;foraging&lt;/a&gt;, nest building, taking care of the &lt;a href=\"brood%20%28honeybee%29\"&gt;brood&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Oviposition\"&gt;egg-laying&lt;/a&gt;, which remains exclusive to the queen.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Group%20size%20measures\"&gt;colony size&lt;/a&gt; grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. To be able to build cells in total darkness, they apparently use gravity to aid them. At the peak of its population, which occurs in late summer, the colony can reach a size of 700 workers.\nAt this time, the queen starts producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called \"&lt;a href=\"gynes\"&gt;gynes&lt;/a&gt;\" by entomologists), and unfertilized ones develop into males (sometimes called \"drones\" as with &lt;a href=\"drone%20%28bee%29\"&gt;honeybee drones&lt;/a&gt;). Adult males do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid-autumn, they leave the nest and mate during \"&lt;a href=\"nuptial%20flight\"&gt;nuptial flight&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nOther temperate species (e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Vespa%20simillima\"&gt;yellow hornet&lt;/a&gt;, \"V. simillima\", or the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20hornet\"&gt;Oriental hornet&lt;/a&gt;, \"V. orientalis\") have similar cycles. In the case of tropical species (e.g., \"V. tropica\"), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20giant%20hornet\"&gt;Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt;, \"V. mandarinia\"), the cycle likely depends on latitude.\nDiet and feeding.\nAdult hornets and their relatives (e.g., yellowjackets) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of &lt;a href=\"oak%20trees\"&gt;oak trees&lt;/a&gt;, rotting sweet fruits, honey, and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit, and tend to gnaw a hole in fruit to become totally immersed in its pulp. A person who accidentally picks fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect.\nThe adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as &lt;a href=\"honey%20bee\"&gt;honey bee&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"locust\"&gt;locust&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"katydid\"&gt;katydid&lt;/a&gt;s without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the &lt;a href=\"larvae\"&gt;larvae&lt;/a&gt; developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.\nThe larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.\nSpecies.\nWhile a history of recognizing subspecies exists within many of the \"Vespa\" species, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus \"Vespa\" as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.\nAs food and medicine.\nHornet larvae are widely accepted as food in mountainous regions in China. \nHornets and their nests are treated as medicine in traditional Chinese medicine."
