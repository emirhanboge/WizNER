    "text": "St. Paul's Mission was a &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28Christian%29\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; church established in the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company\"&gt;Hudson's Bay Company&lt;/a&gt;'s (HBC) &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20District\"&gt;Columbia District&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest\"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1830s. The mission was built near the HBC's &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Colville\"&gt;Fort Colville&lt;/a&gt;, on the bluff then overlooking &lt;a href=\"Kettle%20Falls\"&gt;Kettle Falls&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia River&lt;/a&gt;. The building still stands today.\nHistory.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; missionaries visited Kettle Falls several times from 1836 on, attempting to convert &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;natives&lt;/a&gt; to Christianity.\nThe first missionaries, representatives of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Board%20of%20Commissioners%20for%20Foreign%20Missions\"&gt;American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions&lt;/a&gt; and sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterianism\"&gt;Presbyterians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Congregational%20church\"&gt;Congregationalists&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in 1836. They were unable to baptize any Indians.\nCatholic missionaries, led by French-Canadian Fathers &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Norbert%20Blanchet\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Norbert Blanchet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modeste%20Demers\"&gt;Modeste Demers&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in 1838. They delivered the first Catholic mass between the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountains\"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cascade%20Range\"&gt;Cascade Range&lt;/a&gt; in 1839 and baptized 19 Indians, but were unable to establish a permanent mission. Their efforts were more focused on &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20%28St.%20Paul%2C%20Oregon%29\"&gt;St. Paul Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Willamette%20Valley\"&gt;Willamette Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Belgian &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Jean%20De%20Smet\"&gt;Father DeSmet&lt;/a&gt;'s preaching to the Sxoielpi (&lt;a href=\"Colville%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Colville Indians&lt;/a&gt;) in August 1845, a small log chapel was built. Two years later the present hand-hewn log church replaced it. Sometime around 1869, St. Paul's Mission was abandoned in favor of a location seven miles north of the present city of &lt;a href=\"Colville%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Colville&lt;/a&gt;. Damaged by fire in 1910, the present structure was restored in 1939\u201340."
