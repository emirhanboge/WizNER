    "text": "A trigger transformer is a small, usually ferrite cored &lt;a href=\"transformer\"&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt; used in applications requiring a high voltage pulse, typically to start &lt;a href=\"ionization\"&gt;ionization&lt;/a&gt; of a gas to allow a current to pass.\nUses.\nTrigger transformer &lt;a href=\"Transformer%23Cores\"&gt;cores&lt;/a&gt; may be utilized in a unipolar (&lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20flux\"&gt;electromagnetic flux&lt;/a&gt; strictly positive or negative) or bipolar (swinging between positive and negative) manner. Applications also differ in whether or not they saturate the core (termed a saturating trigger transformer).\n&lt;a href=\"Strobe%20light\"&gt;Strobe light&lt;/a&gt;s, for instance operate the core in a unipolar, unsaturated mode. &lt;a href=\"Capacitor\"&gt;Capacitor&lt;/a&gt;s are charged to approx. 300 volts, at which point a second capacitor pulses voltage through the transformer, achieving the approx. 2000-6000 volts (depending upon the characteristics of the specific flash tube) necessary to overcome the resistance of the inert gas (such as &lt;a href=\"xenon\"&gt;xenon&lt;/a&gt;) between the electrodes, &lt;a href=\"Ionization\"&gt;ionizing&lt;/a&gt; it.\nTrigger transformers operate by means of a secondary coil with hundreds, even thousands, of turns of very fine copper wire, trading current for voltage.\nMuch light in &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=\"Plasma%20%28physics%29\"&gt;plasma&lt;/a&gt; has much lower &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the capacitor can discharge rapidly across it. The capacitors begin charging again, starting the cycle anew and giving rise to their characteristic periodic flashing. Capacitors alone would result in a continuous arc. Having achieved the voltage necessary to cause &lt;a href=\"dielectric%20breakdown\"&gt;dielectric breakdown&lt;/a&gt;, they would maintain it indefinitely.\nSo-called saturating trigger transformers find use in circuits that intentionally utilize core saturation and/or operate in a bipolar fashion, such as &lt;a href=\"Direct%20current\"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;-to-&lt;a href=\"Alternating%20current\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; power inverters.\nInductors are also commonly used in place of a trigger transformer, however are not considered transformers themselves, although similar in operation."
