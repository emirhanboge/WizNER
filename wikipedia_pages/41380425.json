    "text": "A threeleaper or tr\u00e9buchet is a &lt;a href=\"fairy%20chess%20piece\"&gt;fairy chess piece&lt;/a&gt; that jumps three squares orthogonally (the directions a chess &lt;a href=\"Rook%20%28chess%29\"&gt;rook&lt;/a&gt; can move), leaping over any intermediate piece. Below, it is given the symbol H from &lt;a href=\"Fairy%20chess%20piece%23Ralph%20Betza%27s%20%26quot%3Bfunny%20notation%26quot%3B\"&gt;Betza notation&lt;/a&gt;.\nValue.\nThe threeleaper by itself is not much more powerful than a &lt;a href=\"pawn%20%28chess%29\"&gt;pawn&lt;/a&gt;, but as an additional power to other pieces it is worth about half a &lt;a href=\"knight%20%28chess%29\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;. Its value as a piece by itself is severely compromised by its being only being able to reach a ninth of the squares on any size of chessboard; combining it with other pieces usually masks this weakness to some extent."
