    "text": "The New South Wales Department of Prisons, later the Department of Corrective Services (DCS), was a &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;State government&lt;/a&gt; agency in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, that managed &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"parole\"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"community%20service\"&gt;community service&lt;/a&gt;. Established in 1874 as the Department of Prisons, DCS was absorbed into the State &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Justice%20%282009%E2%80%9319%29\"&gt;Department of Justice and Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.\nHistory.\nBefore 1874.\nGreat Britain started the European settlement of the &lt;a href=\"Colony%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Colony of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; in 1788, establishing a &lt;a href=\"penal%20colony\"&gt;penal colony&lt;/a&gt; at what is now &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The incentive to establishment the colony came from the conclusion (1783) of the &lt;a href=\"American%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, which forced Britain to find ways of dealing with criminals other than &lt;a href=\"penal%20transportation\"&gt;transporting&lt;/a&gt; them to North America. The initial settlement at &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Cove\"&gt;Sydney Cove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Jackson\"&gt;Port Jackson&lt;/a&gt; involved housing convicts in tents, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Marines\"&gt;marines&lt;/a&gt;. Further convict shipments followed, and a surge of &lt;a href=\"convicts\"&gt;convicts&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Sydney after the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; ended in 1815. Convicts worked for pay and, where good behaviour was demonstrated, could be assigned to masters. Chain gangs operated from 1826 up until transportation ended in 1840.\nIn the colony's early years, prisons and executions were managed first by the &lt;a href=\"provost%20marshal\"&gt;provost marshal&lt;/a&gt;, a military officer, and then, from 1824, by the &lt;a href=\"sheriff\"&gt;sheriff&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepartment of Prisons.\nThe colony established its first Department of Prisons in 1874, with Sheriff Harold Maclean appointed as the first Comptroller-General.\nDepartment of Corrective Services.\nThe Department changed its name to 'Corrective Services' in 1970, and McGeechan's title changed to Commissioner. Eight years later, the Wran Government accepted &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission%20into%20New%20South%20Wales%20Prisons\"&gt;the Royal Commission's recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that the post of commissioner be abolished in favour of a three-person Corrective Services Commission.\nThe Government appointed academic &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Vinson\"&gt;Tony Vinson&lt;/a&gt; as the chairman of the new Corrective Services Commission. Vinson implemented many of the Royal Commission recommendations, but by 1981 found himself in conflict with the officers' union, the Public Service Association. The Government backed the union in the dispute, and Vinson retired to academia. The tenure of his replacement, Vern Dalton, was memorable for a corruption scandal that saw the Minister for Corrections, &lt;a href=\"Rex%20Jackson\"&gt;Rex Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, sentenced to 10 years' gaol for corruption.\nLabor, tarnished by this and other scandals, was swept from office in 1988: the Liberal\u2013Nationals coalition that replaced them campaigned on a 'tough on crime' platform. Dalton was moved to a different department and the Corrective Services Commission was abolished in favour of a single director-general on 9 August 1988. The first director-general was former police officer Angus Graham.\nIn October 1991 the department was restructured, with its juvenile justice responsibilities being transferred to a separate agency and Graham's title changed to Commissioner.\nAs part of a broader consolidation of government departments in 2009, the Department of Corrective Services was merged with the departments of the Attorney-General and Juvenile Justice in 2009. Corrective Services New South Wales became a division of what is now known as the Department of Justice, with Woodham retaining his role as Commissioner.\nPast chief executives.\n&lt;a href=\"Commissioner_of_Corrective_Services_%28New_South_Wales%29\"&gt;List of past Commissioners for New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;"
