    "text": "Pinkney \"Pink\" Anderson (February 12, 1900 \u2013 October 12, 1974) was an American &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; singer and guitarist.\nLife and career.\nAnderson was born in &lt;a href=\"Laurens%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Laurens, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and raised in nearby &lt;a href=\"Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Greenville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Spartanburg&lt;/a&gt;. He joined Dr. William R. Kerr of the Indian Remedy Company in 1914 to entertain the crowds, while Kerr tried to sell a concoction purported to have medicinal qualities. During this time Anderson occasionally worked with &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Simmie%20Dooley\"&gt;Blind Simmie Dooley&lt;/a&gt; in the Spartanburg area, recording with him in 1928 for the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; label. In the 1950s Anderson toured with Leo \"Chief Thundercloud\" Kahdot and his medicine show, often with the harmonica player Arthur \"&lt;a href=\"Peg%20Leg%20Sam\"&gt;Peg Leg Sam&lt;/a&gt;\" Jackson, who was based in &lt;a href=\"Jonesville%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Jonesville, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnderson was recorded by the folklorist &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Clayton%20%28folksinger%29\"&gt;Paul Clayton&lt;/a&gt; at the Virginia State Fair in May 1950.\nHe recorded an album in the early 1960s and performed at some live venues. He appeared in the 1963 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bluesmen\"&gt;The Bluesmen&lt;/a&gt;\". He reduced his activities in the late 1960s after a stroke. Attempts by the folklorist Peter B. Lowry to record Anderson in 1970 were not successful, although apparently he could occasionally summon up some of his past abilities. A final &lt;a href=\"concert%20tour\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; took place in the early 1970s with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Book%20Binder\"&gt;Roy Book Binder&lt;/a&gt;, one of his students, taking him to Boston and New York City.\nHe died in October 1974 of a heart attack, at the age of 74. He is interred at Lincoln Memorial Gardens, in Spartanburg.\nAnderson's son, known as &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pink%20Anderson\"&gt;Little Pink Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (born July 13, 1954), is a bluesman living in &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%2C%20South%20Dakota\"&gt;Vermillion, South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pink in Pink Floyd.\n&lt;a href=\"Syd%20Barrett\"&gt;Syd Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, of English &lt;a href=\"progressive%20rock\"&gt;progressive rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Floyd\"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, created the band's name by juxtaposing the first names of Anderson and &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; bluesman &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Council\"&gt;Floyd Council&lt;/a&gt;."
