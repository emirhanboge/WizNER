    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (Taiwan) and the &lt;a href=\"Federative%20Republic%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Federative Republic of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; do not have official &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20relations\"&gt;diplomatic relations&lt;/a&gt;, as Brazil acknowledges the &lt;a href=\"One-China%20policy\"&gt;One-China policy&lt;/a&gt;. However, the two nations maintain unofficial diplomatic relations via economic and cultural offices.\nHistory.\nFormal relations between the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Empire of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were established in September 1880 with the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. The Chinese refused, however, to permit Brazilians to hire Chinese as &lt;a href=\"Coolies\"&gt;contract laborers&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that non-white laborers were treated \"as machines or as cheap labour\". The British were also opposed to the importation of Chinese labor to Brazil, believing it would inevitably result in \"de facto\" slavery. (&lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;Slavery in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; was only abolished in 1888.) Late in 1893, Jos\u00e9 de Costa Azevedo, Baron of Ladario, went to Beijing to negotiate a new treaty on immigration, but the Chinese were uninterested. Relations continued under the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (ROC) on its founding in 1912 which Brazil recognized and maintained even after the central government was moved to the former &lt;a href=\"Taiwan%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Japanese colony&lt;/a&gt; of Taiwan (1895\u20131945).\nIn 1971, Brazil voted against &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly%20Resolution%202758\"&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758&lt;/a&gt; which replaced the ROC with the PRC at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, but from August 15, 1974, Brazil recognized the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (PRC) and suspended diplomatic relation with &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (Taiwan). After diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Brazil were suspended, both diplomatic missions were replaced by representative offices.\nRepresentation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Taiwanese Government&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Taipei%20Economic%20and%20Cultural%20Office%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; () at &lt;a href=\"Bras%C3%ADlia\"&gt;Bras\u00edlia&lt;/a&gt;, and two other offices in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. The office in Rio de Janeiro was closed in 2002.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Government of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; similarly established the &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20Office%20of%20Brazil%20to%20Taipei\"&gt;Commercial Office of Brazil to Taipei&lt;/a&gt; (, ) in the capital of Taiwan.\nTaiwanese immigration to Brazil.\nSignificant immigration of Taiwanese to Brazil started in 1960s. Most Taiwanese Brazilian were farmers from &lt;a href=\"Kaohsiung\"&gt;Kaohsiung&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany Taiwanese Brazilian now live in &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul\"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29\"&gt;Paran\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. In the northern Brazil, the fifth-large city &lt;a href=\"Recife\"&gt;Recife&lt;/a&gt; is another main settlement of Taiwanese Brazilian, mostly from &lt;a href=\"Meinong%2C%20Kaohsiung\"&gt;Meinong, Kaohsiung&lt;/a&gt;. In the suburbs of S\u00e3o Paulo, over hundred Taiwanese Brazilian established mushroom farms which supply all of Brazil.\nEconomic relations.\nTaiwan is one of Brazil's most important trade partners in Asia. The main export products from Brazil to Taiwan are &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soybean\"&gt;soybean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corn\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;. Brazil is the eighteenth trade partner for Taiwan. The main products which Taiwan exports to Brazil are electrical equipment, record equipment, &lt;a href=\"LCD\"&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; products and &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; products.\nMany Taiwanese electronic companies have established factories in Brazil. AS &lt;a href=\"Foxconn\"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asus\"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micro-Star%20International\"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Compal%20Electronics\"&gt;Compal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gigabyte_Technology\"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acer%20Inc.\"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AOC%20International\"&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D-Link\"&gt;D-Link&lt;/a&gt; and so on."
