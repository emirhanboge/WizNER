Jackson then won a scholarship to study conducting for three years at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Northern%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal Northern College of Music&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. \nCareer.\nHaving concluded his studies, in 1992 he joined &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Welsh National Opera&lt;/a&gt; as chorus master, r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur and conductor. He soon earned a reputation for his prodigious keyboard skills and his ability to conduct scores from memory.\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Jackson was \"Kapellmeister\" (principal conductor) at the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20Bremen\"&gt;Theater Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, where he managed the new production of &lt;a href=\"Shostakovich\"&gt;Shostakovich&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Macbeth%20of%20the%20Mtsensk%20District%20%28opera%29\"&gt;\"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk\"&lt;/a&gt; to critical acclaim. He became \"Generalmusikdirektor\" (Director of Music) of the Theater Krefeld and M\u00f6nchengladbach in 2003. Despite being a non-smoker, he was diagnosed in 2009 with stage 4 lung cancer. He concluded his tenure in this post in early July 2012, just over a fortnight before his death.

He felt that his finest achievement was the premi\u00e8re of Heuke's work Das Frauenorchester von Auschwitz, an opera that tells how female prisoners at the concentration camp made music together under the direction of Alma Ros\u00e9, Mahler's niece. At the time it provoked much discussion in German musical circles.
