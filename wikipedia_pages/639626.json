Their sound was described as hard-edged, &lt;a href=\"post-grunge\"&gt;post-grunge&lt;/a&gt; rock. The band began as Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys in &lt;a href=\"Tacoma%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Tacoma, Washington&lt;/a&gt; before becoming Green Apple Quick Step, in Seattle, by 1992. The initial lineup under the new name consisted of lead vocalist &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Willman\"&gt;Tyler Willman&lt;/a&gt;, guitarists Daniel Kempthorne and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Ross%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Steve Ross&lt;/a&gt;, singer-bassist &lt;a href=\"Mari%20Ann%20Braeden\"&gt;Mari Ann Braeden&lt;/a&gt;, and drummer Bob 'Mink' Martin.\nThe original lineup recorded and released two records: \"&lt;a href=\"Wonderful%20Virus\"&gt;Wonderful Virus&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1993 and \"&lt;a href=\"Reloaded%20%28Green%20Apple%20Quick%20Step%20album%29\"&gt;Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1995. Their third album, \"New Disaster\", was recorded in 1998, with new lineup including Dana Turner on guitar and Dain Hudson on drums was planned for release that year, but remains shelved. Their music has been featured on the soundtracks for three films, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Basketball%20Diaries%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Basketball Diaries&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Know%20What%20You%20Did%20Last%20Summer\"&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Homegrown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Homegrown&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThey disbanded in 1998 and then re-emerged more than a decade later to perform more shows in 2010, with Willman hopeful of releasing their third album. As of May 2010, the band consisted of lead vocalist Ty Willman, guitarist Dana Turner, and drummer &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Reading\"&gt;Geoff Reading&lt;/a&gt;, with guitarist &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Squires%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Mike Squires&lt;/a&gt; and vocalist Christa Wells joining them for the reunion shows.\nHistory.\nEarly years as Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys (1989\u20131992).\nGreen Apple Quick Step started as the Tacoma-based band, Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, consisting of vocalist Tyler Willman, guitarists Steve Ross and Dan Kempthorne, drummer Bob Martin and bassist Eric Munday. The band played a few shows locally and in 1989, &lt;a href=\"Aroma%20Records\"&gt;Aroma Records&lt;/a&gt; released 700 copies of their numbered, limited edition purple vinyl EP,\"Another World\", which was recorded at &lt;a href=\"Tombstone%20Records\"&gt;Tombstone Records&lt;/a&gt; and contained 4 songs: \"Soul Step\", \"Seamonkeys\", \"Another World\", and \"Eleventeen\".

The band that would eventually become &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Jam\"&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; played their first-ever show (when they were still called Mookie Blaylock) for Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, on October 22, 1990 at the Off Ramp Cafe in &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.\nReformation and \"Wonderful Virus\" (1992\u20131994).\nLater in 1992, the band reformed in Seattle, Washington as Green Apple Quick Step, with a new bassist, Mari Ann Braeden. They performed locally, sharing bills with &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Water%20%28band%29\"&gt;Sweet Water&lt;/a&gt;, Meddaphysical and Best Kissers in the World, before recording their debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Wonderful%20Virus\"&gt;Wonderful Virus&lt;/a&gt;\", at &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Animals%20Studios\"&gt;Bad Animals Studios&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle The album was produced by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Rey\"&gt;Daniel Rey&lt;/a&gt; and released in 1993 through The Medicine Label, which was initially backed by &lt;a href=\"Reprise%20Records\"&gt;Reprise Records&lt;/a&gt; before switching to &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Records%20%28Warner%29\"&gt;Giant Records&lt;/a&gt;.

In the middle of their fourth US tour in support of \"Wonderful Virus\", their van was stolen along with all of their equipment inside. The band later packed up their remaining belongings and returned to Seattle to begin recording their second album.\n\"Reloaded\" (1994\u20131996).\nWith &lt;a href=\"Nick%20DiDia\"&gt;Nick DiDia&lt;/a&gt; and Pearl Jam guitarist &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Gossard\"&gt;Stone Gossard&lt;/a&gt; producing, Green Apple Quick Step began recording their second album in October 1994. The band had befriended Gossard previously and asked if he would be interested in working with the band.
