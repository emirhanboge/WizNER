    "text": "Johanna Meier (born February 13, 1938) is an &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt;. She has been described as \"one of the foremost &lt;a href=\"Wagnerian%20sopranos\"&gt;Wagnerian sopranos&lt;/a&gt; of her era\". She had an international career, including fourteen years at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; and three summers singing the role of Isolde in &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Tristan%20und%20Isolde\"&gt;Tristan und Isolde&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Bayreuth%20Festival\"&gt;Bayreuth Festival&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Festival's first American Isolde.\nLife and career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, Meier was raised in &lt;a href=\"Spearfish%2C%20South%20Dakota\"&gt;Spearfish, South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and continues to contribute to the State, having founded the School of Opera and Vocal Arts as part of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hills%20State%20University\"&gt;Black Hills State University&lt;/a&gt; Summer Institute of the Arts, for which she also serves as &lt;a href=\"Artistic%20Director\"&gt;Artistic Director&lt;/a&gt;. As her family was touring with the Luenen &lt;a href=\"Passion%20Play\"&gt;Passion Play&lt;/a&gt; when she was born, she had her stage debut at five weeks and grew up playing various parts; she continued the family's tradition through 2008, staging the play with her husband each summer in Spearfish, with Meier playing the role of Mary.\nMeier trained at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Miami\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frost%20School%20of%20Music\"&gt;Frost School of Music&lt;/a&gt; and received the school's first Distinguished Alumnus Award. She also studied under &lt;a href=\"John%20Brownlee%20%28baritone%29\"&gt;John Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%20School%20of%20Music\"&gt;Manhattan School of Music&lt;/a&gt; before beginning her professional career in 1969 at the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Opera\"&gt;New York City Opera&lt;/a&gt;, where she sang &lt;a href=\"Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; roles, slowly adding in roles from &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Strauss\"&gt;Richard Strauss&lt;/a&gt;'s operas before finally taking on the Wagnerian roles for which she is best known. The City Opera recognized that she was talented both as a singer and as an actress and cast her in several leads.\nMeier's debut at the Metropolitan Opera came earlier than planned: she had been scheduled to debut in December 1976, playing Marguerite in \"&lt;a href=\"Faust%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt;\", but was sent onstage in April as a last-minute replacement for &lt;a href=\"Montserrat%20Caball%C3%A9\"&gt;Montserrat Caball\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; as Ariadne in \"&lt;a href=\"Ariadne%20auf%20Naxos\"&gt;Ariadne auf Naxos&lt;/a&gt;\". During her fourteen years at the Met, she played fifteen roles, including &lt;a href=\"Elektra%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Chrysothemis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Senta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fidelio\"&gt;Leonore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Die%20Frau%20ohne%20Schatten\"&gt;the Empress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Der%20Rosenkavalier\"&gt;the Marschallin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Elisabeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Grimes\"&gt;Ellen Orford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Donna Anna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tosca\"&gt;Tosca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Die%20Walk%C3%BCre\"&gt;Sieglinde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen\"&gt;Br\u00fcnnhilde&lt;/a&gt; and Isolde. Especially her interpretation of Wagner's \"Liebestod\" is a miracle of subtlety. Meier was seen in the title role of \"Vanessa\" (with &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Keene\"&gt;Christopher Keene&lt;/a&gt; conducting), when it was televised from the &lt;a href=\"Spoleto%20Festival%20USA\"&gt;Spoleto Festival USA&lt;/a&gt;, in 1978. She began her stint at Bayreuth in 1981 in the widely praised production of Tristan und Isolde by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Pierre%20Ponnelle\"&gt;Jean-Pierre Ponnelle&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.); this production was eventually recorded on video. Her final professional performance, in 1994, was as &lt;a href=\"Elektra%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Elektra&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2003, she received an honorary doctorate from Black Hills State University. She was married to Guido Della Vecchia from 1960 until his death in 2013. In January 2014, Meier was awarded the National Opera Association's Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 2008, Miss Meier's book, \"The Black Hills Passion Play\", was published by &lt;a href=\"Arcadia%20Publishing\"&gt;Arcadia Publishing&lt;/a&gt;."
