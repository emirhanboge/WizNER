    "text": "Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, Baron de Rothschild (8 February 1868 \u2013 27 August 1937), was a British banker, politician, &lt;a href=\"zoology\"&gt;zoologist&lt;/a&gt; and soldier, who was a member of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Rothschild%20family\"&gt;Rothschild family&lt;/a&gt;. As a prominent &lt;a href=\"Zionist\"&gt;Zionist&lt;/a&gt; leader, he was presented with the famous &lt;a href=\"Balfour%20Declaration\"&gt;Balfour Declaration&lt;/a&gt; which pledged to a Jewish national home in &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. Rothschild was the president of the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews\"&gt;Board of Deputies of British Jews&lt;/a&gt; from 1925 to 1926.\nEarly life.\nWalter Rothschild was born in London as the eldest son and heir of Emma Louise von Rothschild and &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild\"&gt;Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild&lt;/a&gt;, an immensely wealthy financier of the international Rothschild financial dynasty and the first &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Peerage\"&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt; in England.\nThe eldest of three children, Walter was deemed to have delicate health and was educated at home. As a young man, he travelled in Europe, attending the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bonn\"&gt;University of Bonn&lt;/a&gt; for a year before entering &lt;a href=\"Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Magdalene College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. In 1889, leaving Cambridge after two years, he was required to go into the family banking business to study finance.\nAt the age of seven, he declared that he would run a zoological museum and, as a child, he collected &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Butterfly\"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt; and other animals. Among his pets at the family home in &lt;a href=\"Tring%20Park%20Mansion\"&gt;Tring Park&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s and exotic birds. As a boy, Rothschild was once dragged off his horse and assaulted by workmen while on a hunting ride near Tring, an experience he attributed to &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt 21, he reluctantly went to work at the family bank, &lt;a href=\"N%20M%20Rothschild%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;N M Rothschild &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. He worked there from 1889 to 1908. He evidently lacked any interest or ability in the financial profession, but it was not until 1908, at the age of 40, that he was finally allowed to give it up. However, his parents established a zoological museum as a compensation and footed the bill for expeditions all over the world to seek out animals.\nRothschild was tall, suffered from a speech impediment and was very shy, but he had his photograph taken riding on a &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20tortoise\"&gt;giant tortoise&lt;/a&gt; and drove a carriage harnessed to four &lt;a href=\"zebra\"&gt;zebra&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Buckingham%20Palace\"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; to prove that zebras could be tamed.\nThough he never married, Rothschild had two mistresses, one of whom bore him a daughter.\nZoological career.\nRothschild studied zoology at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Meeting &lt;a href=\"Albert%20G%C3%BCnther\"&gt;Albert G\u00fcnther&lt;/a&gt; sparked his interest in the &lt;a href=\"taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; of birds and butterflies.\nAlthough Rothschild himself travelled and collected in Europe and North Africa for many years, his work and health concerns limited his range and beginning while at Cambridge he employed others (explorers, professional collectors and residents) to collect for him in remote and little-known parts of the world. He also hired taxidermists, a librarian and, most importantly, professional scientists to work with him to curate and write up the resulting collections: &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Hartert\"&gt;Ernst Hartert&lt;/a&gt;, for birds, from 1892 until his retirement at the age of 70 in 1930 and &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Jordan\"&gt;Karl Jordan&lt;/a&gt; for entomology, from 1893 until Rothschild's death in 1937.\nAt its largest, Rothschild's collection included 300,000 bird skins, 200,000 birds' eggs, 2,250,000 butterflies and 30,000 beetles as well as thousands of specimens of mammals, reptiles and fishes. They formed the largest zoological collection ever amassed by a private individual.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rothschild%20giraffe\"&gt;Rothschild giraffe&lt;/a&gt; (\"Giraffa camelopardis rothschildi\"), a subspecies with five &lt;a href=\"ossicone\"&gt;ossicone&lt;/a&gt;s instead of two, was named after him. Another 153 insects, 58 birds, 17 mammals, three fish, three spiders, two reptiles, one millipede and one worm also carry his name.\nRothschild opened his private museum in 1892. It housed one of the largest &lt;a href=\"natural%20history\"&gt;natural history&lt;/a&gt; collections in the world and was open to the public. In 1932, he was forced to sell the vast majority of his bird collection to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; after he had been blackmailed by a former mistress.\nIn 1933, he was one of eleven people, involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Trust%20for%20Ornithology\"&gt;British Trust for Ornithology&lt;/a&gt; (BTO), an organization for the study of &lt;a href=\"birds\"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; in the British Isles.\nOn his death in 1937, his museum and all of its contents were given in his will to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; (of which the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London\"&gt;Natural History Museum, London&lt;/a&gt; was then a part), the greatest accession that the institution has ever received. The &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Rothschild%20Zoological%20Museum\"&gt;Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tring\"&gt;Tring&lt;/a&gt; is now a division of the Natural History Museum.\nFollowing a visit to Hungary in 1902, Rothschild brought six live edible dormice (\"&lt;a href=\"Glis%20glis\"&gt;Glis glis&lt;/a&gt;\") back to &lt;a href=\"Tring\"&gt;Tring&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them escaped and started breeding successfully in the wild. They have now become a localized pest over an area of approximately 200 square miles in a triangle between Luton, Aylesbury and Beaconsfield, and there are estimated to be at least 10,000 of them. Even though considered an &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;, they are protected under the &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20and%20Countryside%20Act%201981\"&gt;Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981&lt;/a&gt;.\nRothschild was awarded an honorary doctorate by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Giessen\"&gt;University of Giessen&lt;/a&gt; in 1898, was elected a Trustee of the British Museum in 1899 and was elected a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1911.\nPolitical career.\nWalter Rothschild was a &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aylesbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Aylesbury&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1899%20Aylesbury%20by-election\"&gt;1899&lt;/a&gt; until he retired from politics at the &lt;a href=\"January%201910%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;January 1910 general election&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary activities.\nDespite his health, Rothschild served part-time as an officer in a &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Territorial Army&lt;/a&gt; unit, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Buckinghamshire%20Yeomanry\"&gt;Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28BARM%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; from July 1902, promoted to &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28British%20Army%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in 1903 and retiring in 1909.\nZionism and Balfour Declaration.\nAs an active &lt;a href=\"Zionist\"&gt;Zionist&lt;/a&gt; and a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Chaim%20Weizmann\"&gt;Chaim Weizmann&lt;/a&gt;, he worked to formulate the draft declaration for a Jewish homeland in &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 November 1917, he received a letter from the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs\"&gt;British foreign secretary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Balfour\"&gt;Arthur Balfour&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to his London home at 148 &lt;a href=\"Piccadilly\"&gt;Piccadilly&lt;/a&gt;. In the letter, the British government declared its support for the establishment in Palestine of \"a national home for the Jewish people\". The letter became known as the &lt;a href=\"Balfour%20Declaration\"&gt;Balfour Declaration&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeerage.\nWalter inherited the British peerage title \"&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rothschild\"&gt;Baron Rothschild&lt;/a&gt;\" from his father &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Mayer%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild\"&gt;Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; in 1915. He died in 1937 at Tring Park, &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, aged 69, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"Willesden%20Jewish%20Cemetery\"&gt;Willesden Jewish Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, London. He had no legitimate children and his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Rothschild\"&gt;Charles Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; had predeceased him, so the title was inherited by his nephew (Nathaniel Mayer) &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Rothschild\"&gt;Victor Rothschild&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurthermore, he also inherited the title \"Baron de Rothschild\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Freiherr\"&gt;Freiherr&lt;/a&gt; von Rothschild\") of the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20nobility\"&gt;Austrian nobility&lt;/a&gt;, which was an authorized title in the United Kingdom by Warrant of 27 April 1932.\nIn 1838, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; had authorized the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom.\nPublications.\nRothschild is the author of around 765 publications. Of these 27 were co-authored with &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Hartert\"&gt;Ernst Hartert&lt;/a&gt; and 16 with Karl Jordan. He published 278 articles in the \"&lt;a href=\"Bulletin%20of%20the%20British%20Ornithologists%27%20Club\"&gt;Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club&lt;/a&gt;\" and 318 articles in the \"&lt;a href=\"Novitates%20Zoologicae\"&gt;Novitates Zoologicae&lt;/a&gt;\", a journal which he established in 1894 with himself, Hartert and Jordan as editors.\nHis publication include:\nExternal links.\nof the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;"
