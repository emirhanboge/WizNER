    "text": "Into the Wild is a 1996 non-fiction book written by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Krakauer\"&gt;Jon Krakauer&lt;/a&gt;. It is an expansion of a 9,000-word article by Krakauer on &lt;a href=\"Chris%20McCandless\"&gt;Chris McCandless&lt;/a&gt; titled \"Death of an Innocent\", which appeared in the January 1993 issue of \"&lt;a href=\"Outside%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Outside&lt;/a&gt;\". The book was adapted to &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Wild%20%28film%29\"&gt;a film of the same name&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, directed by &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Penn\"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Hirsch\"&gt;Emile Hirsch&lt;/a&gt; starring as McCandless. \"Into the Wild\" is an international bestseller which has been printed in 30 languages and 173 editions and formats. The book is widely used as high school and college reading curriculum. \"Into the Wild\" has been lauded by many reviewers, and in 2019 was listed by \"&lt;a href=\"Slate%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;\" as one of the 50 best nonfiction works of the past quarter-century, but the book has also been described by Alaskan reporter Craig Medred as \"something invented\" by its author.\nBackground.\nChristopher Johnson McCandless grew up in suburban &lt;a href=\"Annandale%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Annandale, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. After graduating in May 1990 with high grades from &lt;a href=\"Emory%20University\"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;, McCandless ceased communicating with his family, gave away his college fund of $24,500 to &lt;a href=\"Oxfam\"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt;, and began traveling across the &lt;a href=\"Western%20United%20States\"&gt;Western United States&lt;/a&gt;, later abandoning his 1982 &lt;a href=\"Datsun%20B210\"&gt;Datsun B210&lt;/a&gt; after a &lt;a href=\"flash%20flood\"&gt;flash flood&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 28, 1992, McCandless hitchhiked to the &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20Trail\"&gt;Stampede Trail&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. There he headed down the snow-covered trail to begin an odyssey with only 10 pounds (4500 g) of rice, a &lt;a href=\"Remington%20Nylon%2066\"&gt;.22 caliber rifle&lt;/a&gt;, several boxes of rifle rounds, a camera, and a small selection of reading material\u2014including a field guide to the region's edible plants, \"Tana'ina Plantlore\". He declined an acquaintance's offer to buy him sturdier clothing and better supplies. McCandless perished sometime around the week of August 18, 1992, after surviving for 113 days.\nSummary.\nOn September 6, 1992, Christopher McCandless's body was found in an abandoned bus at on the &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20Trail\"&gt;Stampede Trail&lt;/a&gt; in Alaska. One year later, author Jon Krakauer retraced McCandless's steps during the two years between college graduation and his demise in Alaska. McCandless shed his legal name early in his journey, adopting the moniker \"Alexander Supertramp\", after &lt;a href=\"W.H.%20Davies\"&gt;W.H. Davies&lt;/a&gt;. He spent time in &lt;a href=\"Carthage%2C%20South%20Dakota\"&gt;Carthage, South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, laboring for months in a &lt;a href=\"grain%20elevator\"&gt;grain elevator&lt;/a&gt; owned by Wayne Westerberg before hitchhiking to Alaska in April 1992. Krakauer interprets McCandless's intensely &lt;a href=\"Asceticism\"&gt;ascetic&lt;/a&gt; personality as possibly influenced by the writings of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20David%20Thoreau\"&gt;Henry David Thoreau&lt;/a&gt; and McCandless's favorite writer, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20London\"&gt;Jack London&lt;/a&gt;. He explores the similarities between McCandless's experiences and motivations, and his own as a young man, recounting in detail Krakauer's own attempt to climb &lt;a href=\"Devils%20Thumb\"&gt;Devils Thumb&lt;/a&gt; in Alaska. Krakauer also relates the stories of some other young men who vanished into the wilderness, such as &lt;a href=\"Everett%20Ruess\"&gt;Everett Ruess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20McCunn\"&gt;Carl McCunn&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he describes at some length the grief and puzzlement of McCandless's parents, sister Carine, and friends.\nCause of death.\nMcCandless survived for approximately 113 days in the &lt;a href=\"Alaskan\"&gt;Alaskan&lt;/a&gt; wilderness, &lt;a href=\"foraging\"&gt;foraging&lt;/a&gt; for edible roots and berries, shooting an assortment of &lt;a href=\"game%20%28food%29\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;\u2014including a &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and keeping a &lt;a href=\"Diary\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. Although he planned to &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hike&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"coast\"&gt;coast&lt;/a&gt;, the boggy &lt;a href=\"terrain\"&gt;terrain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"summer\"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; proved too difficult, and he decided instead to camp in a derelict &lt;a href=\"camping\"&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bus\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; left behind by a road &lt;a href=\"construction\"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"company\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;. In July he tried to leave, only to find the route blocked by the &lt;a href=\"Teklanika%20River\"&gt;Teklanika river&lt;/a&gt; raging with snow-melt. On July 30, McCandless wrote a journal entry which read, \"Extremely Weak. Fault Of Pot[ato] Seed\". Based on this entry, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless had been eating what he thought was the roots of an edible plant, \"&lt;a href=\"Hedysarum%20alpinum\"&gt;Hedysarum alpinum&lt;/a&gt;\", commonly known as wild &lt;a href=\"Eskimo%20potato\"&gt;Eskimo potato&lt;/a&gt;, which are sweet and nourishing in the spring but become too tough to eat in the summer, perhaps forcing McCandless to eat the H. alpinum's seeds instead. Krakauer first speculated that the seeds were actually from \"&lt;a href=\"Hedysarum%20mackenzii\"&gt;Hedysarum mackenzii&lt;/a&gt;\", or wild sweet pea, instead of the Eskimo potato, which contained a poisonous &lt;a href=\"alkaloid\"&gt;alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;, possibly &lt;a href=\"swainsonine\"&gt;swainsonine&lt;/a&gt; (the toxic chemical in &lt;a href=\"locoweed\"&gt;locoweed&lt;/a&gt;) or something similar. In addition to neurological symptoms, such as weakness and loss of coordination, the poison causes &lt;a href=\"starvation\"&gt;starvation&lt;/a&gt; by blocking nutrient metabolism in the body. However, Krakauer later suggested that McCandless had not confused the two plants and had in fact actually eaten \"H. alpinum\". Krakauer had the \"H. alpinum\" seeds tested for toxins and, through tests on \"Hendysarum alpinum\", it was discovered that it contained an unidentifiable form of toxin.\nAccording to Krakauer, a well-nourished person might consume the seeds and survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless was likely unable to fend off the toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Alaska%20Fairbanks\"&gt;University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety \"&lt;a href=\"Rhizoctonia%20leguminicola\"&gt;Rhizoctonia leguminicola&lt;/a&gt;\" may have caused McCandless's death. \"Rhizoctonia leguminicola\" is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have contributed to McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable to get out of bed and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.\nIn March 2015, Krakauer co-authored a scientific analysis of the \"Hedysarum alpinum\" seeds McCandless ate. The report found relatively high levels of L-&lt;a href=\"canavanine\"&gt;canavanine&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"antimetabolite\"&gt;antimetabolite&lt;/a&gt; toxic to mammals) in the \"H. alpinum\" seeds and concluded \"it is highly likely that the consumption of H. alpinum seeds contributed to the death of Chris McCandless.\"\nMajor themes.\n\"Into the Wild\" addresses the issues of how to be accepted into society, and how finding oneself sometimes conflicts with being an active member in &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. Most critics agree that Chris McCandless left to find some sort of &lt;a href=\"Enlightenment%20%28spiritual%29\"&gt;enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;. He also tries to find his way in the wild with minimal material possessions, because \"it made the journey more enjoyable.\" His extreme risk-taking was the calling which eventually led to his downfall.\nMcCandless was influenced by &lt;a href=\"transcendentalism\"&gt;transcendentalism&lt;/a&gt; and the need to \"revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.\"\nAdaptations.\nA film adaptation was released in September 2007, directed by &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Penn\"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt; and starring &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Hirsch\"&gt;Emile Hirsch&lt;/a&gt; as McCandless.\nMcCandless's story is also the subject of the documentary by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Lamothe\"&gt;Ron Lamothe&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild%20%282007%20film%29\"&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;\" (2007). In his study of McCandless's death, Lamothe concludes that McCandless ran out of supplies and game, and starved to death, instead of being poisoned by eating the seeds of the wild potato.\nThe Christopher Johnson McCandless Memorial Foundation, headed by McCandless's parents Bille and Walt, with the editorial and writing input of family and friends, released the book and DVD \"Back to the Wild: The Photographs &amp; Writings of Christopher McCandless\" (2010). The material includes hundreds of McCandless's previously unseen pictures and journal entries. Jon Krakauer has written a piece in the book's introduction, while &lt;a href=\"Hal%20Holbrook\"&gt;Hal Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who appeared in the Penn film\u2014narrates the DVD.\nBus exhibit.\nThe bus that McCandless died in became a tourist attraction after the book became popular. The bus was removed on June 18, 2020 because tourists were endangering themselves in the Alaskan wilderness. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Alaska%20National%20Guard\"&gt;Alaska National Guard&lt;/a&gt; airlifted the bus to an undisclosed location, and then on September 24, 2020, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Alaska%20Museum%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;University of Alaska Museum of the North&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; announced the permanent display of the bus."
