    "text": "OS/2 (Operating System/2) is a series of computer &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s, initially created by &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of IBM software designer &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Iacobucci\"&gt;Ed Iacobucci&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft's new &lt;a href=\"Windows%203.1\"&gt;Windows 3.1&lt;/a&gt; operating environment, the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively. The name stands for \"Operating System/2\", because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's \"&lt;a href=\"IBM%20Personal%20System/2\"&gt;Personal System/2&lt;/a&gt; (PS/2)\" line of second-generation &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer\"&gt;personal computer&lt;/a&gt;s. The first version of OS/2 was released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001.\nOS/2 was intended as a &lt;a href=\"protected%20mode\"&gt;protected-mode&lt;/a&gt; successor of &lt;a href=\"IBM%20PC%20DOS\"&gt;PC\u00a0DOS&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, basic &lt;a href=\"system%20call\"&gt;system call&lt;/a&gt;s were modeled after &lt;a href=\"MS-DOS\"&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/a&gt; calls; their names even started with \"Dos\" and it was possible to create \"Family Mode\" applications \u2013 &lt;a href=\"text%20mode\"&gt;text mode&lt;/a&gt; applications that could work on both systems. Because of this heritage, OS/2 shares similarities with &lt;a href=\"Unix\"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xenix\"&gt;Xenix&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Windows%20NT\"&gt;Windows NT&lt;/a&gt;.\nIBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on 31 December 2006. Since then, OS/2 has been developed, supported and sold by two different third-party vendors under license from IBM \u2013 first by Serenity Systems as &lt;a href=\"eComStation\"&gt;eComStation&lt;/a&gt; since 2001, and later by Arca Noae LLC as &lt;a href=\"ArcaOS\"&gt;ArcaOS&lt;/a&gt; since 2017.\nDevelopment history.\n1985\u20131989: Joint development.\nThe development of OS/2 began when IBM and Microsoft signed the \"Joint Development Agreement\" in August 1985. It was code-named \"CP/DOS\" and it took two years for the first product to be delivered.\nOS/2 1.0 was announced in April 1987 and released in December. The original release is &lt;a href=\"textmode\"&gt;textmode&lt;/a&gt;-only, and a GUI was introduced with OS/2 1.1 about a year later. OS/2 features an &lt;a href=\"Application%20programming%20interface\"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; for controlling the &lt;a href=\"display%20device\"&gt;video display&lt;/a&gt; (VIO) and handling &lt;a href=\"computer%20keyboard\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and mouse events so that programmers writing for &lt;a href=\"Protected%20Mode\"&gt;protected-mode&lt;/a&gt; need not call the &lt;a href=\"BIOS\"&gt;BIOS&lt;/a&gt; or access hardware directly. Other development tools included a subset of the video and keyboard APIs as linkable libraries so that family mode programs are able to run under MS-DOS, and, in the OS/2 Extended Edition v1.0, a database engine called Database Manager or DBM (this was related to &lt;a href=\"DB2\"&gt;DB2&lt;/a&gt;, and should not be confused with the &lt;a href=\"DBM%20%28computing%29\"&gt;DBM&lt;/a&gt; family of database engines for Unix and &lt;a href=\"Unix-like\"&gt;Unix-like&lt;/a&gt; operating systems). A task-switcher named Program Selector was available through the Ctrl-Esc &lt;a href=\"hotkey\"&gt;hotkey&lt;/a&gt; combination, allowing the user to select among multitasked text-mode sessions (or screen groups; each can run multiple programs).\nCommunications and database-oriented extensions were delivered in 1988, as part of OS/2 1.0 Extended Edition: &lt;a href=\"Systems%20Network%20Architecture\"&gt;SNA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"X.25\"&gt;X.25&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Program-to-Program%20Communication\"&gt;APPC&lt;/a&gt;/LU 6.2, &lt;a href=\"LAN%20Manager\"&gt;LAN Manager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Query%20Management%20Facility\"&gt;Query Manager&lt;/a&gt;, SQL.\nThe promised user interface, &lt;a href=\"Presentation%20Manager\"&gt;Presentation Manager&lt;/a&gt;, was introduced with OS/2 1.1 in October 1988. It had a similar user interface to &lt;a href=\"Windows%202.1x\"&gt;Windows 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, which was released in May of that year. (The interface was replaced in versions 1.2 and 1.3 by a look closer in appearance to &lt;a href=\"Windows%203.0\"&gt;Windows 3.0&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Extended Edition of 1.1, sold only through IBM sales channels, introduced distributed database support to IBM database systems and SNA communications support to IBM mainframe networks.\nIn 1989, Version 1.2 introduced Installable Filesystems and, notably, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Performance%20File%20System\"&gt;HPFS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"File%20system\"&gt;filesystem&lt;/a&gt;. HPFS provided a number of improvements over the older &lt;a href=\"File%20Allocation%20Table\"&gt;FAT&lt;/a&gt; file system, including long filenames and a form of &lt;a href=\"Fork%20%28file%20system%29\"&gt;alternate data streams&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Extended%20Attributes\"&gt;Extended Attributes&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, extended attributes were also added to the FAT file system.\nThe Extended Edition of 1.2 introduced &lt;a href=\"Internet%20protocol%20suite\"&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ethernet\"&gt;Ethernet&lt;/a&gt; support.\nOS/2- and Windows-related books of the late 1980s acknowledged the existence of both systems and promoted OS/2 as the system of the future.\n1990: Breakup.\nThe collaboration between IBM and Microsoft unravelled in 1990, between the releases of &lt;a href=\"Windows%203.0\"&gt;Windows 3.0&lt;/a&gt; and OS/2 1.3. During this time, Windows 3.0 became a tremendous success, selling millions of copies in its first year. Much of its success was because Windows 3.0 (along with MS-DOS) was bundled with most new computers. OS/2, on the other hand, was available only as an additional stand-alone software package. In addition, OS/2 lacked &lt;a href=\"device%20driver\"&gt;device driver&lt;/a&gt;s for many common devices such as printers, particularly non-IBM hardware. Windows, on the other hand, supported a much larger variety of hardware. The increasing popularity of Windows prompted Microsoft to shift its development focus from cooperating on OS/2 with IBM to building its own business based on Windows.\nSeveral technical and practical reasons contributed to this breakup.\nThe two companies had significant differences in culture and vision. Microsoft favored the open hardware system approach that contributed to its success on the PC. IBM sought to use OS/2 to drive sales of its own hardware, and urged Microsoft to drop features, such as &lt;a href=\"Computer%20font\"&gt;fonts&lt;/a&gt;, that IBM's hardware did not support. Microsoft programmers also became frustrated with IBM's bureaucracy and its use of &lt;a href=\"Source%20lines%20of%20code\"&gt;lines of code&lt;/a&gt; to measure &lt;a href=\"programmer%20productivity\"&gt;programmer productivity&lt;/a&gt;. IBM developers complained about the terseness and lack of &lt;a href=\"comment%20%28computing%29\"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft's code, while Microsoft developers complained that IBM's code was &lt;a href=\"code%20bloat\"&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe two products have significant differences in API. OS/2 was announced when &lt;a href=\"Windows%202.0\"&gt;Windows 2.0&lt;/a&gt; was near completion, and the &lt;a href=\"Windows%20API\"&gt;Windows API&lt;/a&gt; already defined. However, IBM requested that this API be significantly changed for OS/2. Therefore, issues surrounding application compatibility appeared immediately. OS/2 designers hoped for source code conversion tools, allowing complete migration of Windows application source code to OS/2 at some point. However, OS/2 1.x did not gain enough momentum to allow vendors to avoid developing for both OS/2 and Windows in parallel.\nOS/2 1.x targets the &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080286\"&gt;Intel 80286&lt;/a&gt; processor and DOS fundamentally doesn't. IBM insisted on supporting the 80286 processor, with its 16-bit &lt;a href=\"x86%20memory%20segmentation\"&gt;segmented memory&lt;/a&gt; mode, because of commitments made to customers who had purchased many 80286-based PS/2s as a result of IBM's promises surrounding OS/2. Until release 2.0 in April 1992, OS/2 ran in 16-bit &lt;a href=\"protected%20mode\"&gt;protected mode&lt;/a&gt; and therefore could not benefit from the &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080386\"&gt;Intel 80386&lt;/a&gt;'s much simpler &lt;a href=\"32-bit%20computing\"&gt;32-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flat%20memory%20model\"&gt;flat memory model&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"virtual%208086%20mode\"&gt;virtual 8086 mode&lt;/a&gt; features. This was especially painful in providing support for DOS applications. While, in 1988, &lt;a href=\"Windows%202.1x\"&gt;Windows/386 2.1&lt;/a&gt; could run several &lt;a href=\"cooperative%20multitasking\"&gt;cooperatively multitasked&lt;/a&gt; DOS applications, including &lt;a href=\"expanded%20memory\"&gt;expanded memory&lt;/a&gt; (EMS) emulation, OS/2 1.3, released in 1991, was still limited to one \"DOS box\".\nGiven these issues, Microsoft started to work in parallel on a version of Windows which was more future-oriented and more portable. The hiring of &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Cutler\"&gt;Dave Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"OpenVMS\"&gt;VAX/VMS&lt;/a&gt; architect, in 1988 created an immediate competition with the OS/2 team, as Cutler did not think much of the OS/2 technology and wanted to build on his work on the &lt;a href=\"DEC%20MICA\"&gt;MICA&lt;/a&gt; project at &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation\"&gt;Digital&lt;/a&gt; rather than creating a \"DOS plus\". His &lt;a href=\"Windows%20NT\"&gt;NT OS/2&lt;/a&gt; was a completely new architecture.\nIBM grew concerned about the delays in development of OS/2 2.0. Initially, the companies agreed that IBM would take over maintenance of OS/2 1.0 and development of OS/2 2.0, while Microsoft would continue development of OS/2 3.0. In the end, Microsoft decided to recast NT OS/2 3.0 as &lt;a href=\"Windows%20NT\"&gt;Windows NT&lt;/a&gt;, leaving all future OS/2 development to IBM. From a business perspective, it was logical to concentrate on a consumer line of operating systems based on DOS and Windows, and to prepare a new high-end system in such a way as to keep good compatibility with existing Windows applications. While it waited for this new high-end system to develop, Microsoft would still receive licensing money from Xenix and OS/2 sales. Windows NT's OS/2 heritage can be seen in its initial support for the &lt;a href=\"HPFS%20filesystem\"&gt;HPFS filesystem&lt;/a&gt;, text mode OS/2 1.x applications, and OS/2 LAN Manager network support. Some early NT materials even included OS/2 copyright notices embedded in the software.\nOne example of NT OS/2 1.x support is in the WIN2K resource kit. Windows NT could also support OS/2 1.x &lt;a href=\"Presentation%20Manager\"&gt;Presentation Manager&lt;/a&gt; and AVIO applications with the addition of the Windows NT Add-On Subsystem for Presentation Manager.\n1992: 32-bit era.\nOS/2 2.0 was released in April 1992. At the time, the suggested retail price was U.S. $195, while Windows retailed for $150.\nOS/2 2.0 provided a 32-bit API for native programs, though the OS itself still contained some 16-bit code and drivers. It also included a new OOUI (object-oriented user interface) called the &lt;a href=\"Workplace%20Shell\"&gt;Workplace Shell&lt;/a&gt;. This was a fully object-oriented interface that was a significant departure from the previous GUI. Rather than merely providing an environment for program windows (such as the Program Manager), the Workplace Shell provided an environment in which the user could manage programs, files and devices by manipulating objects on the screen. With the Workplace Shell, everything in the system is an \"object\" to be manipulated.\nDOS compatibility.\nOS/2 2.0 was touted by IBM as \"a better DOS than DOS and a better Windows than Windows\". It managed this by including the fully-licensed MS-DOS 5.0, which had been patched and improved upon. For the first time, OS/2 was able to run more than one DOS application at a time. This was so effective, that it allowed OS/2 to run a modified copy of Windows 3.0, itself a &lt;a href=\"DOS%20extender\"&gt;DOS extender&lt;/a&gt;, including Windows 3.0 applications.\nBecause of the limitations of the &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080286\"&gt;Intel 80286&lt;/a&gt; processor, OS/2 1.x could run only one DOS program at a time, and did this in a way that allowed the DOS program to have total control over the computer. A problem in DOS mode could crash the entire computer. In contrast, OS/2 2.0 could leverage the &lt;a href=\"virtual%208086%20mode\"&gt;virtual 8086 mode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080386\"&gt;Intel 80386&lt;/a&gt; processor to create a much safer &lt;a href=\"virtual%20machine\"&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; in which to run DOS programs. This included an extensive set of configuration options to optimize the performance and capabilities given to each DOS program. Any real-mode operating system (such as 8086 &lt;a href=\"Xenix\"&gt;Xenix&lt;/a&gt;) could also be made to run using OS/2's virtual machine capabilities, subject to certain direct hardware access limitations.\nLike most 32-bit environments, OS/2 could not run protected-mode DOS programs using the older &lt;a href=\"VCPI\"&gt;VCPI&lt;/a&gt; interface, unlike the Standard mode of Windows 3.1; it only supported programs written according to &lt;a href=\"DOS%20Protected%20Mode%20Interface\"&gt;DPMI&lt;/a&gt;. (Microsoft discouraged the use of VCPI under Windows 3.1, however, due to performance degradation.)\nUnlike Windows NT, OS/2 always allowed DOS programs the possibility of masking real hardware interrupts, so any DOS program could &lt;a href=\"deadlock\"&gt;deadlock&lt;/a&gt; the machine in this way. OS/2 could, however, use a hardware &lt;a href=\"non-maskable%20interrupt\"&gt;watchdog&lt;/a&gt; on selected machines (notably IBM machines) to break out of such a deadlock. Later, release 3.0 leveraged the enhancements of newer &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080486\"&gt;Intel 80486&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Original%20Intel%20Pentium%20%28P5%20microarchitecture%29\"&gt;Intel Pentium&lt;/a&gt; processors\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Interrupt%20Flag\"&gt;Virtual Interrupt Flag&lt;/a&gt; (VIF), which was part of the &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Mode%20Extensions\"&gt;Virtual Mode Extensions&lt;/a&gt; (VME)\u2014to solve this problem.\nWindows 3.x compatibility.\nCompatibility with Windows 3.0 (and later Windows 3.1) was achieved by adapting Windows user-mode code components to run inside a &lt;a href=\"virtual%20DOS%20machine\"&gt;virtual DOS machine&lt;/a&gt; (VDM). Originally, a nearly complete version of Windows code was included with OS/2 itself: Windows 3.0 in OS/2 2.0, and Windows 3.1 in OS/2 2.1. Later, IBM developed versions of OS/2 that would use whatever Windows version the user had installed previously, patching it on the fly, and sparing the cost of an additional Windows license. It could either run full-screen, using its own set of video drivers, or \"seamlessly,\" where Windows programs would appear directly on the OS/2 desktop. The process containing Windows was given fairly extensive access to hardware, especially video, and the result was that switching between a full-screen WinOS/2 session and the Workplace Shell could occasionally cause issues.\nBecause OS/2 only runs the user-mode system components of Windows, it is incompatible with Windows device drivers (&lt;a href=\"VxD\"&gt;VxD&lt;/a&gt;s) and applications that require them.\nMultiple Windows applications run by default in a single Windows session \u2013 multitasking cooperatively and without memory protection \u2013 just as they would under native Windows 3.x. However, to achieve true isolation between Windows 3.x programs, OS/2 can also run multiple copies of Windows in parallel, with each copy residing in a separate VDM. The user can then optionally place each program either in its own Windows session \u2013 with preemptive multitasking and full memory protection \"between\" sessions, though not \"within\" them \u2013 or allow some applications to run together cooperatively in a shared Windows session while isolating other applications in one or more separate Windows sessions. At the cost of additional hardware resources, this approach can protect each program in any given Windows session (and each instance of Windows itself) from every other program running in any \"separate\" Windows session (though not from other programs running in the same Windows session).\nWhether Windows applications are running in full-screen or windowed mode, and in one Windows session or several, it is possible to use &lt;a href=\"Dynamic%20Data%20Exchange\"&gt;DDE&lt;/a&gt; between OS/2 and Windows applications, and &lt;a href=\"Object%20Linking%20and%20Embedding\"&gt;OLE&lt;/a&gt; between Windows applications only.\n1994: OS/2 Warp.\nReleased in 1994, OS/2 version 3.0 was labelled as OS/2 Warp to highlight the new performance benefits, and generally to freshen the product image. \"Warp\" had originally been the internal IBM name for the release: IBM claimed that it had used \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Trek\"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;\" terms as internal names for prior OS/2 releases, and that this one seemed appropriate for external use as well. At the launch of OS/2 Warp in 1994, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Stewart\"&gt;Patrick Stewart&lt;/a&gt; was to be the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Ceremonies\"&gt;Master of Ceremonies&lt;/a&gt;; however &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Mulgrew\"&gt;Kate Mulgrew&lt;/a&gt; of the then-upcoming series \"\" substituted him at the last minute.\nOS/2 Warp offers a host of benefits over OS/2 2.1, notably broader hardware support, greater multimedia capabilities, &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;-compatible networking, and it includes a basic office application suite known as &lt;a href=\"IBM%20Works\"&gt;IBM Works&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in two versions: the less expensive \"Red Spine\" and the more expensive \"Blue Spine\" (named for the color of their boxes). \"Red Spine\" was designed to support &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Windows\"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; applications by utilizing any existing installation of Windows on the computer's hard drive. \"Blue Spine\" includes Windows support in its own installation, and so can support Windows applications without a Windows installation. As most computers were sold with Microsoft Windows pre-installed and the price was less, \"Red Spine\" was the more popular product. OS/2 Warp Connect\u2014which has full LAN client support built-in\u2014followed in mid-1995. Warp Connect was nicknamed \"Grape\".\nIn OS/2 2.0, most performance-sensitive subsystems, including the graphics (Gre) and multimedia (MMPM/2) systems, were updated to 32-bit code in a fixpack, and included as part of OS/2 2.1. Warp 3 brought about a fully 32-bit windowing system, while Warp 4 introduced the object-oriented 32-bit GRADD display driver model.\n1996: Warp 4.\nIn 1996, Warp 4 added &lt;a href=\"Java%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"speech%20recognition\"&gt;speech recognition&lt;/a&gt; software. IBM also released server editions of Warp 3 and Warp 4 which bundled IBM's LAN Server product directly into the operating system installation. A personal version of &lt;a href=\"IBM%20Notes\"&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt; was also included, with a number of template databases for contact management, brainstorming, and so forth. The UK-distributed free demo &lt;a href=\"CD-ROM\"&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/a&gt; of OS/2 Warp essentially contained the entire OS and was easily, even accidentally, &lt;a href=\"Software%20cracking\"&gt;cracked&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that even people who liked it did not have to buy it. This was seen as a backdoor tactic to increase the number of OS/2 users, in the belief that this would increase sales and demand for third-party applications, and thus strengthen OS/2's desktop numbers. This suggestion was bolstered by the fact that this demo version had replaced another which was not so easily cracked, but which had been released with trial versions of various applications. In 2000, the July edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Australian%20Personal%20Computer\"&gt;Australian Personal Computer&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine bundled software CD-ROMs, included a full version of Warp 4 that required no activation and was essentially a free release. Special versions of OS/2 2.11 and Warp 4 also included &lt;a href=\"symmetric%20multiprocessing\"&gt;symmetric multiprocessing&lt;/a&gt; (SMP) support.\nOS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals; however, by the early 1990s, it was overtaken by Microsoft &lt;a href=\"Windows%20NT\"&gt;Windows NT&lt;/a&gt;. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Microsoft &lt;a href=\"Windows%2095\"&gt;Windows 95&lt;/a&gt;, OS/2 failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and stand-alone desktop PC segments; there were reports that it could not be installed properly on IBM's own &lt;a href=\"IBM%20Aptiva\"&gt;Aptiva&lt;/a&gt; series of home PCs. Microsoft made an offer in 1994 where IBM would receive the same terms as &lt;a href=\"Compaq\"&gt;Compaq&lt;/a&gt; (the largest PC manufacturer at the time) for a license of Windows 95, if IBM ended development of OS/2 completely. IBM refused and instead went with an \"IBM First\" strategy of promoting OS/2 Warp and disparaging Windows, as IBM aimed to drive sales of its own software as well as hardware. By 1995, Windows 95 negotiations between IBM and Microsoft, which were already difficult, stalled when IBM purchased &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20SmartSuite\"&gt;Lotus SmartSuite&lt;/a&gt;, which would have directly competed with &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Office\"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the dispute, IBM signed the license agreement 15 minutes before Microsoft's Windows 95 launch event, which was later than their competitors and this badly hurt sales of IBM PCs. IBM officials later conceded that OS/2 would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the PC business.\nWorkplace OS.\nIn 1991, IBM started development on an intended replacement for OS/2 called &lt;a href=\"Workplace%20OS\"&gt;Workplace OS&lt;/a&gt;. This was an entirely new product, brand new code, that borrowed only a few sections of code from both the existing OS/2 and AIX products. It used an entirely new microkernel code base, intended (eventually) to host several of IBM's operating systems (including OS/2) as microkernel \"personalities\". It also included major new architectural features including a system registry, JFS, support for UNIX graphics libraries, and a new driver model.\nWorkplace OS was developed solely for &lt;a href=\"PowerPC\"&gt;POWER platforms&lt;/a&gt;, and IBM intended to market a full line of PowerPCs in an effort to take over the market from &lt;a href=\"Intel\"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;. A mission was formed to create prototypes of these machines and they were disclosed to several corporate customers, all of whom raised issues with the idea of dropping Intel.\nAdvanced plans for the new code base would eventually include replacement of the &lt;a href=\"OS/400\"&gt;OS/400&lt;/a&gt; operating system by Workplace OS, as well as a microkernel product that would have been used in industries such as telecommunications and set-top television receivers.\nA partially functional pre-alpha version of Workplace OS was demonstrated at Comdex, where a bemused &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Gates\"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; stopped by the booth. The second and last time it would be shown in public was at an OS/2 user group in &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;; the pre-alpha code refused to boot.\nIt was released in 1995. But with $990 million being spent per year on development of this as well as Workplace OS, and no possible profit or widespread adoption, the end of the entire Workplace OS and OS/2 product line was near.\nDownsizing.\nA project was launched internally by IBM to evaluate the looming competitive situation with Microsoft Windows 95. Primary concerns included the major code quality issues in the existing OS/2 product (resulting in over 20 service packs, each requiring more diskettes than the original installation), and the ineffective and heavily matrixed development organization in Boca Raton (where the consultants reported that \"basically, everybody reports to everybody\") and Austin.\nThat study, tightly classified as \"Registered Confidential\" and printed only in numbered copies, identified untenable weaknesses and failures across the board in the Personal Systems Division as well as across IBM as a whole. This resulted in a decision being made at a level above the Division to cut over 95% of the overall budget for the entire product line, end all new development (including Workplace OS), eliminate the Boca Raton development lab, end all sales and marketing efforts of the product, and lay off over 1,300 development individuals (as well as sales and support personnel). $990 million had been spent in the last full year. Warp 4 became the last distributed version of OS/2.\n2001: Fading out.\nA small and dedicated community remained faithful to OS/2 for many years after its final mainstream release, but overall, OS/2 failed to catch on in the mass market and is little used outside certain niches where IBM traditionally had a stronghold. For example, many bank installations, especially &lt;a href=\"automated%20teller%20machine\"&gt;automated teller machine&lt;/a&gt;s, run OS/2 with a customized user interface; French &lt;a href=\"SNCF\"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; national railways used OS/2 1.x in thousands of ticket selling machines. Telecom companies such as &lt;a href=\"Nortel\"&gt;Nortel&lt;/a&gt; used OS/2 in some voicemail systems. Also, OS/2 was used for the host PC used to control the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Radio%20Satellite%20System\"&gt;Satellite Operations Support System&lt;/a&gt; equipment installed at &lt;a href=\"National%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; member stations from 1994 to 2007, and used to receive the network's programming via satellite.\nAlthough IBM began indicating shortly after the release of Warp 4 that OS/2 would eventually be withdrawn, the company did not end support until December 31, 2006. Sales of OS/2 stopped on December 23, 2005. The latest IBM OS/2 Warp version is 4.52, which was released for both desktop and server systems in December 2001.\nIBM is still delivering defect support for a fee. IBM urges customers to migrate their often highly complex applications to &lt;a href=\"Electronic%20business\"&gt;e-business&lt;/a&gt; technologies such as &lt;a href=\"Java%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; in a platform-neutral manner. Once application migration is completed, IBM recommends migration to a different operating system, suggesting &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative.\nThird-party development.\nAfter IBM discontinued development of OS/2, various third parties approached IBM to take over future development of the operating system. The OS/2 software vendor &lt;a href=\"Stardock\"&gt;Stardock&lt;/a&gt; made such a proposal to IBM in 1999, but it was not followed through by the company. Serenity Systems succeeded in negotiating an agreement with IBM, and began reselling OS/2 as eComStation in 2001. eComStation is now sold by XEU.com, the most recent version (2.1) was released in 2011. In 2015, Arca Noae, LLC announced that they had secured an agreement with IBM to resell OS/2. They released the first version of their OS/2-based operating system in 2017 as ArcaOS. As of 2021, there have been multiple releases of ArcaOS, and it remains under active development.\nPetitions for open source.\nMany people hoped that IBM would release OS/2 or a significant part of it as &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. Petitions were held in 2005 and 2007, but IBM refused them, citing legal and technical reasons. It is unlikely that the entire OS will be open at any point in the future because it contains third-party code to which IBM does not have copyright, and much of this code is from &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. IBM also once engaged in a technology transfer with &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20International\"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt;, licensing &lt;a href=\"Amiga\"&gt;Amiga&lt;/a&gt; technology for OS/2 2.0 and above, in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Rexx\"&gt;REXX&lt;/a&gt; scripting language. This means that OS/2 may have some code that was not written by IBM, which can therefore prevent the OS from being re-announced as open-sourced in the future. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; donated &lt;a href=\"Object%20REXX\"&gt;Object REXX&lt;/a&gt; for Windows and OS/2 to the \"Open Object REXX\" project maintained by the \"REXX Language Association\" on &lt;a href=\"SourceForge\"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was a petition, arranged by OS2World, to open parts of the OS. Open source operating systems such as &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; have already profited from OS/2 indirectly through IBM's release of the improved &lt;a href=\"JFS%20%28file%20system%29\"&gt;JFS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"file%20system\"&gt;file system&lt;/a&gt;, which was ported from the OS/2 code base. As IBM didn't release the source of the OS/2 JFS driver, developers ported the Linux driver back to &lt;a href=\"eComStation\"&gt;eComStation&lt;/a&gt; and added the functionality to boot from a JFS partition. This new JFS driver has been integrated into eComStation v2.0, and later into ArcaOS 5.0.\nSummary of releases.\nRelease dates refer to the US English editions unless otherwise noted.\nFeatures and technology.\nUser interface.\nThe graphic system has a layer named Presentation Manager that manages windows, fonts, and icons. This is similar in functionality to a non-networked version of &lt;a href=\"X11\"&gt;X11&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Graphics%20Device%20Interface\"&gt;Windows GDI&lt;/a&gt;. On top of this lies the &lt;a href=\"Workplace%20Shell\"&gt;Workplace Shell&lt;/a&gt; (WPS) introduced in OS/2 2.0. WPS is an &lt;a href=\"object-oriented\"&gt;object-oriented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shell%20%28computers%29\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; allowing the user to perform traditional computing tasks such as accessing files, printers, launching legacy programs, and advanced object oriented tasks using built-in and third-party application objects that extended the shell in an integrated fashion not available on any other mainstream operating system. WPS follows IBM's &lt;a href=\"Common%20User%20Access\"&gt;Common User Access&lt;/a&gt; user interface standards.\nWPS represents objects such as disks, folders, files, program objects, and printers using the &lt;a href=\"System%20Object%20Model\"&gt;System Object Model&lt;/a&gt; (SOM), which allows code to be shared among applications, possibly written in different programming languages. A distributed version called DSOM allowed objects on different computers to communicate. DSOM is based on &lt;a href=\"CORBA\"&gt;CORBA&lt;/a&gt;. The object oriented aspect of SOM is similar to, and a direct competitor to, Microsoft's &lt;a href=\"Component%20Object%20Model\"&gt;Component Object Model&lt;/a&gt;, though it is implemented in a radically different manner; for instance, one of the most notable differences between SOM and COM is SOM's support for inheritance (one of the most fundamental concepts of OO programming)\u2014COM does not have such support. SOM and DSOM are no longer being developed.\nThe multimedia capabilities of OS/2 are accessible through &lt;a href=\"Media%20Control%20Interface\"&gt;Media Control Interface&lt;/a&gt; commands.\nThe last update (bundled with the IBM version of &lt;a href=\"Netscape%20Navigator\"&gt;Netscape Navigator&lt;/a&gt; plugins) added support for &lt;a href=\"MPEG\"&gt;MPEG&lt;/a&gt; files. Support for newer formats such as &lt;a href=\"Portable%20Network%20Graphics\"&gt;PNG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"JPEG\"&gt;progressive JPEG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DivX\"&gt;DivX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogg\"&gt;Ogg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MP3\"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; comes from third parties. Sometimes it is integrated with the multimedia system, but in other offers it comes as standalone applications.\nCommands.\nThe following list of &lt;a href=\"command%20%28computing%29\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; is supported by &lt;a href=\"cmd.exe\"&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/a&gt; on OS/2.\nNetworking.\nThe &lt;a href=\"TCP/IP%20stack\"&gt;TCP/IP stack&lt;/a&gt; is based on the &lt;a href=\"open-source%20software\"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"BSD\"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; stack as visible with &lt;a href=\"Source%20Code%20Control%20System\"&gt;SCCS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Unix%20commands\"&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; compatible tools. IBM included tools such as ftp and telnet and even servers for both commands. IBM sold several networking extensions including NFS support and an X11 server.\nDrivers.\nHardware vendors were reluctant to support device drivers for alternative operating systems including OS/2, leaving users with few choices from a select few vendors. To relieve this issue for video cards, IBM licensed a reduced version of the &lt;a href=\"UniVBE\"&gt;Scitech display drivers&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to choose from a wide selection of cards supported through Scitech's modular driver design.\nVirtualization.\nOS/2 has historically been more difficult to run in a virtual machine than most other legacy &lt;a href=\"x86\"&gt;x86&lt;/a&gt; operating systems because of its extensive reliance on the full set of features of the x86 CPU; in particular, OS/2's use of &lt;a href=\"ring%20%28computer%20security%29\"&gt;ring 2&lt;/a&gt; prevented it from running in early versions of &lt;a href=\"VMware\"&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;. Newer versions of VMware provide official support for OS/2, specifically for eComStation.\n&lt;a href=\"VirtualPC\"&gt;VirtualPC&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; (originally &lt;a href=\"Connectix\"&gt;Connectix&lt;/a&gt;) has been able to run OS/2 without hardware virtualization support for many years. It also provided \"additions\" code which greatly improves host\u2013guest OS interactions in OS/2. The additions are not provided with the current version of VirtualPC, but the version last included with a release may still be used with current releases. At one point, OS/2 was a supported host for VirtualPC in addition to a guest. Note that OS/2 runs only as a guest on those versions of VirtualPC that use virtualization (x86 based hosts) and not those doing full emulation (VirtualPC for Mac).\n&lt;a href=\"VirtualBox\"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Corporation\"&gt;Oracle Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (originally &lt;a href=\"InnoTek\"&gt;InnoTek&lt;/a&gt;, later &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Microsystems\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;) supports OS/2 1.x, Warp 3 through 4.5, and eComStation as well as \"Other OS/2\" as guests. However, attempting to run OS/2 and eComStation can still be difficult, if not impossible, because of the strict requirements of VT-x/AMD-V hardware-enabled virtualization and only ACP2/MCP2 is reported to work in a reliable manner.\nArcaOS supports being run as a &lt;a href=\"virtual%20machine\"&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; guest inside &lt;a href=\"VirtualBox\"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"VMware%20ESXi\"&gt;VMware ESXi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"VMWare%20Workstation\"&gt;VMWare Workstation&lt;/a&gt;. It ships with VirtualBox Guest Additions, and driver improvements to improve performance as a guest operating system.\nThe difficulties in efficiently running OS/2 have, at least once, created an opportunity for a new &lt;a href=\"Platform%20virtualization\"&gt;virtualization&lt;/a&gt; company. A large bank in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; needed a way to use OS/2 on newer hardware that OS/2 did not support. As virtualization software is an easy way around this, the company desired to run OS/2 under a &lt;a href=\"hypervisor\"&gt;hypervisor&lt;/a&gt;. Once it was determined that VMware was not a possibility, it hired a group of Russian software developers to write a host-based hypervisor that would officially support OS/2. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Parallels%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Parallels, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; company and their &lt;a href=\"Parallels%20Workstation\"&gt;Parallels Workstation&lt;/a&gt; product was born.\nSecurity niche.\nOS/2 has few native &lt;a href=\"computer%20virus\"&gt;computer virus&lt;/a&gt;es; while it is not invulnerable by design, its reduced market share appears to have &lt;a href=\"Security%20through%20obsolescence\"&gt;discouraged virus writers&lt;/a&gt;. There are, however, OS/2-based antivirus programs, dealing with DOS viruses and Windows viruses that could pass through an OS/2 server.\nProblems.\nSome problems were classic subjects of comparison with other operating systems:\nHistorical uses.\nOS/2 has been widely used in Iran Export Bank (Bank Saderat Iran) in their teller machines, ATMs and local servers (over 30,000 working stations). As of 2011, the bank moved to virtualize and renew their infrastructure by moving OS/2 to Virtual Machines running over Windows.\nOS/2 was widely used in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian banks. &lt;a href=\"Banco%20do%20Brasil\"&gt;Banco do Brasil&lt;/a&gt; had a peak 10,000 machines running OS/2 Warp in the 1990s. OS/2 was used in &lt;a href=\"automated%20teller%20machine\"&gt;automated teller machine&lt;/a&gt;s until 2006. The workstations and &lt;a href=\"automated%20teller%20machine\"&gt;automated teller machine&lt;/a&gt;s and attendant computers have been migrated to &lt;a href=\"Linux\"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;.\nOS/2 has been used in the banking industry. &lt;a href=\"Suncorp\"&gt;Suncorp&lt;/a&gt; bank in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; still ran its &lt;a href=\"Automated%20teller%20machine\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; network on OS/2 as late as 2002. ATMs at &lt;a href=\"Perisher%20Ski%20Resort\"&gt;Perisher Blue&lt;/a&gt; used OS/2 as late as 2009, and even the turn of the decade.\nOS/2 was widely adopted by &lt;a href=\"accounting\"&gt;accounting&lt;/a&gt; professionals and &lt;a href=\"auditing\"&gt;auditing&lt;/a&gt; companies. In mid-1990s native 32-bit accounting software were well developed and serving corporate markets.\nOS/2 ran the faulty &lt;a href=\"baggage%20handling%20system\"&gt;baggage handling system&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Denver%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Denver International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The OS was eventually scrapped, but the software written for the system led to massive delays in the opening of the new airport. The OS itself was not at fault, but the software written to run on the OS was. The baggage handling system was eventually removed.\nOS/2 was used by radio personality &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Stern\"&gt;Howard Stern&lt;/a&gt;. He once had a 10-minute on-air rant about OS/2 versus &lt;a href=\"Windows%2095\"&gt;Windows 95&lt;/a&gt; and recommended OS/2. He also used OS/2 on his &lt;a href=\"IBM%20ThinkPad%20760\"&gt;IBM 760CD&lt;/a&gt; laptop.\nOS/2 was used as part of the Satellite Operations Support System (SOSS) for &lt;a href=\"NPR\"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Public%20Radio%20Satellite%20System\"&gt;Public Radio Satellite System&lt;/a&gt;. SOSS was a computer-controlled system using OS/2 that NPR member stations used to receive programming feeds via satellite. SOSS was introduced in 1994 using OS/2 3.0, and was retired in 2007, when NPR switched over to its successor, the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Radio%20Satellite%20System%23ContentDepot\"&gt;ContentDepot&lt;/a&gt;.\nOS/2 was used to control the &lt;a href=\"SkyTrain%20%28Vancouver%29\"&gt;SkyTrain&lt;/a&gt; automated light rail system in &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, Canada until the late 2000s when it was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Windows%20XP\"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nOS/2 was used in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20Line%20Extension\"&gt;Jubilee Line Extension&lt;/a&gt; Signals Control System (JLESCS) in London, England. This control system delivered by Alcatel was in use from 1999 to 2011 i.e. between abandonment before opening of the line's unimplemented original automatic train control system and the present &lt;a href=\"SelTrac\"&gt;SelTrac&lt;/a&gt; system. JLESCS did not provide automatic train operation only manual train supervision. Six OS/2 local site computers were distributed along the railway between &lt;a href=\"Stratford%20tube%20station\"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20tube%20station\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, the shunting tower at &lt;a href=\"Stratford%20Market%20Depot\"&gt;Stratford Market Depot&lt;/a&gt;, and several formed the central equipment located at &lt;a href=\"Neasden%20Depot\"&gt;Neasden Depot&lt;/a&gt;. It was once intended to cover the rest of the line between &lt;a href=\"Green%20Park%20tube%20station\"&gt;Green Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stanmore%20tube%20station\"&gt;Stanmore&lt;/a&gt; but this was never introduced.\nOS/2 has been used by &lt;a href=\"The%20Co-operative%20Bank\"&gt;The Co-operative Bank&lt;/a&gt; in the UK for its domestic call centre staff, using a bespoke program created to access customer accounts which cannot easily be migrated to Windows.\nOS/2 has been used by the &lt;a href=\"Stop%20%26amp%3B%20Shop\"&gt;Stop &amp; Shop&lt;/a&gt; supermarket chain (and has been installed in new stores as recently as March 2010).\nOS/2 has been used on ticket machines for &lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;Tramlink&lt;/a&gt; in outer-London.\nOS/2 has been used in &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority\"&gt;New York City's subway system&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"MetroCard\"&gt;MetroCard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRather than interfacing with the user, it connects simple computers and the mainframes.\nWhen NYC MTA finishes its transition to &lt;a href=\"contactless%20payment\"&gt;contactless payment&lt;/a&gt;, OS/2 will be removed.\nOS/2 was used in checkout systems at &lt;a href=\"Safeway%20Inc\"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; supermarkets.\nOS/2 was used by &lt;a href=\"Trenitalia\"&gt;Trenitalia&lt;/a&gt;, both for the desktops at Ticket Counters and for the Automatic Ticket Counters up to 2011. Incidentally, the Automatic Ticket Counters with OS/2 were more reliable than the current ones running a flavor of Windows.\nOS/2 was used as the main operating system for &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20National\"&gt;Abbey National&lt;/a&gt; General Insurance motor and home direct call centre products using the PMSC Series III insurance platform on DB2.2 from 1996-2001.\nAwards.\n\"&lt;a href=\"BYTE\"&gt;BYTE&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1989 listed OS/2 as among the \"Excellence\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it \"is today where the Macintosh was in 1984: It's a development platform in search of developers\". The magazine predicted that \"When it's complete and bug-free, when it can really use the &lt;a href=\"Intel%2080386\"&gt;80386&lt;/a&gt;, and when more desktops sport OS/2-capable PCs, OS/2 will\u2014deservedly\u2014supersede DOS. But even as it stands, OS/2 is a milestone product\".\nIn March 1995 OS/2 won seven awards\nIBM products utilizing OS/2.\nIBM has used OS/2 in a wide variety of hardware products, effectively as a form of &lt;a href=\"embedded%20operating%20system\"&gt;embedded operating system&lt;/a&gt;."
