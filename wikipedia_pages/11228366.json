Coventry City transferred him to Waterford in the summer of 1967 and he stayed with the Blues until 1975. Thomas is associated with bringing a new style of goalkeeping to the League of Ireland. He rarely kicked the ball on the offensive, throwing when possible with great accuracy. He also represented the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland%20XI\"&gt;League of Ireland XI&lt;/a&gt; and won five league medals and a &lt;a href=\"FAI%20Cup\"&gt;FAI Cup&lt;/a&gt; medal and played in 12 European Cup matches for Waterford.\nIn 1975, he moved to the United States where he played for the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Diplomats\"&gt;Washington Diplomats&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%281968%E2%80%931984%29\"&gt;North American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt;.

He returned to the NASL in 1977 with the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Quicksilvers\"&gt;Las Vegas Quicksilvers&lt;/a&gt;. The Diplomats had traded the rights to Thomas and &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20Ingram\"&gt;Gerry Ingram&lt;/a&gt; to the Quicksilver in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Silvester%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Peter Silvester&lt;/a&gt; in November 1976. He finished his North American career with the &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%20Gold%20%281976%E2%80%931980%29\"&gt;Sacramento Gold&lt;/a&gt; of the ASL in 1978. In the fall of 1978, he returned to Ireland where he rejoined &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20F.C.\"&gt;Waterford F.C.&lt;/a&gt;\nNational team.\nBorn in England, Thomas earned two &lt;a href=\"cap%20%28sports%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; after becoming an Irish citizen. He made his debut in 1973 against &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, keeping a clean sheet but having to come off at half time due to a pulled muscle in his stomach. His second cap came against &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in 1974. He was back down in the ASL in 1975, this time with the &lt;a href=\"Sacramento%20Gold%20%281976%E2%80%931980%29\"&gt;Sacramento Gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nManager.\nHe took over as manager of &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Waterford United F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in August 1988 but resigned in December due to work pressures."
