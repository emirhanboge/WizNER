    "text": "The 1930 PGA Championship was the 13th &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Championship\"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, held September 8\u201313 in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meadow%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Fresh Meadow Country Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Flushing%2C%20Queens\"&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;. Then a &lt;a href=\"match%20play\"&gt;match play&lt;/a&gt; championship, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Armour\"&gt;Tommy Armour&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Sarazen\"&gt;Gene Sarazen&lt;/a&gt; 1 up in the finals for the second of his three &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; titles. \n&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Farrell\"&gt;Johnny Farrell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horton%20Smith\"&gt;Horton Smith&lt;/a&gt; were co-medalists at 145 (+5) in the 36-hole &lt;a href=\"stroke%20play\"&gt;stroke play&lt;/a&gt; qualifier on Monday. Two-time defending champion &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Diegel\"&gt;Leo Diegel&lt;/a&gt; lost in the second round to Harold Sampson in 38 holes, ending his bid for a third straight title. Runner-up Sarazen was the club pro at Fresh Meadow; he previously won the PGA Championship in &lt;a href=\"1922%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1923%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 36-hole &lt;a href=\"Monday%20qualifier\"&gt;Monday qualifier&lt;/a&gt;, Diegel shot 81 in the morning round and was in danger of not advancing to match play. He followed up with a 69 (\u20131) in the afternoon and his 150 (+10) put him only five strokes behind the medalists, in a tie for 8th place, easily within the top 32. Starting in &lt;a href=\"1931%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt;, the defending champion was exempt from qualifying.\nThe course where this PGA Championship was played in &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; no longer exists. Designed by &lt;a href=\"A.%20W.%20Tillinghast\"&gt;A. W. Tillinghast&lt;/a&gt;, it opened in 1923 and also hosted the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1932%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1932&lt;/a&gt;, won by Sarazen. Under increasing development and tax pressure, the Fresh Meadow Country Club sold the property in 1946, which was developed as a residential neighborhood (the &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meadows%2C%20Queens\"&gt;Fresh Meadows&lt;/a&gt; section of Queens). The club then purchased the property, clubhouse, and golf course of the defunct Lakeville Golf &amp; Country Club in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Success%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Lake Success&lt;/a&gt;, its current home.\nFormat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"match%20play\"&gt;match play&lt;/a&gt; format at the PGA Championship in 1930 called for 12 rounds (216 holes) in six days:\nFinal results.\n\"Saturday, September 13, 1930\"\nFinal match scorecards.\n\"Morning\"\n\"Afternoon\""
