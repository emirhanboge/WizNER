    "text": "Namcha Barwa or Namchabarwa (; &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u5357\u8fe6\u5df4\u74e6\u5cf0, &lt;a href=\"Pinyin\"&gt;Pinyin&lt;/a&gt;: \"N\u00e1nji\u0101b\u0101w\u01ce F\u0113ng\") is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; peak lying in &lt;a href=\"Tibet%20Autonomous%20Region\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Pemako\"&gt;Pemako&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional definition of the Himalaya extending from the &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt; River to the &lt;a href=\"Brahmaputra\"&gt;Brahmaputra&lt;/a&gt; would make it the eastern anchor of the entire mountain chain, and it is the highest peak of its own &lt;a href=\"Namcha%20barwa%20himal\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; as well as Earth's easternmost peak over . It lies in the &lt;a href=\"Nyingchi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Nyingchi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; of Tibet. It is the highest peak in the 180 km long &lt;a href=\"Namcha%20Barwa%20Himal\"&gt;Namcha Barwa Himal&lt;/a&gt; range (also called the Namjagbarwa &lt;a href=\"Syntaxis%20%28geology%29\"&gt;syntaxis&lt;/a&gt; or Namjagbarwa Group Complex), which is considered the easternmost syntaxis/section of the Himalaya in southeastern Tibet and northeastern India where the Himalaya are said to end, although high ranges (&lt;a href=\"Hengduan%20Mountains\"&gt;Hengduan Mountains&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"China%E2%80%93Myanmar%20border\"&gt;China\u2013Myanmar border&lt;/a&gt;) actually continue another 300\u00a0km east.\nLocation.\nNamcha Barwa is in an isolated part of southeastern Tibet rarely visited by outsiders. It stands inside the \"Great Bend\" of the &lt;a href=\"Yarlung%20Tsangpo%20River%20%28Tibet%29\"&gt;Yarlung Tsangpo River&lt;/a&gt; as the river enters its notable &lt;a href=\"Yarlung%20Tsangpo%20Grand%20Canyon\"&gt;gorge&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalaya&lt;/a&gt;, emerging as the \"Siang\" and becoming the &lt;a href=\"Brahmaputra\"&gt;Brahmaputra&lt;/a&gt;. Namcha Barwa's sister peak \"&lt;a href=\"Gyala%20Peri\"&gt;Gyala Peri&lt;/a&gt;\" at rises across the gorge to the NNW.\nNotable features.\nNamcha rises above the Yarlung Tsangpo. After \"&lt;a href=\"Batura%20Sar\"&gt;Batura Sar&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Karakoram\"&gt;Karakoram&lt;/a&gt; was climbed in 1976, Namcha Barwa became the &lt;a href=\"Highest%20unclimbed%20mountain\"&gt;highest unclimbed independent mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the world,\nuntil it was finally climbed in 1992.\nIn addition to being one of the highest mountains in the world, Namcha Barwa is also the third most &lt;a href=\"Topographic%20prominence\"&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt; peak in the Himalayas after &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Everest\"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nanga%20Parbat\"&gt;Nanga Parbat&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingdon-Ward\"&gt;Frank Kingdon-Ward&lt;/a&gt; described in the 1920s \"a quaint prophecy among the \n&lt;a href=\"Kongpo\"&gt;Kongbo&lt;/a&gt; Tibetans that Namche Barwa will one day fall into the Tsangpo gorge and block the river, which will then turn aside and flow over the Doshong La [pass]. This is recorded in a book by some fabulous person whose image may be seen in the little &lt;a href=\"gompa\"&gt;gompa&lt;/a&gt; [Buddhist monastery] at Payi, in &lt;a href=\"Bom%C3%AA%20County\"&gt;Pome&lt;/a&gt;.\"(126-7) (See &lt;a href=\"Beyul\"&gt;Beyul&lt;/a&gt; for the reason behind the prophecy and &lt;a href=\"Padmasambhava\"&gt;Padmasambhava&lt;/a&gt; or some other &lt;a href=\"Tert%C3%B6n\"&gt;Tert\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; for the \"fabulous person whose image may be seen in the little gompa\").\nClimbing history.\nNamcha Barwa was located in 1912 by British surveyors but the area remained virtually unvisited until Chinese alpinists began attempting the peak in the 1980s. Although they scouted multiple routes, they did not reach the summit. In 1990 a Chinese-Japanese expedition reconnoitered the peak. Another joint expedition reached in 1991 but lost member Hiroshi Onishi in an avalanche. The next year a third Chinese-Japanese expedition established six camps on the South Ridge over intermediate Nai Peng () reaching the summit October 30.\nEleven climbers reached the summit.\nU.K. Alpine Club's Himalayan Index lists no further ascents."
