    "text": "Phoenix F.C. is a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Fingal\"&gt;Fingal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The club competes in the Athletic Union League (association football). Phoenix plays at a football complex in Scribblestown. Their former manager Robbie Gorman who started his coaching career at The Nix in 2015 won two league titles, a league cup and led the team to three consecutive promotions before handing over the reigns to Marc Hughes. \nNotable players include ex Bohemian F.C. player Marc Hughes, ex Shamrock Rovers legend Marc Kenny, and Ciar\u00e1n O'Donoghue.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed on 1 June 2006 by the amalgamation of Ashtown Villa and Kinvara Ards. For their part, Kinvara Ards, who were established in 1982, had previously merged with Kinvara Boys.\nThe committee of Ashtown Villa FC had a vision to bring in schoolboy football to the community based on one club operating in Scribblestown at the wonderful &amp; pristine all weather facilities which is complemented with two grass pitches and a modern club house.\nThis facility in Scribblestown would not have been possible without the hard work &amp; graft of Seamus O' Connell and his committee. Seamus picked up on an opportunity for a ground swap deal with a well known property developer which left the club in a very healthy financial state."
