    "title": "Colour fastness",
    "text": "Colour fastness is a term\u2014used in the &lt;a href=\"dyeing\"&gt;dyeing&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; materials\u2014that characterizes a material's &lt;a href=\"colour\"&gt;colour&lt;/a&gt;'s resistance to &lt;a href=\"Color%20fade\"&gt;fading&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20dyeing%20terms%23R\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;. Colour fastness is the property of dyes and it is directly proportional to the binding force between photochromic dye and the fiber. The colour fastness may also be affected by &lt;a href=\"Wet%20processing%20engineering\"&gt;processing techniques&lt;/a&gt; and choice of chemicals and axillaries.\nThe term is usually used in the context of &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt;. In general, clothing should be tested for colour fastness before using &lt;a href=\"bleach\"&gt;bleach&lt;/a&gt; or other cleaning products.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightfastness\"&gt;Light fastness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washing\"&gt;wash&lt;/a&gt; fastness, and &lt;a href=\"Abrasion%20%28mechanical%29\"&gt;rub&lt;/a&gt; fastness are the main forms of colour fastness that are standardized. The &lt;a href=\"Lightfastness\"&gt;light fastness&lt;/a&gt; of textile dye is categorized from one to eight and the wash fastness from one to five, with a higher the number indicating better fastness.\nDye and the binding forces.\nA &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Acolored\"&gt;colored&lt;/a&gt; substance that chemically bonds to the &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Asubstrate\"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt; to which it is being applied. Dyes are classified according to their solubility and chemical properties. Dyes are selected according to the affinity, any given dye does not apply to every type of &lt;a href=\"fiber\"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. The different binding forces acts between the dye and substrate. Such as &lt;a href=\"Van%20der%20Waals%20force\"&gt;Van der Waals force&lt;/a&gt;s include attraction and repulsions between atoms, molecules, and surfaces, as well as other intermolecular forces. Example is &lt;a href=\"Direct%20dye\"&gt;Direct dye&lt;/a&gt;s application to &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; that results poor fastness properties to washing. The bond differs from &lt;a href=\"Covalent%20bond\"&gt;covalent&lt;/a&gt; bonding in &lt;a href=\"reactive%20dye\"&gt;reactive dye&lt;/a&gt;s when applied to cotton that may result far better fastness than direct dyes. Covalent bond is a stronger bond, caused by correlations in the fluctuating polarizations of nearby particles (a consequence of &lt;a href=\"quantum%20dynamics\"&gt;quantum dynamics&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Pigment\"&gt;Pigment&lt;/a&gt;s as an exception do not bind chemically with textile materials.\nImportance of colour fastness.\nColour is an influential element of fashion and aesthetics of clothing, it has great value for both the user and the brand. Colour is one of the most significant features in attracting customers and inclines to buy a product/garment. Retaining the original colour is one of the important quality parameter of coloured textiles. Colour fastness is rated poor if it does not comply with the tests by exposing to &lt;a href=\"laundry\"&gt;laundry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightfastness\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, rubbing and other agencies such as &lt;a href=\"perspiration\"&gt;perspiration&lt;/a&gt;.\nTest methods for colour fastness.\nFading, change in colour, staining to adjacent textiles material were common complaint of poor textile quality materials. Standardized testing for colourfastness and other parameters were established in 20th century by leading industrialized countries such as US,UK, Europe and Japan. &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20Textile%20Chemists%20and%20Colorists\"&gt;AATCC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization\"&gt;International Organization for Standardization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Dyers%20and%20Colourists\"&gt;Society of Dyers and Colourists&lt;/a&gt; played vital role in establishing the test methods.\nThere are various tests and testing methods according to the physical and functional requirements from the product. For example fastness to saliva may be important for kids-wear and perspiration and light is important for a &lt;a href=\"Golf%20shirt\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; shirt. European and US retailers use &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization\"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AATCC\"&gt;AATCC&lt;/a&gt; standards respectively."
