He later became a player and coach in Australia.\nHe began his playing career at &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt; in 1971, making 75 league appearances in a four-year spell at the club. He spent 1975 to 1980 at &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt;, making over 100 appearances for the club. He won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt; title with the \"Imps\" in 1975\u201376. Loaned out to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, he emigrated to Australia and signed with &lt;a href=\"Wollongong%20Wolves%20FC\"&gt;Wollongong City&lt;/a&gt;. He retired as a player in 1986, and later coached Wollongong Olympic, Kemblawarra (in two spells), Port Kembla, and &lt;a href=\"Wollongong%20United%20FC\"&gt;Wollongong United&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nFleming began his career at &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt;, who finished 15th in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Football%20League\"&gt;1971\u201372&lt;/a&gt; under the stewardship of &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20Summers\"&gt;Gerry Summers&lt;/a&gt;. They rose up to eighth in &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League\"&gt;1972\u201373&lt;/a&gt;, before finishing just two points and two places above the relegation zone in &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League\"&gt;1973\u201374&lt;/a&gt;. The \"U's\" finished 11th in &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt;. Fleming scored two goals in 75 league games during his spell at the &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Ground%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Manor Ground&lt;/a&gt;. He then transferred to &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Taylor\"&gt;Graham Taylor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt;, who won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt; title in &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League\"&gt;1975\u201376&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Imps\" then consolidated their &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; status with a ninth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League\"&gt;1976\u201377&lt;/a&gt;. They then dropped down to 16th place in &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League\"&gt;1977\u201378&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"George%20Kerr%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;George Kerr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Bell\"&gt;Willie Bell&lt;/a&gt;'s stewardship. However they struggled under new boss &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201950%29\"&gt;Colin Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, and Fleming scored six goals in the &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League\"&gt;1978\u201379&lt;/a&gt; relegation season, enough to make him the club's joint &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Lincoln%20City%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;top-scorer&lt;/a&gt; (along with &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Cockerill\"&gt;Glenn Cockerill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Harford\"&gt;Mick Harford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Hobson\"&gt;Gordon Hobson&lt;/a&gt;). He was sent on loan to &lt;a href=\"John%20McGrath%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201938%29\"&gt;John McGrath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in March 1980. His debut game for the \"Valiants\" came against parent club Lincoln on 15 March; the Vale lost 3\u20130. He played just a further two games, having failed to impress at &lt;a href=\"Vale%20Park\"&gt;Vale Park&lt;/a&gt;. He left &lt;a href=\"Sincil%20Bank\"&gt;Sincil Bank&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League\"&gt;1979\u201380&lt;/a&gt; season, having scored 18 goals in 141 league and cup games at the club. Fleming joined &lt;a href=\"Wollongong%20Wolves%20FC\"&gt;Wollongong City&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian &lt;a href=\"National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;National Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; where he spent the next six years, amassing over a hundred appearances. City finished 11th in &lt;a href=\"1981%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;, third in &lt;a href=\"1982%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;, 15th in &lt;a href=\"1983%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, 12th (of 12) in the Northern Conference in &lt;a href=\"1984%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, tenth in &lt;a href=\"1985%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, and eighth in &lt;a href=\"1986%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nIn July 1998, he was sacked as coach of Wollongong Olympic despite the club standing in equal fifth place of the league and also being and a semi-finalist in the Bampton Cup.\nA week after departing Olympic, Fleming was appointed coach of Kemblawarra taking over from Joe Coelho, who had been acting as player-coach since the sacking of Jim Dafkovski. He departed the club at the end of the 2003 season.\nAfter a year away, Fleming returned to Kemblawarra as coach for the 2005 season, replacing player-coach Richard Lloyd who would miss the season due to work commitments in Canada. However, his second spell at the helm would be short-lived as, at the end of August 2005, he resigned from the club after a dispute over the club's handling of a training ground disciplinary incident involving a youth grade player.\nIn April 2006, he succeeded the sacked Harry Sattin as coach of Port Kembla. He was sacked in May 2009.\nIn November 2009, he became coach of &lt;a href=\"Wollongong%20United%20FC\"&gt;Wollongong United&lt;/a&gt;. He \"walked out on the club\" in May 2012 after falling out with president Peter Vrtkovski.\nStatistics.\nSource:"
