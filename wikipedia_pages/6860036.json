    "text": "Michael Gaughan (5 October 1949 \u2013 3 June 1974) was a &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; (IRA) &lt;a href=\"hunger%20strike\"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;r who died in 1974 in &lt;a href=\"Parkhurst%20%28HM%20Prison%29\"&gt;Parkhurst Prison&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt;, England.\nBackground.\nGaughan, the eldest of six children, was born in &lt;a href=\"Ballina%2C%20County%20Mayo\"&gt;Ballina, County Mayo&lt;/a&gt;, in 1949. Gaughan grew up at Healy Terrace and was educated at &lt;a href=\"St%20Muredach%27s%20College\"&gt;St Muredach's College&lt;/a&gt;, Ballina, and after finishing his schooling, he emigrated from Ireland to England in search of work.\nWhilst in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, Gaughan became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Irish%20Republican%20Army\"&gt;Official Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; (OIRA) through &lt;a href=\"Official%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Official Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt;'s English wing \"&lt;a href=\"Clann%20na%20h%C3%89ireann\"&gt;Clann na h\u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt;\" and became an IRA &lt;a href=\"volunteer%20%28Irish%20republican%29\"&gt;volunteer&lt;/a&gt; in a London-based &lt;a href=\"Active%20Service%20Unit\"&gt;Active Service Unit&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1971, he was sentenced at the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bailey\"&gt;Old Bailey&lt;/a&gt; to seven years imprisonment for his part in an IRA fundraising mission to rob a bank in &lt;a href=\"Hornsey\"&gt;Hornsey&lt;/a&gt;, north London, which yielded just \u00a3530, and for the possession of two revolvers.\nGaughan was initially imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Wormwood%20Scrubs\"&gt;Wormwood Scrubs&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent two years before being transferred to the top security &lt;a href=\"Albany%20%28HM%20Prison%29\"&gt;Albany Prison&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst at Albany Prison, Gaughan requested political status; this was refused, and he was then put in solitary confinement. He was later transferred to &lt;a href=\"Parkhurst%20Prison\"&gt;Parkhurst Prison&lt;/a&gt;, where four of the &lt;a href=\"Belfast%20Ten\"&gt;Belfast Ten&lt;/a&gt; were on hunger strike for political status.\nOn 31 March 1974, Gaughan, along with current Sinn F\u00e9in MLA &lt;a href=\"Gerry%20Kelly\"&gt;Gerry Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Holme, &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Feeney\"&gt;Hugh Feeney&lt;/a&gt; and fellow Mayoman &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Stagg%20%28Irish%20republican%29\"&gt;Frank Stagg&lt;/a&gt;, went on hunger strike to support the fight of &lt;a href=\"Dolours%20Price\"&gt;Dolours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Price\"&gt;Marian Price&lt;/a&gt; to obtain political status and to be transferred to a jail in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoners' demands were as follows.\nOn April 10, 1974 Gaughan and Stagg were both transferred to the prison hospital for observation, force feeding began two weeks later.\nForce-feeding.\nBritish policy at this time was to &lt;a href=\"Force-feeding\"&gt;force feed&lt;/a&gt; hunger strikers. According to the National Hunger Strike Commemoration Committee, \"six to eight guards would restrain the prisoner and drag him or her by the hair to the top of the bed, where they would stretch the prisoner's neck over the metal rail, force a block between his or her teeth and then pass a feeding tube, which extended down the throat, through a hole in the block.\"\nAfter visiting Michael in jail, his brother John described his condition: \"His throat had been badly cut by force feeding and his teeth loosened. His eyes were sunken, his cheeks hollow and his mouth was gaping open. He weighed about six stone.\"\nDuring his hunger strike, his weight dropped from 160\u00a0lb to 84\u00a0lb Gaughan was force-fed from 22 April and this occurred 17 times during course of his hunger strike. The last time he was force-fed was the night before his death on Sunday 2 June. After a hunger strike that lasted 64 days, he died on Monday 3 June 1974, aged 24 years old. Gaughan was one of 22 Irish republicans to die on hunger strike in the 20th century, the largest hunger stike was the &lt;a href=\"1923%20Irish%20Hunger%20Strikes\"&gt;1923 Irish Hunger Strikes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cause of his death was disputed. The British government stated that he died of pneumonia; the Gaughan family stated that he died after prison doctors injured him fatally when food lodged in a lung punctured by a force-feeding tube.\nGaughan's death caused controversy in English medical circles, as some forms of treatment can be classed as assault if given without the express permission of the patient.\nThe timing of his death came just one week after the British Government had capitulated to the demands of the loyalist &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Workers%27%20Council%20strike\"&gt;Ulster Workers' Council strike&lt;/a&gt;. After Gaughan's death, the British government's policy of force-feeding ended, and the remaining hunger strikers were given assurances that they would be repatriated to Irish prisons. However, these promises were reneged on by the British government.\nFinal message.\nMichael Gaughan left a final message:\nHis death is referenced in the song \"Take me Home to Mayo\", also known as \"The Ballad of Michael Gaughan\", composed by Seamus Robinson and performed and recorded by many Irish musicians including &lt;a href=\"Christy%20Moore\"&gt;Christy Moore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wolfe%20Tones\"&gt;Wolfe Tones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Warfield\"&gt;Derek Warfield&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20Ramblers\"&gt;Dublin City Ramblers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuneral.\nGaughan's body was initially removed from London and on Friday, 7 June, and on Saturday, 8 June 1974, over 3,000 mourners lined the streets of &lt;a href=\"Kilburn%2C%20London\"&gt;Kilburn&lt;/a&gt; and marched behind his coffin, which was flanked by an IRA honour guard, to a &lt;a href=\"Requiem\"&gt;Requiem Mass&lt;/a&gt; held in the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart%20Church%2C%20Kilburn\"&gt;Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Saturday, his body was transported to &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, where again it was met by mourners and another IRA &lt;a href=\"guard%20of%20honour\"&gt;guard of honour&lt;/a&gt; who brought it to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Adam and Eve's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; church on &lt;a href=\"River%20Liffey%23Quays\"&gt;Merchant's Quay&lt;/a&gt;, where thousands filed past as it &lt;a href=\"Lying%20in%20state\"&gt;lay in state&lt;/a&gt;. The following day, his body was removed to Ballina, County Mayo. The funeral mass took place on 9 June, at St. Muredach's Cathedral, and the procession then led to Leigue Cemetery. Gaughan was given a full IRA funeral and was laid to rest in the &lt;a href=\"republican%20plot\"&gt;republican plot&lt;/a&gt;, where Frank Stagg would join him after being reburied in November 1976. His funeral was attended by over 50,000 people and was larger than the funeral of former president &lt;a href=\"%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera\"&gt;\u00c9amon de Valera&lt;/a&gt; the following year.\nBallina &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; Jackie Clarke presided at the last &lt;a href=\"obsequies\"&gt;obsequies&lt;/a&gt;, and the oration at his graveside was given by &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1ith%C3%AD%20%C3%93%20Conaill\"&gt;D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill&lt;/a&gt;, who stated that Gaughan had \"been tortured in prison by the vampires of a discredited empire who were joined by decrepit politicians who were a disgrace to the name of Irishmen\".\nHis coffin was draped in the same &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Tricolour&lt;/a&gt; that was used for &lt;a href=\"Terence%20McSwiney\"&gt;Terence McSwiney&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral 54 years earlier. It would later be used for the funeral of James McDade, an IRA member killed in a premature explosion in Coventry.\nThe funeral embarrassed the anti-republican &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Gael\"&gt;Fine Gael&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%2020th%20D%C3%A1il\"&gt;coalition government&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin at the time and its &lt;a href=\"Taoiseach\"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Cosgrave\"&gt;Liam Cosgrave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paddy%20Cooney\"&gt;Paddy Cooney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Justice%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Minister for Justice&lt;/a&gt; at the time, claimed that the IRA intimidated businesses in the towns that the funeral procession passed through, forcing them to close.\nCommemoration.\nThere are annual lectures and commemorations in honour of Gaughan, Frank Stagg and &lt;a href=\"Sean%20McNeela\"&gt;Sean McNeela&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Ballycroy%2C%20County%20Mayo\"&gt;Ballycroy&lt;/a&gt; IRA man who died on hunger strike in Dublin in 1940) at the republican plot in Ballina by both &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Republican Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a march from the &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Joseph%20Amable%20Humbert\"&gt;Humbert monument&lt;/a&gt; in Ballina to Leigue Cemetery. The Republican Sinn F\u00e9in &lt;a href=\"cumann\"&gt;cumann&lt;/a&gt; in Mayo is named the \"McNeela-Gaughan-Stagg Cumann\".\nOn 12 February 2006, a &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Irish%20murals\"&gt;mural&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to Stagg and Gaughan, was unveiled on the &lt;a href=\"Falls%20Road%20%28Belfast%29\"&gt;Falls Road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;."
