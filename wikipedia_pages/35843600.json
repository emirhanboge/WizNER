When I moved back to Saudi Arabia, I learned from many people that it is much easier to fly &lt;a href=\"fixed%20wing\"&gt;fixed wing&lt;/a&gt; here than helicopters, so I went to study fixed wing flying and got my licence. I now hold the US &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Agency\"&gt;Federal Aviation Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) licence. Since I started flying in Saudi Arabia, I met many pilots and other people who would love to fly here, so I decided to start a &lt;a href=\"flying%20school\"&gt;flying school&lt;/a&gt; about two years ago.\"\nPrince Turki is \"a licensed helicopter and fixed wing pilot,\" and a board member of the &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Aviation%20Club\"&gt;Saudi Aviation Club&lt;/a&gt;.
