    "text": "The Premiership Rugby Cup is an English &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; knockout cup competition for teams in &lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;Premiership Rugby&lt;/a&gt;. It was created in 2018 to replace the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Welsh%20Cup\"&gt;Anglo-Welsh Cup&lt;/a&gt; after the withdrawal of the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20of%20regional%20rugby%20union%20teams%20in%20Wales\"&gt;Welsh regions&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Premiership Rugby Cup was created to replace the Anglo-Welsh Cup which had been running since 2005 when the Welsh regions joined the then English-only Powergen Cup. In the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Anglo-Welsh%20Cup\"&gt;2017\u201318 Anglo-Welsh Cup&lt;/a&gt;, all four of the Welsh regions finished bottom of their pools. In May 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Welsh Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; announced that they were going to be setting up a Welsh under-23s competition for their regions and would thus be unable to commit to Anglo-Welsh Cup games. Premiership Rugby Limited, which organises the English top flight, then announced that the Anglo-Welsh Cup would be replaced by the Premiership Rugby Cup, which would be solely for the English Premiership clubs. The Cup was created to continue to allow younger English Premiership players to compete in more matches at Premiership stadia.\nThe 2020\u201321 tournament was cancelled due to the effects of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormat.\nThe format for the competition until 2019\u201320 consisted of the twelve Premiership teams grouped into three pools of four with at least one club having one local derby match in their groups. The matches were typically held over either the &lt;a href=\"end-of-year%20rugby%20union%20internationals\"&gt;Autumn International&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; weekends. The three pool winners and the best runner-up will enter the semi-finals with home advantage given to the team with the better record in the pool stage and the final would be held at the home of the highest ranked club. The winning club will receive \u00a3500,000."
