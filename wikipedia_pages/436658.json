    "text": "Ulama () is a ball game played in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, currently experiencing a revival from its home in a few communities in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20states\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sinaloa\"&gt;Sinaloa&lt;/a&gt;. As a descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Aztec\"&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt; version of the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20ballgame\"&gt;Mesoamerican ballgame&lt;/a&gt;, the game is regarded as one of the oldest continuously played sports in the world and as the oldest known game using a rubber &lt;a href=\"ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe word \"ulama\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; word \"\u014dllamaliztli\" a combination of \"\u014dllamas\" (playing of a game with a ball) and \"\u014dllei\" (rubber). \"\u014cllamaliztli\" was the Aztec name for the Mesoamerican ballgame, whose roots extended back to at least the 2nd millennium &lt;a href=\"Before%20Christ\"&gt;BC&lt;/a&gt; and evidence of which has been found in nearly all &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt;n cultures in an area extending from modern-day &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador\"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Archaeologists have uncovered rubber balls dating to at least 1600 BC, ballgamer figures from at least 1200 BC, and nearly 1500 ancient ball courts.\nDue to its religious and ritual aspects, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; suppressed the game soon after the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish conquest&lt;/a&gt;. It survived in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Sinaloa\"&gt;Sinaloa&lt;/a&gt;, where Spanish influence was less pervasive.\nAs part of its nationwide revival, the game now has a home in the capital &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, at a cultural centre in the &lt;a href=\"Azcapotzalco\"&gt;Azcapotzalco&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood.\nUlama.\nUlama games are played on a temporary court called a \"tastei\" (, from \"tlachtli\" , the Nahuatl word meaning \"ballcourt\"). The bounds of these long narrow courts are made by drawing or &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;ing thick lines in the dirt. The courts are divided into opposing sides by a center line, called an \"analco\". A ball that is allowed to cross the end line, the \"chichi\" or \"chivo\", will result in a point scored for the opposing team. Points or \"rayas\" (\"lines\", so named for the &lt;a href=\"tally%20marks\"&gt;tally marks&lt;/a&gt; used to keep score) are gained in play. The scoring system provides for resetting the score to zero under certain conditions, which can make for lengthy games.\nThe modern-day game has three main forms:\nThe object of the game is to keep the ball in play and in-bounds. Depending on the score and the local variant of the rules, the ball is played either high or low. A team scores a point when a player of the opposing team hits the ball out of turn, misses the ball, knocks the ball out of bounds, touches the ball with any part of the body aside from the hip, accidentally touches a teammate, lets the ball stop moving before it reaches the center line, or even if they fail to announce the score after they have scored a point.\nThe first team that scores eight points wins. If both teams end up having the same number of points after a turn, both sides begin again from zero. One record-setting game reportedly lasted for eight days. Most modern games are stopped after about two hours.\nUlama balls.\n\"See also &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20rubber%20balls\"&gt;Mesoamerican rubber balls&lt;/a&gt;\""
