    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, a municipal council (&lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;: \"conseil municipal\") is an elected body of the &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; responsible for \"executing, in its deliberations, the business of the town\" (translated).\nThe council must meet at least once a &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20year%23Quarters\"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt;, or at a request from at least one third of its members, but usually meets once a month. The council manages the smallest French territorial community with legal and financial autonomy, the commune.\nParticipation in the Municipal council vote as a candidate or as an elector is a privilege given only to &lt;a href=\"Citizenship%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;European citizens&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Brexit\"&gt;British choice and decision to leave the European Union on 1 February 2020&lt;/a&gt; had the consequence that 800 elected \"conseillers municipaux\" of British nationality were no longer eligible to be re-elected on 15 March 2020.\nComposition.\nThe number of seats in the municipal council depends on the number of inhabitants. This number is set by law: 7 seats for municipalities with less than 100 inhabitants to 69 seats for those with more than 300,000 inhabitants.\nThe number of councilors depends on the size of the city. The decree of 27 January 1977 gives that number based on segments of the population of the municipality of 9 members for smaller municipalities up to 49 more cities 300,000 inhabitants.\nThe law of November 1982, which is part of a package of reforms being made by the (PLM Act) on the specific case of the three biggest cities of France, changed the composition of municipal councils, maintaining the same segments of the population, from 9 to 49 members.\nFinally, the Act of 17 May 2013 has been lowered from 9 to 7 the number of councilors in smaller communities with less than 100 inhabitants:\nFor Paris, &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marseilles\"&gt;Marseilles&lt;/a&gt;, the number of councilors which should not be confused with the \"borough or sector' councilors\" which are more numerous but have limited powers, is determined by the :\nCouncilors are elected by direct &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt; for a term of six years, and can be reelected. The vote takes place following the .\nElection.\nThe electoral system differs depending on the size of the municipality. The term of elected officials is 6 years. There are no term limits for city councilors.\nIn 2013, the law distinguished between the municipalities of less than 3500 inhabitants and those larger, the first electing their municipal councilors using a &lt;a href=\"two-round%20system\"&gt;two-round system&lt;/a&gt;, the second using &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; in two rounds. In municipalities with less than 3500 inhabitants, municipal councilors are elected by majority vote in two rounds, and in the municipalities of less than 2500 inhabitants, the candidate does not have to be registered to be elected.\nBeginning with the &lt;a href=\"2014%20French%20municipal%20elections\"&gt;elections of 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the threshold of 3500 inhabitants was reduced to 1000 inhabitants to facilitate the between men and women in elected office: Now, &lt;a href=\"plurality-at-large%20voting\"&gt;plurality-at-large voting&lt;/a&gt; is only used in communes with a population less than 1000 inhabitants. For communes with more than 1000 inhabitants, &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; is used. In addition, candidates who registered their candidacy with the prefecture or sub-prefecture can be elected, whatever the size of the municipality.\nCommunes under 1000 inhabitants.\nThe election of municipal councilors uses a &lt;a href=\"plurality-at-large%20voting\"&gt;plurality-at-large voting&lt;/a&gt; in two rounds, with &lt;a href=\"panachage\"&gt;panachage&lt;/a&gt;:\nA candidate must registry with the prefecture or sub-prefecture to be elected. Candidates not on a list and incomplete lists are allowed, but can not be elected if they have not previously applied for candidacy. The votes are recorded individually, and &lt;a href=\"panachage\"&gt;panachage&lt;/a&gt; is allowed: Voters have the right to change the ballot by selecting candidates from various lists.\nCommunes with 1000 or more inhabitants.\nThe council members are elected using &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; with two rounds, with the winning list getting additional seats. The winning list (absolute majority in the first round, relative majority in the second) wins half the seats. The other half is distributed proportionally among all the lists with a minimum of 5% of the vote (the first or second round, as appropriate).\nThe lists are blocked. Voters may not select individual candidates from lists, but must vote for an entire list. Each list must contain as many names as there are seats to be filled.\nA municipal council may be composed of representatives from one list:\nSpecial Cases of Paris, Lyon and Marseilles.\nThe three largest cities in France \u2013 Paris, &lt;a href=\"Marseilles\"&gt;Marseilles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 are divided into electoral areas, corresponding to an &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20arrondissements%20of%20France\"&gt;arrondissement&lt;/a&gt; in Paris and Lyon, or formed by combining two arrondissements in the same area for Marseilles.\nEach of these sectors elect, following the voting procedure of cities with more than 1,000 residents, municipal councilors Seats for arrondissements councilors are then distributed according to the same rules between list members not appointed to council. All the councilors elected in each electoral area form the council of the arrondissement. The town of Paris is, since 1964, a unique case, being at the same time both a commune and a department, it is represented by only one deliberative assembly, called the &lt;a href=\"council%20of%20Paris\"&gt;council of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, which has both the role of a municipal council and a . The &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Mayor of Paris&lt;/a&gt; also serves as Chairman of the General Council of the department of Paris.\nPowers.\nThe municipal council is chaired by the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt;, and collectively has the legislative authority on the territory of the commune.\nThe mayor, primarily responsible for preparing and implementing the decisions of the council, is elected by the council, using a &lt;a href=\"two-round%20system\"&gt;two-round system&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 2008 municipal elections, the election of deputy mayors in municipalities with more than 3,500 inhabitants is carried out using \"party list by absolute majority, without splitting or preferential voting.\" On each of the lists of candidates for these positions, \"the gap between the number of candidates of each gender can not be more than one\", to ensure balanced representation of both sexes.\nThe municipal council has authority to regulate the affairs of the community through its deliberations. The council is empowered to make all decisions regarding communal management, except where the law specifically supports the mayor or other administrative authority.\nThe council makes decisions on the use of property in the municipality.\nThe council votes on the municipal budget, prepared by the mayor and his deputies, and rates, creates and removes the jobs of municipal officials, allows acquisitions and disposals of the commune, approves loans and grants for the town, fixed tariffs for communal services and parking on the street.\nThe council adopts the , establishes primary and nursery schools.\nThe town owns (schools, municipal roads, gardens, etc.) and, if applicable, a private area. The public domain is protected by rules of inalienability and the law provides for sanctions to protect this property.\nOperation.\nThe council meets at least once per quarter. In practice, it generally meets once a month.\nThe city council adopts its rules of procedure within the rule of law. The &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28France%29\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; will call the council to order whenever he considers it necessary and also to build the democratic legitimacy of this assembly elected by direct universal suffrage.\nCity council members are convened by relatively restrictive rules, indeed, the general code of local government imposes a minimum time to call for a meeting well in advance, so the council can prepare for the meeting. In light of this city council members may, if they think that they information, request submission of additional documents. This practice is often cause for cancellation of the city council.\nQuorum rules are respected: there must be a minimum number of representatives to be present in order for a decision to be valid. In case the quorum is not obtained, the mayor must postpone deliberation and convene a new council for which no quorum shall be required in order to not block the functioning of the institution.\nAny citizen can challenge and argue with the council. In the event of serious malfunction, the council may request a dissolution decree from the Council of Ministers.\nThe Mayor.\nThe municipal council of each &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; elects the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; of the town. The mayor presides over the council, which organizes the work and performs the deliberations.\nThe Mayor also has significant powers and their own responsibilities, such as the responsibility for the activities of the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Police%20%28France%29\"&gt;municipal police&lt;/a&gt;, or the responsibility for the management of municipal council staff.\nCity council for children (CME), youth (CMJ) and seniors (CMS).\nThere are certain &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; with child councils and/or youth councils with multiple names (municipal youth councils, local youth councils, youth forum etc.).\nThe first municipal youth councils in France were created between 1963 and 1967 (including Sedan and a score of other medium-sized cities). These experiments have not experienced the same durability or the same media that children's councils &lt;a href=\"Schiltigheim\"&gt;Schiltigheim&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bas-Rhin\"&gt;Bas-Rhin&lt;/a&gt;) in 1979, often presented as the first French political experience. Other councils have been created in 1980, but especially since 1990 and early 2000s.\nThese informal bodies are created by municipal councils. Their mode of operation varies by commune, the age (9 to 25) and the input mode (election town hall, schools, designation within representative associations, &lt;a href=\"volunteering\"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt;, etc. mixed system).\nThese spaces are advisory (its deliberations carry no regulatory power if they are not approved by resolution of the elected council or &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28France%29\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;), but also allows young people to act for their country and take action . Formally, they are often chaired or served by a municipal councilor.\nEach community that wishes to have a children's or youth council freely determines the operating rules of and operates according to the fundamental principles of the Republic, such as principle of non-discrimination. Usually they meet in committee or group projects 1\u20132 times per month and plenary 2\u20133 times a year. The average tenure is about 2 years.\nAccording to the (National associate of children's and youth councils) which includes municipalities that have created one of these groups, there are currently 2000 groups nationally.\nSome municipalities have established senior councils, operating according to rules similar to youth councils: for example, &lt;a href=\"Antony%2C%20Hauts-de-Seine\"&gt;Antony, Hauts-de-Seine&lt;/a&gt;."
