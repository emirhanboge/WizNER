The park also has free to use tennis and basket ball courts.\nWest Harrow Park is also the home of the West Harrow Bowling Club founded in 1928. The club is affiliated to Bowls England, Middlesex County Bowling Association and Harrow and District Bowling Association and enters teams, sometimes mixed, in midweek and evening leagues.\nThe West Harrow Allotment and Garden Association (WHAGA) started in 1955. The Association aims to provide a voice for the plot holders on the two West Harrow allotment sites (as of January 2022 there are vacant plots available). The Association arranges trips to Wisley, the Royal Horticutural site, and other places.

The overall crime rate in Harrow in 2020 was 60 crimes per 1,000 people. This compares favourably to London's overall crime rate, coming in 45% lower than the London rate of 87 per 1,000 residents. For England, Wales, and Northern Ireland as a whole, Harrow is among the top 10 safest cities, and the 2,057th most dangerous location out of all towns, cities, and villages.\nZoning information.\nWest Harrow is almost exclusively residential, with a few threads of localized commercial zoning around its edges and a small number of corner shops.\nHistory.\nPrior to the early 20th century, West Harrow was overwhelmingly rural. The construction of the Uxbridge extension to the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20line\"&gt;Metropolitan line&lt;/a&gt; in 1904, and specifically the new &lt;a href=\"West%20Harrow%20tube%20station\"&gt;West Harrow tube station&lt;/a&gt;, triggered a steady growth of housing developments in the area, spreading out from the location of the new station. In his 1973 BBC television film about London &lt;a href=\"suburbia\"&gt;suburbia&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Metro-Land%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Metroland&lt;/a&gt;\", Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Betjeman\"&gt;John Betjeman&lt;/a&gt; stands in Vaughan Road and delivers a piece to camera about the development of the area in the 1900s. In the remaining clear areas of West Harrow, small council and retirement estates were built in the second half of the 20th century.\nSeveral of the roads in West Harrow are named after teachers at &lt;a href=\"Harrow%20School\"&gt;Harrow School&lt;/a&gt;, as described by Betjeman in his film: Drury Road (&lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Drury\"&gt;Joseph Drury&lt;/a&gt;); Vaughan Road (&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Vaughan%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Charles Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;); Butler Road (&lt;a href=\"Henry%20Montagu%20Butler\"&gt;Henry Montagu Butler&lt;/a&gt;); Bowen Road (&lt;a href=\"Edward%20Ernest%20Bowen\"&gt;Edward Ernest Bowen&lt;/a&gt;); Sumner Road (&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Carey%20Sumner\"&gt;Robert Carey Sumner&lt;/a&gt;); and Heath Road (Benjamin Heath). Merivale Road (Charles Merivale, one of the pair who started the Boat Race). All the roads on the Honeybun Estate (one of the borough's first Council estates are also named after Harrow schoolmasters."
