    "text": "The Archipelago of the Recherche, known locally as the Bay of Isles, is a group of 105 islands, and over 1200 \"obstacles to shipping\", off the &lt;a href=\"south%20coast%20of%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;south coast of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The islands stretch from east to west and to off-shore encompassing an area of approximately .\nThe western group is near &lt;a href=\"Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Esperance&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern group at &lt;a href=\"Israelite%20Bay%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Israelite Bay&lt;/a&gt;. They are located in coastal waters, part of which is designated the &lt;a href=\"Recherche%20Archipelago%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Recherche Archipelago Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPre-European.\nEvidence of human occupation around 13,000 years ago occurs on the islands. \n&lt;a href=\"Archeologist\"&gt;Archeologist&lt;/a&gt;s have found ancient artefacts on &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20Island%20%28Recherche%20Archipelago%29\"&gt;Salisbury Island&lt;/a&gt;, a massive limestone remnant sitting on a granite dome offshore, that included stone blades, lizard traps, axe heads, grinding stones and granite watering holes. The objects are believed to extend up to 13,000 years before present, from a time of lower sea levels when many of the islands were joined to the mainland.\nEuropean discovery and naming.\nThe islands became known to Europeans when &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Thijssen\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Thijssen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pieter%20Nuyts\"&gt;Pieter Nuyts&lt;/a&gt;, sailing on \"Gulden Zeepaert\", charted the coast in 1627. &lt;a href=\"George%20Vancouver\"&gt;George Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; also passed through the archipelago as part of his expedition in &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Discovery%20%281789%29\"&gt;HMS \"Discovery\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1791.\nThe area was named Archipelago of the Recherche (, ) by Rear-admiral &lt;a href=\"Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux\"&gt;Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux&lt;/a&gt; in 1792 during a French expedition in search of the vanished navigator &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Galaup%2C%20comte%20de%20Lap%C3%A9rouse\"&gt;Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse&lt;/a&gt;. The name was taken from one of the admiral's ships, \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Recherche%20%281787%29\"&gt;Recherche&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Research\"). The bay containing the current town of Esperance was named for his other ship, \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Esp%C3%A9rance%20%281781%29\"&gt;Esp\u00e9rance&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Flinders\"&gt;Matthew Flinders&lt;/a&gt; was the first to explore and chart the islands of the archipelago in 1802 as part of his voyage in the &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29\"&gt;\"Investigator\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaritime history.\nFlinders abandoned two anchors when leaving &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Island%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Middle Island&lt;/a&gt; in 1803. These were found and recovered in 1973 by divers. The &lt;a href=\"Anchor%23Anchoring%20gear\"&gt;bower anchor&lt;/a&gt; is on display at the &lt;a href=\"South%20Australian%20Maritime%20Museum\"&gt;South Australian Maritime Museum&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"stream%20anchor\"&gt;stream anchor&lt;/a&gt; can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Museum of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSealers and whalers from other British colonies on the Australian continent frequented the area since at least the early 1820s. Australia's only recorded pirate, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Jack%20Anderson\"&gt;Black Jack Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, frequented the archipelago in the 1830s. A former whaler, he turned to piracy and wreaked havoc in the area until being murdered by his crew.\nMiddle Island was regarded as the &lt;a href=\"right%20whale\"&gt;right whale&lt;/a&gt; hunting station of the bight in the 1830s and 1840s.\nThe archipelago is recorded as the site of &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s and other maritime incidents. The &lt;a href=\"brig\"&gt;brig&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Belinda%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Belinda&lt;/a&gt;\" was wrecked off Middle Island while sealing in late 1824. The crew unsuccessfully attempted to reach &lt;a href=\"Sydney%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in two boats, and were eventually rescued by the \"Nereus\". The schooner \"Liberty\" salvaged the wreck the following year collecting metal stores and both the anchors. \"The Mountaineer\" was sunk off Thistle Cove near &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Le%20Grand%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cape Le Grand&lt;/a&gt; in 1835 while attempting to find shelter from a gale. \"The Rodondo\" was thought to be wrecked on Polloch Reef off Salisbury Island in 1895. The SS \"Penguin\" was wrecked in 1920 off Middle Island while trying to shelter from a gale. The vessel was salvaged later the following year. On 14 February 1991 the \"&lt;a href=\"Sanko%20Harvest\"&gt;Sanko Harvest&lt;/a&gt;\" a bulk carrier of 33,024 tons sank in the archipelago \u2013 and it became the second largest wreck that can be dived on in the world. The response to pollution caused by the wreck was reported upon soon after.\nUses of the area now include recreational and commercial fishing, and shipping from the Port of Esperance. Commercial fishing is primarily for &lt;a href=\"abalone\"&gt;abalone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jasus%20edwardsii\"&gt;southern rock lobster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pilchard\"&gt;pilchard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s, and fishing tourism is an established industry. The area is proposed for other applications of &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt;, including farming trials of &lt;a href=\"bluefin%20tuna\"&gt;bluefin tuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe &lt;a href=\"archipelago\"&gt;archipelago&lt;/a&gt; includes 105 features classed as islands, and more than 1500 islets. The islands of the archipelago have a combined area of .\nThe islands are generally composed of granite outcrops, often with steep slopes and usually lacking beaches. A large number of features are submerged, some becoming exposed by tides.\nThe coast is subject to some of the most extreme wave energy in all of Australia, with the wave energy causing abrasion as far down as during storms. The inner shelf of the archipelago has an average depth of with most of the islands being in of water. &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Island%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Middle Island&lt;/a&gt; with an area of is the largest island in the Archipelago.\nGroups.\nThe islands are usually considered as being either in the western group, near Esperance and Woody Island and Cape Le Grand National Park, or in the eastern group where Middle Island is most prominent, near Cape Arid National Park. Some surveys of the archipelago go further than the eastern and western distinction and consider groupings around named islands, such as the Woody Group and the Remark Group.\nPart of the area is included in the bioregion described as Esperance 2 (ESP2), the 'Recherche subregion', which contains &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Le%20Grand%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cape Le Grand National Park&lt;/a&gt; at its western end, and the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Arid%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cape Arid National Park&lt;/a&gt; at the eastern end. This area is named the \"Recherche Archipelago Nature Reserve\".\nIslands.\nTour operator Don MacKenzie was granted permission to land passengers on &lt;a href=\"Woody%20Island%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Woody Island&lt;/a&gt; in 1973. The MacKenzie family built the jetty that is still used for visitors to disembark from tourist boats.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe area is a biodiversity hotspot with high &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; and a large number of species that are native to the region. The environment contains a diverse array of &lt;a href=\"subtropical\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; flora and fauna. This is partly due to the &lt;a href=\"Leeuwin%20Current\"&gt;Leeuwin current&lt;/a&gt; that flows in an easterly direction, this warms the cold seas to over in summer.\nLarger islands have a &lt;a href=\"Substrate%20%28biology%29\"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt; that supports vegetation, nesting birds, and other animals. A complex marine environment is found in the surrounding waters, the &lt;a href=\"benthic\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; habitat is various densities of &lt;a href=\"seagrass%20meadow\"&gt;seagrass meadow&lt;/a&gt;s, reefs, or bare sand.\nMarine.\nThe waters around the islands meet often steep faces of granite, the extensive reefs and other features form habitat which supports a rich diversity of marine life. This includes 263 known species of fish, 347 known species of mollusc, and over 450 types of &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20grass\"&gt;sea grass&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"soft%20coral\"&gt;soft coral&lt;/a&gt;s. A coral-like algae species, &lt;a href=\"rhodolith\"&gt;rhodolith&lt;/a&gt;s, form beds which support marine species of spiders, snails, and worms, also acting as a creche for &lt;a href=\"scallop\"&gt;scallop&lt;/a&gt;s. Marine mammals associated with the islands include two species of &lt;a href=\"Pinniped\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;, large groups of &lt;a href=\"common%20dolphin\"&gt;common dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Delphinus delphis\"), and &lt;a href=\"minke%20whale\"&gt;minke whale&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Balaenoptera acutorostrata\").\nSeagrasses found at the island include: \"&lt;a href=\"Amphibolis%20antarctica\"&gt;Amphibolis antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amphibolis%20griffithii\"&gt;Amphibolis griffithii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halophila%20decipiens\"&gt;Halophila decipiens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halophila%20ovalis\"&gt;Halophila ovalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20angustifolia\"&gt;Posidonia angustifolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20australis\"&gt;Posidonia australis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20coriacea\"&gt;Posidonia coriacea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20denhartogii\"&gt;Posidonia denhartogii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20kirkmani\"&gt;Posidonia kirkmani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20ostenfeldii\"&gt;Posidonia ostenfeldii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Posidonia%20sinuosa\"&gt;Posidonia sinuosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syringodium%20isoetifolium\"&gt;Syringodium isoetifolium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thalassodendron%20pachyrhizum\"&gt;Thalassodendron pachyrhizum&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTerrestrial.\nThe islands support populations of terrestrial flora and fauna, some of which are unique to the archipelago.\nNew Zealand fur seal (\"&lt;a href=\"Arctocephalus%20forsteri\"&gt;Arctocephalus forsteri&lt;/a&gt;\") and Australian sea-lion (\"&lt;a href=\"Neophoca%20cinerea\"&gt;Neophoca cinerea&lt;/a&gt;\") breeding colonies are found on some islands, with &lt;a href=\"hauling-out\"&gt;haul-out&lt;/a&gt; sites on many. Marsupials include &lt;a href=\"tammar\"&gt;tammar&lt;/a&gt;s (\"&lt;a href=\"Macropus%20eugenii%20derbianus\"&gt;Macropus eugenii derbianus&lt;/a&gt;\"), a species of bandicoot (\"&lt;a href=\"Isoodon%20obesulus\"&gt;Isoodon obesulus&lt;/a&gt;\"), two subspecies of rock wallabies (\"&lt;a href=\"Petrogale%20lateralis%20lateralis\"&gt;Petrogale lateralis lateralis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Petrogale%20lateralis%20hacketti\"&gt;Petrogale lateralis hacketti&lt;/a&gt;\"). Snakes include the Recherche Island dugite (\"&lt;a href=\"Pseudonaja%20affinis%20tanneri\"&gt;Pseudonaja affinis tanneri&lt;/a&gt;\") on &lt;a href=\"Cull%20Island\"&gt;Cull Island&lt;/a&gt;, and the python \"&lt;a href=\"Morelia%20spilota%20imbricata\"&gt;Morelia spilota imbricata&lt;/a&gt;\". Other reptiles include the barking gecko (\"&lt;a href=\"Underwoodisaurus%20milii\"&gt;Underwoodisaurus milii&lt;/a&gt;\"), ornate dragon (\"&lt;a href=\"Ctenophorus%20ornatus\"&gt;Ctenophorus ornatus&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the southern heath monitor (\"&lt;a href=\"Varanus%20rosenbergi\"&gt;Varanus rosenbergi&lt;/a&gt;\"). Two species of frog are also found on the islands; the quacking frog \"&lt;a href=\"Crinia%20georgiana\"&gt;Crinia georgiana&lt;/a&gt;\" and spotted-thighed frog \"&lt;a href=\"Litoria%20cyclorhyncha\"&gt;Litoria cyclorhyncha&lt;/a&gt;\".:\nMany of the animals and plants are in &lt;a href=\"Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29\"&gt;refugia&lt;/a&gt;, where they are remote from factors that threaten mainland populations.\nBirds.\nThe archipelago has been identified by &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Important%20Bird%20Area\"&gt;Important Bird Area&lt;/a&gt; (IBA) because it is the only breeding site for the western subspecies of Cape Barren goose known as the &lt;a href=\"Cereopsis%20novaehollandiae%20grisea\"&gt;Recherche Cape Barren goose&lt;/a&gt;. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of &lt;a href=\"flesh-footed%20shearwater\"&gt;flesh-footed shearwater&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sooty%20oystercatcher\"&gt;sooty oystercatcher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fairy%20tern\"&gt;fairy tern&lt;/a&gt;s and, probably, &lt;a href=\"white-faced%20storm-petrel\"&gt;white-faced storm-petrel&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20parrot\"&gt;Rock parrot&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Neophema petrophila\") and &lt;a href=\"red-eared%20firetail\"&gt;red-eared firetail&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Stagonopleura oculata\") have also been recorded."
