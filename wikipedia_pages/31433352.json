He officiated in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20vs%20Country%20Origin\"&gt;City vs Country Origin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"All%20Stars%20Match\"&gt;All Stars Match&lt;/a&gt;es, the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2010%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2013%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2014%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2014 NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEarly career.\nHayne spent most of his early life in &lt;a href=\"Muswellbrook%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Muswellbrook&lt;/a&gt;, his family having moved there in 1968. \nHe went to South Muswellbrook Primary School, then Muswellbrook High School. \nAs a child, Hayne played &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, before making a career in the latter sport.\nHe played for the &lt;a href=\"Muswellbrook%20Rams\"&gt;Muswellbrook Rams&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Group%2021%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Group 21&lt;/a&gt; competition, up until his retirement in 1994 after losing the grand final for a third time running.\nHayne obtained his state-school refereeing badge at the age of 16, and his senior badge at the age of 18. He soon became one of the top referees in the &lt;a href=\"Group%2021%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Group 21&lt;/a&gt; competition. In 2000, Hayne joined the NRL's referee recruitment program, travelling 526\u00a0km for training once a week until he re-located to the Central Coast.\nFirst grade career.\nShayne had shown promise as a Country Rugby League referee, and he furthered his career by travelling from Muswellbrook to Sydney, multiple times a week. \nHayne made his &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; d\u00e9but on 10 March 2001 at ANZ Stadium in a match between the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2003, Hayne became the source of some controversy when he appeared to lose control of a game between the &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta Eels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cronulla%20Sharks\"&gt;Cronulla Sharks&lt;/a&gt;. The result resulted in a 70 point victory, due to the Sharks being reduced to 10 men at one part of the game\nHe became one of the main referees in the game, including refereeing the 2007 City v Country game at Coffs Harbour, and then, as a surprise pick ahead of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Simpkins\"&gt;Paul Simpkins&lt;/a&gt;, Game II of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20State%20of%20Origin%20series\"&gt;2007 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;. Simpkins was picked to referee the following Origin game. Hayne, along with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Archer%20%28referee%29\"&gt;Tony Archer&lt;/a&gt;, refereed the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NRL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;NRL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. This was the first grand final to feature two referees.\nIn 2011, Hayne was overlooked for the 2011 Grand Final, withe NRL going with &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Cecchin\"&gt;Matt Cecchin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Archer%20%28referee%29\"&gt;Tony Archer&lt;/a&gt;, despite being referee of the year.\nHe announced his retirement on 12 November 2014.
