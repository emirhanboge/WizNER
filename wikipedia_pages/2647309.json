    "text": "Minoru Miki (, 16 March 19308 December 2011) was a Japanese &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and artistic director, particularly known for his promotional activities in favor of Japanese (as well as &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;n) traditional &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;instruments&lt;/a&gt; and some of their performers.\nBiography.\nHis vast catalogue, where aforementioned traditional instruments figure profusely either solo or in various types of ensemble with or without Western instruments, demonstrates large stylistic and formal diversity. It includes &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s and several types of stage music as well as &lt;a href=\"orchestra\"&gt;orchestra&lt;/a&gt;l, &lt;a href=\"concerto\"&gt;concerto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; and solo music, and music for &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;s. Miki was probably the second best known Japanese composer overseas after &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dru%20Takemitsu\"&gt;T\u014dru Takemitsu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was a pioneer in the composition of &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20classical%20music\"&gt;contemporary classical music&lt;/a&gt; for large ensembles of &lt;a href=\"traditional%20Japanese%20musical%20instruments\"&gt;traditional Japanese musical instruments&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964 he founded the Nihon Ongaku Sh\u016bdan (Pro Musica Nipponia ensemble), also known as Ensemble Nipponia, for which he has composed extensively.\nMiki was born in &lt;a href=\"Tokushima\"&gt;Tokushima&lt;/a&gt; on March 16, 1930. His first musical experiences were connected with the traditional music of his region. He had no formal music education before he moved to &lt;a href=\"Okayama\"&gt;Okayama&lt;/a&gt; for high school, where he first had contact with European classical music. From there he moved to &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, graduating from &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20University%20of%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Tokyo University of the Arts&lt;/a&gt; in 1964.\nThat year, Miki founded Pro musica Nipponia (), an orchestra of traditional Japanese instruments for which he would compose a large number of works. He also began cooperation with &lt;a href=\"koto%20%28musical%20instrument%29\"&gt;koto&lt;/a&gt; virtuoso &lt;a href=\"Keiko%20Nosaka\"&gt;Keiko Nosaka&lt;/a&gt;, developing the 20-string koto and reviving the instrument's repertoire with many new works in a variety of genres and combinations, including five concertos for koto and orchestra.\nMiki composed his first opera, \"Shunkinsho\" (based on &lt;a href=\"Jun%27ichir%C5%8D%20Tanizaki\"&gt;Tanizaki&lt;/a&gt;'s eponymous novel), in 1975. Interest by members of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Music%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;English Music Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese traditional music led to contacts with Miki, which resulted in the commission of the opera \"Ada, An Actor's Revenge\", to an English libretto by &lt;a href=\"James%20Kirkup\"&gt;James Kirkup&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ada\" premiered in London in 1979 and was one of the last works commissioned and performed by the EMTC before its ultimate disbandment in 1980. During this period, Miki developed a relationship with director &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Graham\"&gt;Colin Graham&lt;/a&gt; that was to last until the latter's death in 2007. The most notable result of this cooperation was the opera \"&lt;a href=\"J%C5%8Druri%20%28opera%29\"&gt;J\u014druri&lt;/a&gt;\", commissioned by Graham for the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Theatre%20of%20Saint%20Louis\"&gt;Opera Theatre of Saint Louis&lt;/a&gt; (where he had moved following the disbandment of the EMTC) and premiered there in 1985.\nFrom 1992 with \"Wakahime\", Miki turned to a pan-Asian perspective, incorporating music and instruments from a number of Asian countries in his compositions and collaborating with a number of Asian artists. Some of Miki's operas from then on \u2013 and notably \"Wakahime\" and \"Aien\" \u2013 also increasingly tend to deal with episodes of Japan's presence and interaction with its Asian neighbouring countries, often incorporating the use on stage and within the plot of such countries' traditional instruments.\nMiki died of &lt;a href=\"sepsis\"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mitaka%2C%20Tokyo\"&gt;Mitaka&lt;/a&gt; city hospital, in Tokyo, during the early hours of 8 December 2011."
