    "text": "\"Going to Meet the Man\" is a short story by American author &lt;a href=\"James%20Baldwin\"&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;. It was published in 1965 in the short story collection &lt;a href=\"Going%20to%20Meet%20the%20Man\"&gt;of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot summary.\nJesse is a &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheriff\"&gt;deputy sheriff&lt;/a&gt; in a small &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; town. As the story opens, he is lying in bed with his wife, Grace. The two attempt to have sex but Jesse is unable to achieve an &lt;a href=\"erection\"&gt;erection&lt;/a&gt;. Frustrated, Jesse imagines the dirtier things that he could force a &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; woman to do. The plot then proceeds in a series of &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20%28narrative%29\"&gt;flashbacks&lt;/a&gt;.\nJesse first remembers a scene from earlier that day. He and a character named Big Jim C. had arrested a young black &lt;a href=\"Civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;Civil Rights&lt;/a&gt; leader in town. \"They had this line you know, to register, and they wouldn't stay where Big Jim C. wanted them\", Jesse recounts to a half-sleeping Grace. Jesse visits the young man in his jail cell. He beats him, shocks him with a &lt;a href=\"cattle%20prod\"&gt;cattle prod&lt;/a&gt;, and declares, \"you are going to stop coming down to the court house and disrupting traffic and molesting the people and keeping us from our duties and keeping doctors from getting to sick white women and getting all them Northerners in this town to give our town a bad name\u2014!\"\nAs Jesse is about to leave the cell, the Civil Rights leader, now barely conscious, says to him, \"You remember Old Julia?\" Old Julia had been one of Jesse's mail-order recipients in a previous job (a job in which he had deliberately exploited black customers). Jesse suddenly realizes that he'd met the young man years before: he's Old Julia's grandson. Even as a child, Jesse had perceived him to be insolent and disrespectful. Enraged, Jesse beats him again and exclaims, \"You lucky we \"pump\" some white blood into you every once in a while\u2014your women!\" Jesse then grabs his crotch, and feels his own penis \"violently stiffen\".\nStill in bed with Grace, Jesse then thinks more generally about how the &lt;a href=\"Culture\"&gt;cultural climate&lt;/a&gt; in the South has changed. &lt;a href=\"White%20supremacy\"&gt;White supremacy&lt;/a&gt; had once been the status quo, but now white folks seem less certain of their inherent superiority. Local black folks have become agitated, and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20United%20States\"&gt;Northerners&lt;/a&gt; have taken an active role in Southern politics. Jesse laments these changes. He tells himself that he's doing God's work, \"[p]rotecting white people from the &lt;a href=\"Nigger\"&gt;niggers&lt;/a&gt; and the niggers from themselves\", but admits that he \"misse[s] the ease of former years\" when white folks could be more open about their &lt;a href=\"racism\"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen, \"out of nowhere\", Jesse recalls the lyrics to an old slave song, \"&lt;a href=\"Wade%20in%20the%20Water\"&gt;Wade in the Water&lt;/a&gt;\". This initiates one final flashback to when Jesse was eight years old, riding in a car with his mother and father. The family had heard the song as they passed by a black neighborhood. \"I guess they singing for him\", Jesse's father says. To whom \"him\" refers is vague. As a child, Jesse had had a black friend named Otis. He realizes that he has not seen Otis\u2014nor any other black people\u2014for several days, but he does not understand why. \"I reckon Otis's folks was afraid to let him show himself\", his father says.\nThe next morning, the white folks in town all gather to witness the brutal &lt;a href=\"lynching\"&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt; of a black man. Jesse sits on his father's shoulders and watches as the man is &lt;a href=\"Castration\"&gt;castrated&lt;/a&gt; and burned alive. Whatever offense the man may have committed is never revealed. The scene is gruesome and violent yet treated as a good-natured spectacle for the whites, who leave the charred and mutilated body to rot while they settle down for a picnic.\nAs he remembers this scene, Jesse looks at Grace with renewed vigor. \"Come on sugar\", he says, \"I'm going to do you like a nigger, just like a nigger, come on, sugar, and love me just like you'd love a nigger\". The story ends as Jesse has sex with Grace \"harder than he ever had before\".\nInterpretation.\nSeveral elements in the story allude to the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Movement\"&gt;American Civil Rights Movement&lt;/a&gt; of the 1950s and early 1960s. The character Big Jim C., for example, is almost certainly a &lt;a href=\"personification\"&gt;personification&lt;/a&gt; of the so-called &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt; laws that enforced &lt;a href=\"racial%20segregation\"&gt;racial segregation&lt;/a&gt; in the South. Many of these laws remained in effect until the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964\"&gt;Civil Rights Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1964 and the &lt;a href=\"Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965\"&gt;Voting Rights Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1965. When Jesse claims that the blacks \"had this line you know, to register\", the implication is that they wanted to register \"to vote\" and therefore \"wouldn't stay where [Jim Crow] wanted them\"\u2014i.e., lacking any political or economic agency. \n\"Jim C.\" could more specifically (or in addition) refer to &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Clark%20%28sheriff%29\"&gt;Jim Clark&lt;/a&gt;, sheriff of &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20County%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; from 1955 to 1966. Clark is widely remembered as a racist who employed violent methods (such as cattle prods) against Civil Rights protesters. \nThe lynching at the end of the story is a reference to the Lynching of Jesse Washington, in Waco Texas on May 15, 1916.\nPerhaps the most notable &lt;a href=\"Formalism%20%28literature%29\"&gt;formal&lt;/a&gt; aspect of the story is Baldwin's decision to &lt;a href=\"Focalisation\"&gt;focalize&lt;/a&gt; it through the point-of-view of a white police officer. Jesse does not seem to possess a conventional &lt;a href=\"character%20arc\"&gt;character arc&lt;/a&gt; in which he changes in any significant way throughout the story. By the end he appears to copulate with his wife without gaining a deeper understanding of himself or overcoming his &lt;a href=\"racism\"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons for this may be complex. Baldwin himself was black, and during a 1965 debate with conservative intellectual &lt;a href=\"William%20F.%20Buckley%20Jr.\"&gt;William F. Buckley Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, he said the following about whites in the American South:\nThis is a controversial statement, but it centers on the idea that the relationship of &lt;a href=\"oppression\"&gt;oppression&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps more &lt;a href=\"Dehumanization\"&gt;dehumanizing&lt;/a&gt; to the oppressor than to the oppressed. As such, Baldwin suggests that while Southern blacks may have had their bodies enslaved, Southern whites have had their \"minds\" enslaved by &lt;a href=\"white%20supremacy\"&gt;white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. \nA &lt;a href=\"Psychoanalytic%20literary%20criticism\"&gt;psychoanalytic&lt;/a&gt; reading of the &lt;a href=\"narrative%20structure\"&gt;narrative structure&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Jesse's racism is not only irrational, but the result of &lt;a href=\"Repression%20%28psychology%29\"&gt;repression&lt;/a&gt;. The story begins with a &lt;a href=\"symptom\"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt;: namely Jesse's inability to achieve an erection. He does not comprehend the cause of this phenomenon, and so \"works through\" a series of associated memories, each time implicitly linking sexuality and violence (e.g., feeling his penis \"violently stiffen\" upon beating the young black man). What &lt;a href=\"Sigmund%20Freud\"&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt; would call the \"&lt;a href=\"primal%20scene\"&gt;primal scene&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014i.e., a traumatizing event in the child's early &lt;a href=\"psychosexual%20development\"&gt;psychosexual development&lt;/a&gt;\u2014is recovered at the end when Jesse remembers having attended the lynching. Eight-year-old Jesse even fixates on the black man's penis:\nJesse's racism could thus be interpreted as the result of a &lt;a href=\"psychological%20trauma\"&gt;psychological trauma&lt;/a&gt;, which helps to explain why, upon finally returning to the \"present\", he fantasizes about being black in order to perform sexually with his wife. Much like how the &lt;a href=\"Oedipus%20complex\"&gt;Oedipal&lt;/a&gt; father figure represents the threat of castration, the &lt;a href=\"stereotype\"&gt;stereotype&lt;/a&gt; of black men's sexual prowess\u2014figuring in the description of the man's penis being \"much bigger than his father's\"\u2014informs both Jesse's fear of empowering blacks as well as his perverse desire \"to be\" black. \nAs such, \"Going to Meet the Man\" suggests that Jesse's racism is so deep-seated that not only does it structure his political &lt;a href=\"World%20view\"&gt;worldview&lt;/a&gt;, but his entire personality. This type of racism is difficult to overcome, and it is in this way that Baldwin dramatizes the idea that what has happened to Southern whites is actually worse than what has happened to Southern blacks. In the same debate with William F. Buckley Jr., in fact, Baldwin claims that \"[t]he white &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; or Mississippi &lt;a href=\"Sharecropping\"&gt;sharecropper&lt;/a&gt; or Alabama sheriff has at bottom a system of reality which compels them really to believe when they face the Negro that this woman, this man, this child must be insane to attack the system to which he owes his entire identity\". We can see this notion operative in Jesse's inability to understand why black folks would want to upset the social order, as well as in his outright hostility towards any challenge to white male dominance. In this respect, despite the horrible things he does, Jesse can be interpreted as a &lt;a href=\"Tragic%20hero\"&gt;tragic figure&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a victim of the very racist &lt;a href=\"ideology\"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt; he perpetuates."
