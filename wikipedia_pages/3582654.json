    "text": "A sexual minority is a group whose &lt;a href=\"sexual%20identity\"&gt;sexual identity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;orientation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"human%20sexual%20behavior\"&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt; differ from the majority of the surrounding society. Primarily used to refer to &lt;a href=\"LGBT\"&gt;lesbian, gay, bisexual&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"non-heterosexual\"&gt;non-heterosexual&lt;/a&gt; individuals, it can also refer to &lt;a href=\"transgender\"&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"non-binary%20gender\"&gt;non-binary&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"third%20gender\"&gt;third gender&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"intersex\"&gt;intersex&lt;/a&gt; individuals.\nVariants include GSM (\"Gender and Sexual Minorities\"), GSRM (\"Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities\") , and GSD (\"&lt;a href=\"Gender%20and%20Sexual%20Diversity\"&gt;Gender and Sexual Diversity&lt;/a&gt;\"). They have been considered in academia, but it is SGM (\"Sexual and Gender Minority\") that has gained the most advancement since 2014. In 2015, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Institutes%20of%20Health\"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; announced the formation of the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office and numerous professional and academic institutions have adopted this term.\n\"Sexual and gender minority\" is an umbrella term that encompasses populations included in the acronym \"LGBTI\" (&lt;a href=\"lesbian\"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gay\"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bisexual\"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;, transgender and intersex), and those whose sexual orientation or gender identity varies. It includes those who may not self-identify as LGBTI (e.g., &lt;a href=\"queer\"&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Questioning%20%28sexuality%20and%20gender%29\"&gt;questioning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"two-spirit\"&gt;two-spirit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asexuality\"&gt;asexual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"men%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20men\"&gt;men who have sex with men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gender%20variant\"&gt;gender variant&lt;/a&gt;), or those who have a specific medical condition affecting reproductive development (e.g., individuals with differences or &lt;a href=\"disorders%20of%20sex%20development\"&gt;disorders of sex development&lt;/a&gt;, who sometimes identify as intersex).\nOrigins.\nThe term \"sexual minority\" was most likely coined in the late 1960s under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Ullerstam\"&gt;Lars Ullerstam&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"The Erotic Minorities: A Swedish View\", which is strongly in favor of tolerance and empathy to &lt;a href=\"paraphilia\"&gt;paraphilia&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"paedophilia\"&gt;paedophilia&lt;/a&gt; and uncommon sexualities in which people were labeled \"sex criminals\". The term was used as analogous to &lt;a href=\"ethnic\"&gt;ethnic minority&lt;/a&gt;.\nScientists such as &lt;a href=\"Ritch%20Savin-Williams\"&gt;Ritch Savin-Williams&lt;/a&gt; support using the term in order to accurately describe adolescent youths who may not identify as any common culturally-defined &lt;a href=\"sexual%20identity\"&gt;sexual identity&lt;/a&gt; label (&lt;a href=\"lesbian\"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gay\"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bisexual\"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;, \"et cetera\") but who still have attractions towards those of the same &lt;a href=\"anatomical%20sex\"&gt;anatomical sex&lt;/a&gt; as themselves.\nAssociated health and social issues.\nStress.\nSocial issues may lead to possible health and psychological issues, especially in youth. It has been found that sexual minorities face increased stress due to &lt;a href=\"Social%20stigma\"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt;s. This stigma-related stress creates elevated coping regulation and social and cognitive processes leading to risk for psychopathology.\nRisky behavior.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control\"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) published their 2015 study of large cohorts of ninth to twelfth grade students across the US. One hundred health behaviors were shown to put LGB students at risk for health consequences. Sexual minority students engage in more risky behaviors when compared with nonsexual minority students. Some students \"...had no sexual contact [and] were excluded from analyses on sexual behaviors [including] female students who had sexual contact with only females [and] were excluded from analyses on condom use and birth control use...\" Also excluded were \"...male students who had sexual contact with only males [and] were excluded from analyses on birth control use.\" One small study showed that LGBT adolescents were victimized more often, had higher rates of &lt;a href=\"psychopathology\"&gt;psychopathology&lt;/a&gt;, left home more frequently, used highly addictive substances more frequently, and were more likely to have more &lt;a href=\"multiple%20sex%20partners\"&gt;multiple sex partners&lt;/a&gt; than heterosexual adolescents.\nDevelopment.\nBased on studies of adolescents, it is concluded that sexual minorities are similar to heterosexual adolescents in developmental needs and concerns. However, research has suggested that sexual minority youth (more specifically LGBT youth) are more susceptible to psychological and health issues than heterosexual youth.\nEpidemiology.\nSexual minorities tend to use &lt;a href=\"alternative%20and%20complementary%20medicine\"&gt;alternative and complementary medicine&lt;/a&gt; alternative methods of addressing their health needs more often than heterosexuals. Sexual minority women have a higher incidence of &lt;a href=\"asthma\"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obesity\"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arthritis\"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cardiovascular%20disease\"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; than other groups.\nAdolescent sexual minorities report a higher incidence of the following when compared to heterosexual students:\nWhen compared to the general population, sexual minorities have a higher risk for self-injury. The treatment of aging sexual minorities seems to be influenced more by ageism. Support for aging sexual minorities appears to be common.\nDiscrimination.\nWhen gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults reported being discriminated against, forty-two percent credited it to their &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. This discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity. \nIn the media.\nSexual minorities are generally portrayed in the mass media as being ignored, trivialized, or condemned. The term &lt;a href=\"symbolic%20annihilation\"&gt;symbolic annihilation&lt;/a&gt; accounts for their lack of characterization due to not fitting into the white, heterosexual, vanilla type lifestyle. It has been suggested that online media has developed into a space in which sexual minorities may use \u201csocial artillery\u201d. This description centers on how social networking and connections to oppose instances of homophobia. Still, some individuals have made their way into the media through television and music. TV shows such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show\"&gt;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&lt;/a&gt; and ABC\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Family\"&gt;Modern Family&lt;/a&gt; star individuals who are open about their non-heterosexual lifestyles. In music, people like &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Smith%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Sam Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sia%20Furler\"&gt;Sia&lt;/a&gt; have created songs that express their &lt;a href=\"emotion\"&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt;s and sexuality with a number of followers. While sexual minorities do have a place in the media, it is often critiqued that they are still limited in their representations. In shows, if a character is gay, they are often a very shallow character that is only present for comic relief or as a plot twist. Compared to a heteronormative counterpart, the sexual minority is often a mere side-kick. However, since the integration of actors, musicians, and characters of sexual minorities, the idea of non-normativity has become more normalized in society.\nCultural issues.\nCurrent and past research has been \"skewed toward SM men\u2014and is disproportionately focused on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\" Between 1989 and 2011, numerous grants for research were sponsored and funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) but funded research for sexual minorities and health made up 0.1% of all funded studies. Most research has been directed toward gay and bisexual men. Women sexual minority studies accounted for only 13.5%.\nSexual minorities in South Africa have sexual-orientation-related health inequities when compared to other countries. One of the highest prevalences of sexual violence directed toward women of a sexual minority occurs in South Africa. Women of color who are living in low income urban areas are notably targeted. The perpetrators of sexual violence believe they are \"correcting the women,\" and their actions will cure them of their homosexuality.\nControversy.\nSome LGBT people object to using the term \"sexual minorities\" and prefer the term LGBT. Reasons for these objections may vary. For example, some LGBT people feel that the term \"sexual minority\" reminds them about discrimination and about being a minority. They want to be not a distinct minority but an integral and respectable part of the society. Some other LGBT people dislike the term for being too inclusive, including &lt;a href=\"Swinging%20%28sexual%20practice%29\"&gt;swinger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Polyamory\"&gt;polyamorist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"BDSM\"&gt;BDSM&lt;/a&gt; people and other perceived \"sexual strangers\". These LGBT people want to make a larger distance between these sexual practices and bisexuality/homosexuality/transgender.\nSome &lt;a href=\"transgender\"&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"transsexual\"&gt;transsexual&lt;/a&gt; people dislike the term \"sexual minority\" for yet another reason. They argue that the phenomenon of transsexuality or transgender has nothing to do with sex, sexual practices or &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;, but it relates to the &lt;a href=\"gender\"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, gender dysphoria and gender-variant behavior or feelings. Thus, they feel it is incorrect to classify them as \"sexual minority\", when, in fact, they are &lt;a href=\"Gender%20variance\"&gt;gender-variant&lt;/a&gt; minority.\nSome &lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; groups oppose the use of the term \"sexual minority\" for completely different reasons. They think or feel that the term inherently implies some degree of legalisation or protection for those engaged in such sexual practices, much like ethnic minorities are protected from being discriminated or persecuted in modern democratic countries.\nSome people dislike the term because it includes \"minority\", when the fact is that not all these categories are really about minorities but actually about \"minorised\" groups.\nOthers referred to as \"sexual minorities\" include &lt;a href=\"sexual%20fetishism\"&gt;fetishists&lt;/a&gt; and practitioners in of &lt;a href=\"BDSM\"&gt;BDSM (bondage, dominance, and submission)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sadism%20and%20masochism\"&gt;sadism and masochism&lt;/a&gt;. The term may also include &lt;a href=\"asexuality\"&gt;asexuals&lt;/a&gt; and people whose choice of partner or partners is atypical, such as &lt;a href=\"Swinging%20%28sexual%20practice%29\"&gt;swingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polyamory\"&gt;polyamorists&lt;/a&gt; or people in other &lt;a href=\"Forms%20of%20nonmonogamy\"&gt;nonmonogamous relationship&lt;/a&gt;s, and those who have &lt;a href=\"age%20disparity%20in%20sexual%20relationships\"&gt;partners significantly older or younger than themselves&lt;/a&gt;. It may also refer to people who are in a &lt;a href=\"mixed-race%20relationship\"&gt;mixed-race relationship&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsually, the term \"sexual minority\" is applied only to groups who practice &lt;a href=\"Informed%20consent%23Sex\"&gt;consensual sex&lt;/a&gt;: for example, it would be unusual to refer to &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rapists&lt;/a&gt; as a sexual minority, but the term would generally include someone whose sexuality gave a major, fetishized role to consensual playing out of a &lt;a href=\"rape%20fantasy\"&gt;rape fantasy&lt;/a&gt;. Also, someone who very occasionally incorporates of consensual &lt;a href=\"kink%20%28sexual%29\"&gt;kink&lt;/a&gt; or same-sex activity into a largely vanilla, heterosexual sex life would not usually be described as a \"sexual minority\"."
