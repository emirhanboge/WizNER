Andre was offered a recording contract with Conehead Management following the success of his &lt;a href=\"ITV2\"&gt;ITV2&lt;/a&gt; fly-on-the-wall documentary, . Andre began recording with Conehead in January 2009. On 9 August 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"Behind%20Closed%20Doors%20%28Peter%20Andre%20song%29\"&gt;Behind Closed Doors&lt;/a&gt;\" was revealed as the first single from Andre's upcoming album.
