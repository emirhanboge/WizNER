    "text": "Area code 586 is the &lt;a href=\"telephone\"&gt;telephone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"area%20code\"&gt;area code&lt;/a&gt; serving much of &lt;a href=\"Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Macomb County, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in 2001 as a split from &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20810\"&gt;area code 810&lt;/a&gt;. Its territory was originally part of &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20313\"&gt;area code 313&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMacomb County was originally served by Detroit's &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20313\"&gt;area code 313&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20original%20NANP%20area%20codes\"&gt;original 86 area codes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Numbering%20Plan\"&gt;North American Numbering Plan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1993, &lt;a href=\"area%20code%20810\"&gt;area code 810&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Split%20plan\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; from 313; the service area of 810 initially included all of the former 313 outside of &lt;a href=\"Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Washtenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Washtenaw&lt;/a&gt; counties. \nIn 1997, &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Oakland County&lt;/a&gt;, bordering Macomb County to the west, was split from area code 810 as &lt;a href=\"Area%20codes%20248%20and%20947\"&gt;area code 248&lt;/a&gt;. Area code 586 was first proposed as an &lt;a href=\"Overlay%20plan\"&gt;overlay&lt;/a&gt; for the 810 territory, to be implemented in 2000. However, overlays were still a new concept at this time, and met with some resistance due to the need for &lt;a href=\"ten-digit%20dialing\"&gt;ten-digit dialing&lt;/a&gt;. In the face of intense opposition to the overlay proposal, 586 was instead implemented as a split, with most of Macomb County getting the new area code. The area code was introduced on September 22, 2001. &lt;a href=\"Permissive%20dialing\"&gt;Permissive dialing&lt;/a&gt; of 810 continued until March 23, 2002.\nService area.\nArea code 586 serves &lt;a href=\"Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Macomb County, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, including the following communities: "
