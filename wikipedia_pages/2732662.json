    "text": "Leonard Joseph Yochim (October 16, 1928 \u2013 May 11, 2013) was a &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He played in parts of two seasons in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; in 1951 and 1954, and later served in the organization for almost four decades. Yochim batted and threw left-handed.\nYochim was born and died in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. Highly touted by the Pittsburgh Pirates during his career, he was a &lt;a href=\"screwball\"&gt;screwball&lt;/a&gt; specialist and had a good &lt;a href=\"curveball\"&gt;curve&lt;/a&gt; as well, but a sore arm limited him to pitch in only 28.1 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt;. He pitched in two games in 1951 and ten in 1954, ending his major league career with a 1\u20132 record and a 7.62 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;ERA&lt;/a&gt; in 12 &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; (three as a &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starter&lt;/a&gt;).\nHis professional career highlight came on December 8, 1955, when he became the first pitcher to throw a &lt;a href=\"no-hitter\"&gt;no-hitter&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Venezuelan%20Professional%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Venezuelan Professional Baseball League&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Leones%20del%20Caracas\"&gt;Leones del Caracas&lt;/a&gt; club. Helped by &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Battey\"&gt;Earl Battey&lt;/a&gt;, Yochim accomplished the feat in the Caracas 3\u20130 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Navegantes%20del%20Magallanes\"&gt;Navegantes del Magallanes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Monzant\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Monzant&lt;/a&gt; was credited with the loss.\nBesides, he also played in the league for &lt;a href=\"Sabios%20de%20Vargas\"&gt;Vargas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gavilanes%20%28baseball%20club%29\"&gt;Gavilanes&lt;/a&gt; and Magallanes, compiling a 29\u201320 record and a 3.57 ERA in 86 games from 1952 through 1956, while pitching for Caracas in the &lt;a href=\"1953%20Caribbean%20Series\"&gt;1953 Caribbean Series&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his playing career, Yochim rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 1966 to become a member of their baseball operations department. He served as an area &lt;a href=\"scout%20%28sports%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;, national crosschecker and major-league scout for the Pirates before moving into the front office in 1994. Yochim also worked as a senior adviser for player personnel from 1994 through 2004, when he decided not to return for another season.\nHe was the older brother of former MLB pitcher and minor league manager and coach &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Yochim\"&gt;Ray Yochim&lt;/a&gt; ( 1922\u20132002)."
