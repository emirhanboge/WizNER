    "text": "Johan van Zyl Steyn, Baron Steyn, &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; (15 August 1932 \u2013 28 November 2017) was a &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n-&lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; judge, until September 2005 a &lt;a href=\"Law%20Lord\"&gt;Law Lord&lt;/a&gt;. He sat in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"crossbencher\"&gt;crossbencher&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nSteyn was born in &lt;a href=\"Stellenbosch\"&gt;Stellenbosch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Union of South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Janet Lacey Blignaut and Izak van Zyl Steyn, a professor of law at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Stellenbosch\"&gt;University of Stellenbosch&lt;/a&gt;. His father died before he turned three years old and he subsequently were sent to live with his paternal grandparents. He received his schooling at the &lt;a href=\"Ho%C3%ABrskool%20Jan%20van%20Riebeeck\"&gt;Ho\u00ebrskool Jan van Riebeeck&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; where he matriculated in 1950. He studied law at the University of Stellenbosch before reading Law as a &lt;a href=\"Rhodes%20Scholar\"&gt;Rhodes Scholar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"University%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;University College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHe was called to the &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28law%29\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa in 1958 and appointed a &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Counsel\"&gt;Senior Counsel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Supreme Court of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 1970.\nAs a result of his opposition to &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; in his native South Africa, he settled in the UK in 1973, joining the &lt;a href=\"English%20Bar\"&gt;English Bar&lt;/a&gt; and building a distinguished &lt;a href=\"international%20commercial%20law\"&gt;international commercial law&lt;/a&gt; practice. He married Susan Heard (n\u00e9e Lewis) in 1977, having two sons and two daughters from a previous marriage to Jean Pollard. He had eight grandchildren (from his first marriage) and three stepgrandchildren (from his second marriage). He was appointed &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Counsel\"&gt;Queen's Counsel&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 and was appointed a &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20judge%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29\"&gt;High Court Judge&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, receiving the customary &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt;, a surprise appointment by the then &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chancellor\"&gt;Lord Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quintin%20Hogg%2C%20Baron%20Hailsham%20of%20St%20Marylebone\"&gt;Lord Hailsham&lt;/a&gt;. He served as presiding judge of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Circuit\"&gt;Northern Circuit&lt;/a&gt; from 1989 to 1991 and was appointed &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Justice%20of%20Appeal\"&gt;Lord Justice of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; in 1992.\nOn 11 January 1995 he was elevated to a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Appeal%20in%20Ordinary\"&gt;Lord of Appeal in Ordinary&lt;/a&gt; and was created a &lt;a href=\"life%20peer\"&gt;life peer&lt;/a&gt; as Baron Steyn, of &lt;a href=\"Swafield\"&gt;Swafield&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Norfolk\"&gt;County of Norfolk&lt;/a&gt;. As a Law Lord he achieved prominence for his &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; views and espousal of &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;. He was a fierce critic of &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Pinochet\"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;'s claim to stand immune from prosecution. His record of open criticism of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20X-Ray\"&gt;Camp X-Ray&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Guantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp\"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; led to pressure from the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK government&lt;/a&gt; that he make himself unavailable for the hearing on the indefinite detention of suspects under the &lt;a href=\"Anti-terrorism%2C%20Crime%20and%20Security%20Act%202001\"&gt;Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&lt;/a&gt; that began on 4 October 2004. The decision in the latter case caused the government to review its policy of indefinite detention of terror suspects and led to the equally controversial Terrorism Bill 2005. His judicial work in the House of Lords has been instrumental in weaving the Human Rights Act 1998 into the fabric of English law. He also drew upon his background as a commercial lawyer.\nHis Hart Lecture of May 2000 was influential in its criticism of \"&lt;a href=\"Pepper%20%28Inspector%20of%20Taxes%29%20v%20Hart\"&gt;Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"case%20citation\"&gt;[1992] UKHL 3&lt;/a&gt;, a landmark decision of the &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; on the use of &lt;a href=\"legislative%20history\"&gt;legislative history&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"statutory%20interpretation\"&gt;statutory interpretation&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was one of the few senior judges to support calls for modernisation of the &lt;a href=\"English%20legal%20system\"&gt;English legal system&lt;/a&gt; and abolition of the role of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chancellor\"&gt;Lord Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;. While a Lord of Appeal he refrained from speaking in the House, instead expressing his views on democracy and human rights through judgments and lectures.\nHe retired as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary on 30 September 2005. &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Mance%2C%20Baron%20Mance\"&gt;Jonathan Mance&lt;/a&gt; was elevated from Lord Justice of Appeal on 1 October 2005 to replace him. Since his retirement he was for a period the chairman of the human rights organisation &lt;a href=\"JUSTICE\"&gt;JUSTICE&lt;/a&gt; and was vocal in his criticism of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Blair\"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s government and its approach to &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;. He had expressed grave misgivings over the proposed powers to allow detention without trial and about the use of existing anti-terror powers.\nDeath.\nOn 10th October 2021 as part of the traditional 'Wigs and Mitres Service' lecture at &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Lincoln's Inn&lt;/a&gt; Chapel his ashes were interred there."
