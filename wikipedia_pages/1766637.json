    "text": "Tacitean studies, centred on the work of &lt;a href=\"Tacitus\"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt; ( \u2013 ) the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Roman\"&gt;Ancient Roman&lt;/a&gt; historian, constitute an area of scholarship extending beyond the field of history. The work has traditionally been read for its moral instruction, its narrative, and its inimitable prose style; Tacitus has been (and still is) most influential as a political theorist, outside the field of history. The political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps (as identified by &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Toffanin\"&gt;Giuseppe Toffanin&lt;/a&gt;): the \"red Tacitists\", who used him to support &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; ideals, and the \"black Tacitists\", those who read his accounts as a lesson in &lt;a href=\"wikt%3AMachiavellian\"&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"realpolitik\"&gt;realpolitik&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough his work is the most reliable source for the history of his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned: the \"&lt;a href=\"Annals%20%28Tacitus%29\"&gt;Annals&lt;/a&gt;\" are based in part on secondary sources of unknown reliability, and there are some obvious minor mistakes (for instance confusing the two daughters of &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Antony\"&gt;Mark Antony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Octavia%20Minor\"&gt;Octavia Minor&lt;/a&gt;, both named Antonia). The \"&lt;a href=\"Histories%20%28Tacitus%29\"&gt;Histories&lt;/a&gt;\", written from primary documents and personal knowledge of the Flavian period, is thought to be more accurate, though Tacitus's hatred of &lt;a href=\"Domitian\"&gt;Domitian&lt;/a&gt; seemingly colored its tone and interpretations.\nAntiquity and Middle Ages.\nTacitus's contemporaries were well-acquainted with his work; &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Pliny the Younger&lt;/a&gt;, one of his first admirers, congratulated him for his better-than-usual precision and predicted that his \"Histories\" would be immortal: only a third of his known work has survived and then through a very tenuous textual tradition; we depend on a single manuscript for books I-VI of the \"Annales\" and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI-XVI) and for the five books extant of the \"Historiae\". His books were clearly used by 2nd-early 3rd century historians such as &lt;a href=\"Cassius%20Dio\"&gt;Cassius Dio&lt;/a&gt;'s report on Agricola's exploration of Britain, and &lt;a href=\"Hegesippus%20%28chronicler%29\"&gt;Hegesippus&lt;/a&gt; may have borrowed from his account of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Jewish%E2%80%93Roman%20War\"&gt;First Jewish\u2013Roman War&lt;/a&gt;. His difficult historical methods and elliptic literary style, however, went unimitated except by &lt;a href=\"Ammianus%20Marcellinus\"&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus&lt;/a&gt;, who consciously set out to write a continuation of his works. His popularity waned with time: his unfavorable portrayals of the early emperors could not have earned him favor with Rome's increasingly autocratic rulers, and his obvious contempt for &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; (both troublesome foreign cults in the eyes of a 1st-century Roman aristocrat) made him unpopular among the early &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt;. The 3rd-century writer &lt;a href=\"Tertullian\"&gt;Tertullian&lt;/a&gt;, for example, blames him (incorrectly\u2014see &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20anti-Semitism\"&gt;history of anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt;) for originating the story that the Jews worshipped a donkey's head in the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20of%20Holies\"&gt;Holy of Holies&lt;/a&gt; and calls him \"ille mendaciorum loquacissimus\", 'the most loquacious of liars'.\nIn the 4th century there are scattered references to his life and work. Flavius Vopiscus, one of the supposed \"&lt;a href=\"Augustan%20History\"&gt;Scriptores Historiae Augustae&lt;/a&gt;\", mentions him twice (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/1%2A.html%232\"&gt;\"Aurelian\" 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus%2A.html%232.7\"&gt;\"Probus\" 2.7.&lt;/a&gt;) and names him among the \"disertissimos viros\", the most eloquent men. Ammianus Marcellinus, as mentioned, started his history where Tacitus had finished. &lt;a href=\"Jerome\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt; knew of him, and &lt;a href=\"Sulpicius%20Severus\"&gt;Sulpicius Severus&lt;/a&gt; either used his &lt;a href=\"Annales%20%28Tacitus%29\"&gt;Annales&lt;/a&gt; as a source for passages on &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; or, according to Aurthur Drews, the passage in &lt;a href=\"Sulpicius%20Severus\"&gt;Sulpicius Severus&lt;/a&gt;'s Chronicles later found its way into &lt;a href=\"Annales%20%28Tacitus%29\"&gt;Annales&lt;/a&gt;. By the 5th century only a few authors seem aware of him: &lt;a href=\"Sidonius%20Apollinaris\"&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris&lt;/a&gt;, who admires him, and &lt;a href=\"Paulus%20Orosius\"&gt;Orosius&lt;/a&gt;, who alternately derides him as a fool and borrows passages (including many that are otherwise lost) from his works. &lt;a href=\"Cassiodorus\"&gt;Cassiodorus&lt;/a&gt; and his disciple &lt;a href=\"Jordanes\"&gt;Jordanes&lt;/a&gt; (middle of the 6th century) make the last known antique references; Cassiodorus draws on parts of the \"Germania\" and Jordanes cites the \"Agricola\", but both know the author only as \"Cornelius\".\nAfter Jordanes, Tacitus disappeared from literature for the better part of two centuries, and only four certain references appear until 1360. Two come from &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; monks of the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Carolingian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;: the \"&lt;a href=\"Annales%20Fuldenses\"&gt;Annales Fuldenses&lt;/a&gt;\" from the &lt;a href=\"Fulda\"&gt;monastery of Fulda&lt;/a&gt; used Tacitus's \"Annals\", and &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20of%20Fulda\"&gt;Rudolf of Fulda&lt;/a&gt; borrowed from the \"Germania\" for his \"Translatio Sancti Alexandri\". Some of Tacitus's works were known at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cassino\"&gt;Monte Cassino&lt;/a&gt; by 1100, where the other two certain references appear: &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Deacon\"&gt;Peter the Deacon&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Vita Sancti Severi\" used the \"Agricola\", and &lt;a href=\"Paulinus%20Venetus\"&gt;Paulinus Venetus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Pozzuoli\"&gt;Bishop of Pozzuoli&lt;/a&gt;, plagiarized passages from the \"Annals\" in his \"&lt;a href=\"mappa%20mundi\"&gt;mappa mundi&lt;/a&gt;\". Hints and reminiscences of Tacitus appear in French and English literature, as well as German and Italian, from the 12th to the 14th century, but none of them are at all certain. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Boccaccio\"&gt;Giovanni Boccaccio&lt;/a&gt; brought the manuscript of the \"Annals\" 11-16 and the \"Histories\" out of Monte Cassino to &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1360s or 1370s, that Tacitus began to regain some of his old literary importance. His Annals survive only in single copies of two halves of the works, one from Fulda and one from Cassino.\nItalian Renaissance.\nBoccaccio's efforts brought the works of Tacitus back into public circulation\u2014where they were largely passed over by the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;Humanists&lt;/a&gt; of the 14th and 15th centuries, who preferred the smooth style of Cicero and the patriotic history of &lt;a href=\"Livy\"&gt;Livy&lt;/a&gt;, who was by far their favorite historian. The first to read his works\u2014they were four: Boccacio, Benvenuto Rambaldi, Domenico Bandini, and &lt;a href=\"Coluccio%20Salutati\"&gt;Coluccio Salutati&lt;/a&gt;\u2014read them solely for their historical information and their literary style. On the merits of these they were divided. Bandini called him \"[a] most eloquent orator and historian\", while Salutati commented:\nFor what shall I say about Cornelius Tacitus? Although a very learned man, he wasn't able to equal those closest [to Cicero]. But he was even way behind Livy\u2014whom he proposed to follow\u2014not only in historical series but in imitation of eloquence.\nThe use of Tacitus as a source for &lt;a href=\"political%20philosophy\"&gt;political philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, however, began in this era, triggered by the &lt;a href=\"Florentine%20Republic\"&gt;Florentine Republic&lt;/a&gt;'s struggle against the imperial ambitions of &lt;a href=\"Giangaleazzo%20Visconti\"&gt;Giangaleazzo Visconti&lt;/a&gt;. Visconti's death from an illness did more than lift his siege of Florence; it sparked &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20Bruni\"&gt;Leonardo Bruni&lt;/a&gt; to write his \"Panegyric to the City of Florence\" (c. 1403), in which he quoted Tacitus (\"Histories\", &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext%3Flookup%3DTac.%2BHist.%2B1.1\"&gt;1.1&lt;/a&gt;) to buttress his &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; theory that monarchy was inimical to virtue, nobility, and (especially) genius. The inspiration was novel\u2014Bruni had probably learned of Tacitus from Salutati. The thesis likewise: Tacitus himself had acknowledged that the good emperors Nerva and Trajan posed no threat to his endeavors.\nTacitus, and the theory which Bruni based on him, played a vital role in the spirited debate between the republicans of Florence and the proponents of monarchy and aristocracy elsewhere. &lt;a href=\"Guarino%20da%20Verona\"&gt;Guarino da Verona&lt;/a&gt;, in 1435, used the literary flowering of &lt;a href=\"Caesar%20Augustus\"&gt;Augustus's&lt;/a&gt; era\u2014which included Livy, &lt;a href=\"Horace\"&gt;Horace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virgil\"&gt;Virgil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Seneca%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to argue against Bruni's contention; &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Francesco%20Poggio%20Bracciolini\"&gt;Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini&lt;/a&gt; countered with the argument that all the authors had been born during the waning years of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Candido%20Decembrio\"&gt;Pier Candido Decembrio&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;ese courtier, addressed the same argument to Bruni in the following year, which Bruni did not bother to rebut, the best counterargument having been made already. The rule of &lt;a href=\"Cosimo%20de%20Medici\"&gt;Cosimo de Medici&lt;/a&gt;, however, saw the end of these political readings of Tacitus, though his works were now readily available in the public library of Florence. Instead, scholars such as &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Battista%20Alberti\"&gt;Leone Battista Alberti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flavio%20Biondo\"&gt;Flavio Biondo&lt;/a&gt; used him in academic works on the history and architecture of 1st century Rome. His laconic style and bleak outlook remained unpopular.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, following the expulsion of the &lt;a href=\"Medici\"&gt;Medici&lt;/a&gt; from Florence, their return, and the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Italy%20during%20foreign%20domination%20and%20the%20unification\"&gt;foreign invasions of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, Tacitus returned to prominence among the theorists of &lt;a href=\"classical%20republicanism\"&gt;classical republicanism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli\"&gt;Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli&lt;/a&gt; was the first to revive him, but not (at first) in the republican model which Bruni and others had followed. One quotation from the \"Annals\" (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext%3Flookup%3DTac.%2BAnn.%2B13.19\"&gt;13.19&lt;/a&gt;) appears in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Prince\"&gt;The Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" (ch. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.constitution.org/mac/prince13.htm\"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;), advising the ruler that \"it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength\". The idealized Prince bears some resemblance to Tacitus's Tiberius; a few (most notably Giuseppe Toffanin) have argued that Machiavelli had made more use of Tacitus than he let on. In fact, though, Machiavelli had probably not read the first books of the \"Annals\" at that time\u2014they were published after \"The Prince\".\nIn his work focused mainly on republicanism, \"&lt;a href=\"Discorsi%20sopra%20la%20prima%20deca%20di%20Tito%20Livio\"&gt;Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy&lt;/a&gt;\", Machiavelli returned to Bruni's republican perspective on Tacitus. Four overt references appear in the work. Chapter &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm%231%3A10\"&gt;1.10&lt;/a&gt; follows Tacitus (\"Histories\" 1.1), and Bruni, on the chilling effects of monarchy. Chapter &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm%231%3A29\"&gt;1.29&lt;/a&gt; quotes the \"Histories\" (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext%3Flookup%3DTac.%2BHist.%2B4.3\"&gt;4.3&lt;/a&gt;) on the burden of gratitude and the pleasure of revenge. Chapter &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm%233%3A06\"&gt;3.6&lt;/a&gt; quotes Tacitus: \"men have to honor things past but obey the present, and ought to desire good Princes, but tolerate the ones they have\". &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm%233%3A19\"&gt;3.19&lt;/a&gt; twists a line from Tacitus (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext%3Flookup%3DTac.%2BAnn.%2B3.55\"&gt;3.55&lt;/a&gt;) into something very similar to Machiavelli's famous maxim that it is better for a prince to be feared than loved. (The original made a very different point: that respect for the Emperor and a desire to conform, not fear and punishment, kept certain senators in line.) Many covert references appear: Machiavelli generally follows Tacitus's decidedly negative slant on the history of Rome under the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperors&lt;/a&gt;.\nMachiavelli had read Tacitus for instruction on &lt;a href=\"form%20of%20government\"&gt;forms of government&lt;/a&gt;, republican as well as autocratic, but after his books were placed on the \"&lt;a href=\"Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum\"&gt;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&lt;/a&gt;\", writers on political philosophy (the so-called \"black Tacitists\"\u2014see above) frequently used the Roman as a stand-in for the Florentine, and the Emperor Tiberius as a mask for Machiavelli's model of a prince. So, writers like &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Guicciardini\"&gt;Francesco Guicciardini&lt;/a&gt; considered Tacitus' work to be an instruction on how to build a despotic state. Following that line of thought (Catholics in appearance reading \"Tacitus\" instead of Machiavelli's still forbidden \"Prince\"), the thinkers of the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt; and the age of absolute monarchies used his works as a set of rules and principles for political action.\nGirolamo Cardano in his 1562 book \"Encomium Neronis\" describes Tacitus as a scoundrel of the worst kind, belonging to the rich senatorial class and always taking their side against the common people.\nEnlightenment and revolutions.\nEarly theoreticians of \"&lt;a href=\"raison%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;raison d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" used Tacitus to defend an ideal of Imperial rule. Other readers used him to construct a method for living under a despotic state, avoiding both servility and useless opposition. &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Diderot\"&gt;Diderot&lt;/a&gt;, for example, used Tacitus' works, in his apology for Seneca, to justify the collaboration of philosophers with the sovereign.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; Tacitus was mostly admired for his opposition to despotism. In literature, some great tragedians such as &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Corneille\"&gt;Corneille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Racine\"&gt;Jean Racine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vittorio%20Alfieri\"&gt;Alfieri&lt;/a&gt;, took inspirations from Tacitus for their dramatic characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20Gibbon\"&gt;Edward Gibbon&lt;/a&gt; was strongly influenced by Tacitus' historical style in his \"&lt;a href=\"The%20History%20of%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;\",\nThe &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;aries, for whom Tacitus had been a central part of their early education,\nmade much use of his criticisms of tyranny and love of the &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;\u2014he is one of the authors most often quoted (behind Cicero, Horace, and Plutarch) by the members of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28French%20Revolution%29\"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20%28France%29\"&gt;Legislative Assemblies&lt;/a&gt; and by revolutionary authors such as &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Pierre%20Brissot\"&gt;Jacques Pierre Brissot&lt;/a&gt;. Later, during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Desmoulins\"&gt;Camille Desmoulins&lt;/a&gt; and the writers of the \"&lt;a href=\"Actes%20des%20ap%C3%B4tres\"&gt;Actes des ap\u00f4tres&lt;/a&gt;\" used him to denounce the excesses of the &lt;a href=\"Jacobin%20Club\"&gt;Jacobins&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, attacked his works furiously, both for style and contents. This would-be founder of an Imperial dynasty, praised by amongst others &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt; for his insight in literature, knew the danger that Tacitus's histories might pose to one who wished to go around grabbing for power. &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois de Chateaubriand&lt;/a&gt;, for one, had already compared the new Emperor of the French to the worst emperors of Rome, warning that a new Tacitus would someday do for Napoleon what Tacitus had done for Nero. The Emperor's reaction was vicious: to Goethe and &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20Martin%20Wieland\"&gt;Wieland&lt;/a&gt; he complained that \"&lt;a href=\"Tacitus\"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt; finds criminal intention in the simplest acts; he makes complete scoundrels out of all the emperors to make us admire his genius in exposing them\". To others he swore that Tacitus, \"ce &lt;a href=\"pamphleteer\"&gt;pamphl\u00e9taire&lt;/a&gt;\", had \"slandered the emperors\" whom, he averred, the Roman people had loved.\nTwentieth century.\nBy the 20th century authenticity of the remaining texts ascribed to Tacitus was generally acknowledged, apart from some difference of opinion about the \"&lt;a href=\"dialogus%20de%20oratoribus\"&gt;Dialogus&lt;/a&gt;\". Tacitus became a stock part of any education in classical literature\u00a0\u2013 usually, however, only after the study of Caesar, Livy, Cicero, etc., while Tacitus' style requires a greater understanding of the Latin language, and is perceived as less \"classical\" than the authors of the Augustan age.\nA remarkable feat was accomplished by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Graves\"&gt;Robert Graves&lt;/a&gt;: the major gap of text of the \"Annals\" that had gone lost regarded the end of &lt;a href=\"Tiberius\"&gt;Tiberius&lt;/a&gt;' reign, the whole of &lt;a href=\"Caligula\"&gt;Caligula&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, and the major part of &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt;' reign (the remaining part of Tacitus' manuscript only took up again at this Emperor's death, for the transition to the reign of &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;). Robert Graves' novels \"&lt;a href=\"I%2C%20Claudius\"&gt;I, Claudius&lt;/a&gt;\" (1934) and \"&lt;a href=\"Claudius%20the%20God\"&gt;Claudius the God&lt;/a&gt;\" (1935) filled the gap perfectly: all the missing parts of the \"Annals\", up to the latter part of the reign of Claudius himself, were covered by a coherent story. Of course part of it can be considered \"mockumentary\" in the \"&lt;a href=\"Augustan%20History\"&gt;Augustan History&lt;/a&gt;\" tradition (for example how Claudius really felt about &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republicanism&lt;/a&gt;, heavily elaborated by Graves sometimes based on \"reconstructed\" historical documents, will probably never be really established). Graves borrowed much from Tacitus' style: apart from the \"directness\" of an Emperor pictured to write down his \"memoirs\" for private use (linked to the \"lost testament of Claudius\" mentioned in Tacitus' \"Annals\"), the treatment is also on a year-by-year basis, with digressions not unlike Tacitus' \"moralising\" digressions, so that in the introduction of the second of these two volumes Graves saw fit to defend himself as follows:\nSome reviewers of \"I, Claudius\", the prefatory volume to \"Claudius the God\", suggested that in writing it I had merely consulted Tacitus's \"Annals\" and &lt;a href=\"Suetonius\"&gt;Suetonius&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Lives%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Caesars\"&gt;Twelve Caesars&lt;/a&gt;\", run them together, and expanded the result with my own \"vigorous fancy.\" This was not so; nor is it the case here. Among the Classical writers who have been borrowed from in the composition of \"Claudius the God\" are Tacitus, Cassius Dio, Suetonius, &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Pliny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Terentius%20Varro\"&gt;Varro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valerius%20Maximus\"&gt;Valerius Maximus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paulus%20Orosius\"&gt;Orosius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frontinus\"&gt;Frontinus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Caesar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Columella\"&gt;Columella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plutarch\"&gt;Plutarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Josephus\"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diodorus%20Siculus\"&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Photios%20I%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Photius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Xiphilinus\"&gt;Xiphilinus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joannes%20Zonaras\"&gt;Zonaras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seneca%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petronius\"&gt;Petronius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satires%20of%20Juvenal\"&gt;Juvenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philo\"&gt;Philo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celsus\"&gt;Celsus&lt;/a&gt;, the authors of the \"&lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles\"&gt;Acts of the Apostles&lt;/a&gt;\" and of the pseudo-gospels of &lt;a href=\"Nicodemus\"&gt;Nicodemus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20the%20Just\"&gt;St. James&lt;/a&gt;, and Claudius himself in his surviving letters and speeches.\nGraves' work reflected back on the perception of Tacitus' work: Graves curbed the \"slandering of Emperors\" by portraying Claudius as a good-humoured emperor, at heart a \"republican\", resulting in the perception that if the \"Claudius\" part of Tacitus' annals had survived it probably wouldn't have been all slander towards the emperors of the 1st century. The more explicit defence of republicanism in Graves' work (that is: \"much more\" explicit than in Tacitus' work) also made any further direct defense of \"black Tacitism\" quite impossible (as far as Napoleon, by \"not\" advocating a \"black Tacitism\" line of thought hadn't already made such interpretation obsolete).\nBy the end of 20th century, however, a sort of \"inverted red tacitism\" (as the new variant of black tacitism could be called) appeared, for example in publications like &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;Woodman's \"Tacitus reviewed\"&lt;/a&gt;: the new theories described the emperors of the &lt;a href=\"principate\"&gt;principate&lt;/a&gt; no longer as \"&lt;a href=\"monarch\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt;s\" ruling as &lt;a href=\"Autocracy\"&gt;autocrat&lt;/a&gt;s, but as \"magistrates\" in essence defending a \"republican\" form of government (which might excuse some of their rash actions), very much in line with Graves' lenient posture regarding crimes committed under the rule of \"princeps\" Claudius (for instance the putting aside of the &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Junius%20Silanus%20Torquatus\"&gt;elder L.
