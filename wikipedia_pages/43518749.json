    "text": "The 2015 Spanish local elections were held on Sunday, 24 May 2015, to elect all 67,515 councillors in the 8,122 &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;municipalities of Spain&lt;/a&gt; and all 1,040 seats in 38 &lt;a href=\"Provincial%20deputation%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;provincial deputations&lt;/a&gt;. The elections were held simultaneously with &lt;a href=\"2015%20Spanish%20regional%20elections\"&gt;regional elections&lt;/a&gt; in thirteen &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;autonomous communities&lt;/a&gt;, as well as local elections in the three &lt;a href=\"Communities%20of%20chartered%20regime\"&gt;foral deputations&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; and the eleven island councils in the &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Podemos%20%28Spanish%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Podemos&lt;/a&gt;' success in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20Spain\"&gt;European Parliament election of 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the party decided not to directly contest the local elections scheduled for May 2015, but instead to focus on the regional and general elections to be held throughout 2015. Instead, they opted for the \"&lt;a href=\"Barcelona%20en%20Com%C3%BA\"&gt;Guanyem Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;\" formula, popular unity municipal candidacies comprising different parties and social movements. The model was reproduced in many cities under the name \"Ganemos\" (Let's Win).\n&lt;a href=\"United%20Left%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;United Left&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional left-wing &lt;a href=\"Third%20party%20%28politics%29\"&gt;third party&lt;/a&gt; of Spain, also started debating on joining these local coalitions. However, this option was not well received by some party sectors, particularly their Madrid branch, who feared that the party would lose its identity if it joined these coalitions. The first attempt at a joint candidacy that included Podemos and United Left, among others, succeeded in Barcelona with \"Guanyem Barcelona\", later \"Barcelona en Com\u00fa\", under activist &lt;a href=\"Ada%20Colau\"&gt;Ada Colau&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership.\nAnother national party that decided to participate in most of these unitary candidacies was &lt;a href=\"Equo\"&gt;Equo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as minoritary parties like PUM+J, &lt;a href=\"Building%20the%20Left%E2%80%93Socialist%20Alternative\"&gt;Socialist Alternative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Alternative%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Republican Alternative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renewal%E2%80%93Nationalist%20Brotherhood\"&gt;ANOVA&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Iniciativa%20per%20Catalunya%20Verds\"&gt;Initiative for Catalonia Greens&lt;/a&gt;. The unitary lists also included individuals from social movements like the anti-eviction &lt;a href=\"Plataforma%20de%20Afectados%20por%20la%20Hipoteca\"&gt;PAH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"15-M%20Movement\"&gt;15M&lt;/a&gt;, o the so-called \"mareas\" (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"tides\") made up of workers from different service sectors like teachers, Public Health System workers or young people forced to migrate as a consequence of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9315%20Spanish%20financial%20crisis\"&gt;2008\u201315 Spanish financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nElectoral system.\n&lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Municipalities in Spain&lt;/a&gt; were local corporations with independent &lt;a href=\"legal%20person\"&gt;legal person&lt;/a&gt;ality. They had a governing body, the &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"municipal%20corporation\"&gt;corporation&lt;/a&gt;, composed of the &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.\nVoting for the local assemblies was on the basis of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the corresponding municipality and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national &lt;a href=\"Citizenship%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;European citizens&lt;/a&gt; and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"closed%20list\"&gt;closed list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with an &lt;a href=\"electoral%20threshold\"&gt;electoral threshold&lt;/a&gt; of five percent of valid votes\u2014which included blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:\nCouncillors of municipalities with populations below 250 inhabitants were elected under an &lt;a href=\"open%20list\"&gt;open list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plurality-at-large%20voting\"&gt;partial block voting&lt;/a&gt;, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties: for up to four candidates in municipalities with populations between 100 and 250 inhabitants; and for up to two candidates in municipalities below 100. This did not apply to municipalities which, as a result of their geographical location or the convenience of a better management of municipal interests or other circumstances, made it advisable to be organized through the open council system (), in which voters would directly elect the local major.\nThe mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earn the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee.\nThe electoral law allowed for &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Political%20alliance\"&gt;federations&lt;/a&gt; registered in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;coalitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grouping%20of%20electors%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;groupings of electors&lt;/a&gt; to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they sought election:\nElectors were disallowed from signing for more than one list of candidates.\n&lt;a href=\"Provincial%20deputation%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Provincial deputations&lt;/a&gt; were the governing bodies of &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;provinces in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, having an administration role of municipal activities and composed of a provincial president, an administrative body, and a plenary. &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque provinces&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Communities%20of%20chartered%20regime\"&gt;foral deputations&lt;/a&gt; instead\u2014called \"&lt;a href=\"Juntas%20Generales\"&gt;Juntas Generales&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014, whereas deputations for single-province &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;autonomous communities&lt;/a&gt; were abolished: their functions transferred to the corresponding regional parliaments. For insular provinces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;, deputations were replaced by island councils in each of the islands or group of islands. For &lt;a href=\"Majorca\"&gt;Majorca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menorca\"&gt;Menorca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibiza\"&gt;Ibiza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Formentera\"&gt;Formentera&lt;/a&gt; this figure was referred to in Spanish as \"consejo insular\" (), whereas for &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Canaria\"&gt;Gran Canaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenerife\"&gt;Tenerife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fuerteventura\"&gt;Fuerteventura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"La%20Gomera\"&gt;La Gomera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El%20Hierro\"&gt;El Hierro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanzarote\"&gt;Lanzarote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20Palma\"&gt;La Palma&lt;/a&gt; its name was \"&lt;a href=\"cabildo%20insular\"&gt;cabildo insular&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMost deputations were indirectly elected by local councillors from municipalities in each &lt;a href=\"Judicial%20districts%20of%20Spain\"&gt;judicial district&lt;/a&gt;. Seats were allocated to provincial deputations based on the following scale:\nIsland councils and foral deputations were &lt;a href=\"Direct%20election\"&gt;elected directly&lt;/a&gt; by electors under their own, specific electoral regulations.\nMunicipal elections.\nCity control.\nThe following table lists party control in provincial capitals, as well as in municipalities above or around 75,000.
