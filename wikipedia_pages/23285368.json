    "text": "Eva Gustavson (18 February 1917 \u2013 10 February 2009), sometimes known as Eva Gustafson, was a &lt;a href=\"Norwegian-American\"&gt;Norwegian-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"contralto\"&gt;contralto&lt;/a&gt; who had an active international performance career in &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;s and concerts during the 1940s and 1950s. She later embarked on a second career as a voice teacher in the United States, notably teaching for many years on the music faculty of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEva Gustavson was born in &lt;a href=\"Horten\"&gt;Horten&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Fjord\"&gt;Oslo Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Her father, Oscar Gustavson, was a violinist-conductor at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%2C%20Oslo\"&gt;National Theatre&lt;/a&gt; and later at &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;; her mother, Margit Gustavson (n\u00e9e Schwartz), played the piano and was an organist. Eva studied singing and dancing in her youth, becoming an accomplished tap-dancer, acrobat, and musician. She joined a traveling cabaret troupe in her late teens but was later advised to quit in order to pursue a career as an opera singer. She studied singing in Oslo with &lt;a href=\"Bokken%20Lasson\"&gt;Bokken Lasson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soffi%20Sch%C3%B8nning\"&gt;Soffi Sch\u00f8nning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Signe%20Amundsen\"&gt;Signe Amundsen&lt;/a&gt;. During the early part of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she entered the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20Opera\"&gt;Stockholm Opera&lt;/a&gt; School in neutral &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; on a scholarship where she studied under &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20von%20Skilondz\"&gt;Adelaide von Skilondz&lt;/a&gt;. She was also mentored during this time by &lt;a href=\"Kirsten%20Flagstad\"&gt;Kirsten Flagstad&lt;/a&gt;. She became separated from her family for the duration of much of the war, as they were stranded by the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Norway%20by%20Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;. After the War, Gustavson continued with further studies in &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; under the advice of Flagstad. She later studied the title role of \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\" in California with &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Rosing\"&gt;Vladimir Rosing&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nGustavson made her professional opera debut in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; in 1946. In 1947 she won first prize at the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; international music competition in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. In 1947-1948 she was a principal contralto at the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20Royal%20de%20Wallonie\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra Royal de Wallonie&lt;/a&gt; and made several appearances at &lt;a href=\"La%20Monnaie\"&gt;La Monnaie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brussels%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Brussels, Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. She spent the next 15 years performing lead roles in major &lt;a href=\"opera%20house\"&gt;opera house&lt;/a&gt;s throughout Europe and North America. She became particularly associated with the title role in &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bizet\"&gt;Georges Bizet&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\", a role she portrayed more than 300 times during her career in multiple languages. Her first portrayal of Carmen was in 1949 at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Opera\"&gt;Royal Swedish Opera&lt;/a&gt;. Her other signature roles were Amneris in &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Aida\"&gt;Aida&lt;/a&gt;\" and Azucena in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20trovatore\"&gt;Il trovatore&lt;/a&gt;\". Although she appeared in operas and toured throughout Europe and North America, Gustavson spent much of her career performing with the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Norwegian National Opera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;.\nImmigration.\nIn 1949 Gustavson immigrated to the United States. That same year she gave what is probably her best known performance, the role of Amneris in &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Toscanini\"&gt;Arturo Toscanini&lt;/a&gt;'s 1949 concert telecast and recording of &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"A%C3%AFda\"&gt;A\u00efda&lt;/a&gt;\" with the &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;NBC Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Herva%20Nelli\"&gt;Herva Nelli&lt;/a&gt; in the title role. &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Tucker%20%28tenor%29\"&gt;Richard Tucker&lt;/a&gt; was Radames. In the mid-1950s she settled on the West Coast of the United States, raised a family, and continued to appear in concert, including a performance of &lt;a href=\"Stravinsky\"&gt;Stravinsky&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Rossignol\"&gt;Le Rossignol&lt;/a&gt;\" under the baton of the composer. Gustavson also taught on the voice faculty of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; for seventeen years. In 1977 she was honored by the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Norway\"&gt;King of Norway&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Order%20of%20St.%20Olav\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav&lt;/a&gt;. She published an autobiography entitled \"Shooting Star From Dovrehallen to Toscanini, and then San Pedro\". Gustavson died in &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;San Pedro, Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, one week before her 92nd birthday."
