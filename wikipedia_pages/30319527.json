He was responsible for 12 touchdowns in his freshman year, scoring them all in five different ways, the first player in the program to do so (seven touchdown receptions, two rushing touchdowns, one passing touchdown, one punt return, and one kickoff return). He also set the FIU single season record for total receiving yards (41 receptions for 1,013 yards), average yards per reception (24.7 yards per reception), and all-purpose yardage (2,162). He finished his freshman season ranked third in the nation in all-purpose yardage per game, with an average of 180.25 yards per contest and was consequently named &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Belt%20Conference\"&gt;Sun Belt&lt;/a&gt; Freshman Player of the Year.\n2009 season.\nForeshadowing the start of FIU's 2009 campaign against &lt;a href=\"2009%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, Crimson Tide head coach &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Saban\"&gt;Nick Saban&lt;/a&gt; referred to Hilton as \"a better offensive player than anybody [from &lt;a href=\"2009%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team\"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;] that we played against last week\".

After a mid-season loss to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Florida%20Atlantic%20Owls%20football%20team\"&gt;FAU Owls&lt;/a&gt;, Hilton came back strong the next game against the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Louisiana%E2%80%93Monroe%20Warhawks%20football%20team\"&gt;Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks&lt;/a&gt;, scoring four separate touchdowns, the first coming on a 95-yard kick return while the others were two passes from quarterback &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20Carroll%20%28quarterback%29\"&gt;Wesley Carroll&lt;/a&gt; and the last a rushing touchdown.
