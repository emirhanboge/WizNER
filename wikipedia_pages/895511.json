The club currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20First%20League\"&gt;Czech First League&lt;/a&gt;, the first tier of Czech football.

Being relegated to &lt;a href=\"Czech%20National%20Football%20League\"&gt;Czech National Football League&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, the club won the league the subsequent season and got a promotion back to First League in 2015, but failed to stay in the top division and were relegated after only one season.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded as FK Hej\u010d\u00edn Olomouc in 1919, playing in the national top league for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;1982\u201383 season&lt;/a&gt; as Sigma ZTS Olomouc. The club next played in the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20First%20League\"&gt;Czechoslovak First League&lt;/a&gt; in the 1984\u201385 season, remaining in the top level of football for the rest of the Czechoslovak era.

The club was fined 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20franc\"&gt;Swiss franc&lt;/a&gt;s in October 1999 for racist chanting in a UEFA Cup match against &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Mallorca\"&gt;Real Mallorca&lt;/a&gt;'s black players.\nIn August 2011, the club was fined 4 million &lt;a href=\"Czech%20koruna\"&gt;Czech koruna&lt;/a&gt; and deducted nine points as a result of a corruption enquiry by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Football Association of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.
