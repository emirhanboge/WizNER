    "text": "Lieut-Colonel Kenneth Mason &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; (10 September 1887 \u2013 2 June 1976) was a British soldier and geographer notable as the first statutory &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;. His work &lt;a href=\"surveying\"&gt;surveying&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; was rewarded in 1927 with a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Medal%20%28RGS%29\"&gt;Founder's Medal&lt;/a&gt;, the citation reading \"for his connection between the surveys of India and Russian Turkestan, and his leadership of the Shaksgam Expedition\".\nPersonal life.\nKenneth Mason was born at &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Sutton\"&gt;Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Elizabeth Martin (n\u00e9e Turner) and Stanley Engledue Mason, a timber broker. He was educated first at &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20College\"&gt;Cheltenham College&lt;/a&gt; and then the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich\"&gt;Royal Military Academy, Woolwich&lt;/a&gt;.\nMason married Dorothy Helen Robinson in 1917 and they had two sons and one daughter.\nDevoted to the &lt;a href=\"Drapers%27%20Company\"&gt;Drapers' Company&lt;/a&gt;, Mason became its Master in 1949.\nMilitary service.\nMason was &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Engineers\"&gt;Royal Engineers&lt;/a&gt;. There, he helped to pioneer &lt;a href=\"Stereoscopy\"&gt;stereoscopic&lt;/a&gt; techniques that were to revolutionise &lt;a href=\"cartography\"&gt;cartography&lt;/a&gt; using aerial and land-based &lt;a href=\"photogrammetry\"&gt;photogrammetry&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1914, Mason's &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; service took him to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Neuve%20Chapelle\"&gt;Neuve Chapelle&lt;/a&gt; sector and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Loos\"&gt;Loos&lt;/a&gt;) before, in January 1916, he landed at &lt;a href=\"Basra\"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. In action connected to the relief of &lt;a href=\"Kut\"&gt;Kut&lt;/a&gt;, he led a night march to the flank of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dujaila\"&gt;Dujailah redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently awarded the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt;. He entered &lt;a href=\"Baghdad\"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; as Intelligence Officer with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Watch\"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt;. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Brevet%20%28military%29\"&gt;Brevet-Major&lt;/a&gt; and three times mentioned in dispatches. Following the &lt;a href=\"Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt; he was the first to take cars across the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Desert\"&gt;Syrian Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nExplorer.\nIn 1909, Mason sailed for &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; and was posted to the &lt;a href=\"Survey%20of%20India\"&gt;Survey of India&lt;/a&gt;. 1910-1912 saw him engaged on &lt;a href=\"Triangulation%20%28surveying%29\"&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;, where he learned climbing techniques, taught himself to ski and went on to make a &lt;a href=\"Photogrammetry\"&gt;stereographic&lt;/a&gt; land survey.\nMason returned to India after the First World War and began preparing for his most important scientific project, the exploration of the &lt;a href=\"Shaksgam%20Valley\"&gt;Shaksgam Valley&lt;/a&gt;, in 1926. At that time the only westerner to see the valley had been &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Younghusband\"&gt;Francis Younghusband&lt;/a&gt;, whose book \"The heart of a continent : a narrative of travels in Manchuria, across the Gobi Desert, through the Himalayas, the Pamirs, and Chitral, 1884-1894\" had first inspired Mason as a schoolboy to pursue a career in &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Younghusband encouraged Mason to follow in his footsteps.\nThrough the 1920s, the interest of the British authorities had grown in the unmapped and uninhabited territories of the Shaksgam Valley because it provided access to the Aghil Pass linking China to &lt;a href=\"Ladakh\"&gt;Ladakh&lt;/a&gt;, India. With support from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society&lt;/a&gt; (RGS), Mason began a survey using a &lt;a href=\"theodolite\"&gt;photo-theodolite&lt;/a&gt;, laboriously collecting great quantities of data that represented the first attempt to apply stereographic techniques to both small scales and great distances. His results, plotted in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; using what, at the time, was the world's most advanced &lt;a href=\"Stereoplotter\"&gt;Stereoplotter&lt;/a&gt; were acclaimed as brilliantly successful and won him the award of the 1927 RGS &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Medal%20%28RGS%29\"&gt;Founder's Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt;. While Mason had failed to fully descend the Shaksgam Valley he had been able to explore the Aghil range in the &lt;a href=\"Karakoram%20fault%20system\"&gt;Karakoram fault system&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the valley of the Zug Shaksgam.\nIn 1928, Mason and &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Corbett\"&gt;Geoffrey Corbett&lt;/a&gt; convened a group to co-found &lt;a href=\"The%20Himalayan%20Club\"&gt;The Himalayan Club&lt;/a&gt;, \"To encourage and assist Himalayan travel and exploration, and to extend knowledge of the Himalaya and adjoining mountain ranges through science, art, literature and sport.\" Mason edited the club's &lt;a href=\"Himalayan%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; until 1940.\nMason's experiences of this period of his life in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; were included in an oral history compiled by historian &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Allen%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Charles Allen&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, his long association with the RGS, including serving on its council and as a vice-president, was to prove pivotal to the next step in his career.\nAcademic Geographer.\nThe archives of Oxford University contain evidence that &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt; was taught in several colleges since at least 1541. However, the subject was given low priority until, in 1871, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society&lt;/a&gt; (RGS) made an approach that resulted in a Readership being established in 1887. Twelve years later, in 1899, a School of Geography was founded and a diploma course was introduced, with continuing financial support from the RGS, yet still the subject was not deemed of sufficient academic merit to warrant study for its own sake. It was not until 1932 that an Honours program was introduced and a statutory Chair of Geography was established associated with a Fellowship at &lt;a href=\"Hertford%20College\"&gt;Hertford College&lt;/a&gt;. With support form the RGS, Mason was elected to the new chair, becoming the first statutory professor at the University of Oxford from 1 May 1932. His first task was to establish regulations for the new school which were published in 1932. The first Honour examinations were held the following year and by 1937 student numbers had reached 30 undergraduates.\nMason's academic work, linked to the Himalayan Journal which he had founded in 1929, addressed the challenge of naming ranges in the &lt;a href=\"Karakoram\"&gt;Karakoram&lt;/a&gt; region (specifically, the &lt;a href=\"Baltoro%20Muztagh\"&gt;Baltoro Muztagh&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 1940 Mason was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Fleming\"&gt;Ian Fleming&lt;/a&gt; (who later wrote the famous James Bond stories) and Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Godfrey\"&gt;John Henry Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; about the preparation of reports on the geography of countries involved in military operations. These reports were the precursors of the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Intelligence%20Handbooks\"&gt;\"Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series\"&lt;/a&gt; produced between 1941 and 1946. Mason directed a team of academics at Oxford who contributed around half of what was, at the time, one of the largest geographic projects ever attempted.\nKenneth Mason retired from his chair at Oxford in 1953 but continued to write and give lectures on topics relating to the exploration of the Himalaya into his retirement. His final major work, \"Abode of Snow: A History of Himalayan Exploration And Mountaineering\", was written shortly after the triumph of the &lt;a href=\"1953%20British%20Mount%20Everest%20expedition\"&gt;1953 British Mount Everest expedition&lt;/a&gt; and presents a comprehensive history of Himalayan exploration up to the first confirmed ascent of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Everest\"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edmund%20Hillary\"&gt;Sir Edmund Hillary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tenzing%20Norgay\"&gt;Tenzing Norgay&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks.\nMason also contributed obituaries for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography for two fellow explorers:"
