Announced in 2010, the platform was demonstrated running &lt;a href=\"Moblin%20Linux\"&gt;Moblin Linux&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Moorestown platform introduced the Simple Firmware Interface (SFI), a lightweight alternative to ACPI. In Linux 5.12, support for SFI, which was previously marked as obsolete, was removed from the kernel by Intel."
