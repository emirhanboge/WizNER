    "text": "Eden Park is &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s largest sports stadium. Located in central &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand's largest city, it is three kilometres southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20CBD\"&gt;CBD&lt;/a&gt;, on the boundary between the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Eden\"&gt;Mount Eden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingsland%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Kingsland&lt;/a&gt;. Although used primarily for &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; in winter and &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; in summer, it has hosted &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; and association &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches. In 2011 it hosted pool games, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final of &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so it became the first stadium in the world to host two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;Rugby World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;s, having held the inaugural final &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;in 1987&lt;/a&gt;. It was a venue for the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.\nEden Park is considered one of rugby union's most difficult assignments for visiting sides. New Zealand's national rugby union team, the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;, have been unbeaten at this venue in 46 consecutive test matches stretching back to 1994. Eden Park is the site of the 2021 &lt;a href=\"Te%20Matatini\"&gt;Te Matatini&lt;/a&gt;. It will also be the site for the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Women%27s%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2021 Women's Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the final of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2021 Women's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the opening match of the &lt;a href=\"2023%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2023 FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins of Eden Park.\nThe land where Eden Park stands was originally swampland, fed by lava caverns created by &lt;a href=\"Maungawhau%20/%20Mount%20Eden\"&gt;Maungawhau / Mount Eden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Albert%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Mount Albert&lt;/a&gt; over 30,000 years ago. &lt;a href=\"T%C4%81maki%20M%C4%81ori\"&gt;T\u0101maki M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; used the swamp to collect food and materials. In 1845, the area was purchased by Cornish farmer John Walters. Eden Park has been a sports ground since 1900. The park began as a cricket ground in 1903, and was due to the vision of one Harry Ryan, a cricket enthusiast who approached landowner John Walters to lease part of his land as a sports field. In the book \"Eden Park: A History\", the authors write, \"Certainly the rough paddock strewn with stones, studded with outcrops of rock and streaked with cowpats, falling away to a boggy trough that filled in a downpour and remained flooded throughout the winter, looked better suited to frog-hunting or duck-shooting than cricket, let alone rugby. Ryan knew or at least imagined better.\" Much early work on the cricket ground was needed, including clearing the stone walls that had been used to divide farmland, and ongoing drainage issues.\nThose who saw Ryan's vision as madness most likely felt vindicated when, in 1907, massive downpours of rain saw the ground submerged in water for a week. The same thing happened again later in the year. By 1910, the ongoing maintenance costs led the Eden District Cricket Club to approach the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Cricket%20Association\"&gt;Auckland Cricket Association&lt;/a&gt; to take over running the park. By 1912, the land had been transferred from John Walters to the trustees of the cricket association, backed financially by a number of well-known Auckland businessman. The name 'Eden Park' settled into general usage around 1912, soon after it had been taken over by the association.\nOpening as a cricket and rugby venue.\nIn 1913 the park was leased to the Auckland Rugby Football Union, becoming both a summer and winter sporting venue, with the union leasing the venue initially for 21 years. The union agreed to pay to build the park's first grandstand, erected in 1913 to hold an audience of 2,500, and later followed by a second members' stand built in 1914. In 1914, the first international cricket match was held, with Auckland hosting &lt;a href=\"Australia%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The first rugby match played at the venue was a seven-a-side series on 9 May 1914, and the first representative match was played on 5 September, against Wellington. Drainage issues ceased to be a regular issue for Kingsland and Eden Park in the 1920s, after which the park began to flourish. The first rugby test was held on 27 August 1921, when &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; beat New Zealand &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20union%20matches%20between%20New%20Zealand%20and%20South%20Africa\"&gt;5\u20139&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 40,000. The &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Auckland Rugby Football Union&lt;/a&gt; officially made Eden Park its home in 1925, and in 1926, a trust was set up to manage Eden Park primarily for the benefit of Auckland Cricket and Auckland Rugby.\nIn 1930, the ground hosted its inaugural &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt; matches as part of the &lt;a href=\"1930%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia\"&gt;1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Matches were held against Auckland and New Zealand sides, both won by the home sides with an attendance of 45,000 at the latter. The ground hosted its first match between New Zealand and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"1931%20Australia%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1931 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. New Zealand won &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20union%20matches%20between%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;20 \u2013 13&lt;/a&gt;. In 1933, New Zealand hosted &lt;a href=\"England%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in the first cricket test match, where &lt;a href=\"Wally%20Hammond\"&gt;Wally Hammond&lt;/a&gt; set an individual test batting record of 336 not out.\nEden Park served as the opening ceremony and athletics venue for the &lt;a href=\"1950%20British%20Empire%20Games\"&gt;1950 British Empire Games&lt;/a&gt;, when the western part of the grounds were first opened. In 1955, New Zealand hosted England in the second test match of their &lt;a href=\"English%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201954%E2%80%9355\"&gt;1954\u201355 Tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. During the same year, the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Parliament\"&gt;New Zealand Parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed the Eden Park Trust Act, enshrining the governance structure of the park until 2009. By 1956, the West Stand was completed, followed by the South Stand in 1958. New Zealand won its first cricket test match against the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20cricket%20team\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201955%E2%80%9356\"&gt;1955\u201356 West Indies Tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The ground hosted its third rugby international between New Zealand and South Africa. New Zealand won &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20union%20matches%20between%20New%20Zealand%20and%20South%20Africa\"&gt;11 \u2013 5&lt;/a&gt; before a record crowd of 63,000. The British and Irish Lions returned for the third time in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; with matches against Auckland and New Zealand. The visitors win both, their first test match win at the ground.\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, further large scale events were held at the venue, including &lt;a href=\"1961%20France%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia\"&gt;1961 French tour of New Zealand and Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1963%20England%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australasia\"&gt;1963 England tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1969%20Wales%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Oceania\"&gt;1969 Wales rugby union tour of Oceania&lt;/a&gt;, a welcoming party for the royal family during the &lt;a href=\"1970%20New%20Zealand%20Royal%20Visit%20Honours\"&gt;1970 New Zealand Royal Visit Honours&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201973%E2%80%9374\"&gt;Australian tour of New Zealand (1973\u201374)&lt;/a&gt;, and a gymnastic display held by touring &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gymnasts\"&gt;gymnasts&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Korbut\"&gt;Olga Korbut&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"1975%20Scotland%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1975 Scotland rugby union tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, both teams famously played during a downpour on a completely saturated pitch, before the one-off test had to be cancelled as the drainage system was unable to cope with the flooding.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Springbok%20Tour\"&gt;1981 Springbok Tour&lt;/a&gt;, a low-flying &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20172\"&gt;Cessna 172&lt;/a&gt; piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole disrupted the final &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%23Major%20international%20competitions\"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; by dropping flour-bombs on the pitch.\nThe 1980s saw a number of record events such as a crowd of 43,000 at the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201981%E2%80%9382\"&gt;1981\u201382 Australia Tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, where Australian batsman &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Chappell\"&gt;Greg Chappell&lt;/a&gt; dealing with an on ground streaker with his bat. An indoor cricket facility and stand were built next to the outer oval. At the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;inaugural Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 1987, New Zealand defeated &lt;a href=\"France%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20union%20matches%20between%20France%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;29 \u2013 9&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; in front of a crowd of 48,035. In 1988, Eden Park hosted the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1988 Rugby League World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; defeating &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; 25 \u2013 12 before a New Zealand rugby league record crowd of 47,363. This was the first game of rugby league played at Eden Park since 1919. Eden Park was a venue during the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1992 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, cohosted with Australia.\nIn 1996, the new &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Blues\"&gt;Auckland Blues&lt;/a&gt; began playing at the ground, with the inaugural &lt;a href=\"1996%20Super%2012%20season\"&gt;Super 12 final&lt;/a&gt; held at the ground, with the Auckland Blues defeating the 45 \u2013 21 before a crowd of 46,000. The ground hosted Super 12 finals in 1997, 1998 and 2003. The ground hosted its first rugby test between New Zealand and &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Ireland%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;2002 Ireland Tour of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003, the playing surface on the main oval was completely overhauled with the introduction of \"Motz\" turf.\n2011 Rugby World Cup and redevelopment.\nIn 2007, the ground was confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Government\"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt; as the venue for the final of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, with redevelopment beginning in 2008. The ground was the subject of a hotly debated dilemma, as to whether the event should be hosted at historic Eden Park or a new city centre stadium. The redeveloped stadium was officially opened by &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister\"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Key\"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt; on 10 October. The first event was a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20Four%20Nations\"&gt;Rugby League Four Nations&lt;/a&gt; double header, including matches between &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, and Australia and New Zealand.\nThe 2011 Rugby World Cup commenced on 9 September, with New Zealand defeating &lt;a href=\"Tonga%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Pool%20A\"&gt;41 \u2013 10&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 60,214. In addition to the opening ceremony and match, five pool games, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final are held at Eden Park, with a cumulative attendance of more than 600,000. New Zealand defeated France &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;8 \u2013 7&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 61,079.\nThe ground hosted its first game of professional football, with the &lt;a href=\"Wellington%20Phoenix\"&gt;Wellington Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; hosting &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20United\"&gt;Adelaide United&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 20,078.\nIn 2013 the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Warriors\"&gt;New Zealand Warriors&lt;/a&gt; announced they would be playing three home games at Eden Park in the 2014 &lt;a href=\"NRL\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; season.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Council\"&gt;Auckland Council&lt;/a&gt; takes over five of the nine spots on the Eden Park Trust Board, giving ratepayers control over the ground.\nIn 2015, it hosted four matches during the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which was co-hosted by &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; including the first semi final between &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium hosted its first day night test match during the &lt;a href=\"English%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%202017%E2%80%9318\"&gt;English cricket tour in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2020, after 117 years, Eden Park sold week-long naming rights to longtime partner, ASB. As part of their commitment to small business in New Zealand, ASB gifted their naming rights to Coopers Catch\u2014a small fish and chip shop from Kaik\u014dura.\nIn 2021, for the first time since 1975, Eden Park hosted a concert, headlined by the band &lt;a href=\"Six60\"&gt;Six60&lt;/a&gt; to a sold-out crowd of about 50,000 atendees. The concert was also one of the biggest concerts in the world at the time, due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedevelopment.\nCapacity.\nThe $256 million redevelopment completed in October 2010 provided a permanent capacity of 50,000 with a further 10,000 temporary seats for the 2011 Rugby World Cup games. This is the largest of any New Zealand sports arena. There are no standing areas. Temporary seating in front of the North Stand and the West Stand (usually only used for international rugby matches) is required for the capacity to be reached. Due to sight-screens and the larger area required for cricket matches, cricket capacity is smaller.\nPrior to redevelopment, Eden Park had a crowd capacity of 47,500 for rugby and 42,000 for cricket .\nExpansion.\nThe redevelopment project included a three-tier South stand replacing the old South and West stands, with a capacity of 24,000, and a three-tier East replacing the Terraces. The number of covered seats increased from 23,000 to 38,000. The redeveloped Eden Park has an internal concourse that allows people to circulate around the grounds inside the stadium, and world-class facilities, including food and beverage outlets, toilets and corporate areas, were incorporated. The open plan approach to the design and establishment of a community centre and green space, and the removal of the &lt;a href=\"perimeter%20fence\"&gt;perimeter fence&lt;/a&gt;, mean that the stadium has become more publicly accessible and a part of the neighbourhood.\nThere were public concerns about the height of the new structure and its shading effect on many nearby houses. Auckland City Council received 470 submissions on the &lt;a href=\"resource%20consent\"&gt;resource consent&lt;/a&gt; application, over 300 of which were in favour of the redevelopment. On 26 January 2007, Eden Park received resource consent with 91 conditions imposed. The consent permitted the building of new stands in place of the terraces and south stand, but did not include consent for the NZ$385 million 'full option', which would have included covered seating.\nPossible alternative stadium for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nIn September 2006 it was announced that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;new stadium&lt;/a&gt; on Auckland's waterfront to host the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This assessment was part of the Government's formal due diligence process on the decision to redevelop Eden Park. The Government had said it would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Labour%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt; announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would not have gone ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Regional%20Council\"&gt;Auckland Regional Council&lt;/a&gt; differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues.\nRugby union.\nEden Park is the home ground for the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Blues\"&gt;Auckland Blues&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mitre%2010%20Cup\"&gt;Mitre 10 Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The ground regularly hosts &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; rugby union test matches. &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; first used the ground in the 1913 season, and the first international fixture was against South Africa in 1921. The &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20Blues\"&gt;Auckland Blues&lt;/a&gt; have used the ground since their foundation in 1996.\nThe final game of the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Springbok%20Tour\"&gt;1981 Springbok Tour&lt;/a&gt; was played at Eden Park. A low-flying Cessna 172 piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole dropped flour bombs on the field as part of widespread protests against the tour and apartheid.\nEden Park was used in the inaugural &lt;a href=\"1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1987 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, both of which the All Blacks won against France, making it the first ground to host two Rugby World Cup finals.\nIn late 2015, the ground also hosted a public memorial for legendary All Black wing &lt;a href=\"Jonah%20Lomu\"&gt;Jonah Lomu&lt;/a&gt; after he died at the age of 40.\nIt will be the site for the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2021 Women's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; including the final.\nNew Zealand's overall Test match record at Eden Park against all nations, updated to 14 August 2021, is as follows:\nCricket.\nEden Park is the home ground for the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Auckland cricket team&lt;/a&gt;. The ground regularly hosts international fixtures, including &lt;a href=\"Test%20Cricket\"&gt;Tests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One%20Day%20International\"&gt;ODIs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twenty20%20International\"&gt;Twenty20 International&lt;/a&gt;s, while the Outer Oval also hosts &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20One%20Day%20International%20cricket\"&gt;WODIs&lt;/a&gt;, domestic List A and Twenty20 games.\nIt first hosted a test in 1930. The ground was also the host to &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s first Test victory, against &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20cricket%20team\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; in 1955\u201356 season. It has also been the scene of a dark day in New Zealand's cricket history when on 28 March 1955, the hosts collapsed to their lowest Test score (26 all out) against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ground hosted four matches during the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1992 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; including the semi-final between New Zealand and &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, which Pakistan won by four wickets en route to winning the tournament after &lt;a href=\"Inzamam-ul-Haq\"&gt;Inzamam-ul-Haq&lt;/a&gt;'s 60 off 37 in reply to Black Caps captain Martin Crowe's 91. It also hosted four matches during the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which was co-hosted by &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The matches played included two pool B games and the pool A clash between co-hosts &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, which New Zealand won by one wicket via &lt;a href=\"Kane%20Williamson\"&gt;Kane Williamson&lt;/a&gt;'s six off &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Cummins\"&gt;Pat Cummins&lt;/a&gt; with 6 required after &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20Starc\"&gt;Mitchell Starc&lt;/a&gt; had taken 6 wickets in reply to &lt;a href=\"Trent%20Boult\"&gt;Trent Boult&lt;/a&gt;'s 5.

Ahead of the second ODI of the New Zealand-India series at the ground in March 1994, regular opener &lt;a href=\"Navjot%20Singh%20Sidhu\"&gt;Navjot Singh Sidhu&lt;/a&gt; was ruled out with a stiff neck, opening the way for the 21-year-old Tendulkar's promotion.

This also sees Eden Park (as of 2018) as the only venue to host the World Cup Final for both rugby codes. In a spiteful match in which the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand national rugby league team&lt;/a&gt; seemed more intent on dishing out punishment than playing football, the &lt;a href=\"Wally%20Lewis\"&gt;Wally Lewis&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Kangaroos\"&gt;Australians&lt;/a&gt; defeated the home side 25\u201312 after leading 25\u20130 early in the second half. The game was played in front of a record New Zealand rugby league attendance of 47,363 (only 672 less than attended the 1987 Rugby WCF between the All Blacks and France 16 months earlier). Australia had won the right to host the final, but as international crowds in Australia had been dwindling in recent years due to the Kangaroos dominance (only 15,944 had attended the &lt;a href=\"dead%20rubber\"&gt;dead rubber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Ashes series&lt;/a&gt; test between Australia and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20Lions\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Football%20Stadium\"&gt;Sydney Football Stadium&lt;/a&gt; three months earlier), the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Australian Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; agreed to &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; hosting the game in the interests of promoting international rugby league. Their efforts were rewarded with the largest World Cup Final attendance since &lt;a href=\"1968%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, when 54,290 saw Australia defeat &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Sydney Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nEden Park hosted two matches (a double header) in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Rugby%20League%20Four%20Nations\"&gt;2010 Rugby League Four Nations&lt;/a&gt; on 6 November.
