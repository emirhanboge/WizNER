    "text": "La Guardia is a &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pop-rock\"&gt;pop-rock&lt;/a&gt; band. They were especially famous in the late 1980s and early 1990s, although they are still active today (after a hiatus). They have sold more than 2 million records.\nHistory.\nThe group was founded in &lt;a href=\"Granada\"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1983%20in%20music\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; by Manuel Espa\u00f1a (voice), Enrique Moreno \"Conejo\" (bass guitar) and Carlos Gilabert (keyboard), with the initial name of \"La guardia del Cardenal Richelieu\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Richelieu\"&gt;Cardinal Richelieu&lt;/a&gt;'s Guard\"). They were only teenagers and they adopted this name because they used to rehearse in the afternoons after they watched \"&lt;a href=\"Dogtanian%20and%20the%20Three%20Muskehounds\"&gt;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds&lt;/a&gt;\" on TV.\nUnder this name they released a first single with techno and mod sounds. After this, Gilabert left the band, and Joaqu\u00edn Almendros (guitar) and Emilio Mu\u00f1oz (drums) joined it, giving birth to the band's most famous line-up. They moved to &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Movida\"&gt;Movida&lt;/a&gt; was still ebullient, looking for broader success, and in &lt;a href=\"1985%20in%20music\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, they recorded an EP, now as La Guardia, after winning the Villablanca pop-rock festival in the town of &lt;a href=\"Fuengirola\"&gt;Fuengirola&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1986 they travelled to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to record their first full album \"Noches como esta\"; but it's in 1988, with the album \"V\u00e1monos\", when they achieved major success, thanks mostly to the hugely successful single \"Mil calles llevan hacia ti\", which reached #1 in the Spanish &lt;a href=\"Los%2040%20principales\"&gt;40 Principales&lt;/a&gt; chart in 1989, and which became the band's signature song. Manuel Espa\u00f1a said he had written the song while walking through the streets of the &lt;a href=\"Albayz%C3%ADn\"&gt;Albayz\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; in Granada to his grandmother's house. \"V\u00e1monos\" went on to become a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20music%20recording%20sales%20certifications\"&gt;multi-platinum album&lt;/a&gt;, selling over 250.000 copies, and the band performed on a tour with more than 100 dates.\nIn 1990 came their second album, \"Cuando Brille El Sol\", with its same-titled and successful single, which kept them at the top of the Spanish pop-rock scene.\n\"Al Otro Lado\" (1991), \"Contra reloj\" (1993) and \"Acento del sur\" (1994) were their next works, all three produced by &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Wakeman\"&gt;Dusty Wakeman&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was recorded in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; at Mad Dog Studios. Shortly after this experience, Enrique Moreno died from a coronary disease, and this tragic event ultimately caused the group to disband in 1997.\nLater, after he had been working for a few years on another band called Chamaco, Espa\u00f1a tried to revive La Guardia without the involvement of Almendros, which caused the latter to present two lawsuits. Finally, Espa\u00f1a won the rights to use the name for his new project and in 2003 he released \"Ahora!\", an acoustic record produced by Carlos Go\u00f1i, from the band Rev\u00f3lver.\nIn 2007, with a new record company (&lt;a href=\"Vale%20Music\"&gt;Vale Music&lt;/a&gt;), La Guardia recorded \"Sobre ruedas\", an album of &lt;a href=\"country%20rock\"&gt;country rock&lt;/a&gt; sounds, which sold just over 20.000 copies.\nIn 2008 the band celebrated their 25th anniversary with the album \"25 a\u00f1os no es nada\", in which Manuel Espa\u00f1a performed the band's hits with the collaboration of other artists such as La Mari (of &lt;a href=\"Chambao\"&gt;Chambao&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Urquijo\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Urquijo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mikel%20Erentxun\"&gt;Mikel Erentxun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ariel%20Rot\"&gt;Ariel Rot&lt;/a&gt; or Raimundo Amador."
