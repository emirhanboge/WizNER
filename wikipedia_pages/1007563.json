    "text": "Commandments is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama which was written and directed by Daniel Taplitz and stars &lt;a href=\"Aidan%20Quinn\"&gt;Aidan Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Courteney%20Cox\"&gt;Courteney Cox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20LaPaglia\"&gt;Anthony LaPaglia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"executive%20producer\"&gt;executive producer&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Reitman\"&gt;Ivan Reitman&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot Synopsis.\nEver since Seth Warner's (&lt;a href=\"Aidan%20Quinn\"&gt;Aidan Quinn&lt;/a&gt;) wife died two years ago, his life has gone to pieces. In his rage, he affronts God who seemingly responds by stopping his suicide attempt and his screaming at God above by crippling his dog and putting Seth in the hospital. So Seth sets out to break all of the &lt;a href=\"ten%20commandments\"&gt;ten commandments&lt;/a&gt;. Moving in with his sister-in-law, Rachel (&lt;a href=\"Courteney%20Cox\"&gt;Courteney Cox&lt;/a&gt;), and her reporter-husband, Harry (&lt;a href=\"Anthony%20LaPaglia\"&gt;Anthony LaPaglia&lt;/a&gt;), he systematically starts breaking each of the commandments, increasingly aided by Harry and Rachel. When Rachel finds out Harry has been having an affair, she responds by having an affair with Seth. Seth then steals all of Harry's personally autographed guitars and pawns them. Harry loses his job and finds out Rachel is pregnant with Seth's baby. Seth attempts to kill himself, but is swallowed by a whale and the belly is cut open and Seth is released. Rachel decides to marry Seth and raise the baby with him. Harry stands on top of a building with Seth's crippled dog the same way Seth did before and asks for a sign from God. Perhaps to be saved like Seth was.\nCritical reception.\nThe film has received negative reviews, with a 24% \"rotten\" rating by the review aggregator &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, based on 17 reviews."
