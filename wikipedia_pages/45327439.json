    "text": "Jurimetrics is the application of quantitative methods, and often especially &lt;a href=\"Probability%20theory\"&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, the journal \"&lt;a href=\"Jurimetrics%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Jurimetrics&lt;/a&gt;\" is published by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Bar%20Association\"&gt;American Bar Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20State%20University\"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Empirical%20Legal%20Studies\"&gt;Journal of Empirical Legal Studies&lt;/a&gt;\" is another publication that emphasizes the statistical analysis of law.\nThe term was coined in 1949 by &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Loevinger\"&gt;Lee Loevinger&lt;/a&gt; in his article \"Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward\". Showing the influence of &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Loevinger quoted Holmes' celebrated phrase that:\nThe first work on this topic is attributed to &lt;a href=\"Nicolaus%20I%20Bernoulli\"&gt;Nicolaus I Bernoulli&lt;/a&gt; in his doctoral dissertation \"De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure\", written in 1709.\nApplications.\nGender quotas on corporate boards.\nIn 2018, California's &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; passed Senate Bill 826, which requires all publicly held corporations based in the state to have a &lt;a href=\"Gender%20representation%20on%20corporate%20boards%20of%20directors%23Gender%20quotas\"&gt;minimum number of women&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20directors\"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt;. Boards with five or fewer members must have at least two women, while boards with six or more members must have at least three women.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"binomial%20distribution\"&gt;binomial distribution&lt;/a&gt;, we may compute what the probability is of violating the rule laid out in Senate Bill 826 by the number of board members. The &lt;a href=\"probability%20mass%20function\"&gt;probability mass function&lt;/a&gt; for the binomial distribution is:formula_1where formula_2 is the probability of getting formula_3 successes in formula_4 trials, and formula_5 is the &lt;a href=\"binomial%20coefficient\"&gt;binomial coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. For this computation, formula_2 is the probability that a person qualified for board service is female, formula_3 is the number of female board members, and formula_4 is the number of board seats. We will assume that formula_9.\nDepending on the number of board members, we are trying compute the &lt;a href=\"cumulative%20distribution%20function\"&gt;cumulative distribution function&lt;/a&gt;:formula_10With these formulas, we are able to compute the probability of violating Senate Bill 826 by chance:\nAs &lt;a href=\"Ilya%20Somin\"&gt;Ilya Somin&lt;/a&gt; points out, a significant percentage of firms - without any history of &lt;a href=\"Sexism\"&gt;sex discrimination&lt;/a&gt; - could be in violation of the law.\nIn more male-dominated industries, such as &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Valley\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, there could be an even greater imbalance. Suppose that instead of parity in general, the probability that a person who is qualified for board service is female is 40%; this is likely to be a high estimate, given the predominance of males in the technology industry. Then the probability of violating Senate Bill 826 by chance may be recomputed as:\nBayesian analysis of evidence.\n&lt;a href=\"Bayes%27%20theorem\"&gt;Bayes' theorem&lt;/a&gt; states that, for events formula_11 and formula_12, the &lt;a href=\"conditional%20probability\"&gt;conditional probability&lt;/a&gt; of formula_11 occurring, given that formula_12 has occurred, is:formula_15Using the &lt;a href=\"law%20of%20total%20probability\"&gt;law of total probability&lt;/a&gt;, we may expand the denominator as:formula_16Then Bayes' theorem may be rewritten as:formula_17This may be simplified further by defining the &lt;a href=\"Prior%20probability\"&gt;prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"odds\"&gt;odds&lt;/a&gt; of event formula_11 occurring formula_19 and the &lt;a href=\"likelihood%20ratio\"&gt;likelihood ratio&lt;/a&gt; formula_20 as:formula_21Then the compact form of Bayes' theorem is:formula_22Different values of the &lt;a href=\"posterior%20probability\"&gt;posterior probability&lt;/a&gt;, based on the prior odds and likelihood ratio, are computed in the following table:\nIf we take formula_11 to be some criminal behavior and formula_12 a criminal complaint or accusation, Bayes' theorem allows us to determine the conditional probability of a crime being committed. More sophisticated analyses of evidence can be undertaken with the use of &lt;a href=\"Bayesian%20network\"&gt;Bayesian networks&lt;/a&gt;.\nScreening of drug users, mass shooters, and terrorists.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of &lt;a href=\"Screening%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;screening tests&lt;/a&gt; to identify &lt;a href=\"Drug%20testing%20welfare%20recipients\"&gt;drug users on welfare&lt;/a&gt;, potential &lt;a href=\"Mass%20shootings%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;mass shooters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terrorist%20Screening%20Database\"&gt;terrorists&lt;/a&gt;. The efficacy of screening tests can be analyzed using Bayes' theorem.\nSuppose that there is some binary screening procedure for an action formula_25 that identifies a person as testing positive formula_26 or negative formula_27 for the action. Bayes' theorem tells us that the conditional probability of taking action formula_25, given a positive test result, is:formula_29For any screening test, we must be cognizant of its &lt;a href=\"sensitivity%20and%20specificity\"&gt;sensitivity and specificity&lt;/a&gt;. The screening test has sensitivity formula_30 and specificity formula_31. The sensitivity and specificity can be analyzed using concepts from the standard theory of &lt;a href=\"statistical%20hypothesis%20testing\"&gt;statistical hypothesis testing&lt;/a&gt;:\nTherefore, the form of Bayes' theorem that is pertinent to us is:formula_36Suppose that we have developed a test with sensitivity and specificity of 99%, which is likely to be higher than most real-world tests. We can examine several scenarios to see how well this hypothetical test works:\nWith these base rates and the hypothetical values of sensitivity and specificity, we may calculate the posterior probability that a positive result indicates the individual will actually engage in each of the actions:\nEven with very high sensitivity and specificity, the screening tests only return posterior probabilities of 60.1% and 0.98% respectively for each action. Under more realistic circumstances, it is likely that screening would prove even less useful than under these hypothetical conditions. The problem with any screening procedure for &lt;a href=\"rare%20events\"&gt;rare events&lt;/a&gt; is that it is very likely to be too imprecise, which will &lt;a href=\"False%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives%23False%20positive%20error\"&gt;identify too many&lt;/a&gt; people of being at risk of engaging in some undesirable action.\nJurimetrics and law and economics.\nThe difference between jurimetrics and &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Economics\"&gt;law and economics&lt;/a&gt; is that jurimetrics investigates legal questions from a probabilistic/statistical point of view, while &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Economics\"&gt;law and economics&lt;/a&gt; addresses legal questions using standard &lt;a href=\"Microeconomics\"&gt;microeconomic analysis&lt;/a&gt;. A synthesis of these fields is possible through the use of &lt;a href=\"econometrics\"&gt;econometrics&lt;/a&gt; (statistics for economic analysis) and other &lt;a href=\"Mathematical%20economics\"&gt;quantitative methods&lt;/a&gt; to answer relevant legal matters. As an example, the Columbia University scholar &lt;a href=\"Edgardo%20Buscaglia\"&gt;Edgardo Buscaglia&lt;/a&gt; published several peer-reviewed articles by using a joint jurimetrics and &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Economics\"&gt;law and economics&lt;/a&gt; approach."
