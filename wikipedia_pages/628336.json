    "text": "A master craftsman or master &lt;a href=\"tradesman\"&gt;tradesman&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes called only master or grandmaster) was a member of a &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the European &lt;a href=\"Guild%23Organization\"&gt;guild system&lt;/a&gt;, only masters and journeymen were allowed to be members of the guild. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"journeyman\"&gt;journeyman&lt;/a&gt; before he could be elected to become a master craftsman. He would then have to produce a sum of money and a &lt;a href=\"masterpiece\"&gt;masterpiece&lt;/a&gt; before he could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, he was not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of his life.\nHistory.\nCraftsman or &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt; was who made things or provided services. Mastercraftsman was the superior, and expert craftsman called \"ustad\" and &lt;a href=\"Apprenticeship\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt; was called \"shagird\" in &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20India\"&gt;Medieval India&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"grand%20vizier\"&gt;grand vizier&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Akbar\"&gt;Akbar&lt;/a&gt; discussed their social status and importance in &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Karkhanas\"&gt;karkhanas&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday's master craftsman in different countries.\nGermany.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the master craftsman (Meister) is the highest professional qualification in crafts and is a state-approved grade. The certification is called Meisterbrief. The qualification includes theoretical and practical training in the craft as well as &lt;a href=\"business\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; and legal training. Additionally, it implies the qualification to train apprentices. These qualifications prepare the \"Meister\" for running their own business or alternatively for higher positions at a company. The status of master craftsmen is regulated in the German \"Gesetz zur Ordnung des Handwerks\" (&lt;a href=\"Trade%20and%20crafts%20code%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Crafts and Trades Regulation Code&lt;/a&gt;).\nGuilds have been abolished in Germany, but the ranks of apprentice (\"Lehrling\"), journeyman (\"Geselle\") and master craftsman have been retained even through modern times. For safety-relevant crafts, e.g., &lt;a href=\"electrician\"&gt;electrician&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chimney%20sweep\"&gt;chimney sweep&lt;/a&gt;s, any business in the trade has to be run by a master craftsman or has to employ at least one \"Meister\".\nJourneymen and master craftsmen are by law automatically members of their regional chamber of crafts (\"Handwerkskammer\"), which is a self-governing public body. The chamber organizes vocational training and oversees the examination of the journeymen and masters.\nTo become a master craftsman, it is usually required to have completed vocational training in the craft in which the examination should be taken, which finishes with a final examination called \"Gesellenpr\u00fcfung\" (journeyman's examination). If these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate can take courses for the \"Meisterpr\u00fcfung\" (master craftman's examination). The duration of the courses takes 4 to 6 years depending on the craft. The examination includes theoretical, practical and oral parts and takes 5 to 7 days (depending on the craft). In some crafts, the creation of a &lt;a href=\"masterpiece\"&gt;masterpiece&lt;/a&gt; is also part of the examination.\nThe German \"Meister\" qualifies the holder to study for a bachelor's degree at &lt;a href=\"university\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;, whether the \"Meister\" holds a regular &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Germany%23University%20entrance%20qualification\"&gt;university entrance qualification&lt;/a&gt; or not. According to the German &lt;a href=\"National%20Qualifications%20Framework\"&gt;Qualifications Framework&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Meisterbrief\" is at the same level as a bachelor's degree, even though it is not an academic degree and thus not directly comparable.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThis tradition originates in Medieval Europe. The earliest guilds were \"frith\" or \"peace\" guilds - groups bonded together for mutual protection following the breakdown of the kins, which were groups related by blood ties.\nMerchant guilds \u2013 associations of international trades \u2013 were powerful in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but lost their ascendancy with the rise of the &lt;a href=\"craft%20guilds\"&gt;craft guilds&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 associations of master craftsmen, journeymen, apprentices and the various trades connected with a particular craft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Arms\"&gt;College of Arms&lt;/a&gt; in London awarded a coat of arms of &lt;a href=\"The%20Guild%20of%20Master%20Craftsmen\"&gt;The Guild of Master Craftsmen&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, after four years of assessment. Designed by heraldic expert Peter Greenhill to reflect the many categories of guild membership, it features: three escutcheons (shields) to represent &lt;a href=\"artists\"&gt;artists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"painters\"&gt;painters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Painter-Stainers\"&gt;stainers&lt;/a&gt;; a pair of compasses opened in chevron for &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"construction\"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carpenters\"&gt;carpenters&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"dovetail\"&gt;dovetail&lt;/a&gt; (separating the top third of the shield from the rest) to represent &lt;a href=\"cabinetmaking\"&gt;cabinetmaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodworking\"&gt;woodworking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"joiner\"&gt;joiner&lt;/a&gt;y; and a &lt;a href=\"gavel\"&gt;gavel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chisel\"&gt;chisel&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"masonry\"&gt;masons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stoneworkers\"&gt;stoneworkers&lt;/a&gt;. The southern keep of &lt;a href=\"Lewes\"&gt;Lewes&lt;/a&gt; Castle, which overlooks the guild\u2019s headquarters, is featured above the helmet as the crest.\nUnited States.\nWhile for the most part guilds as such do not exist, many trades continue the apprentice-journeyman-master model: &lt;a href=\"carpenter\"&gt;carpenter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"electrician\"&gt;electrician&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pipefitter\"&gt;pipefitter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"plumber\"&gt;plumber&lt;/a&gt;s are notable examples."
