    "text": "Mike Shelley (born 13 March 1972 in &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;) is a former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player who became the longest serving player in the history of &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Tykes\"&gt;Leeds Tykes&lt;/a&gt; rugby club, having joined them in 1996 from &lt;a href=\"West%20Hartlepool%20R.F.C.\"&gt;West Hartlepool&lt;/a&gt;. He made his Tykes debut against &lt;a href=\"Otley%20RUFC\"&gt;Otley RUFC&lt;/a&gt; on 31 August 1996.\nAt the end of the 2005\u201306 season, despite being due a testimonial, he made the decision to retire after 10 years and 244 appearances for the club.\nShelley was made captain for the 2000\u201301 season, a role he continued until the 2003\u201304 campaign.\nThat campaign saw Shelley reach the 200 appearance mark for the Tykes and he enjoyed one of his proudest moments for the club when he lifted the &lt;a href=\"Powergen%20Cup\"&gt;Powergen Cup&lt;/a&gt; after their win over &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath Rugby&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. Although &lt;a href=\"Iain%20Balshaw\"&gt;Iain Balshaw&lt;/a&gt; was the official captain on that day, he went off injured early in the game and Shelley took the on-field captaincy.\nShelley started his career at local club side &lt;a href=\"Moortown%2C%20Leeds\"&gt;Moortown&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them after one season to join West Park Bramhope. He did not become a prop until he went to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20University\"&gt;Newcastle University&lt;/a&gt; where he played first for &lt;a href=\"Medicals%20RFC\"&gt;Medicals RFC&lt;/a&gt; and the University's 1st XV but a year later he was in Bramhope's 1st XV and two years after that he was playing in the First Division with West Hartlepool.\nAfter two seasons with Wests, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Davies\"&gt;Phil Davies&lt;/a&gt; persuaded him to step down two divisions to join the new set up at Headingley, where he was given the role of development officer.\nTwo seasons in the 3rd division and three in the 2nd put his international career on hold for five years or so, but he returned to the England set-up with a return to the Premiership. In 2002 Shelley was called in to the &lt;a href=\"England%20Saxons\"&gt;England 'A'&lt;/a&gt; side, and again in 2003.\nShelley's form at the end of the 2004\u201305 season saw him recalled to the England 'A' side, when he joined the team for the &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20Cup\"&gt;Churchill Cup&lt;/a&gt; tournament.\nShelley now resides in Calgary, where he is the coach for local rugby team &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20Wolf%20Pack\"&gt;Prairie Wolf Pack&lt;/a&gt;."
