    "title": "STS-115",
    "text": "STS-115 was a &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle\"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; mission to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) flown by . It was the first &lt;a href=\"ISS%20assembly%20sequence\"&gt;assembly mission&lt;/a&gt; to the ISS after the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster\"&gt;\"Columbia\" disaster&lt;/a&gt;, following the two successful \"Return to Flight\" missions, &lt;a href=\"STS-114\"&gt;STS-114&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"STS-121\"&gt;STS-121&lt;/a&gt;. STS-115 launched from &lt;a href=\"LC-39B\"&gt;LC-39B&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; on 9 September 2006 at 11:14:55 &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (15:14:55 &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe mission is also referred to as ISS-12A by the ISS program. The mission delivered the second port-side &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20Truss%20Structure\"&gt;truss&lt;/a&gt; segment (ITS P3/P4), a pair of &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Solar%20Arrays\"&gt;solar arrays&lt;/a&gt; (2A and 4A), and &lt;a href=\"Electric%20battery\"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;. A total of three spacewalks were performed, during which the crew connected the systems on the installed trusses, prepared them for deployment, and did other maintenance work on the station.\nSTS-115 was originally scheduled to launch in April 2003. The &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster\"&gt;\"Columbia\" accident&lt;/a&gt; in February 2003 pushed the date back to 27 August 2006, which was again moved back for various reasons, including a threat from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29\"&gt;Tropical Storm Ernesto&lt;/a&gt; and the strongest lightning strike to ever hit an occupied shuttle launchpad.\nCrew.\nCrew notes.\nCanadian Space Agency astronaut MacLean became the first Canadian to operate &lt;a href=\"Canadarm2\"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt; and its Mobile Base in space as he was handed a new set of solar arrays from Ferguson and Burbank controlling the original Canadian robotic arm, the &lt;a href=\"Canadarm\"&gt;Canadarm&lt;/a&gt;. MacLean performed a spacewalk, becoming only the second Canadian, after &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Hadfield\"&gt;Chris Hadfield&lt;/a&gt; to do so.\nThe mission patch worn on the clothing used by the astronauts of STS-115 was designed by Graham Huber, Peter Hui, and Gigi Lui, three students at &lt;a href=\"York%20University\"&gt;York University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, the same university that Steve MacLean attended. The students also designed Steve MacLean's personal patch for this mission.\nMission payloads.\nThe primary payload was the second left-side &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20Truss%20Structure\"&gt;ITS P3/P4 Truss&lt;/a&gt; segment, a pair of &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Solar%20Arrays\"&gt;solar arrays&lt;/a&gt;, and associated batteries.\nMission background.\nNASA managers decided to move the STS-115 launch date forward to 27 August to obtain better lighting conditions to photograph the external tank. This occurred before with &lt;a href=\"STS-31\"&gt;STS-31&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"STS-82\"&gt;STS-82&lt;/a&gt;. The launch window was co-ordinated with the &lt;a href=\"Soyuz%20TMA-9\"&gt;Soyuz TMA-9&lt;/a&gt; launch in mid-September, which delivered a new ISS crew and fresh supplies to the station. The &lt;a href=\"Soyuz%20spacecraft\"&gt;Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; operationally did not dock to the station while the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle\"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; was there.\nThe mission marks:\nMission timeline.\nLaunch preparations.\n\"Atlantis\" was rolled out from the &lt;a href=\"Orbiter%20Processing%20Facility\"&gt;Orbiter Processing Facility&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building\"&gt;Vehicle Assembly Building&lt;/a&gt; (VAB) on 24 July 2006. It was lowered onto the &lt;a href=\"mobile%20launcher%20platform\"&gt;mobile launcher platform&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July and rolled out to &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Complex%2039\"&gt;Pad 39B&lt;/a&gt; in the early morning hours of 2 August. The rollout was scheduled for 31 July, but a storm in the vicinity of the &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a delay of two days from fears of the orbiter being hit by lightning, which could cause immeasurable damage.\nOn the weekend of 5 to 6 August 2006, engineers completed a \"flight readiness\" check of the shuttle's main engines, which were deemed ready for launch. The crew arrived at the Kennedy Space Center 7 August 2006 for four days of launch rehearsals, including a practice countdown 10 August.\nTop NASA managers held a Flight Readiness Review (FRR) meeting 15\u201316 August 2006 to finalize the launch date. Foam loss from the &lt;a href=\"external%20tank\"&gt;external tank&lt;/a&gt; was a key issue at this meeting because on 13 August 2006, NASA announced there was an average amount of loss from the external tank of STS-121, the previous mission. \"Columbia\"'s demise was due to a piece of foam, shed from its external tank, striking the shuttle's left wing during launch and causing a hole that was breached during re-entry.\nThe meeting also discussed problems with the bolts securing the shuttle's &lt;a href=\"Ku-band\"&gt;Ku-band&lt;/a&gt; antenna, which might not have been threaded correctly. The installation had been in place for several flights and hadn't experienced any problems. At the end of the two-day meeting, NASA managers had decided to proceed with the launch on 27 August 2006. However, on 18 August 2006, NASA decided to replace the antenna bolts with \"Atlantis\" still on the launch pad. NASA had no procedure to replace these on the pad, but the work was nonetheless completed by 20 August, without affecting the planned launch date.\nOn 25 August 2006, a direct lightning strike, the most powerful recorded at Kennedy Space Center, hit the lightning rod atop the launch pad. As a result, on 26 August the Mission Management Team ordered the mission postponed for at least 24 hours to assess damage. On 27 August, the decision was made to postpone the launch for another 24 hours, making the earliest possible launch date 29 August 2006, still unassured that there was no damage from the lightning strike and taking into account the possible threat from &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29\"&gt;Hurricane Ernesto&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 August 2006 it was decided to postpone the launch and rollback \"Atlantis\" to the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building\"&gt;VAB&lt;/a&gt; after updated forecasts projected Hurricane Ernesto would regain its strength and pass closer to Kennedy Space Center than previously anticipated. NASA began rolling back the shuttle on 29 August 2006 in the late morning, but by early afternoon the decision was made to move \"Atlantis\" back to the launch pad (something that has never been done before) to weather out &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29\"&gt;Tropical Storm Ernesto&lt;/a&gt; instead. The change came after weather forecasters determined that the storm wouldn't hit &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; as forcefully as they once thought. Its peak winds were expected to be less than 79\u00a0mph (126 kilometers per hour), NASA's limit for keeping the shuttle outdoors.\nBy the early morning of 31 August 2006, the storm had passed and inspection teams began a survey for damage to the launch facilities. Only three problems were discovered, all of which were simple repairs. A target date for launch was set for 6 September with the option to launch for another two days after NASA and Russian space managers agreed to extend the launch window by one day.\nOn the morning of 3 September 2006, the official countdown began at the T minus 43-hour mark, with about 30 hours of scheduled holds. In the early morning of 6 September 2006, engineers observed an apparent internal short when one of the three electricity producing fuel cells was powered up. When engineers couldn't figure out the problem in time, the launch was scrubbed for the day to further analyze the fuel cell problem. Late Wednesday evening NASA managers decided that they would not attempt a launch on Thursday, and scheduled the next launch attempt for 8 September 2006. Originally they had ruled out 9 September as a potential launch date due to a conflict with the planned Russian &lt;a href=\"Soyuz%20program\"&gt;Soyuz&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"Soyuz%20TMA-9\"&gt;Soyuz TMA-9&lt;/a&gt;, which was scheduled to, and did, launch on 18 September 2006. This caused some news agencies to report that Friday as the last chance for a launch until October.\n8 September (Launch attempt 1).\nOn the morning of 8 September 2006, it was reported that one of the engine cut-off (ECO) sensors in the external tank had failed. About half an hour before the scheduled launch time, NASA announced it had decided to delay the launch for another 24 hours while the fuel was drained out of the external tank and the problem assessed. The sensor in question, ECO sensor No. 3, was proved to be faulty when it indicated that there was still liquid hydrogen in the external tank despite all of it being drained out. The other three ECO sensors correctly indicated a dry tank; and as long as they didn't start to malfunction, NASA could allow a launch with three out of the four ECO sensors operational.\n9 September (Flight day 1, Launch).\nOn 9 September 2006, all the engine cut-off sensors were working properly, and following a flawless countdown, at 15:15 &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (11:15 &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;), \"Atlantis\" lifted off the launch pad to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. As \"Atlantis\" launched, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; was (220\u00a0mi) above the northern Atlantic Ocean, between &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the climb to orbit, Mission Control asked the crew to reconfigure a cooling system that apparently had ice build up. The reconfiguration cleared the system, called the Flash Evaporator System, and it operated normally. Temporary ice in that cooling unit is not uncommon and has occurred on previous missions.\nMoments after main engine cutoff, 8.5 minutes after liftoff, Tanner and MacLean used hand-held video and digital still cameras to document the external tank after it separated from the shuttle. That imagery, as well as imagery gathered by cameras in the shuttle's umbilical well where the tank was connected, was transmitted to the ground for review.\n10 September (Flight day 2).\nDuring their first full day in space, the crew thoroughly examined \"Atlantis\" with the &lt;a href=\"Orbiter%20Boom%20Sensor%20System\"&gt;Orbiter Boom Sensor System&lt;/a&gt;, the 15 meter (50-foot) long extension for the shuttle's &lt;a href=\"Canadarm\"&gt;robotic arm&lt;/a&gt;. Pilot Chris Ferguson and mission specialists &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20C.%20Burbank\"&gt;Dan Burbank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steven%20MacLean%20%28astronaut%29\"&gt;Steve MacLean&lt;/a&gt; performed a slow, steady inspection of the reinforced carbon-carbon panels along the leading edge of \"Atlantis\"' &lt;a href=\"starboard\"&gt;starboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; wings and the nose cap.\nThe crew worked ahead of schedule for most of the day readying the ship for docking and preparing for the mission's three planned &lt;a href=\"extra-vehicular%20activity\"&gt;extra-vehicular activities&lt;/a&gt; (EVA). Mission specialists &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20R.%20Tanner\"&gt;Joe Tanner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heidemarie%20M.%20Stefanyshyn-Piper\"&gt;Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper&lt;/a&gt; checked out the &lt;a href=\"spacesuit\"&gt;spacesuit&lt;/a&gt;s and tools that they, Burbank and MacLean used during spacewalks set for Days 4, 5, and 7. The spacewalks installed the girder-like &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Truss\"&gt;P3/P4 truss&lt;/a&gt;, deploy new &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Solar%20Arrays\"&gt;solar arrays&lt;/a&gt;, and prepare them for operation.\nOn the space station, &lt;a href=\"Expedition%2013\"&gt;Expedition 13&lt;/a&gt; Flight Engineer &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Williams%20%28astronaut%29\"&gt;Jeffrey Williams&lt;/a&gt; prepared the orbiting laboratory for \"Atlantis\"' arrival on Day 3. He readied the digital cameras that was used to take high-resolution photos of the shuttle's heat shield. With help from Commander &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Vinogradov\"&gt;Pavel Vinogradov&lt;/a&gt;, Williams pressurized the Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Destiny%20Laboratory%20Module\"&gt;Destiny Laboratory Module&lt;/a&gt;, where \"Atlantis\" later docked. Vinogradov also prepacked equipment to be returned.\n11 September (Flight day 3).\nPrior to docking, Jett flew \"Atlantis\" through an orbital back flip while stationed about 180 meters (600\u00a0feet) below the space station. The maneuver allowed the Expedition 13 crew to take a series of high-resolution photographs of the orbiter's heat shield.\nAt about 10:46 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; \"Atlantis\" docked with the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, and almost two hours later the hatch between them was opened, and the crew was welcomed aboard the station at 12:35 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing docking, Ferguson and Burbank attached the shuttle's robotic &lt;a href=\"Canadarm\"&gt;Canadarm&lt;/a&gt; to the 17.5-ton &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Truss\"&gt;P3/P4 truss&lt;/a&gt;, lifted it from its berth in the payload bay, and maneuvered it for handover to the station's &lt;a href=\"Canadarm2\"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter hatch opening, MacLean and Expedition 13 Flight Engineer Jeff Williams then used the Canadarm2 to take the truss from the shuttle's robotic arm. MacLean is the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm2 in space.\nTanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began the \"camping out\" preparations in the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Airlock\"&gt;Quest Airlock&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for a Day 4 spacewalk. The preparations are new pre-breathing measures on the part of NASA, to avoid &lt;a href=\"decompression%20sickness\"&gt;decompression sickness&lt;/a&gt;, or \"the bends\", by getting rid of some &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; in their bloodstreams. The preparations involve wearing oxygen masks and sleeping overnight in the airlock with the airlock at under 69 kPa (10 &lt;a href=\"Pound-force%20per%20square%20inch\"&gt;psi&lt;/a&gt;), to acclimate their bodies the low pressures they will encounter when wearing their &lt;a href=\"spacesuit\"&gt;spacesuit&lt;/a&gt;s.\n12 September (Flight day 4).\nFollowing the installation of the &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Truss\"&gt;P3/P4 Truss&lt;/a&gt; to the ISS by the &lt;a href=\"Canadarm2\"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt;, Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk to activate the truss at 09:17 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. During the EVA they installed power and data cables between the P1 &amp; P3/P4 trusses, released the P3/P4 truss' launch restraints and a number of other tasks to configure the truss for upcoming activities. The spacewalk was so successful that the astronauts carried out a number of tasks scheduled for later EVAs, with the eventual completion of the EVA at 15:43 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. A bolt, spring and washer assembly from a launch lock was lost during these extra activities and floated off into space.\nFollowing the completion of the EVA, the station's crew began preparing for Day 5's spacewalk, with astronauts Burbank and MacLean entering the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Airlock\"&gt;Quest Airlock&lt;/a&gt; for their \"camp out\" at 18:40 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, ready for the scheduled 09:15 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; EVA.\n13 September (Flight day 5).\nOn Day 5, the second spacewalk of the mission was conducted, this time by first-time spacewalkers Burbank and MacLean. They devoted the day to the final tasks required for activation of the &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20Truss%20Structure\"&gt;Solar Alpha Rotary Joint&lt;/a&gt; (SARJ). The SARJ is an automobile-sized joint that will allow the station's &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Solar%20Arrays\"&gt;solar arrays&lt;/a&gt; to turn and point toward the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;. Burbank and MacLean released locks that had held the joint secure during its launch to orbit aboard \"&lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;\". As they worked, the spacewalkers overcame several minor problems, including a malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"helmet%20camera\"&gt;helmet camera&lt;/a&gt;, a broken socket tool, a stubborn bolt, and a bolt that came loose from the mechanism designed to hold it captive. The stubborn bolt required the force of both spacewalkers to finally remove it.\nBurbank and MacLean spent 7 hours and 11 minutes outside the station, beginning their spacewalk at 09:05 &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Coordinated%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; and completing it at 16:16 UTC. In addition to the SARJ work, they completed several \"get-ahead\" tasks during their time outside.\nEngineers encountered a glitch during the four-hour activation and checkout of SARJ, and had temporarily delayed starting the deployment of the new solar arrays pending further work and checkout of the SARJ. The timeline allowed ample time to continue working on the problem during the night and still complete the deploy of the arrays on Thursday as scheduled.\n14 September (Flight day 6).\nDay 6 continued the installation of the &lt;a href=\"ISS%20Solar%20Arrays\"&gt;solar array&lt;/a&gt;. The unfurling of the &lt;a href=\"Photovoltaic%20module\"&gt;solar panel&lt;/a&gt;s themselves began a little behind schedule due to the problem encountered on Day 5 with SARJ. This problem was determined to be in the software, and a workaround was developed. The unfurling of the panels continued throughout the morning in stages to prevent the panels sticking, as they did during &lt;a href=\"STS-97\"&gt;STS-97&lt;/a&gt;. It was noted by the crew that some panels were still sticking together, but this didn't cause any problems. Although the installation has been completed, the solar arrays will not provide power to the station until the next shuttle mission, &lt;a href=\"STS-116\"&gt;STS-116&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled for December 2006, when the station will undergo a major electrical system rewiring.\nOther activities of Day 6 included a \"double walk off\" of the station's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Servicing%20System\"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt; from its current location at the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Servicing%20System\"&gt;Mobile Base System&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Destiny%20Laboratory%20Module\"&gt;Destiny Laboratory Module&lt;/a&gt; and the preparation for the mission's third spacewalk. A number of interviews were also conducted later in the day, between Jett &amp; MacLean and Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Harper\"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; &amp; students.\n15 September (Flight day 7).\nFlight day 7 featured the third and final spacewalk of mission STS-115.\nThe start of the spacewalk was delayed after a &lt;a href=\"circuit%20breaker\"&gt;circuit-breaker&lt;/a&gt;-like remote power controller (RPC) tripped, causing loss of power to the airlock's depressurization pump. This was attributed to a momentary spike in the electric current of the depressurization pump. After assessing data to ensure the system had no &lt;a href=\"short%20circuit\"&gt;short circuit&lt;/a&gt;, the breaker was reset and pump reactivated. Joe Tanner and Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk at 10:00 &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; after a 45-minute delay\nDuring the 6-hour and 42-minute spacewalk, the astronauts carried out numerous maintenance and repair tasks including removal of hardware used to secure the P3/P4 radiator during launch. Ground Flight Controllers subsequently unfurled the radiator, increasing the ability of the station to dissipate heat into space. Also, completed during this spacewalk was the retrieval of a &lt;a href=\"Materials%20International%20Space%20Station%20Experiment%23MISSE-5\"&gt;materials exposure experiment&lt;/a&gt; from the outside of the ISS, maintenance on the P6 truss, installation of a wireless TV aerial and the replacement of the S1 truss' S-band antenna assembly.\nA number of \"get-ahead\" tasks previously scheduled for future missions were also performed during this spacewalk. Near the end of the spacewalk, the astronauts carried out a test to evaluate using infrared video of the leading edge of &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;\"Atlantis\"'&lt;/a&gt; wing to detect debris damage.\nAfter the spacewalk, the station's mobile transporter was moved to a worksite on the P3 truss to inspect portions of that truss.\n16 September (Flight day 8).\nDay 8 of STS-115, the last full day with Space Shuttle \"&lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;\" docked to the ISS, was mainly spent in preparation for the undocking procedures to occur in flight day 9. The crew spent the morning resting following their highly successful mission, and then began getting ready for the undocking by carrying out transfers of ISS equipment and science experiments onto \"Atlantis\" ready for the trip home.\nThe crews of &lt;a href=\"Expedition%2013\"&gt;Expedition 13&lt;/a&gt; and STS-115 also took part in the traditional joint-crew news conference, with mission Commander Brent Jett commenting on the success of the mission and on the construction missions to follow:\n\"All of the rest of the assembly missions are going to be challenging. We have similar payloads flying in the future. We are off to a good start on assembly. I think we can pass along a lot of the lessons to the future crews.\"\n17 September (Flight day 9).\nFlight day 9 saw the end of STS-115's tasks at the ISS as \"&lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;\" undocked from the International Space Station at 12:50 &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the traditional farewell ceremonies between Expedition 13 and STS-115, the hatch between \"Atlantis\" and the ISS was closed and locked at 10:27 UTC. Then, after a series of checks for leaks, \"Atlantis\" left the dock to begin its 360-degree flyaround of the expanded ISS to document the new configuration.\n18 September (Flight day 10).\nThe crew of STS-115 spent the morning of Flight Day 10 carrying out final inspections of &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;\"Atlantis\"&lt;/a&gt; heat shield in preparation for re-entry on flight day 12.\nOrbiting around behind the ISS, the crew used the Orbiter's robotic arm and boom sensor system to make sure that no damage had been done to \"Atlantis\" nose and wing leading edges by micrometeoroids and other space junk. The crew spent the rest of this light duty day stowing equipment in preparation for re-entry and landing.\n19 September (Flight day 11).\nDuring the morning of day 11, astronauts Jett and Ferguson tested \"Atlantis\"' reaction control thrusters and practiced for landing using on-board computers. The thrusters will be used to position the shuttle during re-entry.\nThe crew also took some time for interviews, with Ferguson telling the media that everyone on board was looking forward to landing. \"I think we all, thus far, feel pretty good about the job that we did,\" Ferguson said. \"We are looking forward to a successful re-entry and landing sometime tomorrow.\"\nFollowing the interviews, the crew continued their preparations for re-entry by stowing unnecessary equipment and other tasks prior to landing. However, the crew informed the Mission Control Center later in the day that, following the test of the reaction control system, an object was seen moving in a co-orbital path with the Orbiter. The astronauts spotted the object using an on-board TV camera, but unfortunately the resolution of the images was not high enough to identify the object.\nThe images were sent down to the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Control%20Center\"&gt;MCC&lt;/a&gt; for further analysis by flight controllers, who were concerned about the possibility that the object may have come off \"Atlantis\", and as such wished to identify the object. The most likely scenario was that the object was benign, such as ice or a piece of shimstock (observed earlier in the flight protruding from the heat shield) that may have shaken loose. However, the possibility remained that the object may be of critical importance, such as a tile from the Orbiter's thermal protection system, and the Mission Control Center asked \"Atlantis\" crew to power up the shuttle's robotic arm ready to reinspect the orbiter, and drew up plans for a series of tests which took place on flight day 12 to determine whether the shuttle was safe for re-entry. This extra inspection, added to poor weather forecasts predicted for the Shuttle Landing Facility for Wednesday, and the de-orbit burn and landing were delayed by a day.\n20 September (Flight day 12).\nFollowing the discovery of a co-orbiting object on flight day 11, Flight Controllers spent the early hours of the morning using the Orbiter's robotic arm to inspect the upper surface of \"Atlantis\", with the astronauts on board the Orbiter spending the rest of the morning scanning the underside of the shuttle for any areas of concern. Following these scans, the crew received word from the Mission Control Center in Houston to use the orbiter boom sensor system to conduct more inspections of \"Atlantis\"' heat shield.\nFollowing the review of these scans, together with an overnight analysis of the payload bay by Ground Flight Controllers, it was determined that there remained no safety issue with \"Atlantis\", and Mission Controllers cleared the Orbiter for re-entry. This clean bill of health, added to a favorable weather forecast for the Shuttle Landing Facility for Thursday morning, permitted \"Atlantis\" to be cleared for a landing the next day.\nThe crew spent the remainder of the day in preparation for landing, packing up gear and stowing the &lt;a href=\"Ku%20band\"&gt;Ku band&lt;/a&gt; antenna used for TV broadcasts. During the inspection, the crew was notified that the &lt;a href=\"Soyuz%20TMA-9\"&gt;Soyuz TMA-9&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft was docked with the ISS above, which carried the first half of the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%2014\"&gt;Expedition 14&lt;/a&gt; crew.\n21 September (Flight day 13 and landing).\nFlight day 13 was the last day of the mission, with the final re-entry procedures and landing taking place during the morning, and numerous debriefs and conferences in the afternoon. The landing process began hours before the actual landing at Kennedy Space Center. The process began with the APU prestart at 04:37 &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the closing of the payload bay doors and sealing of the Orbiter at 04:45 EDT. \"Atlantis\" crew received the final \"Go\" for the prime re-entry window from Mission Control in Houston at 04:52 EDT. The crew then started the deorbit reorientation of the shuttle so that its engines faced in its direction of travel, meaning that by firing the engines for the deorbit burn \"Atlantis\" would slow down and begin its descent out of orbit.\nThe de-orbit burn was initiated at 05:15 EDT, lasting 2 minutes 40 seconds with two engines burning well throughout. The astronauts aboard the Orbiter were informed at 05:17 EDT that their burn was perfect, with no alterations required as \"Atlantis\" began her drop through the atmosphere above the Indian Ocean.\nFollowing the deorbit burn, the crew of \"Atlantis\" began dumping excess propellant overboard, a process lasting 3 minutes, concluding at 05:26 EDT, with the Orbiter 55 minutes away from landing. Twenty-five minutes later, at 05:51 EDT, \"Atlantis\" began feeling the effects of the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately (80\u00a0mi), and soon after began its \"roll reversal banking\" in order to bleed off most of the /h (17,000\u00a0mph) she was traveling at, ready for landing at less than /h (470\u00a0mph). The ISS was positioned in such a way as to be above the reentry path taken by \"Atlantis\", so the astronauts were able to observe the entire maneuver from above.\nAt 06:08 EDT, the downlink from the Shuttle was acquired by the MILA tracking station on Merritt Island, Florida, with GPS data beginning to be accepted by the Orbiter three minutes later. Ten minutes following the first detection of \"Atlantis\", two &lt;a href=\"sonic%20boom\"&gt;sonic boom&lt;/a&gt;s were heard at Kennedy Space Center as the Orbiter dropped below the sound barrier three minutes prior to touchdown. Commander Jett took control of \"Atlantis\" a minute later, and, with Kennedy Space Center Runway 33 in sight, began bringing his ship in for a landing.\n\"Atlantis\"' main gear touched down at 06:21:30 EDT on Runway 33 at the Space Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, with the nose gear following 6 seconds later at 06:21:36 EDT, and, 8 million kilometers (5\u00a0million miles) after launch, the Orbiter's wheels came to a stop at 06:22:16 EDT, bringing mission STS-115 to an end.\nThe morning's landing was considered a night landing as it took place about 48 minutes before sunrise, and as such was the 21st night landing for the Space Shuttle Program. It was the 63rd landing at Kennedy Space Center, as well as the 27th mission for \"Atlantis\".\nPost flight.\nWhile working on the \"Atlantis\" orbiter, NASA technicians discovered that one of the spacecraft's radiator panels showed evidence of &lt;a href=\"micrometeorite\"&gt;micrometeorite&lt;/a&gt; damage. A hole was observed which was reported to be about 2.7\u00a0mm (0.108\u00a0in) in diameter.\nDebris analysis.\nNASA's Mission Management Team conducted a detailed analysis of data from many sources including ground imagery, radar, shuttle inspections using the &lt;a href=\"Canadarm\"&gt;Canadarm&lt;/a&gt; and from the space station. By Day 2 they pinpointed a handful of launch debris events, and drew a preliminary conclusion that the effect was minimal. Later that day, NASA agency engineers decided that additional heat shield inspections were not required. The preceding only relates to debris shed immediately during or after launch, and not the debris observed on 19 September 2006.\nNot mentioned was a large debris event during launch at 48 seconds near max Q. Because it happened on the ET side opposite the Orbiter, it was never a danger to the Shuttle. By the origin from near the top of the ET, it presents a new source of debris and is therefore of concern for further missions.\nWake-up calls.\nA tradition for NASA spaceflights since the days of &lt;a href=\"Project%20Gemini\"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, mission crews are played a special musical track at the start of each day in space. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.\nContingency mission.\n&lt;a href=\"STS-3xx\"&gt;STS-300&lt;/a&gt; was the designation given to the &lt;a href=\"Contingency%20Shuttle%20Crew%20Support\"&gt;Contingency Shuttle Crew Support&lt;/a&gt; mission which would have launched in the event &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery\"&gt;Space Shuttle \"Discovery\"&lt;/a&gt; became disabled during &lt;a href=\"STS-114\"&gt;STS-114&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"STS-121\"&gt;STS-121&lt;/a&gt;. This rescue mission would have been a modified version of the STS-115 mission with the launch date being brought forward and the crew reduced.\n&lt;a href=\"STS-3xx\"&gt;STS-300&lt;/a&gt; would have launched no earlier than 17 August 2006, and the crew for STS-300 would have been a four-person subset of the full STS-115 crew:\nExternal links.\nVideos.\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2006]]\n[[Category:Space Shuttle missions]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2006]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"
