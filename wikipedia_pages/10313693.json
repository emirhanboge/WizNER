    "text": "The election of a &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt; was generally a two-stage process whereby, from at least the 13th century, the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Romans\"&gt;King of the Romans&lt;/a&gt; was elected by a small body of the greatest princes of the Empire, the &lt;a href=\"prince-elector\"&gt;prince-elector&lt;/a&gt;s. This was then followed shortly thereafter by his &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;coronation as Emperor&lt;/a&gt; by the Pope. In 1356, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt; promulgated the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Bull%20of%201356\"&gt;Golden Bull&lt;/a&gt;, which became the fundamental law by which all future kings and emperors were elected. After 1508, the Pope recognized election alone to be sufficient for the use of the Imperial title. The last papal coronation took place in 1530.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the best-known example of an &lt;a href=\"elective%20monarchy\"&gt;elective monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, only members of the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were elected emperor between 1438 and 1740, making the empire a \"&lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"hereditary%20monarchy\"&gt;hereditary monarchy&lt;/a&gt; during that period.\nBackground.\nThe \"K\u00f6nigswahl\" was the election of royal candidates in the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and its predecessors as &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; by a specified elective body (the \"Gremium\"). Whilst the &lt;a href=\"succession%20to%20the%20throne\"&gt;succession to the throne&lt;/a&gt; of the monarch in most cultures is governed by the rules of &lt;a href=\"hereditary%20succession\"&gt;hereditary succession&lt;/a&gt;, there are also &lt;a href=\"elective%20monarchies\"&gt;elective monarchies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere were elective monarchies in several Germanic successor states after the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt; from 1573 to 1795 (see &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Poland\"&gt;History of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, period of the Aristocratic Republic).\nPrince-electors.\nFrom the 13th century, the right to elect kings in the Holy Roman Empire was granted to a limited number of &lt;a href=\"imperial%20prince\"&gt;imperial prince&lt;/a&gt;s, the so-called &lt;a href=\"prince-elector\"&gt;prince-elector&lt;/a&gt;s. There are various theories over the emergence of their exclusive election right.\nThe secular electoral seats were hereditary. However, spiritual electors (and other prince-(arch)bishops) were usually elected by the &lt;a href=\"cathedral%20chapter\"&gt;cathedral chapter&lt;/a&gt;s as religious leaders, but simultaneously ruled as monarch (prince) of a territory of &lt;a href=\"imperial%20immediacy\"&gt;imperial immediacy&lt;/a&gt; (which usually comprised a part of their diocesan territory). Thus the &lt;a href=\"prince-bishopric\"&gt;prince-bishopric&lt;/a&gt;s were elective monarchies too. The same holds true for prince-abbeys, whose prince-abbesses or &lt;a href=\"prince-abbot\"&gt;prince-abbot&lt;/a&gt;s were elected by a &lt;a href=\"college%20%28canon%20law%29\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; of clerics and imperially appointed as princely rulers in a pertaining territory.\nInitially seven &lt;a href=\"Prince-elector\"&gt;elector&lt;/a&gt;s chose the \"&lt;a href=\"King%20of%20the%20Romans\"&gt;King of the Romans&lt;/a&gt;\" as the Emperor's designated heir was known. The elected king then went on to be crowned by the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt;. The prince-electors were:\nSubsequent changes.\nLater additions to the electoral council were:"
