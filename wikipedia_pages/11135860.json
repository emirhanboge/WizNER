    "text": "Gura Teghii is a commune in &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u%20County\"&gt;Buz\u0103u County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muntenia\"&gt;Muntenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, located in the north-westernmost part of the county in its mountain region, near the limit of &lt;a href=\"Covasna%20County\"&gt;Covasna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vrancea%20County\"&gt;Vrancea&lt;/a&gt; counties, in the &lt;a href=\"Carpathians\"&gt;Curvature Carpathians&lt;/a&gt;. Gura Teghii made up of seven mountain villages (Furtune\u0219ti, Gura Teghii, Nemertea, P\u0103ltini\u0219, Secuiu, Vadu Oii, Varlaam) on the valley of the river &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2sca%20Roziliei\"&gt;B\u00e2sca Roziliei&lt;/a&gt; and of its tributaries, &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2sca%20Mic%C4%83\"&gt;B\u00e2sca Mic\u0103&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2sca%20Mare\"&gt;B\u00e2sca Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nMentioned in documents starting with the 16th century, these settlements were founded by the &lt;a href=\"Yeoman\"&gt;yeomen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Col%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Sibiciu&lt;/a&gt; area, who had owned those lands before they were taken over by wealthy &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt; landowners. The locals have kept their old &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;n traditions with Transylvanian influences well into the modern era. At first, they bred cattle, then they became &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20%28profession%29\"&gt;cooper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"carpenter\"&gt;carpenter&lt;/a&gt;s passing their trade from generation to generation, while mostly illiterate. The first schools in the commune appeared towards the end of the 19th century, when a major &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; was opened in nearby &lt;a href=\"Nehoiu\"&gt;Nehoiu&lt;/a&gt;. Skilled workers from Gura Teghii were hired in the lumber mill. While some landowners attempted to start businesses in tourism, but during the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Romania\"&gt;Communist era&lt;/a&gt;, this activity went into decline, being revigorated nowadays only by a few &lt;a href=\"bed%20and%20breakfast\"&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGeography.\nThe commune is the northernmost in Buz\u0103u county and occupies most of the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2sca\"&gt;B\u00e2sca&lt;/a&gt; basin, and the basin of its tributary &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2sca%20Mic%C4%83\"&gt;B\u00e2sca Mic\u0103&lt;/a&gt;. The permanently inhabited regions are those in the southern low areas, whereas the commune territory extends into the mountains, covering the &lt;a href=\"Penteleu\"&gt;Penteleu Massif&lt;/a&gt;, with a maximum altitude of . Into the north-west, the communes limits are high on the B\u00e2sca Mare valley, near the &lt;a href=\"Sz%C3%A9kelys\"&gt;Szekler&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Comand%C4%83u\"&gt;Comand\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe oldest document mentioning a village of this commune refers to P\u0103ltini\u0219, and dates back to 11 December 1534; it is a document from the chancellary of hospodar &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Vintil%C4%83%20de%20la%20Slatina\"&gt;Vlad VII Vintil\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, and also mentions the Tega brook, and a shipment of merchandise from the villages in the &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u%20%28river%29\"&gt;Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; river valley towards &lt;a href=\"Bra%C8%99ov\"&gt;Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, the villages in the area were yeomen villages. The locals were working as lumberjacks and carpenters or hunters. In 1672, hospodar &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Leon\"&gt;Radu Leon&lt;/a&gt; granted the land to the yeomen of &lt;a href=\"Col%C8%9Bi\"&gt;Sibiciu&lt;/a&gt;. They took it as a common ownership and used it for shepherding, as in that area grasslands were insufficient. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncoveanu\"&gt;Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu&lt;/a&gt; (late 17th, early 18th century), the ownership of the Buz\u0103u mountains was clearly established: five people were owning the land up until the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s border. One of the owners was Costache Sibiceanu, former yeoman who became a boyar. During the phanariote period, a Wallachian of Greek origin, by the name of Enache Persescu, acquired the lands of the local peasants who could not prove their inheritance. In the meantime, they became serfs on the B\u00e2sca-Gura Teghii estate, so they could not raise cattle, so they took on coopery, selling barrels and casks in the &lt;a href=\"Buz%C4%83u\"&gt;Buz\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mizil\"&gt;Mizil&lt;/a&gt; market towns; the traditional trade was kept until the 1940s, but became lost due to industrialization\u2014many locals were hired at the \"G\u00f6etz\" lumber mills in &lt;a href=\"Nehoiu\"&gt;Nehoiu&lt;/a&gt;."
