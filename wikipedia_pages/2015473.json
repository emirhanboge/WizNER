It is an administrative center of &lt;a href=\"Razgrad%20Province\"&gt;Razgrad Province&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe suffix \"grad\" means city in &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20language\"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt;, while the origin and the meaning of the first part \"raz\" is obscure. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Second Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, around the present city there was a settlement, mentioned by the names of \"Hrasgrad\", \"Hrazgrad\" and \"Hrizgrad\"'. These names come from the name of the &lt;a href=\"Bulgars\"&gt;Bulgar&lt;/a&gt; and Slavic god &lt;a href=\"Hors%20%28deity%29\"&gt;Hors&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRazgrad was built upon the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Ancient Roman&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Abritus\"&gt;Abritus&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%28%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%29\"&gt;Beli Lom&lt;/a&gt; river. Abritus was built on a &lt;a href=\"Thracians\"&gt;Thracian&lt;/a&gt; settlement of the 4th-5th century BC of unknown name. Several bronze coins of the Thracian king &lt;a href=\"Seuthes%20III\"&gt;Seuthes III&lt;/a&gt; (330-300 BC) and pottery were found, as well as artifacts from other rulers and a sacrificial altar of &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of Razgrad's landmarks include the Varosha architectural complex from the 19th century, the ethnographic museum and several other museums, the characteristic &lt;a href=\"clock%20tower\"&gt;clock tower&lt;/a&gt; in the centre built in 1864, the &lt;a href=\"St%20Nicholas\"&gt;St Nicholas&lt;/a&gt; the Miracle Worker Church from 1860, the \"Momina cheshma\" sculpture, the Mausoleum Ossuary of the Liberators (1879\u20131880) and the &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Pasha%20Mosque\"&gt;Ibrahim Pasha Mosque&lt;/a&gt; from 1530. The mosque is said to be one of the largest in the Balkans.\nIn 251, the town was the site of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Abrittus\"&gt;Battle of Abrittus&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt; defeated a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; army under the emperors &lt;a href=\"Trajan%20Decius\"&gt;Trajan Decius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herennius%20Etruscus\"&gt;Herennius Etruscus&lt;/a&gt;. The battle is notable for being the first occasion of a Roman emperor being killed in a battle with barbarians.\n&lt;a href=\"Razgrad%20Peak\"&gt;Razgrad Peak&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%20Island\"&gt;Greenwich Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Shetland%20Islands\"&gt;South Shetland Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; is named after Razgrad.\nPopulation.\nIn January 2012, Razgrad was inhabited by 33,416 people within the city limits, while the &lt;a href=\"Razgrad%20Municipality\"&gt;Razgrad Municipality&lt;/a&gt; with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 50,457 inhabitants.
