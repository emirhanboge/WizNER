    "text": "The 2004 French Open was the 108th edition of the tournament. &lt;a href=\"Gast%C3%B3n%20Gaudio\"&gt;Gast\u00f3n Gaudio&lt;/a&gt; became the first men's &lt;a href=\"Open%20Era\"&gt;Open Era&lt;/a&gt; Grand Slam title winner to save two match points in the final; the last time that had happened was 70 years earlier. Gaudio also became the first &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; man since &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Vilas\"&gt;Guillermo Vilas&lt;/a&gt; to win a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt;, in 1979. Fellow Argentine &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Coria\"&gt;Guillermo Coria&lt;/a&gt;, widely regarded as the favourite and best &lt;a href=\"clay%20court\"&gt;clay court&lt;/a&gt; player in the world coming into the tournament, was seeded 3rd for the event, whereas Gaudio was unseeded (ranked 44th) and with only two titles to his name, both of which he had won over two years before. After winning the first two sets convincingly, Coria began suffering from leg &lt;a href=\"cramp\"&gt;cramp&lt;/a&gt;s. Gaudio won the next two sets; however, Coria came back and was up two breaks of serve in the final set. Coria had two match points at 6\u20135 before Gaudio prevailed 0\u20136, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20131, 8\u20136. Gaudio also became the first man to win a Grand Slam tournament final after being &lt;a href=\"bagel%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;bagelled&lt;/a&gt; in the first set. The tournament was noted for the excellent performance of the Argentine players \u2013 in addition to the two finalists, there were a semifinalist (&lt;a href=\"David%20Nalbandian\"&gt;David Nalbandian&lt;/a&gt;) and a quarterfinalist (&lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ignacio%20Chela\"&gt;Juan Ignacio Chela&lt;/a&gt;). It was also highlighted by a first round match between &lt;a href=\"Fabrice%20Santoro\"&gt;Fabrice Santoro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arnaud%20Cl%C3%A9ment\"&gt;Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment&lt;/a&gt;, lasting 6 hours and 33 minutes and ending in Clement's defeat 6\u20134, 6\u20133, 6\u20137, 3\u20136, 16\u201314, setting a new record for the longest singles match in the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20tennis%23Open%20era\"&gt;open era&lt;/a&gt;, which would stand until &lt;a href=\"Isner%26amp%3Bndash%3BMahut%20match%20at%20the%202010%20Wimbledon%20Championships\"&gt;Wimbledon 2010&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the last Grand Slam tournament to feature neither &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Federer\"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Nadal\"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-finals until the &lt;a href=\"2012%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;2012 US Open&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the women's draw, &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Myskina\"&gt;Anastasia Myskina&lt;/a&gt; became first Russian female tennis player to win a Grand Slam title. The next two Grand Slams were also won by Russian women (&lt;a href=\"Maria%20Sharapova\"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"2004%20Wimbledon%20Championships\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Svetlana%20Kuznetsova\"&gt;Svetlana Kuznetsova&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2004%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt;). She also became the first French Open women's title winner after having saved a match point en route to the title (against Svetlana Kuznetsova in the 4th round).\nIn the mixed doubles, French players &lt;a href=\"Tatiana%20Golovin\"&gt;Tatiana Golovin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gasquet\"&gt;Richard Gasquet&lt;/a&gt; (aged 16 and 17 respectively) won the tournament after entering as &lt;a href=\"Wild%20card%20%28sports%29\"&gt;wildcard&lt;/a&gt;s. France also saw success in the boys' singles, where &lt;a href=\"Ga%C3%ABl%20Monfils\"&gt;Ga\u00ebl Monfils&lt;/a&gt; won.\n&lt;a href=\"Juan%20Carlos%20Ferrero\"&gt;Juan Carlos Ferrero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Justine%20Henin\"&gt;Justine Henin-Hardenne&lt;/a&gt; were both unsuccessful in defending their 2003 titles; both being eliminated in the second round. It would be the last time until the &lt;a href=\"2009%20French%20Open\"&gt;2009 French Open&lt;/a&gt; that both defending champions were defeated in the same round. In Henin's case, her early exit would be the last time a top seed lost within the first two rounds of any Grand Slam until &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Ivanovic\"&gt;Ana Ivanovic&lt;/a&gt; lost in the second round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;2008 US Open&lt;/a&gt;. Henin's loss to &lt;a href=\"Tathiana%20Garbin\"&gt;Tathiana Garbin&lt;/a&gt; in the second round was her only defeat at the tournament between &lt;a href=\"2003%20French%20Open\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2009%20French%20Open\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; (she did not play in 2008 and 2009).\nThis was the last Grand Slam where two first time singles players (both men's and women's) won in the first major titles.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow are the tables with the point distribution for each discipline of the tournament.\nChampions.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n &lt;a href=\"Gast%C3%B3n%20Gaudio\"&gt;Gast\u00f3n Gaudio&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Coria\"&gt;Guillermo Coria&lt;/a&gt;, 0\u20136, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20131, 8\u20136\nWomen's singles.\n &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Myskina\"&gt;Anastasia Myskina&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Dementieva\"&gt;Elena Dementieva&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20131, 6\u20132 \nMen's doubles.\n &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20Malisse\"&gt;Xavier Malisse&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Olivier%20Rochus\"&gt;Olivier Rochus&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Micha%C3%ABl%20Llodra\"&gt;Micha\u00ebl Llodra&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Fabrice%20Santoro\"&gt;Fabrice Santoro&lt;/a&gt;, 7\u20135, 7\u20135\nWomen's doubles.\n &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Ruano%20Pascual\"&gt;Virginia Ruano Pascual&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Paola%20Su%C3%A1rez\"&gt;Paola Su\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Svetlana%20Kuznetsova\"&gt;Svetlana Kuznetsova&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Likhovtseva\"&gt;Elena Likhovtseva&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20130, 6\u20133\nMixed doubles.\n &lt;a href=\"Tatiana%20Golovin\"&gt;Tatiana Golovin&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gasquet\"&gt;Richard Gasquet&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Cara%20Black\"&gt;Cara Black&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Black\"&gt;Wayne Black&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20133, 6\u20134\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n &lt;a href=\"Ga%C3%ABl%20Monfils\"&gt;Ga\u00ebl Monfils&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Kuznetsov\"&gt;Alex Kuznetsov&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20132, 6\u20132\nGirls' singles.\n &lt;a href=\"Sesil%20Karatantcheva\"&gt;Sesil Karatantcheva&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"M%C4%83d%C4%83lina%20Gojnea\"&gt;M\u0103d\u0103lina Gojnea&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20134, 6\u20130\nBoys' doubles.\n &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20And%C3%BAjar\"&gt;Pablo And\u00fajar&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Granollers\"&gt;Marcel Granollers&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Kuznetsov\"&gt;Alex Kuznetsov&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Mischa%20Zverev\"&gt;Mischa Zverev&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20133, 6\u20132\nGirls' doubles.\n &lt;a href=\"Kate%C5%99ina%20B%C3%B6hmov%C3%A1%20%281986%29\"&gt;Kate\u0159ina B\u00f6hmov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Micha%C3%ABlla%20Krajicek\"&gt;Micha\u00eblla Krajicek&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Irina%20Kotkina\"&gt;Irina Kotkina&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Yaroslava%20Shvedova\"&gt;Yaroslava Shvedova&lt;/a&gt;, 6\u20133, 6\u20132\nWildcard entries.\nBelow are the lists of the &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20terminology%23W\"&gt;wildcard&lt;/a&gt; awardees entering in the main draws."
