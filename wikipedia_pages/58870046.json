    "text": "Portrait of a Knight of Malta is a c.1515 oil on canvas painting by &lt;a href=\"Titian\"&gt;Titian&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Hospitaller\"&gt;Order of Malta&lt;/a&gt;. It is now in the &lt;a href=\"Uffizi\"&gt;Uffizi&lt;/a&gt; in Florence. The last bead of the &lt;a href=\"rosary\"&gt;rosary&lt;/a&gt; held by the knight bears the number XXXV (35), showing the subject's age at the time of the portrait. W.F. Dickes. argued that he was &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Colonna%20di%20Palestrina\"&gt;Stefano Colonna&lt;/a&gt;, the condottiero who led the republican resistance during the siege of Florence. cited in \nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20del%20Sera\"&gt;Paolo del Sera&lt;/a&gt;, his agent in Venice, cardinal &lt;a href=\"Leopoldo%20de%27%20Medici\"&gt;Leopoldo de' Medici&lt;/a&gt; acquired several works by the Venetian school for his collection, which later became part of the Uffizi. \"Portrait\" was one of these works, costing 300 &lt;a href=\"piastre\"&gt;piastre&lt;/a&gt;s, showing it was already considered to be an autograph work. It was exhibited in the &lt;a href=\"Tribuna%20%28Uffizi%29\"&gt;Tribuna&lt;/a&gt; in 1677 and attributed to &lt;a href=\"Giorgione\"&gt;Giorgione&lt;/a&gt; in 1709, as shown on a label on the back of the painting. It was then moved to the &lt;a href=\"villa%20di%20Poggio%20a%20Caiano\"&gt;villa di Poggio a Caiano&lt;/a&gt;. After several subsequent moves, in &lt;a href=\"1798\"&gt;1798&lt;/a&gt; it finally arrived back Uffizi.\nOxidisation in the paint in the 19th century made attribution difficult. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Archer%20Crowe\"&gt;Joseph Archer Crowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cavalcaselle\"&gt;Cavalcaselle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Morelli%20%28art%20historian%29\"&gt;Giovanni Morelli&lt;/a&gt; could not decide on the work's artist, Otto M\u00fcndler (1869) argued it was by &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20della%20Vecchia\"&gt;Pietro della Vecchia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Longhi\"&gt;Roberto Longhi&lt;/a&gt; that it was by &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Bordone\"&gt;Paris Bordone&lt;/a&gt; - other critics shifted between &lt;a href=\"Giorgione\"&gt;Giorgione&lt;/a&gt; and Titian as the artist. Stefano Scarpelli restored it in 1998, enabling it to be identified as an early Titian still with heavy influences from Giorgione."
