    "text": "The Ryeland is one of the oldest &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; breeds going back seven centuries when the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Leominster\"&gt;Leominster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Herefordshire\"&gt;Herefordshire&lt;/a&gt; bred sheep and grazed them on the &lt;a href=\"rye\"&gt;rye&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s, giving them their name. It was introduced into &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1919 and are classified as an &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; breed by the &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Breeds%20Trust%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Rare Breeds Trust of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and also are one of the nine heritage breeds that were the foundation of the sheep and wool industry in Australia. The Ryeland was one of the breeds used to introduce the &lt;a href=\"Polled%20livestock\"&gt;poll gene&lt;/a&gt; (no horns) to the &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20%28sheep%29\"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt; breed in the development of the &lt;a href=\"Poll%20Dorset\"&gt;Poll Dorset&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis breed is raised primarily for &lt;a href=\"Lamb%20and%20mutton\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreed characteristics.\nRyelands are docile with high &lt;a href=\"fertility\"&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their blocky build they are easy on fences compared to many breeds. They are ideal sheep for small properties. Ryelands are also 'good -doers' \u2013 &lt;a href=\"William%20Youatt\"&gt;William Youatt&lt;/a&gt; wrote that Ryelands \"endure privation of food better than any other breed\" and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Joseph%20Banks\"&gt;Sir Joseph Banks&lt;/a&gt; wrote \"Ryelands deserve a niche in the temple of famine\".\nRyelands have a smaller head than most terminal sires which makes them a good choice for maiden or &lt;a href=\"Merino\"&gt;Merino&lt;/a&gt; ewes but they have a fast growth rate and early maturity. In Australia the wool is always white and free of &lt;a href=\"kemp%20%28wool%29\"&gt;kemp&lt;/a&gt;. \nA coloured gene does occur in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; but appears to be unknown in Australia. The &lt;a href=\"hoof\"&gt;hooves&lt;/a&gt; are black and they are said to have good resistance to footrot. Naturally hornless, the Ryeland was the major breed used in the development of the poll gene in the &lt;a href=\"Poll%20Dorset\"&gt;Poll Dorset&lt;/a&gt; in Australia.\nThe wool resists felting. The staple length is generally 8 cm to 10 cm, with a fibre diameter of 25 to 28 &lt;a href=\"Wool%20measurement\"&gt;microns&lt;/a&gt;. The fleece on average weighs 2 kg to 3 kg.\nQueen Elizabeth I's favourite stockings.\nThey were considered to have the finest &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; of all British breeds of the time. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; was given 'Lemster' wool &lt;a href=\"stocking\"&gt;stocking&lt;/a&gt;s and liked them so much that from then on she insisted only on 'Lemster' Ryeland wool. An Elizabethan observer wrote that 'among short-wools, Ryeland has pre-eminence with Leominster as the centre of its trade'.\nThe Ryeland is featured in &lt;a href=\"David%20Low%20%28agriculturalist%29\"&gt;David Low&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"The Breeds of the Domestic Animals of the British Islands\", published 1841 and a famous pioneering work illustrating the forerunners of all of the days' most important breeds of horses, cows, sheep and pigs. David Low was a professor of &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; and was concerned that the relatively simple basic concepts of matching a breed to its environment whilst improving its productivity were not understood by the majority of farmers or breeders. With the help of a government grant from &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Spencer%20%28peerage%29\"&gt;Earl Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, Low set up the agricultural museum in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; and commissioned &lt;a href=\"William%20Shiels\"&gt;William Shiels&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Scottish%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Scottish Academy&lt;/a&gt; to produce these beautiful paintings of all the significant breeds of economic significance in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; at that time."
