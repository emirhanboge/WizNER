    "text": "Miami ( ) is a city in and &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Ottawa County, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, United States, founded in 1891. &lt;a href=\"Lead\"&gt;Lead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; mining established by 1918, caused it to boom.\nThis area was part of &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;. Miami is the capital of the federally recognized &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Miami Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, after which it is named; the &lt;a href=\"Modoc%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Peoria%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Peoria Tribe of Indians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shawnee%20Tribe\"&gt;Shawnee Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;, the population was 12,969.\nHistory.\nMiami began in an unusual way, compared to other towns in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;. Per the \"Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\" \"... it was settled in a business-like way by men of vision who looked into the future and saw possibilities. It didn't just grow. It was carefully planned.\"\nW. C. Lykins petitioned the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass legislation on March 3, 1891, to establish the town. He met with Thomas F. Richardville, chief of the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Miami Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to meet in turn with the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Commission\"&gt;U.S. Indian Commission&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Ottawa Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. \nThat meeting resulted in Congress authorizing the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;secretary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;United States Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; to approve the townsite purchase from the Ottawa. Lykins, Richardville and Manford Pooler, chief of the Ottawa, are identified in historical accounts as \"fathers of Miami.\" Lykins' company, the Miami Town Company, bought of land from the Ottawa for ten dollars an acre. On June 25\u201326, 1891 they held an auction of lots. In 1895, Miami incorporated and had more than 800 residents.\nThe discovery of rich deposits of lead and zinc under &lt;a href=\"Quapaw\"&gt;Quapaw&lt;/a&gt; land a few miles north caused Miami to boom. In 1907, at the time of statehood, its population was 1,893. As mining increased and more mills were built, the population increased to 6,802 by 1920.\nMiami was on the route of the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Highway\"&gt;Jefferson Highway&lt;/a&gt; established in 1915, with that international road running more than from &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg\"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;, Manitoba in Canada across the border and to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana. &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2066%20in%20Oklahoma\"&gt;US Route 66&lt;/a&gt; in Oklahoma also passed through Miami. An historic &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2066%20in%20Oklahoma%23Structures\"&gt;section of the Route 66 roadbed&lt;/a&gt; is marked in Miami.\nIt is the capital of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, after which it is named; the &lt;a href=\"Modoc%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, &lt;a href=\"Peoria%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Peoria Tribe of Indians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shawnee%20Tribe\"&gt;Shawnee Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nMiami is located near (36.883539, \u221294.876018). According to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.82%) is water.\nFlooding.\nMiami is located on the &lt;a href=\"Neosho%20River\"&gt;Neosho River&lt;/a&gt;, and was severely affected by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Flood%20of%201951\"&gt;Great Flood of 1951&lt;/a&gt;. The town has flooded more than two dozen times since the 1990s, most recently during the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Arkansas%20River%20floods\"&gt;2019 Arkansas River floods&lt;/a&gt;. Town residents and neighboring Native American groups have objected to maintaining high water levels on the river at &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%20Dam\"&gt;Pensacola Dam&lt;/a&gt; and its popular vacation area, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lake%20o%27%20the%20Cherokees\"&gt;Grand Lake&lt;/a&gt;, on the grounds that when water backs up downstream, it can increase Miami's flooding problems.\nDemographics.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 13,570 people, 5,315 households, and 3,337 families residing in the city. a one percent decline from 13,704 at the 2000 census.

These counties combined make up the third-largest tourism destination in the state, following only the &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20City\"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tulsa\"&gt;Tulsa&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan areas.\nMiami is home to the historic Coleman Theatre, located at 103 N. Main St. On April 18, 1929, the 1,600-seat Coleman Theatre enjoyed a grand opening as a luxurious movie theater of the time. Designed by the &lt;a href=\"Boller%20Bros.\"&gt;Boller Bros.&lt;/a&gt;, and built by George L. Coleman Sr. at a cost of $600,000, the Louis XV interior includes &lt;a href=\"gold%20leaf\"&gt;gold leaf&lt;/a&gt; trim, silk &lt;a href=\"damask\"&gt;damask&lt;/a&gt; panels, &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; panels, marble accents, a carved &lt;a href=\"mahogany\"&gt;mahogany&lt;/a&gt; staircase, &lt;a href=\"Wurlitzer\"&gt;Wurlitzer&lt;/a&gt; pipe organ, decorative plaster moldings, and bronze railings. While there have been many changes to seeing movies in grand theaters, the building has been preserved and also serves as a venue for live performances. In 1959 a local non-profit community group established the Miami Little Theatre. The community theater group presents five large-scale productions on the Coleman stage every year. In 1983, the Coleman Theatre was placed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20Ottawa%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;National Register of Historical Places for Ottawa County&lt;/a&gt;. \nOther Miami structures are also listed on the National Register of Historical Places, including the &lt;a href=\"George%20L.%20Coleman%20Sr.%20House\"&gt;George L.
