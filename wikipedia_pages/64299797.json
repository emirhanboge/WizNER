    "text": "The Hanomag L 28 was a light truck from the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Hanomag\"&gt;Hanomag&lt;/a&gt; that released in 1950. The vehicle was the first newly developed &lt;a href=\"commercial%20vehicle\"&gt;commercial vehicle&lt;/a&gt; from Hanomag after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the large vans and light trucks division.\nIt was designed as a modern long hood and had a so-called \u201calligator hood\u201d based on &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; models and headlights integrated into the front of the vehicle (i.e. no longer free-standing), which gave the vehicle a modern appearance at the time. A short time later, the two competition models &lt;a href=\"Opel%20Blitz\"&gt;Opel Blitz&lt;/a&gt; (1952) and &lt;a href=\"Borgward\"&gt;Borgward&lt;/a&gt; B 1500 (1954) also had a similar appearance. The L 28 was initially designed for 1\u00bd tons of payload, over time other versions for 2, 2\u00bd and 3 tons of payload appeared, in 1956 a 1.75-tonner appeared instead of the 1\u00bd and 2-ton versions. The entire model range was driven by Hanomag &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s initially with 50 &lt;a href=\"Horsepower\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, for the larger models there were later also diesel engines with 65 and 70 HP. Popular versions were the platform truck, the closed panel van and the separate box body, and a &lt;a href=\"minibus\"&gt;minibus&lt;/a&gt; variant was also available with bodies from bodybuilders.\nThe water-cooled &lt;a href=\"Straight-four%20engine\"&gt;inline four-cylinder&lt;/a&gt;, four-stroke diesel engine with 2.8 L displacement of the Hanomag L 28 was equipped in 1953 with a Roots &lt;a href=\"turbocharger\"&gt;turbocharger&lt;/a&gt;, which was driven by a &lt;a href=\"Belt%20%28mechanical%29\"&gt;V-belt&lt;/a&gt;. The sound of the Hanomag D-28 engines was characterized by the particularly striking \"diesel nailing\" and the \"singing\" of the blower.\nIn 1955 the L-28 cab received front hinged doors instead of the previously used rear hinged door and in recent years instead of the two small ones, a large curved panoramic windshield, which made the cab look much more modern. Between 1958 and 1960, the L 28 series was gradually replaced by the Hanomag Kurier, Garant and Markant front-link successor series, differently labeled according to their weight.\nDesign.\nThe type A-L 28 was built in the versions with 1\u00bd t and 2\u00bd t payload, as civil version A-L 28 Z and as &lt;a href=\"all-wheel%20drive\"&gt;all-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; group car. Between 1953 and 1971 about 6,000 copies were made. The production peak was reached in 1963 with 1,657 vehicles.\nThe A-L 28 received the 2.8-liter diesel engine of the 3-ton L-28 model with an output of 70\u00a0hp (51\u00a0kW) at 2800 rpm. The vehicles had a ZF four-speed gearbox (AKS-25) with countershaft and simultaneous engagement of the &lt;a href=\"Front-wheel%20drive\"&gt;front wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; (1: 1.18 / 1: 2.138). The second and third gear were synchronized. With an empty weight of 3860\u00a0kg, the top speed was 72\u00a0km / h, the climbing ability 69%. Most recently, the vehicles were equipped with a hydraulically operated dual-circuit brake with compressed air support. One brake circuit worked on the front &lt;a href=\"axle\"&gt;axle&lt;/a&gt;, the other behind. The vehicle was either fitted with single tires at the front and rear (versions A and A 1) or with twin tires (A 2) at the rear.\nOn April 1, 1969, the commercial vehicle divisions of Hanomag and &lt;a href=\"Henschel%20%26amp%3B%20Son\"&gt;Henschel-Werke&lt;/a&gt; merged to form Hanomag-Henschel Fahrzeugwerke GmbH (HHF) within the Rheinstahl group. &lt;a href=\"Daimler%20AG\"&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/a&gt; initially acquired 51% of this company and the rest of the share capital at the end of 1970. The last A-L 28 were produced under the company name Hanomag-Henschel, in 1974 the Hanomag-Henschel brand disappeared from the truck market.\nExternal links.\nInternet Archive) Mit historischem Werbebild 1, Mit historischem Werbebild 2 (archiviert).
