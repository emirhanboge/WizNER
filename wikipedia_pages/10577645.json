    "text": "The Royal Guard () is an independent &lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Spanish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; that is dedicated to the protection of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Spain\"&gt;King of Spain&lt;/a&gt; and members of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Spanish Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;. It currently has a strength of 1,500 troops. While the guard does participate in parades and other ceremonial events, it is a fully functional combat unit. Its members are recruited from the ranks of all three branches of the Spanish Armed Forces and receive the same combat training as regular soldiers.\nThe guard contains a diverse mix of units: a &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Marine%20Infantry\"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt; company from the Navy, a paratroop company from the Air Force and an infantry company from the Army, among others. Some units served in recent times in Afghanistan and Bosnia.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Royal Guard dates back to &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval times&lt;/a&gt;. The senior unit and one of the oldest body guards in the world is the Corps of Gentlemen of the Chamber, the \"&lt;a href=\"Monteros%20de%20Espinosa\"&gt;Monteros de Espinosa&lt;/a&gt;\", dating to 1006 and created by &lt;a href=\"Sancho%20Garc%C3%ADa%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Sancho Garcia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile\"&gt;House of Castile&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven before the time of the first monarch of Spain, the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Monarchs\"&gt;Catholic Monarchs&lt;/a&gt; formed the group called the \"Guardias Viejas de Castilla\" (\"Old Guards of &lt;a href=\"Castile%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Castile&lt;/a&gt;\"). Later on, the first monarch of Spain, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt; ordered that a company of those guards to reside and continuously stand guard in his palace, denominating it \"Los Cien Continos\" (\"The Continuous Hundred\").\nOfficial formation.\nLater on, Charles V's father, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Philip the Handsome&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Spain in 1502 brought with him his \"Guardia Borgo\u00f1ona\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Burgundian%20Guard\"&gt;Burgundian Guard&lt;/a&gt;s\"). They were also called the \"Guardia de los Archeros\" (aka \"Guardia de Cuchilla\" &gt; \"Guards of the Blade\") because they were armed with a &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;-type polearm called an \"archa\", not because they were archers (\"arqueros\"). Their purpose was to secure the royal household by standing guard or patrolling the grounds on horseback. These group of Royal Guards with their Burgundian style, together with two units of \"alabarderos\" (\"halberdiers\"), will remain in service until the reorganization of the \"Troops of the Royal Household\" (\"Tropas de Casa Real\") by &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip V&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, the royal guards were organized into:\nIn the 19th century the guards were reinforced by the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Marine%20Infantry\"&gt;Spanish Marine Infantry&lt;/a&gt;, which formed its own unit.\nIn 1824-25 the Guard was expanded into a full independent army group reporting to the sovereign and the Royal Military Household with two full corps following the example of France's Napoleonic Imperial Guard and Borbon Restorationist Royal Guards:\nIn the 1840s only the internal units of the Royal Guards remained as the others were disbanded or transferred to the regular Army. In 1868 the Halberdiers stood down, only to be reformed under King Amadeo I as the Royal Guard Battalion of one infantry company and one cavalry troop and revived as a full battalion under his successor Alfonso XII.\nCivil War.\nThe guards were disbanded in 1931 as a result of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Spanish%20Republic\"&gt;2nd Republic&lt;/a&gt; and was replaced by the \"Presidential Horse Guards Squadron\" (\"Escuadr\u00f3n de Escolta Presidencial\"), which was a cavalry formation. By 1936, it included the infantry \"Presidential Guards Battalion\" (\"batall\u00f3n de Guardia Presidencial\"), which remained loyal to the Republic during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;.\nRestoration.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;, By Decree of February 4, 1949, the Military House of the Generalissimo was reorganized and on the basis of the republican formations the \"Regiment of the Guards of His Excellency the Head of State\" (\"Regimiento de la Guardia de Su Excelencia el Jefe del Estado\"), later on the \"Guards Regiment of HE the Generalissimo\" (\"Regimiento de la Guardia de S.E. el General\u00edsimo\"), was activated, which included a mounted squadron (the \"&lt;a href=\"Guardia%20Mora\"&gt;Guardia Mora&lt;/a&gt;\") which was first raised from surplus personnel of the &lt;a href=\"Regulares\"&gt;Regulares&lt;/a&gt;. After several reorganizations, the unit would last until Franco's death as a combined arms guard regiment.\nUpon Franco\u2019s death &amp; the ascension of King &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Carlos\"&gt;Juan Carlos&lt;/a&gt; as the head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces, the guard regiment was integrated into the new army under the king &amp; formed the basis of what is now the modern day Guardia Real - the \"Royal Guards Regiment\" (\"Regimento de la Guardia Real\"), which is responsible to the king thru the Ministry of Defense. In the 1980s it grew into a three-battalion regiment. Today it is a four battalion unit that serves as the protocol and security service of the Spanish Royal Family.\nRole.\nThe primary function of the Royal guard is to provide military security for the Monarchy. In addition to protecting members of Spanish Royal Family, the present functions of the unit include the protection of foreign heads of state visiting &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and of royal palaces such as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%20of%20Madrid\"&gt;Royal Palace of Madrid&lt;/a&gt; (\"Palacio Real\"), the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%20of%20El%20Pardo\"&gt;Palace of El Pardo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Zarzuela\"&gt;Palace of Zarzuela&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe regiment is an active combat unit and has been deployed to &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The guard regularly takes part in military exercises organized in conjunction with all three of the main branches of Spains military.\nIt is involved in the guard mounting ceremony (Cambio de la Guardia) at the Royal Palace on the first Wednesday of every month from 12 midday to 2pm (save for July, August and September). It is present at &lt;a href=\"military%20parades\"&gt;military parades&lt;/a&gt; in the national capital of &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Public%20holidays%20in%20Spain\"&gt;official holidays&lt;/a&gt; including \"&lt;a href=\"Fiesta%20Nacional%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20Day\"&gt;\"D\u00eda de la Constituci\u00f3n\"&lt;/a&gt;. Annually, it has a troop review during the \"&lt;a href=\"Pascua%20Militar\"&gt;Pascua Militar&lt;/a&gt;\" ceremony on 6 January."
