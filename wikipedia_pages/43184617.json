    "text": "The Social Democratic Party of Macedonia (, \"Socijal-demokratska partija na Makedonija\", SDPM) is a political party in &lt;a href=\"North%20Macedonia\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1990, the SDPM was the first political party to register in Macedonia, with &lt;a href=\"Slavko%20Milosavlevski\"&gt;Slavko Milosavlevski&lt;/a&gt; becoming its founding president. It contested the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1990 parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when Macedonia was still part of &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. It received 1.6% of the vote in the first round and 0.2 in the second, failing to win a seat. It also ran in alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Macedonia\"&gt;Union of Reform Forces&lt;/a&gt; in some areas, but the alliance failed to win a seat.\nDespite seeing its vote share fall to 1.2% in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Macedonian%20general%20election\"&gt;1994 elections&lt;/a&gt;, the party managed to win a single seat in the &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia\"&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe SDPM did not contest the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1998 elections&lt;/a&gt;, but returned to run in the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2002 elections&lt;/a&gt;. However, the party received just 0.3% of the vote and failed to win a seat. The &lt;a href=\"2006%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2006 elections&lt;/a&gt; saw the party increase its vote share to 0.9%, but it remained seatless. In the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2008 elections&lt;/a&gt; its vote share fell to 0.65%, as the party again failed to win a seat. In the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Macedonian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2011 elections&lt;/a&gt; the party's vote share fell to just 0.2%. The &lt;a href=\"2014%20Macedonian%20general%20election\"&gt;2014 elections&lt;/a&gt; saw it receive 0.4% of the vote, but it remained seatless."
