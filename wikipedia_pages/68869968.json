It has a simulated &lt;a href=\"lapstrake\"&gt;lapstrake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"canoe\"&gt;canoe&lt;/a&gt; hull, a spooned &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, an angled &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a keel-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed modified long &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, with a cutaway forefoot. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel.\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese &lt;a href=\"Yanmar\"&gt;Yanmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double &lt;a href=\"%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B-berth\"&gt;\"V\"-berth&lt;/a&gt; in the bow cabin, a straight settee and a drop-down dinette table that converts to a berth in the main cabin. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the starboard side just forward of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. The galley is equipped with a two-burner stove and a sink. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"this double-ender is reminiscent of a miniaturized version of the Scandinavian redningskoites of yore, and the mid-1920s derivative designs of Colin Archer and William ('Billy') Atkin. She is the first design Henry Mohrschladt drew for his new company, Pacific Seacraft, of which he was president ... Production of the 25 lasted only five years. Distinguishing characteristics include her lapstrake hull construction and her relatively tiny sailplan (SA/D is only 12.8; values below 16 are considered very low). Best features: We like her accommodations plan, perfect for one or two voyaging sailors. We enjoyed a similar arrangement in our Tartan 27. Worst features: Like her comp[etitor], the &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20Crabber%2024\"&gt;Cornish Crabber&lt;/a&gt;, the PS 25 lacks sufficient sail area to make her go well in light air. Because of her narrow ends and low freeboard, she also has a lower Space Index than any of her comp[etitor]s.\"\nA review in \"Blue Water Boats\" described the design, \"by modern standards the little 25-footer is considered quite slow, but to make up for this she is immensely strong and seaworthy, low maintenance, and perfectly capable of being trailered to a cruising ground of your choice. It's been said the Pacific Seacraft 25 looks much like a blend between fishing vessel and a ship's lifeboat encapsulating a traditional old world feel. Beneath the waterline is a full keel with a forefoot cutaway which blesses her with fine tracking abilities combined with a hefty rudder hung from the double-ender's stern post. The bottom of the keel has a long enough straight section to allow her to sit upright without nosing forwards should she be tied up while the tide is out.\""
