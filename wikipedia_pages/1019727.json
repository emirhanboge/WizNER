    "text": "The BMT West End Line is a line of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Subway\"&gt;New York City Subway&lt;/a&gt;, serving the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; communities of &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Park%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Sunset Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borough%20Park%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Borough Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Utrecht\"&gt;New Utrecht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bensonhurst\"&gt;Bensonhurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Beach%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Bath Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coney%20Island\"&gt;Coney Island&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"D%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; train operates local on the entire line at all times. Although there is a center express track and three express stations along the line, there is no regular express service.\nThe elevated line, originally mapped as the New Utrecht Avenue Line (though the common name prevailed after construction), replaced the surface &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20Line%20%28Brooklyn%20surface%29\"&gt;West End Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtent and service.\nThe following services use part or all of the BMT West End Line:\nThe line begins as a branch of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line south of the 36th Street station, and it extends through a cut described as the 38th Street cut to Ninth Avenue. Then it becomes an elevated structure over New Utrecht Avenue, before subsequently turning through private property near 79th Street into 86th Street. The line then continues over 86th Street to Stillwell Avenue and to the line's terminal at Coney Island.\nHistory.\nThe line was originally a surface excursion railway to &lt;a href=\"Coney%20Island\"&gt;Coney Island&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20Bath%20and%20Coney%20Island%20Railroad\"&gt;Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 1862, but did not reach Coney Island until 1864. Under the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Contracts\"&gt;Dual Contracts&lt;/a&gt; of 1913, an elevated line was built over New Utrecht Avenue, 86th Street and Stillwell Avenue.\nFrom 39th Street to Coney Island, the old route was abandoned as a rapid transit line, and it was turned into a surface car line. Surface car operation began on the line once the new elevated service started.\nThe first portion of the line, between the 36th Street station on Fourth Avenue and 62nd Street station, opened on June 24, 1916 with two tracks. On the same date, the line opened three more stations to 18th Avenue, but with only one track in service. The second track between 62nd Street and 18th Avenue opened on July 8, 1916. The line was then extended to 25th Avenue on July 29, 1916. The line opened to and fully opening to Coney Island on July 21, 1917. The original surface right-of-way was retained for use by trolley cars to provide local service and protect the company's franchise.\nAs part of an 18-month capital budget that took effect on January 1, 1963, the wooden platforms at the stations on the West End Line were replaced with concrete platforms.\nService history.\nThe West End Line has had an express (on the &lt;a href=\"BMT%20Fourth%20Avenue%20Line\"&gt;BMT Fourth Avenue Line&lt;/a&gt;) service \u2013 labeled &lt;a href=\"BMT%203\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 \u2013 since it opened in 1916, passing over the &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%20Bridge\"&gt;Manhattan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and onto the &lt;a href=\"BMT%20Broadway%20Line\"&gt;BMT Broadway Line&lt;/a&gt; express tracks. In the late 1950s, midday trains were switched to the local Fourth Avenue tracks and through the &lt;a href=\"Montague%20Street%20Tunnel\"&gt;Montague Street Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, and late night and Sunday service became a shuttle between Coney Island and &lt;a href=\"36th%20Street%20%28BMT%20Fourth%20Avenue%20Line%29\"&gt;36th Street&lt;/a&gt;. The express and local services were assigned the designations and in the early 1960s. With the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Chrystie%20Street%20Connection\"&gt;Chrystie Street Connection&lt;/a&gt; in late 1967, the train from Manhattan was extended to Coney Island, absorbing the T and TT (both ran express on Fourth Avenue). The TT late night and Sunday shuttle survived until 1968, when the B became full-time. It ran local on Fourth Avenue during late night hours, but express at all other times. Late night operation was cut back to a shuttle to 36th Street in 1976.\nIn 2001, when reconstruction of the &lt;a href=\"Manhattan%20Bridge\"&gt;Manhattan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; north tracks resumed, the B service in Brooklyn was replaced by the new train, which ran as a shuttle not only to 36th Street during nighttime hours, but also to &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Avenue%E2%80%93Barclays%20Center%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%29\"&gt;Atlantic Avenue\u2013Pacific Street&lt;/a&gt; on weekends. In 2002, reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Coney%20Island%E2%80%93Stillwell%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%29\"&gt;Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the West End Line being the only line to serve the terminal and the W was extended full-time into Manhattan, using the local Fourth Avenue tracks and Montague Street Tunnel on weekends and late nights hours.\nIn 2004, the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction project was completed, and the W was replaced with an extended train, running over the bridge at all hours and express on Fourth Avenue except late nights. D service was moved to the West End Line instead of returning to the &lt;a href=\"BMT%20Brighton%20Line\"&gt;Brighton Line&lt;/a&gt;, where it ran on from 1967 to 2001, because West End Line residents from Chinatowns in Brooklyn wanted full-time access to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Street%20%28IND%20Sixth%20Avenue%20Line%29\"&gt;Grand Street&lt;/a&gt;, on the Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan's Chinatown. This also eliminated the need to run late-night and/or weekend shuttles on either the Concourse Line or the West End Line.\nThe other service pattern was the \"West End Short Line\", a rush-hour local (on Fourth Avenue) service between the &lt;a href=\"BMT%20Nassau%20Street%20Line\"&gt;BMT Nassau Street Line&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Manhattan\"&gt;Lower Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"62nd%20Street%20%28BMT%20West%20End%20Line%29\"&gt;62nd Street&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Parkway%20%28BMT%20West%20End%20Line%29\"&gt;Bay Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It became part of the TT in the early 1960s and was discontinued in 1967. In 1987, the short line service was essentially recreated when the rush-hour extension to Brooklyn was moved from the &lt;a href=\"BMT%20Brighton%20Line\"&gt;BMT Brighton Line&lt;/a&gt; to the West End Line terminating at &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Parkway%20%28BMT%20West%20End%20Line%29\"&gt;Bay Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It terminated at &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Avenue%20%28BMT%20West%20End%20Line%29\"&gt;Ninth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; during midday hours until 1995, when it was cut back to &lt;a href=\"Chambers%20Street%20%28BMT%20Nassau%20Street%20Line%29\"&gt;Chambers Street&lt;/a&gt;. It was extended again from 2001\u20132004 while the Manhattan Bridge was closed for reconstruction. In 2010, as part of a series of MTA budget cuts, rush-hour M service was discontinued.\nOn July 19, 2019, a project to install elevators at the &lt;a href=\"62nd%20Street/New%20Utrecht%20Avenue%20station\"&gt;62nd Street/New Utrecht Avenue station&lt;/a&gt; was completed. Starting on September 18, 2021, and continuing until January 3, 2022, southbound D trains terminated at Bay 50th Street so work could be completed to protect Coney Island Yard from flooding.\nChaining information.\nThe West End Line is &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Subway%20chaining\"&gt;chained&lt;/a&gt; BMT D. This is unrelated to the fact that since 2004, the primary service designator has also been D.\nIn popular culture.\nOver the years, the West End line has been featured in movies and television shows.
