It is primarily used for &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, and is the home arena of &lt;a href=\"TuTo\"&gt;TuTo&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally opened in 1973 and held 5,500 people.\nHistory.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"artificial%20ice\"&gt;artificial ice&lt;/a&gt; field in Kupittaan j\u00e4\u00e4halli was &lt;a href=\"Construction\"&gt;constructed&lt;/a&gt; in 1962; this, however, was an outdoor field where players were at the mercy of the weather. However, since the field was &lt;a href=\"Artificiality\"&gt;artificially&lt;/a&gt; frozen, the opening &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28sports%29\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; was much longer than with natural ice. The actual arena was constructed in 1973, allowing teams to play indoors. The new arena with a &lt;a href=\"Fan%20%28person%29\"&gt;spectator&lt;/a&gt; capacity of 3,000 was inaugurated on November 2006.\nTeams.\nIce hockey teams &lt;a href=\"TPS%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;TPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TuTo\"&gt;TuTo&lt;/a&gt;, and several other teams have played in this venue. When the new &lt;a href=\"Elys%C3%A9e%20Arena\"&gt;Elys\u00e9e Arena&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in 1990, TPS moved there. Since then, Kupittaan j\u00e4\u00e4halli has been known as the &lt;a href=\"home%20arena\"&gt;home arena&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"TuTo\"&gt;TuTo&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew arena.\nThe last games in the old arena were played in the &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28season%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; of 2005. The new arena with spectator capacity of 3,000 was inaugurated on November 2006."
