    "text": "The Bellona Platform is a submarine geological feature encompassing the &lt;a href=\"Chesterfield%20Islands\"&gt;Chesterfield Islands&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Bellona%20Reefs\"&gt;Bellona Reefs&lt;/a&gt; () west of &lt;a href=\"New%20Caledonia\"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt;. It was once a landmass, which became mostly submerged when sea levels rose at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Glacial%20Maximum\"&gt;Last Glacial Maximum&lt;/a&gt;, 20,000 years ago. It might have played a role in the spread of flora and fauna, including humans, in the southwest Pacific."
