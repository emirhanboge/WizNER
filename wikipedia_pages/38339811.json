    "text": "Voltaire (1826 \u2013 16 April 1848) was a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thoroughbred\"&gt;Thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horse%20racing\"&gt;racehorse&lt;/a&gt;. He won five of his six races, including the &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Cup\"&gt;Doncaster Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1828. After retiring from racing he became a successful &lt;a href=\"stallion\"&gt;stallion&lt;/a&gt;, siring &lt;a href=\"St.%20Leger%20Stakes\"&gt;St. Leger&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Charles%20the%20Twelfth\"&gt;Charles the Twelfth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voltigeur%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Voltigeur&lt;/a&gt;, who won both &lt;a href=\"Epsom%20Derby\"&gt;The Derby&lt;/a&gt; and the St. Leger. He was bred and owned by Robert Stephenson, before being sold to &lt;a href=\"William%20Vane%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;William Vane, Marquess of Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, whom he raced for as a three-year-old.\nBackground.\nVoltaire was a &lt;a href=\"Equine%20coat%20color%23Basic%20coat\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Colt%20%28horse%29\"&gt;colt&lt;/a&gt; bred by Robert Stephenson and foaled in 1826. He was sired by &lt;a href=\"Blacklock%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Blacklock&lt;/a&gt;, who won seventeen races including three &lt;a href=\"Great%20Subscription%20Purse\"&gt;Great Subscription Purse&lt;/a&gt;s. Blacklock was also a successful stallion and was the &lt;a href=\"leading%20sire%20in%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1829. Amongst his other progeny were York St. Leger winner &lt;a href=\"Velocipede%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Velocipede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Cup\"&gt;Doncaster Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt; winner Laurel. Voltaire was the fifth foal of his &lt;a href=\"Mare\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt;, an unnamed daughter of &lt;a href=\"Epsom%20Derby\"&gt;Epsom Derby&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacing career.\n1828: Two-year-old season.\nVoltaire made his debut on 9 April 1828 at &lt;a href=\"Catterick%20Bridge%20Racecourse\"&gt;Catterick Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, when he beat four rivals to win the Richmond Club Stakes. His only other start as a two-year-old came in July in the Tyro Stakes at Newcastle, where he faced five opponents. Starting as the 6/4 favourite and ridden by Sim Templeman, he won the race from Zodiac. During the winter he was amongst the favourites for the 1829 &lt;a href=\"St.%20Leger%20Stakes\"&gt;St. Leger Stakes&lt;/a&gt;.\n1829: Three-year-old season.\nVoltaire's first race as a three-year-old was The Shorts, a Sweepstakes of 50 &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20%28British%20coin%29\"&gt;sovereigns&lt;/a&gt; each over one mile at &lt;a href=\"York%20Racecourse\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;. He started at the 1/2 favourite and ridden by J. Day, he won the race from Penhill, with Elastic finishing in third place. He was one on nineteen horses to contest the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Leger%20Stakes\"&gt;St. Leger Stakes&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;a href=\"Rowton%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Rowton&lt;/a&gt; started the race as the favourite, with Frederick and Voltaire next at 4/1. Ridden by &lt;a href=\"William%20Scott%20%28jockey%29\"&gt;William Scott&lt;/a&gt;, Rowton took the lead a long way from the finish. Voltaire closed on the leader, but was still some distance behind as they entered the final furlong. Voltaire steadily closed on Rowton, who was being hard ridden, but could only finish second, a &lt;a href=\"Horse%20length\"&gt;neck&lt;/a&gt; behind Rowton. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hercules\"&gt;Sir Hercules&lt;/a&gt; was third, with Felt finishing in fourth.\nTwo days later Voltaire walked over for the Gascoigne Stakes, ran over the same course and distance as the St. Leger. Later in the day had his final race in the &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Cup\"&gt;Doncaster Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;, ran over two miles and five furlongs. Voltaire and the previous year's winner Laurel started the race at similar prices in the betting. Granby led the field at the start, until he was overtaken by Laurel, who was closely followed by Voltaire. The two raced together until Voltaire was asked to quicken by jockey Thomas Lye, when he pulled out a slight lead and won easily by half a length. Laurel finished the race in second place and Fleur de Lis in third. Voltaire was kept in training as a four-year-old, but never raced. This was due to a leg injury he sustained in the Gold Cup.\nStud career.\nIn 1832 Voltaire stood as a stallion at &lt;a href=\"Boroughbridge\"&gt;Boroughbridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of 10 sovereigns. By 1841 he was standing at an increased fee of 16 guineas.\nHis most notable progeny were:\nVoltaire died on 16 April 1848 at &lt;a href=\"Hart%2C%20County%20Durham\"&gt;Hart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt;. Voltigeur's son Vedette sired Galopin (Voltaire therefore appearing twice in the third generation of his pedigree), who sired the undefeated &lt;a href=\"St.%20Simon%20%28horse%29\"&gt;St. Simon&lt;/a&gt;. It is mainly through St. Simon that Voltaire's sire line survives today.\nPedigree.\n\"Note: b. = &lt;a href=\"Bay%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;, br. = &lt;a href=\"Equine%20coat%20color%23Basic%20coat\"&gt;Brown&lt;/a&gt;, ch. = &lt;a href=\"Chestnut%20%28coat%29\"&gt;Chestnut&lt;/a&gt;\""
