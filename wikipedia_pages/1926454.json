    "text": "Ripacandida is a town and \"&lt;a href=\"comune\"&gt;comune&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Potenza\"&gt;province of Potenza&lt;/a&gt;, in the Southern Italian region of &lt;a href=\"Basilicata\"&gt;Basilicata&lt;/a&gt;. It is bounded by the comuni of &lt;a href=\"Atella%2C%20Basilicata\"&gt;Atella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barile\"&gt;Barile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Filiano\"&gt;Filiano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forenza\"&gt;Forenza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ginestra%20%28PZ%29\"&gt;Ginestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rionero%20in%20Vulture\"&gt;Rionero in Vulture&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaeology.\nThe study of the necropolis, seventh-fifth century BC shows that the settlement belongs to a cultural center north of Lucania. It is located near a tributary of the broad stream '&lt;a href=\"Ofanto\"&gt;Ofanto&lt;/a&gt; and spread on top and on the terraces along the slopes of the hill. In the center is implanted ceramic workshops specialized in the production of decorated vases subgeometrica, or complex decorative motifs, including the human figure appears.\nA notable jug found in a female burial of the fifth century BC, has a sphere enclosing a lightning bolt on which there is a stylized human figure in mourning, surrounded by seven stars, now in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Melfi\"&gt;National Archaeological Museum of Melfi&lt;/a&gt;. This scene leads to the philosophical doctrines of Pythagoras, who had started a school at the same time to &lt;a href=\"Metaponto\"&gt;Metaponto&lt;/a&gt; and which were among his disciples some aristocratic figures of the ancient inland territories of Basilicata.\nThe ancient village of Ripacandida is organized to scattered groups of inhabited alternating with empty spaces and burials. Of note, always in a female burial, the &lt;a href=\"fermatrecce\"&gt;fermatrecce&lt;/a&gt; are very elaborate, consisting of a double wire wrapped in multiple turns and found only a few kits Basilicata inside. Remains of a Roman aqueduct are visible near the broad stream.\nGeography.\nRipacandida looks like a neat little town perched on the cliff which dominates the large valleys that surround it, made of whitewashed houses. It stands on one of the many hills in the &lt;a href=\"Vulture%20%28region%29\"&gt;Vulture&lt;/a&gt;, the vast region that stretches south of the river &lt;a href=\"Ofanto\"&gt;Ofanto&lt;/a&gt; (which forms the natural border of the northern &lt;a href=\"Basilicata\"&gt;Basilicata&lt;/a&gt;), region of deep-rooted origins history that is called &lt;a href=\"Melfi\"&gt;Melfi&lt;/a&gt;. It extends along the slopes of &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; of Vulture and is a large sub-area of &lt;a href=\"Basilicata\"&gt;Basilicata region&lt;/a&gt;, characterized by the cultivation and production of grapes \"&lt;a href=\"Aglianico\"&gt;Aglianico&lt;/a&gt;, which gives its name to one of the most renowned regional wines and appreciated, the\"'&lt;a href=\"Aglianico%20del%20Vulture\"&gt;Aglianico del Vulture&lt;/a&gt;\", precisely. Ripacandida rises from the rock on which you can enjoy the scenery as far as the eye can see, huge and impressive, while walking through the narrow streets of the main street, peering in the direction of the Vulture can be seen in all her radiant beauty, especially in light of the reddish clear summer sunsets, this mountain almost \"magic\" that dominates the landscape to &lt;a href=\"north\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"west\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe archaeological survey of the years 1977\u201380 due to the antiquity of Ripacandida the seventh century BC, but by the end of the nineteenth century historian Lucan &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Lacava\"&gt;Michele Lacava&lt;/a&gt; found some caves dating archeolitica and floor mosaics at the foot of Ripacandida.\nThe Greek historians (&lt;a href=\"Aristotle\"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timaeus%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Timaeus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20of%20Syracuse\"&gt;Antiochus of Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;) cite as \"&lt;a href=\"Enotria\"&gt;Enotria&lt;/a&gt;\" contemporary Basilicata. From\"Geography\"of &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; we learn that \"before the arrival of the Greeks on the Ionian coast of Basilicata, and there were Choni Enotri.\nThe second Oenotrian &lt;a href=\"Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt; descended from &lt;a href=\"Oenotrus\"&gt;Oenotrus&lt;/a&gt;, originating from the mythical hero 'Arcadia who arrived around 1800 BC, subjugated the indigenous plant and viticulture. His successor, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; became farmers, pastoralists, instituting the \"&lt;a href=\"Syssitia\"&gt;Syssitia&lt;/a&gt;\". Later the region was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Samnites\"&gt;Samnites&lt;/a&gt;, populations &lt;a href=\"Osco-Samnite\"&gt;Osco-Samnite&lt;/a&gt; from which descend the &lt;a href=\"Luciani\"&gt;Luciani&lt;/a&gt;. They descended from the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Sannio\"&gt;Sannio&lt;/a&gt; and in several waves occupied the peninsula. They practiced \"&lt;a href=\"sacred%20spring\"&gt;sacred spring&lt;/a&gt;\": when the population grew a group of young people choose a symbol (Totem) and partly in search of new lands. It was a nation of proud warriors, powerful enough to bind the Roman army for fifty years. Rome suffered the humiliation of defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Caudine%20Forks\"&gt;Caudine Forks&lt;/a&gt;, and then reorganize the army and crush the Samnites. The Romanization of the region came with the transfer of 20 000 settlers, was born near &lt;a href=\"Venosa\"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;, in 291 BC Samnites are descended from many other ethnic groups: the &lt;a href=\"Hirpini\"&gt;Hirpini&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caudini\"&gt;Caudini&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bruttii\"&gt;Bruttii&lt;/a&gt; etc. The Luke Society is organized into tribes, each with its own head i \"&lt;a href=\"Meddices\"&gt;Meddices&lt;/a&gt;\" who are elected annually. All are expected to participate in community life, everything is divided equally. Federation linked by a bond, in case of war, elect a head of the &lt;a href=\"basileus\"&gt;basileus&lt;/a&gt; \". The ancient town of Ripacandida Web site was more important than &lt;a href=\"Serra%20di%20Vaglio\"&gt;Serra di Vaglio&lt;/a&gt; (Vaglio Basilicata) a few miles from &lt;a href=\"Potenza%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;. The Lucan through rivers: &lt;a href=\"Basento\"&gt;Basento&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradano\"&gt;Bradano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agri%20%28river%29\"&gt;Agri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sinni%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sinni&lt;/a&gt; traded with the Greek cities (&lt;a href=\"Metaponto\"&gt;Metaponto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serres\"&gt;Siris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heraclea%20Lucania\"&gt;Heraclea&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Sele%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sele&lt;/a&gt; and '&lt;a href=\"Ofanto\"&gt;Ofanto&lt;/a&gt; allow access to both sides: the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian. Dialect idiom (true linguistic island in the neighborhood) we find the root of many words with the Oscan of Greek origin. Oral tradition says that the city was built by the Romans under the name \"Candida Latinorum\" (remains of Roman aqueduct). Some scholars believe the name is given by the white color of the hill. The modern town dates from the time of &lt;a href=\"invasions%20Gothic\"&gt;invasions Gothic&lt;/a&gt;, when the inhabitants moved from the valley on the hill, and build their houses around the temple dedicated to Jupiter (present castle-&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Santa%20Maria%20del%20Sepulchre\"&gt;Church mother&lt;/a&gt;). I &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombard&lt;/a&gt; the fortified walls interspersed with towers. Undergoing the various dominations arrive at the first written sources of the XI-XII sec. The papal bull &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eugene%20III\"&gt;Eugenius III&lt;/a&gt; (1152) decreed the construction of the churches of San Donato (the only one that still exists), San Pietro, San Zaccaria, San Gregorio. Participates in the First Crusade. And is registered in the Catalogue of the Barons with thirteen nobles, headed by the overlord Roger Marescalco to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Crusade\"&gt;Third Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Good\"&gt;William the Good&lt;/a&gt; (1188\u20131198). A Roberto Ripacandida of &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Frederick II&lt;/a&gt; in charge of guarding prisoners of Lombardy, the region will be called after Massa Lombarda (now Ginestra). Change number of feudal lords, &lt;a href=\"Caracciolo\"&gt;Caracciolo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grimaldi%20of%20Monaco\"&gt;Grimaldi of Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boccapianola\"&gt;Boccapianola&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tironi\"&gt;Tironi&lt;/a&gt;, the last owner is the Duke &lt;a href=\"Mazzacara\"&gt;Mazzacara&lt;/a&gt; (1806). A first colony Albanian refugees in 1482 is housed in a suburban area called Canton and later moved to Massa Lombarda. On 5 October 1571 share in the victory &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lepanto\"&gt;Battle of Lepanto&lt;/a&gt; with a large number of citizens including Gianlorenzo Lioy. Between five hundred and seven hundred is home to a study of Theology. In April 1861, sided with the robbers led by &lt;a href=\"Carmine%20Crocco\"&gt;Carmine Crocco&lt;/a&gt;, on this occasion there was the first victim: the National Guard captain Michael Anastasia. He also had fierce brigands Turtoro, Di Biase, Larotonda.\nThe end of the 19th century: heavy immigration to the United States.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the inhabitants of Ripacandida started immigrating in search of a better future, first to &lt;a href=\"Altoona%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Altoona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and then on to &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Island%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Blue Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. Two sons of immigrants from Ripacandida in Blue Island have become famous: boxer &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Musto\"&gt;Tony Musto&lt;/a&gt;, who fought &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Louis\"&gt;Joe Louis&lt;/a&gt; for the World Heavyweight Title on 8 April 1941 and &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Sinise\"&gt;Gary Sinise&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning actor, musician and director, who co-founded Chicago's &lt;a href=\"Steppenwolf%20Theater%20Company\"&gt;Steppenwolf Theater Company&lt;/a&gt;. In memory of the traditions in Ripacandida, the town of Blue Island celebrates &lt;a href=\"Donatus%20of%20Arezzo\"&gt;Saint Donatus of Arezzo&lt;/a&gt; with its Feast of St. Donatus every year in August. The &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics\"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to &lt;a href=\"William%20D.%20Phillips\"&gt;William Donald Phillips&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania, whose mother was born in Ripacandida in 1913 and moved to the United States in 1920.\n1940\u20131960.\nDuring the 1940s, Ripacandida was suffering under the wrath of Benito Mussolini. Many of the residents had to find shelter or stay in nearby caves. The Nazis circled all around the town to find all of the Jewish folk. Some died even if they were not Jewish, but died if they were crippled, had dark hair/dark eyes, and were a different culture besides European.\n1980\u20132000.\nFrom the 1980s to the early 2000s, German anthropologist Thomas Hauschild (member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and chair in the dpt. for social anthropology at the University at Halle/Saale, Germany) used to document extensively religious and political life in Ripacandida and surroundings. In this, he was supported by many protagonists from the local population, including Michele Ciccarella, Carmela \"Quartariegg'\" Carlucci Perretta, Vito Gioiosa, Luigi \"Ginetto\" Gilio, and many others. His findings were edited in the form of numerous articles in scientific journals and in his book \"Magie und Macht in Italien\" (2002), translated into English by Jeremy Gaines (\"Power and Magic in Italy\", London and New York, Berghahn publishers, 2011).\nIn 2009, Thomas Hauschild accompanied the famous art historian Hans Belting (Order Pour le M\u00e9rite of Arts and Sciences, Berlin and Dumbarton Oaks Institute, Harvard U.) to Ripacandida. On behalf of the local \"Pro Loco\" association (Gerardo Cripezzi, Luigi Gilio and others), Hans Belting evaluated the frescoes at the San Donato church at Ripacandida and attested to their extraordinary value as a monument in the history of arts. Following Belting, the frescoes reflect impressively periods of peace and unrest, of earthquake and new economic development in the small Lucanian centre. In this occasion, Hans Belting accepted the regional award \"Fede e Arte\" from the local UNESCO committee and from the Pro Loco. in a highly acclaimed speech, Hans Belting attested for the many \"secrets\" still hidden in these frescoes for future research.\nDialect vocabulary of Greek, Arabic and Albanian origin.\nGreek: Burnt by Braccos: hoarseness; Airale: sieve that is used to cleanse the grain from Aire: I choose; Alerta: stand on Aertao: I exalt; Arrampaggio: Harpagus robbery with violence: robbery; Ammannati Amenenoo by: soon weakens; Arrappato: folds from Raptiva, I patch; Arrociliare: enveloped by Kule: vulgar or deception; Ascimo: unfermented bread; Atta'ne: Tata-father from Atta: pater; Butter: a young peasant from Boter: shepherd Cacone: deep hole by Kao: opening; Calanca: landslide Kala-Ekalaca: drop; Calandra: The lark from Akalantis; Kalavroje: Scaravaggi daKarabos; Calamastra: opener hanging on the iron stove, Karusi: haircut Keiro: I cut ; Kataratta: hatch Kata: downward '; Kotor: capers! by Katara, Centrino: Kitri from yellow cedar; Kiatto: big and fat; Cozzetto: occiput from Kotido; CuCl: cakes to Kuklos: circle, Enchire: empire from Egketo: breathe; : desert place: from Eremos-desert; Fomiero: manure; Ravine: water that is poured; Engineer: start using; Isc'i: entry mulattirer; Lagana: Lasagna; Langella: pot of water; Maca'ri God! exclamation; Mara me (bad omen); Maruca: snail; Matreia: stepmother; Mattoli: bundle; Menace: throw by Amun: reject, mingling: small; Mollica: the pith of bread Montone: pile; Morra of sheep flock sheep; Musco: humerus of the body; madness: jokes from Pazio: game; Pernecocca: apricot; Lace: ends; Pruna: plum tree; Quatrala: nubile young girl from Korah and girl-girl Talis; Racana: fabric due; Burr; root; Ranfa: claws of animals, Rasco-scratch: scratch; Rosica: nibble; Rummolo: rounded stone; Salma: soma; Scania loaf of bread; Sceppa: rip; Skizo: drop; Silk: sieve; Sfizio: wishful thinking; Scitt: hunting cats; Sterpone: old tree; Strambo: Crank brain Strummolo: top; Tallo: bud; Tann: then; Tarocciola: pulley; Traccheggiare: hold off; Tumpagno: bottom of the barrel; Tupputi Tupputi: to beat door Turso: core of the cabbage; Tuzzolare: knock on the door; Vallone: narrow ditch; Brag: apron: Launch: Opening; Visciole: vesicles; Zimmari: the goat; Zitella: servant; Zito: husband. The Greek words are transcribed in English letters.\nOn the deep influence of Albanic language on the local dialect see also: https://web.archive.org/web/20111011091746/http://contrasto.de/lucano.htm and .\nMuch vocabulary in the local dialects at Ripacandia -and in Northern Lucania in general -is also deduced from the Arabic language, for example \"vadone\" from \"al wadi\" for \"river stream\". See: Bigalke, Rainer: \"Dizionario dialettale della basilicata|Con un breve saggio della fonetica, un'introduzione sulla storia dei dialetti lucani e note etimologiche\", Muenster, 1980. German linguist Bigalke did his fieldwork in the 1980s all over the Basilicata and shortly also at Ripacandida.\nMonuments of interest.\nThe center of town has architecture of mainly the 18th and 19th century. The exception is the Casa Lioy, a palace built in 1089 with subsequent reconstructions.\nReligious architecture.\nThe interior has a chapel of the sacrament by &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Battista%20Rossi\"&gt;Giovanni Battista Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, who also completed the polychrome marble balustrade of the presbytery. In four columns of the balustrades are bas- reliefs of the Passion of Christ. The sacristy houses a \"Piet\u00e0\" by &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Danone\"&gt;Christian Danone&lt;/a&gt; and a \"St. Bartholomew\" by &lt;a href=\"Gaetano%20Recco\"&gt;Gaetano Recco&lt;/a&gt;.\nSan Donato Sanctuary.\nAt the entrance from the &lt;a href=\"north\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"east\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; up area there is the ancient shrine of &lt;a href=\"Ripacandida%20by%20Donato\"&gt;San Donato by Ripacandida&lt;/a&gt;, patron of the town, with its &lt;a href=\"Fresco\"&gt;paintings&lt;/a&gt; of 1500 and its millennial history. The adjacent \"villa\", the churchyard behind the millennial center of pilgrimage, contains meticulously cultivated trees that derive from the 16th century or earlier.\nThe local feast of Saint Donatus (5\u20137 August) is one of the oldest and most beautiful festivals of saints of the Basilicata, showing still remnants of authentic old folk customs.\nThe shrine, one of the most famous of Basilicata, is affiliated with the church of &lt;a href=\"Basilica%20of%20San%20Francesco%20d%27Assisi\"&gt;San Francesco&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Assisi\"&gt;Assisi&lt;/a&gt; and received the gift of a relic of the patron saint of Italy.\nIn December 2010, the sanctuary gets from '&lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; recognition of &lt;a href=\"Monumento%20a%20messenger%20of%20peace%20culture\"&gt;Monumento a messenger of peace culture&lt;/a&gt; to the profound spiritual values that for centuries forward.\nNaturalistic.\nThe Forest.\nOne of the natural beauty of the wood is Ripacandida, though little appreciated.\nCalled the Great Forest, perhaps because it was originally more of a big region. One of the few residues of the immense forests that covered the Lucania (for Latin lucus = wood), now much reduced as a result of uncontrolled cuts. Composed of tall trees such as oaks, cedars, etc.. For centuries it has employed, fed and warm during the cold winters of the population Ripacandida and neighboring countries.\nThe peasants, including women fearless and courageous, they went to the woods to cut and then sell what was called a \"body\" of wood. Uploaded on mules, was brought to sell in neighboring countries. Refuge and breeding herds, during the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"transhumance\"&gt;transhumance&lt;/a&gt;\", which used the forest as a resting place for their long journeys. Also has a construction called \"mansions\" and \"pile\" that is, drinking troughs for animals. During the robbery, was a refuge for the robbers, who used the many caves to avoid capture.\nLa Pineta.\nThe pine forest was planted in the late fifties to the base and on the slopes of the hill on which stands Ripacandida. On fire repeatedly over the years, resistant in some areas, where she grew lush and precisely to the base and side Rionero. Since 2006, (i.e. since the Fonti del Vulture were bought by a famous multinational company), we see in the spot of '&lt;a href=\"Water%20Lilies\"&gt;Water Lily&lt;/a&gt; where it makes a fine show.\nTraditions.\nThe game of Morra.\nOne of the favorite pastimes ripacandidesi, especially by men, was the &lt;a href=\"Morra%20%28game%29\"&gt;game of Morra&lt;/a&gt;. During the long winter evenings but also to distract them from the drudgery of the fields two or more people are delighted to \"guess the sum of the fingers shown in the game for two players.\" The winner was a good shot of \"Aglianico\". The first news of the game of Morra date back to ancient &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, but probably were the Roman soldiers to spread in Italy, because it was very common in ancient &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. The success of the game is because it only requires the use of hands, a game so that you can play everywhere, poor but not simple, requiring skill and intelligence. The player must think in fractions of a second in two ways: to predict the opponent's game and never play the numbers that you expect your opponent. In recent years, associations have been created at national level who seek to take up the slack. Today, the Morra has become a rarely practiced custom.\nEaster Bread.\nThe characteristic shape braided bread traditionally prepared for the Passover is called \"rucilatieggh\". Do not know the origin of the custom of the Easter bread, unique among other things, because neighboring countries does not exist. Prepared by the good housewife, was then baked in the houses, each house had its oven.\n\"I rucilatieggh\" were prepared from a dough of flour, oil, water, fennel seeds, eggs, salt and baking powder and then polished with egg yolk. The tradition continues in the bakery who prepare for Tuesday and Friday.\nThe cupboard.\nTraditionally every house had Ripacandida the oven for baking bread, which had a high form of bread similar to &lt;a href=\"matter\"&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;. The bread was baked once placed in the cupboard, which was also used for mixing, 'lu'mpasta'pan'. In every kitchen there was this piece of furniture that was in the form of a box: two doors, two drawers and upper compartment with hinged lid flare. After the fifties, retired skilled tradesmen all the antique furniture in exchange for plastic containers. To the cry of 'mobil'viecch' reaping what to ripacandidesi no longer needed, then restore them and sell them at high prices.\nEvents.\nFestivities in honor of saints:\nGovernment.\nMayor Vito Antonio Remollino from 2013\nTwin towns.\nRipacandida is &lt;a href=\"Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with \nIn addition, Ripacandida has signed a friendship agreement with: "
