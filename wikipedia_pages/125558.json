As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, the township's population was 21,528, reflecting an increase of 689 (+3.3%) from the 20,839 counted in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2000 Census&lt;/a&gt;, which had in turn increased by 5,239 (+33.6%) from the 15,600 counted in the &lt;a href=\"1990%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;1990 Census&lt;/a&gt;.\nMontville was incorporated as a township by an act of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Legislature\"&gt;New Jersey Legislature&lt;/a&gt; on April 11, 1867, from portions of &lt;a href=\"Pequannock%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pequannock Township&lt;/a&gt;. It includes the sections of Montville, &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Brook%2C%20Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Brook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Towaco%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Towaco&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"NJ%20Transit\"&gt;NJ Transit&lt;/a&gt; rail service is available at the &lt;a href=\"Towaco%20station\"&gt;Towaco station&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Montclair-Boonton%20Line\"&gt;Montclair-Boonton Line&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Money%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's 2013 Best Places to Live rankings, Montville was ranked 13th in the nation, the second-highest among the three places in New Jersey included in the top 50 list. The township was ranked 17th in the magazine's 2011 ranking of the \"Best Places to Live\", the highest-ranked place in New Jersey, after having been ranked 13th in 2007. In 2009, \"&lt;a href=\"Money%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine named Montville the 21st best place to live in the United States; the 2nd highest ranked community in New Jersey.\nHistory.\nNative settlement.\nOver 10,000 years ago, the area was part of the &lt;a href=\"Lenapehoking\"&gt;Lenapehoking.&lt;/a&gt; It was originally settled by the &lt;a href=\"Lenape\"&gt;Lenape&lt;/a&gt; tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Munsee\"&gt;Munsee&lt;/a&gt; dialect. The Lenape tribes maintained peace and no significant battles were recorded in the area. \nOn October 12th, the &lt;a href=\"Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Morris County&lt;/a&gt; Parks Commission holds Lenape Day at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the culture and history of Ramapough Lenape people.\nDutch settlement.\nDutch farmers from &lt;a href=\"New%20Amsterdam\"&gt;New Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; (now part of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;) entered the area in 1710. As part of &lt;a href=\"New%20Netherland\"&gt;New Netherland&lt;/a&gt;, the town was originally called \"Uyle-Kill\" (the Dutch spelling of \"Owl-Kill\"), a name given to the creek and valley, which ran through the area. \nBy the 1740s, the settlement had grown in size and construction of the first road was begun. The early road, now known as &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20202\"&gt;U.S. Route 202&lt;/a&gt;, connected various farms with Montville's first gristmill, sawmill and tanneries. \nIn 1756, the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Reformed%20Church\"&gt;Dutch Reformed Church&lt;/a&gt; was founded in Old Boonton and moved to Montville in the early 1800s after land was purchased in Montville for a parsonage.\nEnglish settlement.\nIn 1712, &lt;a href=\"William%20Penn\"&gt;William Penn&lt;/a&gt; bought a tract of land that included parts of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Pequannock%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pequannock&lt;/a&gt; and Montville that included &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Brook%2C%20Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Brook&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1760, the first schoolhouse in the Montville township was built out of &lt;a href=\"Log%20building\"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Brook%2C%20Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Brook&lt;/a&gt;. It was located on \"the road leading to Boonton,\" which could refer to multiple northwest-facing roads including Changebridge Road. Additional schools were constructed in 1785, 1816, and 1852.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; (1775-1783), Montville was on a major military route from &lt;a href=\"Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Morristown&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%20River\"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt;. General &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington\"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt;'s troops often took this route and Washington stayed in the Towaco section of what is now Montville Township in June 1780. The French troops under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau\"&gt;General Rochambeau&lt;/a&gt; spent four days passing through Montville Township on their way to the War's final victory at &lt;a href=\"Yorktown%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Yorktown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a group of 5,000 soldiers, 2,000 horses, 500 oxen, possibly 900 cattle, artillery, boats and followers.\nThe Mandeville Inn was established around 1770 and was pronounced \"Mondeveil\" by the Dutch, which in turn was corrupted to Montville. The Montville Inn was, up until July 2006, located at the site of the pre-Revolutionary War Mandeville Inn, which burned down in the early 20th century. Other sources attribute the township's name to its location in the mountains of Northern New Jersey.\nIn 1809, the first store in Montville was opened by Conrad Esler. In 1820, Montville contained 16 houses, 2 &lt;a href=\"Bark%20mill\"&gt;bark mills&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gristmill\"&gt;grist mill&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cider%20mill\"&gt;cider mill&lt;/a&gt; and distillery, a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; shop, a &lt;a href=\"Carpentry\"&gt;carpenter&lt;/a&gt; shop, a &lt;a href=\"wheelwright\"&gt;wheelwright&lt;/a&gt; shop, and a small &lt;a href=\"General%20store\"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;; at the time, Montville was considered a business center compared to nearby towns. By 1880, it contained 40 houses, a bark mill, two grist mills, a tannery, a saw mill, a &lt;a href=\"Natural%20rubber\"&gt;rubber factory&lt;/a&gt;, two blacksmith shops, two &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20in%20North%20America\"&gt;taverns&lt;/a&gt;, and 2 stores.\nThe construction of the &lt;a href=\"Morris%20Canal\"&gt;Morris Canal&lt;/a&gt; in this area was completed in 1828, bringing commercial navigation to the Montville/Towaco area. The mid-19th century saw the development of two smaller village centers set apart from Montville: &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Brook%2C%20Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Brook&lt;/a&gt;, a fertile agricultural area in the Township's southern end, and &lt;a href=\"Towaco%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Towaco&lt;/a&gt;, situated on the Morris Canal.\nIn 1867, Montville and &lt;a href=\"Boonton%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Boonton&lt;/a&gt; split off from &lt;a href=\"Pequannock%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pequannock&lt;/a&gt; township.\n20th century.\nBy 1910, the population of Montville was 690.\nThe Pine Brook Speedway, which operated from July 1962 until October 1989, was designed for &lt;a href=\"midget%20car%20racing\"&gt;midget car racing&lt;/a&gt; and became one of the earliest sites for &lt;a href=\"microstock%20%28racing%29\"&gt;microstock&lt;/a&gt; racing. &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Andretti\"&gt;Mario Andretti&lt;/a&gt; raced at the track and had some of his earliest success as a race car driver at the Speedway.\n2019-2021 Coronavirus Pandemic.\nMayor Frank Cooney (&lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;) announced that he had COVID-19 on March 30, 2020 through a press release.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the township had a total area of 19.12 square miles (49.51\u00a0km2), including 18.63 square miles (48.24\u00a0km2) of land and 0.49 square miles (1.27\u00a0km2) of water (2.57%).\n&lt;a href=\"Local%20government%20in%20New%20Jersey%23Unincorporated%20communities\"&gt;Unincorporated communities&lt;/a&gt;, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Horse Neck Bridge, Lake Valhalla, Lower Montville, &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Brook%2C%20Morris%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Pine Brook&lt;/a&gt;, Taylortown, &lt;a href=\"Towaco%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Towaco&lt;/a&gt; and White Hall.\nThe township borders the municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Boonton%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Boonton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boonton%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Boonton Township&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Hanover%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;East Hanover Township&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kinnelon%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Kinnelon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Lincoln Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parsippany-Troy%20Hills%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Parsippany-Troy Hills&lt;/a&gt; in Morris County; and &lt;a href=\"Fairfield%20Township%2C%20Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Fairfield Township&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Essex County&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamp Dawson is a small camp area in Towaco that is home to a variety of recreational events such as hiking, sledding, soccer, lacrosse, rugby and football. In 2007, Camp Dawson was described by &lt;a href=\"Money%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Money (magazine)&lt;/a&gt; as one of reasons for ranking Montville as the 13th best smaller population place to live in the United States. Many Montville sports teams use the fields at Camp Dawson, which include two turf fields mainly used for &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lacrosse\"&gt;lacrosse&lt;/a&gt;. These fields have lighting available for these teams to play at night. There was a flurry of concern in 2008, when testing of Dawson's new artificial turf playing fields showed what turned out to be false positive finding of dangerously high levels of toxic lead.\nClimate.\nThe lowest recorded temperature in Montville is \u221225\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221232\u00a0\u00b0C), set in February 1943, and the highest recorded temperature is 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C), set in July 1936 and 2011.\nDemographics.\nCensus 2010.\nThe Census Bureau's 2006-2010 &lt;a href=\"American%20Community%20Survey\"&gt;American Community Survey&lt;/a&gt; showed that (in 2010 &lt;a href=\"inflation%20adjustment\"&gt;inflation-adjusted&lt;/a&gt; dollars) &lt;a href=\"median%20household%20income\"&gt;median household income&lt;/a&gt; was $119,493 (with a margin of error of +/- $12,959) and the median family income was $143,811 (+/- $17,082).
