She was curator of Prints and Drawings at the India Office Library and wrote extensively on the collection and studies on them. \nBorn Mildred Agnes Bell, she attended school in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. In 1930 she joined &lt;a href=\"St%20Hilda%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;St Hilda's College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt; with a history scholarship. She met &lt;a href=\"W.G.%20Archer\"&gt;Bill Archer&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a friend of her brother at Cambridge.

Bill left for India in 1931 and the two were engaged just before he left. After marriage Bill worked in &lt;a href=\"Bihar\"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt; for nearly a decade and on his return to England he became Keeper of Indian Art at the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum\"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/a&gt; and was a leading scholar of Indian court painting and the &lt;a href=\"Company%20style\"&gt;Company style&lt;/a&gt;. \nMildred Archer's curatorial career began in 1954 with the cataloguing of the &lt;a href=\"British%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;East India Company's&lt;/a&gt; collection of paintings in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"India%20Office\"&gt;India Office&lt;/a&gt; Library. It occupied her for 26 years. \nOther works included \"Natural History Drawings\" (1962), \"British Drawings\" (1969), \"Company Drawings\" (1972), \"Indian Popular Painting\" (1977) and finally (with Toby Falk) \"Indian Miniature Paintings\" (1981). In 1979 she wrote \"British Portraiture 1770-1825\". Her later publications included a study of the Daniell &lt;a href=\"aquatint\"&gt;aquatint&lt;/a&gt;s of India (1980), the V&amp;A exhibition catalogue \"India Observed\" (1982), and studies of William Simpson's Indian sketchbooks (1986) and the prints and Company paintings associated with James and William Fraser (1989).
