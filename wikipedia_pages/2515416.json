    "text": "Southwell (, ) is a town in the district of &lt;a href=\"Newark%20and%20Sherwood\"&gt;Newark and Sherwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It includes &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20Minster\"&gt;Southwell Minster&lt;/a&gt;, the cathedral of the Anglican &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Southwell%20and%20Nottingham\"&gt;Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. A population of under 7,000 rose to 7,297 at the 2011 Census, and was put at 6,853 in 2019. The origin of the name is unclear. It lies on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Greet\"&gt;River Greet&lt;/a&gt;, about 14 miles (22 km) north-east of &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;. Other historic buildings include &lt;a href=\"Prebends%20of%20Southwell\"&gt;prebendal houses&lt;/a&gt; in Church Street and Westgate and the &lt;a href=\"Methodism\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; church, which has a right of way beneath it, so that the upper floor seats more than the lower. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Workhouse%2C%20Southwell\"&gt;workhouse&lt;/a&gt; (1824) was a prototype for many others. Owned by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;, it shows its appearance in the 19th century. Behind the Minster is a partly ruined palace, once a residence of the Archbishop of York. It includes the recently restored State Chamber, Cardinal Wolsey's former dining room, and gardens among the ruins.\nToponymy.\nThe origin of the name is unclear. Several sites claim to be the original \"well\", notably at GR where a plaque has been placed; in the \"&lt;a href=\"George%20Brydges%20Rodney\"&gt;Admiral Rodney&lt;/a&gt;\" pub; on the south side of the Minster, known as Lady Well in the 19th century; and one by the &lt;a href=\"cloisters\"&gt;cloisters&lt;/a&gt; called Holy Well. &lt;a href=\"Norwell%2C%20Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Norwell&lt;/a&gt;, eight miles north-west, may support the idea of a pair of \"south\" and \"north\" wells.\nEarly history.\nThe remains of an opulent &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt; were excavated beneath the Minster and its &lt;a href=\"churchyard\"&gt;churchyard&lt;/a&gt; in 1959. Part of a mural from the excavation is displayed in the Minster. It is one of three of its type found in the territories of the &lt;a href=\"Corieltauvi\"&gt;Corieltauvi (or Coritani)&lt;/a&gt; tribes \u2013 along with &lt;a href=\"Scampton\"&gt;Scampton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt; and Norfolk Street in &lt;a href=\"Leicestershire\"&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/a&gt;. A stretch of the &lt;a href=\"Fosse%20Way\"&gt;Fosse Way&lt;/a&gt; runs on the far bank of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Trent\"&gt;River Trent&lt;/a&gt;, with evidence of Roman settlement at Ad Pontem (\"to the bridge\" or \"at the bridge\"), north-west of the village of &lt;a href=\"East%20Stoke%2C%20Nottinghamshire\"&gt;East Stoke&lt;/a&gt;. There is no clear evidence of a road between Ad Pontem and Southwell. Other evidence of Roman settlement includes the use of Roman bricks in &lt;a href=\"prebendary\"&gt;prebendary&lt;/a&gt; buildings around the Minster, remains of a &lt;a href=\"ditch\"&gt;ditch&lt;/a&gt; or fosse discovered at &lt;a href=\"Burgage\"&gt;Burgage&lt;/a&gt; Hill in the 19th century, and possibly Roman remains beneath the Church Street site of the recently vacated Minster School.\nThe Venerable &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; records a multiple baptism in the \"flood of the Trent\" near \"Tiovulginacester\" by &lt;a href=\"Paulinus%20of%20York\"&gt;Paulinus&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20of%20Northumbria\"&gt;Edwin of Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had converted to Christianity in 627. There is disagreement on the location of Tiovulginacester, but Paulinus certainly visited it and may have founded the first church in Southwell.\nRemains of &lt;a href=\"Repton%20Abbey%23Abbesses%20of%20Repton\"&gt;Eadburh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abbess\"&gt;Abbess&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Repton\"&gt;Repton&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ealdwulf%20of%20East%20Anglia\"&gt;Ealdwulf of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt; were buried in Southwell's &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20architecture\"&gt;Saxon church&lt;/a&gt;. Eadburh was appointed Abbess under the patronage of King &lt;a href=\"Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia\"&gt;Wulfhere of Mercia&lt;/a&gt;. She appears in the Life of &lt;a href=\"Guthlac\"&gt;Guthlac&lt;/a&gt; and is thought to have died about AD 700. Her remains were buried or translated to Southwell Minster, and revered there in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. The only reference is in a \"Pilgrims Guide to Shrines and Burial Places of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20saints\"&gt;Saints of England&lt;/a&gt;\" supposedly written in 1000: \"There resteth St. Eadburh in the Minster of Southwell near the water called the Trent.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eadwig\"&gt;Eadwy of England&lt;/a&gt; gave land in Southwell to &lt;a href=\"Oskytel\"&gt;Oskytel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of York&lt;/a&gt;, in 956, this charter being the first dated reference to Southwell. In 1051 Archbishop &lt;a href=\"%C3%86lfric%20Puttoc\"&gt;\u00c6lfric Puttoc&lt;/a&gt; died at Southwell, which indicates that the archiepiscopal residence and church might have been established by then. A &lt;a href=\"tessellated\"&gt;tessellated&lt;/a&gt; floor and the 11th-century &lt;a href=\"tympanum%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;tympanum&lt;/a&gt; over a doorway in the north &lt;a href=\"transept\"&gt;transept&lt;/a&gt; are evidence of construction of the Minster after this time. The &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; (1086) gives detail of an archiepiscopal manor in Southwell.\nA custom known as the \"Gate to Southwell\" originated after 1109, when the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20of%20Bayeux\"&gt;Thomas I&lt;/a&gt;, wrote to each Nottinghamshire parish for contributions to building of a new &lt;a href=\"mother%20church\"&gt;mother church&lt;/a&gt;. Annually at &lt;a href=\"Whitsuntide\"&gt;Whitsuntide&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting \"Southwell Pence\" were taken to the Minster in a procession from Nottingham, headed by the Mayor and followed by &lt;a href=\"clergy\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laity\"&gt;lay people&lt;/a&gt; bound for Southwell's &lt;a href=\"Whitsun\"&gt;Whitsun&lt;/a&gt; Fair. The Pence were paid at the Minster's north porch to the &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Clerk\"&gt;Chapter Clerk&lt;/a&gt;. The \"gate\" in the name of Southwell Gate means \"street\", as in many East Midland and North-Eastern street names. The custom in its original form persisted well into the 16th century. It was revived in 1981 by the Dolphin Morrismen, but imposition of traffic-management costs forced the organisers to abandon it in 2014. It is survived by the Gate to Southwell Festival, a broad musical event held every early June since 2007 on a site near Southwell and at various venues in the town.\n&lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29\"&gt;Geoffrey Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; was ordained a priest at Southwell in 1189. On 4 April 1194, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard I&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Scots\"&gt;King of Scots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;William I&lt;/a&gt;, were in Southwell, having spent &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Sunday\"&gt;Palm Sunday&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Clipstone\"&gt;Clipstone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20England\"&gt;King John&lt;/a&gt; visited Southwell between 1207 and 1213, ostensibly to hunt in &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Forest\"&gt;Sherwood Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but also on the way to expedition to &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in 1212.\n1300\u20131800.\nThe \"Saracen's Head\" was built in 1463 on land gifted in 1396 by Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Arundel\"&gt;Thomas Arundel&lt;/a&gt; of York to John and Margaret Fysher. When built, the first floor overhung the roadway in the style of the time.\nIn 1603, &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James VI of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; passed through Southwell on his way to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to be crowned &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;King James I&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;King Charles I&lt;/a&gt; spent his last night as a free man in May 1646 in the \"Saracen's Head\" (then the \"King's Head)\", before surrendering to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Army\"&gt;Scottish Army&lt;/a&gt; stationed at nearby &lt;a href=\"Kelham\"&gt;Kelham&lt;/a&gt;. The town, the Minster and the Archbishop's Palace suffered under &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell's&lt;/a&gt; troops, as they &lt;a href=\"Sequestration%20%28law%29\"&gt;sequestered&lt;/a&gt; the palace to stable their horses, broke monuments, and ransacked graves for lead and other valuables. In 1793, there were still iron rings in the walls to secure the horses. By end of the war the Archbishop's Palace was in ruins apart from its Great Hall. It is reputed that Cromwell also stayed at the \"King's Head\".\nA &lt;a href=\"Bridewell\"&gt;Bridewell&lt;/a&gt; built on the Burgage in 1656 was enlarged in 1787 to become a county prison. There is evidence that a &lt;a href=\"house%20of%20correction\"&gt;house of correction&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1611, so that the Bridewell may itself have been an enlargement. &lt;a href=\"Bramley%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Mary Ann Brailsford&lt;/a&gt; of apple fame (see below) was baptised at Southwell in May 1791, and &lt;a href=\"Bramley%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Matthew Bramley&lt;/a&gt; in 1796 in &lt;a href=\"Balderton\"&gt;Balderton&lt;/a&gt;.\n19th century and later.\nBy 1801 the population was 2,305. In 1803, &lt;a href=\"George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron\"&gt;Lord Byron&lt;/a&gt; stayed with his mother in Burgage Manor during holidays from &lt;a href=\"Harrow%20School\"&gt;Harrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. His mother rented the house. By that time he had become 6th Baron Byron of &lt;a href=\"Rochdale\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt;, but the family home, &lt;a href=\"Newstead%20Abbey\"&gt;Newstead Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, still required repairs, which they could not afford.\nSouthwell today.\nAs the site of an &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the town is sometimes taken as a city and was treated as such in the &lt;a href=\"1911%20Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica\"&gt;1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;. However, its &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;city status&lt;/a&gt; is not recognised by the government. Southwell has an active Town Council.\nThe town is something of an oddity in North &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;, being visibly affluent compared with neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Newark-on-Trent\"&gt;Newark-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mansfield\"&gt;Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;. Agriculture and coal have seen the fortunes of the other two fluctuate over the years, while Southwell has remained a place where wealthier Nottinghamians like to reside. It appeared in the \"Sunday Times\" shortlist of Best Places to Live 2017 for the Midlands region.\nIn most of Nottinghamshire, Southwell is pronounced SUH-thull, with a voiced \"th\" and a silent \"w\". Southwell's own residents tend to pronounce it as it is spelt.\nThe Town Council, since the 2019 elections, consists of eight Liberal Democrat councillors, four Conservatives and two Independents. The Council Chair was held in 2019\u20132021 by Mrs Lyn Harris (Lib. Dem.) and since then by Sally Reynolds (Independent). The Chair of the Town Environment Committee is Peter Harris, that of the Governance and Finance Committee Martin Stott and that of the Planning Committee Peter Scorer (all three Lib. Dem.) The town and surrounding villages and hamlets are represented as District Councillors by Malcolm Brock (Lib. Dem.), Peter Harris (Lib. Dem.) and Penny Rainbow (Con.)\nThe town's two infant schools (aged 3\u20135) are Southwell Holy Trinity C of E and Lowes Wong . The latter also teaches children aged 7\u201311. The local &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20Minster%20School\"&gt;Southwell Minster School&lt;/a&gt;, which also educates the choristers of the Minster and gifted musicians in its Junior Department. It has particularly good &lt;a href=\"GCSE\"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; and AS/A level results for Nottinghamshire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bramley%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Bramley cooking apple&lt;/a&gt; was first seeded in Southwell, by Mary Ann Brailsford in 1809. Henry Merryweather, a local nurseryman then 17 years old, saw potential and cultivated it from cuttings. The apple is widely used and renowned for its acidic taste and for cooking into a smooth pur\u00e9e. One local football club, Southwell City, is nicknamed \"The Bramleys\" and the town's new &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; and youth centre are termed the Bramley Centre. In March 2009, a stained-glass window was placed in Southwell Minister to mark the apple's bicentenary.\nThe local community newspaper is \"The Bramley\", of which some 11,200 copies a month are delivered free in and around Southwell.\nSports clubs include Southwell Rugby Club (known as the Redmen), formed in 1922\u20131923. In the 2011\u20132012 season, it won a historic treble as RFU Midlands 4 (East) North League Champions, Nottinghamshire Junior Cup winners and Nottinghamshire/Lincolnshire/Derbyshire Plate winners. There is also a Southwell Cricket Club. Southwell City Football Club, an FA Charter Standard Community Club, involves over 400 local players in 35 teams aged five years to veteran.\nSouthwell has a leisure centre run by a local trust, with trustees from the community, although the district council also provides limited support.\nThe annual Southwell Music Festival is held every August in &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20Minster\"&gt;Southwell Minster&lt;/a&gt; and other nearby venues. The Gate to Southwell Festival of roots and acoustic music is held each year in early June.\nSouthwell Racecourse, owned by the Arena Racing Company, is situated on the outskirts of the town near Fiskerton and has an all-weather track. It hosts jump and flat racing.\nThe town is linked to Newark and Nottingham by the &lt;a href=\"A612%20road\"&gt;A612&lt;/a&gt;, although this has now been downgraded to a C road, and to north Nottingham and villages to the west by B6386. The &lt;a href=\"A617%20road\"&gt;A617&lt;/a&gt; primary route passes 2 miles north of the town in &lt;a href=\"Hockerton\"&gt;Hockerton&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A46%20road\"&gt;A46&lt;/a&gt; trunk routes are 7 miles away in Newark. The &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; at the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Fiskerton%2C%20Nottinghamshire\"&gt;Fiskerton&lt;/a&gt; has gained a small &lt;a href=\"car%20park\"&gt;car park&lt;/a&gt; in recent years to cater for Southwell &lt;a href=\"commuter\"&gt;commuter&lt;/a&gt;s. Southwell is also served by &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20City%20Transport\"&gt;Nottingham City Transport&lt;/a&gt;'s rural Pathfinder 26 service to Nottingham and Stagecoach East Midlands (Mansfield) service to Mansfield and Newark. There are other infrequent services to nearby villages.\nThe town is twinned with &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9es\"&gt;S\u00e9es&lt;/a&gt; in France and &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD%20Brod\"&gt;\u010cesk\u00fd Brod&lt;/a&gt; in the Czech Republic.\nCommunities.\nTown districts.\nThe historic town centre is based around the cathedral area, but nearby outlying communities grew and eventually were subsumed into the town.\nLocalities.\nSeparated further afield from the core urban area, but within the parish are the following places:\nNotable people.\nIn order of birth:\nTransport links.\nRailway stations.\nSouthwell was previously served by a branch line which ran from &lt;a href=\"Rolleston%20railway%20station\"&gt;Rolleston Junction&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mansfield%20railway%20station%20%28England%29\"&gt;Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;. There was a &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20railway%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; on the line which served the town. It was opened in 1847, but closed to passengers in 1959 and to goods traffic in 1964. The station survives as a private residence. The trackbed towards Mansfield is now the Southwell Trail. The trackbed to Rolleston Junction is now covered by housing within the town and goes on to form a private access road from Southwell to &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20Racecourse\"&gt;Southwell Racecourse&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the nearest station to the town is over two miles away in &lt;a href=\"Fiskerton%20railway%20station\"&gt;Fiskerton&lt;/a&gt;, although Rolleston Junction is also near the racecourse. Both stations offer a service between &lt;a href=\"Matlock%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Matlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leicester\"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newark-on-Trent\"&gt;Newark-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derby%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nSecondary education in the town is predominantly provided by &lt;a href=\"The%20Minster%20School%2C%20Southwell\"&gt;The Minster School&lt;/a&gt;, which still educates choristers of &lt;a href=\"Southwell%20Minster\"&gt;Southwell Minster&lt;/a&gt;. The Minster School is a Specialist College for Humanities and Music and was rated outstanding by &lt;a href=\"Ofsted\"&gt;Ofsted&lt;/a&gt; in 2011/2012. Pupils may also choose to attend school at &lt;a href=\"Newark-on-Trent\"&gt;Newark-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt;, which is about a 20-minute drive east. The School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences is part of Nottingham Trent University. and offers further and higher education courses in agricultural-related subjects at its &lt;a href=\"Brackenhurst\"&gt;Brackenhurst&lt;/a&gt; campus just outside Southwell."
