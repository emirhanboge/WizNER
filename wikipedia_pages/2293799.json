He earned an &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; scholarship to &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20College%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Gordon College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and graduated with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;Bachelor of Science&lt;/a&gt; degree. He went on to earn a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Education\"&gt;Bachelor of Education&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Education\"&gt;Master's Degree in Education Administration&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Moncton\"&gt;University of Moncton&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetts was a longtime member of the &lt;a href=\"Moncton%20City%20Council\"&gt;Moncton City Council&lt;/a&gt;, having been elected in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995 and 1998. He resigned from council upon his election to the legislature in &lt;a href=\"1999%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;. He was re-elected to the legislature in &lt;a href=\"2003%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20Brunswick%20general%20election\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe sits as a &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt;. From 2003-2006, his party held only a one-seat majority which could have collapsed upon the long term absence of any of its members. Betts, who previously had a &lt;a href=\"Coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery\"&gt;quadruple heart bypass&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, was hospitalized in early 2005 with what was thought to be a minor &lt;a href=\"Myocardial%20infarction\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; forcing the government to delay several votes. Betts since returned to work in good health having only suffered severe &lt;a href=\"indigestion\"&gt;indigestion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn December 7, 2005, he was named &lt;a href=\"deputy%20speaker\"&gt;deputy speaker&lt;/a&gt; replacing &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Holder\"&gt;Trevor Holder&lt;/a&gt; who had been elevated to the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Council%20of%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. He ceased being deputy speaker on August 18, 2006 with the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20parliament\"&gt;dissolution of the legislature&lt;/a&gt; for a general election."
