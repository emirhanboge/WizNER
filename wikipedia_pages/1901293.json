    "text": "Vila Nova de Santo Andr\u00e9 (), usually just called Santo Andr\u00e9, is a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; located near the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and belonging to the &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20do%20Cac%C3%A9m\"&gt;Santiago do Cac\u00e9m&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alentejo%20Litoral\"&gt;Alentejo Litoral&lt;/a&gt;, in Portugal. The population in 2011 was 10,647, in an area of 75.11\u00a0km\u00b2.\nIt is a &lt;a href=\"planned%20city\"&gt;planned city&lt;/a&gt; built in the 1980s, to serve the region's oil industry. It is, from all of Santiago do Cac\u00e9m's parishes, the one nearer to the sea and it is surrounded as follows: to the North, by &lt;a href=\"Melides\"&gt;Melides&lt;/a&gt;; to the West, by the Atlantic Ocean; to the East, by Santiago do Cac\u00e9m and Santa Cruz; and to the South, by &lt;a href=\"Sines%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Sines&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the youngest cities in the world with approximately two years as a city and 30 years since it was founded. It is mostly a residential suburb for the industrial city of Sines, from which is about 10 miles.\nOrigin.\nThe choice of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Andrew\"&gt;Saint Andrew&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Patron%20saint\"&gt;patron&lt;/a&gt; of the Church that would give name to the present city (Cidade de Vila Nova de Santo Andr\u00e9) and village (Aldeia de Santo Andr\u00e9), simultaneously, is easily understood: Saint Andrew, brother of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Saint Peter&lt;/a&gt;, was, like him, a &lt;a href=\"fisherman\"&gt;fisherman&lt;/a&gt;, and the first of the two to meet and follow &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Christ&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis life is intimately connected to the sea and &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing culture&lt;/a&gt; as so was that of the people who lived in Aldeia de Santo Andr\u00e9. It was promoted to city (Cidade) in 2003\nHistory.\nSurrounding the first church of Santo Andr\u00e9 the first houses sprung, as is natural, and, as expected, it inhabitants were deeply connected to the religious &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them &lt;a href=\"Historic%20preservation\"&gt;preserved&lt;/a&gt; the church (where an old cemetery use to lay), while others were related to the fishing activities in Santo Andr\u00e9's &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt; and others, still, were economically linked to the region's &lt;a href=\"fair\"&gt;annual fair&lt;/a&gt; (that still exists nowadays).\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Father&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B3nio%20Macedo%20e%20Silva\"&gt;Ant\u00f3nio Macedo e Silva&lt;/a&gt;, a precious source of information about the municipality of Santiago do Cac\u00e9m, Santo Andr\u00e9 was created after other parishes in the municipality, either during the reign of &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;D. Jo\u00e3o I&lt;/a&gt; (1385\u20131433) or during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;D. Duarte&lt;/a&gt; (1433\u20131438). All the rural parishes of this time, except for Santo Andr\u00e9, already existed in the year of 1528.\nEither created in the 15th century or not, it is known for a fact that the parish already existed in the 16th century, with half a dozen houses that lived in the shadow of the Church who had given name to this place and whose population lived of the &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;exploration of the lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fair\"&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"commerce\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the obtained information there was, in the Church, a \"very thick book and very old with a cover of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;sheep wool&lt;/a&gt;\", that certainly must have contained records of &lt;a href=\"baptisms\"&gt;baptisms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deaths\"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"marriages\"&gt;marriages&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other important documents referring to the life of the locals. It is known, however, that the Church was built in 1834.\nSanto Andr\u00e9, first a &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; then a village, started to turn into a meeting point for people of the &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; and people of the sea.\nThe main &lt;a href=\"income\"&gt;income&lt;/a&gt; source was the &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice culture&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"crop%20rotation\"&gt;rice cycle&lt;/a&gt;, that started in 1804, would only end in 1974, when the Gabinete da \u00c1rea de Sines (an organism created on June 19, 1971, that created and managed the Santo Andr\u00e9 as an &lt;a href=\"Urban%20area\"&gt;Urban Center&lt;/a&gt; up until the December 29, 1988, when it was extinct) started a new cycle that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; cycle.\nIn the beginning of 1973, taking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"oil%20exploration\"&gt;oil exploration&lt;/a&gt; in that was taking place in &lt;a href=\"Cabinda%20%28province%29\"&gt;Cabinda&lt;/a&gt; and providing huge amounts of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, the Portuguese &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; decided to create and industrial complex destined to implant the &lt;a href=\"petrochemical\"&gt;petrochemical&lt;/a&gt; exploration in the country, and thus make a stand in the European context where industries of this type were already being developed and used to create &lt;a href=\"wealth\"&gt;wealth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThus, the Urban Center of Santo Andr\u00e9 was born, which would be raised to city on July 1, 2003.\nPrior to this large &lt;a href=\"Eminent%20domain\"&gt;expropriations&lt;/a&gt; took place, and an area (integrated between the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20do%20Cac%C3%A9m\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sines%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Sines&lt;/a&gt;) was delineated for the birth of Santo Andr\u00e9. The industrial platform eventually grew and came to be known as Complexo Petroqu\u00edmico de Sines (Sines' Petrochemical Complex), where the country's largest &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt;, Petrogal (former Petrosul), as well as other important industries (among which a &lt;a href=\"Heat%20engine\"&gt;thermal electrical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"power%20station\"&gt;power station&lt;/a&gt; and the to-be-biggest &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; of Europe), still operates.\nAs there was a preoccupation with &lt;a href=\"Environment%20%28biophysical%29\"&gt;the environment&lt;/a&gt; as well as with the &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; of the industrial complex's workers, Santo Andr\u00e9 was kept at a minimum distance of 10\u00a0km and a &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; that works as a protection from eventual &lt;a href=\"Disaster\"&gt;catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoat of arms.\n&lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;Coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; with two green &lt;a href=\"branch\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;es of &lt;a href=\"orange%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; tree, fruited in orange, crossed (&lt;a href=\"St.%20Andrew\"&gt;St. Andrew&lt;/a&gt;'s cross), with a black &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt; above and three blue and silver &lt;a href=\"water%20waves\"&gt;waves&lt;/a&gt; below. Three-towered &lt;a href=\"mural\"&gt;mural&lt;/a&gt; crown in silver. White scroll with black lettering, in capitals, reading SANTO ANDR\u00c9 - SANTIAGO DO CAC\u00c9M. &lt;a href=\"Flag\"&gt;Flag&lt;/a&gt;: blue, &lt;a href=\"rope\"&gt;rope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tassel\"&gt;tassel&lt;/a&gt;s in silver and blue.\nUrban areas.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 is made up of seven urban areas/zones:\nGeography.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 is located in the &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alentejo\"&gt;Alentejo&lt;/a&gt;, in Portugal, and belongs to the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20do%20Cac%C3%A9m\"&gt;Santiago do Cac\u00e9m&lt;/a&gt;, in the subregion of &lt;a href=\"Alentejo%20Litoral\"&gt;Alentejo Litoral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is very near the sea (2\u00a0km) and also near the Alentejo Southwest and Vicentyne Coast, a protected area. Its climate is &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20climate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt;, with monthly means ranging from 8 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C in the winter and 18 to 28\u00a0\u00b0C in the summer. \nAbsolute extremes are 0\u00a0\u00b0C in winter and 41\u00a0\u00b0C in summer.\nIn terms of precipitation, the climate is somewhat dry, with annual mean of 570\u2013620\u00a0mm falling mostly between November and April.\nThin-&lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; soil can be found in some places and in the city there are a lot of &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine trees&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some extensive sandy beaches within. The extensive &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; that protects Santo Andr\u00e9 is a good example of possible respect between the protection of &lt;a href=\"Environment%20%28biophysical%29\"&gt;the environment&lt;/a&gt; and the industrial development.\nEconomy.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 was built during the 1970s to answer the housing needs of the workers of the industrial complex of Sines. For the next two decades it attracted inhabitants from all over the country and especially people from Portugal's African &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20ex-colonies\"&gt;ex-colonies&lt;/a&gt;. These people were mainly skilled &lt;a href=\"technicians\"&gt;technicians&lt;/a&gt; and people with an average education (9th\u201312th grade) or higher (university). This originated a very young population with a wealth considerably higher than the national average.\nSanto Andr\u00e9's inhabitants enjoy a higher-than-average living quality, for which the beaches, as well as the proximity of the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Park%20of%20Southwest%20Alentejo%20and%20Costa%20Vicentina\"&gt;Natural Park of Southwest Alentejo and Costa Vicentina&lt;/a&gt;, help contribute.\n&lt;a href=\"Sines%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Sines&lt;/a&gt;, only a few minutes from Santo Andr\u00e9, by car, is one of the most dynamic cities of the Alentejo, having kept all its &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; charm. It still represents a main center for development in the province of Alentejo, especially since the University was built in Santo Andr\u00e9.\nBefore Santo Andr\u00e9 was built the locals made their livings from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; (in the sea and in the &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (mainly rice) and &lt;a href=\"fair\"&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNowadays, industry is very important to the economy, giving work to thousands of the people of Santo Andr\u00e9.\n&lt;a href=\"Commerce\"&gt;Local commerce&lt;/a&gt; is also important, but on a smaller scale.\nDemographics.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 occupies an area of 74.32\u00a0km\u00b2 with a population of 10,751 (1991 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;), most of whom are &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of 2005 it was considered to have about 14,000 inhabitants.\nPatrimony.\nNatural.\nBeaches\nThere are &lt;a href=\"beaches\"&gt;beaches&lt;/a&gt; of fine sand.\nThe paths of the \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Coast\"&gt;Blue Coast&lt;/a&gt;\" (as it is classified) seem to characterize the landscape of &lt;a href=\"Alentejo\"&gt;Alentejo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first impression one has (when in Portugal) when talking about the Alentejo is the image of a burning plain (this is one of Portugal's hottest regions). However, there are dozens of kilometers of beach throughout the coast of Alentejo, ranging from &lt;a href=\"River%20Sado%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sado&lt;/a&gt;'s southern margin (in &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B3ia\"&gt;Tr\u00f3ia&lt;/a&gt;) to the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Algarve\"&gt;Algarve&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe giant extension of sand that connects Tr\u00f3ia to Sines, with over 60\u00a0km, has some of the best beaches in Portugal (better &lt;a href=\"water%20quality\"&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt;, cleaner sand and water, as well as good surf spots, than most of the country). They include:\nLagoons\nUp to the 17th century, Santo Andr\u00e9's Lagoon this lagoon was called Lagoa de P\u00eara (\"Pear Lagoon\") and was always communicating with the sea\nNowadays it is kept \"closed\" from contact with the sea most of the time, but sometimes (for health purposes) the water is \"renewed\".\nThe lagoon and the beach are a perfect match when it comes to creating a splendid place on its calm waters, with the green from the wild &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine trees&lt;/a&gt; and low flights of birds their combination makes for a heavenly place to rest, defining the most direct contact in nature-type holidays.\nIt is considered a Wet Spot of International Importance, for there are some bird species that do their nests in its surrounding and for being the biggest lagoon system of all of Alentejo's Coast, offering a landscape of particular interest and great natural conditions, a fundamental aspect of attraction to becoming a great tourist center in a delicate and tranquil environment.\nIts connection to the sea is made once per year - by &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; - in Spring, thus matching the reproduction periods of numerous &lt;a href=\"marine%20biology\"&gt;marine species&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe nature reserve of the Lagoons of Santo Andr\u00e9 and Sancha is one of the most &lt;a href=\"emblematic\"&gt;emblematic&lt;/a&gt; places of Santo Andr\u00e9, one where we can enjoy the variety of fauna and flora of this region, and which is chosen for the protection of a very rich diversity of aquatic birds: &lt;a href=\"ducks\"&gt;ducks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geese\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crane%20%28bird%29\"&gt;cranes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grebes\"&gt;grebes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"curlews\"&gt;curlews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gannets\"&gt;gannets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coots\"&gt;coots&lt;/a&gt;, that used to be hunted every year. It is also the passing ground for many &lt;a href=\"migratory%20birds\"&gt;migratory birds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some &lt;a href=\"otter\"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt; shelters in the Lagoons.\nAmenities.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 also the following amenities:\nSchools.\nSanto Andr\u00e9 has three &lt;a href=\"primary%20schools\"&gt;primary schools&lt;/a&gt;: EB2, EB3 and EB4 and one school with 5th to 6th grade (covering the last two basic education levels).\nIt also has a &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; named Escola Secund\u00e1ria Padre Ant\u00f3nio Macedo (ESPAM) which is an extended secondary school, with students from the 7th grade to the 12th grade.\nSanto Andr\u00e9, although small, contains a University Campus made up by Instituto Superior de Estudos Interculturais e Transdisciplinares, loosely translated as \"&lt;a href=\"Higher%20Education\"&gt;Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Institute\"&gt;Institute&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Intercultural\"&gt;Intercultural&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transdiciplinary\"&gt;Transdiciplinary&lt;/a&gt; Studies\" and has based its teaching policy in the region's characteristics: Sines' industries, the lacks of the Alentejo interior and its potential as a &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourist&lt;/a&gt; region. To find a suitable example between the academic environment and Santo Andr\u00e9's surroundings one needs only to go to the beach after school.\nThis institute's activity was started in the year 2002. The following courses can be studied:\nThe latter one is supported actively by a local Hotel, Vila Park, a project associated with the &lt;a href=\"Piaget%20Institute\"&gt;Piaget Institute&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Higher Education School of Health will be teaching health-related subjects in the future.\nThe campus has &lt;a href=\"laboratory\"&gt;labs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"data%20center\"&gt;computer rooms&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, as well as facilities for sports and services.\nOther facilities include: an &lt;a href=\"amphitheatre\"&gt;amphitheatre&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"auditorium\"&gt;auditorium&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;fitness gym&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"psycomotion%20therapy\"&gt;psycomotion therapy&lt;/a&gt; room and an exposition room."
