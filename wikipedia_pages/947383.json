    "text": "A tensile structure is a &lt;a href=\"construction\"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt; of elements carrying only &lt;a href=\"tension%20%28physics%29\"&gt;tension&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href=\"compression%20%28physical%29\"&gt;compression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bending\"&gt;bending&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"tensile\" should not be confused with &lt;a href=\"tensegrity\"&gt;tensegrity&lt;/a&gt;, which is a structural form with both tension and compression elements.\nTensile structures are the most common type of &lt;a href=\"thin-shell%20structure\"&gt;thin-shell structure&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost tensile structures are supported by some form of compression or bending elements, such as masts (as in &lt;a href=\"The%20O2%20%28London%29\"&gt;The O2&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Dome\"&gt;Millennium Dome&lt;/a&gt;), compression rings or beams.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tension%20fabric%20building\"&gt;tensile membrane structure&lt;/a&gt; is most often used as a &lt;a href=\"roof\"&gt;roof&lt;/a&gt;, as they can economically and attractively span large distances. Tensile membrane structures may also be used as complete buildings, with a few common applications being sports facilities, warehousing and storage buildings, and exhibition venues.\nHistory.\nThis form of construction has only become more rigorously analyzed and widespread in large structures in the latter part of the twentieth century. Tensile structures have long been used in &lt;a href=\"tent\"&gt;tent&lt;/a&gt;s, where the &lt;a href=\"guy%20rope\"&gt;guy rope&lt;/a&gt;s and tent poles provide pre-tension to the fabric and allow it to withstand loads.\nRussian engineer &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Shukhov\"&gt;Vladimir Shukhov&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to develop practical calculations of stresses and deformations of tensile structures, shells and membranes. Shukhov designed eight tensile structures and &lt;a href=\"thin-shell%20structure\"&gt;thin-shell structure&lt;/a&gt;s exhibition pavilions for the &lt;a href=\"Nizhny%20Novgorod%20Fair%20of%201896\"&gt;Nizhny Novgorod Fair of 1896&lt;/a&gt;, covering the area of 27,000 square meters. A more recent large-scale use of a membrane-covered tensile structure is the &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Myer%20Music%20Bowl\"&gt;Sidney Myer Music Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, constructed in 1958.\n&lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Gaudi\"&gt;Antonio Gaudi&lt;/a&gt; used the concept in reverse to create a compression-only structure for the &lt;a href=\"Colonia%20Guell%20Church\"&gt;Colonia Guell Church&lt;/a&gt;. He created a hanging tensile model of the church to calculate the compression forces and to experimentally determine the column and vault geometries.\nThe concept was later championed by &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; architect and engineer &lt;a href=\"Frei%20Otto\"&gt;Frei Otto&lt;/a&gt;, whose first use of the idea was in the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Expo%2067%20pavilions%23National%20pavilions\"&gt;West German pavilion at Expo 67&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal. Otto next used the idea for the roof of the Olympic Stadium for the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1972 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the 1960s, &lt;a href=\"tension%20%28mechanics%29\"&gt;tensile&lt;/a&gt; structures have been promoted by &lt;a href=\"design\"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt;ers and &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Ove%20Arup\"&gt;Ove Arup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buro%20Happold\"&gt;Buro Happold&lt;/a&gt;, Walter Bird of &lt;a href=\"Taiyo%20Kogyo%20Corporation%23Birdair\"&gt;Birdair, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frei%20Otto\"&gt;Frei Otto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud%20Bodo%20Rasch\"&gt;Mahmoud Bodo Rasch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eero%20Saarinen\"&gt;Eero Saarinen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Berger\"&gt;Horst Berger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Nowicki\"&gt;Matthew Nowicki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorg%20Schlaich\"&gt;J\u00f6rg Schlaich&lt;/a&gt;, the duo of &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Goldsmith\"&gt;Nicholas Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Dalland\"&gt;Todd Dalland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"FTL%20Design%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering%20Studio\"&gt;FTL Design &amp; Engineering Studio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Geiger\"&gt;David Geiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteady technological progress has increased the popularity of fabric-roofed structures. The low weight of the materials makes construction easier and cheaper than standard designs, especially when vast open spaces have to be covered.\nCable and membrane structures.\nMembrane materials.\nCommon materials for doubly curved fabric structures are &lt;a href=\"PTFE\"&gt;PTFE&lt;/a&gt;-coated &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polyvinyl%20chloride\"&gt;PVC&lt;/a&gt;-coated &lt;a href=\"polyester\"&gt;polyester&lt;/a&gt;. These are woven materials with different strengths in different directions. The &lt;a href=\"Warp%20%28weaving%29\"&gt;warp&lt;/a&gt; fibers (those fibers which are originally straight\u2014equivalent to the starting fibers on a loom) can carry greater load than the &lt;a href=\"weft\"&gt;weft&lt;/a&gt; or fill fibers, which are woven between the warp fibers.\nOther structures make use of &lt;a href=\"ETFE\"&gt;ETFE&lt;/a&gt; film, either as single layer or in cushion form (which can be inflated, to provide good insulation properties or for aesthetic effect\u2014as on the &lt;a href=\"Allianz%20Arena\"&gt;Allianz Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;). ETFE cushions can also be etched with patterns in order to let different levels of light through when inflated to different levels.\nIn daylight, fabric membrane translucency offers soft diffused naturally lit spaces, while at night, artificial lighting can be used to create an ambient exterior luminescence. They are most often supported by a structural frame as they cannot derive their strength from double curvature.\nCables.\nCables can be of &lt;a href=\"mild%20steel\"&gt;mild steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High-strength%20low-alloy%20steel\"&gt;high strength steel&lt;/a&gt; (drawn carbon steel), &lt;a href=\"stainless%20steel\"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polyester\"&gt;polyester&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aramid\"&gt;aramid fibres&lt;/a&gt;. Structural cables are made of a series of small strands twisted or bound together to form a much larger cable. Steel cables are either spiral strand, where circular rods are twisted together and \"glued\" using a polymer, or locked coil strand, where individual interlocking steel strands form the cable (often with a spiral strand core).\nSpiral strand is slightly weaker than locked coil strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a &lt;a href=\"Young%27s%20modulus\"&gt;Young's modulus&lt;/a&gt;, \"E\" of 150\u00b110\u00a0kN/mm\u00b2 (or 150\u00b110 &lt;a href=\"gigapascal\"&gt;GPa&lt;/a&gt;) and come in sizes from 3 to 90\u00a0mm diameter. Spiral strand suffers from construction stretch, where the strands compact when the cable is loaded. This is normally removed by pre-stretching the cable and cycling the load up and down to 45% of the ultimate tensile load.\nLocked coil strand typically has a Young's Modulus of 160\u00b110\u00a0kN/mm\u00b2 and comes in sizes from 20\u00a0mm to 160\u00a0mm diameter.\nThe properties of the individuals strands of different materials are shown in the table below, where UTS is &lt;a href=\"ultimate%20tensile%20strength\"&gt;ultimate tensile strength&lt;/a&gt;, or the breaking load:\nStructural forms.\n&lt;a href=\"Air-supported%20structure\"&gt;Air-supported structure&lt;/a&gt;s are a form of tensile structures where the fabric envelope is supported by pressurised air only.\nThe majority of fabric structures derive their strength from their doubly curved shape. By forcing the fabric to take on double-curvature the fabric gains sufficient &lt;a href=\"stiffness\"&gt;stiffness&lt;/a&gt; to withstand the loads it is subjected to (for example &lt;a href=\"wind\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; loads). In order to induce an adequately doubly curved form it is most often necessary to pretension or prestress the fabric or its supporting structure.\nForm-finding.\nThe behaviour of structures which depend upon prestress to attain their strength is non-linear, so anything other than a very simple cable has, until the 1990s, been very difficult to design. The most common way to design doubly curved fabric structures was to construct scale models of the final buildings in order to understand their behaviour and to conduct form-finding exercises. Such scale models often employed stocking material or tights, or soap film, as they behave in a very similar way to structural fabrics (they cannot carry shear).\nSoap films have uniform stress in every direction and require a closed boundary to form. They naturally form a minimal surface\u2014the form with minimal area and embodying minimal energy. They are however very difficult to measure. For a large film, its weight can seriously affect its form.\nFor a membrane with curvature in two directions, the basic equation of equilibrium is:\nwhere:\nLines of &lt;a href=\"principal%20curvature\"&gt;principal curvature&lt;/a&gt; have no twist and intersect other lines of principal curvature at right angles.\nA &lt;a href=\"geodesic\"&gt;geodesic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"geodesy\"&gt;geodetic&lt;/a&gt; line is usually the shortest line between two points on the surface. These lines are typically used when defining the cutting pattern seam-lines. This is due to their relative straightness after the planar cloths have been generated, resulting in lower cloth wastage and closer alignment with the fabric weave.\nIn a pre-stressed but unloaded surface \"w\" = 0, so formula_2.\nIn a soap film surface tensions are uniform in both directions, so \"R\"1 = \u2212\"R\"2.\nIt is now possible to use powerful &lt;a href=\"non-linear\"&gt;non-linear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"numerical%20analysis\"&gt;numerical analysis&lt;/a&gt; programs (or &lt;a href=\"finite%20element%20analysis\"&gt;finite element analysis&lt;/a&gt;) to formfind and design fabric and cable structures. The programs must allow for large deflections.\nThe final shape, or form, of a fabric structure depends upon:\nIt is important that the final form will not allow &lt;a href=\"ponding\"&gt;ponding&lt;/a&gt; of water, as this can deform the membrane and lead to local failure or progressive failure of the entire structure.\nSnow loading can be a serious problem for membrane structure, as the snow often will not flow off the structure as water will. For example, this has in the past caused the (temporary) collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome\"&gt;Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome&lt;/a&gt;, an air-inflated structure in &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. Some structures prone to &lt;a href=\"ponding\"&gt;ponding&lt;/a&gt; use heating to melt snow which settles on them.\nThere are many different doubly curved forms, many of which have special mathematical properties. The most basic doubly curved from is the saddle shape, which can be a &lt;a href=\"hyperbolic%20paraboloid\"&gt;hyperbolic paraboloid&lt;/a&gt; (not all saddle shapes are hyperbolic paraboloids). This is a double &lt;a href=\"ruled%20surface\"&gt;ruled surface&lt;/a&gt; and is often used in both in lightweight shell structures (see &lt;a href=\"hyperboloid%20structures\"&gt;hyperboloid structures&lt;/a&gt;). True ruled surfaces are rarely found in tensile structures. Other forms are &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anticlastic\"&gt;anticlastic&lt;/a&gt; saddles, various radial, conical tent forms and any combination of them.\nPretension.\nPretension is tension artificially induced in the structural elements in addition to any self-weight or imposed loads they may carry. It is used to ensure that the normally very flexible structural elements remain stiff under all possible loads.\nA day to day example of pretension is a shelving unit supported by wires running from floor to ceiling. The wires hold the shelves in place because they are tensioned \u2013 if the wires were slack the system would not work.\nPretension can be applied to a membrane by stretching it from its edges or by pretensioning cables which support it and hence changing its shape. The level of pretension applied determines the shape of a membrane structure.\nAlternative form-finding approach.\nThe alternative approximated approach to the form-finding problem solution is based on the total energy balance of a grid-nodal system. Due to its physical meaning this approach is called the &lt;a href=\"Stretched%20grid%20method\"&gt;Stretched Grid Method (SGM)&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimple mathematics of cables.\nTransversely and uniformly loaded cable.\nA uniformly loaded cable spanning between two supports forms a curve intermediate between a &lt;a href=\"catenary\"&gt;catenary&lt;/a&gt; curve and a &lt;a href=\"parabola\"&gt;parabola&lt;/a&gt;. The simplifying assumption can be made that it approximates a circular arc (of radius \"R\").\nBy &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20equilibrium\"&gt;equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe horizontal and vertical reactions :\nBy &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe length of the cable:\nThe tension in the cable:\nBy substitution:\nThe tension is also equal to:\nThe extension of the cable upon being loaded is (from &lt;a href=\"Hooke%27s%20Law\"&gt;Hooke's Law&lt;/a&gt;, where the axial stiffness, \"k,\" is equal to formula_9):\nwhere \"E\" is the &lt;a href=\"Young%27s%20modulus\"&gt;Young's modulus&lt;/a&gt; of the cable and \"A\" is its cross-sectional &lt;a href=\"area\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf an initial pretension, formula_11 is added to the cable, the extension becomes:\nCombining the above equations gives:\nBy plotting the left hand side of this equation against \"T,\" and plotting the right hand side on the same axes, also against \"T,\" the intersection will give the actual equilibrium tension in the cable for a given loading \"w\" and a given pretension formula_11.\nCable with central point load.\nA similar solution to that above can be derived where:\nBy equilibrium:\nBy geometry:\nThis gives the following relationship:\nAs before, plotting the left hand side and right hand side of the equation against the tension, \"T,\" will give the equilibrium tension for a given pretension, formula_11 and load, \"W\".\nTensioned cable oscillations.\nThe fundamental &lt;a href=\"natural%20frequency\"&gt;natural frequency&lt;/a&gt;, \"f\"1 of tensioned cables is given by:\nwhere \"T\" = tension in &lt;a href=\"newton%20%28unit%29\"&gt;newton&lt;/a&gt;s, \"m\" = &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; in kilograms and \"L\" = span length.\nClassification numbers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Construction%20Specifications%20Institute\"&gt;Construction Specifications Institute&lt;/a&gt; (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC), &lt;a href=\"MasterFormat\"&gt;MasterFormat&lt;/a&gt; 2018 Edition, Division 05 and 13:\nCSI/CSC &lt;a href=\"MasterFormat\"&gt;MasterFormat&lt;/a&gt; 1995 Edition:"
