    "text": "Stanford Stadium is an outdoor athletic &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stanford%2C%20California\"&gt;Stanford, California&lt;/a&gt;, on the campus of &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Cardinal%20football\"&gt;Stanford Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; team as well as the site of the university's commencement exercises. It opened in &lt;a href=\"1921%20Stanford%20football%20team\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt; stadium, an earthen horseshoe with wooden bleacher seating and flooring upon a steel frame. Its original &lt;a href=\"seating%20capacity\"&gt;seating capacity&lt;/a&gt; was 60,000, which grew to 89,000 by 1927 as a nearly enclosed bowl.\nImmediately following the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Stanford%20Cardinal%20football%20team\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; season, the stadium was demolished and rebuilt as a dual-deck concrete structure, without a track. Today, it seats 50,424. The natural grass playing field runs NW-SE, at an approximate &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history.\nStanford Stadium was built in five months in 1921 and opened its gates on November 19, replacing &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Field\"&gt;Stanford Field&lt;/a&gt;. The first game was against rival &lt;a href=\"California%20Golden%20Bears%20football\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated Stanford 42\u20137 in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Game%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Big Game&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Seating%20capacity\"&gt;Seating capacity&lt;/a&gt; was originally 60,000, with a 66-row, U-Shaped structure second only to the &lt;a href=\"Yale%20Bowl\"&gt;Yale Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in size at the time.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1925%20Stanford%20football%20team\"&gt;1925&lt;/a&gt;, 10,200 seats were added to the stadium, nearly enclosing the horseshoe while still keeping the overall height of the facility intact. In &lt;a href=\"1927%20Stanford%20football%20team\"&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt;, fourteen additional rows of seating were added, increasing the stadium to its maximum capacity of 85,500, with eighty rows of seating. In 1932, the stadium hosted the &lt;a href=\"USA%20Outdoor%20Track%20and%20Field%20Championships\"&gt;USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships&lt;/a&gt;. In 1935, Stanford Stadium set a record (for the time) for single-game attendance, with 94,000 spectators filling it for a 13\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"California%20Golden%20Bears%20football\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.\nNFL.\nIn January 1985, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XIX\"&gt;Super Bowl XIX&lt;/a&gt; was held in Stanford Stadium, with the Bay Area's own &lt;a href=\"1984%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; defeating the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, 38\u201316.\nAs of 2021, Stanford Stadium is one of two venues (the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; being the other) to host a Super Bowl without previously serving as the home stadium of a &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) or &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League\"&gt;American Football League&lt;/a&gt; (AFL) team, and Super Bowl XIX is one of only two Super Bowls where the host region saw its team win (the other being &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20LV\"&gt;Super Bowl LV&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; were the first team to play and win a Super Bowl at their home stadium).\nOn October 22, &lt;a href=\"1989%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1989%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; played a home game at the stadium against the &lt;a href=\"1989%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Candlestick%20Park\"&gt;Candlestick Park&lt;/a&gt; had suffered serious damage following the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake\"&gt;Loma Prieta earthquake&lt;/a&gt; five days earlier.\nSoccer.\nThe stadium has hosted &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201984%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; matches for the &lt;a href=\"1984%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1984 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; as one of three venues outside southern California for that Olympics, the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"1999%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1999 FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Earthquakes\"&gt;San Jose Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; have hosted one match at the stadium each year since 2011. The first year's opponent was the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Red%20Bulls\"&gt;New York Red Bulls&lt;/a&gt;; since 2012, the Earthquakes have used the stadium to host their home leg of the &lt;a href=\"California%20Cl%C3%A1sico\"&gt;California Cl\u00e1sico&lt;/a&gt; versus the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy\"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther notable events.\nOther high-profile events hosted at Stanford Stadium include &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Hoover\"&gt;Herbert Hoover&lt;/a&gt;'s acceptance speech for the &lt;a href=\"1928%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1928&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1928%20Republican%20National%20Convention\"&gt;Republican Presidential nomination&lt;/a&gt; and the 1962 edition of the long-running (1958\u20131985) series of track meets between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nModern renovations.\nThe stadium has gone a number of significant renovations since the 1920s. In 1960, a press box was added, while the first, and last synthetic &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; track was installed in 1978 (replacing the cinder track that had been used for many years).\nIn 1985, prior to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XIX\"&gt;Super Bowl XIX&lt;/a&gt;, the press box was renovated, new locker rooms were installed, a ticket complex and dressing room for game officials were added, and the number of restrooms were increased.\nIn 1994, prior to the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the lower level of the press box was expanded and aluminum benches were installed throughout the stadium. The crown of the playing surface was also reduced.\nIn 1995, a $10 million gift from Los Angeles insurance executive and 1935 Stanford graduate Louis W. Foster enabled further updates to the stadium, including widening the concourse, improving the restrooms, and replacing the remaining wooden seats. In honor of his gift, Stanford named the playing surface the Louis W. Foster Family Field at Stanford Stadium.\n2005\u20132006 demolition and reconstruction.\nIn June 2005, the university Board of Trustees authorized plans for the stadium's demolition and reconstruction that would remove the track, reduce the stadium capacity, and bring it up to date with present standards for sporting venues. Various justifications for the renovation included poor sightlines in the existing stadium (rendering the bottom 14 rows unusable), long stairways, and lack of adequate restroom facilities. The track around the stadium had previously created a large distance between the field and the spectators.\nThe capacity of the new stadium was set to be approximately 50,000 seats made by Ducharme Seating. The reduction in capacity was a strategic decision by Stanford's Athletics Program to boost season ticket sales and create a more intimate playing atmosphere without sacrificing the ability to host large world-class events, such as the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the future. This was partially the result of &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20bid%20for%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;San Francisco's failure to secure a bid&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, which would have featured a renovated Stanford Stadium as the main Olympic Venue.\nConstruction began minutes after the Cardinal's last home game of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; football season, a 38\u201331 loss to &lt;a href=\"2005%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; on November 26. Bulldozers began tearing out the natural field turf in a ceremony held while attendees were still in the stadium for the game. Construction proceeded quickly through the winter and spring with the goal of opening in time for Stanford's game against &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20State%20Spartans%20football\"&gt;San Jose State&lt;/a&gt; on September 9, 2006, but the game had to be relocated to San Jose State's &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20Stadium%20%28San%20Jose%29\"&gt;Spartan Stadium&lt;/a&gt; due to an unusually wet winter and resulting construction delays. In the summer of 2006, a construction worker fell to his death.\nThe stadium opened on September 16, &lt;a href=\"2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; with Stanford losing to &lt;a href=\"Navy%20Midshipmen%20football\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; 37\u20139. The &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Band\"&gt;Stanford Band&lt;/a&gt; was not present at the stadium opening since they were not permitted to play at any athletic events in the month of September due to accusations of vandalism to a temporary trailer which formerly served as their rehearsal facility. Instead, the Navy band performed at halftime and played throughout the game.\nThe facility occupies , with a footprint of ., a playing surface below ground level, and is now a rectangle shape stadium. The stadium has 43 rows on the sides, 22 rows on the endzones, and 30 rows below the skybox. The skybox also has 437 spectator seats, more than double the number of the previous press box.\nIn 2013, Stanford upgraded their scoreboards with twin &lt;a href=\"high-definition%20video\"&gt;HD video&lt;/a&gt; boards. Also, a ribbon board was added, which displays out-of-town scores and real-time statistics."
