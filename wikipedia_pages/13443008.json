    "text": "Henry J. Newbould (1861 \u2013 April 1928, born in &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;) was an English &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager who managed &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore becoming a manager, Newbould combined a job at an iron foundry with playing football, playing as an outside right. &lt;a href=\"Derby%20St%20Luke%27s%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby St. Luke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; were among his clubs. He later trained as an accountant.\nIn 1900 he became the first person to hold the position of manager at Derby County, stepping up from his previous position as assistant secretary. Prior to his appointment, the Derby team was selected by committee. Newbould's Derby reached the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; final in 1903, but lost 6\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Bury%20F.C.\"&gt;Bury&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. In 1906, financial pressures led Derby's directors to sell &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bloomer\"&gt;Steve Bloomer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt;. Newbould disagreed with the decision, and left the club at the end of the season to take up the managerial position at Manchester City.\nNewbould joined Manchester City with the club in turmoil. A scandal concerning illegal payments to players had resulted in the suspension of seventeen players, leaving a squad of only eleven players. Newbould was tasked with both rebuilding the team and proving the club's accounts were being run in a lawful manner. Newbould's first match was an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Woolwich Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Road%20Football%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyde Road&lt;/a&gt;. The makeshift side struggled on a hot day, losing three players to sunstroke by half-time. By the end of the match City were down to just six players, the final score was 4\u20131 to Arsenal. His second match saw an even heavier defeat, 9\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;, a scoreline which remains a club record defeat more than a century later. Over the course of the season Newbould's City gradually recovered, winning the first top-flight &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20derby\"&gt;Manchester derby&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130, but only finished two places above the relegation zone. The following season, he guided Manchester City to a third-place finish, but performances were inconsistent, and in the &lt;a href=\"1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1908\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt; the club were &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegated&lt;/a&gt;. Newbould remained manager after relegation and led City to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; championship at the first attempt. After two consecutive bottom half Division One finishes, Newbould left the club.\nAfter leaving City he had a brief spell as a coach at &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Akademisk%20Boldklub\"&gt;Akademisk Boldklub&lt;/a&gt; before becoming secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association\"&gt;Players' Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1913, a position he held until his death in 1928."
