    "text": "Eight &lt;a href=\"malt%20whisky\"&gt;malt whisky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"distillery\"&gt;distilleries&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20%28profession%29\"&gt;cooperage&lt;/a&gt; form the Malt Whisky Trail in Scotland's &lt;a href=\"Strathspey%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Speyside&lt;/a&gt;. Seven of the eight distilleries are in production and operational, whilst the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Dhu%20distillery\"&gt;Dallas Dhu distillery&lt;/a&gt; is a historic distillery. The Malt Whisky Trail is a local &lt;a href=\"theme%20route\"&gt;theme route&lt;/a&gt; marketing initiative, established to promote the region's whisky-related &lt;a href=\"cultural%20heritage\"&gt;cultural heritage&lt;/a&gt; and encourage tourism.\nOver half of Scotland's malt whisky distilleries are in Speyside, not all of which are open to the public. The &lt;a href=\"heritage%20trail\"&gt;heritage trail&lt;/a&gt; consists of the following &lt;a href=\"Speyside%20single%20malt\"&gt;Speyside single malt&lt;/a&gt; distilleries and a cooperage.\nA 2012 BBC article recommends a leisurely tour. \"Though the distilleries are fairly close together, leisurely travellers may want to dedicate a few days to taking in the distinct traditions and lore at each stop."
