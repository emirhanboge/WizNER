    "text": "Lumprice () is a &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt; dish that was introduced by the country's &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Burghers\"&gt;Dutch Burgher&lt;/a&gt; population. Lumprice is an Anglicised derivative of the Dutch word \"lomprijst\", which loosely translated means a packet or lump of rice.\nHistory.\nFrom 1658 until 1796, Sri Lanka was under &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20people\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; rule. The &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Burghers\"&gt;Dutch Burghers&lt;/a&gt; (an ethnic group of mixed Dutch, &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Burghers\"&gt;Portuguese Burghers&lt;/a&gt; and Sri Lankan descent) came up with this delicacy. The dish itself is not a native dish to the Netherlands but is based on the &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20cuisine\"&gt;Javanese meal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lemper\"&gt;Lemper&lt;/a&gt;. Lemper is a snack consisting of shredded seasoned meat, &lt;a href=\"glutinous%20rice\"&gt;glutinous rice&lt;/a&gt; wrapped in a banana leaf. The Dutch in &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Ceylon\"&gt;Dutch Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; are likely to have adapted this dish from the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; in the early 16th Century.\nOne of the first literary mentions of Lamprais was in Hilda Deutrom's \"Ceylon Daily News Cookery Book\", published in 1929.\nComposition.\nIt consists of two special &lt;a href=\"curries\"&gt;curries&lt;/a&gt; (a three meat curry, often including beef, pork and chicken - and ash &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20banana\"&gt;plantain&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"aubergine\"&gt;aubergine&lt;/a&gt;), seeni &lt;a href=\"Sambal%23Sri%20Lankan%20sambal\"&gt;sambal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shrimp%20paste\"&gt;belacan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frikadeller\"&gt;frikadeller&lt;/a&gt; meatballs and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; boiled in stock, all of which is wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Banana%20leaf\"&gt;banana leaves&lt;/a&gt; and baked in an oven. The rice is made by frying raw short grain rice with onions and spices in butter or ghee and then cooking it in a meat stock. A hard boiled egg which has been deep-fried is also a common, but non-traditional, addition.\nThe traditional recipe always contains three meat items however modern versions can include just a single meat, such as fish or chicken or as a vegetarian version."
