    "text": "USFS \"Murre was an American &lt;a href=\"fishery\"&gt;fishery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patrol%20vessel\"&gt;patrol vessel&lt;/a&gt; that served in the waters of &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Alaska\"&gt;Southeast Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. She was in commission in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Fisheries\"&gt;United States Bureau of Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; fleet from 1917 to 1940 and, as US FWS \"Murre in the U.S. &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; fleet from 1940 to 1942. \"Murre\" and her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; were the first vessels ever constructed for fisheries enforcement duties in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\nIn 1916, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; appropriated $10,000 to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Fisheries\"&gt;United States Bureau of Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; (BOF) for the construction of two &lt;a href=\"fishery\"&gt;fishery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patrol%20vessel\"&gt;patrol vessel&lt;/a&gt;s for service in the waters of &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Alaska\"&gt;Southeast Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20C.%20Erismann\"&gt;Martin C. Erismann&lt;/a&gt; designed the vessels as identical &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s and patterned them after the highly seaworthy design of &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"purse%20seiner\"&gt;purse seiner&lt;/a&gt;s. Built out of &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20fir\"&gt;Douglas fir&lt;/a&gt;, they had a raised &lt;a href=\"Deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; forward of the &lt;a href=\"pilot%20house\"&gt;pilot house&lt;/a&gt; that dropped moving aft, a raised &lt;a href=\"deck%20house\"&gt;deck house&lt;/a&gt; amidships which had an overhanging roof that covered the deck, and a small afterdeck at the &lt;a href=\"Stern%20%28ship%29\"&gt;stern&lt;/a&gt;. The sides extended upward to create the walls of the after &lt;a href=\"Cabin%20%28ship%29\"&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt;. Each boat had a &lt;a href=\"Frisco%20Standard\"&gt;Frisco Standard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gasoline%20engine\"&gt;gasoline engine&lt;/a&gt; and comfortable accommodations for two fishery agents and a crew of three.\nConstruction bids for the two vessels opened in &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, on 5 December 1916 and the project attracted seven bids. Ultimately, the BOF signed a contract to build the vessels with the &lt;a href=\"Elliott%20Bay%20Yacht%20and%20Engine%20Company\"&gt;Elliott Bay Yacht and Engine Company&lt;/a&gt; of Seattle. Construction began immediately. After the two boats were completed and inspected, the BOF accepted both boats, USFS \"Murre\" and , on 10 May 1917. The total cost of designing, building, and inspecting the two boats came to US$9,702.70. They were the first vessels ever constructed for fisheries enforcement duties in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperational history.\nThe BOF commissioned both \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" in the summer of 1917. \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" departed Seattle on 7 July 1917 bound for &lt;a href=\"Wrangell%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Wrangell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Alaska\"&gt;Territory of Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. After they arrived, they took up their patrol duties in the waters of Southeast Alaska.\nOn 25 October 1918, the &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Passenger%20ship\"&gt;passenger liner&lt;/a&gt; sank with the loss of all 343 people on board after grounding on &lt;a href=\"Vanderbilt%20Reef\"&gt;Vanderbilt Reef&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lynn%20Canal\"&gt;Lynn Canal&lt;/a&gt; near Juneau; it was the worst maritime disaster in the combined history of Alaska and &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. \"Murre\" joined \"Auklet\" and the BOF fishery patrol vessel in a fruitless search for survivors that lasted into November 1918.\nIn addition to performing their primary duty of fishery patrols in the waters of Southeast Alaska, \"Auklet\" and \"Murre\" often engaged in other activities. They assisted the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20War\"&gt;United States Department of War&lt;/a&gt; in inspecting active and abandoned &lt;a href=\"fish%20trap\"&gt;fish trap&lt;/a&gt;s as possible navigational obstructions, and took part in routine stream improvements, which involved the removal of impediments to salmon \u2013 such as &lt;a href=\"log%20jam\"&gt;log jam&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beaver%20dam\"&gt;beaver dam&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 as they ascended to their &lt;a href=\"spawning\"&gt;spawning&lt;/a&gt; grounds.\nIn 1919\u20131920, the BOF loaned \"Murre\" to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. On 3 December 1919, a fire broke out in her &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; while she was moored at &lt;a href=\"Hoonah%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Hoonah&lt;/a&gt;, Alaska, with her crew sleeping on board. The crew awoke and extinguished it, but not before it caused US$600 damage to the ship and considerable property loss to the crew. While conducting &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; work for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;United States Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Education\"&gt;Bureau of Education&lt;/a&gt;, \"Murre\" struck a rock in Alaska's &lt;a href=\"Keku%20Strait\"&gt;Keku Strait&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 1920 and was beached to prevent her from sinking. \"Auklet\" arrived on the scene and towed \"Murre\" to Wrangell for repairs, which cost more than US$1,600. Investigations into both incidents found no fault on the part of \"Murre\"s &lt;a href=\"Sea%20captain\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; or crew.\nIn September 1920, \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" conducted stream-marking. Over the winter of 1920\u20131921, the BOF loaned \"Murre\" to the Bureau of Education and to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice\"&gt;United States Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1921 \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" began a program of annual springtime patrolling of &lt;a href=\"Pinniped\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;ing grounds near &lt;a href=\"Sitka%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Sitka&lt;/a&gt;, Territory of Alaska, during &lt;a href=\"fur%20seal\"&gt;fur seal&lt;/a&gt; migrations. By 1922, both \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" had had their original engines replaced with heavier, Frisco Standard gasoline engines that gave them additional power they needed to deal with the high winds and seas they frequently encountered in the waters of the Territory of Alaska. \nIn the spring of 1924, \"Murre\" briefly assisted the U.S. Department of War in looking for improper lighting on unattended fish traps and structures that could pose hazards to navigation in navigable waters in Alaska. In February 1928, \"Murre\" and \"Auklet\" both had &lt;a href=\"water%20heating\"&gt;water heating&lt;/a&gt; systems installed at Juneau, and later in 1928 each boat had her galley enlarged to increase the comfort of crew and passengers.\nIn 1930, \"Murre\" supported a project by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Willis%20H.%20Rich\"&gt;Willis H. Rich&lt;/a&gt; to tag &lt;a href=\"pink%20salmon\"&gt;pink salmon&lt;/a&gt; and study salmon migration routes in Alaska. In March 1932, she assisted B.\u00a0E.\u00a0Smith of Ketchikan, Alaska, in transporting approximately 300,000 Japanese seed &lt;a href=\"oyster\"&gt;oyster&lt;/a&gt;s to Southeast Alaska and planting them there in the hope of establishing a new food source. In 1936, she again supported Rich's salmon project.\nIn addition to her Southeast Alaska patrol duties, \"Murre\" occasionally patrolled in other waters of the Territory of Alaska. In the mid-1930s, she patrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Katalla%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Katalla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20William%20Sound\"&gt;Prince William Sound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Seward%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Seward&lt;/a&gt; areas.\nIn 1937, \"Murre\" was on a voyage from Seattle to Alaska when her &lt;a href=\"crankshaft\"&gt;crankshaft&lt;/a&gt; broke. The BOF vessel rendezvoused with her and towed her into port.\nIn 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;United States Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, \"Murre\" became part of the fleet of the new FWS as US FWS \"Murre\" in 1940.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, \"Murre\" reportedly came under &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; control in 1942 for war service."
