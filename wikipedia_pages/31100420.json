    "title": "Argentines of European descent",
    "text": "European Argentines belong to several communities which trace their origins to various migrations from Europe and which have contributed to the country's cultural and demographic variety. They are the descendants of colonists from Spain during the colonial period prior to 1810, or in the majority of cases, of Spanish, Italians, French, Russians and other Europeans who arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;great immigration wave&lt;/a&gt; from the mid 19th to the mid 20th centuries, and who largely intermarried among their many nationalities during and after this wave. No recent Argentine census has included comprehensive questions on ethnicity, although numerous studies have determined that European Argentinians have been a majority in the country since 1914.\nDistribution.\nEuropean Argentinians may live in any part of the country, though their proportion varies according to region. Due to the fact that the main entry point for European immigrants was the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Port of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, they settled mainly in the central-eastern region known as the &lt;a href=\"Pampas\"&gt;Pampas&lt;/a&gt; (the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20Province\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20Province%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entre%20R%C3%ADos%20Province\"&gt;Entre R\u00edos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20Pampa%20Province\"&gt;La Pampa&lt;/a&gt;), Their presence in the northern region is less evident due to several reasons: it was the most densely populated region of the country (mainly by &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mestizo\"&gt;Mestizo&lt;/a&gt; people) until the immigratory wave of 1857 to 1940, and it was the area where the European newcomers settled the least. During the last decades, due to internal migration from these northern provinces and due to immigration especially from &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Per%C3%BA\"&gt;Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; (which have Amerindian and Mestizo majorities), the percentage of European Argentines in certain areas of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Greater Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, and the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Salta%20Province\"&gt;Salta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jujuy%20Province\"&gt;Jujuy&lt;/a&gt; has significantly decreased as well.\nEstimates.\nNeither official census data nor statistically significant studies exist on the precise amount or percentage of Argentines of European descent today. The Argentine government recognizes the different communities, but Argentina's National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (&lt;a href=\"INDEC\"&gt;INDEC&lt;/a&gt;) does not conduct ethnic/racial censuses, nor includes questions about ethnicity. The Census conducted on 27 October 2010, did include questions on &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;Indigenous peoples&lt;/a&gt; (complementing the survey performed in 2005) and on &lt;a href=\"Afro-Argentine\"&gt;Afro-descendants&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenetic research.\nIt is estimated that more than 25\u00a0million Argentines (about 63%) have at least one Italian forefather.\nAnother study of the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The results of this study in which &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals had at least one Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;University of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"La%20Plata\"&gt;La Plata&lt;/a&gt;. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it must be said here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the &lt;a href=\"mtDNA\"&gt;mtDNA&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=\"Y-Chromosome\"&gt;Y-Chromosome&lt;/a&gt;, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.\nA separate genetic study on genic admixture was conducted by Argentine and French scientists from multiple academic and scientific institutions (CONICET, UBA, Centre d'anthropologie de Toulouse). This study showed that the average contribution to Argentine ancestry was 79.9% &lt;a href=\"European%20ethnic%20groups\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt;, 15.8% Amerindian and 4.3% African. Another similar study was conducted in 2006, and its results were also similar. A team led by Michael F. Seldin from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California\"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt;, with members of scientific institutes from Argentina, the United States, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed samples from 94 individuals and concluded that the average genetic structure of the Argentine population contains a 78.1% European contribution, 19.4% Amerindian contribution and 2.5% African contribution (using the &lt;a href=\"Bayesian%20algorithm\"&gt;Bayesian algorithm&lt;/a&gt;).\nA team led by Daniel Corach conducted a new study in 2009, analyzing 246 samples from eight provinces and three different regions of the country. The results were as follows: the analysis of &lt;a href=\"Y-Chromosome\"&gt;Y-Chromosome&lt;/a&gt; DNA revealed a 94.1% of European contribution (a little higher than the 90% of the 2005 study), and only 4.9% and 0.9% of Native American and Black African contribution, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Mitochondrial%20DNA\"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA&lt;/a&gt; analysis again showed a great Amerindian contribution by maternal lineage, at 53.7%, with 44.3% of European contribution, and a 2% African contribution. The study of 24 &lt;a href=\"Autosomal%20DNA\"&gt;autosomal&lt;/a&gt; markers also proved a large European contribution of 78.5%, against 17.3% of Amerindian and 4.2% Black African contributions. The samples were compared with three assumed parental populations, and the MDS analysis plot resulting showed that \"most of the Argentinean samples clustered with or closest to Europeans, some appeared between Europeans and Native Americans indicating some degree of genetic admixture between these two groups, three samples clustered close to Native Americans, and no Argentinean sampled appeared close to Africans\".\nHistory.\nColonial and post-independence period.\nThe presence of &lt;a href=\"Ethnography%20of%20Argentina%23Ethnic%20groups\"&gt;European people&lt;/a&gt; in the Argentine territory began in 1516, when Spanish &lt;a href=\"Conquistador\"&gt;Conquistador&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Juan%20D%C3%ADaz%20de%20Sol%C3%ADs\"&gt;Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; explored the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata\"&gt;R\u00edo de la Plata&lt;/a&gt;. In 1527, &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Cabot%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Sebastian Cabot&lt;/a&gt; founded the fort of \"Sancti Spiritus\", near &lt;a href=\"Coronda\"&gt;Coronda&lt;/a&gt;, Santa Fe; this was the first Spanish settlement on Argentine soil. The process of Spanish occupation continued with expeditions coming from &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Peru\"&gt;Upper Peru&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;), that founded &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20del%20Estero\"&gt;Santiago del Estero&lt;/a&gt; in 1553, &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; in 1565 and &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; in 1573, and from &lt;a href=\"Captaincy%20General%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, which founded &lt;a href=\"Mendoza%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Mendoza&lt;/a&gt; in 1561 and &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt; in 1562. Other Spanish expeditions founded the cities of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt; (1573), &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; (1580), and &lt;a href=\"Corrientes\"&gt;Corrientes&lt;/a&gt; (1588).\nIt was not until the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Viceroyalty%20of%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata\"&gt;Viceroyalty of R\u00edo de la Plata&lt;/a&gt; in 1776, that the first censuses with classification into \"&lt;a href=\"casta\"&gt;casta&lt;/a&gt;s\" were conducted. The 1778 Census ordered by &lt;a href=\"viceroy\"&gt;viceroy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20V%C3%A9rtiz%20y%20Salcedo\"&gt;Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz&lt;/a&gt; in Buenos Aires revealed that, of a total population of 37,130 inhabitants, the Spaniards and &lt;a href=\"Criollo%20people\"&gt;Criollos&lt;/a&gt; numbered 25,451, or 68.55% of the total. Another census carried out in the Corregimiento de &lt;a href=\"Cuyo%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Cuyo&lt;/a&gt; in 1777 showed that the Spaniards and Criollos numbered 4,491 (or 51.24%) out of a population of 8,765 inhabitants. In &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; (city and countryside) the Spanish/Criollo people comprised 39.36% (about 14,170) of 36,000 inhabitants.\nAccording to data from the Argentine government in 1810, about 6,000 Spanish lived in the territory of the United Provinces of R\u00edo de la Plata Spanish, of a total population of around 700,000 inhabitants. This small number indicates that the presence of people with European ancestors was very small, and a large number of Criollos were mixed with indigenous and African mothers, although the fact was often hidden; in this regard, for example, according to researcher &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Ignacio%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Hamilton\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Garc\u00eda Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; the Liberator, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20de%20San%20Mart%C3%ADn\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, would be mestizo.\nNevertheless, these censuses were generally restricted to the cities and the surrounding rural areas, so little is known about the racial composition of large areas of the Viceroyalty, though it is supposed that Spaniards and Criollos were always a minority, with the other \"castas\" comprising the majority. It is worth noting that, since a person who was classified as \"Peninsular\" or \"Criollo\" had access to more privileges in the colonial society, many &lt;a href=\"Castizo\"&gt;Castizo&lt;/a&gt;s (resulting from the union of a Spanish and a \"mestizo\") purchased their \"&lt;a href=\"limpieza%20de%20sangre\"&gt;limpieza de sangre&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"purity of blood\").\nAlthough being a minority in demographics terms, the Criollo people played a leading role in the &lt;a href=\"May%20Revolution\"&gt;May Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1810, as well as in the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;independence of Argentina&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1816. Argentine national heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Belgrano\"&gt;Manuel Belgrano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Pueyrred%C3%B3n\"&gt;Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, military men as &lt;a href=\"Cornelio%20Saavedra\"&gt;Cornelio Saavedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Alvear\"&gt;Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear&lt;/a&gt;, and politicians as &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Paso\"&gt;Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Moreno\"&gt;Mariano Moreno&lt;/a&gt; were mostly Criollos of Spanish, Italian or French descent. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Triumvirate%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;Second Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Asamblea%20del%20A%C3%B1o%20XIII\"&gt;1813 assembly&lt;/a&gt; enacted laws encouraging immigration, and instituted advertising campaigns and contract work programs among prospective immigrants in Europe.\nThe Minister of Government of Buenos Aires Province, &lt;a href=\"Bernardino%20Rivadavia\"&gt;Bernardino Rivadavia&lt;/a&gt;, established the Immigration Commission in 1824. He appointed Ventura Arzac to conduct a new Census in the city, and it showed these results: the city had 55,416 inhabitants, of which 40,000 were of European descent (about 72.2%); of this total of Whites, a 90% were Criollos, a 5% were Spaniards, and the other 5% were from other European nations.\nAfter the wars for independence, a long period of &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Civil%20War\"&gt;internal struggle&lt;/a&gt; followed. During the period between 1826 and 1852, some Europeans settled in the country as well -sometimes hired by the local governments. Notable among them, &lt;a href=\"Savoy\"&gt;Savoy&lt;/a&gt;an lithographer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Pellegrini\"&gt;Charles Pellegrini&lt;/a&gt; (President &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Pellegrini\"&gt;Carlos Pellegrini&lt;/a&gt;'s father) and his wife Maria Bevans, &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Neapolitan&lt;/a&gt; journalist Pedro de Angelis, and German physician/zoologist &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Burmeister\"&gt;Hermann Burmeister&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this long conflict, there were neither economic resources nor political stability to carry out any census until the 1850s, when some provincial censuses were organized. These censuses did not continue the classification into \"castas\" typical of the pre-independence period.\nThe administration of Governor &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Manuel%20de%20Rosas\"&gt;Juan Manuel de Rosas&lt;/a&gt;, who had been given the &lt;a href=\"sum%20of%20public%20power\"&gt;sum of public power&lt;/a&gt; by other governors in the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Confederation\"&gt;Argentine Confederation&lt;/a&gt;, maintained Rivadavia' Immigration Commission, which continued to advertise &lt;a href=\"Agricultural%20colonies%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;Agricultural colonies in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; among prospective European immigrants. Following Rosas' overthrow by &lt;a href=\"Entre%20R%C3%ADos%20Province\"&gt;Entre R\u00edos Province&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href=\"Justo%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urquiza\"&gt;Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza&lt;/a&gt;, jurist and legal scholar &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Bautista%20Alberdi\"&gt;Juan Bautista Alberdi&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned to prepare a draft for a new Constitution. His outline, \"Bases and Starting Points for the Political Organization of the Argentine Republic\", called the Federal Government to \"promote European immigration,\" and this policy would be included as Article 25 of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Constitution\"&gt;Argentine Constitution&lt;/a&gt; of 1853.\nThe first post-independence census conducted in Buenos Aires took place in 1855; it showed that there were 26,149 European inhabitants in the city. Among the nationals there is no distinction of race, but it does distinguish literates from illiterates; at that time formal education was a privilege almost exclusive for the upper sectors of society, who were predominantly of European descent. Including European residents and the 21,253 Argentine literates, around 47,402 people of mainly European descent resided in Buenos Aires in 1855; they would have comprised about 51.6% of a total population of 91,895 inhabitants.\nGreat wave of immigration from Europe (1857\u20131940).\nIn February 1856, the municipal government of &lt;a href=\"Baradero\"&gt;Baradero&lt;/a&gt; granted lands for the settlement of ten Swiss families in an agricultural colony near that town. Later that year, another colony was founded by Swiss immigrants in &lt;a href=\"Esperanza%2C%20Santa%20Fe\"&gt;Esperanza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20Province\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt;. These provincial initiatives remained isolated cases until differences between the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Confederation\"&gt;Argentine Confederation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;State of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; were resolved with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pav%C3%B3n\"&gt;Battle of Pav\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in 1861, and a strong central government could be established. Presidents &lt;a href=\"Bartolom%C3%A9%20Mitre\"&gt;Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre&lt;/a&gt; (the victor at Pav\u00f3n), &lt;a href=\"Domingo%20Sarmiento\"&gt;Domingo Sarmiento&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Avellaneda\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda&lt;/a&gt; implemented policies that encouraged massive European immigration. These were formalized with the 1876 &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; approval of Law 817 of Immigration and Colonization, signed by President Avellaneda. During the following decades, and until the mid-20th century, waves of European settlers came to Argentina. Major contributors included Italy (initially from &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt;, Veneto and &lt;a href=\"Lombardy\"&gt;Lombardy&lt;/a&gt;, later from &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;, Calabria, and &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;), and Spain (most were &lt;a href=\"Galician%20people\"&gt;Galicians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basque%20people\"&gt;Basques&lt;/a&gt;), but there were &lt;a href=\"Asturian%20people\"&gt;Asturians&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmaller but significant numbers of immigrants include those from France, &lt;a href=\"Polish%20people\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20people\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20Germans\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20people\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20people\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20people\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, England, Scotland, Ireland, &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20people\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20people\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danish%20people\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, and others. Europeans from the former &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; were mainly &lt;a href=\"Greek%20people\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of Argentina's &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Jew\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; descend from immigrants of &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jewish\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jewish&lt;/a&gt; origin.\n1) The exponential growth of the country's population. In the first National Census of 1869 the Argentine population was just 1,877,490 inhabitants, in 1895 it had doubled to 4,044,911, in 1914 it had reached 7,903,662, and by 1947 it had doubled again to 15,893,811. It is estimated that by 1920, more than 50% of the residents in Buenos Aires had been born abroad. According to Zulma Recchini de Lattes' estimate, if this great immigratory wave from Europe and the Middle East had not happened, Argentina's population by 1960 would have been less than 8\u00a0million, while the national census carried out that year revealed a population of 20,013,793 inhabitants. Argentina received a total of 6,611,000 European and Middle-Eastern immigrants during the period 1857\u20131940; 2,970,000 were Italians (44.9%), 2,080,000 were Spaniards (31.5%), and the remaining 23.6% was composed of French, Poles, Russians, Germans, Austro-Hungarians, British, Portuguese, Swiss, Belgians, Danes, Dutch, Swedes, etc.\n2) A radical change in its ethnic composition; the 1914 National Census revealed that around 80% of the national population were either European immigrants, their children or grandchildren. Among the remaining 20% (those descended from the population residing locally before this immigrant wave took shape), around a fifth were of mainly European descent. Put down to numbers, this means that about 84%, or 6,300,000 people (out of a total population of 7,903,662), residing in Argentina were of European descent. European immigration continued to account for over half the nation's population growth during the 1920s, and was again significant (albeit in a smaller wave) following World War II.\nThe distribution of these European/Middle Eastern immigrants was not uniform across the country. Most newcomers settled in the coastal cities and the farmlands of &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20Province\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20Province%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Entre%20R%C3%ADos%20Province\"&gt;Entre R\u00edos&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the 1914 National Census showed that, of almost three million people \u22122,965,805 to be exact- living in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, 1,019,872 were European immigrants, and one and a half million more were children of European mothers; in all, this community comprised at least 84.9% of this region's population. The same dynamic was less evident in the rural areas of the northwestern provinces, however: immigrants (mostly of Syrian-Lebanese origin) represented a mere 2.6% (about 15,600) of a total rural population of 600,000 in &lt;a href=\"Jujuy%20Province\"&gt;Jujuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salta%20Province\"&gt;Salta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tucum%C3%A1n%20Province\"&gt;Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20del%20Estero%20Province\"&gt;Santiago del Estero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catamarca%20Province\"&gt;Catamarca&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin of the immigrants between 1857 and 1920.\nNotes: \nSource: \"Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Migraciones: Infograf\u00edas.\", that information was modified\u00a0\u2013 figures there are by nationality, not by country.\nSecond wave of immigration.\nDuring and after the Second World War, many Europeans fled to Argentina, escaping the hunger and poverty of the post-war period. According to the National Bureau of Migrations, during the period 1941\u20131950 at least 392,603 Europeans entered the country: 252,045 Italians, 110,899 Spaniards, 16,784 Poles, 7,373 Russians and 5,538 French. Among the notable Italian immigrants in that period were protest singer &lt;a href=\"Piero%20De%20Benedictis\"&gt;Piero De Benedictis&lt;/a&gt; (emigrated with his parents in 1948), actors &lt;a href=\"Rodolfo%20Ranni\"&gt;Rodolfo Ranni&lt;/a&gt; (emigrated in 1947) and &lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Lunadei\"&gt;Gianni Lunadei&lt;/a&gt; (1950), publisher &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20Civita\"&gt;C\u00e9sar Civita&lt;/a&gt; (1941), businessman &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Macri\"&gt;Francisco Macri&lt;/a&gt; (1949), lawmaker &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Verani\"&gt;Pablo Verani&lt;/a&gt; (1947), and rock musician &lt;a href=\"Los%20Gatos%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kay Galiffi&lt;/a&gt; (1950).\nArgentina also received thousands of &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;, including the humanitarian businessman &lt;a href=\"Oskar%20Schindler\"&gt;Oskar Schindler&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jews&lt;/a&gt;, and hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20war%20criminals\"&gt;Nazi war criminals&lt;/a&gt;. Notorious beneficiaries of &lt;a href=\"Ratlines%20%28history%29\"&gt;ratlines&lt;/a&gt; included &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Eichmann\"&gt;Adolf Eichmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Mengele\"&gt;Josef Mengele&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Priebke\"&gt;Erich Priebke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rodolfo%20Freude\"&gt;Rodolfo Freude&lt;/a&gt; (who became the first director of &lt;a href=\"SIDE\"&gt;Argentine State Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Usta%C5%A1e\"&gt;Usta\u0161e&lt;/a&gt; Head of State of Croatia, &lt;a href=\"Ante%20Paveli%C4%87\"&gt;Ante Paveli\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. It is still matter of debate whether the Argentine government of President &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;Juan Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the presence of these criminals on Argentine soil or not; but the consequence was that Argentina was considered a Nazi haven for several decades.\nThe flow of European immigration continued during the 1950s and afterward; but compared to the previous decade, it diminished considerably. The &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Plan\"&gt;Marshall Plan&lt;/a&gt; implemented by the United States to help Europe recover from the consequences of World War II was working, and emigration lessened. During the period 1951\u20131960, only 242,889 Europeans entered Argentina: 142,829 were Italians, 98,801 were Spaniards, 934 were French, and 325 were Poles. The next decade (1961\u20131970), the total number of European immigrants barely reached 13,363 (9,514 Spaniards, 1,845 Poles, 1,266 French and 738 Russians).\nEuropean immigration was nearly non-existent during the 1970s and the 1980s. Instability from 1970 to 1976 in the form of escalating violence between &lt;a href=\"Montoneros\"&gt;Montoneros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Anticommunist%20Alliance\"&gt;Triple A&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20War\"&gt;Dirty War&lt;/a&gt; waged against leftists after the &lt;a href=\"March%201976%20coup\"&gt;March 1976 coup&lt;/a&gt;, was compounded by an economic crisis caused by the 1981 collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Alfredo%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20de%20Hoz\"&gt;dictatorship's domestic policies&lt;/a&gt;. This situation encouraged emigration rather than immigration of Europeans and European-Argentines alike, and during the 1971\u20131976 period at least 9,971 Europeans left the country. During the period 1976\u20131983\u00a0thousands of Argentines and numerous Europeans were kidnapped and killed in clandestine centers by the military dictatorship's \"grupos de tareas\" (task groups); these included &lt;a href=\"Haroldo%20Conti\"&gt;Haroldo Conti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagmar%20Hagelin\"&gt;Dagmar Hagelin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rodolfo%20Walsh\"&gt;Rodolfo Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9onie%20Duquet\"&gt;L\u00e9onie Duquet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alice%20Domon\"&gt;Alice Domon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9ctor%20Oesterheld\"&gt;H\u00e9ctor Oesterheld&lt;/a&gt; (all presumably assassinated in 1977) and &lt;a href=\"Jacobo%20Timerman\"&gt;Jacobo Timerman&lt;/a&gt; (who was liberated in 1979; sought exile in &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, and returned in 1984). &lt;a href=\"CONADEP\"&gt;CONADEP&lt;/a&gt;, the commission formed by President &lt;a href=\"Ra%C3%BAl%20Alfons%C3%ADn\"&gt;Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, investigated and documented the existence of at least 8,960 cases, though other estimates vary between 13,000 and 30,000 dead.\nRecent trends.\nThe principal source of immigration into Argentina after 1960 was no longer from Europe, but rather from bordering South American countries. During the period in between the Censuses of 1895 and 1914, immigrants from Europe comprised 88.4% of the total, and Latin American immigrants represented only 7.5%. By the 1960s, however, this trend had been completely reversed: the Latin American immigrants were 76.1%, and the Europeans merely 18.7% of the total.\nGiven that the main sources of South American immigrants since the 1960s have been Bolivia, &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, most of these immigrants have been either &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mestizo\"&gt;Mestizo&lt;/a&gt;, for they represent the ethnic majorities in those countries. The increasing numbers of immigrants from these sources has caused the proportion of Argentines of European descent to be reduced significantly in certain areas of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Greater Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; (particularly in &lt;a href=\"Mor%C3%B3n%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Mor\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"La%20Matanza%20Partido\"&gt;La Matanza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20Partido\"&gt;Escobar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tres%20de%20Febrero%20Partido\"&gt;Tres de Febrero&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the Buenos Aires neighbourhoods of &lt;a href=\"Flores\"&gt;Flores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Soldati\"&gt;Villa Soldati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Lugano\"&gt;Villa Lugano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt;. Many Amerindian or Mestizo people of Bolivian/Paraguayan/Peruvian origin have suffered &lt;a href=\"racist%20discrimination\"&gt;racist discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, and in some cases, violence, or have been victims of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20slavery\"&gt;sexual slavery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forced%20labor\"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt; in textile &lt;a href=\"sweat%20shop\"&gt;sweat shop&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLatin American immigrants of European origin.\nLatin Americans of predominantly European descent have arrived from countries where there is a relevant proportion of white population &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; (52%), &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (47.7%), &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (37%), &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; (20.0%) and in particular, &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; (88%). Uruguayan immigrants represent a very distinct case in Argentina, for they may pass unnoticed as \"foreigners\". &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; received a great part of the same influx of European immigrants that changed Argentina's ethnic profile, so most Uruguayans are of European origin (estimates vary from 87.4% to 94.6%). Uruguayans and Argentines also speak the same &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20dialects\"&gt;Spanish dialect&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Rioplatense%20Spanish\"&gt;Rioplatense Spanish&lt;/a&gt;), which is heavily influenced by the intonation patterns of the Italian language's southern dialects.\nThe official censuses show a slow growth in the Uruguayan-born community: 51,100 in 1970, 114,108 in 1980, and 135,406 in 1991, with a decline to 117,564 in 2001. Around 218,000 Uruguayans emigrated to Argentina between 1960 and 1980, however.\nThird immigratory wave from Eastern Europe (1994\u20132000).\nFollowing the fall of the Communist regimes of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and Eastern Europe, the governments of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Bloc\"&gt;Western Bloc&lt;/a&gt; were worried about a possible massive exodus from Eastern Europe and Russia. President &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Sa%C3%BAl%20Menem\"&gt;Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 in the political framework of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Consensus\"&gt;Washington Consensus&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 offered to receive part of that emigratory wave in Argentina. Accordingly, Resolution 4632/94 was enacted on 19 December 1994, allowing \"special treatment\" for all the applicants who wished to emigrate from the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;former Soviet republics&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 9,399 Eastern Europeans emigrated to Argentina from January 1994 to December 2000, and of the total, 6,720 were &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20people\"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt; (71.5%), 1,598 were &lt;a href=\"Russian%20people\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt; (17%), 160 &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20people\"&gt;Romanians&lt;/a&gt; (1.7%), 122 &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20people\"&gt;Bulgarians&lt;/a&gt; (1.3%), 94 &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20people\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt; (1%), 150 &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20people\"&gt;Georgians&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Moldovan%20people\"&gt;Moldovans&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Polish%20people\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; (1.6%) and 555 (5.9%) traveled with a Soviet passport.\nAround 85% of the newcomers were under age 45, and 51% had a university education, so most integrated quite rapidly into Argentine society, albeit with some initial difficulties finding gainful employment. These also included some 200 Romanian &lt;a href=\"Romani%20people\"&gt;Gypsy&lt;/a&gt; families that arrived in 1998, and 140 more Romanian Gypsies who migrated to Uruguay in 1999, but only to enter Argentina later by crossing the &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20river\"&gt;Uruguay river&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Bentos\"&gt;Fray Bentos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salto%2C%20Uruguay\"&gt;Salto&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Colonia%20del%20Sacramento\"&gt;Colonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nEuropean immigration in Argentina has not stopped since this wave from Eastern Europe. According to the National Bureau of Migrations, some 14,964 Europeans have settled in Argentina (3,599 Spaniards, 1,407 Italians and 9,958 from other countries) during the period 1999\u20132004. To this figure, many of the 8,285 Americans and 4,453 Uruguayans may be added, since these countries have European-descended majorities of 75% and 87% in their populations.\nInfluences on Argentine culture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"culture%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;culture of Argentina&lt;/a&gt; is the result of a fusion of European, &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afro-Argentines\"&gt;Black African&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Argentines\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; elements. The impact of European immigration on both Argentina's culture and demography has largely become mainstream and is shared by most Argentines, being no longer perceived as a separate \"European\" culture. Even those traditional elements that have Amerindian origin\u00a0\u2013 as the \"&lt;a href=\"Mate%20%28beverage%29\"&gt;mate&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Andean%20music\"&gt;Andean music&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 or Criollo origin\u00a0\u2013 the \"&lt;a href=\"asado\"&gt;asado&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"empanada\"&gt;empanada&lt;/a&gt;s\", and some genres within folklore music\u00a0\u2013 were rapidly adopted, assimilated and sometimes modified by the European immigrants and their descendants.\nTango.\nArgentine tango is a hybrid genre, result of the fusion of different ethnic and cultural elements, so well intermingled that it is difficult to identify them separately. According to some experts, tango has combined elements from three main sources:\n1) The music played by the &lt;a href=\"Afro%20Argentine\"&gt;Black African&lt;/a&gt; communities of the R\u00edo de la Plata region. Its very name might derive from a word in &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20language\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt; -a &lt;a href=\"Bantu%20language\"&gt;Bantu language&lt;/a&gt;- and its rhythm appears to be based on &lt;a href=\"candombe\"&gt;candombe&lt;/a&gt;.\n2) The &lt;a href=\"Milonga%20%28music%29\"&gt;milonga campera&lt;/a&gt;, a popular genre among the &lt;a href=\"gaucho\"&gt;gaucho&lt;/a&gt;s that lived in the &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; countryside, and later moved to the city looking for better jobs.\n3) The music brought by the European immigrants: the Andalucian tanguillo, the &lt;a href=\"polka\"&gt;polka&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"waltz\"&gt;waltz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tarantella\"&gt;tarantella&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey heavily influenced its melody and its sound by adding instruments such as piano, violin and -especially- &lt;a href=\"bandone%C3%B3n\"&gt;bandone\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn spite of this tripartite origin, tango mainly developed as urban music, and was assimilated and embraced by European immigrants and their descendants; most icons of the genre were either European or had largely European ancestry.\nArgentine Folk music.\nWhen the Spaniards arrived in what is now Argentina, the Amerindian inhabitants already had their own musical culture: instruments, dances, rhythms and styles. Much of that culture was lost during and after the conquest; only &lt;a href=\"Andean%20music\"&gt;the music played by the Andean peoples&lt;/a&gt; survived in the shape of chants such as vidalas and &lt;a href=\"huayno\"&gt;huayno&lt;/a&gt;s, and in dances like the &lt;a href=\"carnavalito\"&gt;carnavalito&lt;/a&gt;. The peoples of &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Chaco\"&gt;Gran Chaco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt; -areas that the Spaniards did not effectively occupied- kept their cultures almost untouched until the late 19th century.\nThe major Spanish contribution to music in the R\u00edo de la Plata area during the colonial period was the introduction of three instruments: the \"vihuela\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Classical%20guitar\"&gt;guitarra criolla&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"bombo%20leg%C3%BCero\"&gt;bombo leg\u00fcero&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"charango\"&gt;charango&lt;/a&gt;\" (a small guitar, similar to the &lt;a href=\"tiple\"&gt;tiple&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Canary%20Islands\"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;; made with the shell of an &lt;a href=\"armadillo\"&gt;armadillo&lt;/a&gt;). Once the &lt;a href=\"Criollo%20people\"&gt;Criollos&lt;/a&gt; obtained their independence from Spain, they had the chance to create new musical styles; dances like \"&lt;a href=\"peric%C3%B3n\"&gt;peric\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"triunfo%20%28dance%29\"&gt;triunfo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"gato%20%28artform%29\"&gt;gato&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"escondido\", and chants such as \"cielito\" and \"vidalita\" all appeared during the post-independence period, primarily in the 1820s.\nEuropean immigration brought important changes to Argentina's popular music, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Litoral&lt;/a&gt;; where new genres appeared, like \"chamam\u00e9\" and \"purajhei\" (or Paraguayan polka). &lt;a href=\"Chamam%C3%A9\"&gt;Chamam\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the second half of the 18th century -though it was not named as such until the 1930s- as a result of the fusion of ancient Guaran\u00ed rhythms with the music brought by the &lt;a href=\"Volga%20German\"&gt;Volga German&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20people\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polish%20people\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jew\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish immigrants that settled in the region. The newcomers added the melodic style of their &lt;a href=\"polka\"&gt;polka&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"waltz\"&gt;waltz&lt;/a&gt;es to the native rhythmic base, and played it with their own instruments, such as &lt;a href=\"accordion\"&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;s and violins.\nOther genres -like &lt;a href=\"chacarera\"&gt;chacarera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zamba%20%28artform%29\"&gt;zamba&lt;/a&gt;- developed as an integral fusion of Amerindian and European influences. While traditionally played on guitars, charangos and bombos, they also began to be played with other European instruments, such as piano; one notable example is &lt;a href=\"Sixto%20Palavecino\"&gt;Sixto Palavecino&lt;/a&gt;'s use of the violin to play the chacarera. Regardless of the origin of the different rhythms and styles, later European immigrants and their descendants rapidly assimilated the local music and contributed to those genres creating new songs.\nSports.\nMany sports that nowadays are very popular in Argentina were introduced by European immigrants -particularly by the British- in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt; is by far the most popular sport in Argentina. It was brought by the British railway businessmen and workers, and it was later embraced with passion by the other collectivities. The first official football match ever played in Argentina took place on 20 June 1867, when the \"White Caps\" beat the \"Red Caps\" by 4\u20130. A look at the list of players -eight by team- shows a collection of British names/surnames. \"White Caps\": Thomas Hogg, James Hogg, Thomas Smith, William Forrester, James W. Bond, E. Smith, Norman Smith and James Ramsbotham. \"Red Caps\": Walter Heald, Herbert Barge, Thomas Best, Urban Smith, John Wilmott, R. Ramsay, J. Simpson and William Boschetti. The development of this sport in Argentina was greatly boosted by Scottish teacher &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Watson%20Hutton\"&gt;Alexander Watson Hutton&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived in Argentina in 1882 and founded the Buenos Aires English High School in 1884, hiring his countryman William Walters as coach of the school's football team. On 21 February 1893 Watson founded the Argentine Association Football League, the historical antecedent of the &lt;a href=\"Asociaci%C3%B3n%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Argentino\"&gt;Asociaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Argentino&lt;/a&gt;. Watson's son &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Watson%20Hutton\"&gt;Arnold&lt;/a&gt; continued the tradition playing during the amateur age of Argentine football.\nTennis was also imported by the British immigrants; in April 1892 they founded the &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Lawn%20Tennis%20Club\"&gt;Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club&lt;/a&gt;. Among the founding members, we find all British surnames: Arthur Herbert, W. Watson, Adrian Penard, C. Thursby, H. Mills and F. Wallace. Soon their example was followed by British immigrants who resided in Rosario; F. Still, T. Knox, W. Birschoyle, M. Leywe and J. Boyles founded the Rosario Lawn Tennis.\nThe first Argentine tennis player of European descent to achieve some international success was &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Ter%C3%A1n%20de%20Weiss\"&gt;Mary Ter\u00e1n de Weiss&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s and 1950s; the sport, however, was considered an elite men's sport and her efforts to popularize this activity among women did not prosper at the time. &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Vilas\"&gt;Guillermo Vilas&lt;/a&gt;, who is of Spanish descent, won the French Open and the &lt;a href=\"US%20Open%20%28tennis%29\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; both in 1977, and two Australian Open in 1978 and 1979, and popularized the sport in Argentina.\nAnother sport in which Argentines with European ancestry have stood out is car racing. The greatest exponent was &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Manuel%20Fangio\"&gt;Juan Manuel Fangio&lt;/a&gt;, whose parents were both Italian. He won five &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; World titles in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957; his five-championships record remained unbeaten until 2003, when &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Schumacher\"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; obtained his sixth &lt;a href=\"F1\"&gt;F1&lt;/a&gt; trophy. Another exponents are &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Alberto%20Reutemann\"&gt;Carlos Alberto Reutemann&lt;/a&gt; (his grandfather was &lt;a href=\"German-speaking%20Switzerland\"&gt;German Swiss&lt;/a&gt;, and his mother was Italian), who reached the second place in the World Drivers' Championship of 1981.\n&lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;Boxing&lt;/a&gt; is another popular sport which was also brought by the British immigrants. The first championship ever organized in Argentina took place in December 1899, and the champion was &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Newbery\"&gt;Jorge Newbery&lt;/a&gt; (son of a &lt;a href=\"White%20American\"&gt;White American&lt;/a&gt; odontologist who migrated after the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;), one of the pioneers of boxing, car racing and aviation in the country. A list of Argentine boxers of European descent should include: &lt;a href=\"Luis%20%C3%81ngel%20Firpo\"&gt;Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed \"the wild bull of the pampas\", whose father was Italian and his mother was Spanish), &lt;a href=\"Nicolino%20Locche\"&gt;Nicolino Locche&lt;/a&gt; (who was nicknamed \"the Untouchable\" for his defensive style; both his parents were Italian), etc.\nGolf was brought to Argentina by &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Argentine\"&gt;Scottish Argentine&lt;/a&gt; Valent\u00edn Scroggie, who established the nation's first &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Mart%C3%ADn%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;San Mart\u00edn, Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; in 1892. The Argentine Golf Association was founded in 1926 and includes over 43,000 members.\n&lt;a href=\"Field%20hockey\"&gt;Hockey&lt;/a&gt; was another sport imported by the British immigrants in the early 20th century. It was initially played in the clubs founded by the British citizens until 1908, when the first official matches between Belgrano Athletic, San Isidro Club y Pacific Railways (today San Mart\u00edn) took place. That same year the \"Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Hockey\" was founded, and its first president was Thomas Bell. In 1909 this Association allowed the formation of female teams. One of the first feminine teams was Belgrano Ladies; they played their first match on 25 August 1909, against St. Catherine's College, winning by 1 to 0.\nCycling was introduced by Italian immigrants in Argentina in 1898, when they founded the \"Club Ciclista Italiano\". One of the first South American champions in this sport was an Argentine of Italian descent, &lt;a href=\"Clodomiro%20Cortoni\"&gt;Clodomiro Cortoni&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; was also brought by British immigrants. The first rugby match ever played in Argentina took place in 1873; the teams were Bancos (Banks) against Ciudad (City). In 1886, the &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Buenos Aires Football Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Athletic%20Club\"&gt;Rosario Athletic Club&lt;/a&gt; played the first official match between clubs. The River Plate Rugby Championship was founded on 10 April 1889, and was the direct antecedent of the &lt;a href=\"Uni%C3%B3n%20Argentina%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;Uni\u00f3n Argentina de Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, created to organize local championships; the founding clubs were &lt;a href=\"Belgrano%20Athletic\"&gt;Belgrano Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Buenos Aires Football Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lomas%20Athletic\"&gt;Lomas Athletic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Athletic\"&gt;Rosario Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. Its first president was &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Corry%20Smith\"&gt;Leslie Corry Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and Lomas Athletic was the first champion that same year."
