    "text": "Willie Clayton (born March 29, 1955) is an American &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20blues\"&gt;Chicago blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soul-blues\"&gt;soul-blues&lt;/a&gt; singer and songwriter. He has recorded over 25 &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;s since the 1980s. He has been performing since the late 1960s. His &lt;a href=\"record%20chart\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; successes span the decades from the 1980s onward.\n&lt;a href=\"Allmusic\"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; noted that Clayton is \"one of those vocalists who could sing the phone book and the result would sound perfectly phrased and memorable.\" Along with &lt;a href=\"Buddy%20Guy\"&gt;Buddy Guy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koko%20Taylor\"&gt;Koko Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Milton\"&gt;Little Milton&lt;/a&gt;, Clayton was one of the most important figures in Chicago blues in the 1970s and 1980s.\nBiography.\nClayton was born in &lt;a href=\"Indianola%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Indianola, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, one of 11 siblings. He sang &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20music\"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt; in his church as a youngster. Duplex Records issued his debut &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;, \"That's the Way Daddy Did\" (1969). In 1971, Clayton relocated to &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared regularly in local &lt;a href=\"nightclub\"&gt;clubs&lt;/a&gt;. He was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Al%20Green\"&gt;Al Green&lt;/a&gt;'s record producer, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Mitchell%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Willie Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, who signed Clayton to a &lt;a href=\"recording%20contract\"&gt;recording contract&lt;/a&gt; with Pawn, a subsidiary &lt;a href=\"record%20label\"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hi%20Records\"&gt;Hi Records&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell produced several tracks with Clayton, including \"I Must Be Losin' You,\" \"It's Time You Made Up Your Mind,\" and \"Baby You're Ready,\" but none of them reached the national charts. Clayton toured nationally on the same bill as Green, &lt;a href=\"James%20Brown\"&gt;James Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barry%20White\"&gt;Barry White&lt;/a&gt;, before creating his own label, Sky Hero, which issued \"Living with You, But My Heart Is Somewhere Else.\"\nClayton released the single \"Rock You\" for the Good Luck record label in 1980. The song was written and produced by the Lu-Cor Music team of Maurice Commander and Jerline Shelton-Commander, as well as, S. Harris (according to label printing). Another Chicago-based artist who made on the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20charts\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Train\"&gt;Soul Train&lt;/a&gt;\" with the efforts of the Lu-Cor team (&lt;a href=\"Morris%20Jefferson\"&gt;Morris Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;) later covered the song for the re-release of the album \"Rock You!\" in the late 1980s.\nClayton then joined Compleat Records. He issued a couple of singles before \"Tell Me\", produced by &lt;a href=\"General%20Crook%20%28musician%29\"&gt;General Crook&lt;/a&gt;, was a modest hit in 1984. It was followed on the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"record%20chart\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; by \"What a Way to Put It.\" He returned to the R&amp;B chart in 1989, credited by &lt;a href=\"Polydor%20Records\"&gt;Polydor Records&lt;/a&gt; as Will Clayton, with \"Never Too Late\" and \"Tell Me\" (a different song from his earlier hit), followed by \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", on which he was co-credited with Audrey Wheeler, a former runner-up in the &lt;a href=\"Miss%20Black%20Universe\"&gt;Miss Black Universe&lt;/a&gt; contest, who also recorded with &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Lorber\"&gt;Jeff Lorber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Chandler\"&gt;Omar Chandler&lt;/a&gt; and worked as a session singer. Clayton also recorded a number of albums with &lt;a href=\"Ichiban%20Records\"&gt;Ichiban Records&lt;/a&gt;. In 1992, a joint &lt;a href=\"compilation%20album\"&gt;compilation album&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20McClure\"&gt;Bobby McClure&lt;/a&gt;, \"Bobby McClure &amp; Willie Clayton\", was released by Hi Records.\nIn 1993, &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Records%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Ace Records&lt;/a&gt; released the album \"Let's Get Together\", followed by \"Simply Beautiful\" and \"It's About Love\" (1999). His 1998 album, \"Something to Talk About\", reached number 14 on the \"Billboard\" Top Blues Albums chart. Clayton had similar chart successes for the following ten years. \"Something to Talk About\" included his &lt;a href=\"Duet%20%28music%29\"&gt;duet&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tyrone%20Davis\"&gt;Tyrone Davis&lt;/a&gt; on the song \"Mine All Mine\" and his &lt;a href=\"cover%20version\"&gt;cover version&lt;/a&gt;s of the songs \"&lt;a href=\"Something%20to%20Talk%20About%20%28Bonnie%20Raitt%20song%29\"&gt;Something to Talk About&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20No%20Love%20in%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20City\"&gt;Heart of the City&lt;/a&gt;.\" Clayton started another record label, EndZone, in the late 1990s. He signed with &lt;a href=\"Malaco%20Records\"&gt;Malaco Records&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.\nClayton recorded his version of \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Can%27t%20Stand%20the%20Rain%20%28song%29\"&gt;I Can't Stand the Rain&lt;/a&gt;\" on his 2008 album \"Soul &amp; Blues\". \"My Tyme\", which was released the same year, was his third album in a five-year period to peak at number 83 on the \"Billboard\" &lt;a href=\"Top%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Albums\"&gt;Top R&amp;B Albums&lt;/a&gt; chart. He returned to the singles chart in 2010, after an absence of over 20 years, with his recording of \"We Both Grown\", a duet with &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Hollister\"&gt;Dave Hollister&lt;/a&gt;\nHis latest album, \"I Am Rhythm &amp; Blues\", was released in 2012. In May 2013, Clayton performed at the Leflore County Civic Center in &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Greenwood, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;."
