    "text": "Fair Hill Burial Ground is a historic cemetery in the &lt;a href=\"Fairhill%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Fairhill&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Founded by the &lt;a href=\"Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends\"&gt;Religious Society of Friends&lt;/a&gt; in 1703, it fell into disuse until the 1840s when it was revived by the Hicksite Quaker community of Philadelphia, which played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;abolition&lt;/a&gt; and early women's rights movements. The cemetery is currently operated by the Fair Hill Burial Corporation, which is owned by Quakers and neighborhood community members.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Penn\"&gt;William Penn&lt;/a&gt; gave 1250 acres in Pennsylvania to &lt;a href=\"George%20Fox\"&gt;George Fox&lt;/a&gt; in 1681. Fox dedicated six acres in 1686 for a meeting house and burial ground near the current site of the burial ground. Burials began about 1707, but the site didn't develop into an active burial ground. The Green Street Monthly Meeting took control of the site in 1818.\nFollowing the Orthodox-Hicksite split, the three Hicksite meetings in Philadelphia in 1840 \u2013 Philadelphia Meeting, Spruce Street Meeting, Green Street Meeting \u2013 agreed to use the land for a burial ground. Starting in 1843, a Joint Committee on Interments oversaw the burial ground. The Fair Hill Meeting House was built nearby, on Cambria Street in the 1880s.\nBoth the meetinghouse and the burial ground were sold to Ephesians Baptist Church in 1985, but in 1993 the burial ground was purchased by the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting, which continues to own and maintain it."
