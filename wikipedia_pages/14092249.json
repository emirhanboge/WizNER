    "text": "The \"Morris\"-\"Taney\"-class revenue cutters were 13 &lt;a href=\"Cutter%20%28ship%29\"&gt;cutters&lt;/a&gt; built at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; at the Webb and Allen shipyard between 18301833. These cutters were the backbone of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service\"&gt;United States Revenue Cutter Service&lt;/a&gt; for more than a decade. &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Humphreys\"&gt;Samuel Humphreys&lt;/a&gt; designed these cutters for roles as diverse as fighting &lt;a href=\"Piracy\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;s, combating smugglers and operating with naval forces. He designed the vessels on a naval &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; concept. They had &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Clipper\"&gt;Baltimore Clipper&lt;/a&gt; lines. The vessels, built by Webb and Allen, were designed by Isaac Webb and resembled Humphreys' design but had one less port.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"William%20Thiessen\"&gt;William Thiessen&lt;/a&gt;, this was the first class of cutters where all ships were identical.\nReferences.\n "
