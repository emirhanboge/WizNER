    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, void means of no legal effect. An action, document, or transaction which is void is of no legal effect whatsoever: an absolute nullity\u2014the law treats it as if it had never existed or happened. The term void \"ab initio\", which means \"to be treated as invalid from the outset,\" comes from adding the Latin phrase \"ab initio\" (from the beginning) as a qualifier. For example, in many jurisdictions where a person signs a &lt;a href=\"contract\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"duress%20%28contract%20law%29\"&gt;duress&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"contract\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; is treated as being void \"ab initio\". The frequent combination \"null and void\" is a &lt;a href=\"legal%20doublet\"&gt;legal doublet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term is frequently used in contradistinction to the term \"&lt;a href=\"voidable\"&gt;voidable&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"unenforceable\"&gt;unenforceable&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDefinition.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Black%27s%20Law%20Dictionary\"&gt;Black's Law Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;\" defines \"void\" as:\n which means there is no legal obligation therefore there will be no breach of contract since the contract is null.\nThe dictionary further goes on to define void \"ab initio\" as:\nIn practical terms, void is usually used in contradistinction to \"&lt;a href=\"voidable\"&gt;voidable&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"unenforceable\"&gt;unenforceable&lt;/a&gt;\", the principal difference being that an action which is voidable remains valid until it is avoided.\nSignificance.\nThe significance of this usually lies in the possibility of third party rights being acquired in good faith. For example, in \"&lt;a href=\"Cundy%20v%20Lindsay\"&gt;Cundy v Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;\" (1878), a &lt;a href=\"confidence%20trick\"&gt;fraudster&lt;/a&gt; using the name Blenkarn posed as a retailer and induced Lindsay &amp; Co to deliver 250 dozen linen handkerchiefs to him. Blenkarn then sold the handkerchiefs on to an innocent third party, Cundy, but Lindsay was never paid. Lindsay, claiming ownership of the handkerchiefs, sued Cundy for their return. If the contract of sale to Blenkarn was held to be \"voidable\" for fraud, then Lindsay &amp; Co would only have recourse against the insolvent Blenkarn. However, if (as was held) the &lt;a href=\"contract\"&gt;contract of sale&lt;/a&gt; was \"void ab initio\", then the title did not pass from Lindsay to Blenkarn in the first place, and Lindsay could claim back the handkerchiefs from Cundy as their property. Cundy was left with only a claim against the insolvent Blenkarn.\nIn every case, third parties involved with &lt;a href=\"bad%20faith\"&gt;bad faith&lt;/a&gt; in void or voidable contracts not only are affected by nullity, but may also be liable for statutory damages.\nHowever, the right to avoid a voidable transaction can be lost (usually lost by delay). These are sometimes referred to as \"bars to &lt;a href=\"Rescission%20%28contract%20law%29\"&gt;rescission&lt;/a&gt;\". Such considerations do not apply to matters affected by absolute nullity, or void \"ab initio\"."
