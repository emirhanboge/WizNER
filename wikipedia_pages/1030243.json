    "text": "The DR Congo national football team, recognised by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; as Congo DR (formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Zaire\"&gt;Zaire&lt;/a&gt;, alternatively known as Congo-Kinshasa), represents the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; in men's international &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and it is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Congolese%20Association%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Congolese Association Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;. They are nicknamed \"the Leopards\". The team is a member of &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20African%20Football\"&gt;Confederation of African Football&lt;/a&gt; (CAF).\nCongo DR have been ranked as high as 28th in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Rankings\"&gt;FIFA Rankings&lt;/a&gt;. As Zaire they were the first &lt;a href=\"Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;n team to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and twice won the &lt;a href=\"Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Congolese%20Association%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Congolese Association Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1919 when the country was not independent. The team played their first game in 1948 as &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Congo\"&gt;Belgian Congo&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Rhodesia\"&gt;Northern Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt;, now Zambia. The team recorded a 3\u20132 victory at home. DR Congo has been &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; affiliated since 1962 and has been a member of &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20African%20Football\"&gt;CAF&lt;/a&gt; since 1963. The team's first official match was on 11 April 1963, against &lt;a href=\"Mauritania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"L%27Amiti%C3%A9%20Tournament\"&gt;L'Amiti\u00e9 Tournament&lt;/a&gt; played in &lt;a href=\"Dakar\"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;, Senegal. DR Congo won the match 6\u20130. The national team appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in &lt;a href=\"1965%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlory period.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo had its first international success at the &lt;a href=\"1968%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1968 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Ghana%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the final. The team's biggest ever win came on 22 November 1969 when they recorded a 10\u20131 home victory against &lt;a href=\"Zambia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;. Although a handful of Congolese players were playing in Europe (particularly Belgium) during these years, foreign-based players were seldom recalled for international duty; a rare exception was &lt;a href=\"Julien%20Kialunda\"&gt;Julien Kialunda&lt;/a&gt; who represented Zaire (as the country was by then known) at the &lt;a href=\"1972%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations%20squads\"&gt;1972 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; while playing for &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second continental title came at the &lt;a href=\"1974%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1974 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; in Egypt. The Leopards recorded a 2\u20131 victory against &lt;a href=\"Guinea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, another 2\u20131 victory against rivals &lt;a href=\"Congo%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt; and a 4\u20131 victory against &lt;a href=\"Mauritius%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;. These results carried Zaire through to the semi-finals where they beat hosts &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132. In the final, Zaire drew with &lt;a href=\"Zambia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20132. Therefore, the match was replayed two days later, where Zaire won the game 2\u20130. Zaire player &lt;a href=\"Ndaye%20Mulamba\"&gt;Ndaye Mulamba&lt;/a&gt; was top scorer with nine goals, which remains a record for the tournament. After this, the team returned to Zaire on the Presidential plane, lent to them by &lt;a href=\"Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko\"&gt;Mobutu Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;.\nZaire were the first &lt;a href=\"Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;n team to participate in a &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 tournament&lt;/a&gt; in place of the 1970 participant &lt;a href=\"Morocco%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, whom they defeated in the decisive qualifier 3\u20130 in &lt;a href=\"Kinshasa\"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;. Such was the desire to foster an identity of Zaire as a global player that Mobutu paid for advertising hoardings at the World Cup to display messages such as \u2018Zaire-Peace\u2019 and \u2018Go to Zaire\u2019. At the tournament itself, Zaire did not manage to score any goals and lost all of its games, but gave credible performances against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. However, their 9\u20130 loss against &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the worst World Cup defeats. A bizarre moment came in the match versus Brazil; facing a free-kick 25 yards out, defender &lt;a href=\"Mwepu%20Ilunga\"&gt;Mwepu Ilunga&lt;/a&gt;, upon hearing the referee blow his whistle, ran out of the Zaire wall and kicked the ball upfield, for which he received a yellow card. This was voted the 17th greatest World Cup moment in a Channel 4 poll. Ilunga has stated that he was quite aware of the rules and was hoping to convince the referee to send him off. The intended red card would have been a protest against his country's authorities, who were alleged to be depriving the players of their earnings. Many contemporary commentators instead held it to be an example of African football's \"na\u00efvety and indiscipline\".\nCrisis period.\nAfter winning the &lt;a href=\"1974%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1974 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; and participating in the &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the team was eliminated in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"1976%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1976 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; after recording a draw and two losses in the group stage. &lt;a href=\"Morocco%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; went on to win the tournament. From 1978 to 1986, the country did not qualify for the &lt;a href=\"African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, while not participating in qualification for the &lt;a href=\"1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1978 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1986 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"1988%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1988 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, Zaire finished last in their group despite having two draws.\nReturn to success.\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Zaire, reached three consecutive &lt;a href=\"African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; quarter-finals. In 1992 and 1994, they were beaten by &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1996 they were beaten by &lt;a href=\"Ghana%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997, the country returned to its former name of Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the national team was re-branded as the Simbas, a nickname that stuck for the next nine years. DR Congo played their first game on 8 June 1997 in &lt;a href=\"Pointe-Noire\"&gt;Pointe-Noire&lt;/a&gt; which ended in a 1\u20130 loss to the Republic of the Congo. At the &lt;a href=\"1998%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1998 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, DR Congo, led by Louis Watunda, surprisingly took third place, beating &lt;a href=\"Cameroon%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals and hosts &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131 on penalties in their last match after scoring three late goals to tie the encounter 4\u20134.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2000%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2000 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, the team finished third in their group, and in &lt;a href=\"2002%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; were eliminated in the quarter-finals by &lt;a href=\"Senegal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in &lt;a href=\"2004%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, DR Congo were eliminated after three straight defeats in the group stages. In &lt;a href=\"2006%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Le%20Roy\"&gt;Claude Le Roy&lt;/a&gt;, having finished second in the group behind &lt;a href=\"Cameroon%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, the Congolese were eliminated in the quarter-finals by &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131.\nStruggles.\nDR Congo were drawn in group 10 for qualifications for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2008 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Libya%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namibia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. Before the last match day, the Congolese led the group, but they drew 1\u20131 with Libya in their final match while Namibia beat Ethiopia 3\u20132. This sent Namibia through to the Finals, while the Leopards were eliminated. DR Congo also failed to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, DR Congo won the &lt;a href=\"2009%20African%20Championship%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2009 African Championship of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, a competition reserved to players in domestic leagues, a tournament they would again win in &lt;a href=\"2016%20African%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. DR Congo reached the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2013 Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; finals in South Africa but were knocked out in the group stages after drawing all three matches.\nThe Ibeng\u00e9 era: rise and near World Cup miss.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2015 Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, DR Congo again drew all three group matches but this time finished second in the group behind Tunisia, and therefore advanced to the quarter-finals to play their rivals &lt;a href=\"Congo%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, a match in which the Leopards came from two goals down to win 4\u20132. However, they were knocked out by the Ivory Coast 3\u20131 in the semi-finals. They ended up finishing third, beating Equatorial Guinea on penalties, after the third place match finished 0\u20130 in regulation time.\nDR Congo under Ibeng\u00e9 improved radically and had an outstanding performance for many decades in a World Cup qualification. During the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CAF%29\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt;, DR Congo was grouped with &lt;a href=\"Libya%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tunisia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guinea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. DR Congo managed an outstanding performance, beating Libya and Guinea home and away, but missed the chance after losing 1\u20132 to eventual World Cup qualifier Tunisia in &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt; and drew 2\u20132 at home to the same opponent.\nRecent schedule and results.\nThe following is a list of match results from the previous 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were selected for the &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; matches against &lt;a href=\"Algeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt; on 1 and 3 January 2022, respectively.
