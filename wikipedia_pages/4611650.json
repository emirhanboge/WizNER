    "text": "K\u0101ti M\u0101moe (also spelled Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe but not by the tribe themselves) is a historic &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"iwi\"&gt;iwi&lt;/a&gt;. Originally from the &lt;a href=\"Hastings%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Hastings area&lt;/a&gt;, they moved in the 16th century to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Island\"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt; which at the time was already occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Waitaha%20%28South%20Island%20iwi%29\"&gt;Waitaha&lt;/a&gt;.\nA century later, the Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe were largely subsequently absorbed via marriage and conquest by the &lt;a href=\"Ng%C4%81i%20Tahu\"&gt;Ng\u0101i Tahu&lt;/a&gt;, who migrated south in turn. There is no distinct Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe organisation today but many Ng\u0101i Tahu have Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe links in their &lt;a href=\"whakapapa\"&gt;whakapapa&lt;/a&gt;. In the far south of the island especially, \"... southern M\u0101ori still think of themselves as Ngai Tahu-Ngati Mamoe, a synthesis of the two tribal groups ...\"\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Shortland\"&gt;Edward Shortland&lt;/a&gt;, K\u0101ti M\u0101moe's historical hap\u016b included K\u0101ti Rakai and K\u0101ti Hinekato.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nK\u0101ti M\u0101moe's descent is traced from the ancestor Hotum\u0101moe, said to be a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Toi%20%28name%29\"&gt;Toi&lt;/a&gt;, a great-great-great grandson of &lt;a href=\"R%C4%81kaihaut%C5%AB\"&gt;R\u0101kaihaut\u016b&lt;/a&gt;. Hotum\u0101moe is said to have lived in the Heretaunga District.\nEarly migration stories say the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe were forced out of their home in the Heretaunga, and took refuge in &lt;a href=\"Te%20Whanganui-a-Tara\"&gt;Te Whanganui-a-Tara&lt;/a&gt; with the permission of &lt;a href=\"Ng%C4%81i%20Tara\"&gt;Ng\u0101i Tara&lt;/a&gt;'s ancestor and namesake, Tara. Later after they had moved down to the South Island, they defeated Waitaha along the east coast under the leadership of Chief T\u016btewaimate. His descendants lived on at &lt;a href=\"Rakaia\"&gt;Rakaia&lt;/a&gt; for about six generations.\n17th century.\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara.\nThe Ng\u0101i Tahu ancestress T\u016bhaitara insulting her husband Chief Marukore of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe, or &lt;a href=\"Te%20K%C4%81hea\"&gt;Te K\u0101hea&lt;/a&gt;, and his ancestry, as well as various other exchanges are the reason for war between their two tribes. T\u016bhaitara herself had a degree of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe heritage, but Marukore was viewed as below her status. They had 11 children in total, including Tamaraeroa, Huirapa, Tahumat\u0101, Pahirua, and Hinehou.\nT\u016bhaitara instructed Tamaraeroa and Huirapa to kill Marukore at a place called Papanui. However, Marukore knew of their plan and defeated them in the Battle of H\u016bkete after which their sister Hinehou laid them on the floor of her &lt;a href=\"whare\"&gt;whare&lt;/a&gt; for her grandchildren to see, and left her belongings with them before burning down the building in an incident now known as \"K\u0101rara K\u014dpae\" (The Laying Down of Fighting Chiefs). Alternatively, Marukore himself burned their bodies on a funeral pyre.\nNext the brothers Pahirua and Tahumat\u0101 sought out to defeat Marukore. As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui, at the hands of their son Pahirua who was very angry about the whole situation. In one telling of the series of battles, Hinehou and Pahirua built \"K\u0101rara K\u014dpae\" together, and burnt the bodies of all the slain there. The remaining children of the warring parents would move down to a place called Te Oreorehua in &lt;a href=\"Wairarapa\"&gt;Wairarapa&lt;/a&gt; where Hinehou was already living, and southward to &lt;a href=\"Te%20Whanganui-a-Tara\"&gt;Te Whanganui-a-Tara&lt;/a&gt; within a few generations, though their descendants are regarded as the senior lines of Ng\u0101i Tahu.\nNg\u0101i Tahu's attacks.\nHikaororoa, a prominent Ng\u0101i Tahu member, attacked Te Mata-ki-kaipoinga p\u0101 after his kinsman T\u016b\u0101huriri (great-grandson of T\u016bhaitara) insulted him. T\u016btekawa (T\u016b\u0101huriri's brother-in-law of senior &lt;a href=\"Ng%C4%81ti%20Kahungunu\"&gt;Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ng%C4%81ti%20Porou\"&gt;Ng\u0101ti Porou&lt;/a&gt;, and Ng\u0101ti Mamoe connections) withdrew his men to attack at another angle after his younger relative recognized an insult from Hikaororoa. He sent the same relative to warn T\u016b\u0101huriri and to escape, which he did into a nearby bush. For unknown reasons, when T\u016btekawa entered the p\u0101, he slew T\u016b\u0101huriri's wives Hinekaitaki and Tuar\u0101whati (Wh\u0101kuku's sisters). After the battle, T\u016btekawa fled down to Waik\u0101kahi on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ellesmere%20/%20Te%20Waihora\"&gt;Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora&lt;/a&gt; where he lived amongst his fellow Ng\u0101ti Mamoe. His additional family ties included his wife T\u016bk\u014drero being a sister to T\u016b\u0101huriri\u2019s wife Hinetewai (mother of H\u0101mua, T\u016brakautahi, and Moki). He was also a first cousin to both Ng\u0101i Tahu's Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b chief Te Rakiwhakaputa, and to the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe leader Tukiauau.\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with &lt;a href=\"Rangit%C4%81ne\"&gt;Rangit\u0101ne&lt;/a&gt; on the east coast of the South Island, Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the &lt;a href=\"Waiau%20Toa%20/%20Clarence%20River\"&gt;Waiau Toa / Clarence River&lt;/a&gt;. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the &lt;a href=\"Wairau%20River\"&gt;Wairau Valley&lt;/a&gt;. For this Ng\u0101ti Mamoe then ceded the east coast regions north of Waiau Toa to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101.\nNg\u0101ti Mamoe also fought against Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b in a battle now called \u014cpokihi. At Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b's p\u0101, Pariwhakatau, near the &lt;a href=\"Conway%20River%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Conway area&lt;/a&gt;, Tukiauau sneaked in and killed Manawa-i-waho. Mak\u014d-ha-kirikiri and his sisters Te Apai and Tokerau, Manawa-i-waho's wives were spared by the protection of the guardian; however, they were forced to leave the p\u0101 underneath her legs (she would have been a wooden figure or carving suspended in the air).\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had conquered northern &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, including Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b conquering the east coast down to &lt;a href=\"Kaik%C5%8Dura\"&gt;Kaik\u014dura&lt;/a&gt;, and Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among &lt;a href=\"Banks%20Peninsula\"&gt;Banks Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;'s Ng\u0101ti Mamoe. The last battle that was fought between the two tribes up to this point, was the Battle of Waipapa, before Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b took Takahanga p\u0101.\n18th century.\nAfter establishing dominance down to Kaik\u014dura, many of Ng\u0101i Tahu's leading chiefs were ready to expand further south into the island. Their chief, Moki, had learned of the location of T\u016btekawa, who was still living just further south at Te Waihora. Moki set off in his canoe and attacked various small villages including the Parak\u0101k\u0101riki p\u0101 at \u014ctanerito. T\u016btekawa was ultimately killed by Wh\u0101kuku, avenging his sisters. T\u016btekawa's son Te Rakit\u0101mau returned to the home, where he found his wife Punahikoia and children unharmed, and the attackers sleeping near the fire. Te Rakit\u0101mau did not avenge his father, but instead left a sign that he spared their lives, and peace was eventually restored between their descendants.\nNg\u0101i Tahu chief Te Rakiwhakaputa destroyed Ng\u0101ti Mamoe's p\u0101 at M\u0101nuka, across the hills at &lt;a href=\"Tai%20Tapu\"&gt;Taitapu&lt;/a&gt;. His son Manuhiri drove out of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe &lt;a href=\"Governors%20Bay\"&gt;\u014chinetahi&lt;/a&gt; and set up his base there. T\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara, established the Te K\u014dhaka-a-kaikai-a-waro p\u0101 (now &lt;a href=\"Kaiapoi\"&gt;Kaiapoi&lt;/a&gt; p\u0101) over a Waitaha site at the Taerutu Lagoon near &lt;a href=\"Woodend%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Woodend&lt;/a&gt;.\nT\u016brakautahi's son Kaweriri later travelled with a &lt;a href=\"taua\"&gt;taua&lt;/a&gt; south to &lt;a href=\"Lowther%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Lowther&lt;/a&gt; around the year 1725, where the K\u0101ti Mamoe chief Tutemakohu slayed him during the Battle of Waitaramea. Ng\u0101i Tahu's Chief Taoka would push further south to &lt;a href=\"Otakou\"&gt;\u014ct\u0101kou&lt;/a&gt;, where he engaged in some of the final battles with Ng\u0101ti Mamoe.\nOne of Ng\u0101ti Mamoe's leading chiefs, Te Whetuki (described as covered in wild long hair) was killed around this time near the &lt;a href=\"Waiau%20River%20%28Southland%29\"&gt;Waiau River&lt;/a&gt;. Two other members, Maka-tawhio and Pani-te-kaka, managed to escape the fighting by way of already being preoccupied looking for eels. Up that same river, the survivors retreated to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Te%20Anau\"&gt;Lake Te Anau&lt;/a&gt;, where they were relentlessly attacked again by Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b's forces. Chief Pukutahi and many others were slaughtered, with few survivors escaping across the lake on rafts, and disappearing into the mists on the other side. The last p\u0101 of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe was on &lt;a href=\"Mataura%20Island\"&gt;Mataura Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, marriages had been arranged between the two tribes to cement peace. Notably of Raki-ihia (Ng\u0101ti Mamoe) and Hineh\u0101kiri, the cousin of Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, and of Honekai, son of Te-hau-tapunui-o-T\u016b, with Raki-ihia's daughter Kohuwai. Despite this, occasional skirmishes still continued. Another chief alive at the time was Te Wera. &lt;a href=\"T%C5%ABhawaiki\"&gt;T\u016bhawaiki&lt;/a&gt; was one famous chief descended from the unions of the tribes.\nPopulation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2013%20New%20Zealand%20census\"&gt;2013 New Zealand census&lt;/a&gt;, 3,111 people, or less than 1% of the total population of M\u0101ori descent, were affiliated with the iwi.\nOf those, 18.9% identified with no other iwi, and 21.9% could converse in the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20language\"&gt;M\u0101ori language&lt;/a&gt;. The median age was 34.8 years, 46.4% were male and 53.7% were female. Among those 15 and older, 78.8% held a formal qualification, 44.6% had never been a regular smoker, the median income was $28,000, and 73.4% of those living in cities were employed.\nThe most common religions held by members of the iwi were Anglican (12.5%), Catholic (9.9%), and Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed (7.1%). A further 48% had no religion and 6.5% would not specify a religion. By comparison, 3.2% were affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Ratana\"&gt;Ratana&lt;/a&gt; movement, and less than 1% were affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Ringat%C5%AB\"&gt;Ringat\u016b&lt;/a&gt; religion.\nOn the night of the Census, 80.6% of people lived in households with only one family, 5.6% lived in households with other families, 9.6% lived in one-person households, and 4.2% lived in flats. On the same night, 55.1 percent of people lived in a two-parent family, 22.8 percent lived in a one-parent family, and 22.0 percent lived as couples without children. There were 1,008 dependent children in the iwi, compared to 939 in 2006. Of these 70.2% of these lived in two-parent families, compared to 66.5 percent in 2006."
