    "text": "The Bega Roosters are an Australian &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football team based in &lt;a href=\"Bega%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Bega&lt;/a&gt;, a coastal town of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29\"&gt;Far South Coast&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. The club was formed in 1960 as the result of the almagation of the Bega Rovers and the Bega West football clubs who were also both members of &lt;a href=\"Group%2016%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Group 16 Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter forming in 1960 from the Bega Rovers-Bega West merger, the club's first premiership came in their seventh season when Jim Gibson's men defeated Moruya 9\u20137 in the 1966 Grand Final.\nThe side then took back-to-back premierships in 1971 and 1972. The best years of the club came in the late 1980s when the side won five grand finals in six years including four straight from 1985 to 1988. The club would have to wait a decade before claiming back-to-back titles yet again in 2000 and 2001.\nName, colours, and emblem.\nBega plays in a red, blue and white predominant strip and were known as the tri-colours. Wearing a similar jersey to their &lt;a href=\"NSWRL\"&gt;NSWRL&lt;/a&gt; counter parts &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Easts (Sydney)&lt;/a&gt;, they adopted their nickname \"Roosters\". The emblem is of a Rooster running with a football wearing a tri-colours jersey. The name \"Bega Roosters\" is inscribed underneath. This is similar to the logo of the Sydney City Roosters in the late 1990s.\nHome ground.\nThe Bega Roosters play out of the Bega Recreation Ground for their home games."
