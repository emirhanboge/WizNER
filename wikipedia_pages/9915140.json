    "text": "Stoneyburn Junior Football Club are a Scottish &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Stoneyburn\"&gt;Stoneyburn&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Bathgate\"&gt;Bathgate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Lothian\"&gt;West Lothian&lt;/a&gt;. They currently play in the &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland Football League&lt;/a&gt;. Their home ground is Beechwood Park.\nThe original Stoneyburn club were founded in 1928 and enjoyed fair success in the 1930s and 1940s. The club reached the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-finals in 1950, where they finally lost 4\u20132 after a second replay to eventual winners &lt;a href=\"Blantyre%20Victoria%20F.C.\"&gt;Blantyre Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, and won the &lt;a href=\"East%20Junior%20Football%20League\"&gt;Midlothian Junior League&lt;/a&gt; in 1934\u201335 and 1938\u201339. During this era, the club built up the ground at Beechwood Park using spoil material from the nearby Foulshiels Colliery, after which their nickname, \"the Fulshie\" is derived. Despite some record crowds in this era of 12,000 for big cup matches, the club hit hard times and folded in 1958. The current side joined the SJFA in 1983 after some years in the Juvenile and Amateur levels. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;SJFA&lt;/a&gt; restructured prior to the 2006\u201307 season, and Stoneyburn found themselves in the 15-team &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20South%20Division\"&gt;East Region, South Division&lt;/a&gt;. They finished 13th in their first season in the division.\nThe team are managed since April 2018 by Allan Fleming."
