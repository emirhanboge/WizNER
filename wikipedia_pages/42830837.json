The game contains six modes; these modes are Classic mode; the Arcade mode; the Zen mode; the Rush mode; the Arcade+ mode (which includes the Bomb, Lightning, Bilayer, and Double tiles); and the Relay mode. In late April 2014 the game was the most downloaded application on both the iOS and Android platforms. In early July it was released for &lt;a href=\"Windows%20Phone\"&gt;Windows Phone&lt;/a&gt;.\nA sequel, \"&lt;a href=\"Piano%20Tiles%202\"&gt;Piano Tiles 2&lt;/a&gt;\", was created by Hu Wen Zeng and launched by Cheetah Mobile on August 19, 2015.\nGameplay.\n\"Piano Tiles\" is a game where the player's objective is to tap on the black tiles as they appear from the top of the screen while avoiding the white. \nWhen each black tile is tapped, it will emit a piano sound. In quick succession, forms famous compositions such as \"&lt;a href=\"F%C3%BCr%20Elise\"&gt;F\u00fcr Elise&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20to%20Joy\"&gt;Ode to Joy&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Bluestone Alley,\" composed by Congfei Wei, is an original composition for &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Tiles%202\"&gt;piano tiles 2&lt;/a&gt;, other songs by Congfei Wei is Aurora and Forest of Blocks. If the player taps on a white tile, the player will lose the game and be signaled by an off-tune note.\nModes.\nThere is a set number of tiles the player must touch to win. The screen moves manually, at the rate which the tiles are touched. The player may attempt to touch these tiles in as little time as possible.\nThe tiles on the screen automatically move and the player must keep up with the pace. The game lasts until one tile is missed in between, or a white tile is tapped. It contains a wide variety of variants, all of which are in a similar mode known as Arcade+ Mode. Piano Tiles 2 use only arcade mode per songs with some long tile tap, double tiles, rapid tiles and slide tiles and however after 3 stars the speed is constantly increasing as earning crowns and song loop.\nThere is a set time limit and the player may attempt to press as many tiles as possible before the time runs out. As with classic mode, the screen moves at the rate which black tiles are pressed.\nThe screen scrolls automatically, similar to arcade mode. The scroll speed gradually increases and the player is forced to tap tiles at a continuously increasing pace. The player inevitably loses, at which point the game reveals how many tiles per second the player was able to touch. \"Piano Tiles 2\" is primarily based on Rush Mode, featuring different songs.\nSimilar to zen mode, but the time limit can be reset by tapping tiles. If the player is unable to tap fifty tiles before the time runs out, the game ends. The screen moves at the player's pace in the same way as classic and zen mode.\nAll tiles move the same as in Arcade mode with added extras.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Bomb \u2013 Tiles with skull and cross bones should not be tapped. If tapped the game ends.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Lightning \u2013 The screen goes dark. Then lightning goes on the screen.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 The Dress \u2013 The tiles are striped black and blue. Same as bomb but the tiles increased speed it get lighter that makes the obstacle tiles unpreventable.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Double \u2013 Every so often 2 tiles will appear next to each other. Many of the songs in Piano Tiles 2 have double tiles, &lt;a href=\"Cs%C3%A1rd%C3%A1s%20%28Monti%29\"&gt;Csardas&lt;/a&gt; is one of the song has most consecutive double tiles.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Billayer \u2013 Every so often a tile with 2 horizontal white lines will appear. This tile must be tapped twice.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Mist \u2013 Every so often a mist will appear over the tiles.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Unstable \u2013 The speed of the tiles changes often.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Rotatory \u2013 Every so often the game will reverse and then change back again.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Shaky \u2013 Every so often the game will shake.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Cloudy \u2013 A row of cloud goes in front of the player.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Shift \u2013 Every so often a tile will move along the row.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Change \u2013 Every so often a tile will change places.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the success of the game and its sequel, the game and its modes were copied many times."
