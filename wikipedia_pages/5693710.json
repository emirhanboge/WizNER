He left the club on 24 March 2004; Austria Wien were in first place at the time of his departure.\n2004\u20132006: Germany assistant manager.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt; succeeded &lt;a href=\"Rudi%20V%C3%B6ller\"&gt;Rudi V\u00f6ller&lt;/a&gt; as the head coach of the &lt;a href=\"German%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany national team&lt;/a&gt; following a disappointing &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;, he brought L\u00f6w into the German setup as assistant manager. Klinsmann and L\u00f6w had met years earlier at a coaching school and both shared a philosophy focused on attacking football. Under their reign, Klinsmann and L\u00f6w's German team reached the semi-final stage at the &lt;a href=\"2005%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2005 FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nGermany lost 3\u20132 to &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final of the 2005 Confederations Cup, but subsequently defeated &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20133 in the third place encounter. Klinsmann and L\u00f6w's new attacking philosophy saw Germany score the most goals (15 in 5 matches) of any team in the tournament.\nGermany opened the 2006 World Cup on 9 June in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; with a 4\u20132 victory against &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; in an exciting match. A last minute 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and a 3\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Ecuador%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; followed. Germany defeated &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Germany%20vs%20Sweden\"&gt;round of 16&lt;/a&gt; with two &lt;a href=\"Lukas%20Podolski\"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt; goals, followed by a &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Germany%20vs%20Argentina\"&gt;grueling battle&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. In the penalty shootout after finishing extra time at 1\u20131, the coaching staff gave &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Lehmann\"&gt;Jens Lehmann&lt;/a&gt; a prepared list of possible Argentinian penalty takers and their preferred way to shoot, which was reported to have helped ensure Germany's victory. The &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Germany%20vs%20Italy\"&gt;semi-final&lt;/a&gt; match with &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; was a disappointment however, with the hosts conceding two goals in the final two minutes of extra time. Germany, however, turned in a dominant performance against &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Third%20place%20%E2%80%93%20Germany%20vs%20Portugal\"&gt;third place match&lt;/a&gt;, winning 3\u20131 with two &lt;a href=\"Bastian%20Schweinsteiger\"&gt;Bastian Schweinsteiger&lt;/a&gt; goals.\nBesides a focus on attacking football and youth development, Klinsmann's staff also introduced an alternative B-team: &lt;a href=\"Team%202006\"&gt;Team 2006&lt;/a&gt;, to experiment with new aspiring players suitable to play at the home World Cup. Also introduced were an enhanced fitness coaching staff, as well as &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Bierhoff\"&gt;Oliver Bierhoff&lt;/a&gt; as \"Business Manager\" \u2013 this job revolves around public relations, general management and everything not directly related to coaching \u2013 and finally a mental coach, Dr. Hans-Dieter Hermann, who has the job of preparing the German players for stressful situations in major tournaments.\n2006\u20132021: Germany manager.\nEuro 2008.\nOn 12 July 2006, following Klinsmann's decision not to renew his contract, L\u00f6w was named as the new manager of Germany. L\u00f6w obtained a contract for two years and announced that he wanted to continue in the philosophy developed with Klinsmann to play with an offensive style. L\u00f6w was particularly concerned with the amount of time his players hold on to the ball before passing. During his tenure, he reduced this time significantly, increasing the pace of the German game. He declared that his aim was to win &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008\"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt;. His first game in charge, a friendly against Sweden in &lt;a href=\"Gelsenkirchen\"&gt;Gelsenkirchen&lt;/a&gt; on 16 August 2006, was a 3\u20130 success in which &lt;a href=\"Miroslav%20Klose\"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt; scored twice and &lt;a href=\"Bernd%20Schneider%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Bernd Schneider&lt;/a&gt; scored the other.\nL\u00f6w had a successful start in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying\"&gt;qualifying for Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; with wins over the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Marino%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;San Marino&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 October 2006, Germany won 2\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ostseestadion\"&gt;Ostseestadion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rostock\"&gt;Rostock&lt;/a&gt;, which was the fourth consecutive success for L\u00f6w and his team, the best start of a new head coach of the German national team ever. The team extended this record to five wins in the next match, the Euro 2008 qualifier against &lt;a href=\"Slovakia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; in Bratislava on 11 October, with a 4\u20131 victory. The Slovaks' strike was the first goal conceded by Germany under L\u00f6w's reign.\nThe next match saw the end of L\u00f6w's perfect record, with the qualifying match on 15 November in &lt;a href=\"Nicosia\"&gt;Nicosia&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; ending in a disappointing 1\u20131 draw. 2007 started with a 3\u20131 win against Switzerland on 7 February and a 2\u20131 win against the Czech Republic on 24 March. L\u00f6w's first loss as manager came in his eighth game on 28 March 2007, an experimental squad lost 0\u20131 against &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. He had given &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Enke\"&gt;Robert Enke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Helmes\"&gt;Patrick Helmes&lt;/a&gt; their debuts. When qualification for Euro 2008 was ensured, L\u00f6w's record stood at 11 wins, 1 loss and 1 draw from 13 matches and a 41:6 goal difference. This includes the first win over &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Germany lost to the Czech Republic in qualifying on 17 October 2007. This was the second loss for L\u00f6w. Germany finished qualifying in second place. In the final match of 2007, Germany and &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; finished in a 0\u20130 draw.\nGermany started 2008 with 3\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Austria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; on 6 February and a 4\u20130 win against Switzerland on 26 March. Then Germany and &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; finished in a 2\u20132 draw. Germany had a 2\u20130 lead at half\u2013time. In their final match before Euro 2008, Germany defeated &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131. At Euro 2008, Germany defeated Poland 2\u20130 in their first game, with two goals from Lukas Podolski. In their second game, Germany were beaten 2\u20131 by &lt;a href=\"Croatia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, while in their final group game, against Austria, L\u00f6w was sent to the stands by the referee &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Mejuto%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Manuel Mejuto Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 along with his Austrian counterpart &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Hickersberger\"&gt;Josef Hickersberger&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 for arguing with the fourth official. Following his dismissal, he was seen talking to &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Chancellor of Germany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Merkel\"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; about the incident. Nonetheless, Germany won the match 1\u20130 with a goal from &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Ballack\"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt; to progress to the quarter-finals as runners up because of their earlier loss to Croatia.\nL\u00f6w changed the 4\u20134\u20132 system after the group stages to a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 system, and left striker &lt;a href=\"Mario%20G%C3%B3mez\"&gt;Mario G\u00f3mez&lt;/a&gt; out of the starting lineup. Though he was forced to watch from the sidelines, his team defeated Portugal 3\u20132. In the quarter-final, L\u00f6w was banned from giving any directions to his team even through telephone calls. Later L\u00f6w declared that he had put seven different scenarios with his assistant &lt;a href=\"Hansi%20Flick\"&gt;Hansi Flick&lt;/a&gt; in order to contain Portugal. In an exciting match against &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-finals, Germany won 3\u20132. Germany then lost 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Spain%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; on 29 June 2008.\n2010 World Cup.\nFurther progress was evident in &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt; for South Africa as Germany booked their place at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; undefeated. In their penultimate match on 10 October 2009, Germany secured first place in their &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%204\"&gt;qualifying group&lt;/a&gt; for the 2010 World Cup by beating second placed &lt;a href=\"Russia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130, sending &lt;a href=\"Guus%20Hiddink\"&gt;Guus Hiddink&lt;/a&gt;'s side into &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Second%20Round\"&gt;playoffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, L\u00f6w introduced new young players and fielded the second youngest team of the tournament, Germany's youngest since 1934. Germany topped &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20D\"&gt;Group D&lt;/a&gt; and met England in the first round of the knockout stage, beating them 4\u20131 before defeating Argentina 4\u20130 in the quarter-finals. Germany then lost the semi-final to Spain 1\u20130. On 10 July 2010, they went on to win the third place play-off against &lt;a href=\"Uruguay%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; by 3\u20132 to collect the bronze medals and third place at the 2010 World Cup.\nEuro 2012.\nGermany &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012%20qualifying\"&gt;qualified&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt; and topped their &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012%20qualifying%20Group%20A\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; with ten wins out of ten matches.
