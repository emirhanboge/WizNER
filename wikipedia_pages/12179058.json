The artist cooperative was originally granted use of the space for only six months. After this time the structure was scheduled for demolition. However, as of September 2008 the building has yet to be demolished and the gallery has expanded use of the structure to include artists\u2019 studios.\nThe gallery was voted the 2006 \u201cBest Art Gallery\u201d in Baltimore by the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20City%20Paper\"&gt;Baltimore City Paper&lt;/a&gt;. It has also served as an exhibition venue for the annual Baltimore &lt;a href=\"Artscape%20%28festival%29\"&gt;Artscape&lt;/a&gt; festival. The cooperative has played host to multiple up-and-coming &lt;a href=\"indie%20rock\"&gt;indie rock&lt;/a&gt; performers, such as &lt;a href=\"Beach%20House%20%28band%29\"&gt;Beach House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Deacon\"&gt;Dan Deacon&lt;/a&gt;."
