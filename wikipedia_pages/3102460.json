In November 1976, the first party of railway builders arrived at the site of the future city and camped out by &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Khanto\"&gt;Lake Khanto&lt;/a&gt; with the task of creating a settlement. On October\u00a026, 1977, the settlement of Noyabrsk, which grew around the &lt;a href=\"train%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; of Noyabrskaya, was officially registered. It was decided to choose the name of \"Noyabrsk\" instead of the other proposal, \"Khanto\", to perpetuate the memory of the first arrival in November 1976, as the Russian word for November is \"\" (\"noyabr\"). The settlement was granted &lt;a href=\"urban-type%20settlement\"&gt;work settlement&lt;/a&gt; status on November\u00a012, 1979 and that of a town on April\u00a028, 1982.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions\"&gt;framework of administrative divisions&lt;/a&gt;, it is incorporated as the &lt;a href=\"city%20of%20federal%20subject%20significance\"&gt;city of okrug significance&lt;/a&gt; of Noyabrsk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20divisions%20of%20Yamalo-Nenets%20Autonomous%20Okrug\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;.

With its opening in the early 1990s and with oil and gas industry maintaining relatively high living standards in the economic turmoil of Post-Soviet Russia, illicit drug business became highly profitable, drawing criminal elements from other regions. The situation was compounded by the police and officials being &lt;a href=\"political%20corruption\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; and ill-equipped to tackle the problem and by the general lack of occupations for the teenagers. The drug abuse situation in Noyabrsk was covered on national TV and in other media and finally official and citizen organisations arose to fight the problem.\nOn March\u00a017, 2009, a criminal case against the mayor Nikolay Korobkov was sent to court. According to the prosecution, he transferred some municipal property to a private company when he didn't have the power to do so.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nNoyabrsk is &lt;a href=\"Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
