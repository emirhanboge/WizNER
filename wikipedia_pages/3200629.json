    "text": "The Anastasian Wall (&lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;: , ) or the Long Walls of Thrace (Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70 \u03a4\u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u0398\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, Turkish: \"Uzun Duvar\") is an ancient stone and turf &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt; located west of &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, built by the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the late 5th century.\nConstruction.\nOriginally some long, it stretches from Evcik \u0130skelesi in &lt;a href=\"%C3%87atalca\"&gt;\u00c7atalca&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast across the &lt;a href=\"Thrace\"&gt;Thracian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"peninsula\"&gt;peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Marmara\"&gt;Sea of Marmara&lt;/a&gt; at west of &lt;a href=\"Silivri\"&gt;Silivri&lt;/a&gt; (ancient Selymbria). It ran from north to south through the locations what are today Karacak\u00f6y, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fp\u0131nar, P\u0131narca, Kurfall\u0131, Fener, Alipa\u015fa Neighborhood and Silivri Alt\u0131norak. Remains of the wall are visible in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fp\u0131nar junction in Karacak\u00f6y, Hisartepe in Yal\u0131k\u00f6y, P\u0131narca in \u0130hsaniye and Kurfall\u0131 village. The wall was part of an additional outer defense system for &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and probably continued in use until the 7th century.\nThe wall was named after the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Anastasius%20I%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Anastasius I&lt;/a&gt; (). However, there is evidence that the fortification already existed in 469 during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Leo%20I%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Leo I&lt;/a&gt; () and in 478 in the era of &lt;a href=\"Zeno%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Zeno&lt;/a&gt; (), and it was maintained and renewed by Anastasius in the time from 507 to 512. The wall had a thickness of and a height over . It was built complete with towers, gates, forts, ditches and a military way to protect Constantinople from invasions from the west by &lt;a href=\"Huns\"&gt;Huns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bulgars\"&gt;Bulgars&lt;/a&gt;. A rectangular \"&lt;a href=\"castrum\"&gt;castrum&lt;/a&gt;\" with dimensions of by existed also in the central section of the wall.\nEffectiveness.\nIt is known that the wall had only a limited effectiveness, and the &lt;a href=\"barbarians\"&gt;barbarians&lt;/a&gt; penetrated it many times, because the fortification's length made it difficult to defend the wall completely by a limited &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and also because the wall was not sufficiently strong due to its hasty construction.\nThe wall fell into ruin after it was abandoned in the 7th century because of the difficulty of keeping it manned and repaired. Over the centuries, the stone of more than half of the total length was reused in other local buildings. It is best preserved in the woodlands of the northern sector."
