    "text": "The 43 Group was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; group set up by &lt;a href=\"British%20Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; ex-servicemen after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. They did this when, upon returning to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, they encountered &lt;a href=\"British%20Fascism\"&gt;British fascist&lt;/a&gt; organisations such as &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Hamm\"&gt;Jeffrey Hamm&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"British%20League%20of%20Ex-Servicemen\"&gt;British League of Ex-Servicemen&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20Mosley\"&gt;Oswald Mosley&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"fascist\"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; party, the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Movement\"&gt;Union Movement&lt;/a&gt;. The activities of these fascist groups included &lt;a href=\"antisemitic\"&gt;antisemitic&lt;/a&gt; speeches in public places, and from the rank-and-file fascists, violent attacks on &lt;a href=\"London%20Jews\"&gt;London Jews&lt;/a&gt; and Jewish property. Group members broke up &lt;a href=\"far-right\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt; meetings, infiltrated fascist groups, and attacked the fascists in &lt;a href=\"street%20fighting\"&gt;street fighting&lt;/a&gt;. \nTheir newspaper, \"On Guard\", was published from 1947 to 1949. \nEarly history and activities.\nThe name \"43 Group\" came from the number of people in the room of &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20World%20Union\"&gt;Maccabi&lt;/a&gt; House (a Jewish sports centre in &lt;a href=\"Hampstead%2C%20London\"&gt;Hampstead, London&lt;/a&gt;) during the group's founding meeting in April 1946. Those who convened the initial meeting included:\nThe 17-year-old &lt;a href=\"Vidal%20Sassoon\"&gt;Vidal Sassoon&lt;/a&gt; joined the group and later joined the &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20Defence%20Forces\"&gt;Israeli Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt; to fight in the &lt;a href=\"1948%20Arab-Israeli%20War\"&gt;1948 Arab-Israeli War&lt;/a&gt;. Sassoon later founded a multinational hair styling business.\nThe initial membership was around 300 people. The group grew to include many hundreds of men and women, not all Jewish. Many among them had been decorated for bravery, including the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;VC&lt;/a&gt; (Petty Officer &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20William%20Gould\"&gt;Tommy Gould&lt;/a&gt;), DSO, DFC, DSM, and MM. The organisation was sometimes portrayed by its enemies as a front for either Jewish &lt;a href=\"terrorist\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;s, but in fact it was mostly composed of British ex-servicemen.\nThe group published \"On Guard\", from July 1947 to December 1949, an anti-fascist paper which often published intelligence gathered by Group spies. As well as covering the activities of Oswald Mosley and the British fascists, \"On Guard\" reported on the activities of fascists all around the world and racist injustices in countries including the USA and South Africa.\nRelationship with other organisations.\nThe 43 Group was viewed by established Jewish organisations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews\"&gt;Board of Deputies of British Jews&lt;/a&gt;, as a competitor. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also worried that the 43 Group's activities could damage the Jewish community's reputation, especially in light of the terrorist acts and &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt; carried out by militant &lt;a href=\"Zionist\"&gt;Zionist&lt;/a&gt; groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Irgun\"&gt;Irgun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;British Mandate Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. However, the 43 Group never sought to replace the more traditional groups who preferred debate and discussion, but who had failed to stop the BUF, partly due to the non-cooperation of the then British &lt;a href=\"Home%20Secretary\"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Chuter%20Ede\"&gt;James Chuter Ede&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, 43 Group sought to prevent the Union Movement mobilising and gathering support, remembering that the &lt;a href=\"National%20Socialist%20German%20Workers%20Party\"&gt;Nazi party&lt;/a&gt; had gained prominence in a similar fashion as the &lt;a href=\"Sturmabteilung\"&gt;Brownshirts&lt;/a&gt; on the streets of post-World War I Germany.\nDissolution and impact.\nThe 43 Group was voluntarily disbanded on 4 June 1950, as its members considered that the immediate threat had passed. Although Mosley's Union Movement remained active throughout the 1950s, it was not until 1962, when the unrelated &lt;a href=\"62%20Group\"&gt;62 Group&lt;/a&gt; was formed in the 43 Group's image, that British fascists again encountered any significant privately organised street-level resistance.\nThe overall effect of 43 Group is unclear. Morris Beckman argued that it was crucial in stopping a resurgence of fascism in post-war Britain. The 43 group was undoubtedly an inspiration to other militant &lt;a href=\"anti-fascist\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; groups such as the &lt;a href=\"62%20Group\"&gt;62 Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anti-Fascist%20Action\"&gt;Anti-Fascist Action&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nIn 2004, the group was the subject of &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%204\"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt; programme \"A Rage in Dalston\", part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Archive%20Hour\"&gt;The Archive Hour&lt;/a&gt; series, presented by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Dein\"&gt;Alan Dein&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn September 2015, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"BBC2\"&gt;BBC2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; were co-developing a six-part drama series alongside surviving members of The 43 Group and produced by The Tenafly Film Company and Tiger Aspect Drama, but the series was not made."
