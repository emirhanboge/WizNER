    "text": "Country house opera is &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; performed at a &lt;a href=\"English%20country%20house\"&gt;country house&lt;/a&gt;, whether in the house itself, in the grounds, or in an adapted or purpose built theatre on the grounds. It is a feature in particular of the English summer. Country house opera is usually initiated by private enthusiasts, and relies almost exclusively upon private funding. This distinguishes it from the UK's state subsidised opera companies which, like most opera houses around the world, are based in city centres. &lt;a href=\"Black%20tie\"&gt;Black tie&lt;/a&gt; is often \"de rigueur\", in contrast with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in London and other city operas where casual clothing is often acceptable.\nThe performances of country house opera are generally planned to provide a leisurely and elegant experience, with time for picnics on the lawns or a full meal during the often-lengthy interval, and often start in the late afternoon:\nThe most important landmark in country house opera was the opening of &lt;a href=\"Glyndebourne%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Glyndebourne Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in 1934. The &lt;a href=\"Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera\"&gt;Glyndebourne Festival Opera&lt;/a&gt; company has gradually expanded so that it now has a 1,200-seat theatre and it has become one of the most prominent opera companies in the United Kingdom, performing both at its home venue and on tour.\nWhile other companies, which put on a regular summer season often include works from the standard repertoire, some specialise in particular composers or particular periods. Existing companies include &lt;a href=\"Garsington%20Opera\"&gt;Garsington Opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20Opera%20Festival\"&gt;Dorset Opera Festival&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bryanston\"&gt;Bryanston&lt;/a&gt; in Dorset, &lt;a href=\"Nevill%20Holt%20Opera\"&gt;Nevill Holt Opera&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nevill%20Holt\"&gt;Nevill Holt&lt;/a&gt; Hall in Leicestershire, &lt;a href=\"Longborough%20Festival%20Opera\"&gt;Longborough Festival Opera&lt;/a&gt; in Gloucestershire, &lt;a href=\"Grange%20Park%20Opera\"&gt;Grange Park Opera&lt;/a&gt; in Surrey, &lt;a href=\"Bampton%20Classical%20Opera\"&gt;Bampton Classical Opera&lt;/a&gt; and Waterperry Opera Festival in Oxfordshire, Bury Court Opera in Bentley near Farnham, Surrey, &lt;a href=\"The%20Grange%20Festival\"&gt;The Grange Festival&lt;/a&gt; at Northington, Hampshire and &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20de%20Baug%C3%A9\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra de Baug\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, established by an English family in the &lt;a href=\"Loire%20Valley\"&gt;Loire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, France. The country opera house tradition has inspired opera performances in similar settings outside England, such as &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A5lboga%20Summer%20Opera\"&gt;St\u00e5lboga Summer Opera&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden.\nThere are also a number of touring companies that tour to several country houses each summer, which include Opera Project, \"a touring company that plays at West Green, Iford Manor and many other venues round the country.\"\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"
