    "text": "Lindlar ( ) is a municipality in the &lt;a href=\"Oberbergischer%20Kreis\"&gt;Oberbergischer Kreis&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It is located about 30\u00a0km east of &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLindlar is located between latitudes 50\u00b058' and 51\u00b05' N. and longitudes 7\u00b015' and 7\u00b028' E. The highest point at 361.8 ms is found near Oberlichtinghagen, the lowest at 110 ms near Oberbilstein.\nNeighbouring places.\nNeighbouring towns are &lt;a href=\"Gummersbach\"&gt;Gummersbach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wipperf%C3%BCrth\"&gt;Wipperf\u00fcrth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overath\"&gt;Overath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bergisch%20Gladbach\"&gt;Bergisch Gladbach&lt;/a&gt;, and the neighbouring municipalities are &lt;a href=\"Engelskirchen\"&gt;Engelskirchen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marienheide\"&gt;Marienheide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%C3%BCrten\"&gt;K\u00fcrten&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivision of the municipality.\nThe municipality of Lindlar is made up of these main villages: Lindlar (local centre), Frielingsdorf, Linde, Hohkeppel, Schmitzh\u00f6he, Hartegasse/Kapellens\u00fcng.\nThe coat of arms of Lindlar.\nThe arms were granted on 6 August 1935. The arms show in the upper part the lion of the Counts of Berg and in the lower the balance as a symbol of justice. Lindlar had its own court in the County Berg. The arms are based on the old seal of the court and village of Lindlar.\nTwin town.\nLindlar is twinned with Shaftesbury Dorset England, and &lt;a href=\"Ka%C5%A1tela\"&gt;Ka\u0161tela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSettlement and first naming.\nIt is likely that the area around Lindlar was settled in the stone age. While there is no ultimate proof for that, neolithic artifacts were found near Kemmerich and Fenke. Until the Middle Ages the area was covered with virgin forests; it can therefore be assumed that only few people, such as hunters, settled there.\nThe eldest available records mentioning Lindlar -then known as Lintlo- date back to the year 1109. But as an older document from the year 958 cites the transferral of the Kaldenkapellen -now Hohkeppel- church to the Severinsstift in Cologne and as the former was then provably subordinated to the parish church in Lindlar, this church must have already existed in that year or even up to a few decades earlier.\nTill 1815.\nThe tower of the parish church of Lindlar was built in the 12th century and remains till today, although the tower's roof was built in the 18th century. A nave was lustrated in the year of 1500, and the present nave was built in 1826. The village of Lindlar was centred around the church.\nIn the course of time more and more woods were stubed, both by the farmers and on order of the landlords. Centers of the expansion were the so-called \"Fronh\u00f6fe\" and the \"Herrenh\u00f6fe\". Here the farmers had to pay their tenth and the work of courts and administration were done.\nThe \"Bergische Land\" was divided in departments and circuits. The area around Lindlar, including Wipperfeld, Bechen, K\u00fcrten, Olpe, Lindlar, Overath, Engelskirchen, Hohkeppel and Wipperf\u00fcrth formed the department of Steinbach. Steinbach is a small village next to Lindlar and was named after the castle of Steinbach.\nIn this time a county court was set up in Lindlar. In 1440 Hohkeppel and in 1554 Engelskirchen had their own parish churches.\nIn 1806 Napoleon bestowed upon the county of Berg the honour of being a grand duchy. The county court in Lindlar remained, but was renamed in \"Friedensgericht\". Furthermore, the \"canton Lindlar\" was formed.\n1815\u20131870.\nAfter 1815 the whole Rhineland became part of Preu\u00dfen and the \"district Wipperf\u00fcrth\" was set up. In 1828 the population of Lindlar was 5430, 5396 were Catholic and only 34 Protestants.\n1871\u20131918.\nIn 1882 an auxiliary fire brigade in Lindlar was arranged. A new building for the county court in Lindlar had to be built in 1895. In 1897 the municipal council first reflected upon the idea of a railway connection to Lindlar. The idea was to build a connection to Immekeppel where a train to Cologne departed and arrived. In 1906 this was allowed by the government and the railway Cologne \u2013 Bergisch Gladbach \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Immekeppel\"&gt;Immekeppel&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Lindlar was opened in 1912. There were several elementary schools in Lindlar: in the town of Lindlar, Linde, Waldbruch, S\u00fcng, Frielingsdorf, Hohkeppel, Schmitzh\u00f6he and Kalkofen. Since the priest Johannes Fischer and the carpenter Christian MIebach gave their legacy for a new hospital, a hospital was built in Lindlar and opened in 1891.\nIn 1904 a new townhall was built.\nCulture.\nChurch municipalities.\nUp to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; Lindlar was predominantly a Catholic, Protestant inhabitant had to be established on account of the increased number in 1956 a Protestant church. In addition, at the beginning 1990s a Protestant free church and a neuapastolische church settled.\nNow thus there is in Lindlar:\nCultural facilities.\nLindlar disposes of a great cultural centre (more than 800 places) in the regularly theatrical arrangement and music arrangements take place. Smaller arrangements help themselves of the council hall \" old school \" in Eichenhofstrasse.\nThe municipality library Lindlar houses a great choice of books and is helped financially by a conveyor association, so that the lending is free so far.\nMarkets.\nRegularly flea markets, art craftsman markets, farm markets take place in the Bergischen open-air museum as well as a Christmas fair. As a specific feature an old-timer market takes place in Lindlar - Schmitzh\u00f6he.\nMuseums.\nFrom the place lies there not far the Bergische open-air museum Lindlar, it is accessible about the RB25 and the bus line 331 or the SB40 from Cologne or Lindlar. Besides, in Lindlar-Altenrath there is a curiosity museum.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe municipality marks itself \"tourism municipality\" (resort and leisure place). The historical local cores of Lindlar, Hohkeppel and Linde are worth seeing. In addition, one sees with the walking on the extensive footpath net often one of the road crosses and also many smaller chapels.\nCastles.\nIn the local area lie the castle ruins \"Ruine Eibach\", \"Neuenberg\" and \"Unterheiligenhoven\", as well as this \"castle Heiligenhoven \" and the \"castle Georghausen \".\nChurches.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; \"Sankt Severin\" was built in the 12th century. There are old Catholic churches in Hohkeppel and Linde. The &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; church in Lindlar was built from 1954\u201356.\nMuseums.\nThe \"Bergische Freilichtmuseum Lindlar\" (an open-air museum about agriculture in the \"Bergisches Land\") and a \"Kuriosit\u00e4tenmuseum\" (a museum about oddities) are located in Lindlar.\nBuildings and monuments.\nLindlar, Marketplace\nLindlar, Ort\nmonuments in Lindlar\nChurches in Lindlar\nSchools and educational facilities.\nIn Lindlar are six elementary schools in different villages: Frielingsdorf, Kapellens\u00fcng, Linde, Schmitzh\u00f6he, Lindlar west and the Lindlar east.

Since 1999 cooperation with the Saint Josef hospital in Engelskirchen form of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; Kliniken Oberberg GmbH.\nSpare time and sport.\nLindlar has, as one of few &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipalities&lt;/a&gt;, its own leisure park. It was established between 1980 and 1982. There are a &lt;a href=\"swimming%20pool\"&gt;swimming pool&lt;/a&gt; (Parkbad Lindlar), a &lt;a href=\"crazy%20golf\"&gt;crazy golf&lt;/a&gt; layout, a &lt;a href=\"concert\"&gt;concert&lt;/a&gt; space, an adventure game space, boot rental &lt;a href=\"company%20%28law%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; as well as several investments is found for sport. The &lt;a href=\"leisure\"&gt;leisure&lt;/a&gt; park directly borders on the castle park of the Castle Heiligenhoven and on the Lindlarer cultural centre.\nThe municipality has more than seven sports fields, a stadium with field as well as one with Aschenplatz, seven &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt;nasiums, under it two big triple run halls and a gymnastics hall and two &lt;a href=\"tennis%20court\"&gt;tennis court&lt;/a&gt;s.

Most important are the protection associations, sports associations and native country &lt;a href=\"Voluntary%20association\"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy, industry and infrastructure.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th century the &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; industry was in the environment of Lindlar, and stood economically in high blossom. Numerous &lt;a href=\"iron%20hammer\"&gt;iron hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metallurgical%20furnace\"&gt;furnaces&lt;/a&gt; were run there whose remaining stocks are to be found today partially still. by the way, the &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the down-to-earth &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, the stone industry (reduction and processing of the greywacke), paper processing, home industry and &lt;a href=\"file%20cutting\"&gt;file cutting&lt;/a&gt; was maintained. In addition, in the beginning of the 1980s a settlement of company took place in the new industrial zone of Klause.\nLindlarer greywacke.\nFor more than 400 years it is diminished in Lindlar &lt;a href=\"greywacke\"&gt;greywacke&lt;/a&gt;. If this industry fork still hundred years ago was a main employer of the Lindlarer population, today only three producing &lt;a href=\"companies\"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; exist. In many places former stone quarries which are today an important living space for all sorts of animal species are found. The Lindlarer greywacke was used on site to the &lt;a href=\"construction\"&gt;construction&lt;/a&gt;, examples for this are the steeple of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; parish church Saint Severin. Also it was sold in the other environment, for instance, to &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. In this connection the Lindlarer &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; which transported the &lt;a href=\"rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; till the 1960s by railway is worth mentioning. For this target led from the main reduction area - a brake road.\nRoad network and public transport.\nHighway.\nLindlar about the federal &lt;a href=\"motorway\"&gt;motorway&lt;/a&gt; A4 (&lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olpe%2C%20Germany\"&gt;Olpe&lt;/a&gt;) is linked up to the highway net. At the best to use the motorway at exit &lt;a href=\"Engelskirchen\"&gt;Engelskirchen&lt;/a&gt; (in 7 kilometers of distance) or Overath-Untereschbach (15 kilometers).\nRailroad.\nThe next &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; is in Engelskirchen, Lindlar itself is not connected to railroads anymore. On the railroad line Lindlar - Linde - Hoffnungsthal - Cologne a private train was operated until October 1960. Freight transport followed on 23 May 1966. In 2005 the rails were dismantled as much as possible.\nBus connections and railroad connections.\nLindlar lies very traffic-favorable with the A4 (exit Untereschbach or Engelskirchen). Also public transport is developed according to line very well."
