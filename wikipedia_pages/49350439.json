Our loyal \"Wentworth\" fans are not going to be disappointed and I know our amazing cast and crew are going to relish bringing to life these potent stories.\"\nPenny Win, the Head of Drama at &lt;a href=\"Foxtel\"&gt;Foxtel&lt;/a&gt; stated, \"All of us at Foxtel and FremantleMedia Australia are extremely proud of \"Wentworth\" and the passionate bond the series has forged with drama lovers, starting with our discerning Foxtel subscribers and expanding to captivate audiences around the world.\"\nOn 5 November 2015, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Sigrid%20Thornton\"&gt;Sigrid Thornton&lt;/a&gt; would step through the gates of Wentworth Correctional Centre, becoming the first actress from the original series, \"&lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20Cell%20Block%20H\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;\" to play a major re-occurring role in the reimagination. Moreover, she also plays Sonia Stevens, an inmate featured in the original series, albeit played by &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Bursill\"&gt;Tina Bursill&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf Sigrid's casting, Penny Win stated, \"\"Wentworth\"'s fourth season continues the series' finely-honed evolution as a world class contemporary drama which proudly forges its own path, while fearlessly daring to reimagine characters and elements of the iconic Prisoner series. Having Sigrid Thornton sign on to return behind the walls of Wentworth is a casting dream and a wonderful acknowledgement of the work the writing team has put into the creation of Sonia Stevens and our plans for her and all our characters.\"\nJo Porter stated, \"Sigrid was always on the top of our casting wish list \u2013 adored and admired by audiences for the strong women she has chosen to portray. From the second Sonia Stevens steps from the brawler, there is an unsettling sense all is not as it may seem. I am sure audiences will relish watching Sonia\u2019s long game play out across season four.\""
