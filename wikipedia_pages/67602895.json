As of the 2021\u201322 season, it competes in the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9gional%202\"&gt;R\u00e9gional 2&lt;/a&gt;, the seventh tier of French football.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded as US Melun in 1894.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the club competed mostly in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Division%203%20%281971%E2%80%931993%29\"&gt;Division 3&lt;/a&gt;, but reached the &lt;a href=\"Ligue%202\"&gt;Division 2&lt;/a&gt; on two occasions, during the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20French%20Division%202\"&gt;1977\u201378&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20French%20Division%202\"&gt;1987\u201388&lt;/a&gt; seasons. The second occasion the club reached the Division 2, it was as &lt;a href=\"Entente%20Melun-Fontainebleau%2077\"&gt;Entente Melun-Fontainebleau 77&lt;/a&gt;, the club that formed from a merger in 1987 between &lt;a href=\"RCP%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;CS Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt; and US Melun. However, in 1988, the Entente split, and Melun merged with Dammarie-l\u00e8s-Lys to create a new club called in Sporting Melun-Dammarie 77. In 1992, the club took the new name of FC Melun and was administratively relegated several divisions."
