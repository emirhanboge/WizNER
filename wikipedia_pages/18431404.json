    "text": "Sarah Thompson, Countess Rumford, (18 October 1774 \u2013 2 December 1852) was a &lt;a href=\"philanthropist\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt;. She is the first American to be known as a &lt;a href=\"Countess\"&gt;Countess&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nThompson was the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"English-American\"&gt;Anglo-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physicist\"&gt;physicist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inventor\"&gt;inventor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Thompson\"&gt;Benjamin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and of Sarah Rolfe, a rich and well-connected heiress, who was thirteen years older than her husband. Both were born and brought up in the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;colonies&lt;/a&gt; and married there in 1772.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; of 1775 to 1783, Benjamin Thompson took the side of the British, and at the end of the war he moved to London. He was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed in 1784. In 1785, when Sarah Thompson was eleven years old, her father moved to &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; to become an \"&lt;a href=\"aide-de-camp\"&gt;aide-de-camp&lt;/a&gt;\" to the &lt;a href=\"Prince-elector\"&gt;Prince-elector&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Theodore%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria\"&gt;Charles Theodore&lt;/a&gt;. She, however, remained in &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; with her mother.\nIn 1792, Sir Benjamin Thompson was created a &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He took the name \"Rumford\" for Rumford, New Hampshire, which was an older name for the town of &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;, where he had been married, becoming \"Count Rumford\".\nAdult life.\nAround 1796, at her father's request, Sarah Thompson traveled to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to be with him, since four years earlier her mother had died. In 1797, the Elector of Bavaria accepted Thompson as a Countess of the Holy Roman Empire. In recognition of her father's military services to Bavaria, she was to be given one half of his pension of 2000 &lt;a href=\"florin\"&gt;florin&lt;/a&gt;s upon his death, with the right to live in any country she wished. When her father died in 1814 she became \"Countess Rumford\". Thompson spent her time between her homes in &lt;a href=\"Brompton%2C%20London\"&gt;Brompton, London&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, with other trips in-between. She often would travel to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and lived there for two and three years.\nLater life.\nFrom 1845, Thompson lived primarily at her home in Concord, New Hampshire. She lived there in luxury with an adopted daughter until her death in 1852.\nThompson established the Rolfe and Rumford Asylums in Concord, New Hampshire. She provided assistance to and bequeathed large sums of money to charitable societies in Concord and Boston for needy children, motherless girls, widows, and the mentally ill. The &lt;a href=\"United%20Way%20of%20America\"&gt;United Way&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 founded the Rumford Society in honor of the charitable donations given by Thompson.\nHer gravestone monument reads,"
