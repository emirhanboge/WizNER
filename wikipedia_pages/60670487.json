While pursuing his career in piloting private planes, he encountered Mexican aircraft used for drug cartels, which provided inspiration for his short story \"Safe Home.\"\nAs an undergraduate student, Pe\u00f1a planned to go to law school, but changed his goal once he studied under &lt;a href=\"National%20Book%20Award\"&gt;National Book Award&lt;/a&gt;-winning author &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Heinemann\"&gt;Larry Heinemann&lt;/a&gt;, who encouraged him to write.

He received a &lt;a href=\"Fulbright\"&gt;Fulbright&lt;/a&gt; scholarship and committed his research and studies to the drug war in America and its lasting impact on Mexico. During this time, his writings focused primarily on drug trafficking and his political perspective on militarized borders.\nCareer.\nPe\u00f1a was based out at the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20Nacional%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20de%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt; (UNAM) in Mexico City, where he worked as a writer, blogger, book reviewer and journalist as a Fulbright-Garc\u00eda Robles scholar. He was also a former Picador Guest Professor in Leipzig, Germany. He taught English courses at Cornell and &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; before arriving at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Houston%E2%80%93Downtown\"&gt;University of Houston\u2013Downtown&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant professor in the Department of English in 2016.

His novel \"Bang\" provides insight on the struggles of undocumented immigrants and the everyday and interpersonal negative effects of deregulating capital markets and lowering trade barriers in international trade, especially in regard to NAFTA. He also brings into discussion how American immigration policy and America's drug war in Mexico are inextricably interlinked."
