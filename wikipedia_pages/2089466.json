    "text": "George Hawi (; born 5 November 1938 \u2013 21 June 2005) was a &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; and former secretary general of the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Lebanese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (LCP). An outspoken critic of Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, he was killed in 2005 by a bomb placed under the passenger seat of his car. Lebanese people accused the Syrian government of assassinating him. He was the stepfather of the Lebanese Armenian politician Rafi Madayan, who also has a stepson, Charbel Khalifeh Hachem.\nEarly life and career.\nGeorge Hawi was born in the village of &lt;a href=\"Bteghrine\"&gt;Bteghrine&lt;/a&gt;, Lebanon on 5 November 1938 to a Lebanese family. Although born into an Antiochian Greek Orthodox Christian family, Hawi was a professed &lt;a href=\"atheist\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe became active in student politics in his early years at university, participating in numerous &lt;a href=\"Strike%20action\"&gt;strikes&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrations and in several &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;popular movement&lt;/a&gt;s. He joined the LCP in 1955 and became one of the main leaders of its Student League by the end of the decade. In 1955 he became a member of the LCP which had been illegal in Lebanon. \nIn 1964, he was imprisoned for his involvement in a strike against Lebanon's state-controlled &lt;a href=\"tobacco\"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer. In 1969 he was again in prison for participation in a demonstration on 23 April in support of the &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20territories\"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; cause, and again in 1970 for his part in attacking an &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Lebanon\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; detachment.\nHawi was briefly expelled from the LCP in 1967 for calling for more independence from the policies of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. He rejoined the Party and was elected a member of its political bureau in the second and third congresses in 1968 and 1972. Hawi was elected as the general secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Lebanese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; after its fourth congress in 1979 \u2013 a position he kept until 1993 when he resigned. He was the fourth general secretary of the party following &lt;a href=\"Fuad%20Shemali\"&gt;Fuad Shemali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farajallah%20el-Helou\"&gt;Farajallah el-Helou&lt;/a&gt; and Nicolas Shawi. He was succeeded by Farouk Dahrouj.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Lebanese Civil War&lt;/a&gt; Hawi, who used the &lt;a href=\"kunya%20%28Arabic%29\"&gt;kunya&lt;/a&gt;-style &lt;a href=\"nom%20de%20guerre\"&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Abu%20%28father%29\"&gt;Abu&lt;/a&gt; Anis\", established the Popular Guard, the LCP militia, which was aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20National%20Movement\"&gt;Lebanese National Movement&lt;/a&gt; (LNM) of &lt;a href=\"Druze\"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Kamal%20Jumblatt\"&gt;Kamal Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; in its opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Maronite\"&gt;Maronite&lt;/a&gt;-dominated government and &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;-backed &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe LCP was also active in the &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and its proxy militia, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Lebanon%20Army\"&gt;South Lebanon Army&lt;/a&gt; (SLA), in southern Lebanon, after the &lt;a href=\"1982%20Lebanon%20War\"&gt;Israeli invasion&lt;/a&gt; in 1982. During the invasion he created the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20National%20Resistance%20Front\"&gt;Lebanese National Resistance Front&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=\"Muhsin%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Muhsin Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;. LNRF was commanded by &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Atallah\"&gt;Elias Atallah&lt;/a&gt;. At later stages of the war, the LCP under Hawi allied with &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, which had entered Lebanon in 1976, but was to stay in the country for nearly 30 years.\nHe became a critic of the influence of &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; late in his life, after having left the LCP in 2000. In 2004, he supported the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Left-wing%20politics\"&gt;leftist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Democratic%20Left%20Movement\"&gt;Democratic Left Movement&lt;/a&gt; (DLM), that was against the Syrian presence in Lebanon and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Revolution\"&gt;Independence Uprising&lt;/a&gt; of 2005. Murdered &lt;a href=\"journalist\"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Samir%20Kassir\"&gt;Samir Kassir&lt;/a&gt; was a prominent member and co-founder of this group.\nIn June 2005, Hawi claimed in an interview with &lt;a href=\"Al%20Jazeera\"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Rifaat%20al-Assad\"&gt;Rifaat al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Hafez%20al%20Assad\"&gt;Hafez al Assad&lt;/a&gt; and uncle of Syria's current &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Syria\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bashar%20al-Assad\"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt.\nAssassination.\nGeorge Hawi was assassinated on 21 June 2005 when a bomb planted in his Mercedes car was detonated by remote control, as he travelled through &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;'s Wata Musaitbi neighbourhood. A nearly one-pound charge was placed under his seat, and was detonated by remote control. His driver survived, but Hawi was mortally wounded in the blast. Several sources including the &lt;a href=\"March%2014%20Alliance\"&gt;March 14 Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and members of the Western media immediately blamed Syria for his killing and for the other explosions in the capital though a definitive culprit has yet to be found.\nIn August 2011, the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Tribunal%20for%20Lebanon\"&gt;Special Tribunal for Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; informed members of Hawi's family that they had found a link between his murder and that of former Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Rafic%20Hariri\"&gt;Rafic Hariri&lt;/a&gt;. The STL had previously issued indictments against members of &lt;a href=\"Hezbollah\"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; for the Hariri killing."
