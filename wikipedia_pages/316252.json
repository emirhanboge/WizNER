    "text": "The Swedish Army () is the &lt;a href=\"army\"&gt;land force&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Swedish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Svea%20Life%20Guards\"&gt;Svea Life Guards&lt;/a&gt; dates back to the year 1521, when the men of &lt;a href=\"Dalarna\"&gt;Dalarna&lt;/a&gt; chose 16 young able men as &lt;a href=\"Royal%20guard\"&gt;body guard&lt;/a&gt;s for the insurgent nobleman &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Vasa\"&gt;Gustav Vasa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20War%20of%20Liberation\"&gt;Swedish War of Liberation&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Danish-dominated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Kalmar\"&gt;Union of Kalmar&lt;/a&gt;, thus making the present-day &lt;a href=\"Life%20Guards%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Life Guards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20oldest%20military%20units%20and%20formations%20in%20continuous%20operation\"&gt;one of the world's oldest regiments still on active duty.&lt;/a&gt;\nIn 1901, Sweden introduced &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;. The conscription system was abolished in 2010, but reinstated in 2017.\nOrganisation.\nThe peace-time organisation of the Swedish Army is divided into a number of regiments for the different branches. The number of active regiments has been reduced since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. However the Swedish Army has begun to expand once again. The regiment forms training organizations that train the various battalions of the army and home guard.\nThe Swedish Armed Forces recently underwent a transformation from &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;-based recruitment to a professional defence organisation. This is part of a larger goal to abandon the mass army from the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; and develop an army better suited to modern &lt;a href=\"maneuver%20warfare\"&gt;maneuver warfare&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time retain a higher readiness. Since 2014, the Swedish army has had around 50,000 soldiers in either full-time or part-time duty, with eight &lt;a href=\"mechanized%20infantry\"&gt;mechanized infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s instantly available at any time and the full force of 71 battalions ready to be deployed within one week. The regular army consists of 8 mechanised maneuver battalions, 19 support battalions of different kinds including &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; battalions, &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft\"&gt;anti-aircraft&lt;/a&gt; battalions, &lt;a href=\"combat%20engineer\"&gt;combat engineer&lt;/a&gt; battalions, &lt;a href=\"Light%20infantry%23Contemporary%20light%20infantry%20forces\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, logistics battalions and 4 reserve heavy armoured battalions and 40 territorial defence battalions. The battalion is the core unit but all units are completely modular and can be arranged in combat teams from &lt;a href=\"company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt; level with different units depending on the task. There are a total of 6 permanent staffs under the central command capable of handling large battlegroups, 4 regional staffs and 2 brigade staffs.\nLeadership.\nUntil 1937 the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; was the formal Head of the Army, and &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Government%20%281809%29\"&gt;until 1974&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; at large. In 1937, the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Chief of the Army&lt;/a&gt; position and headquarters staff (, \"CA\") was created to lead the Army in peacetime. Following a larger reorganisation of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1994, CA ceased to exist as an independent agency, and all of the Armed Forces was centralized under the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Commander%20of%20the%20Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00d6B\"). Instead, the post Chief of Army Staff () was created at the then newly instituted &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Armed%20Forces%20Headquarters\"&gt;Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; (\"HKV\").\nIn 1998, the Swedish Armed Forces was yet again reorganized. Most of the duties of the Chief of Army Staff were transferred to the newly instituted post of \"&lt;a href=\"Inspector%20General\"&gt;Inspector General&lt;/a&gt; of the Army\" (). The post is similar to that of the \"Inspector General of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Navy\"&gt;Swedish Navy&lt;/a&gt;\" () and the \"Inspector General of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Swedish Air Force&lt;/a&gt;\" (), later renamed to \"Inspector of the Army\" (). In 2014, the Chief of Army (, \"AC\") position was reinstated.\nActive regiments.\nSwedish Army regiments are tasked with training conscripts for the operational battalions of the army's rapid reaction organisation. The Gotland Regiment is the only regiment, which also trains Home Guard troops. The currently active regiments and their main peacetime subordinate units are:\nOperational units.\nThe Army formed a Rapid Reaction Organisation (Insatsorganisation in Swedish) in 2014. Under the organisation the training regiments of the army would be able to form two combat brigades and a number of independent combat battalions within a few days. This plan, however, was considered by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Commander%20of%20the%20Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/a&gt; to be impossible due to the economic situation at the time.\nIn 2013, the Armed Forces issued a statement saying that the reorganisation would only suffice for a reasonable defence of Swedish territory for one week. The force was to include the following units:\nAs of 2021 the Army's units of the Rapid Reaction Organisation are:\nThe following Armed Forces' establishments provide additional units for the Rapid Reaction Organisation:\nIf activated the two brigades of the Rapid Reaction Force would be formed with the following units:\nHome Guard.\nThe Home Guard (&lt;a href=\"Home%20Guard%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Hemv\u00e4rnet&lt;/a&gt;) consists of 40 battalions with a total of 22,000 men. Many of the soldiers have served abroad with regular army units.\nNorthern Military Region.\nThe Northern Military Region is responsible for supporting Home Guard units in, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4mtland%20County\"&gt;J\u00e4mtland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norrbotten%20County\"&gt;Norrbotten County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sterbotten%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4sterbotten County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sternorrland%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4sternorrland County&lt;/a&gt; with training and administrative resources.\nCentral Military Region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Central%20Military%20Region%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Central Military Region&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for supporting Home Guard units in &lt;a href=\"Dalarna%20County\"&gt;Dalarna County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A4vleborg%20County\"&gt;G\u00e4vleborg County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6dermanland%20County\"&gt;S\u00f6dermanland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20County\"&gt;Stockholm County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uppsala%20County\"&gt;Uppsala County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4stmanland%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4stmanland County&lt;/a&gt; with training and administrative resources.\nSouthern Military Region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Military%20Region%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Southern Military Region&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for supporting Home Guard units in &lt;a href=\"Blekinge%20County\"&gt;Blekinge County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping%20County\"&gt;J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20County\"&gt;Kalmar County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kronoberg%20County\"&gt;Kronoberg County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A5ne%20County\"&gt;Sk\u00e5ne County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%C3%96sterg%C3%B6tland%20County\"&gt;\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County&lt;/a&gt; with training and administrative resources.\nWestern Military Region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Western%20Military%20Region%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Western Military Region&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for supporting Home Guard units in &lt;a href=\"Halland%20County\"&gt;Halland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4rmland%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4rmland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4stra%20G%C3%B6taland%20County\"&gt;V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%C3%96rebro%20County\"&gt;\u00d6rebro County&lt;/a&gt; with training and administrative resources.\nGotland Military Region.\nThe Home Guard battalion on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gotland\"&gt;Gotland&lt;/a&gt; falls under the &lt;a href=\"Gotland%20Regiment\"&gt;Gotland Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, which also commands the active 181st Armored Battalion.\nSize.\nThe army on active service during most of the 20th century only consisted of conscript receiving their basic training (at the most one year for privates), and conscripts called up for refreshers (at the most one month for privates) with intervals of at least 4\u20136 years. During WWII smaller or larger parts of the wartime establishment were also called up for periodical stand-by duty (up to 6 months). The figures for total strength below refer to the total force which could be mobilised.\nBetween the introduction of universal conscription in 1902 until the start of World War II, the army was usually maintained at a consistent strength of 100,000 men, with two-thirds of the force being conscripts for two years. From 1942 onwards, the Swedish government embarked upon a massive and ambitious militarisation program in which conscription was strictly enforced and compulsory service was extended. The basic training for privates was set at 12 months, for future conscript sergeants intended to become platoon leaders (mainly sixth form graduates) 18 months, and for future conscript officers 24 months. These periods were gradually reduced, and the ranks were raised, until it was the same period for all conscripts shortly before national service was suspended in 2009. This combined with propaganda about conscription being a part of social duty and defending the Swedish principle of Folkhemmet, led to an army a size of about 700,000 active duty soldiers that could be mobilised in late 1945. Since the late winter of 1945 the size of the army was slowly decreased as entire reserve battalions and brigades were gradually demobilised, and by late 1947 the size of the army was around 170,000 soldiers who could be mobilised and was planned to stabilise at such a quantity of personnel.\nHowever, due to the rise in tensions between the East and West over the political landscape of Europe, the threat from the Soviet Union in 1949 and 1950, coinciding with the start of the Cold War, led to a return to the militaristic policy by the Swedish government. From 1950 until around 1976 the size of the army was at an average of 250,000 soldiers with a peak of 400,000 mobilisable soldiers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The rules were badly enforced, but dodging the draft was punishable with imprisonment.\nDuring the 1980s the size of the army was around 180,000 soldiers and was slowly increased as time progressed until around 1988. The end of the Cold War led to a massive restructuring of the Swedish Army. Every year after 1988, the Army discharged around 40,000 conscripts and recruited only 20,000, so that by 1995 the size was down to 80,000 soldiers. Around this time the compulsory service obligation was further reduced to 10 months, reserve service became more flexible, and changes made in enforcement so that forceful enforcement became withdrawn as policy. By 2004 the size of the Swedish Army was down to 60,000 soldiers, and in 2013, three years after the end of conscription, the size was at an all-time low of just 16,000 soldiers, though the army plans to reach a level of 50,000 professional soldiers by 2020, mostly through a large media campaigns. A number of previously disbanded regiments will also be re-raised (&lt;a href=\"Dalarna%20Regiment\"&gt;Dalarna Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sternorrland%20Regiment\"&gt;V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norrland%20Dragoon%20Regiment\"&gt;Norrland Dragoon Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bergslagen%20Artillery%20Regiment\"&gt;Bergslagen Artillery Regiment&lt;/a&gt;) with the &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4mtland%20Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;J\u00e4mtland Ranger Regiment&lt;/a&gt; re-raised as a battalion of V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment.\nRecruitment.\nFrom the 17th century until 1901, Swedish Army recruitment was based upon the &lt;a href=\"allotment%20system\"&gt;allotment system&lt;/a&gt;. In 1812, conscription was introduced for all males between age 20 and 25 to serve in the armed forces twelve days a year, increased in 1858 to four weeks per two years. The allotment system was abolished in 1901 and replaced with universal conscription for all males. All personnel were drafted as conscripts for a year of national service, after which the unit the soldier trained with was put in reserve. Upon completion of conscript service with sufficient service marks, conscripts are eligible to apply for commissioned officer training, &lt;a href=\"Non-commissioned%20officer\"&gt;NCO/Warrant Officer&lt;/a&gt; or from 2007 stay in the Army as a professional &lt;a href=\"Private%20%28rank%29\"&gt;private&lt;/a&gt;, mainly to be employed in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Battle%20Group\"&gt;Nordic Battle Group&lt;/a&gt;. The army has employed soldiers for &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20peacekeeping\"&gt;UN service&lt;/a&gt; on short time contracts since the 1950s for service abroad.\nFrom July 2010 until March 2017, the Swedish Army was an all-professional fighting force. On the 3 March the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt; reinstated national service. In 2017, around 13,000 men and women are to sign up for the draft, and of them 4,000 will be selected for national service starting January 2018. The government stated that the number of conscripts may increase in response to foreign events.\nRanks.\nThe rank insignia of &lt;a href=\"commissioned%20officer\"&gt;commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe rank insignia of &lt;a href=\"non-commissioned%20officer\"&gt;non-commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Enlisted%20rank\"&gt;enlisted personnel&lt;/a&gt;."
