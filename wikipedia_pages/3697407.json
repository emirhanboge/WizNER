    "text": "Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau (28 August 1721 \u2013 9 January 1820) was a French architect, draughtsman, &lt;a href=\"antiquary\"&gt;antiquary&lt;/a&gt;, and artist who became a leading authority on ancient Roman architecture and Roman ruins in Italy and France. With his influence extending to Russia, England, and the United States, and clients including &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine the Great&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, Cl\u00e9risseau played a key role in the genesis of &lt;a href=\"neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;neoclassical architecture&lt;/a&gt; during the second half of the 18th century.\nEducation; career in Rome.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Cl\u00e9risseau was a pupil of the architect &lt;a href=\"Germain%20Boffrand\"&gt;Germain Boffrand&lt;/a&gt;. In 1746, in his mid-twenties, he won a Premier &lt;a href=\"Prix%20de%20Rome\"&gt;Prix de Rome&lt;/a&gt; in the architectural competition to design \"Un grand h\u00f4tel\", or great mansion.\nThe prize included a scholarship to study in Rome, and in 1749 Cl\u00e9risseau became an official \"pensionnaire\" (resident) at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20in%20Rome\"&gt;French Academy in Rome&lt;/a&gt;, where his instructors included the painter of ruins &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Paolo%20Pannini\"&gt;Giovanni Paolo Pannini&lt;/a&gt;. In Rome he also befriended &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Battista%20Piranesi\"&gt;Giovanni Battista Piranesi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claude-Joseph%20Vernet\"&gt;Claude-Joseph Vernet&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1752 the three of them set out on a sketching tour of &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Villa\"&gt;Hadrian's Villa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tivoli%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Tivoli&lt;/a&gt;. Before beginning to draw, the three first had to cut and burn away the undergrowth, where lurked colonies of venomous snakes and scorpions.\nIn 1753, Cl\u00e9risseau's final months at the Academy were marred by a bitter dispute with its director, &lt;a href=\"Charles-Joseph%20Natoire\"&gt;Charles-Joseph Natoire&lt;/a&gt;. Cl\u00e9risseau was for a time expelled, but was eventually allowed to return and complete his scholarship.\nIn 1755 the Scottish architect &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Adam\"&gt;Robert Adam&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, where he met Cl\u00e9risseau, who accompanied him to Rome; there the ambitious Adam resolved, under thea of Cl\u00e9risseau, to produce a volume for publication upon his return to Britain that would establish him as a serious architect. The project finally selected was a volume documenting the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Diocletian%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Diocletian's Palace&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Split%20%28city%29\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt;, on the Dalmatian coast. Over a period of five weeks in 1757 Adam sketched and supervised the documentation of the ruins, while Cl\u00e9risseau produced perspectives, and two German draftsmen undertook the measured drawings. Most of the published engravings in Adam's \"Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro\" (1764) are believed to be the work of Cl\u00e9risseau, though he received no credit.\nCl\u00e9risseau passed most of the next decades in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. As it had done since the &lt;a href=\"High%20Renaissance\"&gt;High Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Rome and modern Rome functioned as a cultural hub, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Antiquity\"&gt;Classical Antiquity&lt;/a&gt; providing a school in themselves, if one had a knowledgeable guide. Cl\u00e9risseau served as a mentor to a generation of young architectural students who (like Cl\u00e9risseau) had won the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Prix%20de%20Rome\"&gt;Prix de Rome&lt;/a&gt; and came to study at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20in%20Rome\"&gt;French Academy in Rome&lt;/a&gt;. He also guided the developing taste for the Antique in young French and British artists and gentlemen amateurs on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Tour\"&gt;Grand Tour&lt;/a&gt;. His skillful drawings of ancient architectural details, of real Roman ruins and imaginary ones, helped form the taste of young architects like &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Adam\"&gt;Robert Adam&lt;/a&gt; in the 1750s and his brother &lt;a href=\"James%20Adam%20%28architect%29\"&gt;James Adam&lt;/a&gt;, in 1760-63. Cl\u00e9risseau added to his income by providing architectural illustrations, sometimes in series, for young men on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Tour\"&gt;Grand Tour&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the first of December, 1763, in &lt;a href=\"San%20Luigi%20dei%20Francesi\"&gt;San Luigi dei Francesi&lt;/a&gt; (Church of St. Louis of the French) in Rome, Cl\u00e9risseau married Ther\u00e8se, daughter of the sculptor &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20de%20l%27Estache\"&gt;Pierre de l'Estache&lt;/a&gt;. \"Cl\u00e9risseau was forty-two and Ther\u00e9se was presumably much younger, though her father was about seventy-five at the time.\"\nReturn to Paris; dealings with Catherine the Great and Thomas Jefferson.\nUpon his return to Paris in the summer of 1767, Cl\u00e9risseau became a magnet for young neoclassical architects, like &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph%20B%C3%A9langer\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9langer&lt;/a&gt;, who themselves never visited Rome.\nAlthough they never met, and he never traveled to Russia, Cl\u00e9risseau nonetheless attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine the Great&lt;/a&gt;, who in 1773 solicited from him plans for a house in a style \"\u00e0 l'antique\" to be erected in her gardens at &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo&lt;/a&gt;. Catherine was vexed when she received the plans, which were far more elaborate than she expected, \"a grandiose Roman palace\" described \"as the &lt;a href=\"Baths%20of%20Caracalla\"&gt;Baths of Caracalla&lt;/a&gt; set into &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Villa\"&gt;Hadrian's Villa&lt;/a&gt;.\" There is no evidence that Cl\u00e9risseau was ever paid for the rejected plans. Nevertheless, in 1778 Catherine again approached him, through an emissary, and arranged to purchase over a thousand drawings and artworks from him; this huge cache would ultimately find a home in the &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Museum\"&gt;Hermitage&lt;/a&gt;. In 1780 she asked Cl\u00e9risseau to design a triumphal arch to be built in Russia, but when the plans arrived she decided the gigantic project would be too large and expensive and abandoned it. \nAlthough his projects for Catherine never came to fruition, Cl\u00e9risseau's drawings and designs were highly influential in the decoration of her apartments at &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo&lt;/a&gt;. In recognition of his artistic achievements and his efforts on her behalf, the empress made Cl\u00e9risseau an honorary member of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Academy%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Imperial Academy of Arts&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed on him the title \"Premier Architecte de Sa Majest\u00e9e Imp\u00e9riale\".\nFor the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B4tel%20Grimod%20de%20La%20Reyni%C3%A8re\"&gt;H\u00f4tel Grimod de La Reyni\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, built in Paris in 1775, Cl\u00e9risseau and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89tienne%20de%20La%20Vall%C3%A9e%20Poussin\"&gt;\u00c9tienne de La Vall\u00e9e Poussin&lt;/a&gt; executed the first decorative scheme in Europe to be inspired by the recent archaeological discoveries at &lt;a href=\"Pompeii\"&gt;Pompeii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herculanum\"&gt;Herculanum&lt;/a&gt;. A set of eight painted \"&lt;a href=\"boiserie\"&gt;boiserie&lt;/a&gt;s\" depicting sixteen scenes from the life of Achilles were sold in 1850 and are now in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum\"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London.\nIn 1785, Cl\u00e9risseau was retained by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; to produce designs for the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20State%20Capitol\"&gt;Virginia State Capitol&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"Maison%20Carr%C3%A9e\"&gt;Maison Carr\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Roman temple in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%AEmes\"&gt;N\u00eemes&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Jefferson was residing in Paris, serving as American Minister to France. Jefferson wrote that \"it was a considerable time before I could find an architect whose taste had been formed on a study of ancient models of this art; the style of architecture in this capital [Paris] being far from chaste.\" Cl\u00e9risseau, he noted, \"has studied 20 years in Rome, and has given proofs of his skill and taste by a publication of some antiquities of this country.\" Jefferson was referring to the first (and only) volume in Cl\u00e9risseau's intended series \"Antiquit\u00e9s de la France,\" published in Paris in 1788 with the subtitle \"Monumens de Nismes\". The folio included detailed engravings of the &lt;a href=\"Maison%20Carr%C3%A9e\"&gt;Maison Carr\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, which Jefferson praised as \"one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful and precious morsel of architecture left us by antiquity.\"\n\"Cl\u00e9risseau's role in designing the Capitol has been much debated. Fiske Kimball argues persuasively that the building is essentially Jefferson's and that Cl\u00e9risseau was merely a consultant.\"\nCl\u00e9risseau in museums and exhibitions.\nCl\u00e9risseau created works on paper using a variety of media, often in combination, including pencil, chalk, ink, watercolor, and gouache. Many of his works were reproduced as etchings by engravers including &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Cunego\"&gt;Domenico Cunego&lt;/a&gt; (the series \"Views of Antique Buildings and Famous Ruins in Italy\"), &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Bartolozzi\"&gt;Francesco Bartolozzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Zucchi\"&gt;Francesco Zucchi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Santini\"&gt;Paolo Santini&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his lifetime, Cl\u00e9risseau exhibited works at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Salon\"&gt;Paris Salon&lt;/a&gt; in 1773, 1775, 1883, and 1808. \nThe largest cache of Cl\u00e9risseau's work is in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Museum\"&gt;Hermitage&lt;/a&gt; in St. Petersburg. An exhibition of these works was presented in 1995 at the Louvre in Paris, and in 1996 at the Hermitage; an illustrated catalogue with notes and essays was published in 1995 in Paris by Editions de la R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux. \nLarge groups of works by of Cl\u00e9risseau are also conserved at &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Soane%27s%20Museum\"&gt;Sir John Soane's Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London (four drawings and twenty-two works in gouache can be seen at the museum's web site) and at the &lt;a href=\"Fitzwilliam%20Museum\"&gt;Fitzwilliam Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks by Cl\u00e9risseau are also in the collections of the &lt;a href=\"Louvre\"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9e%20Cantini\"&gt;Mus\u00e9e Cantini&lt;/a&gt; in Marseille, the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum\"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Collection\"&gt;Royal Collection Trust&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Whitworth%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;Whitworth Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Manchester\"&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Albertina\"&gt;Albertina&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna, the &lt;a href=\"Rijksmuseum\"&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston\"&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Boston&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fleming%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Fleming Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Vermont\"&gt;University of Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blanton%20Museum\"&gt;Blanton Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, the &lt;a href=\"Huntington%20Library\"&gt;Huntington Library&lt;/a&gt; in San Marino, California, and the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Honor%20%28museum%29\"&gt;Legion of Honor&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.\nCl\u00e9risseau at auction.\nIn 2019, a work by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"Roman ruins with oriental staffage,\" was auctioned at Sotheby's for $32,500.\nIn 2018, a work by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"View of the interior of an antique Roman bath,\" signed, was auctioned at Sotheby's for \u00a311,875.\nIn 2016, a work by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"A classical capriccio with figures by a great arch,\" signed and dated 1786, was auctioned at Christie's for \u00a313,750\nIn 2015, a lot of two works by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"The Arch of Titus, Rome; and The Forum of Nerva, Rome,\" both signed, was auctioned at Christie's for \u00a320,000.\nIn 2014, a lot of two works by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"Ancient gate at Cumae near Naples; Grotto of Egeria on the Via Appia,\" both signed and dated 1769, was auctioned at Sotheby's for $20,000.\nIn 2013, a work by Cl\u00e9risseau described as \"Capriccio of roman ruins, with figures in the foreground,\" signed, was auctioned at Sotheby's for \u00a320,000.
