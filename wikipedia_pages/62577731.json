    "text": "Colette Magny (31 October 1926 \u2013 12 June 1997) was a French singer and songwriter. A charismatic performer who did not record until her thirties, her work encompassed &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protest%20song\"&gt;protest song&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spoken%20word\"&gt;spoken word&lt;/a&gt; recordings.\nLife and career.\nShe was born in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and from 1948 worked as a secretary and &lt;a href=\"translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development\"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD). Fluent in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, she became a fan of American &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; singers such as &lt;a href=\"Bessie%20Smith\"&gt;Bessie Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ella%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Ella Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, and was taught &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt; by jazz musician &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Luter\"&gt;Claude Luter&lt;/a&gt;. She also started writing songs. Her mother took up acting in the 1950s, and Colette began singing her own songs and &lt;a href=\"blues%20standard\"&gt;blues standard&lt;/a&gt;s in Paris clubs. She made her first recordings in 1958, on an album by &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt;er and bandleader &lt;a href=\"Gilles%20Thibaut\"&gt;Gilles Thibaut&lt;/a&gt;, \"Des classiques du jazz\".\nAfter appearing at the Contrescarpe &lt;a href=\"cabaret\"&gt;cabaret&lt;/a&gt; in 1962, she was discovered by the singer &lt;a href=\"Mireille%20Hartuch\"&gt;Mireille Hartuch&lt;/a&gt;, who featured her on her TV show \"Le Petit Conservatoire de la Chanson\". She received rave reviews, and gave up her full-time job for a musical career. She signed with &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Records%20International\"&gt;CBS Records&lt;/a&gt;, and her first single, the self-penned \"Melocoton\" (\"Peach\"), which featured &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Baker\"&gt;Mickey Baker&lt;/a&gt; on guitar as did many of her later recordings, became a hit in France in 1963. Her first album, self-titled but sometimes known as \"Les Tuileries\", also featured her musical treatments of poems by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rimbaud\"&gt;Rimbaud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rilke\"&gt;Rilke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Aragon\"&gt;Louis Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as blues classics including \"&lt;a href=\"St.%20James%20Infirmary%20Blues\"&gt;Saint James Infirmary&lt;/a&gt;\" and Bessie Smith's \"Any Woman's Blues\". Her second album, the experimental \"\"Avec\" po\u00e8me\" (1966), released on the record label established by &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Mouloudji\"&gt;Marcel Mouloudji&lt;/a&gt;, contained both spoken and sung texts over &lt;a href=\"electroacoustic%20music\"&gt;electroacoustic music&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"musique%20concr%C3%A8te\"&gt;musique concr\u00e8te&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"Surrealist\"&gt;Surrealist&lt;/a&gt;-influenced composer &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Almur%C3%B3\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Almur\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagny became increasingly supportive of political activism. Her song \"Le mal du vivre\" was banned by &lt;a href=\"ORTF\"&gt;ORTF&lt;/a&gt;, the state broadcasting network, and marked her out as France's first &lt;a href=\"protest%20singer\"&gt;protest singer&lt;/a&gt;. Her recordings were issued by &lt;a href=\"Le%20Chant%20du%20Monde\"&gt;Le Chant du Monde&lt;/a&gt;. Her next album, also self-titled, featured her songs \"Vietnam 67\" and \"Viva Cuba\", together with one celebrating a strike of port workers, as well as further settings of poems and &lt;a href=\"metaphysical\"&gt;metaphysical&lt;/a&gt; texts. During the events and riots of &lt;a href=\"May%2068\"&gt;May 68&lt;/a&gt;, she actively supported students and workers at &lt;a href=\"sit-in\"&gt;sit-in&lt;/a&gt;s and through &lt;a href=\"benefit%20concert\"&gt;benefit concert&lt;/a&gt;s. She wrote the song \"Les militants\" for the protesters, and later also issued a &lt;a href=\"spoken%20word\"&gt;spoken word&lt;/a&gt; album, \"Magny 68/69\".\nShe produced three albums in the early 1970s \u2013 \"Feu et rythme\" (1970), which won the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20du%20Disque\"&gt;Grand Prix du Disque&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Acad%C3%A9mie%20Charles%20Cros\"&gt;Acad\u00e9mie Charles Cros&lt;/a&gt;; \"R\u00e9pression\" (1972), which concerned &lt;a href=\"censorship\"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; and was supportive of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther%20Party\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt; movement; and \"Transit\" (1975), which she recorded with &lt;a href=\"free%20jazz\"&gt;free jazz&lt;/a&gt; performers including saxophonist &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Merle\"&gt;Maurice Merle&lt;/a&gt;. Her 1977 album \"Visage-Village\" was recorded with the &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock group&lt;/a&gt; Dharma and &lt;a href=\"accordion\"&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;ist Lino Leonardi. According to writer Beno\u00eet Houz\u00e9, \"throughout her experiments, Magny always kept an artistic generosity which clearly binds most of her songs, as 'avant-gardist' as they can be, to the tradition of French \"&lt;a href=\"Chanson%23Modern%20chanson\"&gt;chanson populaire&lt;/a&gt;\".\"\nHer 1979 album \"Je Veux Chaanter\" was recorded with, and included songs written by, children with mental disabilities in the Institut m\u00e9dico-p\u00e9dagogique at &lt;a href=\"Fontenoy-le-Ch%C3%A2teau\"&gt;Fontenoy-le-Ch\u00e2teau&lt;/a&gt;, and was performed partly with home-made instruments. In 1980, she released two single-sided spoken word albums, one of poems by &lt;a href=\"Antonin%20Artaud\"&gt;Antonin Artaud&lt;/a&gt; and the other of text by the Swiss artist &lt;a href=\"Sylvie%20Duval\"&gt;Sylvie Duval&lt;/a&gt;. Magny moved to live near &lt;a href=\"Aveyron\"&gt;Aveyron&lt;/a&gt; in south-west France, and her recordings became more mellow in tone, her 1983 album \"Chansons pour Titine\" even including &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Porter\"&gt;Cole Porter&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Heart%20Belongs%20to%20Daddy\"&gt;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&lt;/a&gt;\". Her final album, \"Kevork\" (1989), included a song in praise of the &lt;a href=\"turkey%20%28bird%29\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, a bird which, once released from domestication, can revert to its wild state.\nMagny suffered from health problems including &lt;a href=\"obesity\"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and, in later years, a spinal disease that confined her to a bed or wheelchair. She died in 1997, aged 70.\nBiography.\nA biography by Sylvie Vadureau, \"Colette Magny, Citoyenne - Blues\", was published in 2017."
