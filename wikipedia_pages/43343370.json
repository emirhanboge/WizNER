    "text": "Ferenc Haller, \"count Haller von Hallerke\u00f6\" (24 March 1796 \u2013 5 March 1875) was a Hungarian politician. He served as &lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28title%29\"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Croatia-Slavonia\"&gt;Croatia-Slavonia&lt;/a&gt; between 1842 and 1845 during the Croatian national revival and the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20movement\"&gt;Illyrian movement&lt;/a&gt; in the 1830s and 1840s.\nHaller was born in &lt;a href=\"Kerel%C5%91szentp%C3%A1l\"&gt;Kerel\u0151szentp\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the Hungarian-Transylvanian branch of the &lt;a href=\"Haller%20von%20Hallerstein\"&gt;Haller von Hallerstein&lt;/a&gt; family. He was promoted by emperor &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Joseph\"&gt;Franz Joseph&lt;/a&gt; as ban on 16 June 1842 and was later promoted to lieutenant general. He took office on 18 October. Haller was brought in to carry on &lt;a href=\"Magyarization\"&gt;Magyarization&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1843, the use of the Illyrian name was banned. In large part due to the &lt;a href=\"July%20victims\"&gt;July victims&lt;/a&gt; incident, in which thirteen protesters were killed in &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;, Haller resigned his post and continued his military career in the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Bishop &lt;a href=\"Juraj%20Haulik\"&gt;Juraj Haulik&lt;/a&gt; became ban soon after.\nIn 1845 Haller donated 500 &lt;a href=\"forint\"&gt;forint&lt;/a&gt; for building the &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20National%20Theatre%20in%20Zagreb\"&gt;Croatian National Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zagreb\"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;."
