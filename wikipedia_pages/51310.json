    "text": "Citro\u00ebn () is a French brand of automobiles owned by &lt;a href=\"Stellantis\"&gt;Stellantis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1934, the firm established its reputation for innovative technology with the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Traction%20Avant\"&gt;Traction Avant&lt;/a&gt;. This was the world's first car to be mass-produced with &lt;a href=\"front-wheel%20drive\"&gt;front-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt;, four-wheel independent suspension, as well as &lt;a href=\"unibody\"&gt;unibody&lt;/a&gt; construction, omitting a separate chassis, and instead using the body of the car itself as its main load-bearing structure.\nIn 1954 they produced the world's first &lt;a href=\"hydropneumatic\"&gt;hydropneumatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"self-levelling%20suspension\"&gt;self-levelling suspension&lt;/a&gt; system then, in 1955, the revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;, the first mass-produced car with modern &lt;a href=\"disc%20brakes\"&gt;disc brakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ref name=\"vintagecars.about.com/internet archive\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1967, they introduced in several of their models &lt;a href=\"Headlamp%23Beam%20aim%20control\"&gt;swiveling headlights&lt;/a&gt; that allowed for greater visibility on winding roads; these cars have received various national and international awards, including three &lt;a href=\"European%20Car%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;European Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\n&lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; built &lt;a href=\"armament\"&gt;armament&lt;/a&gt;s for France during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;; after the war however, he realised that, unless he planned ahead he would have a modern factory without a product. Citro\u00ebn was already experienced in the automotive business, thanks to a successful six-year stint working with &lt;a href=\"Mors%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Mors&lt;/a&gt; between 1908 and the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. The decision to switch to automobile manufacturing was taken as early as 1916, which is the year when Citro\u00ebn asked the engineer Louis Dufresne, previously with &lt;a href=\"Panhard\"&gt;Panhard&lt;/a&gt;, to design a technically-sophisticated 18HP automobile for which he could use his factory once peace returned. Long before that happened, however, he had modified his vision and decided, like &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ford\"&gt;Henry Ford&lt;/a&gt;, that the best post-war opportunities in auto-making would involve a lighter car of good quality, but made in sufficient quantities to be priced enticingly. In February 1917 Citro\u00ebn contacted another engineer, , who already had a considerable reputation within the French automotive sector as the creator, in 1909, of a little car called &lt;a href=\"Le%20Z%C3%A8bre\"&gt;Le Z\u00e8bre&lt;/a&gt;. Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn's mandate was characteristically demanding and characteristically simple: to produce an all-new design for a 10 HP car that would be better equipped, more robust and less costly to produce than any rival product at the time.\nThe result was the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Type%20A\"&gt;Type A&lt;/a&gt;, announced to the press in March 1919, just four months after the guns fell silent. The first production Type A emerged from the factory, located at &lt;a href=\"Quai%20Andr%C3%A9-Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;Quai de Javel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaugirard\"&gt;Vaugirard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of May 1919 and in June it was exhibited at a show room at Number 42, on the &lt;a href=\"Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es\"&gt;Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; which normally sold &lt;a href=\"Alda%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;Alda cars&lt;/a&gt;. Citro\u00ebn persuaded the owner of the Alda business, &lt;a href=\"Fernand%20Charron\"&gt;Fernand Charron&lt;/a&gt;, to lend him the show-room, which is still in use today. This \"C42\" showroom is where the company organises exhibitions and shows its vehicles and concept cars. A few years later, Charron would be persuaded to become a major investor in the Citro\u00ebn business. On 7 July 1919, the first customer took delivery of a new &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Type%20A\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn 10HP Type A&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat same year, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn briefly negotiated with &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; a proposed sale of the Citro\u00ebn company. The deal nearly closed, but General Motors ultimately decided that its management and capital would be too overstretched by the takeover. thus Citro\u00ebn remained independent till 1935.\nBetween 1921 and 1937, Citro\u00ebn produced half-track vehicles for off-road and military uses, using the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A9gresse%20track\"&gt;K\u00e9gresse track&lt;/a&gt; system. In the 1920s, the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; purchased several Citro\u00ebn-K\u00e9gresse vehicles for evaluation followed by a licence to produce them. This resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Ordnance%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29\"&gt;Army Ordnance Department&lt;/a&gt; building a prototype in 1939. In December 1942, it went into production with the &lt;a href=\"M2%20Half%20Track%20Car\"&gt;M2 Half Track Car&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M3%20Half-track\"&gt;M3 Half-track&lt;/a&gt; versions. The U.S. eventually produced more than 41,000 vehicles in over 70 versions between 1940 and 1944. After their 1940 occupation of France, the &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;s captured many of the Citro\u00ebn half-track vehicles and &lt;a href=\"armored\"&gt;armored&lt;/a&gt; them for their own use.\nMr Citro\u00ebn was a keen marketer: he used the &lt;a href=\"Eiffel%20Tower\"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt; as the world's largest advertising sign, as recorded in \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;\". He also sponsored expeditions in Asia (&lt;a href=\"Croisi%C3%A8re%20Jaune\"&gt;Croisi\u00e8re Jaune&lt;/a&gt;), North America (Croisi\u00e8re Blanche) and Africa (Croisi\u00e8re Noire), demonstrating the potential for motor vehicles equipped with the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A9gresse%20track\"&gt;K\u00e9gresse track&lt;/a&gt; system to cross inhospitable regions. These expeditions conveyed &lt;a href=\"scientists\"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"journalists\"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemonstrating extraordinary toughness, a 1923 Citro\u00ebn that had already travelled was the first car to be driven around Australia. The car, a 1923 Citro\u00ebn 5CV Type C Torpedo, was driven by Neville Westwood from &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, on a round trip from August to December 1925. This vehicle is now fully restored and in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Australia\"&gt;National Museum of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1924, Citro\u00ebn began a business relationship with the American engineer &lt;a href=\"Edward%20G.%20Budd\"&gt;Edward G. Budd&lt;/a&gt;. From 1899, Budd had worked to develop stainless steel bodies for railroad cars, for the &lt;a href=\"Pullman%20Company\"&gt;Pullman&lt;/a&gt; in particular. Budd went on to manufacture steel bodies for many automakers, &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; being his first big auto client. At the Paris Motor Show in October 1924, Citro\u00ebn introduced the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Type%20B10\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn B10&lt;/a&gt;, the first all-steel body in Europe. These automobiles were initially successful in the marketplace, but soon competitors ( who were still using a &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;en structure for their vehicles ) introduced new body designs. Citro\u00ebn, who did not redesign the bodies of his cars, still sold in large quantities nonetheless, the cars' low price being the main selling point, which factor however caused Citro\u00ebn to experience heavy losses.\nIn 1927 the bank &lt;a href=\"Lazard\"&gt;Lazard&lt;/a&gt; helped Citro\u00ebn by bringing new much-needed funds, as well as by renegotiating its debt - for example, by buying out the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Vente des Automobiles Citro\u00ebn (SOVAC) - It went even further by entering in its capital and being represented on the board; the three directors sent by Lazard were Raymond Philippe, &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Meyer\"&gt;Andre Meyer&lt;/a&gt; and Paul Frantzen. Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn perceived the need to differentiate his product, to avoid the low price competition surrounding his conventional rear drive models in the late 1920s/early 1930s. In 1933 he introduced the Rosalie, the first commercially available passenger car with a &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;, developed with &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Ricardo\"&gt;Harry Ricardo&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraction Avant and Michelin ownership.\nTraction Avant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Traction%20Avant\"&gt;Traction Avant&lt;/a&gt; is a car that pioneered the mass production of three revolutionary features that are still in use today: &lt;a href=\"unibody\"&gt;a unitary body with no separate frame&lt;/a&gt;, four wheel &lt;a href=\"independent%20suspension\"&gt;independent suspension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"front-wheel%20drive\"&gt;front-wheel drive&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas for many decades, the vast majority of motor cars were similar in conception to the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Model%20T\"&gt;Ford Model T&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a body bolted onto a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20frame\"&gt;ladder frame&lt;/a&gt; which held all the mechanical elements of the car, a &lt;a href=\"Suspension%20%28vehicle%29%23Suspension%20geometry\"&gt;solid rear axle&lt;/a&gt; that rigidly connected the rear wheels and &lt;a href=\"rear%20wheel%20drive\"&gt;rear wheel drive&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Model T school\" of automobile engineering proved popular because it was considered cheap to build, although it did pose dynamic defects as automobiles were becoming more capable, and resulted in heavier cars, which is why today cars are more like the Traction Avant than the Model T under the skin.\nIn 1934 Citro\u00ebn commissioned the American &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Company\"&gt;Budd Company&lt;/a&gt; to create a prototype, which evolved into the 7 fiscal horsepower (&lt;a href=\"horsepower%23CV%20and%20cv\"&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;), Traction Avant.\nAchieving quick development of the Traction Avant, tearing down and rebuilding the factory (in five months) and the extensive marketing efforts, were investments that resulted too costly for Citro\u00ebn to do all at once, causing the financial ruin of the company. In December 1934, despite the assistance of the Michelin company, Citro\u00ebn filed for bankruptcy. Within the month, &lt;a href=\"Michelin\"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt;, already the car manufacturer's largest creditor, became its principal shareholder. However, the technologically advanced &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Traction%20Avant\"&gt;Traction Avant&lt;/a&gt; had met with market acceptance, and the basic philosophy of cutting-edge technology used as a differentiator, continued until the late 1990s. &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Michelin%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Pierre Michelin&lt;/a&gt; became the chairman of Citro\u00ebn early in 1935. &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Jules%20Boulanger\"&gt;Pierre-Jules Boulanger&lt;/a&gt;, his deputy, became the vice-president and chief of the engineering and design departments. In 1935, the founder &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; died from stomach cancer.\nResearch breakthroughs.\n&lt;a href=\"Pierre-Jules%20Boulanger\"&gt;Pierre-Jules Boulanger&lt;/a&gt; had been a First World War air reconnaissance photography specialist with the &lt;a href=\"French%20Air%20Force\"&gt;French Air Force&lt;/a&gt;; he was capable and efficient and finished the war with the rank of captain. He was also courageous, having been decorated with the Military Cross and the Legion of Honour. He started working for &lt;a href=\"Michelin\"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt; in 1918, reporting directly to &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Michelin%20%28born%201859%29\"&gt;\u00c9douard Michelin&lt;/a&gt;, co-director and founder of the business. Boulanger joined the Michelin board in 1922 and became president of Citro\u00ebn in January 1938 after the death in a road accident of his friend &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Michelin%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Pierre Michelin&lt;/a&gt; remaining in this position until his own death in 1950. In 1938, he also had become Michelin's joint managing director.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"German%20occupation%20of%20France%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;German occupation of France in World War II&lt;/a&gt; Boulanger refused to meet Dr. &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Porsche\"&gt;Ferdinand Porsche&lt;/a&gt; or communicate with the German authorities except through intermediaries. He organized a \"go slow\" on production of trucks for the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;, many of which were sabotaged at the factory by putting the notch on the oil dipstick in the wrong place, which resulted in engine seizure. In 1944 when the &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in Paris was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Resistance\"&gt;French Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, his name was prominent on a &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; blacklist of the most important enemies of the Reich, to be arrested in the event of an allied invasion of France.\nCitro\u00ebn researchers, including &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Mag%C3%A8s\"&gt;Paul Mag\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, continued their work in secret, against the express orders of the Germans, and developed the concepts that were later brought to market in three remarkable vehicles \u2013 a small car (2CV), a delivery van (Type H) and a large, swift family car (DS). These were widely regarded by contemporary &lt;a href=\"journalists\"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"avant%20garde\"&gt;avant garde&lt;/a&gt;, even radical, solutions to automotive design.\nThus began a decades-long period of unusual &lt;a href=\"brand%20loyalty\"&gt;brand loyalty&lt;/a&gt;, normally seen in the automobile industry only in niche brands, like &lt;a href=\"Porsche\"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ferrari\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2CV.\nCitro\u00ebn unveiled the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%202CV\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn 2CV&lt;/a&gt; or \"Deux Chevaux\" signifying two &lt;a href=\"tax%20horsepower\"&gt;tax horsepower&lt;/a&gt; and initially only , at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Salon\"&gt;Paris Salon&lt;/a&gt; in 1948. The car became a bestseller, achieving the designer's aim of providing rural &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French people&lt;/a&gt; with a motorized alternative to the &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;. It was unusually inexpensive to purchase and, with its small two cylinder engine, inexpensive to run as well. The 2CV pioneered a very soft, interconnected suspension, but did not have the more complex &lt;a href=\"Self-levelling%20suspension\"&gt;self-levelling feature&lt;/a&gt;. This car remained in production, with only minor changes, until 1990 and was a common sight on French roads until recently; 9 million 2CV variants were produced in the period 1948\u20131990.\nThe DS.\n1955 saw the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;, the first full usage of Citro\u00ebn's &lt;a href=\"hydropneumatic\"&gt;hydropneumatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"self-levelling%20suspension\"&gt;self-levelling suspension&lt;/a&gt; system, tested on the rear suspension of the Traction in 1954. The DS was also the first production car with modern &lt;a href=\"disc%20brakes\"&gt;disc brakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nA single high-pressure &lt;a href=\"hydraulic\"&gt;hydraulic&lt;/a&gt; system was used to actuate the &lt;a href=\"power%20steering\"&gt;power steering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"suspension%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;suspension&lt;/a&gt; and brakes; the brakes were fully powered, not power assisted, as pedal force was not a component of braking power.\nThe gearshift, (semi-&lt;a href=\"automatic%20transmission\"&gt;automatic transmission&lt;/a&gt;) was also powered by the hydraulic system through a control valve, with actuating pistons in the &lt;a href=\"gearbox\"&gt;gearbox&lt;/a&gt; cover to shift the gears in the &lt;a href=\"transmission%20%28mechanics%29\"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt;, and the clutch was operated automatically by the system, so there was no clutch pedal. From 1957 the ID19 model offered a simplified hydraulic system, with manual steering and conventional manual gearshift, and a significant price reduction.\nFrom 1968, with revised front end style, the DS also introduced auxiliary driving lights, that moved direction-ally with the steering, improving visibility at night.\nProduction from 1956 to 1975 totalled almost 1.5 million cars.\nThe streamlined car was remarkable for its era and had a remarkable sounding name \u2013 in French, \"DS\" is pronounced , which sounds the same as , which means \"&lt;a href=\"Goddess\"&gt;Goddess&lt;/a&gt;\". It placed third in the 1999 &lt;a href=\"Car%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;Car of the Century&lt;/a&gt; competition.\nHigh pressure hydraulics.\nThis high-pressure hydraulic system would form the basis of over 9 million Citro\u00ebn cars, including the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20SM\"&gt;SM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20GS\"&gt;GS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20CX\"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20BX\"&gt;BX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20XM\"&gt;XM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Xantia\"&gt;Xantia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C5\"&gt;C5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C6\"&gt;C6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Self-levelling%20suspension\"&gt;Self-levelling suspension&lt;/a&gt; is the principal user benefit: the car maintains a constant ride height above the road, regardless of passenger and cargo load and despite the very soft suspension. &lt;a href=\"Hydropneumatic%20suspension\"&gt;Hydropneumatic suspension&lt;/a&gt; is uniquely able to &lt;a href=\"ride%20quality\"&gt;absorb road irregularities&lt;/a&gt; without disturbing the occupants and is often compared to riding on a \"&lt;a href=\"magic%20carpet\"&gt;magic carpet&lt;/a&gt;\" for this reason.\nThese vehicles shared the distinguishing feature of rising to operating &lt;a href=\"ride%20height\"&gt;ride height&lt;/a&gt; when the engine was turned on, like a \"mechanical camel\" (per \"Car &amp; Driver\" magazine). A lever ( later replaced by an electronic switch ) beside the driver's seat allowed the driver to adjust the height of the car; this height adjustability allows for the clearing of obstacles, fording shallow (slow-moving) streams and changing tyres.\nSince Citro\u00ebn was underfunded, its vehicles had the tendency to be underdeveloped at launch, with limited distribution and service networks outside France. \nConsequently, the early DS models experienced teething issues with the complex hydraulic system, eventually, the hydraulic seals and system component design were sorted, becoming reliable.\nLicensing such a technological leap forward was pursued to a limited extent: in 1965 the &lt;a href=\"Rolls-Royce%20Silver%20Shadow\"&gt;Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow&lt;/a&gt; used this type of suspension, while the 1963 &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20600\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz 600&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20300SEL%206.3\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3&lt;/a&gt; tried to replicate its advantages with a costly, complex and expensive to maintain, &lt;a href=\"air%20suspension\"&gt;air suspension&lt;/a&gt;, that avoided the Citro\u00ebn-patented technology. By 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20450SEL%206.9\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9&lt;/a&gt; was finally produced with this proven system and &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; continues to offer variations on this technology today.\nDuring Citro\u00ebn's 1968\u20131975 venture with &lt;a href=\"Maserati\"&gt;Maserati&lt;/a&gt;, the Citro\u00ebn high-pressure hydraulic system was used on several Maserati models : for power clutch operation (Bora); power pedal adjustment (Bora); pop-up headlights (Bora, Merak); brakes (Bora, Merak, Khamsin); steering (Khamsin) and the entire &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Quattroporte\"&gt;Quattroporte II&lt;/a&gt; prototype, which was a four-door &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20SM\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn SM&lt;/a&gt; under the skin.\nAerodynamic pioneer.\nCitro\u00ebn was one of the early pioneers of the now-widespread trend of &lt;a href=\"aerodynamic\"&gt;aerodynamic&lt;/a&gt; automobile design, which helps to reduce &lt;a href=\"fuel%20consumption\"&gt;fuel consumption&lt;/a&gt; and to improve high-speed performance, by reducing &lt;a href=\"Drag%20coefficient\"&gt;wind resistance&lt;/a&gt;. The DS could happily cruise at without any discomfort for the occupants. The firm began using a &lt;a href=\"wind%20tunnel\"&gt;wind tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s, helping them to create highly streamlined cars - such as the DS - that were years ahead of their competitors, and so good were the aerodynamics of the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20CX\"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt; model, that it took its name - formula_1- from the mathematical term used to measure the drag coefficient.\nExpansion and financial challenges.\nIn the 1960s, Citro\u00ebn undertook a series of financial and development decisions, aiming to build on its strength of the 1950s with the successful 2CV, Type H, and DS models. Citro\u00ebn went bankrupt in 1974, so the effectiveness of these maneuvers is rather doubtful.\nThese maneuvers were to address two key gaps facing the company:\nThese steps include:\nThe teams of Charles Marchetti and Citro\u00ebn began working together on the development of the &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom a model range perspective, the 1970s started well, supported by the successful launch of the long-awaited mid-size &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20GS\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn GS&lt;/a&gt;, finally filling the huge gap between the 2CV and the DS \u2013 with a 1-litre, &lt;a href=\"Hydropneumatic%20suspension\"&gt;hydropneumatically suspended&lt;/a&gt; car. The GS went on to sell 2.5 million units; 601,918 cars were produced in 1972 alone - up from the 526,443 of 1971 - enough to lift the company past &lt;a href=\"Peugeot\"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; into second place among French auto makers when ranked by sales volume. The older models continued to sell well - the peak production period of the DS was 1970, and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%202CV\"&gt;2CV&lt;/a&gt; was in 1974.\nAs the 1970s progressed, circumstances became more unfavourable. In 1973, &lt;a href=\"Fiat\"&gt;Fiat&lt;/a&gt; sold back to Michelin its 49% stake in the \"PARDEVI\" holding company that owned Citro\u00ebn, the Citro\u00ebn and Fiat joint announcement indicated that the benefits foreseen for their union in 1968 had failed to materialise. This was not in line with the tyre company's long-term strategy of ending involvements in the car manufacturing business and created a very unstable ownership situation. The company suffered another financial blow with the &lt;a href=\"1973%20energy%20crisis\"&gt;1973 energy crisis&lt;/a&gt; - the gamble on &lt;a href=\"Comotor\"&gt;Comotor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maserati\"&gt;Maserati&lt;/a&gt; showed that there was a serious flaw with the plan particularly for companies producing engines with high fuel consumption.\nIn 1974, the carmaker withdrew from North America due to U.S. design regulations that outlawed core features of Citro\u00ebn cars (see &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20SM\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn SM&lt;/a&gt;).\nHuge losses at Citro\u00ebn were caused by the failure of the &lt;a href=\"Comotor\"&gt;Comotor&lt;/a&gt; rotary engine venture added to the &lt;a href=\"strategic%20management\"&gt;strategic management error&lt;/a&gt; of going the from 1955 to 1970 without a model in the profitable middle range of the European market, plus the massive development costs a string of new models: the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20GS\"&gt;GS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20GS%20Birotor\"&gt;GS Birotor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20CX\"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20SM\"&gt;SM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Bora\"&gt;Maserati Bora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Merak\"&gt;Maserati Merak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Quattroporte%20II\"&gt;Maserati Quattroporte II&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Khamsin\"&gt;Maserati Khamsin&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these models is a technological marvel in its own right.\nThus, forty years after the bankruptcy related to the &lt;a href=\"Traction%20Avant\"&gt;Traction Avant&lt;/a&gt;, Citro\u00ebn went bankrupt again, losing its existence as an independent entity; selling Berliet and Maserati and closing Comotor.\nThe PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn era.\nFearing large job losses due to the poor cash flow situation and the unstable ownership structure, the French government arranged talks between Citro\u00ebn and Michelin culminating in the merger of Automobiles Citro\u00ebn and Automobiles Peugeot into a single company. Thus, one year after the break with Fiat, on 24 June 1974 Citro\u00ebn announced the new partnership, this time with Peugeot. to whom Michelin agreed to transfer control of the business.\nIn December 1974 Peugeot S.A. acquired a 38.2% share of Citro\u00ebn and on 9 April 1976 they increased their stake of the then bankrupt company to 89.95%, thus creating the \"PSA Group\" (where PSA is short for Peugeot &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Anonyme\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme&lt;/a&gt;), becoming &lt;a href=\"PSA%20Peugeot%20Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 1975 &lt;a href=\"Maserati\"&gt;Maserati&lt;/a&gt; was sold to &lt;a href=\"De%20Tomaso\"&gt;De Tomaso&lt;/a&gt; and the new Italian owner was thereby able to exploit the sales potential of the models and technology developed by Citro\u00ebn, as well as to utilise the image of the Maserati &lt;a href=\"Aspirational%20brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; in a downward &lt;a href=\"brand%20extension\"&gt;brand extension&lt;/a&gt; to sell 40,000 of the newly designed &lt;a href=\"Maserati%20Biturbo\"&gt;Bi-Turbo&lt;/a&gt; models. The truck manufacturing company &lt;a href=\"Berliet\"&gt;Berliet&lt;/a&gt; was sold to &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis new PSA venture was a financial success from 1976 to 1979. Citro\u00ebn had two successful new designs in the market, the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20GS\"&gt;GS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20CX\"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the oil crisis, the brand also had resurgent sales for the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%202CV\"&gt;2CV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Dyane\"&gt;Dyane&lt;/a&gt;, and soon the &lt;a href=\"Peugeot%20104\"&gt;Peugeot 104&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Visa\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Visa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20LNA\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn LNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Peugeot\"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; was typically prudent with its own finances. Then, PSA purchased the ageing assets and substantial liabilities of &lt;a href=\"Chrysler%20Europe\"&gt;Chrysler Europe&lt;/a&gt; for $1, leading to losses from 1980 to 1985. PSA resurrected the &lt;a href=\"Talbot%23Decline%20and%20Demise\"&gt;Talbot&lt;/a&gt; name for the Chrysler cars, but stopped producing cars with the badge in 1987 as the cars were considered unreliable and poorly-made.\nConflict with the Trade unions.\nIn the early 1980s, Citro\u00ebn was targeted by union action. On 25 May 1982, events led to a mass demonstration in the streets of Paris, when approximately 27,000 workers affirmed their wish to work at a company, which was being picketed by striking workers who had been blocking access to the factories for four weeks. The demonstration was successful and six days later work at the plants resumed. Jacques Lombard, one of the company's senior managers, had gone public with his concerns, criticising the strikes.\nChanging design language.\nPSA gradually diluted Citro\u00ebn's &lt;a href=\"Unique%20selling%20proposition\"&gt;ambitious, highly individualistic, and distinctive&lt;/a&gt; approach to engineering and styling. All through the 1980s, Citro\u00ebn models became increasingly Peugeot-like. The 1982 &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20BX\"&gt;BX&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"hydropneumatic\"&gt;hydropneumatic&lt;/a&gt; suspension system and had a typical \"Citro\u00ebnesque\" appearance, whilst being powered by Peugeot-derived engines and using the floorpan later seen on the &lt;a href=\"Peugeot%20405\"&gt;Peugeot 405&lt;/a&gt;. In this respect PSA followed the worldwide motor industry trend of &lt;a href=\"Car%20platform\"&gt;platform sharing&lt;/a&gt; which is a logical way to reduce costs whilst selling apparently different models. By the late 1980s, many of the distinctive features of the brand had been removed or altered - Peugeot's conventional switchgear replacing Citro\u00ebn's quirky but ergonomic \"Lunule\" designs, complete with self-cancelling indicators that Citro\u00ebn had refused to adopt on ergonomic grounds. The cars were \"more banal and conventional\", but also able to break into new markets, like fleet vehicles in the UK.\nGeographic expansion.\nIn the meantime Citro\u00ebn expanded into many new global markets. Beyond existing manufacturing plants in &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, it added &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late 1970s, the firm developed a small car for production in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Oltcit\"&gt;Oltcit&lt;/a&gt;, which it sold in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Axel\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Axel&lt;/a&gt;. That joint venture has now ended, but a new one between PSA and &lt;a href=\"Toyota\"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; is now producing cars like the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C1\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C1&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dongfeng%20Peugeot-Citro%C3%ABn%20Automobile\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; joint venture began selling cars in 1984 and building them in 1994. The current range of family cars there includes the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C3\"&gt;C3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Xsara\"&gt;Xsara&lt;/a&gt; and locally designed cars like the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Fukang\"&gt;Fukang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Elys%C3%A9e\"&gt;Elys\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; models. The brand has recently increased its Chinese sales by 30% - in an overall market growth of 11% - and ranks highest in the 2014 customer satisfaction survey by JD Power in China.\nCitro\u00ebn is a global brand, except in North America, where the company has not returned since the SM &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20SM%23US%20exports\"&gt;was effectively banned in 1974&lt;/a&gt; for not meeting U.S. &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration\"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NHTSA) bumper height regulations.\nIn 2016, Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn South Africa (PCSA) announced that they were going to stop importing new Citroen models into South Africa in order to focus on increasing Peugeot's sales in the country. In May 2019, it was reported that PCSA would re-introduce the Citroen brand into South Africa, this was later confirmed by PCSA, in August 2019, that new Citroen models will go on sale in the middle of October 2019.\nThe recent decade.\nFrom 2003 to 2010, Citro\u00ebn produced the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C3\"&gt;C3&lt;/a&gt; Pluriel, an unusual convertible with allusions to the 1948\u20131990 2CV model, both in body style (such as the bonnet) and in its all-round practicality.\nIn 2001 it celebrated its history of innovation when it opened a museum of its many significant vehicles: the Conservatoire with 300 cars.\nIn line with the severe decline in European car sales after 2009, worldwide sales of vehicles declined from 1,460,373 in 2010 to 1,435,688 in 2011, with 961,156 of these sold in Europe.\nIn 2011 the PSA Group was close to forming a partnership with BMW, for the development of electric and hybrid vehicles, but the talks fell through, shortly after Groupe PSA, Citro\u00ebn's parent company, had announced a partnership with GM, which later also failed.\n&lt;a href=\"Dongfeng%20Peugeot-Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;Dongfeng Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; continues growing, and has developed eight new car designs exclusively for the China market. Currently in China, Citro\u00ebn (and &lt;a href=\"Peugeot\"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt;) face the same challenge as &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen\"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;: there are too many &lt;a href=\"sedan%20%28automobile%29\"&gt;sedans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hatchbacks\"&gt;hatchbacks&lt;/a&gt;, but not enough models in the strong selling &lt;a href=\"SUV\"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"minivan\"&gt;minivan&lt;/a&gt;/MPV categories.\nThe brand ranked highest in the 2014 customer satisfaction survey by JD Power in China, above luxury brands like &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, and above mass market brands, like Volkswagen, ranking only thirteenth and seventeenth respectively. In the first ten months of 2014 in China, the sales of Donfeng Citro\u00ebn cars increased by 30% in an overall market growth of 11%.\nDespite the near-death financial experience of &lt;a href=\"PSA%20Peugeot%20Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, and financial rescue by &lt;a href=\"Dongfeng%20Motors\"&gt;Dongfeng Motors&lt;/a&gt;, the Citro\u00ebn and DS brands are developing new technologies and are both hoping to grow 15% by 2020, according to Citro\u00ebn &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; Linda Jackson and DS &lt;a href=\"CEO\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yves%20Bonnefont\"&gt;Yves Bonnefont&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2020, &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Jackson%20%28businesswoman%29\"&gt;Linda Jackson&lt;/a&gt; was succeeded as CEO of Citro\u00ebn by the deputy CEO &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Cob%C3%A9e\"&gt;Vincent Cob\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, and she would instead \"lead a study to clarify and support brand differentiation within a brand portfolio\".\nCitroen will enter the Indian market in early 2021 with the launch of the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C5%20Aircross\"&gt;C5 Aircross SUV.&lt;/a&gt; Citroen cars will be manufactured at Citroen's Thiruvallur plant in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, India.\nThe DS brand.\nIn early 2009, Citro\u00ebn announced the development of the premium brand DS, for Different Spirit or Distinctive Series - although the reference to the historical &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn DS&lt;/a&gt; is evident - to run in parallel to its mainstream cars. The slogan of the DS car marque is \"Spirit of avant-garde\".\nThis new series of cars started early in 2010, with the &lt;a href=\"DS%203\"&gt;DS3&lt;/a&gt;, a small car based on the floorpan of the new C3. The &lt;a href=\"DS%203\"&gt;DS3&lt;/a&gt; is based on the concept that preceded the &lt;a href=\"C3%20Pluriel\"&gt;C3 Pluriel&lt;/a&gt; production model and the &lt;a href=\"DS%20Inside\"&gt;DS Inside&lt;/a&gt; concept car. The &lt;a href=\"DS%203\"&gt;DS3&lt;/a&gt; is customisable with various roof colours contrasting with the body panels; it was named 2010 \"Car of the Year\" by \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20Gear%20Magazine\"&gt;Top Gear Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\", and was awarded best supermini four times in a row by the JD Power Satisfaction Survey UK and second most efficient supermini (Citro\u00ebn DS3 1.6 e-HDi 115 Airdream : True MPG 63.0mpg) by \"What car ?\" behind the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C3\"&gt;C3&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013 the &lt;a href=\"DS%203\"&gt;DS3&lt;/a&gt; was again the best-selling premium subcompact car, with 40% of the European market share, validating the business model of this product development.\nThe DS series is deeply connected to Citro\u00ebn, as the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS4\"&gt;DS4&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2010, is based on the 2008 &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Hypnos\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Hypnos&lt;/a&gt; concept car and the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS5\"&gt;DS5&lt;/a&gt;, which followed in 2015 being based on the 2005 &lt;a href=\"C-SportLounge\"&gt;C-SportLounge&lt;/a&gt; concept car.\nThe rear badge is a new DS logo rather than the familiar Citro\u00ebn double chevron and all will have markedly different styling from their equivalent sister cars. Citro\u00ebn has produced several dramatic looking concept sports cars of late, with the fully working &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Survolt\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Survolt&lt;/a&gt; being badged as a DS. Indeed, the 2014 &lt;a href=\"DS%20Divine\"&gt;DS Divine&lt;/a&gt; concept car develops the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Survolt\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Survolt&lt;/a&gt; prototype as the future sport coup\u00e9 of the DS range.\nIn China, Citro\u00ebn has standalone DS showrooms, as well as entire plants built specifically for the production of these vehicles. Since 2014 Citro\u00ebn has sold the Chinese-built &lt;a href=\"DS%205LS\"&gt;DS 5LS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DS%206WR\"&gt;DS 6WR&lt;/a&gt; in China.\nAwards.\nCitro\u00ebn was recognised in the 1999 &lt;a href=\"Car%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;Car of the Century&lt;/a&gt; competition as producing the third most influential car of the 20th century, the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn DS&lt;/a&gt;, behind the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Model%20T\"&gt;Ford Model T&lt;/a&gt; and BMC &lt;a href=\"Mini\"&gt;Mini&lt;/a&gt;.\nCitro\u00ebn has produced three winners of the 50-year-old &lt;a href=\"European%20Car%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;European Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award, and many rated second or third place.\nCitro\u00ebn has produced one winner of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Trend%20Car%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;\"Motor Trend\" Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award \u2013 the original &lt;a href=\"Car%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt; designation, which began in 1949. This was especially significant because this award used to be only given to cars designed and built in the United States.\nCitro\u00ebn has produced eight \"Auto Europa\" winners in 28 years, since 1987. \"Auto Europa\" is the prize awarded by the jury of the Italian Union of Automotive Journalists (UIGA), which annually celebrates the best car produced at least at 10,000 units in the 27 countries of the European Union: &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20XM\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn XM&lt;/a&gt; (1990), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20ZX\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn ZX&lt;/a&gt; (1992), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Xantia\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Xantia&lt;/a&gt; (1994), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Xsara%20Picasso\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Xsara Picasso&lt;/a&gt; (2001), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C5\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C5&lt;/a&gt; (2002), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C3\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C3&lt;/a&gt; (2003), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C4\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C4&lt;/a&gt; (2005) and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS4\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn DS4&lt;/a&gt; (2012).\nCitro\u00ebn Racing.\nCitro\u00ebn Racing, previously known as Citro\u00ebn Sport and before that as Citro\u00ebn Competitions, is the team responsible for Citro\u00ebn's sporting activities. It is a successful winning competitor in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Rally%20Championship\"&gt;World Rally Championship&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Touring%20Car%20Championship\"&gt;World Touring Car Championship&lt;/a&gt;. They also currently have supply engines to &lt;a href=\"DS%20Virgin%20Racing\"&gt;DS Virgin Racing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Formula%20E\"&gt;Formula E&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly rally wins for Citro\u00ebn vehicles.\nCitro\u00ebn vehicles were entered in endurance &lt;a href=\"Rallying\"&gt;rally driving&lt;/a&gt; events beginning in 1956, with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;. The brand was successful and won many key events over a decades long period, with what was essentially the same production car design.\nRacing the 2CV.\nCitro\u00ebn discovered that while racing the uniquely slow &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%202CV\"&gt;2CV&lt;/a&gt; against other cars made little sense, they could be interesting to watch racing against each other. Citro\u00ebn Competitions sponsored three long distance competitions \u2013 Paris-Kaboul-Paris in 1970, Paris-Persepolis-Paris in 1972, and Raid Afrique in 1973.\nEnthusiasts carried on the tradition with \"2CV Cross\" \u2013 a group of 2CV's racing around a dirt track \u2013 a sport that continues today.\nRebuilding the competition group.\nThe Citro\u00ebn Competitions division was impacted negatively by the firm's 1974 bankruptcy.\nCompetitive rallying was also changing \u2013 away from standard production cars to specially developed low volume models. In response to the entry of the competitive short wheel base &lt;a href=\"Group%20B\"&gt;Group B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"4%20wheel%20drive\"&gt;4 wheel drive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Audi%20Quattro\"&gt;Audi Quattro&lt;/a&gt; into rallying, Citro\u00ebn developed the heavily modified &lt;a href=\"Group%20B\"&gt;Group B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20BX%234TC\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn BX 4TC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1986%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team returned successfully with the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20ZX\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn ZX&lt;/a&gt; Rally Raid to win the &lt;a href=\"Rally%20Raid\"&gt;Rally Raid&lt;/a&gt; Manufacturer's Championship five times (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997) with &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Lartigue\"&gt;Pierre Lartigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ari%20Vatanen\"&gt;Ari Vatanen&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20World%20Rally%20Team\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn WRC Team&lt;/a&gt; pilot &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9bastien%20Loeb\"&gt;S\u00e9bastien Loeb&lt;/a&gt; also won nine &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20Drivers%27%20Champions\"&gt;Drivers' Championships&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004, 2005, and &lt;a href=\"2006%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, the French pilot won the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20Drivers%27%20Champions\"&gt;Drivers' Championship&lt;/a&gt;, driving the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Xsara\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Xsara WRC&lt;/a&gt;, in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 with the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C4\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C4 WRC&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2011 and 2012 with the new &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS3\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn DS3 WRC&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20World%20Rally%20Team\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn World Rally Team&lt;/a&gt; has a record of 97 victories in the World Rally Championship.\nNew competition division for touring cars.\nIn 2012, Citro\u00ebn announced plans to enter the &lt;a href=\"World%20Touring%20Car%20Championship\"&gt;World Touring Car Championship&lt;/a&gt;. The team transformed a &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20DS3%20WRC\"&gt;DS3 WRC&lt;/a&gt; into a laboratory vehicle to help with early development, while the engine was an evolution of their WRC engine which had been used in the WRC since 2011. Citro\u00ebn started developing the car for the new TC1 regulations, which were brought forward a year early in 2014 to expedite the entry of Citro\u00ebn into the championship. The introduction of the new regulations a year earlier than planned gave a seven-month development headstart to Citro\u00ebn over the other manufacturers. This large development advantage combined with a big budget and a strong driver line-up made Citro\u00ebn the clear favourite going into the first season of the new regulations in 2014. Citro\u00ebn would go on to win most of the races that season as well as the manufacturers' title, while &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt; won the drivers' title. The team would repeat this feat in 2015 and 2016, before the factory team left the series at the end of 2016. A number of Citro\u00ebns were still raced by other teams in 2017, but were outpaced by the Hondas and the Volvos.\nConcept cars.\nCitro\u00ebn has produced numerous &lt;a href=\"concept%20cars\"&gt;concept cars&lt;/a&gt; over the decades, previewing future design trends or technologies. Notable concepts include the &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Karin\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Karin&lt;/a&gt; (1980), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Activa\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Activa&lt;/a&gt; (1988), &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20C-M%C3%A9tisse\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn C-M\u00e9tisse&lt;/a&gt; (2006), &lt;a href=\"GT%20by%20Citro%C3%ABn\"&gt;GT by Citro\u00ebn&lt;/a&gt; (2008) and &lt;a href=\"Citro%C3%ABn%20Survolt\"&gt;Citro\u00ebn Survolt&lt;/a&gt; (2010).\nLogo.\nThe origin of the logo may be traced back to a trip made by the 22-year-old Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn to &lt;a href=\"%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt; city, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, where he discovered an innovative design for a &lt;a href=\"Chevron%20%28insignia%29\"&gt;chevron&lt;/a&gt;-shaped &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Milling%20%28grinding%29\"&gt;milling&lt;/a&gt;. He bought the patent for its application in steel. Mechanically a gear with &lt;a href=\"helix\"&gt;helical&lt;/a&gt; teeth produces an axial force. By adding a second helical gear in opposition, this force is cancelled. The two &lt;a href=\"chevron%20%28insignia%29\"&gt;chevron&lt;/a&gt;s of the logo represent the intermeshing contact of the two. Early Citro\u00ebn cars used a herringbone bevel gear &lt;a href=\"final%20drive\"&gt;final drive&lt;/a&gt; in the rear axle.\nThe presentation of the logo has evolved over time. Before the war, it was rendered in yellow on a blue background. After the war, the chevrons became more subtle &lt;a href=\"Herringbone%20pattern\"&gt;herringbones&lt;/a&gt;, usually on a white background. With the company searching for a new image during the 1980s, the logo became white on red to give an impression of dynamism.\nOn 5 February 2009 Citro\u00ebn launched a new brand identity to celebrate its 90th anniversary, replacing the 1985 design. The new logo was designed by Landor Associates \u2014 a 3D metallic variation of the double chevron logo accompanied by a new font for the Citro\u00ebn name and the new slogan \"Cr\u00e9ative Technologie\". A TV campaign reminiscing over of Citro\u00ebn was commissioned to announce the new identity to the public. \nFactories.\nSome joint venture models are manufactured in third party or joint venture factories, including the following:"
