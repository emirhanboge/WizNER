The river flows into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Huron\"&gt;Lake Huron&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of the \"tip\" of the \"thumb\".\nThe entire length of the Pinnebog lies within &lt;a href=\"Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Huron County&lt;/a&gt; and is fed by various agricultural ditches and drains. It is formed by the confluence of the Colona and Colfax drains near the southern boundary of &lt;a href=\"section%20%28land%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; 28 in &lt;a href=\"Colfax%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Colfax Township&lt;/a&gt;, on the south side of &lt;a href=\"M-53%20%28Michigan%20highway%29\"&gt;M-53&lt;/a&gt; (Van Dyke Rd.) about south-southwest of &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Axe%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Bad Axe&lt;/a&gt;. It flows southwest for about around the &lt;a href=\"unincorporated%20community\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Popple%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Popple&lt;/a&gt; where it is fed by the Cameron and McLean drains. It then bends northward around Popple and flows northwest for about past the east side of the village of &lt;a href=\"Elkton%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Elkton&lt;/a&gt;. North of Elkton, the river flows mostly northward to its mouth in Lake Huron in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Crescent%20State%20Park\"&gt;Port Crescent State Park&lt;/a&gt; at , about southwest of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Austin%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Port Austin&lt;/a&gt;. Other tributaries include the Elkton Drain, Nettle Run, Hill Drain, Southworth Drain, McMullen Drain, Oliver Drain, Bad Axe Creek, Musselman Drain (which empties Rush Lake in the &lt;a href=\"Rush%20Lake%20State%20Game%20Area\"&gt;Rush Lake State Game Area&lt;/a&gt;. Before reaching Lake Huron, it turns to flow east-northeast for about to its mouth. Just before its mouth, it is joined by the Taft and Schram drains.\nThe river's watershed drains all or portions of the following townships: \n&lt;a href=\"Bingham%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Bingham&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Chandler%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Chandler&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Colfax%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Colfax&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Dwight%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Dwight&lt;/a&gt;,\n&lt;a href=\"Hume%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Hume&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Meade%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Meade&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, \n&lt;a href=\"Sheridan%20Township%2C%20Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Sheridan&lt;/a&gt;, and \n&lt;a href=\"Verona%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"unincorporated%20community\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pinnebog%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Pinnebog&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the Taft Drain.
