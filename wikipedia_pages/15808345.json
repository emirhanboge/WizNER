They include Nevada, which administers several tests as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nevada%20Proficiency%20Examination%20Program\"&gt;Nevada Proficiency Examination Program&lt;/a&gt;. They include the &lt;a href=\"High%20School%20Proficiency%20Examination\"&gt;High School Proficiency Examination&lt;/a&gt; for Reading and Mathematics; the &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Test%20of%20Basic%20Skills\"&gt;Iowa Test of Basic Skills&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Tests%20of%20Educational%20Development\"&gt;Iowa Tests of Educational Development&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Criterion-referenced%20test\"&gt;Criterion-referenced test&lt;/a&gt;s in Reading, Mathematics, and Science; &lt;a href=\"Language%20Proficiency%20Assessment\"&gt;Language Proficiency Assessment&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Nevada%20Alternate%20Scales%20of%20Academic%20Achievement\"&gt;Nevada Alternate Scales of Academic Achievement&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Assessment%20of%20Educational%20Progress\"&gt;National Assessment of Educational Progress&lt;/a&gt;.

Alabama requires the &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Achievement%20Test%20Series\"&gt;Stanford Achievement Test Series&lt;/a&gt;; and in Texas, the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Higher%20Education%20Assessment\"&gt;Texas Higher Education Assessment&lt;/a&gt;. That state has discontinued its usage of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Assessment%20of%20Academic%20Skills\"&gt;Texas Assessment of Academic Skills&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 2007\u201308 school year, Kentucky has required that all students at public high schools take the &lt;a href=\"ACT%20%28test%29\"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt; in their junior year."
