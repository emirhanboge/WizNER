    "text": "S\u00edrl\u00e1m, son of &lt;a href=\"Finn%20mac%20Blatha\"&gt;Finn mac Blatha&lt;/a&gt;, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;High King of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. He took power after killing his predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Lugaid%20%C3%8Dardonn\"&gt;Lugaid \u00cdardonn&lt;/a&gt;, in R\u00e1th Clochair. His name means \"long hand\" or \"long arm\", and it is said his arms reached the ground when was standing up (compare the Irish &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lugh\"&gt;Lug&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"epithet\"&gt;epithet&lt;/a&gt; \"l\u00e1mfada\" also means \"long arm\"). He ruled for thirteen years according to the \"&lt;a href=\"Lebor%20Gab%C3%A1la%20%C3%89renn\"&gt;Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn&lt;/a&gt;\", or sixteen according to &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Keating\"&gt;Geoffrey Keating&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20Four%20Masters\"&gt;Four Masters&lt;/a&gt;. He drove Lugaid's son &lt;a href=\"Eochu%20Uairches\"&gt;Eochu Uairches&lt;/a&gt; into exile, but after twelve years overseas Eochu returned and killed him with an arrow. The \"Lebor Gab\u00e1la\" synchronises his reign with that of &lt;a href=\"Artaxerxes%20I%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Artaxerxes I of Persia&lt;/a&gt; (465\u2013424 BC). The chronology of Keating's \"Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn\" dates his reign to 649\u2013633 BC, that of the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" to 872\u2013856 BC."
