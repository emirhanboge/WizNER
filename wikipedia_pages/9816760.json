    "text": "Walter Carlisle (6 July 1881 \u2013 27 May 1945) was an English-born &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in the early 20th century. He played briefly in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) for the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; during the 1908 season. Nicknamed \"Rosy\", he was a &lt;a href=\"switch-hitter\"&gt;switch-hitter&lt;/a&gt; and threw right-handed. Carlisle is best remember for successfully executing an &lt;a href=\"unassisted%20triple%20play\"&gt;unassisted triple play&lt;/a&gt; as an outfielder in 1911.\nBiography.\nCarlisle was born in &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%2C%20England\"&gt;Yorkshire, England&lt;/a&gt;, and played baseball professionally in the United States during 1902\u20131918, 1920, and 1923. He played in over 2200 &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; games; records for some of his minor-league seasons are missing or incomplete. For seasons with records available, he had a career-high &lt;a href=\"Batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; of .304 in 150 games for the &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Tigers\"&gt;Lincoln Tigers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20League%20%281900%E2%80%931958%29\"&gt;Western League&lt;/a&gt; in 1916.\nCarlisle is credited with playing in three &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; games, all in May 1908 as a &lt;a href=\"left%20fielder\"&gt;left fielder&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;. He registered one hit in 10 &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;s while &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;striking out&lt;/a&gt; four times; he also had one &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stolen base&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile playing in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Vernon%20Tigers\"&gt;Vernon Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, Carlisle executed an &lt;a href=\"unassisted%20triple%20play\"&gt;unassisted triple play&lt;/a&gt; on July 19, 1911, against &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20%28PCL%29\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt;. With the score tied at 3\u20133 in the sixth inning, and runners on &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; bases, Carlisle made a diving catch of a short fly batted by Roy Akin, stepped on second to retire &lt;a href=\"Charley%20Moore\"&gt;Charley Moore&lt;/a&gt;, and tagged George Metzger coming from first. The Tigers won the game, 5\u20134. With his rare feat, Carlisle entered the record books as the first, and to date only, &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; known to have made an unassisted triple play in professional baseball. According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporting%20News\"&gt;The Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\", Carlisle had at one point been a circus acrobat, which may have helped account for the bit of extra athleticism he showed in making the tumbling play. During the following season, Akin pulled off his own unassisted triple play, as a &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarlisle died in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 63."
