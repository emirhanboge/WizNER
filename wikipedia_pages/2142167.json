    "text": "Karan English (born March 23, 1949) served in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"103rd%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;103rd United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; from 1993 to 1995.\nA &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, English represented &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%2C%20Arizona%20District%206\"&gt;6th Congressional District&lt;/a&gt;, which in the 1990s included much of &lt;a href=\"Mesa%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt; and northeast Arizona. Prior to her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, English served as an &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Senate\"&gt;Arizona State Senator&lt;/a&gt; (1991\u20131993), &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;State Representative&lt;/a&gt; (1987\u20131991), and &lt;a href=\"Coconino%20County%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Coconino County&lt;/a&gt; supervisor (1981\u20131987). In the Arizona senate, English developed a reputation as a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; on fiscal, social and environmental issues.\nDespite being heavily outspent during her campaign, English won her 1992 General Election race against &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Wead\"&gt;Doug Wead&lt;/a&gt; after being endorsed by former &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Senator\"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Goldwater\"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt;. Goldwater said he thought Wead was out of touch with Arizona because of his relatively brief residency in the state\u2014two years to English's 22. Wead countered that Goldwater's support of abortion rights spurred the unexpected crossing of party lines. English may have also benefited from Democratic Party momentum in 1992, which was the year of &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s first presidential election victory. Clinton came within a few percentage points of winning Arizona, and two other Democratic Representatives (&lt;a href=\"Ed%20Pastor\"&gt;Ed Pastor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Coppersmith\"&gt;Sam Coppersmith&lt;/a&gt;) were elected along with English to give Democrats the majority of the state's House delegation.\nShe was the second woman to represent Arizona in Congress, with &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20Greenway\"&gt;Isabella Selmes Greenway&lt;/a&gt; (1933\u20131937) being the first.\nAfter serving a single term in Congress, English was defeated by Republican challenger &lt;a href=\"J.D.%20Hayworth\"&gt;J.D. Hayworth&lt;/a&gt; in 1994.\nShe is now involved with the Center for Sustainable Environments at &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Arizona%20University\"&gt;Northern Arizona University&lt;/a&gt; and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of &lt;a href=\"Issue%20One\"&gt;Issue One&lt;/a&gt;."
