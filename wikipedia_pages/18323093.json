    "title": "Skyscape art",
    "text": "Skyscape art depicts representations of the &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt;, especially in a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"photograph\"&gt;photograph&lt;/a&gt;. Skyscapes differ from &lt;a href=\"cloudscape%20%28art%29\"&gt;cloudscape&lt;/a&gt;s because they do not necessarily include &lt;a href=\"cloud\"&gt;cloud&lt;/a&gt;s. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called \"skyscapes\" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.\nThe view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of &lt;a href=\"landscape\"&gt;landscape&lt;/a&gt; is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, &lt;a href=\"rainbow\"&gt;rainbow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"aurorae\"&gt;aurorae&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"artist\"&gt;artist&lt;/a&gt;s also depict &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s and other flying objects, as well as manmade &lt;a href=\"aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;s and objects such as &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"balloon\"&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, &lt;a href=\"printmaking\"&gt;printmaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"serigraphy\"&gt;serigraphy&lt;/a&gt; and photography.\n&lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt; is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.\nThe sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth\u2019s &lt;a href=\"atmosphere\"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Sky can be depicted as many different &lt;a href=\"color\"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt;s, such as a pale &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; or the lack of any color at all, such as the &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of &lt;a href=\"star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;s on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; reflected on the &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere\u2013an imaginary dome divided into constellations\u2013where the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s, stars and &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; seem to visually move across the sky.\nAlthough artists have long painted the sky it was &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Hopper\"&gt;Edward Hopper&lt;/a&gt; who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds. In the 1950s, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Sloane\"&gt;Eric Sloane&lt;/a&gt; painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in &lt;a href=\"Taos%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Taos, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling &lt;a href=\"mural\"&gt;mural&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Central%20Terminal\"&gt;Grand Central Terminal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;."
