    "text": "Bicycle lighting is illumination attached to bicycles whose purpose above all is, along with reflectors, to improve the visibility of the &lt;a href=\"bicycle\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt; and its rider to other road users under circumstances of poor ambient illumination. A secondary purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as &lt;a href=\"cat%27s%20eye%20%28road%29\"&gt;cat's eye&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"traffic%20sign\"&gt;traffic sign&lt;/a&gt;s. A third purpose may be to &lt;a href=\"illuminating\"&gt;illuminate&lt;/a&gt; the roadway so that the rider can see the way ahead. Serving the latter purposes require much more luminous flux and thus more power.\nMany jurisdictions require one or more bicycle lights to be fitted to bicycles ridden at night \u2014 generally a white light in the front and a red light at the back, like with other vehicles.\nHistory.\nFire.\nThe earliest bicycle lamps were oil-fueled and started to be manufactured in 1876 for the Ordinary (High-Bicycle) and solid-tired tricycles. From 1896, acetylene gas lighting for bicycles started to be introduced and later in 1899, acetylene gas lamps for the motor-car became popular. Their &lt;a href=\"carbide%20lamp\"&gt;carbide lamp&lt;/a&gt;s were powered by &lt;a href=\"acetylene%20gas\"&gt;acetylene gas&lt;/a&gt;, produced by combining &lt;a href=\"calcium%20carbide\"&gt;calcium carbide&lt;/a&gt; with water. The light given was very bright, often called artificial daylight but the lamps required regular maintenance.\nElectricity.\nFrom as early as 1888, electric-powered bicycle lamps were manufactured but did not become a viable proposition until 1898. They comprised an incandescent bulb and either a &lt;a href=\"lead-acid%20battery\"&gt;lead-acid battery&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"dynamo\"&gt;dynamo&lt;/a&gt;. Lead-acid batteries were replaced by &lt;a href=\"Battery%20%28electricity%29\"&gt;dry cells&lt;/a&gt; and later by &lt;a href=\"alkaline%20battery\"&gt;alkaline batteries&lt;/a&gt;. Dynamos improved in efficiency and reliability, recently being incorporated into the wheel hub, for example. Moulding techniques for plastics also improved, allowing &lt;a href=\"Lens%20%28optics%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"optics\"&gt;optics&lt;/a&gt; to be improved and cost reduced. Incandescent bulbs were replaced first by &lt;a href=\"halogen%20lamp\"&gt;halogen lamp&lt;/a&gt;s and later by &lt;a href=\"light%20emitting%20diodes\"&gt;light emitting diodes&lt;/a&gt; (LEDs).\nHalogen lights.\nAlthough these lights were originally designed for off-road use, where they were almost universal, rechargeable halogen lights became popular with commuter cyclists.\nThe lights used by most halogen rechargeable systems were cheap and bright, but fairly simple: they projected a cone of light (wide and narrow beam options were available) which is good for off-road use but not ideal for road use as it can dazzle oncoming road users. This is why halogen lights do not meet legal requirements in some jurisdictions.\nMany systems used standard commercial prefocused optics, making a wide range of power and beam width combinations available. Most systems allowed simultaneous connection of different lamps - for example, a wide and a narrow beam for off-road riding, or a high- and a low-power beam for road riding.\nHID lights.\n&lt;a href=\"High-intensity%20discharge\"&gt;High-intensity discharge&lt;/a&gt; (HID) lights were a brighter/more efficient alternative to filament bulbs prior to the widespread adoption of LEDs. Like halogen systems, they were designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. HID lamps were susceptible to damage from repeated strikes, and in many cases did not relight immediately after shutting down. Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp would shut down rather than dimming. But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders would simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.\nXenon strobes.\nXenon strobes were an innovation in bicycle lighting; previously common in industrial applications. They were brighter than LEDs and sometimes used as rear lights. \nLighting system.\nElectrical system.\n&lt;a href=\"battery%20%28electricity%29\"&gt;Batteries&lt;/a&gt;, either &lt;a href=\"rechargeable\"&gt;rechargeable&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"disposable\"&gt;disposable&lt;/a&gt;, are often used to power electric bicycle lights. Where batteries are unwanted a &lt;a href=\"magneto\"&gt;magneto&lt;/a&gt; is used. In cycling circles the device is called a dynamo even though the device does not have a commutator. See section &lt;a href=\"Bicycle%20lighting%23Dynamo%20systems\"&gt;Dynamo systems&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nVoltages.\n3 volt:\nOften supplied by 2 AA or C/D cell batteries.\n6 volt:\nSometimes 4 AA batteries are used; also supplied from a bottle-shaped battery or hub dynamos, and lead-acid batteries\n9 volt:\nSometimes supplied by a &lt;a href=\"PP3%20battery\"&gt;PP3 battery&lt;/a&gt;\n12 volt:\nMostly supplied by &lt;a href=\"sealed%20lead-acid%20battery\"&gt;sealed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lead-acid%20battery\"&gt;lead-acid batteries&lt;/a&gt;. The main advantage with this voltage is versatility of the electric system, such as the ability to charge a cell phone battery with a &lt;a href=\"cigar%20lighter%20receptacle\"&gt;cigar lighter receptacle&lt;/a&gt; as cell phones are now becoming increasingly ubiquitous among users, though 5 volt USB is also used for that purpose too. It also allows electric air compressors to inflate tires. Some 12-volt dynamos are available too, though their watt rating is underpowered for medium to high watt applications.\nLight sources.\nVirtually all bicycle lights on the market today, from the cheapest to the most expensive, are based on &lt;a href=\"LED\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegal requirements.\nUnder the International &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic\"&gt;Vienna Convention on Road Traffic&lt;/a&gt; (1968) of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, a bicycle is a vehicle. Article 44 of the Convention stipulates that: \"Cycles without an engine in international traffic shall: (c) Be equipped with a red reflecting device at the rear and with devices such that the cycle can show a white or &lt;a href=\"selective-yellow\"&gt;selective-yellow&lt;/a&gt; light to the front and a red light to the rear.\" In some countries, for example &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, it may be an offence even to sell a bicycle not fitted with legally compliant lighting system. However, not all countries impose this requirement on cyclists.\nMany jurisdictions require bicycles to be fitted with reflectors at the point of sale. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; this is regulated by the &lt;a href=\"Consumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission\"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt;. CPSC compliant reflectors (also commonly fitted in other markets) have three retro-reflective panels positioned at 30\u00b0 angles. The standard requires a forward-facing white reflector on the front of the bicycle, sideways-facing white reflectors on each wheel, a red reflector mounted on the rear, and yellow reflectors installed on the front and back of each pedal. Some interpret this as an endorsement of reflector-only night cycling.\nMany jurisdictions require the use of a headlight and a rear light or reflector after dark. Most European countries and some US states require front and rear lights at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of lamp and reflector lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some stipulate a minimum distance from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others, they are allowed.\nIn the UK, the regulations governing bicycle lights are set out in the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 and their subsequent amendments, summarized in the Highway Code. The regulations require a white front light, a red rear light, a red rear reflector,\nand amber/yellow pedal reflectors on the front and rear of both pedals.\nReflectors must conform to BS 6102/2 or an equivalent European standard. The situation for lights is more complicated:\nThe majority of LED lights available are not approved for UK use since they have steady modes that do not conform to BS 6102/3. It is, however, legal to fit additional lights providing that they are of the correct colour, they do not dazzle other road users and that if they flash, they do so at a constant rate of between 60 and 240 flashes per minute.\nNational cyclists' organisations such as &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20American%20Bicyclists\"&gt;LAB&lt;/a&gt; (US) or &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20UK\"&gt;CTC (UK)&lt;/a&gt; are a source of lighting information.\nSafety.\nThe use of lights for night riding is generally recommended or required by authorities as a basic safety precaution, even in a well-lit urban context. show a &lt;a href=\"correlation\"&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt; between collisions and failure to use lights even during daytime.\nIn countries where bicycles are used widely for commuting and short trips, such as the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, bicycle head- and tail lighting regulation is strictly enforced by the authorities.\nHowever, a study from 2013\nshows that different lighting regulations seem to have little influence on bicycle accident rates, and points out a lack of studies into the safety benefits of bicycle lighting.\nFront lighting.\nWhite &lt;a href=\"LED\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt;s are available with output ranging from a few &lt;a href=\"lumen%20%28unit%29\"&gt;lumen&lt;/a&gt;s to high-powered units producing about as much light as an automotive headlamp, suitable for high speed use on unlit trails. \nLED systems often include an option to dim the LEDs, or to provide a flashing light.\nLow-cost battery lights can be a good choice for occasional use, and usually meet legislative requirements. However, regular bicycle commuters would probably find it cost-effective to use rechargeable cells. Some headlamps use lithium-ion rechargeable battery packs, which may be recharged from a USB port.\nFlashlights.\nFlashlights, although not specifically designed for bicycle use, are a viable alternative. They can be fastened to the bicycle handlebars with various mounting devices such as a lock-block. The round light pattern of a general purpose flashlight is inferior to the beam of a bicycle headlamp properly shaped to illuminate the roadway and not provide excess glare to oncoming traffic.\nRear lighting.\nMost LED lights will work in either flashing or steady modes. Some LED lights have multiple banks of LEDs allowing both flashing and steady light at once. This can also be achieved by having one flashing light and one steady one.\nIn many countries, LED flashers are the norm for rear lights. In others such as &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; flashing lights are forbidden by law. In the UK flashing LEDs (front and rear) are legal from October 2005, provided that the lights conform to the requirements of the current Road Vehicles Lighting regulations. Many vendors claim EU compliance, however, this provides no consistent safety or legal value across the Union.\nThe most common power source for rear LEDs is a set of alkaline cells and rechargeable cells. In both cases the battery tends to fail quickly when it goes; it is widely considered a good practice to have two rear lights in case a battery fails en route.\nLow power lights are mainly for being seen, or as an emergency backup, and are the dominant choice for rear lights. Rear marker LED lamps may be operated on disposable coin-sized cells.\nPower supplies.\nBatteries.\nThe introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Low%20self-discharge%20NiMH%20battery\"&gt;Low self-discharge NiMH battery&lt;/a&gt; (LSD-NiMH) in 2005 made rechargeable &lt;a href=\"AA%20battery\"&gt;AA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AAA%20battery\"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; sized batteries more viable for powering &lt;a href=\"Light%20emitting%20diode\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt; bicycle lights. Previously, the self-discharge effect of &lt;a href=\"NiCAD\"&gt;NiCAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NiMH\"&gt;NiMH&lt;/a&gt; batteries caused the battery to run down over a period of weeks or a few months, even when not in use. This was particularly a problem for low powered LED lights, and for users who only used their bicycle lights occasionally. The LSD-NiMH battery greatly reduced the self-discharge effect, allowing the battery to keep its charge for a year or more.\nFor higher-powered lights, an external battery pack of 12V VRLA battery is often required. These battery packs usually strap to the top tube of the frame, or come in the shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can be placed in a basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though wire spaghetti from splicing can be a setback depending on how complicated the electric system is.\nAlternatively, &lt;a href=\"Li-ion\"&gt;Li-ion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LiPo\"&gt;LiPo&lt;/a&gt; batteries have been becoming more popular with bicyclists due to their &lt;a href=\"Power-to-weight%20ratio\"&gt;higher capacity and lighter weight&lt;/a&gt; compared with conventional batteries. More specifically, the 18650 battery, which has been popular with electric car manufacturers (for the same reasons) and are commonly found in laptops and flashlights.\nDynamo systems.\n&lt;a href=\"Dynamo\"&gt;Dynamo&lt;/a&gt; systems require no batteries and may be permanently fitted to the bike.\nBicycle dynamos are actually &lt;a href=\"magnetos\"&gt;magnetos&lt;/a&gt; and produce &lt;a href=\"alternating%20current\"&gt;alternating current&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nThere are three main types:\nOther types of dynamos exist, but are less common. For example, there are dynamos that are attached to the fork and driven by the wheel's spokes.\nOutput and optics.\nDynamos are generally limited to about 3 W of output power, although the best 12 V hub dynamos can produce 6 W at speed A bottle dynamo is likely to slip if run at twice the nominal power, a hub dynamo does not have this problem.\nAt speed a dynamo can overpower the lamp, causing it to fail. Historically this was a nuisance, but modern lamps and dynamos often incorporate &lt;a href=\"Zener%20diode\"&gt;Zener diode&lt;/a&gt;s to prevent overvoltage, and dynamos can be designed to saturate beyond a certain voltage to protect the lamp.\nGood dynamos can achieve efficiencies of up to 70% (i.e., under 5 W of the rider's output is diverted to produce 3 W of electricity) and provide good light output at low speeds.\nTo produce light when the bike is stationary, some dynamo lights have a \"stand light\" facility, usually a single blue-white (front light) or red (rear light) LED powered by a &lt;a href=\"capacitor\"&gt;capacitor&lt;/a&gt;, which runs for around five minutes.\nMagnetic lights.\nLights can be self-powered via &lt;a href=\"electromagnetic%20induction\"&gt;electromagnetic induction&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating the need for batteries or dynamo systems. The advantages are similar to those of dynamo lighting. The most common design includes a magnet on the wheel spoke and lights with a coil in them, mounted on the frame or fork of the bike. More exotic designs also exist; some have frame-mounted magnets and wheel-mounted lights, or a magnet and an &lt;a href=\"inductor\"&gt;inductor&lt;/a&gt; in one casing, using &lt;a href=\"eddy%20currents\"&gt;eddy currents&lt;/a&gt;.\nSupplementary lighting and visibility.\nHeadlamps.\nHeadlamps are a useful adjunct to bicycle lights. They can be pointed without steering the bike, giving useful fill-in lighting especially on poor or very dark roads. They have the added safety benefit of positioning the light higher on the cyclist for increased visibility. They also allow the wearer to read road and directional signs placed on high signposts. However, due to the high position of the light the &lt;a href=\"Glare%20%28vision%29\"&gt;glare&lt;/a&gt; may dazzle oncoming traffic.\nSome rechargeable systems offer a headlamp option powered from the main battery pack.\nReflective and high-visibility materials.\n&lt;a href=\"Retroreflector\"&gt;Retro-reflective materials&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of fixed reflectors, reflective tape, and reflective clothing, are useful in making a cyclist visible to other road users. Reflective materials can be applied to bike, rider, or luggage; also, tires are available with reflective sidewalls. Reflectives are visible only when in the beam of a headlight, and even then only within a narrow locus. Importantly, they \"do nothing to light up the road\". Reflectors are \"not\" a substitute for lights, but are an important supplement to portable lighting.\nOn the bike.\nReflectors and reflective tape provide additional visibility (especially when applied to moving parts of the bicycle) and are mandatory in many jurisdictions. Pedal reflectors in particular are very visible to following traffic as they move up and down; unfortunately they are not compatible with most clipless pedal systems, although adaptors are available for some, mainly older SPD models, and a few single-sided designs are available with built-in reflectors. In the UK, where front and rear pedal reflectors are compulsory after dark, most cyclists with clipless pedals are therefore riding illegally. The law is rarely if ever enforced, but could potentially be used in court to reduce financial compensation if the cyclist were to be hit by another vehicle. The &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20UK\"&gt;CTC&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that the requirement should be waived if the cyclist fits an additional rear reflector or lighting, but this was not changed in the last revision of the UK vehicle lighting laws (which permitted flashing LEDs). Riders of &lt;a href=\"recumbent%20bicycle\"&gt;recumbent bicycle&lt;/a&gt;s have pointed out that the pedal reflector requirement is nonsensical for them, since the reflectors point straight up and down in use, and are invisible from other vehicles. As of 2008, California law allows white or yellow shoe reflectors (front and back), or reflective ankle bands, in lieu of pedal reflectors.\nClothing.\nOn dark roads, retroreflective materials such as 3M's &lt;a href=\"Scotchlite\"&gt;Scotchlite&lt;/a&gt; will show up boldly in car headlights.\nThe colour of lighting should be checked in the rider's surroundings. A single solid colour can disappear under artificial light, particularly yellow sodium vapour lighting, and colour blindness is common; red/green colourblindness can make yellow fluorescent vanish against a green background (hedges or grass), although people with red/green colourblindness dispute this. Vests with both yellow and orange fluorescent areas plus wide strips of reflective may be the best solution.\nIn recent times &lt;a href=\"Electroluminescence\"&gt;electroluminescent&lt;/a&gt; clothing has become available to add to the existing array of LED-illuminated armbands and &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; blinkies.\nWheel-mounted lights.\nWheel-mounted lights are used to improve the visibility of a bike from the side. Due to &lt;a href=\"persistence%20of%20vision\"&gt;persistence of vision&lt;/a&gt;, individual lights mounted on the moving bike\u2019s wheel spokes are perceived as glowing arcs or circles. There are lights controlled with &lt;a href=\"Microcontroller\"&gt;MCU&lt;/a&gt; that are capable of rendering colorful patterns or animations. The glowing rims or wheels can isolate the bike from the visual noise of the city lights and help drivers see and immediately recognize a cyclist. Such lights are mainly battery-powered, but battery-free designs also exist.\nMeasures of light output.\nElectric power consumption in watts.\nThe watt (W) is the unit of &lt;a href=\"Power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;, and is usually quoted for the &lt;a href=\"electrical%20power\"&gt;electrical power&lt;/a&gt; input, not the light power output. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current (watts = &lt;a href=\"volt\"&gt;volt&lt;/a&gt;s \u00d7 &lt;a href=\"ampere\"&gt;ampere&lt;/a&gt;s). Input power is only useful when comparing lights of similar technologies.\nLuminous intensity in a given direction in candelas.\nThe candela (cd) is the &lt;a href=\"SI%20unit\"&gt;SI unit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"luminous%20intensity\"&gt;luminous intensity&lt;/a&gt;, that is power per unit &lt;a href=\"solid%20angle\"&gt;solid angle&lt;/a&gt; in a given direction, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. A typical &lt;a href=\"candle\"&gt;candle&lt;/a&gt; produces light with about 1 candela of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use of the power of the lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.\nTotal luminous flux in lumens.\nThe lumen (lm) is the SI unit for &lt;a href=\"luminous%20flux\"&gt;luminous flux&lt;/a&gt;, the total amount of light emitted by a source, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Lumens per watt is a common measure of the &lt;a href=\"efficacy\"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt; of a light source. The luminous flux is of less value for bicycle lighting due to the importance of directionality. Luminous intensity is much more useful, but lumens per watt is a handy way to compare the output of otherwise similar lights.\nIlluminance at a given distance in lux.\nThe lux (lx) is this SI unit for &lt;a href=\"illuminance\"&gt;illuminance&lt;/a&gt;, that is the amount of light that illuminates a surface (the road, in the case of a bike light) per unit area at a given point, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Some manufacturers indicate the illuminance their front lights provide to the road at a point located a standard distance right in front of the bicycle."
