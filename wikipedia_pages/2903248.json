    "text": "The Kyabram Fauna Park is a fauna park in &lt;a href=\"Kyabram%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Kyabram, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nUntil 1967, the current site of the Kyabram Fauna Park was a fallow farmland that had been abandoned for some years. In 1967, the need to utilize this piece of land was voiced during Kyabram's public meetings. The land had sat unused for 80 years and there was a general consensus on the need to improve and use it. A portion of the land served as a run-off site for rainwater. This was all that the land was used for. It was during this time that the idea to use the land as a wildlife park emerged. The proposal was accepted and work began on building the Kyabram Fauna Park.\nLaunched as a non-profit venture in 1976, the park is a sanctuary to over 400 species of animals who can all be viewed and many interacted with. The fauna park offers a walk through &lt;a href=\"aviary\"&gt;aviary&lt;/a&gt; and a heated &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt; house containing &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s and fresh-water &lt;a href=\"crocodile\"&gt;crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s. Other animals in the park include the &lt;a href=\"parma%20wallaby\"&gt;parma wallaby&lt;/a&gt;, the alpine &lt;a href=\"dingo\"&gt;dingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tasmanian%20devil\"&gt;Tasmanian devil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wombat\"&gt;wombat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"echidna\"&gt;echidna&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emu\"&gt;emu&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"koala\"&gt;koala&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wombat\"&gt;wombat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Barren%20goose\"&gt;Cape Barren geese&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe park is home to the cottage that French adventurer, navyman, and soldier &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Hazleman\"&gt;Theodore Hazleman&lt;/a&gt; built in 1867. Hazleman, before settling in the area, sailed the seas as a cabin boy and survived the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. In Kyabram he set up as a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farmer and fathered 13 children."
