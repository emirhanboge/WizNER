    "text": "Dresden (, ; &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Saxon%20German\"&gt;Upper Saxon&lt;/a&gt;: \"Dr\u00e4sdn\"; ) is the capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and its second most populous city, after &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Germany%20by%20population\"&gt;12th most populous city&lt;/a&gt; of Germany, the fourth largest by area (after &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;), and the third most populous city in the area of former &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, after Berlin and Leipzig. Dresden's urban area comprises the towns of &lt;a href=\"Freital\"&gt;Freital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pirna\"&gt;Pirna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radebeul\"&gt;Radebeul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meissen\"&gt;Mei\u00dfen (Meissen)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coswig%2C%20Saxony\"&gt;Coswig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radeberg\"&gt;Radeberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heidenau\"&gt;Heidenau&lt;/a&gt; and has around 790,000 inhabitants. The Dresden metropolitan area has approximately 1.34 million inhabitants.\nDresden is the second largest city on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Elbe\"&gt;River Elbe&lt;/a&gt; after Hamburg. Most of the city's population lives in the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Basin\"&gt;Elbe Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but a large, albeit very sparsely populated area of the city east of the Elbe lies in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Lusatian%20Hill%20Country%20and%20Uplands\"&gt;West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands&lt;/a&gt; (the westernmost part of the &lt;a href=\"Sudetes\"&gt;Sudetes&lt;/a&gt;) and thus in &lt;a href=\"Lusatia\"&gt;Lusatia&lt;/a&gt;, while many boroughs west of the Elbe lie in the &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Mountain%20Foreland\"&gt;foreland&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Mountains\"&gt;Ore Mountains&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the valleys of the rivers rising there and flowing through Dresden, the longest of which are the &lt;a href=\"Wei%C3%9Feritz\"&gt;Wei\u00dferitz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lockwitzbach\"&gt;Lockwitzbach&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the city as well as the names of most of its boroughs and rivers are of &lt;a href=\"Polabian%20Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; origin.\nDresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the &lt;a href=\"Prince-Elector\"&gt;Electors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Kings of Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor, and was once by &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; the family seat of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs\"&gt;Polish monarchs&lt;/a&gt;. The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its &lt;a href=\"baroque\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rococo\"&gt;rococo&lt;/a&gt; city centre. The controversial &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;American and British bombing of Dresden in World War II&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of the war killed approximately 25,000 people, many of whom were civilians, and destroyed the entire city centre. After the war, restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the historic inner city.\nSince &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, Dresden has again become a cultural, educational and political centre of Germany. The &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Dresden University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; is one of the 10 largest universities in Germany and part of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Universities%20Excellence%20Initiative\"&gt;German Universities Excellence Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The economy of Dresden and its agglomeration is one of the most dynamic in Germany and ranks first in Saxony. It is dominated by &lt;a href=\"High%20tech\"&gt;high-tech branches&lt;/a&gt;, often called \"&lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Saxony\"&gt;Silicon Saxony&lt;/a&gt;\". According to the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI) and &lt;a href=\"Berenberg%20Bank\"&gt;Berenberg Bank&lt;/a&gt;, in 2019, Dresden had the seventh best prospects for the future of all cities in Germany.\nDresden is one of the most visited cities in Germany with 4.7 million overnight stays per year. Its most prominent building is the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Frauenkirche\"&gt;Frauenkirche&lt;/a&gt; located at the &lt;a href=\"Neumarkt%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Neumarkt&lt;/a&gt;. Built in the 18th century, the church was destroyed during World War II. The remaining ruins were left for 50 years as a war memorial, before being rebuilt between 1994 and 2005. Other famous landmarks include the &lt;a href=\"Zwinger%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Zwinger&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Semperoper\"&gt;Semperoper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Castle\"&gt;Dresden Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the city is home to the renowned &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20State%20Art%20Collections\"&gt;Dresden State Art Collections&lt;/a&gt;, originating from the collections of the Saxon electors in the 16th century. Dresden's &lt;a href=\"Striezelmarkt\"&gt;Striezelmarkt&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20market\"&gt;Christmas market&lt;/a&gt;s in Germany and is considered the first genuine Christmas market in the world. Nearby sights include the National Park of &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20Switzerland\"&gt;Saxon Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Mountains\"&gt;Ore Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the countryside around &lt;a href=\"Elbe%20Valley\"&gt;Elbe Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moritzburg%20Castle\"&gt;Moritzburg Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAlthough Dresden is a relatively recent city of Germanic origin followed by settlement of &lt;a href=\"Polabian%20Slavs\"&gt;Slavic people&lt;/a&gt;, the area had been settled in the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; era by &lt;a href=\"Linear%20Pottery%20culture\"&gt;Linear Pottery culture&lt;/a&gt; tribes c. &lt;a href=\"8th%20millennium%20BC\"&gt;7500 BC&lt;/a&gt;. Dresden's founding and early growth is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Ostsiedlung\"&gt;eastward expansion of Germanic peoples&lt;/a&gt;, mining in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Mountains%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Ore Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Margraviate%20of%20Meissen\"&gt;Margraviate of Meissen&lt;/a&gt;. Its name etymologically derives from Old Sorbian \"Dre\u017e\u010fany\", meaning \"people of the forest\", from proto-Slavic \"*dr\u0119zga\" (dense forest) from \"*dr\u011bzg\u00e0\" (murky space). Dresden later evolved into the capital of &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history.\nAround the late 12th century, a &lt;a href=\"Sorbs\"&gt;Sorbian&lt;/a&gt; settlement called \"Dre\u017e\u010fany\" (meaning either \"woods\" or \"lowland forest-dweller\") had developed on the southern bank. Another settlement existed on the northern bank, but its Slavic name is unknown. It was known as \"Antiqua Dresdin\" by 1350, and later as Altendresden, both literally \"old Dresden\". &lt;a href=\"Dietrich%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Meissen\"&gt;Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen&lt;/a&gt;, chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place \"Civitas Dresdene\".\nAfter 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margraviate. It was given to Friedrich Clem after death of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Meissen\"&gt;Henry the Illustrious&lt;/a&gt; in 1288. It was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg\"&gt;Margraviate of Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1316 and was restored to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wettin\"&gt;Wettin&lt;/a&gt; dynasty after the death of &lt;a href=\"Waldemar%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Stendal\"&gt;Valdemar the Great&lt;/a&gt; in 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the dukes of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, and from 1547 the &lt;a href=\"Prince-elector\"&gt;electors&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nEarly-modern age.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rulers%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Elector&lt;/a&gt; and ruler of Saxony Frederick Augustus I became King &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Augustus II the Strong&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; in 1697. He gathered many of the best musicians, architects and painters from all over Europe to Dresden. His reign marked the beginning of Dresden's emergence as a leading European city for technology and art. During the reign of Kings Augustus II the Strong and &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20III%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Augustus III of Poland&lt;/a&gt; most of the city's &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; landmarks were built. These include the &lt;a href=\"Zwinger%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Zwinger Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Japanisches%20Palais\"&gt;Japanese Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Taschenbergpalais\"&gt;Taschenbergpalais&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pillnitz%20Castle\"&gt;Pillnitz Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the two landmark churches: the Catholic &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Cathedral\"&gt;Hofkirche&lt;/a&gt; and the Lutheran &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Frauenkirche\"&gt;Frauenkirche&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, significant art collections and museums were founded. Notable examples include the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Porcelain%20Collection\"&gt;Dresden Porcelain Collection&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kupferstich-Kabinett%2C%20Dresden\"&gt;Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%BCnes%20Gew%C3%B6lbe\"&gt;Gr\u00fcnes Gew\u00f6lbe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mathematisch-Physikalischer%20Salon\"&gt;Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1726 there was a riot for two days after a Protestant clergyman was killed by a soldier who had recently converted from Catholicism. In 1745, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Dresden\"&gt;Treaty of Dresden&lt;/a&gt; between Prussia, Saxony, and Austria ended the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Silesian%20War\"&gt;Second Silesian War&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few years later, Dresden suffered heavy destruction in the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1756\u20131763), following its capture by Prussian forces, its subsequent re-capture, and a failed &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dresden\"&gt;Prussian siege&lt;/a&gt; in 1760. &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schiller\"&gt;Friedrich Schiller&lt;/a&gt; completed his \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20to%20Joy\"&gt;Ode to Joy&lt;/a&gt;\" (the literary base of the &lt;a href=\"European%20anthem\"&gt;European anthem&lt;/a&gt;) in Dresden in 1785.\n19th and early 20th century.\nIn 1806, Dresden became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Kingdom of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; established by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; the French Emperor made it a &lt;a href=\"Headquarters\"&gt;base of operations&lt;/a&gt;, winning there the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dresden\"&gt;Battle of Dresden&lt;/a&gt; on 27 August 1813. As a result of the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Saxony became part of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt; in 1815. Following the Polish uprisings of &lt;a href=\"November%20Uprising\"&gt;1831&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Poland%20uprising%20%281848%29\"&gt;1848&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"January%20Uprising\"&gt;1863&lt;/a&gt; many Poles fled to Dresden, among others composer &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin&lt;/a&gt;. Dresden itself was a centre of the &lt;a href=\"German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349\"&gt;German Revolutions&lt;/a&gt; in 1848 with the &lt;a href=\"May%20Uprising%20in%20Dresden\"&gt;May Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, which cost human lives and damaged the historic town of Dresden. The uprising forced &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Augustus%20II%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Frederick Augustus II of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; to flee from Dresden, but he soon after regained control over the city with the help of Prussia. In 1852, the population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants, making it one of the biggest cities within the German Confederation.\nAs the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, Dresden became part of the newly founded &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1871. In the following years, the city became a major centre of economy, including &lt;a href=\"motor%20car\"&gt;motor car&lt;/a&gt; production, food processing, banking and the manufacture of &lt;a href=\"medical%20equipment\"&gt;medical equipment&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 20th century, Dresden was particularly well known for its camera works and its cigarette factories. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the city did not suffer any war damage, but lost many of its inhabitants. Between 1918 and 1934, Dresden was the capital of the first Free State of Saxony as well as a cultural and economic centre of the &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;Weimar Republic&lt;/a&gt;. The city was also a centre of European &lt;a href=\"modern%20art\"&gt;modern art&lt;/a&gt; until 1933.\nMilitary history.\nDuring the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a large military facility called &lt;a href=\"Albertstadt\"&gt;Albertstadt&lt;/a&gt; was built. It had a capacity of up to 20,000 &lt;a href=\"Soldier\"&gt;military personnel&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. The garrison saw only limited use between 1918 and 1934, but was then reactivated in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts usefulness was limited by attacks on &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;13\u201315 February&lt;/a&gt; and 17 April 1945, the former of which destroyed large areas of the city. However, the garrison itself was not specifically targeted. Soldiers had been deployed as late as March 1945 in the Albertstadt garrison.\nThe Albertstadt garrison became the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%201st%20Guards%20Tank%20Army\"&gt;Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Group%20of%20Soviet%20Forces%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Group of Soviet Forces in Germany&lt;/a&gt; after the war. Apart from the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army\"&gt;German army&lt;/a&gt; officers' school (\"Offizierschule des Heeres\"), there have been no more &lt;a href=\"military%20unit\"&gt;military unit&lt;/a&gt;s in Dresden since the army merger during German reunification, and the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1992. Nowadays, the Bundeswehr operates the &lt;a href=\"Milit%C3%A4rhistorisches%20Museum%20der%20Bundeswehr\"&gt;Military History Museum&lt;/a&gt; of the Federal Republic of Germany in the former Albertstadt garrison.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945, the Jewish community of Dresden was reduced from over 6,000 (7,100 people were persecuted as Jews) to 41, mostly as a result of emigration, but later also deportation and murder. Non-Jews were also targeted, and over 1,300 people were executed by the Nazis at the M\u00fcnchner Platz, a courthouse in Dresden, including labour leaders, undesirables, resistance fighters and anyone caught listening to foreign radio broadcasts. The bombing stopped prisoners who were busy digging a large hole into which an additional 4,000 prisoners were to be disposed of.\nDresden in the 20th century was a major communications hub and manufacturing centre with 127 factories and major workshops and was designated by the German military as a defensive strongpoint, with which to hinder the Soviet advance. Being the capital of the German state of &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, Dresden not only had garrisons but a whole \"military borough\", the \"Albertstadt\". This military complex, named after &lt;a href=\"Saxon\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; King Albert, was not specifically targeted in the &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;bombing of Dresden&lt;/a&gt;, though it was within the expected area of destruction and was extensively damaged.\nDuring the final months of the Second World War, Dresden harboured some 600,000 refugees, with a total population of . Dresden was attacked seven times between 1944 and 1945, and was &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20zone%20of%20Germany\"&gt;occupied by the Red Army after the German capitulation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;bombing of Dresden&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAF) and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; (USAAF) between 13 and 15 February 1945 was controversial. On the night of 13\u201314 February 1945, 773 RAF Lancaster bombers dropped 1,181.6 tons of incendiary bombs and 1,477.7 tons of high explosive bombs, targeting the rail yards at the centre of the city. The inner city of Dresden was largely destroyed. The high explosive bombs damaged buildings and exposed their wooden structures, while the incendiaries ignited them, denying their use by retreating German troops and refugees. Widely quoted Nazi propaganda reports claimed 200,000 deaths, but the German &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Historians%27%20Commission\"&gt;Dresden Historians' Commission&lt;/a&gt;, made up of 13 prominent German historians, in an official 2010 report published after five years of research concluded that casualties numbered between 18,000 and 25,000.\nThe Allies described the operation as the legitimate bombing of a military and industrial target. Several researchers have argued that the February attacks were &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28law%29%23International%20law\"&gt;disproportionate&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of inadequate Nazi air raid measures for refugees, mostly women and children died.\nAmerican author &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Vonnegut\"&gt;Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Slaughterhouse%20Five\"&gt;Slaughterhouse Five&lt;/a&gt;\" is loosely based on his first-hand experience of the raid as a &lt;a href=\"POW\"&gt;POW&lt;/a&gt;. In remembrance of the victims, the anniversaries of the bombing of Dresden are marked with peace demonstrations, devotions and marches.\nThe destruction of Dresden allowed &lt;a href=\"Hildebrand%20Gurlitt\"&gt;Hildebrand Gurlitt&lt;/a&gt;, a major Nazi museum director and art dealer, to hide &lt;a href=\"Gurlitt%20Collection\"&gt;a large collection of artwork&lt;/a&gt; worth over a billion dollars that had been stolen during the Nazi era, as he claimed it had been destroyed along with his house which was located in Dresden.\nPost-war.\nFollowing his military service the German press photographer and photojournalist &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Peter\"&gt;Richard Peter&lt;/a&gt; returned to Dresden and began to document the ruined city. Among his best known works \"Blick auf Dresden vom Rathausturm\" (\"View of Dresden from the Rathus Tower\"). It has become one of the best known photographs of a ruined post-war Germany following its appearance in 1949 in his book \"Dresden, eine Kamera klagt an\" (\"Dresden, a photographic accusation\", ).\nWhen a skeleton previously used as a model for drawing art classes was found in the ruins of the Dresden Art Academy the photographer &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Kesting\"&gt;Edmund Kesting&lt;/a&gt; with the assistance of Peter posed it in a number of different locations to produce a series of haunting photographic images to give the impression that Death was wandering through the city in search of the dead. Kesting subsequently published them in the book \"Dresdner Totentanz\" (\"Dresden\u2019s Death Dance\")\nThe damage from the Allied air raids was so bad that following the end of the Second World War a narrow gauge light railway system was constructed to remove the debris, though being makeshift there were frequent derailments. This railway system which had seven lines, employed 5,000 staff and 40 locomotives, all of which bore women\u2019s names. The last train remained in service until 1958, though the last official debris clearance team was only disbanded in 1977.\nRather than repair them the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; (former East Germany) authorities razed the ruins of many churches, royal buildings and palaces in the 1950s and 1960s, such as the Gothic &lt;a href=\"Sophienkirche\"&gt;Sophienkirche&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alberttheater\"&gt;Alberttheater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wackerbarth-Palais\"&gt;Wackerbarth-Palais&lt;/a&gt; as well as many historic residential buildings. The surroundings of the once lively Prager Stra\u00dfe resembled a wasteland before it was rebuilt in the socialist style at the beginning of the 1960s.\nHowever compared to &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of historic buildings were saved. Among them were the St\u00e4ndehaus (1946), the Augustusbr\u00fccke (1949), the Kreuzkirche (until 1955), the Zwinger (until 1963), the Catholic Court Church (until 1965), the Semperoper (until 1985), the Japanese Palace (until 1987) and the two largest train stations. Some of this work dragged on for decades often interrupted by the overall economic situation in the GDR. The ruins of the Frauenkirche were allowed to remain on Neumarkt as a memorial to the war.\nWhile the Theater and Schlo\u00dfplatz were rebuilt in accordance with the historical model in 1990, the Neumarkt remained completely undeveloped. On the other hand buildings of socialist classicism and spatial design and orientation according to socialist ideals (e.g. Kulturpalast) were built at the Altmarkt.\nFrom 1955 to 1958, a large part of the art treasures looted by the Soviet Union was returned, which meant that from 1960 onwards many state art collections could be opened in reconstructed facilities or interim exhibitions. Important orchestras such as the Staatskapelle performed in alternative venues (for example in the Kulturpalast from 1969). Some cultural institutions were moved out of the city center (for example the state library in Albertstadt). The Outer Neustadt, which was almost undamaged during the war was threatened with demolition in the 1980s following years of neglect, but was preserved following public protests.\nTo house the homeless large prefabricated housing estates were built on previously undeveloped land In Prohlis and Gorbitz. Damaged housing in the Johannstadt and other areas in the city center were demolished and replaced with large apartment blocks. The villa districts in Blasewitz, Striesen, Kleinzschachwitz, Loschwitz and on the Wei\u00dfen Hirsch were largely preserved.\nDresden became a major industrial centre in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; (former East Germany) with a great deal of research infrastructure. It was the centre of &lt;a href=\"Bezirk%20Dresden\"&gt;Bezirk Dresden&lt;/a&gt; (Dresden District) between 1952 and 1990. Many of the city's important historic buildings were reconstructed, including the &lt;a href=\"Semper%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Semper Opera House&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zwinger%20Palace\"&gt;Zwinger Palace&lt;/a&gt;, although the city leaders chose to rebuild large areas of the city in a \"socialist modern\" style, partly for economic reasons, but also to break away from the city's past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie.\nUntil the end of the Cold War, the 1st Armored Guard Army of the Soviet Army and the 7th Panzer Division of the National People's Army were stationed in and around Dresden. Following reunification in 1989, the Soviet / Russian troops were withdrawn from Germany in the early 1990s and the NVA dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the Two-Plus-Four Treaty of 1990.\nFrom 1985 to 1990, the future &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;President of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, was stationed in Dresden by the &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked for &lt;a href=\"Lazar%20Matveev\"&gt;Lazar Matveev&lt;/a&gt;, the senior &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; liaison officer there. On 3 October 1989 (the so-called \"battle of Dresden\"), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; passed through Dresden on its way to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;Federal Republic of Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Local activists and residents joined in the growing &lt;a href=\"civil%20disobedience\"&gt;civil disobedience&lt;/a&gt; movement spreading across the German Democratic Republic, by staging demonstrations and demanding the removal of the communist government.\nPost-reunification.\nDresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still bears many wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20bombing\"&gt;bombing raids&lt;/a&gt; of 1945, but it has undergone significant reconstruction in recent decades. Restoration of the Dresden Frauenkirche, a Lutheran church, the rebuilding of which was started after the reunification of Germany in 1994, was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden's 800th anniversary, notably by privately raised funds. The gold cross on the top of the church was funded officially by \"the British people and the House of Windsor\". The &lt;a href=\"urban%20renewal\"&gt;urban renewal&lt;/a&gt; process, which includes the reconstruction of the area around the &lt;a href=\"Neumarkt%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Neumarkt square&lt;/a&gt; on which the Frauenkirche is situated, will continue for many decades, but public and government interest remains high, and there are numerous large projects underway\u2014both historic reconstructions and modern plans\u2014that will continue the city's recent architectural renaissance.\nDresden remains a major cultural centre of historical memory, owing to the city's destruction in World War II. Each year on 13 February, the anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;British and American fire-bombing raid&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Since reunification, the ceremony has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone (after being used more politically during the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;). Beginning in 1999, right-wing &lt;a href=\"Neo-Nazi\"&gt;Neo-Nazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"White%20Nationalism\"&gt;white nationalist&lt;/a&gt; groups have organised demonstrations in Dresden that have been among the largest of their type in the post-war &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20Germany\"&gt;history of Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Each year around the anniversary of the city's destruction, people convene in the memory of those who died in the fire-bombing.\nThe completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the Neumarkt area. The areas around the square have been divided into 8 \"quarters\", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original. The quarters I, II, IV, V, VI and VIII have since been completed, with quarter III and quarter VII still partly under construction in 2020.\nIn 2002, torrential rains caused the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; to flood above its normal height, i.e., even higher than the old record height from 1845, damaging many landmarks (see &lt;a href=\"2002%20European%20floods\"&gt;2002 European floods&lt;/a&gt;). The destruction from this \"millennium flood\" is no longer visible, due to the speed of reconstruction.\nThe United Nations' cultural organization &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; declared the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Elbe%20Valley\"&gt;Dresden Elbe Valley&lt;/a&gt; to be a World Heritage Site in 2004. After being placed on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 2006, the city lost the title in June 2009, due to the construction of the \"&lt;a href=\"Waldschl%C3%B6%C3%9Fchenbr%C3%BCcke\"&gt;Waldschl\u00f6\u00dfchenbr\u00fccke&lt;/a&gt;\", making it only the second ever World Heritage Site to be removed from the register. UNESCO stated in 2006 that the bridge would destroy the cultural landscape. The city council's legal moves, meant to prevent the bridge from being built, failed.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nDresden lies on both banks of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Basin\"&gt;Dresden Basin&lt;/a&gt;, with the further reaches of the eastern &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Mountains%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Ore Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the south, the steep slope of the &lt;a href=\"Lusatia\"&gt;Lusatia&lt;/a&gt;n granitic crust to the north, and the &lt;a href=\"Elbe%20Sandstone%20Mountains\"&gt;Elbe Sandstone Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the east at an altitude of about . Triebenberg is the highest point in Dresden at .\nWith a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Baroque-style architecture and numerous world-renowned museums and art collections, Dresden has been called \"Elbflorenz\" (&lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; of the Elbe).\nThe incorporation of neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Types%20of%20rural%20communities\"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; over the past 60 years has made Dresden the fourth largest &lt;a href=\"Urban%20districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;urban district&lt;/a&gt; by area in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg and &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nearest German cities are &lt;a href=\"Chemnitz\"&gt;Chemnitz&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest and Berlin to the north. &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; (Czech Republic) is about to the south and &lt;a href=\"Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt; (Poland) to the east.\nNature.\nDresden is one of the greenest cities in all of Europe, with 62% of the city being green areas and forests. The &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Heath\"&gt;Dresden Heath&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dresdner Heide\") to the north is a forest in size. There are four &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt;s. The additional Special Conservation Areas cover . The protected gardens, parkways, parks and old graveyards host 110 natural monuments in the city. The &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Elbe%20Valley\"&gt;Dresden Elbe Valley&lt;/a&gt; is a former world heritage site which is focused on the conservation of the &lt;a href=\"cultural%20landscape\"&gt;cultural landscape&lt;/a&gt; in Dresden. One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows, which cross the city in a 20 kilometre swath. &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20Switzerland\"&gt;Saxon Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; is located south-east of the city.\nClimate.\nLike many places in the eastern parts of Germany, Dresden has an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfb\"), with significant continental influences due to its inland location. The summers are warm, averaging 19.0\u00a0\u00b0C (66.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in July. The winters are slightly colder than the German average, with a January average temperature of . The driest months are February, March and April, with precipitation of around . The wettest months are July and August, with more than per month.\nThe microclimate in the &lt;a href=\"Elbe%20valley\"&gt;Elbe valley&lt;/a&gt; differs from that on the slopes and in the higher areas, where the Dresden district &lt;a href=\"Klotzsche\"&gt;Klotzsche&lt;/a&gt;, at 227 metres &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;, hosts the Dresden &lt;a href=\"weather%20station\"&gt;weather station&lt;/a&gt;. The weather in Klotzsche is colder than in the &lt;a href=\"inner%20city\"&gt;inner city&lt;/a&gt; at 112 metres &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlood protection.\nBecause of its location on the banks of the Elbe, into which some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow, flood protection is important. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a flood plain. Two additional trenches, about 50 metres wide, have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe, by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like &lt;a href=\"detention%20basin\"&gt;detention basin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"water%20reservoir\"&gt;water reservoir&lt;/a&gt;s are almost all outside the &lt;a href=\"Urban%20area\"&gt;city area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wei%C3%9Feritz\"&gt;Wei\u00dferitz&lt;/a&gt;, normally a rather small river, suddenly ran directly into the main station of Dresden during the &lt;a href=\"2002%20European%20floods\"&gt;2002 European floods&lt;/a&gt;. This was largely because the river returned to its former route; it had been diverted so that a railway could run along the river bed.\nMany locations and areas need to be protected by walls and sheet pilings during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.\nCity structuring.\nDresden is a spacious city. Its boroughs differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, and the former suburbs with scattered housing. During the German Democratic Republic, many apartment blocks were built. The original parts of the city are almost all in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20wall\"&gt;city walls&lt;/a&gt;, the historic outskirts were built in the 18th and 19th century. They were planned and constructed on the orders of the Saxon monarchs and many of them are named after Saxon sovereigns (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Friedrichstadt%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Friedrichstadt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albertstadt\"&gt;Albertstadt&lt;/a&gt;). Dresden has been divided into ten boroughs called \"Stadtbezirk\" and nine former municipalities (\"Ortschaften\") which have been incorporated since 1990.\nDemographics.\nThe population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants in 1852, making it one of the first German cities after Hamburg and Berlin to reach that number. The population peaked at 649,252 in 1933, and dropped to 368,519 in 1945 because of World War II, during which large residential areas of the city were destroyed. After large incorporations and city restoration, the population grew to 522,532 again between 1946 and 1983.\nSince &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt;, demographic development has been very unsteady. The city has struggled with migration and suburbanisation. During the 1990s the population increased to 480,000 because of several incorporations, and decreased to 452,827 in 1998. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew quickly by more than 45,000 inhabitants (about 9.5%) due to a stabilised economy and re-urbanisation. Along with &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potsdam\"&gt;Potsdam&lt;/a&gt;, Dresden is one of the ten fastest-growing cities in Germany.\n the population of the city of Dresden was 557,075, the population of the Dresden agglomeration was 790,400 , and the population of the Dresden metropolitan area, which includes the neighbouring districts of &lt;a href=\"Mei%C3%9Fen%20%28district%29\"&gt;Mei\u00dfen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A4chsische%20Schweiz-Osterzgebirge\"&gt;S\u00e4chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bautzen%20%28district%29\"&gt;Bautzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6rlitz%20%28district%29\"&gt;G\u00f6rlitz&lt;/a&gt;, was 1,343,305.\nAs of 2018 about 50.0% of the population was female. the mean age of the population was 43 years, which is the lowest among the urban districts in Saxony. there were 67,841 people with a migration background (12.1% of the population, increased from 7.2% in 2010), and about two-thirds of these, 44,665 or about 8.0% of all Dresden citizens were foreigners. This percentage increased from 4.1% in 2010.\nGovernance.\nDresden is one of Germany's 16 political centres and the capital of Saxony. It has institutions of democratic local self-administration that are independent from the capital functions. Some local affairs of Dresden receive national attention.\nDresden hosted some international summits in recent years, such as the &lt;a href=\"Petersburg%20Dialogue\"&gt;Petersburg Dialogue&lt;/a&gt; between Russia and Germany, the European Union's &lt;a href=\"Interior%20minister\"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; conference and the &lt;a href=\"G8\"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; labour ministers conference.\nMayor and city council.\nThe &lt;a href=\"city%20council\"&gt;city council&lt;/a&gt; is the legislative branch of the city government. The council gives orders to the mayor () via resolutions and decrees, and thus also has some degree of executive power.\nThe first freely elected mayor after German reunification was &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Wagner%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Herbert Wagner&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Christian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2001. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. &lt;a href=\"Ingolf%20Ro%C3%9Fberg\"&gt;Ingolf Ro\u00dfberg&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Free Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (FDP) served from 2001 until 2008. He was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Helma%20Orosz\"&gt;Helma Orosz&lt;/a&gt; (CDU). Since 2015, the mayor has been &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Hilbert\"&gt;Dirk Hilbert&lt;/a&gt; (FDP). The most recent mayoral election was held on 7 June 2015, with a runoff held on 5 July, and the results were as follows:\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2| Candidate\n! rowspan=2| Party\n! colspan=2| First round\n! colspan=2| Second round\n!

The controlling &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Constitutional Court of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; is in Leipzig. The highest Saxon court in civil and &lt;a href=\"criminal%20law\"&gt;criminal law&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"Higher%20Regional%20Court%20of%20Dresden\"&gt;Higher Regional Court of Dresden&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the Saxon state authorities are located in Dresden. Dresden is home to the Regional Commission of the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20%28region%29\"&gt;Dresden Regierungsbezirk&lt;/a&gt;, which is a controlling authority for the Saxon Government. It has jurisdiction over eight &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rural%20districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;rural districts&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Urban%20districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;urban districts&lt;/a&gt; and the city of Dresden.\nLike many cities in Germany, Dresden is also home to a local court, has a trade corporation and a Chamber of Industry and Trade and many subsidiaries of federal agencies (such as the Federal Labour Office or the &lt;a href=\"Technisches%20Hilfswerk\"&gt;Federal Agency for Technical Relief&lt;/a&gt;). It hosts some divisions of the German Customs and &lt;a href=\"Wasser-%20und%20Schifffahrtsamt\"&gt;Waterways and Shipping Office&lt;/a&gt;.\nDresden is home to a military subdistrict command, but no longer has large military units as it did in the past. Dresden is the traditional location for &lt;a href=\"officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;army officer&lt;/a&gt; schooling in Germany, today carried out in the &lt;a href=\"Offizierschule%20des%20Heeres\"&gt;Offizierschule des Heeres&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocal affairs.\nLocal affairs in Dresden often centre around the &lt;a href=\"urban%20planning\"&gt;urban development&lt;/a&gt; of the city and its spaces. Architecture and the design of &lt;a href=\"public%20space\"&gt;public places&lt;/a&gt; is a controversial subject. Discussions about the &lt;a href=\"Waldschl%C3%B6%C3%9Fchenbr%C3%BCcke\"&gt;Waldschl\u00f6\u00dfchenbr\u00fccke&lt;/a&gt;, a bridge under construction across the Elbe, received international attention because of its position across the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Elbe%20Valley\"&gt;Dresden Elbe Valley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. The city held a public referendum in 2005 on whether to build the bridge, prior to UNESCO expressing doubts about the compatibility between bridge and heritage. Its construction caused loss of World Heritage site status in 2009.\nIn 2006, the city of Dresden sold its publicly &lt;a href=\"subsidized%20housing\"&gt;subsidized housing&lt;/a&gt; organization, WOBA Dresden GmbH, to the US-based private &lt;a href=\"investment%20company\"&gt;investment company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Investment%20Group\"&gt;Fortress Investment Group&lt;/a&gt;. The city received euro and paid off its remaining loans, making it the first large city in Germany to become debt-free. Opponents of the sale were concerned about Dresden's loss of control over the &lt;a href=\"subsidized%20housing\"&gt;subsidized housing market&lt;/a&gt;.\nDresden has been the center of groups and activities of far-right movements. Politicians and politics of &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20for%20Germany\"&gt;Alternative for Germany&lt;/a&gt; (AfD) have a strong backing. Starting in October 2014, &lt;a href=\"Pegida\"&gt;PEGIDA&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nationalistic\"&gt;nationalistic&lt;/a&gt; political movement based in Dresden has been organizing weekly demonstrations against what it perceives as the &lt;a href=\"Islamization\"&gt;Islamization&lt;/a&gt; of Europe at the height of the &lt;a href=\"European%20migrant%20crisis\"&gt;European migrant crisis&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of demonstrators increased to 15,000 in December 2014, so has the international media coverage of it. However, since 2015, the number of demonstrators has decreased significantly.\nIn 2019, the Dresden City Council passed a policy statement against \"anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, misanthropic and right-wing-extremist developments\". The motion was originally put forward by the satirical political party &lt;a href=\"Die%20Partei\"&gt;Die Partei&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BCndnis%2090/Die%20Gr%C3%BCnen\"&gt;B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Left%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Die Linke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;SPD&lt;/a&gt; and Die Partei voted in favour of the statement. The &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany\"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20for%20Germany\"&gt;AfD&lt;/a&gt; voted against it. Among other things, the statement calls on strengthening democracy, protecting human rights and raising spending on (political) education.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nDresden and &lt;a href=\"Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; became twins after the Second World War in an act of &lt;a href=\"Vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung\"&gt;reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;, as both had suffered near-total destruction from &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20bombing\"&gt;massive aerial bombing&lt;/a&gt;. Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned with the Dutch city of &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20Blitz\"&gt;Coventry Blitz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Blitz\"&gt;Rotterdam Blitz&lt;/a&gt; bombardments by the German &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; are also considered to be &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28law%29%23International%20law\"&gt;disproportional&lt;/a&gt;.\nDresden has had a triangular partnership with &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; since 1987. Dresden is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:\nFriendly cities.\nDresden also has friendly relations with:\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nAlthough Dresden is often said to be a &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Historicism%20%28art%29\"&gt;Historicism&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the contemporary styles of &lt;a href=\"Modernism\"&gt;Modernism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Postmodernism\"&gt;Postmodernism&lt;/a&gt;.\nDresden has some 13,000 listed cultural monuments and eight districts under general preservation orders.\nRoyal household.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Castle\"&gt;Dresden Castle&lt;/a&gt; was the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Household\"&gt;royal household&lt;/a&gt; from 1485. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Classicism\"&gt;Classicist&lt;/a&gt; styles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zwinger%20Palace\"&gt;Zwinger Palace&lt;/a&gt; is across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate by the moat is surmounted by a golden crown.\nOther royal buildings and ensembles:\nSacred buildings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Katholische%20Hofkirche\"&gt;Hofkirche&lt;/a&gt; was the church of the royal household. Augustus the Strong, who desired to be &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs\"&gt;King of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, converted to Catholicism, as Polish kings had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. Augustus the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, to establish a sign of Roman Catholic religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral \"Sanctissimae Trinitatis\" since 1980. The crypt of the &lt;a href=\"Wettin%20%28dynasty%29\"&gt;Wettin Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; is located within the church. King Augustus III of Poland is buried in the cathedral, as one of very few Polish Kings to be buried outside the &lt;a href=\"Wawel%20Cathedral\"&gt;Wawel Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn contrast to the Hofkirche, the Lutheran &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Frauenkirche\"&gt;Frauenkirche&lt;/a&gt; located at the &lt;a href=\"Neumarkt%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Neumarkt&lt;/a&gt; was built almost contemporaneously by the citizens of Dresden. The city's historic Kreuzkirche was reconsecrated in 1388.\nThere are also other churches in Dresden, for example the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"St.%20Simeon%20of%20the%20Wonderful%20Mountain%20Church\"&gt;St. Simeon of the Wonderful Mountain Church&lt;/a&gt; in the S\u00fcdvorstadt district.\nHistoricism.\n&lt;a href=\"Historicism%20%28art%29\"&gt;Historicist&lt;/a&gt; buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s.\nNotable examples of &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Revival\"&gt;Renaissance Revival&lt;/a&gt; architecture in Dresden include the &lt;a href=\"Albertinum\"&gt;Albertinum&lt;/a&gt; located at Br\u00fchl's Terrace as well as the &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20State%20Chancellery\"&gt;Saxon State Chancellery&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20State%20Ministry%20of%20Finance\"&gt;Saxon State Ministry of Finance&lt;/a&gt; located on the northern Elbe river banks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Rosa%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Villa Rosa&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1839 and was considered one of the most important villa buildings in Dresden, due to its &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Renaissance Revival architecture&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Yenidze\"&gt;Yenidze&lt;/a&gt; is a former cigarette factory building built in the style of a mosque between 1907 and 1909.\nThe most recent historicist buildings in Dresden date from the short era of &lt;a href=\"Stalinist%20architecture\"&gt;Stalinist architecture&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s, e.g. at the Altmarkt.\nModernism.\nThe \"Garden City of &lt;a href=\"Hellerau\"&gt;Hellerau&lt;/a&gt;\", at that time a suburb of Dresden, was founded in 1909. It was Germany's first &lt;a href=\"garden%20city%20movement\"&gt;garden city&lt;/a&gt;. In 1911, &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Tessenow\"&gt;Heinrich Tessenow&lt;/a&gt; built the &lt;a href=\"Festspielhaus%20Hellerau\"&gt;Hellerau Festspielhaus&lt;/a&gt; (festival theatre). Until the outbreak of World War I, Hellerau was a centre for European &lt;a href=\"modernism\"&gt;modernism&lt;/a&gt; with international standing. In 1950, Hellerau was incorporated into the city of Dresden. Today, the Hellerau reform architecture is recognized as exemplary. In the 1990s, the garden city of Hellerau became a &lt;a href=\"conservation%20area\"&gt;conservation area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"German%20Hygiene%20Museum\"&gt;German Hygiene Museum&lt;/a&gt; (built 1928\u20131930) is a signal example of &lt;a href=\"modern%20architecture\"&gt;modern architecture&lt;/a&gt; in Dresden in the interwar period. The building is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain fa\u00e7ades and simple structures.\nImportant modernist buildings erected between 1945 and 1990 are the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large &lt;a href=\"department%20store\"&gt;department store&lt;/a&gt;), representing the &lt;a href=\"international%20Style%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;international Style&lt;/a&gt;, and the multi-purpose hall &lt;a href=\"Kulturpalast%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Kulturpalast&lt;/a&gt;.\nContemporary architecture.\nAfter 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. Important contemporary buildings include the &lt;a href=\"New%20Synagogue%2C%20Dresden\"&gt;New Synagogue&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"postmodern%20architecture\"&gt;postmodern&lt;/a&gt; building with few windows, the &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Factory\"&gt;Transparent Factory&lt;/a&gt;, the Saxon State Parliament and the New Terrace, the UFA-Kristallpalast cinema by &lt;a href=\"Coop%20Himmelb%28l%29au\"&gt;Coop Himmelb(l)au&lt;/a&gt; (one of the biggest buildings of &lt;a href=\"Deconstructivism\"&gt;Deconstructivism&lt;/a&gt; in Germany), and the &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20State%20Library\"&gt;Saxon State Library&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Libeskind\"&gt;Daniel Libeskind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Foster%2C%20Baron%20Foster%20of%20Thames%20Bank\"&gt;Norman Foster&lt;/a&gt; both modified existing buildings. Foster roofed the main railway station with translucent Teflon-coated synthetics. Libeskind changed the whole structure of the &lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr%20Military%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Bundeswehr Military History Museum&lt;/a&gt; by placing a wedge through the historical arsenal building. According to Libeskind's studio, \"[t]he fa\u00e7ade\u2019s openness and transparency is intended to contrast with the opacity and rigidity of the existing building.\"\nBridges.\nImportant bridges crossing the Elbe river are the &lt;a href=\"Blaues%20Wunder\"&gt;Blaues Wunder&lt;/a&gt; bridge and the &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Bridge\"&gt;Augustus Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatues.\n&lt;a href=\"Jean-Joseph%20Vinache\"&gt;Jean-Joseph Vinache&lt;/a&gt;'s golden &lt;a href=\"equestrian%20statue\"&gt;equestrian statue&lt;/a&gt; of August the Strong, the \"Goldener Reiter\" (Golden Cavalier), is on the Neust\u00e4dter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstra\u00dfe (Main street) on his way to Warsaw, where he was King of Poland in personal union. Another statue is the memorial of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Frauenkirche.\nParks and gardens.\n&lt;a href=\"Gro%C3%9Fer%20Garten\"&gt;Gro\u00dfer Garten&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20garden\"&gt;Baroque garden&lt;/a&gt; in central Dresden. It includes the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Zoo\"&gt;Dresden Zoo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Botanischer%20Garten%20der%20Technischen%20Universit%C3%A4t%20Dresden\"&gt;Dresden Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Heath\"&gt;Dresden Heath&lt;/a&gt; is a large forest located in the northeast of Dresden and one of the city's most important recreation areas.\nThe park of &lt;a href=\"Pillnitz%20Palace\"&gt;Pillnitz Palace&lt;/a&gt; is famous for its botanical treasures, including a more than 230-year-old &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20camellia\"&gt;Japanese camellia&lt;/a&gt; and about 400 potted plants.\nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber\"&gt;Carl Maria von Weber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt; had a number of their works performed for the first time in Dresden. Other artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Ludwig%20Kirchner\"&gt;Ernst Ludwig Kirchner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Dix\"&gt;Otto Dix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oskar%20Kokoschka\"&gt;Oskar Kokoschka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Strauss\"&gt;Richard Strauss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Semper\"&gt;Gottfried Semper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gret%20Palucca\"&gt;Gret Palucca&lt;/a&gt;, were also active in the city. Dresden is also home to several art collections and musical ensembles.\nEntertainment.\nThe Saxon State Opera descends from the opera company of the former electors and Kings of Saxony. Their first opera house was the &lt;a href=\"Opernhaus%20am%20Taschenberg\"&gt;Opernhaus am Taschenberg&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1667. The &lt;a href=\"Opernhaus%20am%20Zwinger\"&gt;Opernhaus am Zwinger&lt;/a&gt; presented opera from 1719 to 1756, when the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt; began. The later &lt;a href=\"Semperoper\"&gt;Semperoper&lt;/a&gt; was completely destroyed during the bombing of Dresden during the second world war. The opera's reconstruction was completed exactly 40 years later, on 13 February 1985. Its musical ensemble is the \"&lt;a href=\"S%C3%A4chsische%20Staatskapelle%20Dresden\"&gt;S\u00e4chsische Staatskapelle Dresden&lt;/a&gt;\", founded in 1548. The &lt;a href=\"Staatsschauspiel%20Dresden\"&gt;Dresden State Theatre&lt;/a&gt; runs a number of smaller theatres. The Dresden State Operetta is the only independent &lt;a href=\"operetta\"&gt;operetta&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The \"Herkuleskeule\" (&lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"club%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;) is an important site in &lt;a href=\"Kabarett\"&gt;German-speaking political cabaret&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several choirs in Dresden, the best-known of which is the &lt;a href=\"Dresdner%20Kreuzchor\"&gt;Dresdner Kreuzchor&lt;/a&gt; (Choir of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20cross\"&gt;The Holy Cross&lt;/a&gt;). It is a boys' choir drawn from pupils of the &lt;a href=\"Kreuzschule\"&gt;Kreuzschule&lt;/a&gt;, and was founded in the 13th century. The \"Dresdner Kapellknaben\" are not related to the \"Staatskapelle\", but to the former \"Hofkapelle\", the Catholic cathedral, since 1980. The &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; is the orchestra of the city of Dresden.\nThroughout the summer, the outdoor concert series \"Zwingerkonzerte und Mehr\" is held in the &lt;a href=\"Zwinger%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;\"Zwingerhof\"&lt;/a&gt;. Performances include dance and music.\nThere are several small &lt;a href=\"cinemas\"&gt;cinemas&lt;/a&gt; presenting &lt;a href=\"cult%20film\"&gt;cult film&lt;/a&gt;s and low-budget or low-profile films chosen for their cultural value. Dresden also has a few multiplex cinemas, of which the Rundkino is the oldest.\nDresden's &lt;a href=\"Striezelmarkt\"&gt;Striezelmarkt&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20market\"&gt;Christmas market&lt;/a&gt;s in Germany. Founded as a one-day market in 1434, it is considered the first genuine Christmas market in the world.\nA big event each year in June is the &lt;a href=\"Bunte%20Republik%20Neustadt\"&gt;Bunte Republik Neustadt&lt;/a&gt;, a culture festival lasting three days in the city district of &lt;a href=\"Innere%20Neustadt%20%28Dresden%29\"&gt;Dresden-Neustadt&lt;/a&gt;. Bands play live concerts for free in the streets and there are refreshments and food.\nMuseums.\nDresden hosts the \"&lt;a href=\"Staatliche%20Kunstsammlungen%20Dresden\"&gt;Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden&lt;/a&gt;\" (Dresden State Art Collections) which, according to the institution's own statements, place it among the most important museums presently in existence. The art collections consist of twelve museums, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20Alte%20Meister\"&gt;Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister&lt;/a&gt;\" (Old Masters Gallery) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%BCnes%20Gew%C3%B6lbe\"&gt;Gr\u00fcnes Gew\u00f6lbe&lt;/a&gt;\" (Green Vault) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Palace\"&gt;Japanese Palace&lt;/a&gt;\" (Japanisches Palais). Also known are \"&lt;a href=\"Galerie%20Neue%20Meister\"&gt;Galerie Neue Meister&lt;/a&gt;\" (New Masters Gallery), \"&lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Armory\"&gt;R\u00fcstkammer&lt;/a&gt;\" (Armoury) with the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Armory%23Turkish%20Chamber\"&gt;Turkish Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Museum%20of%20Ethnology\"&gt;Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde Dresden&lt;/a&gt;\" (Museum of Ethnology).\nOther museums and collections owned by the Free State of Saxony in Dresden are:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20City%20Museum\"&gt;Dresden City Museum&lt;/a&gt; is run by the city of Dresden and focused on the city's history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr%20Military%20History%20Museum\"&gt;Bundeswehr Military History Museum&lt;/a&gt; is placed in the former garrison in the Albertstadt.\nThe book museum of the &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20State%20Library\"&gt;Saxon State Library&lt;/a&gt; presents the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Codex\"&gt;Dresden Codex&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kraszewski Museum is a museum dedicated to the most prolific &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Ignacy%20Kraszewski\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in Dresden from 1863 to 1883.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%204\"&gt;Bundesautobahn 4&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E40\"&gt;European route E40&lt;/a&gt;) crosses Dresden in the northwest from west to east. The &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2017\"&gt;Bundesautobahn 17&lt;/a&gt; leaves the A4 in a south-eastern direction. In Dresden it begins to cross the Ore Mountains towards Prague. The &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2013\"&gt;Bundesautobahn 13&lt;/a&gt; leaves from the three-point interchange \"Dresden-Nord\" and goes to Berlin. The A13 and the A17 are on the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E55\"&gt;European route E55&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, several &lt;a href=\"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Bundesstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;n (federal highways) run through Dresden.\nRail.\nThere are two main inter-city transit hubs in the railway network in Dresden: &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Dresden Hauptbahnhof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dresden-Neustadt%20railway%20station\"&gt;Dresden-Neustadt railway station&lt;/a&gt;. The most important railway lines run to Berlin, Prague, Leipzig and Chemnitz. A &lt;a href=\"Regional%20rail\"&gt;commuter train&lt;/a&gt; system (&lt;a href=\"Dresden%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Dresden S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt;) operates on three lines alongside the long-distance routes.\nAviation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Airport\"&gt;Dresden Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the city's &lt;a href=\"international%20airport\"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt;, located at the north-western outskirts of the city. After German reunification the airport's infrastructure has been considerably improved. In 1998, a motorway access route was opened. In March 2001, a new terminal building was opened along with the underground &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20S-Bahn\"&gt;S-Bahn station&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Flughafen%20station\"&gt;Dresden Flughafen&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-storey car park and a new aircraft handling ramp.\nTrams.\nDresden has a &lt;a href=\"Trams%20in%20Dresden\"&gt;large tramway network&lt;/a&gt; operated by &lt;a href=\"Dresdner%20Verkehrsbetriebe\"&gt;Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe&lt;/a&gt;, the municipal transport company. The Transport Authority operates twelve lines on a network. Many of the new &lt;a href=\"low%20floor\"&gt;low-floor&lt;/a&gt; vehicles are up to 45 metres long and produced by &lt;a href=\"Bombardier%20Transportation\"&gt;Bombardier Transportation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bautzen\"&gt;Bautzen&lt;/a&gt;. While about 30% of the system's lines are on &lt;a href=\"reserved%20track\"&gt;reserved track&lt;/a&gt; (often sown with grass to avoid noise), many tracks still run on the streets, especially in the inner city.\nThe &lt;a href=\"CarGoTram\"&gt;CarGoTram&lt;/a&gt; is a tram that supplies Volkswagen's &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Factory\"&gt;Transparent Factory&lt;/a&gt;, crossing the city. The transparent factory is located not far from the city centre next to the city's largest park.\nThe districts of Loschwitz and Weisser Hirsch are connected by the &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Funicular%20Railway\"&gt;Dresden Funicular Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which has been carrying passengers back and forth since 1895.\nEconomy.\nUntil enterprises like &lt;a href=\"Dresdner%20Bank\"&gt;Dresdner Bank&lt;/a&gt; left Dresden in the communist era to avoid &lt;a href=\"nationalisation\"&gt;nationalisation&lt;/a&gt;, Dresden was one of the most important German cities, an important industrial centre of the German Democratic Republic. The period of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;GDR&lt;/a&gt; until 1990 was characterized by low economic growth in comparison to western German cities. \nIn 1990 Dresden had to struggle with the &lt;a href=\"economic%20collapse\"&gt;economic collapse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and the other export markets in Eastern Europe. After reunification enterprises and production sites broke down almost completely as they entered the &lt;a href=\"social%20market%20economy\"&gt;social market economy&lt;/a&gt;, facing competition from the Federal Republic of Germany. After 1990 a completely new &lt;a href=\"legal%20system\"&gt;legal system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt; system was introduced and infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany. Dresden as a major urban centre has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former German Democratic Republic.\nBetween 1990 and 2010 the &lt;a href=\"unemployment\"&gt;unemployment rate&lt;/a&gt; fluctuated between 13% and 15%, but has decreased significantly ever since. In December 2019 the unemployment rate was 5.3%, the fourth lowest among the 15 largest cities of Germany (after &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;). In 2017, the &lt;a href=\"Gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;GDP per capita&lt;/a&gt; of Dresden was 39,134 euros, the highest in Saxony.\nThanks to the presence of public administration centres, a high density of semi-public research institutes and an extension of publicly funded high technology sectors, the proportion of highly qualified workers Dresden is again among the highest in Germany and by European criteria.\nIn 2019, Dresden had the seventh-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, after being ranked fourth in 2017. According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Dresden is one of the most dynamic regions in Germany. It ranks at number 41 of all 401 German regions and second of all regions in former East Germany (only surpassed by &lt;a href=\"Jena\"&gt;Jena&lt;/a&gt;).\nEnterprises.\nThree major sectors dominate Dresden's economy:\n&lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Saxony\"&gt;Silicon Saxony&lt;/a&gt; Saxony's semiconductor industry was built up in 1969. Major enterprises today include &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Micro%20Devices\"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;'s semiconductor fabrication spin-off &lt;a href=\"GlobalFoundries\"&gt;GlobalFoundries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infineon%20Technologies\"&gt;Infineon Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ZMDI\"&gt;ZMDI&lt;/a&gt; and Toppan Photomasks. Their factories attract many suppliers of material and cleanroom technology enterprises to Dresden.\nThe pharmaceutical sector developed at the end of the 19th century. The 'S\u00e4chsisches Serumwerk Dresden' (Saxon Serum Plant, Dresden), owned by &lt;a href=\"GlaxoSmithKline\"&gt;GlaxoSmithKline&lt;/a&gt;, is a global leader in &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; production. Another traditional pharmaceuticals producer is Arzneimittelwerke Dresden (Pharmaceutical Works, Dresden).\nA third traditional branch is that of mechanical and &lt;a href=\"electrical%20engineering\"&gt;electrical engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Major employers are the &lt;a href=\"Volkswagen\"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Factory\"&gt;Transparent Factory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elbe%20Flugzeugwerke\"&gt;Elbe Flugzeugwerke&lt;/a&gt; (Elbe Aircraft Works), &lt;a href=\"Siemens%20AG\"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Linde%20Group\"&gt;Linde-KCA-Dresden&lt;/a&gt;. The tourism industry enjoys high revenue and supports many employees. There are around one hundred bigger hotels in Dresden, many of which cater in the upscale range. Dresden still has a shortage of corporate headquarters.\nMedia.\nThe media in Dresden include two major newspapers of regional record: the \"&lt;a href=\"S%C3%A4chsische%20Zeitung\"&gt;S\u00e4chsische Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Saxon Newspaper\", circulation around 228,000) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Dresdner%20Neueste%20Nachrichten\"&gt;Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Dresden's Latest News\", circulation around 50,000). Dresden has a broadcasting centre belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Mitteldeutscher%20Rundfunk\"&gt;Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Dresdner Druck- und Verlagshaus\" (Dresden printing plant and publishing house) produces part of &lt;a href=\"Der%20Spiegel\"&gt;Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"print%20run\"&gt;print run&lt;/a&gt;, amongst other newspapers and magazines.\nEducation and science.\nUniversities.\nDresden is home to a number of renowned universities, but among German cities it is a more recent location for academic education.\nOther universities include the \"Hochschule f\u00fcr Kirchenmusik\", a school specialising in &lt;a href=\"Christian%20music\"&gt;church music&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Evangelische Hochschule f\u00fcr Sozialarbeit\", an education institution for &lt;a href=\"social%20work\"&gt;social work&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Dresden International University\" is a private postgraduate university, founded in 2003 in cooperation with the Dresden University of Technology.\nResearch institutes.\nDresden hosts many &lt;a href=\"research%20institute\"&gt;research institute&lt;/a&gt;s, some of which have gained an international standing. The domains of most importance are micro- and nanoelectronics, transport and infrastructure systems, material and photonic technology, and bio-engineering. The institutes are well connected among one other as well as with the academic education institutions.\n&lt;a href=\"Helmholtz-Zentrum%20Dresden-Rossendorf\"&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf&lt;/a&gt; is the largest complex of research facilities in Dresden, a short distance outside the urban areas. It focuses on &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20medicine\"&gt;nuclear medicine&lt;/a&gt; and physics. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Helmholtz%20Association%20of%20German%20Research%20Centres\"&gt;Helmholtz Association&lt;/a&gt; it is one of the German &lt;a href=\"Big%20Science\"&gt;Big Science&lt;/a&gt; research centres.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Max%20Planck%20Society\"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt; focuses on &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;fundamental research&lt;/a&gt;. There are three Max Planck Institutes (MPI) in Dresden: the &lt;a href=\"Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Molecular%20Cell%20Biology%20and%20Genetics\"&gt;MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Chemical%20Physics%20of%20Solids\"&gt;MPI for Chemical Physics of Solids&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20the%20Physics%20of%20Complex%20Systems\"&gt;MPI for the Physics of Complex Systems&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fraunhofer%20Society\"&gt;Fraunhofer Society&lt;/a&gt; hosts institutes of applied research that also offer mission-oriented research to enterprises. With eleven institutions or parts of institutes, Dresden is the largest location of the Fraunhofer Society worldwide. The Fraunhofer Society has become an important factor in location decisions and is seen as a useful part of the \"knowledge infrastructure\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz%20Scientific%20Community\"&gt;Leibniz Community&lt;/a&gt; is a union of institutes with science covering fundamental research and applied research. In Dresden there are three Leibniz Institutes. The &lt;a href=\"Leibniz%20Institute%20for%20Polymer%20Research\"&gt;Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leibniz%20Institute%20for%20Solid%20State%20and%20Materials%20Research\"&gt;Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research&lt;/a&gt; are both in the material and &lt;a href=\"high%20tech\"&gt;high-technology&lt;/a&gt; domain, while the Leibniz Institute for Ecological and Regional Development is focused on more fundamental research into urban planning. The Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf was member of the Leibniz Community until the end of 2010.\nHigher secondary education.\nDresden has more than 20 &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;gymnasia&lt;/a&gt; which prepare for a tertiary education, five of which are private. The \"S\u00e4chsisches Landesgymnasium f\u00fcr Musik\" with a focus on music is supported, as its name implies by the State of Saxony, rather than by the city.
