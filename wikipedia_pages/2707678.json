    "text": "Emilio Pujol Vilarrub\u00ed (or \"Emili\"; 10 September 1886 \u2013 21 November 1980) was a Spanish composer, guitarist and a leading teacher of the &lt;a href=\"classical%20guitar\"&gt;classical guitar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEmili Pujol was born in the little village of &lt;a href=\"Granadella\"&gt;Granadella&lt;/a&gt; just outside &lt;a href=\"Lleida\"&gt;Lleida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. He began his studies with &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20T%C3%A1rrega\"&gt;Francisco T\u00e1rrega&lt;/a&gt; in 1902, when he was sixteen years of age. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Llobet\"&gt;Miguel Llobet&lt;/a&gt; was making his debut as a concert artist outside &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. Pujol fondly remembered his first encounter with T\u00e1rrega and in his biography of his teacher, he described his \"mestre\" in very endearing, romantic terms.\nDuring the war years 1914\u20131918 he did not travel much and mainly remained in &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1918 he undertook his first tour of South America, starting in Buenos Aires. The only major interruptions in his concert travels were his marriage to Matilde Cuervas in Paris, an Andalusian flamenco guitarist, and the period of time he devoted to historical research in Paris into the instrumental predecessors of the guitar. During this period he partnered with the publisher &lt;a href=\"Max%20Eschig\"&gt;Max Eschig&lt;/a&gt; in publishing his \"Biblioth\u00e8que de musique ancienne et moderne pour guitare\" (from 1927), resulting in numerous works for solo guitar by historical and contemporary composers. The beginning signs of World War II also prevented him from continuing his concert career.\nFrom 1935 through 1940, Pujol continued giving a few concerts and lectures as well as pursuing his research in Spain, London and Paris. By 1941 he was back in Spain to the end of his life, and he started preparing the volume covering the composer for &lt;a href=\"vihuela\"&gt;vihuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20de%20Narv%C3%A1ez\"&gt;Luis de Narv\u00e1ez&lt;/a&gt;, for the series \"Monumentos de la Musica Espa\u00f1ola\" (vol. III). The volume was eventually followed by volumes covering &lt;a href=\"Alonso%20Mudarra\"&gt;Alonso Mudarra&lt;/a&gt; (1949) and Valderr\u00e1bano (1963). Prior to his death, Pujol had begun work on the largest of vihuela music books, the \"Orphenica Lyra\" by &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Fuenllana\"&gt;Miguel Fuenllana&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1554. He considered this book to be the pinnacle of the vihuela school and regarded Fuenllana as the final spokesman for this brief, courtly instrumental period in Spanish music.\nIn 1946, Pujol began his guitar classes at the &lt;a href=\"Lisbon%20Conservatory\"&gt;Lisbon Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; of Music, which continued through to 1969. During this period he was involved in giving master classes (in 1953 he was personally invited by &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9s%20Segovia\"&gt;Andr\u00e9s Segovia&lt;/a&gt; to give classes at the &lt;a href=\"Accademia%20Musicale%20Chigiana\"&gt;Accademia Musicale Chigiana&lt;/a&gt;) and adjudicating at guitar competitions. Also at this time, Pujol's first wife Matilde Cuervas died (1956). Seven years later he married Maria Adelaide Robert, a noted Portuguese pianist and singer who greatly assisted him in his final years.\nBeginning in the summer of 1965, Pujol launched his International Courses of Guitar, &lt;a href=\"Lute\"&gt;Lute&lt;/a&gt; and Vihuela in the city of Lleida, Spain. This event became quite popular and was attended by students and teachers from throughout the world. It was repeated every summer over a ten-year period, and in 1969 it was moved to the thirteenth-century village of Cervera.\nHis words on &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20T%C3%A1rrega\"&gt;T\u00e1rrega&lt;/a&gt;'s School of Guitar are also applicable to his own spirit, which constantly strived to \"resolving in advance all the problems, which can arise out of the diverse elements which contribute to the performance of a work: instrument, hands and spirit.\"\nOriginal compositions.\n124 original compositions (Joan Riera)\nEscuela Razonada de la Guitarra Vol I-IV\nTranscriptions.\n275 transcriptions (Juan Riera)\nGuitar duo.\n&lt;a href=\"Francis%20Poulenc\"&gt;Francis Poulenc&lt;/a&gt; (1899\u20131963).
