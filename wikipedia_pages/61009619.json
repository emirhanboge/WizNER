    "text": "The Bonaire National Marine Park or BNMP is the oldest &lt;a href=\"marine%20reserve\"&gt;marine reserve&lt;/a&gt; in the world. It includes the sea around &lt;a href=\"Bonaire\"&gt;Bonaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Klein%20Bonaire\"&gt;Klein Bonaire&lt;/a&gt; from the high water line to a depth of sixty meters. The park was established in 1979 and covers 2700 hectares (6700 acres) &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; - and &lt;a href=\"Mangrove\"&gt;mangrove vegetation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonaire%23Lac\"&gt;Lac&lt;/a&gt; is also part of the underwater park.\nIn 1999 the underwater park received the status of \" national park \" from the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20Antilles\"&gt;Netherlands Antilles&lt;/a&gt;. The uninhabited island &lt;a href=\"Klein%20Bonaire\"&gt;Klein Bonaire&lt;/a&gt; was added to the underwater park as a legally protected nature reserve in 2001. The west side of Bonaire is littered with &lt;a href=\"Recreational%20dive%20sites\"&gt;diving sites&lt;/a&gt; that are easily accessible from the beach. The dive sites around Klein Bonaire are accessible by boat for divers. With the exception of a small area, the BNMP is completely open to divers with a total of 86 public dive sites.\nGeography.\nThe national park covers the waters around Bonaire from the high water mark to a depth of 60 meters. Also some coastal stretches with &lt;a href=\"Mangrove\"&gt;mangrove forests&lt;/a&gt;, for example in the lagoon &lt;a href=\"Bonaire%23Environmental%20initiatives\"&gt;Lac&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the park is also the uninhabited island &lt;a href=\"Klein%20Bonaire\"&gt;Klein Bonaire&lt;/a&gt;. The national park also contains several important wetlands, which are particularly protected under the &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general Bonaire reef ecosystem has fewer &lt;a href=\"macroalgae\"&gt;macroalgae&lt;/a&gt;, a higher coral cover and more young corals per square metre than comparable reefs on &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20in%20Danger\"&gt;List of World Heritage in Danger&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Belize%20Barrier%20Reef%20Reserve%20System\"&gt;Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora and Fauna.\nOpen Water.\nThe flora and fauna of the open water off the coast of Bonaire are not well researched. The water, as typical of the region, is quite warm and contains few natural nutrients, but large quantities of &lt;a href=\"phytoplankton\"&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt; live in this area. Large fish occasionally observed in this area include &lt;a href=\"tuna\"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wahoo\"&gt;wahoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marlin\"&gt;marlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swordfish\"&gt;swordfish&lt;/a&gt;. Also &lt;a href=\"whale%20shark\"&gt;whale shark&lt;/a&gt;s have already been spotted in the waters.\nSeabed.\nAt the bottom of the Bonaire National Marine Park are extensive seagrass beds, which are of the seagrass species \"&lt;a href=\"Thalassia%20testudinum\"&gt;Thalassia testudinum&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Syringodium%20filiforme\"&gt;Syringodium filiforme&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"green%20algae\"&gt;green algae&lt;/a&gt; of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Halimeda\"&gt;Halimeda&lt;/a&gt;\" dominated. In the seagrass beds one can find a nursery for reef fish and a foraging ground for endangered queen conch and green turtles as well. For many species of fish they are important for the egg-laying and rearing of their young. In addition, large populations of &lt;a href=\"marine%20snail\"&gt;marine snail&lt;/a&gt;s, such as beautiful &lt;a href=\"flamingo%20tongue%20snail\"&gt;flamingo tongue snail&lt;/a&gt;s (\"\") live here.\nCoral Reefs.\nBonaire is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"fringing%20reef\"&gt;fringing reef&lt;/a&gt;s. These consist of about 60 different coral species, including &lt;a href=\"brain%20coral\"&gt;brain coral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elkhorn%20coral\"&gt;elkhorn coral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fire%20coral\"&gt;fire coral&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gorgonians\"&gt;gorgonians&lt;/a&gt;. The reefs offer a variety of marine life. Some of the most common fish species are &lt;a href=\"surgeonfish\"&gt;surgeonfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parrotfish\"&gt;parrotfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pomacentridae\"&gt;reefperch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wrasses\"&gt;wrasses&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, countless &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"shrimp\"&gt;shrimp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crayfish\"&gt;crayfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; live here. Bonaire's coral reefs were seriously damaged in 1999 by &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Lenny%23Central%20Caribbean\"&gt;hurricane Lenny&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, they are threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20issues%20with%20coral%20reefs%23Caribbean\"&gt;effects of pollutants and the warming of the sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nLac bay.\nIn the lagoon of Lac Bay is the only significant concentration of mangroves on Bonaire. Here grow &lt;a href=\"Red%20mangrove\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20mangrove\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"white%20mangrove\"&gt;white mangrove&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Conocarpus%20erectus\"&gt;button mangrove&lt;/a&gt;. The 700-acre lagoon has been a Ramsar site since the 1980s, offering habitat to &lt;a href=\"green%20sea%20turtle\"&gt;green sea turtle&lt;/a&gt; and other endangered species, such as &lt;a href=\"queen%20conch\"&gt;queen conch&lt;/a&gt; (\"\").\nTourism.\nAlready in 1939, the famous diving pioneer &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Hass\"&gt;Hans Hass&lt;/a&gt; visited Bonaire and reported in his books on the rich underwater world.\n Bonaire National Marine Park known as one of the hotspots for divers in the Caribbean and as one of the world's best places for snorkeling. For example, &lt;a href=\"Forbes%20magazine\"&gt;Forbes magazine&lt;/a&gt; ranked BNMP among the top 10 must-dive destinations in the world in 2017. \"In the Bonaire Marine Park, Dixon et al. (1994) found that most divers seldom venture further than 300 m in one direction and that there was a decreasing physical impact on reef communities with increasing distance from a mooring buoy. Analyzing coral cover, they estimate that the diver carrying capacity threshold for the Bonaire Marine Park is between 4000 and 6000 dives per site per year.\" In addition, various activities such as &lt;a href=\"kitesurfing\"&gt;kitesurfing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sailing\"&gt;sailing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"windsurfing\"&gt;windsurfing&lt;/a&gt; are offered in the area of the Bonaire National Marine Park. \nUnique to the Bonaire National Marine Park is that it runs entirely on its own income (without &lt;a href=\"subsidies\"&gt;subsidies&lt;/a&gt;). The income comes from an entrance fee for divers. Other users, such as swimmers, surfers, kite boarders, kayakers and water sports enthusiasts, pay a lower entrance fee. This also gives access to the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Slagbaai%20National%20Park\"&gt;Washington Slagbaai National Park&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to nature protection, the BNMP provides information about responsible diving to tourists and the maintenance of moorings (buoys) for boats with divers. The management is in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"STINAPA%20Bonaire\"&gt;Stichting Nationale Parken Bonaire&lt;/a&gt; (STINAPA) which also manages the Washington Slagbaai National Park."
