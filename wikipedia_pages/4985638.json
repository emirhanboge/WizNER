    "text": "Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle was an &lt;a href=\"indoor%20arena\"&gt;indoor sporting arena&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Prenzlauer%20Berg\"&gt;Prenzlauer Berg&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It was named after the executed Berlin &lt;a href=\"German%20resistance%20to%20Nazism\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; fighter &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Seelenbinder\"&gt;Werner Seelenbinder&lt;/a&gt;, a German &lt;a href=\"wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt; champion at several European championships and &lt;a href=\"1936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1936 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; athlete.\nThe arena opened in 1950 in what was then &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, in a converted hall that had been part of the central cattle market and slaughterhouse complex. It then hosted the first national meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Free%20German%20Youth\"&gt;Free German Youth&lt;/a&gt;. One of the major sports venues in Berlin in the 20th century, the capacity of the arena was up to 10,000 people.\nUntil the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Palast der Republik&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, East German mass organizations like the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Socialist Unity Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (SED) regularly used the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle as a convention hall. From 1970 to 1990 it was also the site of the annual &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Political%20Songs\"&gt;Festival of Political Songs&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 March 1988 &lt;a href=\"Depeche%20Mode\"&gt;Depeche Mode&lt;/a&gt; made their East German debut here, followed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wedding%20Present\"&gt;The Wedding Present&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Richman\"&gt;Jonathan Richman&lt;/a&gt; but also by &lt;a href=\"Feeling%20B\"&gt;Feeling B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Reiser\"&gt;Rio Reiser&lt;/a&gt; in the same year.\nWerner-Seelenbinder-Halle was closed and demolished in 1993. It was replaced by the present-day &lt;a href=\"Velodrom\"&gt;Velodrom&lt;/a&gt;."
