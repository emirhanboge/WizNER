    "text": "Russia competed at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;2014 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sochi\"&gt;Sochi&lt;/a&gt;, from 7 to 23 February 2014 as the host nation. As host, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; participated in all 15 sports, with a team consisting of 232 athletes. It is Russia's largest &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; team to date.\nIn preparation for the Games &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;Russian Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; naturalized a South Korean-born short-track speed-skater &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Hyun-soo\"&gt;Ahn Hyun-soo&lt;/a&gt; and an American-born snowboarder &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Wild\"&gt;Vic Wild&lt;/a&gt;. They won a total of 5 golds and 1 bronze in Sochi.\nRussia's medal count in 2014, 33 (before doping disqualifications), was its highest ever in the Winter Olympics, improving on the &lt;a href=\"Russia%20at%20the%201994%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1994 Games&lt;/a&gt;, when the Russian team earned 23 medals overall, also beating the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20at%20the%20Olympics\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;'s best medal count ever at the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20at%20the%201988%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nBobsledder &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Zubkov\"&gt;Aleksandr Zubkov&lt;/a&gt; was the flag bearer of the Russian team in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Winter%20Olympics%20Parade%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Parade of Nations&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Winter%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Games, it was discovered that Russia's performance has been aided by a &lt;a href=\"Doping%20in%20Russia\"&gt;wider state-sponsored doping program&lt;/a&gt;. On December 9, 2016 Canadian lawyer &lt;a href=\"Richard%20McLaren%20%28academic%29\"&gt;Richard McLaren&lt;/a&gt; published the second part of his &lt;a href=\"McLaren%20Report\"&gt;independent report&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up.\nAt the end of 2017, IOC disqualified 43 Russian athletes and stripped Russia from 13 Sochi medals, but &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt; nullified 28 out of 43 disqualifications citing insufficient evidence and returned 9 out of 13 medals. In particular, on November 1, 2017 cross-country skiers &lt;a href=\"Evgeniy%20Belov\"&gt;Evgeniy Belov&lt;/a&gt; and gold and silver medalist &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Legkov\"&gt;Alexander Legkov&lt;/a&gt; became the first athletes to be disqualified for doping violations after an investigation was completed. Four more were disqualified on November 9, 2017 when &lt;a href=\"Maksim%20Vylegzhanin\"&gt;Maksim Vylegzhanin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evgenia%20Shapovalova\"&gt;Evgenia Shapovalova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexei%20Petukhov\"&gt;Alexei Petukhov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Ivanova%20%28cross-country%20skier%29\"&gt;Julia Ivanova&lt;/a&gt; were sanctioned. The total was brought to ten when gold medalist &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Tretyakov%20%28skeleton%20racer%29\"&gt;Aleksandr Tretyakov&lt;/a&gt; and bronze medalist &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Nikitina\"&gt;Elena Nikitina&lt;/a&gt; were banned along with &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Orlova\"&gt;Maria Orlova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Potylitsina\"&gt;Olga Potylitsina&lt;/a&gt; who were all skeleton racers. On November 24, 2017 the IOC imposed life bans on bobsledder &lt;a href=\"Alexandr%20Zubkov\"&gt;Alexandr Zubkov&lt;/a&gt; and speed skater &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Fatkulina\"&gt;Olga Fatkulina&lt;/a&gt; who won a combined of 3 medals (2 gold, 1 silver). All their results were disqualified, meaning that Russia lost its first place in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Winter%20Olympics%20medal%20table\"&gt;medal standings&lt;/a&gt;. On November 27, 2017 IOC disqualified &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Vilukhina\"&gt;Olga Vilukhina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yana%20Romanova\"&gt;Yana Romanova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Chudinov\"&gt;Sergey Chudinov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexey%20Negodaylo\"&gt;Alexey Negodaylo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Trunenkov\"&gt;Dmitry Trunenkov&lt;/a&gt;, and stripped Vilyukhina and Romanova of their medals in biathlon. Three athletes who didn't win medals (&lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Kasjanov\"&gt;Alexander Kasjanov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ilvir%20Huzin\"&gt;Ilvir Huzin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aleksei%20Pushkarev\"&gt;Aleksei Pushkarev&lt;/a&gt;) were sanctioned on November 29, 2017. Biathlete &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Zaitseva\"&gt;Olga Zaitseva&lt;/a&gt; who won silver in a relay was disqualified on December 1, 2017. Two other athletes, &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%20Dotsenko\"&gt;Anastasia Dotsenko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yuliya%20Chekalyova\"&gt;Yuliya Chekalyova&lt;/a&gt;, were also banned. On December 12, 2017 six Russian ice hockey players were disqualified. On 18 December 2017 the IOC imposed a life ban on bobsledder &lt;a href=\"Alexey%20Voyevoda\"&gt;Alexey Voyevoda&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven athletes were disqualified on December 22, 2017. Among them, silver medalists &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Demchenko\"&gt;Albert Demchenko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tatiana%20Ivanova\"&gt;Tatiana Ivanova&lt;/a&gt; who were stripped of their medals in luge. On 1 February 2018, nine medals were returned after an appeal to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt;. On 24 September 2020, one more medal was returned after an appeal to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlpine skiing.\nAs a host nation, Russia has qualified a total quota of nine athletes in alpine skiing.\nBiathlon.\nBased on their performance at the &lt;a href=\"Biathlon%20World%20Championships%202012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Biathlon%20World%20Championships%202013\"&gt;2013 Biathlon World Championships&lt;/a&gt; Russia qualified 6 men and 6 women.

In November 2015, Russia's &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt; team was provisionally suspended by the &lt;a href=\"IAAF\"&gt;IAAF&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2016, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, &lt;a href=\"Grigory%20Rodchenkov\"&gt;Grigory Rodchenkov&lt;/a&gt;, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Security%20Service\"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.
