    "text": "This is a list of the bird species recorded in Greece. The avifauna of &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; included a total of 476 species according to the Hellenic Rarities Committee of the Hellenic Ornithological Society (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) with supplemental additions from Avibase as of August 2021. Of them, four have not been recorded since 1950 and 7 have been &lt;a href=\"Introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; by humans.\nThis list's &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Clements%20Checklist%20of%20Birds%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&lt;/a&gt;\", 2021 edition. \nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence. Species without tags are regularly occurring residents, migrants, or seasonal visitors which have been recorded since 1 January 1950.\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anatidae\"&gt;Anatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAnatidae includes the &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as &lt;a href=\"goose\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swan\"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.\nPheasants, grouse, and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phasianidae\"&gt;Phasianidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds.

Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.\nGrebes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Podicipediformes\"&gt;Podicipediformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Podicipedidae\"&gt;Podicipedidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grebe\"&gt;Grebe&lt;/a&gt;s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. \nPigeons and doves.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Columbiformes\"&gt;Columbiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;Columbidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pigeon\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dove\"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy &lt;a href=\"cere\"&gt;cere&lt;/a&gt;.\nSandgrouse.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pterocliformes\"&gt;Pterocliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pteroclidae\"&gt;Pteroclidae&lt;/a&gt;\nSandgrouse have small, pigeon like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk.

They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.\nSwifts.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Apodidae\"&gt;Apodidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\nRails, gallinules, and coots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;Rallidae&lt;/a&gt;\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crake\"&gt;crake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coot\"&gt;coot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gallinule\"&gt;gallinule&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\nCranes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Gruidae\"&gt;Gruidae&lt;/a&gt;\nCranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds.

They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. \nSandpipers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scolopacidae\"&gt;Scolopacidae&lt;/a&gt;\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the &lt;a href=\"sandpiper\"&gt;sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curlew\"&gt;curlew&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"godwit\"&gt;godwit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tringa\"&gt;shanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tattler%20%28bird%29\"&gt;tattler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodcock\"&gt;woodcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snipe\"&gt;snipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dowitcher\"&gt;dowitcher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phalarope\"&gt;phalarope&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. \nPratincoles and coursers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Glareolidae\"&gt;Glareolidae&lt;/a&gt;\nGlareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the &lt;a href=\"pratincole\"&gt;pratincole&lt;/a&gt;s, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the &lt;a href=\"courser\"&gt;courser&lt;/a&gt;s, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.\nSkuas and jaegers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Stercorariidae\"&gt;Stercorariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings.
