    "text": "The H\u00e4fele Group (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.hafele.com\"&gt;H\u00e4fele GmbH &amp; Co KG&lt;/a&gt;) is a German family enterprise with its head office in &lt;a href=\"Nagold\"&gt;Nagold, Germany&lt;/a&gt;. H\u00e4fele is the leading international manufacturer and supplier of furniture fittings and architectural hardware, with customers in more than 150 countries.\nH\u00e4fele's furniture fittings (&lt;a href=\"hinge\"&gt;hinge&lt;/a&gt;s, drawer systems, handles, connectors, ambient lighting), architectural &lt;a href=\"Builders%20hardware\"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; (door hardware and electronic locking systems), and other related fittings are specifically designed for the furniture, building, and hardware supply industries. H\u00e4fele manufactures a diverse range of products from &lt;a href=\"ironing%20board\"&gt;ironing board&lt;/a&gt;s to door closers.\nIn the 2016 &lt;a href=\"Fiscal%20year\"&gt;financial year&lt;/a&gt; the H\u00e4fele group had a turnover of 1.311 billion Euros with 37 subsidiaries in 6 continents. In 2017, the turnover grew to 1.375 billion Euros and reached 1.5 billion Euros in 2019. The turnover share abroad was 80%. The company has 8,100 employees worldwide.\nHistory.\nFoundation Phase.\nOn December the 1st of 1923, the merchant Adolf H\u00e4fele, together with Hermann Funk, founded the business \"Products of the hardware and tool industry\" in &lt;a href=\"Aulendorf\"&gt;Aulendorf&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour years later this became a sole proprietorship with H\u00e4fele as sole owner. A few months later, the company moved to Nagold, which was then the centre of &lt;a href=\"W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt; production.\nAt that time H\u00e4fele had three employees, customers were mainly carpentries in the surrounding area. In order to guarantee fast delivery, a &lt;a href=\"Wholesaling\"&gt;wholesale&lt;/a&gt; warehouse was set up.\nInternationalization.\nThe first exports to foreign countries were in 1933, in the same year the company was awarded the Golden Medal for the design of the exhibition stand at the &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt; Fair. Shortly before the end of the decade, the first furniture fittings catalogue appeared with a circulation of 20,000 copies, which was referred to as the \"World Globe Catalogue\" because of its title page.\nIn 1948, the Adolf H\u00e4fele company celebrated its 25th anniversary and the number of employees was 29. Four months later the company founder died. His nephew Walther Thierer took over the management. A major fire destroyed the administration and warehouse in 1950, and it was not until a year later that the company was able to move into its new premises.\nIn the following 30 years the company grew to up to 700 employees, with whom an annual turnover of over 150 million &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Mark\"&gt;DM&lt;/a&gt; was achieved, and expanded its sphere of activity to 120 countries. Sales subsidiaries were founded in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the company was distributed among four production companies in Germany.\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, computer-controlled shipping was introduced. At the beginning of the 70s, a dispatch center with a high-bay &lt;a href=\"warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; was built. By 1977, the area available for storage had doubled to 8,400 square meters; today, the company operates a central warehouse with over 50,000 items, some of which is fully automated.\nAfter the death of Walter Thierer in 1982, Hans Nock, until then export manager, took over the management of the company. Until 2003 he managed the company, which during this time grew to 2900 employees with a turnover of 534 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s, and the share of foreign business in this increased to around 70 percent.\nAs Hans Nock's successor, Sibylle Thierer has been the third generation of the family to run the company since 2003. According to the company, more than 160,000 customers are served in more than 150 countries.\nCatalog.\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Walther Thierer developed a reference book for furniture fittings with 25,000 articles based on the model of his uncle's \"World Globe Catalogue\". In 1971 \"Der Gro\u00dfe H\u00e4fele\" was published with a print run of 60,000 copies, followed two years later by editions in English, French and Spanish. A first catalogue for building and object fittings followed in 1981.\nProduction.\nH\u00e4fele produces fittings in four plants in Germany, since 1983 also furniture connectors sold under the brand name \"ixConnect\", and since 2009 also lift fittings branded \"Free\" and sliding door fittings under the brand \"Slido\".\nWith effect from 1 September 2009, H\u00e4fele GmbH &amp; Co KG together with Heinrich J. Kesseb\u00f6hmer KG took over the lift fittings and sliding door fittings divisions of Huwil Werke GmbH and a production facility in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; re-branding the operation \"FCC\" of \"Flap Competency Center\" and the product line \"Free\".\nCompany Structure.\nSales Offices.\nIn addition to the headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Nagold\"&gt;Nagold&lt;/a&gt;, there are ten sales offices in Germany.
