    "text": "Rosa gallica, the Gallic rose, French rose, or rose of Provins, is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the rose &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"native%20plant\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; to southern and central Europe eastwards to Turkey and the Caucasus. \"Rosa gallica\" was one of the first species of &lt;a href=\"rosa%20%28plant%29\"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt; to be cultivated in central Europe. It is a parent of several important &lt;a href=\"%23Cultivation\"&gt;cultivars&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Rosa gallica\" is a &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; forming large patches. The slender, straight &lt;a href=\"Thorns%2C%20spines%2C%20and%20prickles\"&gt;prickles&lt;/a&gt; are various in size and frequency in this species. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"pinnate\"&gt;pinnate&lt;/a&gt;ly-compound, with three to seven bluish-green leaflets. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are clustered one to four together, on glandular pedicels. Each flower has five or more petals, sometimes producing &lt;a href=\"double-flowered\"&gt;double corollas&lt;/a&gt;. The flowers are fragrant and deep pink. The &lt;a href=\"rose%20hip\"&gt;hips&lt;/a&gt; are globose to ovoid, 10\u201313\u00a0mm diameter, orange to brownish.\nGallica cultivar group.\nCultivars of the species \"R. gallica\" and hybrids close in appearance are considered as a &lt;a href=\"cultivar%20group\"&gt;cultivar group&lt;/a&gt;, the Gallica Group roses. Their exact ancestry is usually unknown and other species may be involved. They are easily cultivated. The Gallica Group roses share the vegetative characters of the species:\nApothecary's rose.\nPlants with semidouble deep pink flowers have been treated as either a variety, under the name \"R. gallica\" var. \"officinalis\", or as a &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;, \"R. gallica\" 'Officinalis'. It is also called the apothecary's rose, the crimson damask rose, or the &lt;a href=\"red%20rose%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;red rose of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"county%20flower\"&gt;county flower&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt; \"R. gallica\" var. \"officinalis\" 'Versicolor', with striped pink blooms, is also known as \"Rosa mundi\".\nThe names \"Rosa gallica\" f. \"trigintipetala\" or \"Rosa\" 'Trigintipetala' are considered to be synonyms of &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20%C3%97%20damascena\"&gt;\"Rosa\" \u00d7 \"damascena\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultivation.\nIt was cultivated by the Greek and Romans and commonly used in mediaeval gardens. Until the 19th century it was the most important species of rose to be cultivated, and most modern European rose cultivars have at least a small contribution from \"R. gallica\" in their ancestry.\n\"Rosa gallica\" is easily cultivated on well drained soil in full sun to semishade; it can survive temperatures down to \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe following cultivars and hybrids currently hold the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horticultural%20Society\"&gt;Royal Horticultural Society&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit%20roses\"&gt;Award of Garden Merit&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther notable cultivars include:"
