    "text": "Quassia amara, also known as amargo, bitter-ash, bitter-wood, or hombre grande (&lt;a href=\"spanish%20language\"&gt;spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"big man\") is a species in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Quassia\"&gt;Quassia&lt;/a&gt;\", with some &lt;a href=\"botanist\"&gt;botanist&lt;/a&gt;s treating it as the sole species in the genus. The genus was named by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; who named it after the first botanist to describe it: the &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;se &lt;a href=\"freedman\"&gt;freedman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Graman%20Quassi\"&gt;Graman Quassi&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Q. amara\" is used as insecticide, in traditional medicine and as additive in the food industry.\nName, image, harvested organ.\n\"Quassia\" (genus) \"amara\" (species) is an attractive small evergreen shrub or tree from the &lt;a href=\"tropics\"&gt;tropics&lt;/a&gt; and belongs to the family \"&lt;a href=\"Simaroubaceae\"&gt;Simaroubaceae&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Q. amara\" was named after called &lt;a href=\"Graman%20Quassi\"&gt;Graman Quassi&lt;/a&gt;, and enslaved healer and botanist who showed Europeans the plant's fever treating uses.\nThe name \"amara\" means \"bitter\" in Latin and describes its very bitter taste. \"Q. amara\" contents more than thirty &lt;a href=\"phytochemical\"&gt;phytochemical&lt;/a&gt;s with biological activities in its tissues including the very bitter compound &lt;a href=\"Quassinoid\"&gt;quassin&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it is used as insecticide, in traditional medicine against lot of disease and as bitter tasting additive in the food industry. All plant parts are useful for medicinal properties and the bark extracts are mainly used as flavoring in drinks but also for insecticides.\n\"Q. amara\" grows wild, but can be cultivated. Trunk wood, roots, bark, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds are harvested to gain extracts of the plant. For its beauty, \"quassia\" is also grown as &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Quassia amara\" is marketed and used interchangeably with another tree species \"&lt;a href=\"Picrasma%20excelsa\"&gt;Picrasma excelsa&lt;/a&gt;\", sharing the common name of \"quassia\" (and many of \"Quassia amara's\" constituents and uses). \"P. excelsa\" is with up to 25 m in height much taller, and occurs farther north in the tropics of Jamaica, the Caribbean, the Lesser Antilles, and northern Venezuela than \"Quassia amara\". Also in herbal medicine in the United States and Europe very little distinction is made between these two species of trees; they are used identically and just called \"quassia\".\nSynonyms.\n\"Quassia alatifolia, Q. officinalis, Q. amargo, Simaroube officinale\"\nCommon names.\nAmargo, Bitter ash, Bitterholz, Bitterwood, Bois amer, Bois de quassia, Crucete, Quassia, Cuassia, Cuachi, Fliegenholz, Guabo, Hombre grande, Jamaica bark, Kashshing, Marauba, Marupa, Palo muneco, Pau amarelo, Quassia amarga, Quassiawood, Ruda, Simaruba, Simarubabaum, Quassiaholz, Quassia de cayenne, Quassie, Quina, Simaba, Suriname wood\nMorphology, life form and growth.\nA small, multistemmed and slow growing tree with a disorderly growth twiggy limbs. It is a &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; or rarely a small &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, reaching a height up to 6 metres. The pinnate with 3-5 leaflets, deeply veined, polished alternated dark green leaves are 15\u201325\u00a0cm long and distinctive for their broadly winged axis and reddish veins. Leaf rachis are winged. Terminal red-branched racemes of &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt;s, 10\u201330\u00a0cm long, produces narrow, vivid crimson flowers, 2.5-3.5\u00a0cm long, that decorate the tips of each little limb. The flower comprises 5 lanceolate petals, which remain mostly closed together forming a sharpening cylinder. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are produced in a &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt; 15\u201325\u00a0cm long, each flower 2.5-3.5\u00a0cm long, bright red on the outside, and white inside. They are generally open for two days during the flowering period and each inflorescence presents on to four open flowers at once. The flowers are fragile and sometimes fall from the rachis at the slightest touch. The fruits, five small eliptic, fleshy, purple black drupes, 0.8-1.5\u00a0cm long, replace the flower and turn red as they mature. Every fruit contains one small seedling. All parts of \"Q. amara\" contain the bitter &lt;a href=\"Quassinoid\"&gt;Quassimarin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tree is predominately pollinated by &lt;a href=\"hummingbird\"&gt;hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;s but also self-compatible. Besides hummingbirds, other birds and \"&lt;a href=\"Trigona\"&gt;Trigona&lt;/a&gt;\" species from the \"&lt;a href=\"Apidae\"&gt;Apidea&lt;/a&gt;\" family do &lt;a href=\"pollination\"&gt;pollination&lt;/a&gt;. \nOrigin and regions of cultivation.\n\"Quassia amara\" is an understorey plant in neotropic rainforests and humid sites and mostly abundant in young forests. Therefore \"Q. amara\" is native in the tropics of Southern America. More exactly in the Caribbean (&lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tobago\"&gt;Tobago&lt;/a&gt;), Central America (&lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;), Northern South America (&lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana\"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;) and in Western South America (&lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;). It is found in the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20rainforest\"&gt;Amazon Rainforest&lt;/a&gt; at altitudes ranging from sea level to 900 m. \"Q. amara\" is traditionally harvested in natural forests. There are reports of cultivation in other countries of Central and South America. It inhabits zones of high precipitation (1500\u20134500\u00a0mm per year), and may appear in dry lands or in riparian lands where there is a high humidity permanent. \"Q. amara\" is widely planted outside its native range.\nSoil, climate and light requirements.\n\"Q. amara\" is suitable for medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. It prefers rich soils, that are water retentive. The tree can adapt to different pH-values in soils. It is a frost sensitive plant. Its salt toleration and dry toleration is low. It is classified as a semi-sciophyte with high tolerance to shade conditions but with a requirement of direct exposure to sunlight in order to complete its life cycle, in particular due to its effect on flower and fruit production. An increase in the light conditions increases flower and fruit production although it does not influence seed fertility. Therefore, its natural regeneration appears to be limited by light and interspecific competition with upperstorey forest species.\nChemical composition.\nIn the wood a share of 0.09 to 0.17% of &lt;a href=\"quassin\"&gt;quassin&lt;/a&gt; and 0.05 to 0.11% of neoquassin was detected in Costa Rician plants. &lt;a href=\"Quassin\"&gt;Quassin&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most bitter substances found in nature.\nOther identified components of bitterwood are: beta-carbolines, beta-sitostenone, &lt;a href=\"beta-sitosterol\"&gt;beta-sitosterol&lt;/a&gt;, dehydroquassins, &lt;a href=\"gallic%20acid\"&gt;gallic acid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gentisic%20acid\"&gt;gentisic acid&lt;/a&gt;, hydroxyquassins, isoparain, isoparaines, isoquassins, &lt;a href=\"malic%20acid\"&gt;malic acid&lt;/a&gt;, methylcanthins, methoxycanthins, methoxycantins, nigakilactone A, nor-neoquassin, parain, paraines, quassialactol, quassimarin, quassinol, quassol and simalikalactone D.\nUses.\nAdditive in food industry.\nThe bitter principle found in the bark and wood is used as the basis of &lt;a href=\"Angostura%20bitters\"&gt;Angostura Bitters&lt;/a&gt;, which is used as a flavouring in longdrinks, soft drinks, digestive tonics and also in gin-based drinks. It can be used as a substitute for hops in &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing or can be added to baked goods.\nMedicine.\nTraditionally, \"Q. amara\" is used as a digestive, to treat fever, and against hair parasites (&lt;a href=\"lice\"&gt;lice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flea\"&gt;flea&lt;/a&gt;s) and mosquito larvae in ponds (which has not proven harmful to fish populations).\nThe component Simalikalactone D was identified as an antimalarial. The preparation of a tea out of young leaves is used traditionally in &lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana\"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;. Experiments showed a high inhibition of \"&lt;a href=\"Plasmodium%20yoelii\"&gt;Plasmodium yoelii yoelii&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Plasmodium%20falciparum\"&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA 2012 study found a topical gel with 4% \"Quassia\" extract to be a safe and effective cure of &lt;a href=\"rosacea\"&gt;rosacea&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Quassia amara\" is part of the family of the &lt;a href=\"Simaroubaceae\"&gt;Simaroubaceae&lt;/a&gt;, which contains &lt;a href=\"quassinoid\"&gt;quassinoid&lt;/a&gt;s. Those are &lt;a href=\"secondary%20metabolite\"&gt;secondary metabolite&lt;/a&gt;s that have a large range of biological activities. The plant is known for the active principles that can be found in its &lt;a href=\"Bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt;. They have several different effects like increasing appetite, tonic, &lt;a href=\"diuretic\"&gt;diuretic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antipyretic\"&gt;febrifugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anthelmintic\"&gt;anthelmintic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antileukemic%20drug\"&gt;anti-leukemic&lt;/a&gt;. It also leads to more activity from the &lt;a href=\"Gallbladder\"&gt;gall bladder&lt;/a&gt; and has an effect against liver congestion. At external use, they act efficacy against parasites like &lt;a href=\"Pinworm%20infection\"&gt;pinworms.&lt;/a&gt; It is also a tribal remedy used in South America against &lt;a href=\"Debility%20%28medical%29\"&gt;debility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liver%20disease\"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt;, malaria, &lt;a href=\"snakebite\"&gt;snakebite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"back%20spasms\"&gt;back spasms&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Quassia amara\" is sold in the form of ground-up chips that are used to produce tonic or tinctures. Those are made by soaking the bark in the water for a long time.\nThere are two varieties of \"Q. amara\" that can be used in medicine. It is the West Indian type and the South American variety. The West Indian is high, it can reach 30.5m, the South American is much smaller, with a heigh from 5.5m.\nDiabetes.\nIn 2011 Husein and Gulam Mohammed, found that \"Q. amara\" extract reduced the elevated fasting blood &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; in rats. It also shows that glucose tolerance is increased by the consumption of \"Q. amara\". According to Ferreira and al. 2013, the wood powder of \"Q. amara\" shows an &lt;a href=\"Antihyperglycemic\"&gt;anti-hyperglycemic&lt;/a&gt; effect, similar to the one from &lt;a href=\"metformin\"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;. It could be helpful as an alternative therapy to the existing drugs that cause adverse health effects.\nMalaria.\nTea made with the leaves of the \"Q. amara\", is used against &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; in the traditional medicine of &lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana\"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves hexane from \"Q. amara\" was found to have high suppressive activity, at a concentration from 100\u00a0mg/kg body weight in mouse. In 2006, a study found that Simalikalactone D should be responsible for the antimalarial activity. In 2009, a new &lt;a href=\"quassinoid\"&gt;quassinoid&lt;/a&gt; was discovered, the simalikalactone E. This molecule inhibited the growth of \"&lt;a href=\"Plasmodium%20falciparum\"&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/a&gt;\" \"in vitro\" by 50%. The effect was mostly found in the &lt;a href=\"gametocyte\"&gt;gametocyte&lt;/a&gt;, which is the stage that is fundamental for the transmission to &lt;a href=\"mosquito\"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt;es. The tea from \"Quassia amara\" has also an effect on the red blood cells counts, the packed cell count, the packed cell volume and &lt;a href=\"hemoglobin\"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt; concentration. It has an &lt;a href=\"Anemia\"&gt;antianemic&lt;/a&gt; property.\nUlcers.\n\"Quassia amara\" is used in folk medicine from &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rica\"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;. Searchers from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ibadan\"&gt;University of Ibadan&lt;/a&gt; found a significant inhibition of the gastric ulceration induced by &lt;a href=\"Indometacin\"&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of protection was between 77% and 85%. It also reduces the total gastric acidity. It was related to an increase in gastric barrier &lt;a href=\"mucus\"&gt;mucus&lt;/a&gt; and non-protein sulfhydryl groups.\nAnti-leukemic.\nThe sap of \"Q. amara\" shows \"in vivo\" significant activity against &lt;a href=\"lymphocytic%20leukemia\"&gt;lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mouse\"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;.\nScalp problems.\nThe bitter substances from the \"Q. amara\" attack the &lt;a href=\"chitin\"&gt;chitin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Louse\"&gt;lice&lt;/a&gt; larvae and prevent the pupping of new larvae. It also reduce dandruff when used as a hair rinse\nSedative properties.\nThe \"Quassia amara\" bark extract has been shown to have a &lt;a href=\"sedative\"&gt;sedative&lt;/a&gt; and muscle relaxant effects.\nParallel medicines.\n\"Quassia amara\" is also used it this traditional Indian medicine, the &lt;a href=\"Ayurvedic%20medicine\"&gt;Ayurvedic medicine&lt;/a&gt; to treat &lt;a href=\"rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatism&lt;/a&gt;, alcoholism, &lt;a href=\"dandruff\"&gt;dandruff&lt;/a&gt;, stomach problems, and worms. It is also used in the homeopatic medicine.\nContraindication.\nExcessive use of this plant can cause &lt;a href=\"vomiting\"&gt;vomiting&lt;/a&gt;. It is also to avoid to use in the long term, because it can lead to a weakness of the vision, going to total &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;. It should also be avoided during &lt;a href=\"pregnancy\"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"menstruation\"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, because it may cause &lt;a href=\"Uterus\"&gt;uterine&lt;/a&gt; colic. It has also shown to have negative effects on the fertility of &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, both male and females. It has been proven to reduce the weight of &lt;a href=\"Testicle\"&gt;testis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"epididymis\"&gt;epididymis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"seminal%20vesicle\"&gt;seminal vesicle&lt;/a&gt; by the rats. They also found a reduction of the epididymal sperm count, the level of &lt;a href=\"testosterone\"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luteinizing%20hormone\"&gt;LH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Follicle-stimulating%20hormone\"&gt;FSH&lt;/a&gt;. These changes disappeared after some time. By the female rats, a decrease of the weight from the &lt;a href=\"ovary\"&gt;ovary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"uterus\"&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt; was seen. There was also a decrease in the &lt;a href=\"estrogen\"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; level. The litter number and weight were also reduced.\nInsecticide.\nInsecticidal extracts of the bark were first used in the USA 1850 and 1880 in Europe.\nExtracts of \"Quassia\" wood or bark act as a natural insecticide. For &lt;a href=\"organic%20farming\"&gt;organic farming&lt;/a&gt; this is of particular interest. A good protection was shown against different insect pests (e.g. &lt;a href=\"aphids\"&gt;aphids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20potato%20beetle\"&gt;Colorado potato beetle&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Anthonomus%20pomorum\"&gt;Anthonomus pomorum&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Rhagoletis%20cerasi\"&gt;Rhagoletis cerasi&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Caterpillar\"&gt;Caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;s of \"&lt;a href=\"Tortricidae\"&gt;Tortricidae&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Quassin\"&gt;Quassin&lt;/a&gt; extract works as a contact &lt;a href=\"insecticide\"&gt;insecticide&lt;/a&gt;. Adverse effects on &lt;a href=\"beneficial%20organism\"&gt;beneficial organism&lt;/a&gt;s were not found.\n\"Quassia amara\" extract can be obtained by boiling \"Q.amara\" chips in water and removing the wood chips afterwards. The extract contains &lt;a href=\"quassin\"&gt;quassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quassinoid\"&gt;neoquassin&lt;/a&gt;, which have insecticidal properties. The extract can be used to spray fruitlets, shortly after cease blooming. Insecticidal effects are comparable to the insecticide &lt;a href=\"diazinon\"&gt;diazinon&lt;/a&gt;. If the extract is sprayed before apple &lt;a href=\"sawfly\"&gt;sawfly&lt;/a&gt; larvae hatched, &lt;a href=\"Hoplocampa\"&gt;Hoplocampa&lt;/a&gt; infestation can be reduced with an efficacy of 50%. \"Q.amara\" extract in the dosage corresponding to 3-4.5\u00a0kg of \"Q. amara\" wood chips for 1/ha is optimal. The bitter wood can be dried after boiling and be reused 2 to 3 times. The extract of \"Q.amara\" can be storaged over half a year (e.g. spring till autumn).\n\"Q.amara\" is also used as a stomach or contact insecticide against various &lt;a href=\"aphid\"&gt;aphid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tortricidae\"&gt;moths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20potato%20beetle\"&gt;potato beetle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anthonomus%20pomorum\"&gt;apple blossom veevil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tephritidae\"&gt;thephtid fruit fly&lt;/a&gt;. \"Q.amara\" extract possesses antiparasitic, antibacterial, amoebacidial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed formulation is available for &lt;a href=\"organic%20farming\"&gt;organic farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotential effects on human health.\nLike any poorly studied alternative chemical applied to food crops, \"Quassia\" extract may have unknown health consequences. A study on rats in 1997 found that \"Quassia\" extract significantly reduced their fertility, reducing testes size, sperm quality and serum testosterone.\nFormulation.\nAround of \"Quassia\" wood chips are put together with of water. It is allowed to stand for 24 hours and then it is cooked for 30 min. It is then diluted with of water and used as a spray The use of approximately wood extract per hectare seems to be optimal to minimize the damage of \"&lt;a href=\"Hoplocampa%20testudinea\"&gt;Hoplocampa testudinea&lt;/a&gt;\" on apple trees.\nCultivation.\nSeeds and cuttings can be used for propagation of \"Q. amara\". Frost is not tolerated, but the plant is partially drought tolerant. A large amount of indirect light is recommended. As a tropical tree, \"Q. amara\" prefers a fertile, moist but well-drained soil in a partially shaded position. Although younger trees may tolerate greater or more direct light intensities, it is recommended for the agroecological cultivation of the plant's wood, to plant \"Q. amara\" in settings that offer large amounts of indirect light.\nCultivation management.\nThe older the plant, the greater the accumulation of &lt;a href=\"quassinoid\"&gt;quassinoid&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"xylem\"&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt;. Cultivation conditions, in the shade or in the sun, influences notably the amount of &lt;a href=\"quassin\"&gt;quassin&lt;/a&gt;e accumulated by the plants. This factor will have to be taken into account to achieve a good harvest. Controlled luminosity conditions favor plant growth and the concentration of &lt;a href=\"quassinoid\"&gt;quassinoid&lt;/a&gt;s in the tissues, which increases the quality of the raw material. Organic &lt;a href=\"fertilizer\"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt; such as deep or organic &lt;a href=\"mulch\"&gt;mulch&lt;/a&gt; can be used as nutritional compounds.\nReproduction.\nIn Costa Rica the flowering period of \"Q.amara\" arises between October and April, whereas in central Panama the flowering period occurs from October to January. The fruits ripen after two months. In February and early March, there is a peak of fruit ripening. The drupes show different colors during the ripening process. They turn from reddish to green until the reach a black color. The best &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt; results were obtained with seeds from drupes that are just before becoming totally black. Not only the color but also the size of the fruits are indicators for the viability of a &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits with a size between 1 and 1.5\u00a0cm are suitable for reproduction and they can be easily detached from the receptacle.\nThe treelet can be propagated sexual by seeds or asexual by vegetative cuttings of half-ripe wood. The trees can be cultivated in tree nurseries. Therefore seeds can be sowed of substrat such as sawdust, sand or soil. The &lt;a href=\"seedling\"&gt;seedling&lt;/a&gt;s are grown up for eight months until they reach a height around 40\u00a0cm. The &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt; occurs within 10 weeks. During the &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt; period daily watering is important. A distance of 10 x 15\u00a0cm at a density of 35 plants per m is recommended in tree nurseries.\nPests and diseases.\nCutting insects were found in &lt;a href=\"seedling\"&gt;seedling&lt;/a&gt;s, but no critical damage was observed. The fungus \"&lt;a href=\"Colletotrichum\"&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/a&gt; sp.\" caused &lt;a href=\"Canker\"&gt;anthracnosis&lt;/a&gt; in young plants, what leads to brown leaf changes surrounded by a yellowish halo, defoliation and suspension of plant growth. High soil moisture, inadequate soil drainage, high sowing density and bad weed control management are factors that enhances this fungal disease. It can be controlled with specific funigcides. Bacteria infection is scarce, but has to be taken into account during the transplantation."
