    "text": "York\u2013Dauphin station is an &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20transit\"&gt;elevated rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Market%E2%80%93Frankford%20Line\"&gt;Market\u2013Frankford Line&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"SEPTA\"&gt;SEPTA&lt;/a&gt; transit system. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Kensington%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. The station is located at the intersection of Dauphin, Jasper, and &lt;a href=\"Front%20Street%20%28Philadelphia%29\"&gt;Front Street&lt;/a&gt;s. it is the easternmost station running above Front Street; east of the station the line turns onto Kensington Avenue heading towards &lt;a href=\"Frankford%20Transportation%20Center\"&gt;Frankford&lt;/a&gt;.\nYork\u2013Dauphin is also a transfer point for &lt;a href=\"SEPTA%20City%20Bus\"&gt;SEPTA buses&lt;/a&gt;, serving routes &lt;a href=\"SEPTA%20Route%203\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SEPTA%20Route%2039\"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"SEPTA%20Route%2089\"&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nYork\u2013Dauphin is part of the Frankford Elevated section of the line, which began service on November 5, 1922.\nOn December 26, 1961, two cars were wrecked in a derailment at the York-Dauphin Station, killing one passenger. The accident occurred on the curve, at York and &lt;a href=\"Front%20Street%20%28Philadelphia%29\"&gt;Front Street&lt;/a&gt;, right before the York-Dauphin stop, just north of the station. The four-car southbound train went into a curve and hit a guardrail. The first three cars slid off the tracks as it crashed into York-Dauphin Station. The accident had occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Company\"&gt;Budd Company&lt;/a&gt;'s replacement of the original 315 Market\u2013Frankford Line cars with 270 new ones.\nBetween 1988 and 2003, SEPTA undertook a $493.3 million reconstruction of the Frankford Elevated. York\u2013Dauphin station was completely rebuilt on the site of the original station; the project included new platforms, elevators, windscreens, and overpasses, and the station now meets &lt;a href=\"Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990\"&gt;ADA accessibility&lt;/a&gt; requirements. The line had originally been built with &lt;a href=\"track%20ballast\"&gt;track ballast&lt;/a&gt; and was replaced with precast sections of &lt;a href=\"slab%20track\"&gt;slab track&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the station (and the entire line) to remain open throughout the project.\nDuring the Market\u2013Frankford's rush-hour &lt;a href=\"skip-stop\"&gt;skip-stop&lt;/a&gt; service pattern, York\u2013Dauphin was only served by \"B\" trains . This practice was discontinued on February 24, 2020.\nStation layout.\nThe station's entrance is on the south side of Dauphin Street, between Hope and Front streets. There is also an exit-only staircase from the eastbound platform to the southeast corner of York and Front streets."
