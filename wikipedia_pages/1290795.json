    "text": "Yucca pallida, sometimes called pale yucca, is a species of &lt;a href=\"yucca\"&gt;yucca&lt;/a&gt; native to Northern Mexico and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Blackland%20Prairie\"&gt;blackland prairie&lt;/a&gt;s of northern and central &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and notable for its light-colored &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; that range from a pale blue-gray to sage-green in color.\nThe rosettes average 20\u201350\u00a0cm tall and 30\u201380\u00a0cm in diameter, with leaves 15\u201340\u00a0cm long and 2\u20133\u00a0cm wide, being widest around the midpoint. The rosettes sit directly on the ground, with little or no trunk. The leaves have a yellow to brown terminal spine, and are generally flat, possibly with some waviness or rolling along the edges. The &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"panicle\"&gt;panicle&lt;/a&gt;, 1\u20132.5\u00a0m tall, with up to 100 bell-shaped &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, each 5\u20137\u00a0cm long, with color ranging from light green to cream.\n\"Yucca pallida\" is known to hybridize with \"&lt;a href=\"Yucca%20rupicola\"&gt;Yucca rupicola&lt;/a&gt;\" , which has a similar appearance, but whose leaves are more twisted and curved.\nAlthough not common in &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulture&lt;/a&gt;, its color, size, and moderate hardiness (down to \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C or 0\u00a0\u00b0F) make it a good gardening alternative to other species of yuccas."
