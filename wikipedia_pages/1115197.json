Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the Peddie Institute in honor of philanthropist and politician &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20B.%20Peddie\"&gt;Thomas B. Peddie&lt;/a&gt;, who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.\nPeddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to admit boys only. This was reversed in the early 1970s, and girls were readmitted. Today, the school is coeducational and non-denominational.\nIn 1993, former &lt;a href=\"Ambassador\"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Annenberg\"&gt;Walter Annenberg&lt;/a&gt; (Class of 1927) gave $100 million to Peddie, the largest donation ever made to a U.S. secondary school at the time.\nAs of 2018-19, the school's endowment stood at $344 million.\nAcademics.\nThe academic year is divided into three terms. The school offers &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Placement\"&gt;Advanced Placement&lt;/a&gt; (AP) courses in &lt;a href=\"AP%20Biology\"&gt;AP Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Chemistry\"&gt;AP Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Physics%20C\"&gt;AP Physics C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Environmental%20Science\"&gt;AP Environmental Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20European%20History\"&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20United%20States%20History\"&gt;AP United States History&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Government\"&gt;United States Government&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20French%20Language\"&gt;AP French Language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Spanish%20Language\"&gt;AP Spanish Language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Latin%20Literature\"&gt;AP Latin Literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Calculus%20AB\"&gt;AP Calculus AB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Calculus%20BC\"&gt;AP Calculus BC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Statistics\"&gt;AP Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Psychology\"&gt;AP Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Computer%20Science\"&gt;AP Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Art%20History\"&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Music%20Theory\"&gt;AP Music Theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AP%20Studio%20Art\"&gt;AP Studio Art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AP%20Chinese%20Language%20and%20Culture\"&gt;AP Chinese Language and Culture&lt;/a&gt;.
