    "text": "Joaquim Maria Puyal i Ortiga (born March 24, 1949) is a Spanish journalist known for his work in television and radio.\nBiography.\nHe was born on March 24, 1949 in the city of &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"philology\"&gt;philology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Universitat%20de%20Barcelona\"&gt;Universitat de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and later obtained a degree in Communication Sciences (\"Ci\u00e8ncies de la Comunicaci\u00f3\") from the &lt;a href=\"Universitat%20Aut%C3%B2noma%20de%20Barcelona\"&gt;Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010 he earned a &lt;a href=\"Ph.D.%20degree\"&gt;Ph.D. degree&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Linguistics\"&gt;Linguistics&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Universitat%20de%20Barcelona\"&gt;Universitat de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, defending an Extraordinary Awarded thesis.\nSince 1976 he has developed his career exclusively in the &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20language\"&gt;Catalan language&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the work of journalists could play a decisive role in the linguistic normalization of Catalan after forty years of repression in &lt;a href=\"Francoist%20Spain\"&gt;Francoist Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1997 he has oriented his work toward the Universitat de Barcelona and research in the area of communications theory.\nRadio career.\nIn 1967 he began to work with R\u00e0dio Barcelona, where he would remain, in various roles, until 1985. He began his work taking turns on FM radio, then a frequency in its initial stages. The director of the station, Manuel Tar\u00edn Iglesias, proposed that Puyal broadcast a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B3rdoba%20Club%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol\"&gt;C\u00f3rdoba Club de F\u00fatbol&lt;/a&gt;. Puyal went on to narrate more than 500 football matches in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; between 1968 and 1976. During this period he also broadcast &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; matches from the Gran Price and the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20dels%20Esports%20de%20Barcelona\"&gt;Palau dels Esports de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. For two years he was the Barcelona correspondent for \"Hora 25,\" led by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda.\nPioneer of Catalan-language radio.\nOn September 5, 1976 Puyal narrated the first Catalan-language broadcast of a football match since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Spanish%20Republic\"&gt;Second Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Games had been broadcast in Catalan prior to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, but when Puyal began presenting in Catalan he had to work with linguists to create the specialized vocabulary needed to analyze football. Puyal had made the proposal to broadcast games in Catalan to the general director of &lt;a href=\"Cadena%20SER\"&gt;Cadena SER&lt;/a&gt;, Manuel Ter\u00e1n, shortly after the death of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that it would be possible in the new environment of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy\"&gt;Spanish transition to democracy&lt;/a&gt;, even though Spain was not yet a &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Cadena SER approved the project to broadcast football in Catalan on FM radio and the new program \"Futbol en catal\u00e0\" was from the beginning supported by &lt;a href=\"La%20Caixa\"&gt;La Caixa&lt;/a&gt;, which paid for all its expenses. The program quickly attracted a large audience.\nIn 1985 Puyal left R\u00e0dio Barcelona and signed with &lt;a href=\"Catalunya%20R%C3%A0dio\"&gt;Catalunya R\u00e0dio&lt;/a&gt; with his entire team, including Antoni Bassas and Eduard Boet. Since then, and for more than two decades, he has narrated every official match played by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, for a total of more than 2,000 football matches during his career. All official FC Barcelona matches can be heard on \"La transmissi\u00f3 d'en Puyal\" on Catalunya R\u00e0dio.\nTelevision career.\nJoaquim Maria Puyal's popularity and prestige is due as much to his radio career as to his work in television. He has directed, produced and presented various programs, all in the Catalan language and briefly in the Spanish language.\nHe began his relationship with the small screen in the Miramar studios, on the Catalan circuit of &lt;a href=\"Televisi%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola\"&gt;Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola&lt;/a&gt;. He started out in 1977 presenting the program \"Vost\u00e8 Pregunta\" (\"You Ask\"), with a format then unprecedented in Spanish television. The program earned him the second &lt;a href=\"Premios%20Ondas\"&gt;Ondas Award&lt;/a&gt; of his career in 1979.\nApart from presenting his show in Catalan, he also hosted a number of programmes for national airing in Spanish, such as \"Memorias del Cine Espa\u00f1ol\" (\"Memories of Spanish Cinema\") (1978), \"Mano a mano\" (\"Hand in Hand\") (1981) and the first edition of the nightly talk show, \"Buenas Noches\" (\"Good Night\") (1982), with &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Mil%C3%A1\"&gt;Mercedes Mil\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. But after that first broadcast, he tendered his resignation, due to an alleged incompatibility with the performance of other activities.\nIn 1985, he signed with &lt;a href=\"Televisi%C3%B3%20de%20Catalunya\"&gt;Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya&lt;/a&gt; to direct and present, on TV3, the program \"Vost\u00e8 Jutja\" (\"You Judge\") which aired for two years. In 1989, he hosted the topical debate program \"La Vida en un xip\", which ran until 1992, and from 1993 to 1994 he presented \"Un tomb per la vida,\" a program in which he invited well-known people to talk about their lives. During this same time he directed three programs for TV3 for which he was not the presenter, \"Tres pics i repic\u00f3\", \"El joc del segle\" and \"L'indret de la mem\u00f2ria\".\nHe has been a mentor to notable Catalan journalists to whom he gave their first professional opportunity, including Antoni Bassas, Eduard Boet, &lt;a href=\"Pilar%20Calvo\"&gt;Pilar Calvo&lt;/a&gt;, Xavier Bosch, Marcel Gorgori, Manel Fuentes, Ricard Torquemada and M\u00f2nica Terribas.\nAwards and distinctions.\nHe has received four &lt;a href=\"Premios%20Ondas\"&gt;Ondas Awards&lt;/a&gt;, awarded by R\u00e0dio Barcelona of &lt;a href=\"Cadena%20SER\"&gt;Cadena SER&lt;/a&gt;\nIn addition, in 1993 Puyal was honored with the &lt;a href=\"Creu%20de%20Sant%20Jordi\"&gt;Creu de Sant Jordi&lt;/a&gt; and in 1997 with the Premi Nacional a la Projecci\u00f3 Social de la Llengua Catalana awarded by the &lt;a href=\"Generalitat%20of%20Catalonia\"&gt;Generalitat de Catalunya&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004 Puyal and his \"Futbol a Catalunya R\u00e0dio\" team were awarded the Generalitat's Premi Nacional de Radiodifusi\u00f3, Televisi\u00f3, Internet i Telecomunicacions in the radio broadcasting category. In 2005 he received the second annual &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20V%C3%A1zquez%20Montalb%C3%A1n\"&gt;Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; Prize for &lt;a href=\"sports%20journalism\"&gt;sports journalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has also been honored with the 1983 Premi Ciutat de Barcelona and three awards given by &lt;a href=\"%C3%92mnium%20Cultural\"&gt;\u00d2mnium Cultural&lt;/a&gt; (for \"Vost\u00e8 pregunta\" in 1983, \"Vost\u00e8 jutja\" in 1986 and \"Futbol en catal\u00e0\" in 1991). Puyal was recognized as the \"best radio announcer\" and \"best television presenter\" of the 20th century in a popular vote for the \"Els n\u00fameros 1 de les Comunicacions del segle XX\" conducted by the R\u00e0dio 4 and Eutelsat program \"L'Altra Radio.\"\nIn 2019 he was awarded by the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20University%20of%20Barcelona\"&gt;Autonomous University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; with a doctorate &lt;a href=\"honorary%20degree\"&gt;honorary degree&lt;/a&gt;."
