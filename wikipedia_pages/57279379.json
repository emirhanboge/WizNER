    "text": "The Madeira uprising, also referred to as the Island Revolt or the Revolt of the Deported, was a military uprising against the government of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Dictatorship\"&gt;National Dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; (1926\u20131933) that took place on the island of &lt;a href=\"Madeira%20Island\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in the early hours of 4 April 1931. On 8 April the rebellion spread to some islands of the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt; and, on 17 April, reached &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Guinea\"&gt;Portuguese Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. There were also attempts at military recruitment in Mozambique and on the island of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20Island\"&gt;S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, which failed early on. Military mutinies, planned for the continent, never occurred.\nThe rebellious military in the Azores, lacking popular support, surrendered soon without a fight, between 17 and 20 April 1931. In Madeira, where rebels had won popular support, taking advantage of the discontent generated by the government's restrictive economic policy to alleviate &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;the effects of the international crisis of 1929&lt;/a&gt;, the uprising was only neutralized on 2 May, with the arrival of a military expedition which crushed the revolting forces after seven days of fighting. Following the defeat of the uprising in Madeira on 6 May 1931, the rebels in Portuguese Guinea also surrendered."
