    "text": "Yesun Temur (\u0415\u0441\u04e9\u043d\u0442\u04e9\u043c\u04e9\u0440) was a &lt;a href=\"tengerism\"&gt;Tengric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1338\u20131342) of &lt;a href=\"Chagatai%20Khanate\"&gt;Chagatai Khanate&lt;/a&gt;. He was the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Changshi\"&gt;Changshi&lt;/a&gt; Khan. His name literally means \"Nine Iron\" in the &lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20language\"&gt;Mongolian language&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to take power, Yesun Temur is said to have poisoned (murdered) his brother. He regretted his action and blamed his mother for Changshi's death. His guilt caused him to become very stressed, which led to excessive drinking. He was overthrown by 'Ali-Sultan of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ogedei\"&gt;House of Ogedei&lt;/a&gt; in 1342."
