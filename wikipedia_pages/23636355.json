    "text": "Something Beginning With C is an album by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"The%20Exponents\"&gt;The Exponents&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1992. It reached number 1 and spent 19 weeks on the New Zealand Album Chart and went three times platinum. \nIt was the first album to be credited as the Exponents, rather than their former name &lt;a href=\"The%20Dance%20Exponents\"&gt;The Dance Exponents&lt;/a&gt;. It is the band's fourth studio album overall. \nIn May 2013, Universal Music re-released the album digitally in New Zealand in remastered standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition has thirteen additional tracks of B-sides and the original UK demo of \"&lt;a href=\"Why%20Does%20Love%20Do%20This%20To%20Me\"&gt;Why Does Love Do This To Me&lt;/a&gt;\". The album title was a play on the original plan of the band's to have the initials of their albums spell 'peace'. \"Something Beginning with C\" followed the albums &lt;a href=\"Prayers%20Be%20Answered\"&gt;Prayers Be Answered&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Expectations%20%28Dance%20Exponents%20album%29\"&gt;Expectations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amplifier%20%28Dance%20Exponents%20album%29\"&gt;Amplifier&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrack listing.\nAdditional tracks on the 2013 digital deluxe edition:"
