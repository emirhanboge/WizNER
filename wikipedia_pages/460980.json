    "text": "The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) () is the &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. It was established as a separate arm of the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Norwegian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; on 10 November 1944. The RNoAF's peacetime establishment is approximately 2,430 employees (officers, enlisted staff and civilians). 600 personnel also serve their draft period in the RNoAF. After &lt;a href=\"mobilization\"&gt;mobilization&lt;/a&gt; the RNoAF would consist of approximately 5,500 personnel.\nThe infrastructure of the RNoAF includes seven &lt;a href=\"airbase\"&gt;airbase&lt;/a&gt;s (at &lt;a href=\"%C3%98rland%20Main%20Air%20Station\"&gt;\u00d8rland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rygge%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Rygge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"And%C3%B8ya%20Air%20Station\"&gt;And\u00f8ya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evenes%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Evenes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bardufoss%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Bardufoss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bod%C3%B8%20Main%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Bod\u00f8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gardermoen%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Gardermoen&lt;/a&gt;), one control and reporting centre (at &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B8rreisa\"&gt;S\u00f8rreisa&lt;/a&gt;) and three training centres at V\u00e6rnes in &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;, Kjevik in &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt; and at KNM Harald Haarfagre/&lt;a href=\"Hafrsfjord\"&gt;Madlaleiren&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stavanger\"&gt;Stavanger&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nConception.\nMilitary flights started on 1 June 1912. The first plane, , was bought with money donated by the public and piloted by &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Dons\"&gt;Hans Dons&lt;/a&gt;, second in command of Norway's first &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; HNoMS \"Kobben\" (A-1). Until 1940 most of the aircraft belonging to the Navy and Army air forces were domestic designs or built under license agreements, the main bomber/scout aircraft of the Army air force being the Dutch-originated &lt;a href=\"Fokker%20C.V\"&gt;Fokker C.V&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War II.\nBuild-up for World War II.\nBefore 1944, the Air Force were divided into the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Army%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Norwegian Army Air Service&lt;/a&gt; (H\u00e6rens Flyvevaaben) and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Navy%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service&lt;/a&gt; (Marinens Flyvevaaben).\nIn the late 1930s, as war seemed imminent, more modern aircraft were bought from abroad, including twelve &lt;a href=\"Gloster%20Gladiator\"&gt;Gloster Gladiator&lt;/a&gt; fighters from the UK, and six &lt;a href=\"Heinkel%20He%20115\"&gt;Heinkel He 115&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Considerable orders for aircraft were placed with United States companies during the months prior to the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940.\nThe most important of the US orders were two orders for comparatively modern &lt;a href=\"P-36%20Hawk\"&gt;Curtiss P-36 Hawk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monoplane\"&gt;monoplane&lt;/a&gt; fighters. The first was for 24 Hawk 75A-6 (with 1200 &lt;a href=\"Horsepower\"&gt;hp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney\"&gt;Pratt &amp; Whitney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20R-1830%20Twin%20Wasp\"&gt;R-1830-SC3-G Twin Wasp&lt;/a&gt; engines), 19 of which were delivered before the invasion. Of these 19, though, none were operational when the attack came. A number were still in their shipping crates in Oslo harbour, while others stood at the &lt;a href=\"Kjeller\"&gt;Kjeller&lt;/a&gt; aircraft factory, flight ready, but none combat ready. Some of the Kjeller aircraft had not been fitted with machine guns, and those that had been fitted still lacked &lt;a href=\"gun%20sight\"&gt;gun sight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe ship with the last five 75A-6s that were bound for Norway was diverted to the United Kingdom, where they were taken over by &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAF). All 19 Norwegian P-36s that were captured by the German invaders were later sold by the German authorities to the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Air%20Force%23Continuation%20War%201941%E2%80%931944\"&gt;Finnish Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, which was to use them to good effect during the &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other order for P-36s was for 36 Hawk 75A-8 (with 1200\u00a0hp &lt;a href=\"Wright%20R-1820\"&gt;Wright R-1820&lt;/a&gt;-95 Cyclone 9 engines), none of which were delivered in time for the invasion, but were delivered to \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Norway\"&gt;Little Norway&lt;/a&gt;\" near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There they were used for training Norwegian pilots until the &lt;a href=\"USAAF\"&gt;USAAF&lt;/a&gt; took over the aircraft and used them under the designation P-36G.\nAlso ordered prior to the invasion were 24 &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20N-3PB\"&gt;Northrop N-3PB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"float%20plane\"&gt;float plane&lt;/a&gt;s built in on Norwegian specifications for a &lt;a href=\"patrol%20bomber\"&gt;patrol bomber&lt;/a&gt;. The order was made on 12 March 1940 in an effort to replace the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's obsolete MF.11 biplane patrol aircraft. None of the type were delivered by 9 April and when they became operational with the &lt;a href=\"No.%20330%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;330 (Norwegian) Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in May 1941 they were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; performing &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine\"&gt;anti-submarine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"convoy\"&gt;convoy&lt;/a&gt; escort duties.\nEscape and exile.\nThe unequal situation led to the rapid defeat of the Norwegian air forces, even though seven Gladiators from the fighter wing () defended &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Fornebu\"&gt;Fornebu airport&lt;/a&gt; against the attacking German forces with some success\u2014claiming two &lt;a href=\"Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110\"&gt;Bf 110&lt;/a&gt; heavy fighters, two &lt;a href=\"Heinkel%20He%20111\"&gt;He 111&lt;/a&gt; bombers and one &lt;a href=\"Junkers%20Ju%2052\"&gt;Junkers Ju 52&lt;/a&gt; transport. lost two Gladiators to ground &lt;a href=\"strafing\"&gt;strafing&lt;/a&gt; while they were rearming on Fornebu and one in the air, shot down by Future \"Experte\" &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Lent\"&gt;Helmut Lent&lt;/a&gt;, injuring the sergeant pilot. After the withdrawal of allied forces, the Norwegian Government ceased fighting in Norway and evacuated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on 10 June 1940.\nOnly aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service had the range to fly all the way from their last remaining bases in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Norway\"&gt;Northern Norway&lt;/a&gt; to the UK. Included amongst the Norwegian aircraft that reached the British Isles were four German-made Heinkel He 115 seaplane bombers, six of which were bought before the war and two more were captured from the Germans during the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Campaign\"&gt;Norwegian Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. One He 115 also escaped to Finland before the surrender of mainland Norway, as did three &lt;a href=\"Marinens%20Flyvebaatfabrikk%20M.F.11\"&gt;M.F. 11&lt;/a&gt;s; landing on Lake Salmij\u00e4rvi in &lt;a href=\"Pechengsky%20District\"&gt;Petsamo&lt;/a&gt;. A captured &lt;a href=\"Arado%20Ar%20196\"&gt;Arado Ar 196&lt;/a&gt; originating from the German &lt;a href=\"heavy%20cruiser\"&gt;heavy cruiser&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"German%20cruiser%20Admiral%20Hipper\"&gt;Admiral Hipper&lt;/a&gt;\" was also flown to Britain for testing.\nFor the Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft the only option for escape was Finland, where the planes would be interned but at least not fall into the hands of the Germans. In all two Fokker C.V.s and one &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth\"&gt;de Havilland Tiger Moth&lt;/a&gt; made it across the border and onto Finnish airfields just before the capitulation of mainland Norway. All navy and army aircraft that fled to Finland were pressed into service with the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Finnish Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, while most of the aircrew eventually ended up in \"Little Norway\".\nThe Army and Navy air services established themselves in Britain under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt;. Norwegian air and ground crews operated as part of the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, in both wholly Norwegian squadrons and also in other squadrons and units such as &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Ferry%20Command\"&gt;RAF Ferry Command&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Bomber%20Command\"&gt;RAF Bomber Command&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, Norwegian personnel operated two squadrons of &lt;a href=\"Supermarine%20Spitfire\"&gt;Supermarine Spitfire&lt;/a&gt;s: RAF 132 (Norwegian) Wing consisted of &lt;a href=\"No.%20331%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"No.%20332%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;RAF No. 332 (Norwegian) Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. Both planes and running costs were financed by the exiled Norwegian government.\nIn the autumn of 1940, a Norwegian training centre known as \"Little Norway\" was established next to &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bishop%20Toronto%20City%20Airport\"&gt;Toronto Island Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Canada.\nThe Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) was established by a &lt;a href=\"royal%20decree\"&gt;royal decree&lt;/a&gt; on 1 November 1944, thereby merging the Army and Navy air forces. No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron defended London from 1941 and was the highest scoring fighter &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20England\"&gt;South England&lt;/a&gt; during the war.\nUp until 8 May 1945, 335 persons had lost their lives while taking part in the efforts of the RNoAF.\nPost-war air force.\nAfter the war the Spitfire remained in service with the RNoAF into the fifties.\nIn 1947, the Surveillance and Control Division acquired its first radar system, and around the same time the RNoAF got its first &lt;a href=\"jet%20fighter\"&gt;jet fighter&lt;/a&gt;s in the form of &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Vampire\"&gt;de Havilland Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn 1949 Norway co-founded &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, and soon afterwards received American aircraft through the MAP (Military Aid Program). The expansion of the Air Force happened at a very rapid pace as the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; progressed. Throughout the Cold War the Norwegian Air Force was only one of two NATO air forces\u2014&lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; being the other\u2014with a responsibility for an area with a land border with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and Norwegian fighter aircraft had on average 500\u2013600 interceptions of Soviet aircraft each year.\nIn 1959, the &lt;a href=\"Anti-aircraft%20warfare\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Artillery&lt;/a&gt; was integrated into the Royal Norwegian Air Force.\nIn 1999, Norway participated with six F-16s during the &lt;a href=\"NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;NATO bombing of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\n21st century RNoAF.\nIn October 2002, a tri-national force of 18 Norwegian, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Danish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Netherlands%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; F-16 fighter-bombers, with one Dutch Air Force &lt;a href=\"KC-10\"&gt;KC-10&lt;/a&gt;A &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;tanker&lt;/a&gt;, flew to the &lt;a href=\"Manas%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Manas Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyrgyzstan\"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;, to support the NATO ground forces in &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom\"&gt;Operation Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. One of the missions was &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Desert%20Lion\"&gt;Operation Desert Lion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 27\u201328 January, Norwegian F-16s bombed &lt;a href=\"Hezb-e%20Islami%20Gulbuddin\"&gt;Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin&lt;/a&gt; Fighters in the Adi Ghar Mountains during the beginnings of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Mongoose%20%282003%29\"&gt;Operation Mongoose&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2004, four F-16s participated on NATO's &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Air%20Policing\"&gt;Baltic Air Policing&lt;/a&gt; operation.\nSince February, 2006, eight Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16s, joined by four Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16s, have been supporting NATO &lt;a href=\"International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force\"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; ground troops mostly in the southern provinces of Afghanistan. The air detachment is known as the 1st Netherlands-Norwegian European Participating Forces Expeditionary Air Wing (1 NLD/NOR EEAW).\n2010s.\nIn 2011, a detachment of F-16s were sent to enforce the &lt;a href=\"Libyan%20no-fly%20zone\"&gt;Libyan no-fly zone&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Gahr%20St%C3%B8re\"&gt;Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re&lt;/a&gt; condemned the violence against \"peaceful protesters in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen\", saying the protests \"are an expression of the people's desire for more participatory democracy. The authorities must respect fundamental human rights such as political, economic and social rights. It is now vital that all parties do their utmost to foster peaceful dialogue on reforms\". On 19 March 2011, the Norwegian government authorized the Royal Norwegian Air Force for deployment in &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. Norway approved six &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; fighters and personnel. The deployment started on 21 March and operated from the &lt;a href=\"Souda%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Souda Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Souda%20Bay\"&gt;Souda Bay&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 24 March 2011, F-16s from the Royal Norwegian Air Force were assigned to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Africa%20Command\"&gt;United States Africa Command&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn\"&gt;Operation Odyssey Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 March 2011, &lt;a href=\"laser-guided%20bombs\"&gt;laser-guided bombs&lt;/a&gt; were launched from F-16s of the Royal Norwegian Air Force against Libyan tanks and during the night towards 26 March an airfield was bombed. Forces were also deployed to &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Unified%20Protector\"&gt;Operation Unified Protector&lt;/a&gt; on 26 March 2011. \nBy July 2011, the Norwegian F-16's had dropped close to 600 bombs, some 17% of the total bombs dropped at that time. It was Norwegian F-16s that on the night towards 26 April, bombed Gaddafis headquarter in Tripoli.\nFrom September to December 2011, the Air Force contributed personnel and one P-3 Orion to &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Ocean%20Shield\"&gt;Operation Ocean Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Operating from the &lt;a href=\"Seychelles\"&gt;Seychelles&lt;/a&gt;, the aircraft searched for pirates in the Somali Basin.\nIn April 2016 the life of a patient, at the hospital in &lt;a href=\"Bod%C3%B8\"&gt;Bod\u00f8&lt;/a&gt;, was saved when specialised medical equipment was ferried halfway across Norway, in less than half an hour, by an Air Force F-16 jet from &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A6rnes%20Air%20Station\"&gt;V\u00e6rnes Air Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 29 March 2017, Norway signed a contract for five P-8As, to be delivered between 2022 and 2023.\nOn 3 November 2017, RNoAF took delivery of the first &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;F-35A Lightning II&lt;/a&gt;.\n2020s.\nIn March 2021, RNoAF participated in &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Air%20Policing\"&gt;Icelandic Air Policing&lt;/a&gt; with four &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II\"&gt;F-35A Lightning II&lt;/a&gt; and 130 military personnel.\nOn 2 December 2021, RNoAF announced that twelve F-16As have been sold to &lt;a href=\"Draken%20International\"&gt;Draken International&lt;/a&gt;. Transfer of the F-16As is expected to happen in 2022, pending formal approval by the US and Norwegian governments. In December 2021, Romania expressed their interest to purchase the rest of 32 F-16As.\nOn 6 January 2022, the F-35 officially took over the &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Reaction%20Alert\"&gt;Quick Reaction Alert&lt;/a&gt; mission, ending the F-16 fleet\u2019s 42 year-long mission.\nPlans.\nIn 2016, research was started to consider the Boeing P-8A Poseidon MMA to replace the aging six P-3C Orion and two Falcon 20 aircraft by 2020 - 2025. In November 2016 the intention to acquire five was confirmed. On 5 March 2018, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;United States Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; announced the award of a contract to Boeing that includes five P-8A Poseidons for RNoAF.\nOrganization.\nThe RNoAF is organized in five Air Wings. These are divided into a total of one Control and Reporting Centre, nine flying squadrons as well as two ground based air defense units. The former distinctiontion between a Main Air Station () and an Air Station () was replaced by a new distinction between an Air Force Station () and an Air Force Base ().\nAircraft.\nCurrent inventory.\nNote: Norway is part of several multi national services and has availability of using the services including three &lt;a href=\"C-17%20Globemaster%20III\"&gt;C-17 Globemaster III&lt;/a&gt;'s that are available through the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Airlift%20Wing\"&gt;Heavy Airlift Wing&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. Also access to &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A330%20MRTT\"&gt;Airbus A330 MRTT&lt;/a&gt; is available through the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet participation.\nRetired.\nPrevious aircraft flown by the Air Force included the &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre\"&gt;North American F-86K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F-84G\"&gt;Republic F-84&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter\"&gt;F-104 Starfighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20F-5\"&gt;Northrop F-5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20T-33\"&gt;Lockheed T-33&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20PT-26\"&gt;Fairchild PT-26&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina\"&gt;Catalina PB5Y-A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20C-47\"&gt;Douglas C-47&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-3%20Otter\"&gt;DHC-3 Otter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noorduyn%20Norseman\"&gt;Noorduyn Norseman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cessna%20O-1%20Bird%20Dog\"&gt;Cessna O-1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois\"&gt;Bell UH-1B&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bell%2047\"&gt;Bell 47G&lt;/a&gt; helicopter."
