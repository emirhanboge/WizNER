In the early years after independence it was a scene of fluctuating fortunes between the Congress and the Left wing parties, till the latter captured power in the late seventies. The &lt;a href=\"United%20News%20of%20India\"&gt;United News of India&lt;/a&gt; in a candid analysis says, \u201cThe green surge swept Bengal to demolish the red bastion in 2011 Assembly elections\u2026 Moreover, as the Left still remained cornered in state politics, their neutralised voters are increasingly migrating to the BJP for a viable alternative.\u201d\nElection results.\n2021.\n \n1977-2009.\nSubsequent to the resignation of the sitting MLA, Bilasibala Sahis, after her election to the Zilla Parishad (district council), Minu Bauri of CPI(M) won the Para seat in the 2009 by-elections defeating Charan Bauri of &lt;a href=\"Jharkhand%20Mukti%20Morcha\"&gt;JMM&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2006%20West%20Bengal%20state%20assembly%20election\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 2001, 1996 and 1991 Bilasibala Sahis of &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;CPI(M)&lt;/a&gt; won the Para assembly seat defeating her nearest rivals Sima Bauri of &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Trinamool%20Congress\"&gt;Trinamool Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Mira Bauri of Trinamool Congress, Gobordhan Bagdi of &lt;a href=\"Jharkhand%20Mukti%20Morcha\"&gt;JMM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durgadas%20Bauri\"&gt;Durgadas Bauri&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Contests in most years were multi cornered but only winners and runners are being mentioned. Gobinda Bauri of CPI(M) defeated Kashinath Bauri of Congress in 1987, and Sarat Das of Congress in 1982 and 1977.\n1951-1972.\nSarat Das of Congress won in 1972 and 1971. Tinkori Bouri of &lt;a href=\"Bangla%20Congress\"&gt;Bangla Congress&lt;/a&gt; won in 1969. S. Bauri of Bangla Congress won in 1967. Nepal Bauri of Congress won in &lt;a href=\"1962%20West%20Bengal%20state%20assembly%20election\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;. The Para seat did not exist in 1957. In &lt;a href=\"1952%20West%20Bengal%20state%20assembly%20election\"&gt;independent India's first election in 1951&lt;/a&gt;, the seat was entitled Para cum Chas.
