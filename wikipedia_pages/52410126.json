    "text": "Elizabeth Barnes is an American &lt;a href=\"philosopher\"&gt;philosopher&lt;/a&gt; working in &lt;a href=\"feminist%20philosophy\"&gt;feminist philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metaphysics\"&gt;metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20philosophy\"&gt;social philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethics\"&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt;. Barnes is a professor of philosophy at the Corcoran Department of Philosophy, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBarnes was born in &lt;a href=\"Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Asheville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and was raised around &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Barnes holds a bachelor's degree from the &lt;a href=\"Davidson%20College\"&gt;Davidson College&lt;/a&gt;, where she graduated \"&lt;a href=\"magna%20cum%20laude\"&gt;magna cum laude&lt;/a&gt;\", and a master's degree and PhD from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20St%20Andrews\"&gt;University of St Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, where she studied under Katherine Hawley and Daniel Nolan. After graduating from St Andrews, Barnes held posts in the philosophy department at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leeds\"&gt;University of Leeds&lt;/a&gt; from 2006, before joining the faculty at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. In 2012, she became editor-in-chief of the &lt;a href=\"academic%20journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; \"Philosophy Compass\".\nBarnes has published across various fields in philosophy, and edited a volume entitled \"Current Controversies in Metaphysics\", which was published with &lt;a href=\"Routledge\"&gt;Routledge&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. In 2016, her &lt;a href=\"monograph\"&gt;monograph&lt;/a&gt; \"The Minority Body\" was published with &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University%20Press\"&gt;Oxford University Press&lt;/a&gt;. In the book, Barnes challenges the view of &lt;a href=\"disability\"&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt; common in &lt;a href=\"analytic%20philosophy\"&gt;analytic philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, arguing instead that it is primarily a social phenomenon. Disabled persons, she argues, are not intrinsically worse off in virtue of being disabled, even though disability can be, in a restricted sense, a harm.\nPersonal life.\nShe is married to the Scottish philosopher Ross Cameron; the pair met at St Andrews, and Cameron is also a professor at Virginia."
