    "text": "10 Times Better (, 10VM), whose official name is Italy 10 Times Better, is a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Italy\"&gt;political party in Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n10 Times Better was founded in December 2017 by the Venetian entrepreneur, Andrea Dusi, to run in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Italian%20general%20election\"&gt;2018 general election&lt;/a&gt;; Dusi's aim is to create an Italian equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20%28Spanish%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Ciudadanos&lt;/a&gt;, the Spanish liberal party led by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Rivera\"&gt;Albert Rivera&lt;/a&gt;.\n10VM wants to restart investing funds on &lt;a href=\"Business\"&gt;enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"innovation\"&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt; which are considered the key points to re-launch Italy. Dusi often stressed that his party is completely the opposite of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Star%20Movement\"&gt;Five Star Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the anti-establishment party which some commentators have compared to 10VM.\nThe party's slogan is \"Italy Deserves to Be Ten Times Better\".\nIn July 2018 the founder Andrea Dusi decided to leave the political party to continue his activity as civic leader through Impactscool, a no profit organization aiming to prepare the youngests to the future.\nOn 18 April 2019 three Deputies joined the party. The party voted against the motion of confidence to the &lt;a href=\"Conte%20II%20Cabinet\"&gt;Conte II Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn September four deputies officially left &lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia%20%282013%29\"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; in order to join \"&lt;a href=\"Cambiamo%21\"&gt;Cambiamo!&lt;/a&gt;\". Along with a fifth deputy (Giorgio Silli), they renamed the \"Dream Italy\u201310 Times Better\" sub-group within the &lt;a href=\"Mixed%20Group\"&gt;Mixed Group&lt;/a&gt; as \"Cambiamo!\u201310 Times Better\".\nElection results.\nIn the political election of the 4th of March, 10VM obtained 37859 votes (0.11%). Best results in Verona where the political leader, Andrea Dusi, obtained 0.82% ."
