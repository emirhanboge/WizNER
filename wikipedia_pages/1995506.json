    "text": "The WCW Light Heavyweight Championship was a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20championship%23Weight%20class%20championships\"&gt;professional wrestling championship&lt;/a&gt; that was contested in &lt;a href=\"World%20Championship%20Wrestling\"&gt;World Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (WCW) between 1991 and 1992. Conceived in 1991, the championship was first awarded as the result of a single-elimination tournament; its subsequent lineage ended when the final champion &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Armstrong%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Brad Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; was stripped of the title due to injury. A second tournament to decide Armstrong's successor was announced, but never took place. The title was held by four different champions; the inaugural champion &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Pillman\"&gt;Brian Pillman&lt;/a&gt; was the only wrestler to win it on more than one occasion.\nThe light heavyweight division which contested the championship had proved popular with fans, but its viability suffered as a result of WCW's creative decisions; in 1992, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Watts\"&gt;Bill Watts&lt;/a&gt; became the head &lt;a href=\"Booking%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;booker&lt;/a&gt;, and implemented storyline changes in WCW's product which stymied the division's style. WCW would later introduce a similar title as the &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship%20%281991%E2%80%932007%29\"&gt;WCW Cruiserweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;; the two titles are now considered one and the same by the wrestling promotion &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;WWE&lt;/a&gt;, which purchased WCW's assets in 2001.\nOverview.\nCreation.\nThe WCW Light Heavyweight Championship was created in 1991, with the inaugural champion decided though a single-elimination tournament held over several weeks. Seven wrestlers were used for the tournament\u2014three quarter final matches, one of whom entered at the semi-final stages. The first two quarter finals were broadcast on \"&lt;a href=\"WCW%20WorldWide\"&gt;WorldWide&lt;/a&gt;\" in August 1991, and saw &lt;a href=\"The%20York%20Foundation\"&gt;The York Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Morton\"&gt;Richard Morton&lt;/a&gt; defeat Johnny Rich, and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Armstrong%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Badstreet&lt;/a&gt; defeat &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Maggs\"&gt;Joey Maggs&lt;/a&gt;. The next month, WCW's \"&lt;a href=\"WCW%20Main%20Event\"&gt;Main Event&lt;/a&gt;\" featured the last quarter final, in which &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Graham%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Mike Graham&lt;/a&gt; triumphed over another York Foundation member in &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Taylor\"&gt;Terrance Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth of the semi final matches were held at September's \"&lt;a href=\"Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%20XVI\"&gt;Clash of the Champions XVI&lt;/a&gt;\" event in &lt;a href=\"Augusta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Augusta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; Morton defeated Graham in a &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;heel&lt;/a&gt; finish which depicted him using several illegal advantages to win. In the other leg of the tournament, Badstreet was defeated by the newly-entering &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Pillman\"&gt;Brian Pillman&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Diving%20crossbody\"&gt;body press&lt;/a&gt; from the top rope. Morton and Pillman contested the final round at the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Havoc%20%281991%29\"&gt;1991 Halloween Havoc&lt;/a&gt; event, held in &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;; Pillman won the match and championship with another top rope body press.\nDefending the title.\nPillman's reign as champion continued until December 1991, when he began to feud with masked Japanese wrestler &lt;a href=\"Jushin%20Thunder%20Liger\"&gt;Jushin Thunder Liger&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated Pillman for the championship at a &lt;a href=\"house%20show\"&gt;house show&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; on December 25, 1991. Pillman reclaimed the title in a rematch at the &lt;a href=\"SuperBrawl%20II\"&gt;SuperBrawl II&lt;/a&gt; pay-per-view event on February 29 the following year in &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the only wrestler to hold the championship more than once.\nPillman successfully defended the championship against &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Zenk\"&gt;Tom Zenk&lt;/a&gt; at the May 17 &lt;a href=\"WrestleWar%20%281992%29\"&gt;WrestleWar&lt;/a&gt; event in &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, before being defeated by &lt;a href=\"Raven%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Scotty Flamingo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, during the June 20 &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Blast%20%281992%29\"&gt;Beach Blast&lt;/a&gt; pay-per-view. Flamingo's brief reign was ended by Brad Armstrong during a house show; the match was filmed out-of-sequence with several other televised championship matches, which meant Flamingo would tape a defense against Scott Sandlin despite having already lost the championship, while Armstrong recorded a match against &lt;a href=\"Tracy%20Smothers\"&gt;Tracy Smothers&lt;/a&gt; that would air as a title defense despite being shot before his win was officially acknowledged. Armstrong's reign saw the return of Liger as a challenger; they fought on several occasions, either with Armstrong winning or the match ending in a draw. Armstrong's last successful defense of the Light Heavyweight Championship was against Flamingo on August 14 in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Fort Myers, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nVacancy and legacy.\nAs the September 1992 \"&lt;a href=\"Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%20XX\"&gt;Clash of the Champions XX&lt;/a&gt;\" approached, Armstrong suffered a knee injury in a match with &lt;a href=\"Keiji%20Mutoh\"&gt;The Great Muta&lt;/a&gt; during a tour with &lt;a href=\"New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling\"&gt;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and was unable to participate in a planned title match against Pillman at the event. Armstrong was formally stripped of the belt at Clash of the Champions, depicted as the result of him not defending it for thirty days, and another tournament to appoint a new champion was announced. However, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Watts\"&gt;Bill Watts&lt;/a&gt; had taken over the role of head &lt;a href=\"Booking%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;booker&lt;/a&gt; for WCW and began to implement several changes in the work being produced. Among Watts' edicts was a new rule that would depict any maneuver performed from the top rope of the ring as illegal and resulting in disqualification; this effectively ended the viability of the light heavyweight style, which relied extensively on such moves, even though the matches involved in the championship picture had been considered \"outstanding\" by the fans. As a result, the planned tournament was never held and the light heavyweight division was ignored for the remainder of Watts' tenure.\nIn 1996, WCW once again held a tournament to crown a champion for the weight class, this time under the title &lt;a href=\"WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship%20%281991%E2%80%932007%29\"&gt;WCW Cruiserweight Championship&lt;/a&gt;. The first champion under this new lineage was &lt;a href=\"Shinjiro%20Otani\"&gt;Shinjiro Otani&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Benoit\"&gt;Chris Benoit&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament final. After the acquisition of WCW's assets by rival company &lt;a href=\"WWE\"&gt;WWE&lt;/a&gt;, both title lineages were considered to be related, and WWE refers to the holders of the Light Heavyweight Championship as former Cruiserweight Champions."
