    "text": "Jack David Shantry (born 29 January 1988) is a former English &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;er who played &lt;a href=\"county%20cricket\"&gt;county cricket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Worcestershire&lt;/a&gt;.\nShantry played for Shropshire Under-17s as early as July 2004, scoring 64 at the top of the &lt;a href=\"batting%20order%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; against Yorkshire Under-17s.\nHe made several further appearances for Shropshire Under-17s, and also played for &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Shrewsbury Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in the &lt;a href=\"Cockspur%20Cup\"&gt;Cockspur Cup&lt;/a&gt; and making an appearance against &lt;a href=\"Kidderminster%20Victoria%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Kidderminster Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20and%20District%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Birmingham and District Premier League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007 and 2008, Shantry progressed to a mixture of senior cricket at &lt;a href=\"minor%20counties\"&gt;minor counties&lt;/a&gt; level with &lt;a href=\"Shropshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Shropshire County Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; and Second XI cricket for Worcestershire. He took 7/34 for Worcestershire Second XI against &lt;a href=\"Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Leicestershire II&lt;/a&gt; in June 2008,\nand scored 88 for Shropshire against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20Minor%20Counties%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Wales Minor Counties&lt;/a&gt; in August of the same year.\nBetween these two feats, in July, he had appeared for Shropshire in the final of the Resource Bank Twenty20 Cup, which they lost to a star-studded &lt;a href=\"Lashings%20World%20XI\"&gt;Lashings World XI&lt;/a&gt; side despite Shantry's 3/11.\nShantry made his senior debut for Worcestershire in a &lt;a href=\"Pro40\"&gt;Pro40&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Park%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Colchester&lt;/a&gt; on 23 August 2009, taking the wicket of &lt;a href=\"Ravi%20Bopara\"&gt;Ravi Bopara&lt;/a&gt; and not batting.\nTwo days later, he made his maiden appearance in &lt;a href=\"first-class%20cricket\"&gt;first-class cricket&lt;/a&gt; when he was selected for Worcestershire's &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship\"&gt;County Championship&lt;/a&gt; clash with &lt;a href=\"Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"New%20Road%2C%20Worcester\"&gt;New Road&lt;/a&gt;. In a drawn game, Shantry claimed the wickets of &lt;a href=\"Bilal%20Shafayat\"&gt;Bilal Shafayat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Ealham\"&gt;Mark Ealham&lt;/a&gt;, but was &lt;a href=\"Leg%20before%20wicket\"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; for nought in his only innings.\nHe retained his place in the side in both one-day and four-day cricket, and so his &lt;a href=\"club%20cricket\"&gt;club cricket&lt;/a&gt; appearances, now for &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, became less frequent.\nShantry pressed his claims for a regular place in the side in his first game of the 2010 season, a non-first-class warm-up match against &lt;a href=\"Bradford/Leeds%20University%20Centre%20of%20Cricketing%20Excellence\"&gt;Bradford/Leeds UCCE&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed 5\u201318 in the first innings, and opened the bowling in the second innings, taking a wicket with the first ball of the innings and finishing with 7\u201347, to complete a match haul of 12 wickets for 65. Worcestershire went on to win the game.\nIn September 2014, he scored his maiden first-class century (and took ten wickets in a first-class match for the first time) in a victory over Surrey that guaranteed Worcestershire promotion to Division 1.\nIn June 2018, Shantry announced his retirement from all cricket with immediate effect, due to ongoing back injuries."
