    "text": "Alexander Boyd Williams (born 15 January 1983), is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;. He has previously played in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Scottish Football League First Division&lt;/a&gt; for several clubs.\nCareer.\nWilliams began his career with &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling Albion&lt;/a&gt;, where he exploded onto the scene as a teenager, scoring 21 times in 61 appearances, and being linked to moves with big English clubs, such as &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Spurs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams headed to &lt;a href=\"Greenock%20Morton%20F.C.\"&gt;Greenock Morton&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 for \u00a350,000. His time at Morton, and his subsequent career prospects, were marred by an unproven betting scandal after the club lost a 14-point lead at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; to finish the season in fourth position. Williams later claimed that this rumour had a severe effect on his career, as clubs were unwilling to consider signing him despite his track record.\nAfter a short loan spell with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt;, Williams joined &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. He made an instant impact, scoring after three minutes of his d\u00e9but against &lt;a href=\"Brechin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Brechin City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Williams finished as Clyde's top scorer &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.%20season%202005-06\"&gt;that season&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 13 league goals, and played in a famous &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; victory over &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams moved to Australia in 2006, and joined &lt;a href=\"Armadale%20SC\"&gt;Armadale&lt;/a&gt;. This only lasted a few weeks, and he later returned to Scotland to join &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt;. He only played a handful of games for County, as injury disrupted his time there. Williams then joined up with old team Clyde in January 2007, when he was re-signed after playing as a trialist in a series of matches. His contract with Clyde expired in May 2007. It was not renewed, and he subsequently left the club.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Ayr%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Ayr United&lt;/a&gt; in July 2007 and proved a hit with the Somerset Park faithful, scoring plenty goals for the club, including two tremendous strikes away to &lt;a href=\"Raith%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Raith Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2007-08%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season. In the &lt;a href=\"2008-09%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2008-09 Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, he scored a last minute equalising goal against &lt;a href=\"Ayrshire%20derby\"&gt;Ayrshire derby&lt;/a&gt; rivals &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; to earn a replay and a much needed cash boost for the club.\nOn 8 June 2009, his contract with Ayr was terminated by mutual consent, and he subsequently signed for &lt;a href=\"Dundalk%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundalk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;League of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, where he scored on his d\u00e9but. Williams signed for &lt;a href=\"St%20Patrick%27s%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;St. Patrick's Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in January 2010. Williams scored on his St.Pat's debut vs &lt;a href=\"Wexford%20Youths%20F.C.\"&gt;Wexford Youths&lt;/a&gt; in a pre-season friendly, the \"Saints\" won 3-0. In late June 2010, his club contract was terminated by mutual consent, and on 22 July he joined Stenhousemuir on a one-year deal. He was released at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2010-11%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2010-11&lt;/a&gt; season along with 11 others.\nIn January 2013, Williams and Kristopher O'Malley pleaded guilty to charges of supplying designer drugs &lt;a href=\"methylone\"&gt;methylone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naphyrone\"&gt;naphyrone&lt;/a&gt;. The lawyer representing Williams said that he had become involved in this activity because of financial difficulties suffered due to a gambling addiction. Williams was jailed for 32 months.\nWilliams joined &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Luncarty%20F.C.\"&gt;Luncarty&lt;/a&gt; in 2013."
