Other versions of the name that have occurred are Jwmala in 1356, Jomalum in 1414, Jomala in 1486 and Jwmala in 1494. One of oldest churches in Finland stands here as testament to these times.\nJomala was inhabited around 2000 B.C with Jettb\u00f6le being one of the most renowned prehistoric sites. Other ancient sites include Borgberget, where there was a Viking fortress, and Kasberget which was one of the many mountains where signal fires were lit when enemies were seen approaching.\nBefore the city of &lt;a href=\"Mariehamn\"&gt;Mariehamn&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1861, the peninsula where the city is situated was a part of Jomala.\nSights.\n&lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20St.%20Olaf%2C%20Jomala\"&gt;The church of Jomala&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"patron%20saint\"&gt;patron saint&lt;/a&gt; of \u00c5land, &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20II%20of%20Norway\"&gt;St. Olav&lt;/a&gt;.

A large medieval cemetery with graves from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; can be visited behind the church.\nThe Lemstr\u00f6m channel divides Jomala from its neighboring municipality, &lt;a href=\"Lemland\"&gt;Lemland&lt;/a&gt;.

The battery was situated 32 meters above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;, on the highest point of Dalsberg. Finnish, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; troops invaded it in 1918. It was dismantled in 1919 by &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; civilian workers.\nThere are various well-preserved windmills in Jomala, e.g. on \"Norrg\u00e5rd\" farm in Bj\u00f6rsby.\nCulture.\nSince Jomala belongs to the Swedish-speaking areas of Finland, &lt;a href=\"Midsummer\"&gt;Midsummer&lt;/a&gt; is celebrated every year by hoisting up a &lt;a href=\"maypole\"&gt;maypole&lt;/a&gt;.
