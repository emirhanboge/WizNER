The population was 4,591 at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;. The area that became Clintonville was first settled in March, 1855.\nHistory.\nClintonville lies within ancestral &lt;a href=\"Menominee\"&gt;Menominee&lt;/a&gt; territory. In the &lt;a href=\"Menominee%20language\"&gt;Menominee language&lt;/a&gt;, it is known as \"Om\u012bniahkan,\" \"place where pigeons are hunted\". It was ceded to the United States by the Menominee in 1836 through the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Cedars\"&gt;Treaty of the Cedars&lt;/a&gt;, an agreement to sell over four million acres to the United States as part of the negotiations about how to accommodate the &lt;a href=\"Oneida%20Indian%20Nation\"&gt;Oneida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stockbridge-Munsee%20Community\"&gt;Stockbridge-Munsee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brothertown%20Indians\"&gt;Brothertown&lt;/a&gt; peoples who were being &lt;a href=\"Indian%20removal\"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from New York to Wisconsin.

Clinton, Boardman Luman, and Mandy settled along the bank of the &lt;a href=\"Pigeon%20River%20%28Wisconsin%29\"&gt;Pigeon River&lt;/a&gt;. They built the first establishment that grew into the city of Clintonville. The home they built was constructed of poles covered with hemlock boughs. It was used until a more suitable home built of logs could be constructed.
