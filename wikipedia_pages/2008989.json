    "text": "\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\" is a song by American actor and rapper &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt;, released as the third single from his debut solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Willie%20Style\"&gt;Big Willie Style&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997). The verse is based around a &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"He%27s%20the%20Greatest%20Dancer\"&gt;He's the Greatest Dancer&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Sledge\"&gt;Sister Sledge&lt;/a&gt;, and the chorus is sampled from \"Sang and Dance\" by &lt;a href=\"the%20Bar-Kays\"&gt;the Bar-Kays&lt;/a&gt;. Released on January 26, 1998, the song was Smith's second hit produced by &lt;a href=\"Trackmasters\"&gt;Poke &amp; Tone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L.E.S.%20%28record%20producer%29\"&gt;L.E.S.&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced his long-time partner &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Jazzy%20Jeff\"&gt;Jazzy Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, though the record-scratching techniques of Jazzy Jeff can be heard in the song.\nThe song spent three weeks at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart from March 14, 1998. It also won a &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award\"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 for the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap%20Solo%20Performance\"&gt;Best Rap Solo Performance&lt;/a&gt;. It was ranked the 68th greatest song of the 1990s by &lt;a href=\"VH1\"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was ranked at number 19 on the list of &lt;a href=\"AOL%20Radio\"&gt;AOL Radio's&lt;/a&gt; 100 Worst Songs Ever in 2010. The song was included in &lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20Media\"&gt;Pitchfork Media's&lt;/a&gt; 2010 list of \"the seven worst U.S. No. 1 singles of the 90s\".\nComposition.\nThe song samples the 1979 &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Sledge\"&gt;Sister Sledge&lt;/a&gt; song \"&lt;a href=\"He%27s%20the%20Greatest%20Dancer\"&gt;He's the Greatest Dancer&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"mama-uh, mama-uh, mama come closer\" line is a reference to the song \"&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Makossa\"&gt;Soul Makossa&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Manu%20Dibango\"&gt;Manu Dibango&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the version adapted by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson\"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Wanna%20Be%20Startin%27%20Somethin%27\"&gt;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&lt;/a&gt;\"'s final bridge. The connotations associated with the expression &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aget%20jiggy\"&gt;getting jiggy&lt;/a&gt; were heavily influenced by this single. The term was originally a description of sexy fashion or style, but expanded to include dancing skill.\nSmith has attested in an interview that his inspiration to alter the meaning for the purpose of the song came from his association of the term \"jiggy\" with \"&lt;a href=\"jigaboo\"&gt;jigaboo&lt;/a&gt;\", a derogatory term for African-Americans, which made the literal meaning of the title \"getting African-American with it\" and which was meant to reference the popular folk-myth of an innate sense of &lt;a href=\"rhythm\"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt; in black folks. The co-opting of a once offensive word also was racially empowering.\nCritical reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"This intriguingly titled single is a sweet cross between &lt;a href=\"rap%20music\"&gt;rap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; styles\u2014perhaps even outrageous &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;? Despite his success in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, Smith keeps music close to his heart. He delivers a happy rap song\u2014very upbeat, indeed. A background mixture of children's voices gives this single an interesting twist, which provides pleasant interference. The vivacious bass sound makes \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It\" stand up on its feet. Even though it is repetitive, it's really a great one for those rap lovers out there. Get listening!\" \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20%26amp%3B%20Media\"&gt;Music &amp; Media&lt;/a&gt;\" commented, \"Musician-cum-actor Smith seems to have an infallible knack for simply irresistible poppy R&amp;B. This time around, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Sledge\"&gt;Sister Sledge&lt;/a&gt;'s much-loved 1979 &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; smash 'He's The Greatest Dancer' serves as the foundation for his third surefire hit in a row (after '&lt;a href=\"Men%20in%20Black%20%28song%29\"&gt;Men in Black&lt;/a&gt;' and '&lt;a href=\"Just%20Cruisin%27\"&gt;Just Cruisin'&lt;/a&gt;).\"\nMusic video.\nThe &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; for the song was directed by American director &lt;a href=\"Hype%20Williams\"&gt;Hype Williams&lt;/a&gt; and was filmed at various hotels on the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Strip\"&gt;Las Vegas Strip&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"New%20York-New%20York%20Hotel%20and%20Casino\"&gt;New York-New York Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mirage\"&gt;The Mirage&lt;/a&gt;, and the foyer of the &lt;a href=\"Luxor%20Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Luxor Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe video features a series of tableaux including a &lt;a href=\"Deee-Lite\"&gt;Deee-Lite&lt;/a&gt;-inspired sequence, a glitzy &lt;a href=\"Puffa%20jacket\"&gt;Puffa jacket&lt;/a&gt;-style choreographed studio dance routine, a sequence set in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and a volcano-backed &lt;a href=\"Native%20Hawaiians\"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; segment. Other music styles, including &lt;a href=\"Bollywood\"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt;, are referenced. The video closes with Smith dancing beneath the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; replica at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino.\n\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\" won the 1998 &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award\"&gt;MTV Video Music Award&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Best%20Rap%20Video\"&gt;Best Rap Video&lt;/a&gt;. The song was also nominated for four additional awards, including &lt;a href=\"Best%20Choreography\"&gt;Best Choreography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20%E2%80%93%20Viewer%27s%20Choice\"&gt;Viewer's Choice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Best%20Dance%20Video\"&gt;Best Dance Video&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Video of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, but these further nominations were lost to &lt;a href=\"Madonna%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; for her song \"&lt;a href=\"Ray%20of%20Light%20%28song%29\"&gt;Ray of Light&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReferences in popular culture.\nIn the 1999 film \"&lt;a href=\"Superstar%20%281999%20film%29\"&gt;Superstar&lt;/a&gt;\", lead character &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Katherine%20Gallagher\"&gt;Mary Katherine Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; gets advice from &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, played by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt;, telling her to \"Get jiggy wit it, Na na na na na na\". In the \"&lt;a href=\"Seinfeld\"&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Reverse%20Peephole\"&gt;The Reverse Peephole&lt;/a&gt;\", Jerry is disappointed at not being selected as DJ for a house party, stating, \"I was ready to get jiggy with it!\" The song is also featured in the video game \"&lt;a href=\"Backyard%20Football%20%2708\"&gt;Backyard Football '08&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe song has also been spoofed and covered by various artists. &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Screw\"&gt;DJ Screw&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"chopped%20and%20screwed\"&gt;chopped and screwed&lt;/a&gt; version of the song. Jam band &lt;a href=\"Phish\"&gt;Phish&lt;/a&gt; covered the song on their 1999 album \"&lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Comes%20Alive\"&gt;Hampton Comes Alive&lt;/a&gt;\".
