    "text": "Alexandru Hrisoverghi (February 27, 1811 \u2013 March 9, 1837) was a &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Romanian-language\"&gt;Romanian-language&lt;/a&gt; poet and translator, whose work was influenced by &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;. The author of few &lt;a href=\"Lyric%20poem\"&gt;lyrical&lt;/a&gt; works, he was foremost noted for his association with political and intellectual figures such as &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu\"&gt;Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Costache Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20C%C3%A2rlova\"&gt;Vasile C\u00e2rlova&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grigore%20Crupenschi\"&gt;Grigore Crupenschi&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;, Hrisoverghi was a member of the &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt; category: the second of \"&lt;a href=\"Vornic\"&gt;Vornic&lt;/a&gt;\" Neculai Hrisoverghi's four sons, he traced his origin to &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Phanariotes\"&gt;Phanariotes&lt;/a&gt; who were present in Moldavia during the rule of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dimitrie%20Cantemir\"&gt;Dimitrie Cantemir&lt;/a&gt;. His mother was Elena Ruset, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Rosetti%20family\"&gt;Rosetti family&lt;/a&gt;. According to his friend and biographer &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Kog%C4%83lniceanu\"&gt;Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu&lt;/a&gt;, \"Hrisoverghi took absolutely no pride in this vain noble origin; he had sufficient personal merit, without needing any more from his parents\". Neculai Hrisoverghi died in 1818.\nAlexandru Hrisoverghi's childhood and youth coincided with the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Greek War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"Filiki%20Eteria\"&gt;Filiki Eteria&lt;/a&gt; troops of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Ypsilantis%20%281792-1828%29\"&gt;Alexander Ypsilantis&lt;/a&gt; occupied Moldavia and &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;; the Hrisoverghis took refuge in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Russian&lt;/a&gt;-ruled &lt;a href=\"Bessarabia\"&gt;Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt;. It was in &lt;a href=\"Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; that he began his studies, being tutored in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; by a teacher named Constantin, before returning to his native city in 1824. After attending the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; school in Ia\u015fi, he enrolled in a &lt;a href=\"French-language\"&gt;French-language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boarding%20school\"&gt;boarding school&lt;/a&gt; headed by a professor Mouton, while being tutored in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20literature\"&gt;Ancient Greek literature&lt;/a&gt; by a Greek teacher named Franguli. According to Kog\u0103lniceanu: \"His education was superficial; but this was no fault of his, rather that of a lack in educational institutions that was being experienced in Moldavia at the time\".\nAs a consequence of the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281828%E2%80%931829%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829&lt;/a&gt;, Moldavia and Wallachia were occupied by Russia, and, soon after, became subject to the \"&lt;a href=\"Regulamentul%20Organic\"&gt;Regulamentul Organic&lt;/a&gt;\" regime. This notably provided for the creation of a &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20military%20forces\"&gt;Moldavian Militia&lt;/a&gt; force, which young people of the principality joined in large numbers after 1830. Hrisoverghi was one of them, but withdrew in 1832, after just two years of service\u2014dissatisfied with military life, he was also the sole provider for his family after two of his brothers had died. At the time, he became an avid reader of &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Ch%C3%A9nier\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier&lt;/a&gt; and other French Romantics, while leading a &lt;a href=\"Bohemianism\"&gt;Bohemian&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle and becoming noted for his affairs with women. Reportedly, he was a handsome person, and the object of compliments from women in high society.\nBy that time, Hrisoverghi was showing the symptoms of an unknown disease, which first manifested itself as &lt;a href=\"renal%20colic\"&gt;renal colic&lt;/a&gt;s. As doctors recommended exercise and fresh air, he left for the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, visiting &lt;a href=\"Rumelia\"&gt;Rumelia&lt;/a&gt; on his way to &lt;a href=\"Edirne\"&gt;Edirne&lt;/a&gt;. In Kog\u0103lniceanu's view: \"The patriarchal life of the &lt;a href=\"Bulgarians\"&gt;Bulgarians&lt;/a&gt;, their customs so unlike those of any other, more civilized and thus more commonplace, nations, the magnificent view of the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Mountains\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; still full of souvenirs from the Russian victories [in the war of 1828-1829], all that primitive nature left vivid imprints in his memory and awoke within him the poetic genius\".\nReturning to Moldavia in 1834, Alexandru Hrisoverghi published his debut work, \"Ruinelor Cet\u0103\u0163ii Neam\u0163u\" or \"Oda ruinelor Cet\u0103\u0163ii Neam\u0163u\", an &lt;a href=\"ode\"&gt;ode&lt;/a&gt; which had been prompted by news that the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgu%20Neam%C5%A3\"&gt;T\u00e2rgu Neam\u0163&lt;/a&gt; were planning to raze the nearby medieval complex and use it as a source of building material (\"see &lt;a href=\"Neam%C5%A3%20Fortress\"&gt;Neam\u0163 Fortress&lt;/a&gt;\"). Its final &lt;a href=\"stanza\"&gt;stanza&lt;/a&gt; began with the words:\n\"Ruinelor Cet\u0103\u0163ii Neam\u0163u\" had instant appeal, persuading &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sturdza\"&gt;Mihail Sturdza&lt;/a&gt; to block the T\u00e2rgu Neam\u0163 demolition projects, as well as popularizing &lt;a href=\"historic%20preservation\"&gt;historic preservation&lt;/a&gt; throughout Moldavia.\nOver the following years, Hrisovergi pursued a romantic affair with Catinca Beldiman, the wife of \"Vornic\" Nicolae Dimachi (himself an amateur poet). According to Kog\u0103lniceanu (who did not mention her name): \"She was a young, beautiful woman, with a vivid imagination, who had kept alive all the illusions of her childhood and who, resonating with the young poet's fiery words, answered him: love me, be blessed; make yourself a luminous name among men, so you may cover me with your glory. Hrisoverghi found in her the ideal heroine he had previously read about in works by &lt;a href=\"George%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron\"&gt;Byron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20p%C3%A8re\"&gt;Dumas&lt;/a&gt; and those of so many novelists; he gained a soul to understand his own soul, a heart for his heart, a star for his horizon. He thus forgot everything else, glory, honors, future, in order to live for his loved one\". Kog\u0103lniceanu noted that all of Hrisoverghi's works after that moment, his poems as well as his translation of Dumas' \"Antony\", evidenced the inspiration Hrisoverghi had received from the object of his affection. \"Antony\" was first published posthumously by the &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"printing%20press\"&gt;printing press&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt;, and featured a preface by &lt;a href=\"Costache%20Negruzzi\"&gt;Costache Negruzzi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso in 1834, Hrisoverghi welcomed the arrival of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mihail%20Sturdza\"&gt;Mihail Sturdza&lt;/a&gt;, through which the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; consecrated the end of &lt;a href=\"Phanariotes\"&gt;Phanariote&lt;/a&gt; rules, and authored a poem in Sturdza's honor (\"Oda pentru venirea \u00ee. s. domnului st\u0103p\u00e2nitor\"). After that moment, he also decided to regain the Militia (August 1834), serving as &lt;a href=\"adjutant\"&gt;adjutant&lt;/a&gt; to the \"&lt;a href=\"Hatman\"&gt;Hatman&lt;/a&gt;\". In late December, Sturdza welcomed him on his personal staff, where he served as princely adjutant, being promoted &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; in January 1836.\nIn February, after he was present at a &lt;a href=\"masquerade%20ball\"&gt;masquerade ball&lt;/a&gt; in Ia\u015fi, he left on mission to &lt;a href=\"Cod%C4%83e%C5%9Fti\"&gt;Pribe\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;, traveling through a &lt;a href=\"blizzard\"&gt;blizzard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014this contributed to the subsequent decline of his health. Physicians recommended that he seek help from &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; specialized doctors in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, who ultimately directed him to the &lt;a href=\"thermal%20bath\"&gt;thermal bath&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Two Sicilies&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Ischia\"&gt;Ischia&lt;/a&gt;. This treatment failed to improve his condition, and, following his return to Moldavia, Hrisoverghi never left his bed. In constant pain for the following year, he died soon after turning 26, and was buried at the Sf\u00e2ntul Nicolae din Deal Church in Ia\u015fi. His funeral was attended by a large group of officers and young civilians. The &lt;a href=\"autopsy\"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; reportedly uncovered that Hrisoverghi died of complications from \"&lt;a href=\"tabes%20dorsalis\"&gt;tabes dorsalis&lt;/a&gt;\", which medicine of the time attributed to &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn connection to his death, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Sion\"&gt;Gheorghe Sion&lt;/a&gt; later claimed that Hrisoverghi was severely injured after jumping from a window, when caught in his lover's arms by her husband; allegedly, his rival took him into his care. This account, which probably referred to Catinca Beldiman and her husband, was doubted by &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt;, who noted that it may have been entirely borrowed from \"Antony\".\nA book of his collected works was published in 1843, and included his &lt;a href=\"panegyric\"&gt;panegyric&lt;/a&gt;s to various potentates of his day. Most of his poems were left in unpolished stages, including one he composed on his deathbed:\nLegacy.\nKog\u0103lniceanu, who defined Hrisoverghi's views as \"&lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and in balance with the times\", noted the influence exercised by &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Ch%C3%A9nier\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier&lt;/a&gt; on his style, and drew parallels between the two authors' lives (including their ambivalent attitudes toward military life). In addition, he credited the writer with having introduced a national focus in Moldavian literature, which, he claimed, lagged behind that of &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt; in this respect (while acknowledging that Hrisoverghi's poems would occasionally rank below modern standards). The poet &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Alecsandri\"&gt;Vasile Alecsandri&lt;/a&gt;, whose career began soon after Hrisoverghi died, looked back on the period in an introduction to writings by his friend Negruzzi: \"The development of ideas and the purifying of literary taste were very bitterly made aware of the government's oppressive system, and the impetus of writers broke off its wings, crashing into public indifference like one would into a rock. Old people would only read the lives of the saints; and youngsters would read nothing at all, holding Romanian books in contempt, and among those youngsters only an Alexandru Hrisoverghi and a Costache Negruzzi: \"&lt;a href=\"rari%20nantes%20in%20gurgite%20vasto\"&gt;rari nantes in gurgite vasto&lt;/a&gt;\" would tap their foreheads, saying, like Ch\u00e9nier in the hour of his death: \"Et pourtant je sens que j'ai quelque chose l\u00e0\" [\"And yet I feel that have something here\"]!\".\nIn later periods, literary critics took more reserved stands in respect to Hrisoverghi's contribution to &lt;a href=\"Literature%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian literature&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Zarifopol\"&gt;Paul Zarifopol&lt;/a&gt; expressed disapproval of Hrisoverghi and many of his contemporaries (including &lt;a href=\"Ien%C4%83chi%C5%A3%C4%83%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu\"&gt;Ien\u0103chi\u0163\u0103&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iancu%20V%C4%83c%C4%83rescu\"&gt;Iancu V\u0103c\u0103rescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20C%C3%A2rlova\"&gt;Vasile C\u00e2rlova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Asachi\"&gt;Gheorghe Asachi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Heliade%20R%C4%83dulescu\"&gt;Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu&lt;/a&gt;). While commending Kog\u0103lniceanu for establishing an influential school of &lt;a href=\"literary%20criticism\"&gt;literary criticism&lt;/a&gt;, he noted that the emphasis he had placed on \"national specificity\" had led him to overestimate the value of poets such as Hrisoverghi. Writing a decade later, &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C4%83linescu\"&gt;George C\u0103linescu&lt;/a&gt; noted that \"Ruinelor Cet\u0103\u0163ii Neam\u0163u\" was \"a disgraceful replica of C\u00e2rlova's \"Ruinurile T\u00e2rgovi\u015ftii\"\". He also stressed the &lt;a href=\"misogyny\"&gt;misogyny&lt;/a&gt; present in several lyrics authored by Hrisoverghi, which he defined as \"[having] the stray impulses of Romantic jokes and featuring ridiculous invectives\". In respect to this, he cited the &lt;a href=\"stanza\"&gt;stanza&lt;/a&gt;:\nBesides his translation of Dumas' novel, Alexandru Hrisoverghi is noted for those of poems by Ch\u00e9nier (to which he notably added his own verses), &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schiller\"&gt;Friedrich Schiller&lt;/a&gt; (probably, through a &lt;a href=\"French-language\"&gt;French-language&lt;/a&gt; translation), &lt;a href=\"Alphonse%20de%20Lamartine\"&gt;Alphonse de Lamartine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. He is the main character in a 1943 novel by &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20R%C3%A2%C5%9Fcanu\"&gt;Theodor R\u00e2\u015fcanu&lt;/a&gt; (\"Fermec\u0103torul Hrisoverghi\")."
