    "text": "Pelucones (&lt;a href=\"spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for bigwigs) was the name used to refer to Chilean &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;s in early 19th century. The name \"Pelucones\" was originally used by the \"&lt;a href=\"Pipiolos\"&gt;Pipiolos&lt;/a&gt;\", or Liberals, as a derogatory term linking the conservatives to old fashioned &lt;a href=\"wig\"&gt;wig&lt;/a&gt;s that were popular in the 18th century. Following the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20Civil%20War%20of%201829\"&gt;Chilean Civil War of 1829&lt;/a&gt;, when the \"Pipiolos\" were defeated, the \"Pelucones\" enforced the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20Constitution%20of%201833\"&gt;Chilean Constitution of 1833&lt;/a&gt;. This led to creation of a strong &lt;a href=\"unitary%20state\"&gt;unitary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"authoritarian\"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"presidentialist\"&gt;presidentialist&lt;/a&gt; system supported and maintained by the upper classes."
