    "text": "Vatican Radio (; ) is the official &lt;a href=\"broadcasting\"&gt;broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; service of &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstablished in 1931 by &lt;a href=\"Guglielmo%20Marconi\"&gt;Guglielmo Marconi&lt;/a&gt;, today its programs are offered in 47 languages, and are sent out on &lt;a href=\"short%20wave\"&gt;short wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Radio%20Mondiale\"&gt;DRM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medium%20wave\"&gt;medium wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FM%20radio\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satellite\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20radio\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Since its inception, Vatican Radio has been maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit Order&lt;/a&gt;. Vatican Radio preserved its independence during the rise of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Italy%20as%20a%20monarchy%20and%20in%20the%20World%20Wars%23The%20Fascist%20regime\"&gt;Fascist Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, programming is produced by over 200 journalists located in 61 countries. Vatican Radio produces more than 42,000 hours of simultaneous broadcasting covering international news, religious celebrations, in-depth programs, and music. The current general director is Father &lt;a href=\"Federico%20Lombardi\"&gt;Federico Lombardi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;S.J.&lt;/a&gt;\nOn 27 June 2015, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;, in a \"&lt;a href=\"motu%20proprio\"&gt;motu proprio&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20letter\"&gt;apostolic letter&lt;/a&gt;, established the &lt;a href=\"Secretariat%20for%20Communications\"&gt;Secretariat for Communications&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Curia\"&gt;Roman Curia&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbed Vatican Radio effective 1 January 2017, ending the organization's 85 years of independent operation.\nHistory.\n1930s.\nVatican Radio began broadcasting with the callsign HVJ on two shortwave frequencies using 10 &lt;a href=\"kilowatts\"&gt;kilowatts&lt;/a&gt; (kW) of power on 12 February 1931, with the pontificial message \"Omni creaturae\" of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XI\"&gt;Pope Pius XI&lt;/a&gt;. Also in attendance was &lt;a href=\"Guglielmo%20Marconi\"&gt;Guglielmo Marconi&lt;/a&gt; and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who would become &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XII\"&gt;Pope Pius XII&lt;/a&gt;. Its first director was &lt;a href=\"physicist\"&gt;physicist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Gianfranceschi\"&gt;Giuseppe Gianfranceschi&lt;/a&gt;, who was also the president of the &lt;a href=\"Accademia%20dei%20Lincei\"&gt;Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1933, a permanent &lt;a href=\"Microwave%20radio%20relay\"&gt;microwave link&lt;/a&gt; was established between the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Palace\"&gt;Vatican Palace&lt;/a&gt; and the summer residence of the papacy, &lt;a href=\"Castel%20Gandolfo\"&gt;Castel Gandolfo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1936, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Telecommunication%20Union\"&gt;International Telecommunication Union&lt;/a&gt; (ITU) recognized Vatican Radio as a \"special case\" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On 25 December 1937 a &lt;a href=\"Telefunken\"&gt;Telefunken&lt;/a&gt; 25\u00a0kW transmitter and two &lt;a href=\"directional%20antenna\"&gt;directional antenna&lt;/a&gt;s were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.\nWorld War II.\nFollowing a December 1939 report from Cardinal &lt;a href=\"August%20Hlond\"&gt;August Hlond&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt; detailing the oppression of the Catholic Church in Poland, Pope Pius XII decided, among other measures, to use Vatican Radio to provide \"information regarding the condition of the church in Poland.\" The German broadcast on 21 January 1940 compared German activities to \"what the Communists imposed on Spain in 1936\"; the English service noted the attacks on the Church were not limited to the Soviets.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were (like all foreign broadcasts) banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.\nWhile some critics have said Pope Pius XII was too quiet regarding the Holocaust, Jacques Adler examined the transcripts of wartime broadcasts over the Vatican Radio. Adler argues that it exposed Nazi persecution of the Church and opposed collaboration with Nazism. It appealed to Catholics to remain true to their faith's injunctions: to defend the sanctity of life and the unity of humankind. In so doing the Pope pursued a policy of spiritual resistance to Nazi ideology and racism.\n1940s and 1950s.\nIn 1948, services expanded to 18 languages.\nDue to space constraints, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt; acquired a 400-&lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt; area located 18 kilometres north of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20di%20Galeria\"&gt;Santa Maria di Galeria&lt;/a&gt; (GC: ). The &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republic\"&gt;Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt; granted the site extraterritorial status in 1952.\nIn 1957, a new broadcasting center was placed in operation, with a &lt;a href=\"Philips\"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; 100\u00a0kW &lt;a href=\"shortwave\"&gt;shortwave&lt;/a&gt; transmitter, two 10\u00a0kW shortwave transmitters, and one 120\u00a0kW &lt;a href=\"mediumwave\"&gt;mediumwave&lt;/a&gt; transmitter, with 21 directional and one &lt;a href=\"omnidirectional%20antenna\"&gt;omnidirectional antenna&lt;/a&gt;. The next phase involved two 100\u00a0kW transmitters aimed at Africa and &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;, a 250\u00a0kW mediumwave transmitter for Europe, and a 500\u00a0kW transmitter for the Far East and Latin America.\nRadio Vaticana was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Broadcasting%20Union\"&gt;European Broadcasting Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1950.\n2000s.\nIn the 21st century, Vatican Radio has experimented with digital transmission technologies (DRM, T-DAB, T-DMB) and has used electronic newsletters, podcasts, and other new technologies to distribute its programming. Vatican Radio and CTV began their own YouTube channel in 2010, operating in four languages, and operates six Twitter accounts.\nIn May 2009 it was announced that Vatican Radio would begin broadcasting commercial advertisements for the first time in July. The decision was made to meet the radio's rising costs, namely 21.4m &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s a year. All advertisements would have to meet \"high moral standards\". Vatican Radio stopped transmitting short- and medium-wave broadcasts to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday 1 July 2012. The &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Press%20Office\"&gt;Vatican Press Office&lt;/a&gt; closed &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Information%20Service\"&gt;Vatican Information Service&lt;/a&gt; in August 2012.\nIn 2014 Michael Gannon, from Ireland, became the first person with Down Syndrome to work at any Vatican office, which he did as an intern at Vatican Radio.\nAs of 2016, Vatican Radio had a staff of 355 people who produce more than 66 hours of daily programming in 45 languages on air, and 38 languages on the website. Programs are broadcast via short wave, FM and satellite.\nVatican Radio has been losing between \u20ac20 and \u20ac30 million annually. With its absorption into the Curia's Secretariat for Communications on 1 January 2017 Vatican Radio director Msgr. &lt;a href=\"Dario%20Edoardo%20Vigan%C3%B2\"&gt;Dario Vigan\u00f2&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that he plans to pare down short-wave radio operations and institute cost control measures in the service's other broadcast operations.\nOn 24 March 2017, Vatican Radio made its final English-language shortwave transmission to &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; after 59 years of service. Vatican Radio's English Service for Asia has then continued online.\nTelevision and Satellite.\nDuring the 1930s, the station made experimental television broadcasts. Apart from a brief experimental revival in the 1950s, it was not until the 1990s that a regular 'satellite' television service began. The programs of &lt;a href=\"TV2000\"&gt;TV2000&lt;/a&gt; include programming from &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Television%20Center\"&gt;Vatican Television Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nVatican Channel HD is available in English and Italian on the satellite through Eutelsat Hot Bird 13\u00b0est (11334 MHz, pol.H, Sr 27500,3/4 and Vatican Media Europe multilanguage on Hot Bird 13B (12475 MHz, pol.H, Sr 29900, 3/4).\nVatican Radio Europe is available via satellite through Eutelsat Hot Bird 13\u00b0est (12476 MHz, pol.H, Sr 29900, 3/4 and Radio Vaticana 5, in italian Eutelsat 9B (12466 MHz, pol.V, Sr 41950, 3/4).\nTransmitters.\nThe signals are transmitted from a large shortwave and medium-wave transmission facility for Radio Vatican. The Santa Maria di Galeria Transmitter was established in 1957 and it is an extraterritorial area in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Holy See. Vatican Radio's &lt;a href=\"interval%20signal\"&gt;interval signal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christus%20Vincit\"&gt;Christus Vincit&lt;/a&gt;, is a well-known sound on shortwave radio.\nOne aerial for the medium wave frequency 1530\u00a0kHz which consists of four grounded freestanding towers arranged in a square, which carry wires for a medium wave aerial on horizontal crossbars. The direction of this aerial can be changed.\nFrom May 2014 to December 2016 the antennas of Santa Maria di Galeria were progressively decommissioned, which radiated the average wave signal on 1530 kHz with programs destined for Italy, Europe and the Mediterranean area.\nRadiation controversy.\nThe Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the &lt;a href=\"non-ionising%20radiation\"&gt;non-ionising radiation&lt;/a&gt; from the site has &lt;a href=\"Microwave%20radiation%23Health%20effects\"&gt;affected their health.&lt;/a&gt;"
