    "text": "The Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC) is a &lt;a href=\"convention%20center\"&gt;convention center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Enclosing some 3.9 million ft2 (360,000 m2) in exhibition space and hosting more than a million visitors each year, the GWCC is the third-largest convention center in the United States. Opened in 1976, the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States. The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which was chartered in 1971 by &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;Georgia General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta. The authority later developed the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Olympic%20Park\"&gt;Centennial Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced the Georgia Dome. In 2017, the Georgia Dome was closed on March 5 and demolished by implosion on November 20 while Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened on August 26. While the GWCCA owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AMB Group, the parent organization for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Falcons\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20United%20FC\"&gt;Atlanta United FC&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for the stadium's operations.\nIn addition to convention and trade shows, the GWCC often coordinated with the Georgia Dome to host activities in conjunction with major events being held at the dome. Every year, the center hosts &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Football%20Fanfare\"&gt;SEC Football Fanfare&lt;/a&gt;, a two-day fan festival for the thousands of &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"american%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; fans in the city for the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;. The center played host to a similar event in tandem with &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20XXVII\"&gt;WrestleMania XXVII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WrestleMania%20Axxess\"&gt;WrestleMania Axxess&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Family%20Feud\"&gt;Family Feud&lt;/a&gt;\" started taping at Georgia World Congress Center in 2015 and stayed there until 2017, when it moved back to Los Angeles. \"Feud\" returned to Georgia World Congress Center in August 2020.\nThe GWCC is located in downtown Atlanta at 285 Andrew Young International Boulevard NW, adjacent to &lt;a href=\"CNN%20Center\"&gt;CNN Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"State%20Farm%20Arena%20%28Atlanta%29\"&gt;State Farm Arena&lt;/a&gt;. Public transportation is serviced by the &lt;a href=\"GWCC/CNN%20Center%20station\"&gt;GWCC/CNN Center&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Atlanta%20Rapid%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;MARTA&lt;/a&gt; station. &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Air%20Lines\"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; previously had a ticket office in the lobby of the complex.\nThough similarly named, the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20International%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;Georgia International Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; is a smaller unrelated facility located near &lt;a href=\"Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nThe GWCC is made up of three adjacent buildings, Buildings A, B, and C. In total these buildings have twelve exhibit halls, 105 meeting rooms, and two ballrooms. Building A has three exhibit halls and the &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Marcus\"&gt;Sidney Marcus&lt;/a&gt; auditorium seating 1,740. Building B, the largest, contains five exhibit halls and the 33,000 square-foot (3,065 m 2) &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20B.%20Murphy\"&gt;Thomas B. Murphy&lt;/a&gt; Ballroom.

The complex incorporates pedestrian bridges to connect exhibit halls on opposite sides of the tracks.\nHistory.\n\"See article: &lt;a href=\"2008%20Atlanta%20tornado%20outbreak\"&gt;2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDesigned by Atlanta-based architects &lt;a href=\"tvsdesign\"&gt;tvsdesign&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback &amp; Associates \u2013 TVS), the GWCC opened in 1976 with of exhibit space. Additional phases opened in 1985, 1992, and 2002. During the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, the GWCC hosted &lt;a href=\"handball%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fencing%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"judo%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;judo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Table%20Tennis%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;table tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weightlifting%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;weightlifting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wrestling%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, and the fencing and shooting portions of the &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Pentathlon%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;modern pentathlon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Broadcast%20Centre\"&gt;International Broadcast Centre&lt;/a&gt; for the worldwide media was also set up inside the GWCC.\nOn November 8, 2001, President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; made a speech at the GWCC in which he exhorted the crowd of &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"firefighter\"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt;s, \"My fellow Americans, &lt;a href=\"Let%27s%20roll\"&gt;Let's roll&lt;/a&gt;!\", He was invoking the last words of &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Beamer\"&gt;Todd Beamer&lt;/a&gt;, a passenger on &lt;a href=\"United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093\"&gt;United Airlines Flight 93&lt;/a&gt; (one of the flights &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20hijacking\"&gt;hijacked&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"September%2011%2C%202001\"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt;), who was one of the participants in an attempt to storm the cockpit and wrest control of the airplane from the hijackers. He would use the words again in the 2002 &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20the%20Union\"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; address: \"For too long our culture has said, 'If it feels good, do it.' Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: 'Let's roll.'\"\nThe center also hosted the 2009 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Train%20Music%20Awards\"&gt;Soul Train Music Awards&lt;/a&gt;, the first held outside of the Los Angeles area.\nOn March 14, 2008, a &lt;a href=\"tornado\"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; struck &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Atlanta\"&gt;downtown area&lt;/a&gt;. The Georgia World Congress Center was heavily damaged by the storm, including roof and water damage. In addition to rain pouring in from the holes in the roof, there was also water damage from the sprinkler system and broken water pipes. The extent of the damage led to the cancellation of immediate events. After the disaster, a letter was posted on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gwcc.com\"&gt;GWCC's website&lt;/a&gt; detailing the closure of the GWCC. However, the facility along with the nearby Georgia Dome was able to be repaired enough to host the &lt;a href=\"FIRST%20Championship\"&gt;FIRST Robotics World Championship&lt;/a&gt; during the dates of April 18\u201320. The Georgia Dome and the Congress Center were also ready in time for the International Career Development Conference (ICDC) run by &lt;a href=\"DECA%20%28organization%29\"&gt;DECA&lt;/a&gt;, an association of marketing students from around the country. &lt;a href=\"FBLA-PBL\"&gt;FBLA-PBL&lt;/a&gt;, a student business organization, held its opening and closing sessions for the National Leadership Conference in 2008 there. The tornado was the first to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s. &lt;a href=\"FBLA-PBL\"&gt;FBLA-PBL&lt;/a&gt; once again held their FBLA National Leadership Conference in the Congress Center in 2016 for Opening and Closing Session, with over 12,000 attendees. &lt;a href=\"DECA%20%28organization%29\"&gt;DECA&lt;/a&gt; once again held their DECA International Career Development Conference (ICDC) in 2018 in the facility, with over 19,000 attendees.\nOn April 12, 2020, state officials announced plans to convert a portion of the GWCC into a temporary 200-bed hospital in response to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The temporary hospital will treat coronavirus patients with mild to moderate symptoms, allowing area hospitals to allocate its resources towards treating critical patients, specifically those requiring ventilators."
