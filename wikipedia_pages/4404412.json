    "text": "S. Darius and S. Gir\u0117nas stadium () is a multi-use stadium in the &lt;a href=\"%C4%84%C5%BEuolynas\"&gt;\u0104\u017euolynas&lt;/a&gt; park in &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDaliakalnis\"&gt;\u017daliakalnis&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, that is now being reconstructed. The all-seater stadium will hold 15,315 people. In 1998 the stadium was renovated according to &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; regulations, and in 2005 it was modernised with the installation of the biggest stadium television screen in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20states\"&gt;Baltic states&lt;/a&gt;. The latest renovation started in 2018. It will be the biggest stadium in the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20states\"&gt;Baltic states&lt;/a&gt;. It hosts Lithuanian football matches as well as international &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; championships. During a sporting season about 50 events are held here.\nHistory.\nThe first stadium in this place was designed and established by &lt;a href=\"Steponas%20Darius\"&gt;Steponas Darius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%C4%99stutis%20Bulota\"&gt;K\u0119stutis Bulota&lt;/a&gt; in 1923, and completed in 1925. In 1935\u20131936, the stadium was renovated and named the \"State Stadium\" (). Starting in 1969 the stadium underwent another reconstruction that lasted for 10 years until August 1979. Wooden tribunes were replaced with &lt;a href=\"reinforced%20concrete\"&gt;reinforced concrete&lt;/a&gt; structures and placed in a half circle.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20March%2011\"&gt;Lithuania regained independence&lt;/a&gt;, in 1993 the stadium was named after the Lithuanian pilots Steponas Darius and &lt;a href=\"Stasys%20Gir%C4%97nas\"&gt;Stasys Gir\u0117nas&lt;/a&gt;, who perished in a crash near the end of an &lt;a href=\"Lithuanica\"&gt;attempted non-stop flight from New York to Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. The site is currently the home ground of the football club &lt;a href=\"FK%20Kauno%20%C5%BDalgiris\"&gt;FK Kauno \u017dalgiris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Stumbras\"&gt;FC Stumbras&lt;/a&gt;. It is a part of the S. Darius and S. Gir\u0117nas sport center, which also includes the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kaunas%20Sports%20Hall\"&gt;Kaunas Sports Hall&lt;/a&gt;, built in 1939.\nReconstruction.\nIn July 2010, talks began that modernizing the stadium is the cheapest option for Lithuania to develop a football stadium that could host international matches. Two thirds of the renovation costs were proposed to be provided by &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Lithuanian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;. Despite many initiatives to launch the renovation from various groups no actual actions were started, as an agreement for funding and project specifications could not be achieved.\nAnother attempt to revitalize the stadium was started in February 2016 by the newly elected Kaunas City Municipality which adopted a plan to revamp major sport infrastructure in Kaunas. Early proposals suggested that the seating capacity should be expanded to 12,500\u201320,000 roof-covered seats, &lt;a href=\"under-soil%20heating\"&gt;under-soil heating&lt;/a&gt; installed, and stadium should reach &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20stadium%20categories\"&gt;Category 4 of UEFA stadium classification&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 18 August 2017, the reconstruction project was officially presented to the public. After the reconstruction, the stadium will have seating capacity of 15,315 for sport events and up to 30,000 for concerts and other events. On 15 June 2018, &lt;a href=\"Kay%C4%B1%20Construction\"&gt;Kay\u0131 Construction&lt;/a&gt; and Kaunas City Municipality signed the reconstruction contract. The stadium will be opened after 18\u201320 months (works will begin in July 2018). The stadium will have &lt;a href=\"Desso%20GrassMaster\"&gt;Desso GrassMaster&lt;/a&gt; surface and completely covered with a roof over the stands."
