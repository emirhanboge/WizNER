    "text": "The Reeperbahn () is a street and entertainment district in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"St.%20Pauli\"&gt;St. Pauli&lt;/a&gt; district, one of the two centres of Hamburg's &lt;a href=\"nightlife\"&gt;nightlife&lt;/a&gt; (the other being &lt;a href=\"Sternschanze\"&gt;Sternschanze&lt;/a&gt;) and also the city's major &lt;a href=\"red-light%20district\"&gt;red-light district&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, it is also nicknamed \"die s\u00fcndigste Meile\" (the most sinful mile) and \"&lt;a href=\"Kiez\"&gt;Kiez&lt;/a&gt;\". The Reeperbahn Festival is among the largest club festivals.\nName and history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"street%20name\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt; \"Reeperbahn\" means &lt;a href=\"ropewalk\"&gt;ropewalk&lt;/a&gt;, which is a place where ropes are made (&lt;a href=\"Low%20German\"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt; \"Reep\" = rope, the standard German word is \"Seil\"; \"Bahn\" = track). Until the 1620s Hamburg's ropewalks had been located in the &lt;a href=\"Neustadt%2C%20Hamburg\"&gt;Neustadt&lt;/a&gt; (New Town) quarter of the inner city close to the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt;, which then became a densely built up area. Therefore, the ropewalks \"had to be relocated outside the city walls on the country road leading toward &lt;a href=\"Altona%2C%20Hamburg\"&gt;Altona&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which later took on the street name 'Reperbahn'.\" The street was a ropewalk in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe street and its side streets.\nThe street is lined with &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"night%20club\"&gt;night club&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"discotheque\"&gt;discotheque&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28establishment%29\"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt;. There are also &lt;a href=\"strip%20club\"&gt;strip club&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sex%20shop\"&gt;sex shop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"brothel\"&gt;brothel&lt;/a&gt;s and similar businesses. Between 1997 and 2007 the &lt;a href=\"Erotic%20Art%20Museum%20%28Hamburg%29\"&gt;Erotic Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; was open on Nobistor, a street running between the Reeperbahn and \"Louise-Schroeder-Stra\u00dfe\".\nThe \"\", a &lt;a href=\"musical%20theatre\"&gt;musical theatre&lt;/a&gt;, is also located at the Reeperbahn. It played &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber\"&gt;Andrew Lloyd Webber&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Cats%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt;\" for many years, after that \"&lt;a href=\"Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Mamma Mia!&lt;/a&gt;\", an &lt;a href=\"ABBA\"&gt;ABBA&lt;/a&gt;-musical, followed by \"\", (\"I have never been to New York\") featuring hit songs by Austrian singer/songwriter &lt;a href=\"Udo%20J%C3%BCrgens\"&gt;Udo J\u00fcrgens&lt;/a&gt;, then Sister Act and finally Rocky, based on the &lt;a href=\"Stallone\"&gt;Stallone&lt;/a&gt; film. There are other theatres at the Reeperbahn (&lt;a href=\"St.%20Pauli%20Theater\"&gt;St. Pauli Theater&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial Theater, &lt;a href=\"Schmidt%20Theater\"&gt;Schmidt's Tivoli&lt;/a&gt;) and also several &lt;a href=\"Cabarets\"&gt;Cabarets&lt;/a&gt;/Variet\u00e9s.\nA famous landmark is the &lt;a href=\"Davidwache\"&gt;Davidwache&lt;/a&gt;, a police station located on the South side of the Reeperbahn at the cross street '. &lt;a href=\"prostitution\"&gt;Street prostitution&lt;/a&gt; is legal during certain times of the day on '. The \"&lt;a href=\"Herbertstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Herbertstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\", a short side street off the \"Davidstra\u00dfe\", has sex workers &lt;a href=\"Window%20prostitution\"&gt;displaying themselves behind windows&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for customers. Since 1933, large screens block the view into Herbertstra\u00dfe from the adjacent streets. Since the 1970s, there have been signs saying that entrance to the street is prohibited for women and juveniles; however, it is a public road which anyone may enter. Many pubs, and street-based sex workers, can be found on the square of &lt;a href=\"Hans-Albers-Platz\"&gt;Hans-Albers-Platz&lt;/a&gt; south of the Reeperbahn.\nThe \"\" (\"Great Freedom\") is a cross street on the North Side with several bars, clubs and a Catholic church. In former years, several sex theatres here (\"Salambo\", \"Regina\", \"Colibri\", \"Safari\") would show live &lt;a href=\"sex%20show\"&gt;sex acts on stage&lt;/a&gt;. , until its closure in 2013, the \"Safari\" was the only live sex theatre left in Germany. The popular &lt;a href=\"table%20dance\"&gt;table dance&lt;/a&gt; club \"Dollhouse\" now takes the place of the \"Salambo\". \"&lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Luxor\"&gt;Hotel Luxor&lt;/a&gt;\", Hamburg's oldest brothel that had operated on this street for 60 years, was closed in 2008. The street's name comes from the fact that Catholics were allowed to practise their religion here at a time when this district did not yet belong to Hamburg; they were forbidden from doing so in Protestant Hamburg proper.\nIn 1967, Europe's largest brothel at the time, the six-floor \"Eros Center\", was opened on the Reeperbahn. It was closed in the late 1980s amidst the &lt;a href=\"AIDS\"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; scare.\nAt a major trial during 2006 and 2007 ten members of the \"Marek Gang\", which controls brothels on and near the Reeperbahn, were charged with &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt;ing. The judge rejected the charge of forming a criminal gang and handed out suspended sentences: the men had started relationships with young women in local discotheques in order to recruit them to work in their brothels, an illegal practice if the women are under 21 years of age; some men had also abused some of the women who worked for them.\nBecause of the problems with the high &lt;a href=\"crime%20rate\"&gt;crime rate&lt;/a&gt;, in 2007 the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Hamburg\"&gt;Senate of Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; enacted a ban on weapons in the Reeperbahn area. The only other such area with a weapons ban in Hamburg is the \"\", &lt;a href=\"St.%20Georg%2C%20Hamburg\"&gt;St. Georg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"St Pauli Preservation Society\" decries the ongoing &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;gentrification&lt;/a&gt; of the area. Several old-timers blamed the decline of the Reeperbahn's &lt;a href=\"sex%20industry\"&gt;sex industry&lt;/a&gt; on the rise of discotheques and cheap bars that attract teenage customers. In 2013, the &lt;a href=\"Dancing%20Towers\"&gt;Dancing Towers&lt;/a&gt; were built at the eastern end of Reeperbahn, symbolizing a couple dancing &lt;a href=\"tango\"&gt;tango&lt;/a&gt;. The increasing number of these and other modern buildings erected at the Reeperbahn attracted criticism by some St. Pauli inhabitants.\nThe Reeperbahn was hit hard by the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Almost everything had to close.\nThe Beatles.\nIn the early 1960s, &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; (who had not yet become world-famous) played in several clubs around the Reeperbahn, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Star-Club\"&gt;Star-Club&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Kaiserkeller\"&gt;Kaiserkeller&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20Ten%20Club\"&gt;Top Ten&lt;/a&gt;\" (Reeperbahn 136) and \"Indra\". Stories about the band's residencies, onstage and offstage antics are legendary; some stories are true (&lt;a href=\"John%20Lennon\"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; played a song set with a &lt;a href=\"toilet%20seat\"&gt;toilet seat&lt;/a&gt; around his neck), others inflated (the band urinating in an alley as &lt;a href=\"nun\"&gt;nun&lt;/a&gt;s walked past was told rather differently later). A fellow musician, &lt;a href=\"Kingsize%20Taylor\"&gt;Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, made a crude &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20tape\"&gt;tape recording&lt;/a&gt; of their last &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Eve\"&gt;New Year's Eve&lt;/a&gt; show, at the Star-Club in December 1962; a cleaned-up version of the tape was later released as an album, later characterized by Harrison as \"awful\".\nFamously John Lennon is quoted: \"I might have been born in &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 but I grew up in Hamburg\".\nIn memory of this time a \"&lt;a href=\"Beatles-Platz\"&gt;Beatles-Platz&lt;/a&gt;\" was built at the cross of Reeperbahn and Gro\u00dfe Freiheit.\nPopular culture.\nThe popular 1944 movie \"&lt;a href=\"Gro%C3%9Fe%20Freiheit%20Nr.%207\"&gt;Gro\u00dfe Freiheit Nr. 7&lt;/a&gt;\" tells the story of a singer (played by &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Albers\"&gt;Hans Albers&lt;/a&gt;) who works in a Reeperbahn club and falls in love with a girl played by &lt;a href=\"Ilse%20Werner\"&gt;Ilse Werner&lt;/a&gt;. Hans Albers and &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20R%C3%BChmann\"&gt;Heinz R\u00fchmann&lt;/a&gt; played in the 1954 movie \"Auf der Reeperbahn nachts um halb eins\" (\"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Reeperbahn%20at%20Half%20Past%20Midnight%20%281954%20film%29\"&gt;On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight&lt;/a&gt;\", after a &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Reeperbahn%20at%20Half%20Past%20Midnight%20%28song%29\"&gt;song of the same name&lt;/a&gt; sung by Albers in the 1944 film).\nIn 1958, &lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"Calypso%20music\"&gt;calypso&lt;/a&gt; artiste, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Invader\"&gt;Lord Invader&lt;/a&gt; recorded a track titled \"My Experience On The Reeperbahn\". It recalls a time when he was conned by a transvestite. \"You cannot tell a man from a woman. I was a man dancing hand in hand with a man dressed as woman on the Reeperbahn\". \"Reeperbahn\" is a 1978 song by &lt;a href=\"Udo%20Lindenberg\"&gt;Udo Lindenberg&lt;/a&gt;, to the tune of &lt;a href=\"Penny%20Lane\"&gt;Penny Lane&lt;/a&gt;, lamenting the decay of the entertainment there.\nIn the 1965 film &lt;a href=\"Ship%20of%20Fools\"&gt;Ship of Fools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Ferrer\"&gt;Jose Ferrer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christiane%20Schmidtmer\"&gt;Christiane Schmidtmer&lt;/a&gt; sang \"Heute Abend Geh'n Wir Bummeln Auf Der Reeperbahn.\" (Tonight We Will Go Strolling on The Reeperbahn)\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Police\"&gt;The Police&lt;/a&gt; song \"Low Life\" is about the Reeperbahn.\n&lt;a href=\"Randy%20Pie\"&gt;Randy Pie&lt;/a&gt; 1975 song \"Kitsch\" is about a curiosity shop on the Reeperbahn \u2013 the group hailed from Hamburg.\nReeperbahn is the name of a 1980s Swedish band. Finnish artist &lt;a href=\"Irwin%20Goodman\"&gt;Irwin Goodman&lt;/a&gt; has made a song and an album called \"St.Pauli ja Reeperbahn\". The street is also mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Costello\"&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt; song \"Human Hands\", in &lt;a href=\"Van%20Morrison\"&gt;Van Morrison&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"Heavy Connection\", in &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Kelly%20%28Australian%20musician%29\"&gt;Paul Kelly&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"Every Fucking City\", in the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Oil\"&gt;Midnight Oil&lt;/a&gt; song \"Mountains of Burma\", the &lt;a href=\"Sloppy%20Seconds\"&gt;Sloppy Seconds&lt;/a&gt; song \"Germany\" from their album \"&lt;a href=\"Destroyed%20%28Sloppy%20Seconds%20album%29\"&gt;Destroyed&lt;/a&gt;\" and in the &lt;a href=\"Runrig\"&gt;Runrig&lt;/a&gt; song \"Song of the Earth\".

(The English translation is entitled \"Rain\").\n&lt;a href=\"Tom%20Waits\"&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt;' 2002 release \"&lt;a href=\"Alice%20%28Tom%20Waits%20album%29\"&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;\" contains a track called \"Reeperbahn\".\nDutch DJ and producer &lt;a href=\"Nicky%20Romero\"&gt;Nicky Romero&lt;/a&gt; had the music video for his song \"&lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20%28song%29\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;\" shot in Hamburg, Germany.
