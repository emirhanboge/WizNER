In an attempt to warn, Cdr. Tasnim broke the radio silence and dispatched a message that was immediately identified, leading the Indian Navy dispatching two &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20warfare\"&gt;ASW warships&lt;/a&gt;, and INS \"Kirpan\" from &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28naval%29\"&gt;14th Squadron&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Naval%20Command\"&gt;Western Naval Command&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Navy\"&gt;Indian Navy&lt;/a&gt;.

The first &lt;a href=\"homing%20torpedo\"&gt;homing torpedo&lt;/a&gt; did not target its ship which was aimed at \"Kirpan\", and immediately opted a quick solution, firing second &lt;a href=\"homing%20torpedo\"&gt;homing torpedo&lt;/a&gt; that hit the magazine of the \"Khukri\". The crew of \"Hangor\" heard a loud explosion and began recording the orders being passed by Captain &lt;a href=\"Mahendra%20Nath%20Mulla\"&gt;M.N. Mullah&lt;/a&gt;; a third homing torpedo was also fired but \"Kirpan\" fled the scene. \"Khukri\" sank quickly before \"Hangor\" could make an attempt to save the survivors, losing 250 men in this action including Captain M.N. Mullah.\nFor almost a week, Cdr. Tasnim had the \"Hangor\" submerged due to being aware of massive search and destroy mission to locate \"Hangor\", making his way to report back to its base with depleted &lt;a href=\"Nickel%E2%80%93hydrogen%20battery\"&gt;hydrogen batteries&lt;/a&gt;.
