It is also possible to climb the peak from &lt;a href=\"Delatite%20River\"&gt;Delatite River&lt;/a&gt; level along the Klingsporn walking track.

Mclaughlin Spur offers good views to the summit fire tower and the rocky outcrops that must be traversed. At the summit there is a stone distance dial and a fire tower that is manned during the summer months.\nResort.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Buller%20Alpine%20Resort\"&gt;Mount Buller Alpine Resort&lt;/a&gt; is a popular destination in winter for skiers and snowboarders of all abilities who wish to attend for the day.
