    "text": "Hugo Hern\u00e1n Maradona (9 May 1969 \u2013 28 December 2021), also known as El Turco, was an Argentine &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach. He was the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;. He played as a &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; for clubs in South America, Europe, Japan, and Canada, and was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20under-17%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina U-16 national team&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nIn 1985, Maradona was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20under-17%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina U-16 national team&lt;/a&gt;'s squad that competed at the U16 &lt;a href=\"1985%20FIFA%20U-16%20World%20Championship\"&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1985%20South%20American%20U-16%20Championship\"&gt;World Championship&lt;/a&gt;s in China. In Argentina's first round match against &lt;a href=\"Congo%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;, he scored two goals to help the team to a 4\u20132 win, which however was one goal short of what Argentina needed to advance past the group stage.\nDuring 1987, Hugo Maradona was bought by &lt;a href=\"Ascoli%20Calcio\"&gt;Ascoli&lt;/a&gt; to play in the Italian Serie A championship. He played just 13 matches without scoring a &lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sport%29\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt;, and was sold at the end of the season to &lt;a href=\"Rayo%20Vallecano\"&gt;Rayo Vallecano&lt;/a&gt; in Spain. During 1989 he moved again, that time to &lt;a href=\"SK%20Rapid%20Wien\"&gt;Rapid Wien&lt;/a&gt;, and after that experience he went back to Argentina. \nIn 1992, he moved to Japan to play for &lt;a href=\"Tosu%20Futures\"&gt;PJM Futures&lt;/a&gt; (renamed as Tosu Futures after changing their hometown in 1994), which was aiming to promote to inaugurated &lt;a href=\"J.%20League\"&gt;J. League&lt;/a&gt;. After playing for Futures for three seasons, he played for &lt;a href=\"Avispa%20Fukuoka\"&gt;Fukuoka Blux(renamed as Avispa Fukuoka after their promotion to J. League in 1996)&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 and 1996 seasons, and &lt;a href=\"Consadole%20Sapporo\"&gt;Consadole Sapporo&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and 1998 seasons. He played in the &lt;a href=\"J1%20League\"&gt;J1 League&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and 1998.\nAfter retiring from association football as a player, Maradona lived a relatively quiet life in Argentina.\nIn 2004, Hugo Maradona moved part-time to Puerto Rico, where he became part of that country's association football federation's attempt to invigorate the sport among Puerto Ricans by becoming the head coach of the &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico%20Islanders\"&gt;Puerto Rico Islanders&lt;/a&gt;, a team in the American &lt;a href=\"USL%20First%20Division\"&gt;USL First Division&lt;/a&gt;. He then moved back to Italy, working for a number of youth and amateur teams in the &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; region.\nPersonal life and death.\nMaradona was born in &lt;a href=\"Lan%C3%BAs\"&gt;Lan\u00fas&lt;/a&gt; on 9 May 1969, as the youngest sibling of brothers &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra%C3%BAl%20Maradona\"&gt;Ra\u00fal Maradona&lt;/a&gt;, both noted footballers in their own right. His father Diego Maradona \"Chitoro\" (1927\u20132015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of &lt;a href=\"Guaran%C3%AD%20people\"&gt;Guaran\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; (Indigenous) and &lt;a href=\"Galician%20Argentines\"&gt;Galician&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Argentines\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;) descent, and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco, \"Do\u00f1a Tota\" (1930\u20132011), was of &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Argentines\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; descent.\nHe died from a heart attack at his home in &lt;a href=\"Monte%20di%20Procida\"&gt;Monte di Procida&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, on 28 December 2021, at the age of 52."
