    "text": "The Landing Craft, Support (Large) were two distinct classes of &lt;a href=\"amphibious%20warfare%20ship\"&gt;amphibious warfare vessels&lt;/a&gt; were used by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; (USN) in Pacific and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The USN versions which were later reclassified Landing Ship Support, Large also performed &lt;a href=\"radar%20picket\"&gt;radar picket&lt;/a&gt; duty and fire fighting.\nUS Navy Vessels.\nThe original designation for the ships was LCS(L)(3), which stood for \"Landing Craft Support (Large) Mark 3\". In 1949 the class was reclassified to \"Landing Ship Support, Large\" (LSSL). The United States Navy had to have the designation LCS(L) because there was also a smaller class named LCL, that were built mainly for rescue and smoke laying during amphibious operation.\nDesign and manufacture.\nA total of 130 were made. Three different ship building yards did the construction: &lt;a href=\"George%20Lawley%20%26amp%3B%20Son\"&gt;George Lawley &amp; Son&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dorchester%2C%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Neponset, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20Iron%20Works\"&gt;Commercial Iron Works&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;); and &lt;a href=\"Albina%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Albina&lt;/a&gt; Engine Works (Portland, Oregon).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; was the same as the &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Craft%20Infantry\"&gt;Landing Craft Infantry&lt;/a&gt; ships. They were long, &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; , wide and drew when fully loaded. The flat bottom and &lt;a href=\"skeg\"&gt;skeg&lt;/a&gt;s between and on either side of the twin screws allowed the ships to safely beach. The anchor is at the stern of the ship so it can be used to help pull the ship off the beach if necessary. The twin variable pitch screws were each driven by a bank of four Grey Marine (later &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;) diesel engines, with a total power for all eight engines of . These engines gave a maximum speed of , but normally the ships sailed at . The ships had a range of . Armour for the gun mounts, pilot house and conning tower was provided by STS splinter shields. The ships had a smoke generator which was used to obscure landing craft approaching the beach.\nLCS(L) vessels could be produced in as little as 10 days, and final fitting out would take a further few weeks. The ships also made very good &lt;a href=\"Fireboat\"&gt;fire fighting ships&lt;/a&gt;. A fire fighting manifold was fitted in front of the bow gun and two monitors with pumps fitted just forward of the aft gun.\nArmament.\nThe LCS(L)(3) ships provided more firepower per ton than any ship ever built for the USN. Three guns and ten rocket launchers comprised the main armament. The bow gun was a &lt;a href=\"3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun\"&gt;3\"/50 caliber gun&lt;/a&gt;, a single &lt;a href=\"Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun\"&gt;40 mm gun&lt;/a&gt; or a twin 40\u00a0mm gun. The forward and aft deck guns were twin 40\u00a0mm guns. The ten Mark 7 rocket launchers were situated behind the bow gun and forward deck house. Four &lt;a href=\"Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon\"&gt;20 mm cannons&lt;/a&gt; were also mounted.\nOperations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tarawa\"&gt;Battle of Tarawa&lt;/a&gt; showed a gap in Navy resources for close in support of landing troops. The time interval between the end of shelling from the large ships and the arrival of the landing craft on the beach allowed the defenders to regroup. The Landing Craft Support was designed to fill this void.\nThe first Landing Craft Support ships arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20War\"&gt;Pacific Theater&lt;/a&gt; in time for the landings at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima\"&gt;Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter providing close in support during the landings at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, many Landing Craft Support ships were placed on the radar picket stations as anti-aircraft platforms. When not on a picket stations, the ship would create smoke to hide the fleet at anchor and perform \"skunk patrol\" screening for suicide boats.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Borneo%20Campaign%20%281945%29\"&gt;Borneo Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Landing Craft Support was used in landings in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29\"&gt;Tarakan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29\"&gt;Balikpapan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring World War II, five LCS(L)(3)s were sunk in combat (see below) and 21 were damaged. Three of these small warships received Presidential Unit Citations, while six were awarded Navy Unit citations. Importantly, Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Miles%20McCool\"&gt;Richard M. McCool&lt;/a&gt;, skipper of USS \"LCS(L)(3) 122\", was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\"LCS(L)(3)-7\", \"LCS(L)(3)-26\" and \"LCS(L)(3)-49\" were sunk by suicide boats off Mariveles, Corregidor Channel, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 16 February 1945. \"LCS(L)(3)-15\" was sunk by kamikaze aircraft off Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, on 22 April 1945. \"LCS(L)(3)-33\" was sunk by a kamikaze on 12 April 1945 at RP position No1. &lt;NHHC , Action Report)ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPost war.\nAt the end of the war, surviving ships returned to the United States. Some were restored to action for the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;. Many were transferred to Japan, France (and on to South Vietnam), Cambodia, Thailand, Greece, and other nations.\nOnly two ships are known to still exist. One has been highly modified as a fishing boat. The second was in Thailand and was kept in very similar configuration to its original (HTMS \"Nakha\", formerly USS \"LCS(L)-102)\". The National Association of USS LCS(L) 1\u2013130 was successful in having HTMS \"Nakha\" transferred to the association for public display in the United States. She was officially released from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Thai%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Thai Navy&lt;/a&gt; on November 10, 2007 after being returned to the US in September of that year. As of May 2017 &lt;a href=\"USS%20LCS%28L%29%283%29-102\"&gt;USS LCS(L)-102&lt;/a&gt; is under restoration and upkeep. It is open to the public on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or by special arrangements, and tours at the former Naval Ship yard, Mare Island, in &lt;a href=\"Vallejo%2C%20California\"&gt;Vallejo, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nBritish LCS vessels.\nThe British designed, built and operated ten &lt;a href=\"Fairmile%20H%20landing%20craft\"&gt;Fairmile Type H&lt;/a&gt; LCS vessels. Three of these were sunk in action."
