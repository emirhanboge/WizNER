    "title": "Bin-fed batching plant",
    "text": "Bin-fed concrete batching plants are used to store all the ingredients needed to mix &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;. The batch plants are fully transportable, fully automated, have their own &lt;a href=\"hydraulics\"&gt;hydraulic&lt;/a&gt; off-loading legs and are capable of producing outputs of up to 80 &lt;a href=\"cubic%20meter\"&gt;m3&lt;/a&gt; per hour. The compact and easy-to-use design of some bin-fed batch plant models ensures they can be up and working within just an hour of arrival on site. Four off-loading legs enable the bin-fed batching plant to be loaded and unloaded from a &lt;a href=\"truck\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; without the use of a &lt;a href=\"Crane%20%28machine%29\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt;. During transportation the legs retract into the frame of the batching plant and during off-loading they open out into a width that allows the truck to drive away or move back underneath.\nEach unit has a &lt;a href=\"conveyor%20belt\"&gt;conveyor belt&lt;/a&gt; to lift the raw materials, which folds away into the first &lt;a href=\"aggregate%20%28composite%29\"&gt;aggregate&lt;/a&gt; bin. Bin-fed batch plants are fitted with load cells and digital display units with printers to enable constant control of raw materials. The unit is supplied cement from a Cement Silo, normally between the capacity of 30-100MT. Since these are much smaller batching plants, great care should be taken to ensure &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.maaps.us/what-causes-cement-silo-failure/\"&gt;safety of the Cement Silos&lt;/a&gt;. Since Silos are top heavy structures, care is taken to ensure proper foundations of these silos. "
