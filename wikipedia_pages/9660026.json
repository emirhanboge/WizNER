    "text": "Kamranieh (also spelled Kamraniyeh) (, also &lt;a href=\"Romanized\"&gt;Romanized&lt;/a&gt; as \"k\u0101mr\u0101n\u012byeh\") is an affluent and luxury neighbourhood located in one of the northernmost parts of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Tehran\"&gt;Greater Tehran&lt;/a&gt; in the area called &lt;a href=\"Shemiran\"&gt;Shemiran&lt;/a&gt;, on the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Alborz\"&gt;Alborz mountain range&lt;/a&gt;. Kamranieh is known for its luxurious &lt;a href=\"high-rise%20buildings\"&gt;high-rise buildings&lt;/a&gt;, costly &lt;a href=\"apartments\"&gt;apartments&lt;/a&gt; and massive &lt;a href=\"mansions\"&gt;mansions&lt;/a&gt;. Centered on Kamranieh street, the neighborhood lies within &lt;a href=\"Shemiranat%20County\"&gt;Shemiranat County&lt;/a&gt; and district one of Tehran municipality.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Farmanieh\"&gt;Farmanieh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niavaran\"&gt;Niavaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zafaraniyeh\"&gt;Zafaraniyeh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elahieh\"&gt;Elahieh&lt;/a&gt;, it is now home to the most expensive real estate in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the home to many Iranian nobles and notables as well as &lt;a href=\"embassies\"&gt;embassies&lt;/a&gt; and foreign officials.\nThe name of Kamranieh is based on the son of &lt;a href=\"Naser-al-din%20Shah\"&gt;Naser-al-din Shah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kamran%20Mirza%20Nayeb%20es-Saltaneh\"&gt;Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh&lt;/a&gt;, who used to own much of the land in the area. Kamranieh was one of the first neighbourhoods in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; that was equipped with a telephone system.\nIn addition, the first pet hospital of &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, Tehran Pet hospital, was established in this neighbourhood in 2004.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1800s, &lt;a href=\"Kamran%20Mirza%20Nayeb%20es-Saltaneh\"&gt;Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Naser%20al-Din%20Shah%20Qajar\"&gt;Naser al-Din Shah Qajar&lt;/a&gt;, grabbed the lands of Kamranieh from the locals who used to farm in the area. Afterwards, he ordered to build a fabulous garden instead of the farmlands and then named it Kamranieh which means \"the estate belongs to Kamran\". Kamranieh garden featured a large variety of plants and a &lt;a href=\"greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt; to protect sensitive flowers inside it in winter. In audition, two &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n gardeners were hired to protect the garden all the time.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kamran%20Mirza%20Nayeb%20es-Saltaneh\"&gt;Kamran Mirza&lt;/a&gt;'s death in 1929, his children gradually sold the lands of Kamranieh garden to wealthy residents of &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. The new owners built themselves &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;s in order to use them as &lt;a href=\"summer%20houses\"&gt;summer houses&lt;/a&gt;. Today however most of the gardens have been replaced by residential towers and newbuild apartments, few of them have actually escaped development.\nLocation.\nKamranieh touches &lt;a href=\"Niavaran\"&gt;Niavaran&lt;/a&gt; on the north, &lt;a href=\"Sadr%20Expressway\"&gt;Sadr Expressway&lt;/a&gt; on the south and &lt;a href=\"Farmanieh\"&gt;Farmanieh&lt;/a&gt; on the east and west. Kamranieh has two segments named South Kamranieh and North Kamranieh. South Kamranieh is below Kamranieh junction and North Kamranieh is located upon the junction. Kamranieh junction is the point where Kamranieh street, Farmanieh street and Andarzgoo Boulevard join each other.\nWeather.\nKamranieh lies on the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Alborz%20Mountains\"&gt;Alborz Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and enjoys a suitable mild climate."
