    "text": "Ian Clarke is a physician, &lt;a href=\"missionary\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philanthropist\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"entrepreneur\"&gt;entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;, and politician in &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;. Since May 2011, he has been &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Makindye%20Division\"&gt;Makindye Division&lt;/a&gt;, one of the five administrative units of the &lt;a href=\"Kampala%20Capital%20City%20Authority\"&gt;Kampala Capital City Authority&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground and education.\nClarke was born in &lt;a href=\"County%20Armagh\"&gt;South Armagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1952 to Thomas and Jean Clarke. He studied human medicine at &lt;a href=\"Queens%20University%20Belfast\"&gt;Queens University Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1976 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Bachelor%20of%20Surgery\"&gt;Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery&lt;/a&gt; and a Bachelor of &lt;a href=\"Obstetrics\"&gt;Obstetrics&lt;/a&gt;, as is customary in Irish medical schools. In 1987, he obtained a &lt;a href=\"Diploma%20in%20Tropical%20Medicine%20and%20Hygiene\"&gt;Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20School%20of%20Tropical%20Medicine\"&gt;Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (LSTM). He followed up in 1994 with a Master of Science in &lt;a href=\"Public%20health\"&gt;Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, also from LSTM.\nMoved to Uganda.\nClarke read about the &lt;a href=\"AIDS\"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; epidemic in Uganda and decided to come see for himself. He was taken to Kiwoko Village in present-day &lt;a href=\"Nakaseke%20District\"&gt;Nakaseke District&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Luweero%20triangle\"&gt;Luweero Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived in 1987, at the tail end of the &lt;a href=\"Ugandan%20Bush%20War\"&gt;Ugandan Bush War&lt;/a&gt;, which he had been unaware of until he arrived. He subsequently returned with his family under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Mission%20Society\"&gt;Church Mission Society&lt;/a&gt; to work in Kiwoko. Clarke initially treated his patients under a tree before going on to establish &lt;a href=\"Kiwoko%20Hospital\"&gt;Kiwoko Hospital&lt;/a&gt; which, as of March 2015, maintained a nurses training school, a laboratory technician training school, a large community health programme, a neonatal ICU, and full general hospital facilities.\nClarke later moved to Kampala, setting up his first clinic (International Medical Centre) within the Kampala Pentecostal Church Building (Watoto Church) on Buganda Road in Central Kampala. His vision continued to grow and he subsequently opened &lt;a href=\"International%20Hospital%20Kampala\"&gt;International Hospital Kampala&lt;/a&gt; (IHK) in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kampala\"&gt;Old Kampala&lt;/a&gt; where the first open heart surgery was carried out. IHK subsequently grew and moved to &lt;a href=\"Namuwongo\"&gt;Namuwongo&lt;/a&gt;, another Kampala suburb. The 110 bed facility is the only ISO certified hospital in Uganda and strives to continue bridging the gap in private healthcare provision in Uganda through providing quality, affordable healthcare. The hospital has state-of-the-art facilities including specialties such as obstetrics and &lt;a href=\"gynecology\"&gt;gynecology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pediatrics\"&gt;pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"plastic%20surgery\"&gt;plastic surgery&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther responsibilities.\nClarke also writes a weekly column in \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Vision\"&gt;The New Vision&lt;/a&gt;\", Uganda's biggest daily, and has penned two books entitled \"The Man With The Key Has Gone\" and \"How Deep Is This Pothole\". He has further projects in &lt;a href=\"Juba%2C%20South%20Sudan\"&gt;Juba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Zanzibar\"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; where his family built, owns, and operates a boutique hotel. His wife Roberta Clarke, lives with him in Kampala. Their oldest son Sean oversees the approximately 12 clinics that his father owns in Uganda. Their daughter Lauren is a nurse and lives in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Their youngest son Michael runs the family hotel in Zanzibar.\nPolitical career.\nIn November 2010, Clarke entered Ugandan politics by securing nomination, as an independent candidate, to contest for the chairmanship of Makindye Division, one of the five divisions of the &lt;a href=\"Kampala%20Capital%20City%20Authority\"&gt;Kampala Capital City Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the governing body of Uganda's capital city of &lt;a href=\"Kampala\"&gt;Kampala&lt;/a&gt;. He was motivated to run due to the bad roads and poor living conditions within his community. His three pillars in the election were: \"good roads, good health and economic development\". He enjoyed a landmark victory and was sworn into office as mayor in May 2011 to serve for a five-year term.\nAffiliated businesses.\nClarke is chairman and chief executive officer of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Medical%20Group%20%28Uganda%29\"&gt;International Medical Group&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2014, unofficial estimates put the value of Clarke's businesses at US$15 million."
