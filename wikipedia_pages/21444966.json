    "text": "The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes are a united, &lt;a href=\"Federally%20recognized%20tribes\"&gt;federally recognized&lt;/a&gt; tribe of Southern &lt;a href=\"Arapaho\"&gt;Arapaho&lt;/a&gt; and Southern &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt; people in western &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n The Cheyennes and Arapahos are two distinct tribes with distinct histories. The Cheyenne (Tsitsistas/ The People) were once agrarian, or agricultural, people located near the Great Lakes in present-day &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. Grinnell notes the Cheyenne language is a unique branch of the &lt;a href=\"Algonquian%20languages\"&gt;Algonquian language family&lt;/a&gt; and, The Nation itself, is descended from two related tribes, the Tsitsistas and the Suh' Tai. The latter is believed to have joined the Tsitsistas in the early 18th century (1: 1\u20132). The Tsitsistas and the Suh' Tai are characterized, and represented by two cultural heroes who received divine articles which shaped the time-honored belief systems of the Southern and Northern families of the Cheyenne Nation. The Suh' Tai, represented by a man named Erect Horns, were blessed with the care of a sacred Buffalo Hat, which is kept among the Northern family. The Tsitsistas, represented by a man named Sweet Medicine, were bestowed with the care of a bundle of sacred Arrows, kept among the Southern Family. Inspired by &lt;a href=\"Erect%20Horn\"&gt;Erect Horn&lt;/a&gt;'s vision, they adopted the &lt;a href=\"horse%20culture\"&gt;horse culture&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century and moved westward onto the plains to follow the &lt;a href=\"bison\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Medicine%20%28Cheyenne%29\"&gt;Sweet Medicine&lt;/a&gt; organized the structure of Cheyenne society, including the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Forty-four\"&gt;Council of Forty-four&lt;/a&gt; peace chiefs and the &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne%20military%20societies\"&gt;warrior societies&lt;/a&gt; led by prominent warriors.\nThe Arapaho, also Algonquian speaking, came from &lt;a href=\"Saskatchewan\"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wyoming\"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;, eastern &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and western &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century. They adopted horse culture and became successful nomadic hunters. In 1800, the tribe began coalescing into northern and southern groups. Although the Arapaho had assisted the &lt;a href=\"Cheyenne\"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lakota%20people\"&gt;Lakota&lt;/a&gt; in driving the &lt;a href=\"Kiowa\"&gt;Kiowa&lt;/a&gt; and Comanche south from the Northern Plains, in 1840 they made peace with both tribes. They became prosperous traders, until the expansion of American settlers onto their lands after the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cheyenne and Arapaho formed an alliance in the 18th and 19th centuries. Together they were a formidable military force, successful hunters, and active traders with other tribes. At the height of their alliance, their combined hunting territories spanned from &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arapaho signed the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Laramie%20Treaty%20%281851%29\"&gt;Fort Laramie Treaty&lt;/a&gt; with the U.S. in 1851. It recognized and guaranteed their rights to traditional lands in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The U.S. could not enforce the treaty, however, and European-American trespassers overran Indian lands. There were repeated conflicts between settlers and members of the tribes.\nThe U.S. government brought the tribes to council again in 1867 to achieve peace under the &lt;a href=\"Medicine%20Lodge%20Treaty\"&gt;Medicine Lodge Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. It promised the Arapaho a reservation in &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, but they disliked the location. They accepted a reservation with the Cheyenne in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Territory\"&gt;Indian Territory&lt;/a&gt;, so both tribes were forced to remove south near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Reno%20%28Oklahoma%29\"&gt;Fort Reno&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Darlington%20Agency\"&gt;Darlington Agency&lt;/a&gt; in present-day Oklahoma.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dawes%20Act\"&gt;Dawes Act&lt;/a&gt; broke up the Cheyenne-Arapaho land base. All land not allotted to individual Indians was opened to settlement in the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Run\"&gt;Land Run&lt;/a&gt; of 1892. The &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Act%20of%201898\"&gt;Curtis Act of 1898&lt;/a&gt; dismantled the tribal governments in an attempt to have the tribal members assimilate to United States conventions and culture.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Indian%20Welfare%20Act\"&gt;Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act&lt;/a&gt; passed in 1936, the Cheyenne and Arapaho organized a single tribal government in 1937. The &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Self-Determination%20and%20Education%20Assistance%20Act%20of%201975\"&gt;Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975&lt;/a&gt; further enhanced tribal development.\nEconomic development.\nThe tribe operates three tribal smoke shops and five casinos: the Lucky Star Casino in &lt;a href=\"Clinton%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, the Lucky Star Casino in Concho, the Lucky Star Casino in &lt;a href=\"Watonga%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Watonga&lt;/a&gt;, the Lucky Star Casino in Hammon, and the Lucky Star Casino in &lt;a href=\"Canton%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt;. They also issue their own tribal vehicle tags. Their economic impact is estimated at $32 million.\nGovernment.\nThe Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes are headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Concho%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Concho, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Of 12,185 enrolled tribal members, 8,664 live within the state of Oklahoma. The tribal jurisdictional area includes &lt;a href=\"Beckham%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Beckham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Blaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Custer%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Custer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dewey%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Dewey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingfisher%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Kingfisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Mills%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Roger Mills&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Washita%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Washita Counties&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tribal government consists of the Tribal Council, Executive Branch, Legislative Branch, and Judicial Branch. The Tribal Council includes all tribal members over the age of 18. The Executive Branch is led by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The Legislative Branch is made up of legislators from the four Arapaho districts and four Cheyenne districts. The Judicial Branch includes a Supreme Court, including one Chief Justice and four Associate Justices; a Trial Court, composed of one Chief Judge and at least one Associate Judge; and any lower courts deemed necessary by the Legislature. In 2006 the tribes voted and ratified the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes Constitution which replaced the 1975 constitution.\nInstitutions.\n\"The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Tribune\" is the tribe's newspaper. \"CATV channel 47\" is the tribe's low power FCC licensed television station. CATV's call letters are K47MU-D. The Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma Culture and Heritage Program teaches &lt;a href=\"Handgame\"&gt;hand games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"powwow\"&gt;powwow&lt;/a&gt; dancing and songs, horse care and riding, buffalo management, and Cheyenne and Arapaho language, and sponsored several running events.\nCollege.\nIn partnership with &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20Oklahoma%20State%20University\"&gt;Southwestern Oklahoma State University&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe founded the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal College on August 25, 2006. &lt;a href=\"Henrietta%20Mann\"&gt;Henrietta Mann&lt;/a&gt;, enrolled tribal member, was president in 2009. The campus was in &lt;a href=\"Weatherford%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Weatherford, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and the school offered programs in Tribal Administration, American Indian Studies, and General Studies. The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal College Board of Regents voted to dissolve the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal College at the end of the 2015 spring semester. However, in September of 2019 the tribe developed a replacement by chartering &lt;a href=\"Bacone%20College\"&gt;Bacone College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Muskogee%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Muskogee, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; as its school.\nBuffalo program.\nFor cultural and food sovereignty purposes, a buffalo herd has been established. The herd expanded to 530 bison in 2021 when Denver Parks and Recreation donated 13 animals which will improve the herd's genetic diversity. Bison is the correct taxonomic term for &lt;a href=\"Bison%20bison\"&gt;Bison bison&lt;/a&gt;, but buffalo is the common vernacular term."
