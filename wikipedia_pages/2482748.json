    "text": "Silver King (January 11, 1868 \u2013 May 21, 1938), born Charles Frederick Koenig in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri, was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; player from 1886 through 1897.\nIn a 10-year career, spent primarily as a &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, King played for the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Cowboys%20%28National%20League%29\"&gt;Kansas City Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; (1886), &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns%20%28NL%29\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; (1887\u201389), &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Pirates\"&gt;Chicago Pirates&lt;/a&gt; (1890), &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; (1891), &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; (1892\u201393), &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; (1893), and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281891%E2%80%9399%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt; (1896\u201397). The first part of King's nickname was a reference to the color of his hair, while the latter part was a translation of his German &lt;a href=\"surname\"&gt;surname&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing was an unusual pitcher for his time. Gripping the ball with unusually large hands, he delivered the ball without a &lt;a href=\"Pitching%20position\"&gt;windup&lt;/a&gt;. He was also one of the first pitchers in major league history to employ a &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;sidearm&lt;/a&gt; delivery. The unconventional methods worked, as he went on to pitch 3,190 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt;, winning 203 games with 1229 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s and a 3.18 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; in 397 &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;. His strong &lt;a href=\"fastball\"&gt;fastball&lt;/a&gt; enabled him to become a notable strikeout artist; he finished among the league's top 10 in that category six times.\nKing's best season came in 1888, when he led the Browns to their fourth consecutive &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20%2819th%20century%29\"&gt;American Association&lt;/a&gt; championship. That year, King led the league with 585 innings pitched in 66 games, 45 wins, and a 1.64 ERA. In 1890, he jumped to Chicago of the &lt;a href=\"Players%27%20League\"&gt;Players' League&lt;/a&gt; and added another ERA title while winning 30 games. On June 21, 1890, King threw a &lt;a href=\"no-hitter\"&gt;no-hitter&lt;/a&gt; for Chicago, the only one in the league's one-year history. (King lost 1\u20130, and pitched only &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080526075129/http%3A//www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php%3Fyear%3D1890\"&gt;eight innings&lt;/a&gt; in the loss, so this game is not officially recognized by MLB as a no-hitter.)\nAfter baseball, King returned to his native St. Louis. He died in 1938, at age 70, and was buried at New St. Marcus Cemetery in St. Louis."
