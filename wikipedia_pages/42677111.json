The main emphasis of the party is to bring people of competence, integrity, and honesty into Pakistani politics. The founders of the party allege that all of Pakistan's travails - &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sectarian%20violence\"&gt;sectarian violence&lt;/a&gt; and lawlessness - are due to a single root cause: that the people who are now in &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s politics do not have the necessary competence, integrity, honesty and even desire to run the country.\nChairman, National Executive Committee, &amp; Presidents.\nThe party's first Chairman is Nadeem Mumtaz Qureshi, an &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; by training and a fluent &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; speaker.

The party has over 10,000 registered members and over 170,000 supporters and well-wishers on social media. The party has seen large expansion and hopes to participate in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Pakistani%20general%20election\"&gt;2018 general elections&lt;/a&gt;. Special attention is being given to remote areas of the country such as the &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;ous north of the country where the party recently opened an office in &lt;a href=\"Swat%20District\"&gt;Swat&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers and members have increased in large numbers since the formation of the party. Today MP has more than 11,000 registered members and thousands of volunteers across Pakistan. The Central office is in &lt;a href=\"Multan\"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt; and the other branch office is in &lt;a href=\"Athara%20Hazari\"&gt;Athara Hazari&lt;/a&gt;.\nWomen.\nMP includes a &lt;a href=\"Women%20in%20law\"&gt;female lawyers&lt;/a&gt; wing which &lt;a href=\"advocate\"&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rights\"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlag.\nThe blue color represents the horizon, sky, flight, vastness, and the world.\nThe white color represents peace, clarity, and brightness.\nThe triangle of white is a stars corner derived from the Pakistani Flag.\nNational Party Song.\nThe national song of the party, titled \"Waqt ki Azaan, Mustaqbil Pakistan\", was written by Naveed Ansari, in time for the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Pakistani%20general%20election\"&gt;2013 elections&lt;/a&gt; in which Mustaqbil Pakistan participated. Another song written for the party is entitled \"Mustaqbil Pakistan Ka Tum He Toh Ho.\"\nElections.\nThe 2013 elections included 22 candidates from MP, 18 for the Provincial Assembly and 5 for the National Assembly.\nIn general elections of 2018, the Chairman, Nadeem Mumtaz Qureshi contested for NA-114 and NA-156 national assembly and a further 10 candidates contested for both national and provincial assemblies.\nThe party issued tickets to only those who fulfilled and qualified MP's criteria.
