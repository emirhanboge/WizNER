    "text": "Varsity is an alteration and shortening of the term \"university\". The meaning differs depending on the region, but is usually related to sporting activity.\nVarsity in the United Kingdom.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, varsity team or varsity club refers to the groups participating in &lt;a href=\"varsity%20match\"&gt;varsity match&lt;/a&gt;es in sport or other competitions between &lt;a href=\"University%20rivalry%23United%20Kingdom\"&gt;rival universities&lt;/a&gt;. The term originally referred strictly to university-sponsored teams, and dates from the 1840s.\nIn contemporary &lt;a href=\"Scots%20language\"&gt;Scots language&lt;/a&gt; the term \"varsity\" is often interchangeable with \"university\" in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.\nVarsity in North America.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, varsity teams are the principal athletic teams representing a &lt;a href=\"college\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"university\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt;, or other &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt;. Such teams compete against similar teams at corresponding educational institutions. Groups of varsity sports teams are often organized into &lt;a href=\"athletic%20conference\"&gt;athletic conference&lt;/a&gt;s, which are groups of teams that regularly play each other during a given athletic season. In recognition of their high level of performance, athletes on varsity teams are often given &lt;a href=\"varsity%20letter\"&gt;varsity letter&lt;/a&gt;s. They are in contrast to the institution's &lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20club%20sports\"&gt;club sports&lt;/a&gt;.\nA major difference between varsity and club sports is the source for allocated funds. Varsity teams receive financial support, equipment, and facilities from college and university athletic department budgets. Universities often allocate club sport budgets through student life departments similar to other clubs on campus. Because club sports cost more than other clubs, many club student-athletes must &lt;a href=\"pay%20to%20play\"&gt;pay to play&lt;/a&gt; and also engage in team fundraising efforts to pay for facilities time, equipment, and other team expenses. At various levels of collegiate sports, varsity student athletes are eligible for &lt;a href=\"scholarships\"&gt;scholarships&lt;/a&gt; solely or partially based on athletic skills.\nVarsity can be compared with the &lt;a href=\"junior%20varsity\"&gt;junior varsity&lt;/a&gt; (JV) level, which is typically for less-experienced &lt;a href=\"underclassmen\"&gt;underclassmen&lt;/a&gt;, and also with &lt;a href=\"intramural%20sports\"&gt;intramural sports&lt;/a&gt; (IM sports), for which the teams are all within the same school (the word \"intramural\" means \"within the walls\"). JV and IM players may be able to go up to varsity level by performing well.\nVarsity in the Netherlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Varsity is the oldest and most prestigious rowing race. It was held for the first time in 1878, and was started as a Dutch equivalent for the Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge.\nVarsity in South Africa.\nIn &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and some other &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20countries\"&gt;Commonwealth countries&lt;/a&gt;, varsity is often still used in place of the word university, in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.\nVarsity in Bangladesh.\nVarsity is basically the short form of university in Bangladesh and is mostly used by the students of universities. The term is more common among the students of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20and%20towns%20in%20Bangladesh\"&gt;big cities&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chittagong\"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khulna\"&gt;Khulna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylhet\"&gt;Sylhet&lt;/a&gt; etc., though the term is now being used by the other demographics of the country as well. The term is now also widely understood by many people."
