    "text": "Skyline Drive is a road that runs the entire length of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Park%20Service\"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20National%20Park\"&gt;Shenandoah National Park&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blue Ridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, generally along the ridge of the mountains. The drive's northern terminus is at an intersection with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20340%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;U.S. Route\u00a0340&lt;/a&gt; (US\u00a0340) near &lt;a href=\"Front%20Royal%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Front Royal&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern terminus is at an interchange with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20250%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a0250&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2064%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;Interstate\u00a064&lt;/a&gt; (I-64) in &lt;a href=\"Rockfish%20Gap\"&gt;Rockfish Gap&lt;/a&gt;, where the road continues south as the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ridge%20Parkway\"&gt;Blue Ridge Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. The road has intermediate interchanges with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20211\"&gt;US\u00a0211&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Gap\"&gt;Thornton Gap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2033%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a033&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Run%20Gap\"&gt;Swift Run Gap&lt;/a&gt;. Skyline Drive is part of &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20State%20Route%2048\"&gt;Virginia State Route\u00a048&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes the Virginia portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but this designation is &lt;a href=\"unsigned%20highway\"&gt;not signed&lt;/a&gt;.\nA park entrance fee is charged at the four access points to the drive. Skyline Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20Valley\"&gt;Shenandoah Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Trail\"&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also used for &lt;a href=\"biking\"&gt;biking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"horseback%20riding\"&gt;horseback riding&lt;/a&gt;. Skyline Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to &lt;a href=\"campground\"&gt;campground&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"visitor%20center\"&gt;visitor center&lt;/a&gt;s, and resorts such as &lt;a href=\"Skyland%20Resort\"&gt;Skyland Resort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Meadows\"&gt;Big Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. The scenic drive is particularly popular in the fall for &lt;a href=\"leaf%20peeping\"&gt;leaf peeping&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Autumn%20leaf%20color\"&gt;leaves are changing colors&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlans for the road date back to 1924 when a national park was planned in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and the main feature was to be a \"sky-line drive\" providing views of the surrounding land. President &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Hoover\"&gt;Herbert Hoover&lt;/a&gt;, who had a summer home at &lt;a href=\"Rapidan%20Camp\"&gt;Rapidan Camp&lt;/a&gt;, called for the construction of the road. Groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place in 1931. The first section, which originally was to run from Rapidan Camp to Skyland, was extended between Swift Run Gap and Thornton Gap and opened in 1934. Skyline Drive was extended north to Front Royal in 1936 and south to &lt;a href=\"Jarman%20Gap\"&gt;Jarman Gap&lt;/a&gt; in 1939. The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway in 1939 and was incorporated into Skyline Drive in 1961. The &lt;a href=\"Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps\"&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps&lt;/a&gt; played a large part in constructing Skyline Drive. Improvements have been made to the roadway since it was built. Skyline Drive was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, became a &lt;a href=\"National%20Scenic%20Byway\"&gt;National Scenic Byway&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, and was designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nRoute description.\nSkyline Drive takes a winding north\u2013south path along the mountaintops of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blue Ridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; east of the &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20River\"&gt;Shenandoah River&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Front%20Royal%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Front Royal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rockfish%20Gap\"&gt;Rockfish Gap&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the only public road through &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20National%20Park\"&gt;Shenandoah National Park&lt;/a&gt;. There are four entrance points to Skyline Drive located at &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20340%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a0340&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2066\"&gt;I-66&lt;/a&gt; in Front Royal, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20211\"&gt;US\u00a0211&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Gap\"&gt;Thornton Gap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2033%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a033&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Run%20Gap\"&gt;Swift Run Gap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20250%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a0250&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2064%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;I-64&lt;/a&gt; in Rockfish Gap. At the south end in Rockfish Gap it connects to the northern terminus of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ridge%20Parkway\"&gt;Blue Ridge Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, a free-access road that continues southward along the Blue Ridge Mountains. On the west side of the drive, mileposts are present. They are numbered from 0 to 105 (north to south) and serve as reference points to directions in the drive. There are 75 overlooks throughout the drive, providing views of the &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20Valley\"&gt;Shenandoah Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nThe &lt;a href=\"speed%20limit\"&gt;speed limit&lt;/a&gt; is and is strictly enforced by park rangers. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20black%20bear\"&gt;black bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey%20%28bird%29\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Trail\"&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which follows the road's path.\n&lt;a href=\"Biking\"&gt;Biking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"horseback%20riding\"&gt;horseback riding&lt;/a&gt; are other recreational activities that are allowed on the road. The drive is popular in the fall months for &lt;a href=\"leaf%20peeping\"&gt;leaf peeping&lt;/a&gt; to view &lt;a href=\"fall%20foliage\"&gt;fall foliage&lt;/a&gt;. Skyline Drive is closed from dusk to dawn from November to early January to ensure rangers can control illegal hunting. The drive can also close for a short time following snow or ice storms. Skyline Drive is designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Scenic%20Byway\"&gt;National Scenic Byway&lt;/a&gt;.\nFront Royal to Thornton Gap.\nSkyline Drive begins at an intersection with &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20340%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;US\u00a0340&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Front%20Royal%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Front Royal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Warren%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Warren County&lt;/a&gt;, heading east into dense forests in &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20National%20Park\"&gt;Shenandoah National Park&lt;/a&gt; as a two-lane undivided road.

Fees are collected at these four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $30.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $25.00 for motorcycles and $15.00 for individuals 16 years of age or older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $55.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the &lt;a href=\"America%20the%20Beautiful%20Pass\"&gt;America the Beautiful Pass&lt;/a&gt; series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the Annual Senior Pass costs $20.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;United States Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.\nHistory.\nIn 1924, the Southern Appalachian National Park Committee was searching for a site for a national park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia that would be easily accessible from major cities on the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;East Coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and settled on the current site of Shenandoah National Park. As part of the recommendation for the park was the \"greatest single feature\" to be a \"sky-line drive\" that would provide views of the Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Piedmont to the east. The idea for the roadway was suggested by committee member William C. Gregg to Board of Shenandoah Valley, Inc. member L. Ferdinand Zerkel during a visit to Skyland. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover, who established a summer home in the area, called for the roadway to be built along the Blue Ridge Mountains. The road was proposed to be named Hoover Highway, but would instead become known as Skyline Drive.\nField survey for the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an official groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The first section of the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The &lt;a href=\"Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps\"&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps&lt;/a&gt; (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have a hand in the construction of Skyline Drive. President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes on both sides of the roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Public%20Roads\"&gt;Bureau of Public Roads&lt;/a&gt; and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.\nSkyline Drive was originally lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles in the winter and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Highway Administration&lt;/a&gt; began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States."
