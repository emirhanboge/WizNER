    "text": "Vinotonus is a god from &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20mythology\"&gt;Celtic mythology&lt;/a&gt; of which little is known. Only four altars dedicated to Vinotonus have been found all of which are located near the &lt;a href=\"Castra\"&gt;Roman fort&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bowes\"&gt;Bowes&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Romans&lt;/a&gt; found Vinotonus to be equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Silvanus%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Silvanus&lt;/a&gt;, the god of agriculture, and that he was a wilderness god. It was common for the Romans to assign the names of popular Roman gods to local Celtic deities as Silvanus was also equated with the Celtic god &lt;a href=\"Cocidius\"&gt;Cocidius&lt;/a&gt;."
