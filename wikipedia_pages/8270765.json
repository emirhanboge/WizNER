    "text": "Sumas Mountain is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Whatcom%20County%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Whatcom County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, 15 miles northeast of &lt;a href=\"Bellingham%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Bellingham&lt;/a&gt; and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Vedder%20Mountain\"&gt;Vedder Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Skagit%20Range\"&gt;Skagit Range&lt;/a&gt;, the mountain is notable for its high &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; and year-round &lt;a href=\"hiking%20trail\"&gt;hiking trail&lt;/a&gt;s. It is sometimes referred to as American Sumas to distinguish it from an &lt;a href=\"Sumas%20Mountain%20%28British%20Columbia%29\"&gt;identically named mountain&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border\"&gt;Canada\u2013United States border&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; just to the north, both of which are drained by &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; creeks of the &lt;a href=\"Sumas%20River\"&gt;Sumas River&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountain is largely owned by the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Washington Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, but some parcels are privately held. While the public land is open for recreation, it is managed primarily for timber harvest. &lt;a href=\"Clearcutting\"&gt;Clearcuts&lt;/a&gt; are present on many slopes and most all the remaining forest is in varying stages of recovery and regrowth.\n&lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Route%20547\"&gt;Washington State Route 547&lt;/a&gt;, which traverses a low pass on the mountain's northern flank, runs northwest from the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Route%20542\"&gt;Mount Baker Highway&lt;/a&gt;, (SR 542) in &lt;a href=\"Kendall%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Kendall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Route%209\"&gt;SR 9&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sumas%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Sumas&lt;/a&gt;, which is located on the Canada\u2013United States border and south of &lt;a href=\"Abbotsford%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Abbotsford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Milwaukee%2C%20St.%20Paul%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt; once traversed the same pass.\nThe controversial &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Creek%20Landslide\"&gt;Swift Creek Landslide&lt;/a&gt; is located on the mountain's western slope."
