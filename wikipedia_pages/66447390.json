    "text": "&lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s participation in the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; occurred automatically when the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"British%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany%20%281914%29\"&gt;declared war on Germany&lt;/a&gt; in August 1914. Due to her status as a &lt;a href=\"Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa, whilst having significant levels of self-autonomy, did not have the legal power to exercise an independent foreign policy and was tied to the British declaration.\nIn 1914, South Africa was far from being a united country with a singular national identity. Union had occurred only four years previously, and the peace after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; (1899-1902) had not yet healed the deep and traumatic ethnic divisions within the white population.\nThe declaration of the war was met with a wide variety of public opinions. Predominantly, English-speaking whites were by far the most supportive, strongly backing the mother country and volunteering in their tens of thousands. Some pro-republican &lt;a href=\"Afrikaners\"&gt;Afrikaners&lt;/a&gt;, outraged by British influence over South Africa, staged an &lt;a href=\"Maritz%20rebellion\"&gt;armed rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against the Government in 1914 in an attempt to re-establish independence. Black South Africans were largely apathetic to the declaration. Although barred by &lt;a href=\"Apartheid%20legislation\"&gt;racial legislation&lt;/a&gt; from being allowed to carry weapons, many still joined the National Labour Service with thousands being deployed to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as non-combatants. Whilst some saw it as a purely 'white man's war', others were convinced that loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crown\"&gt;British Crown&lt;/a&gt; would be rewarded and that their political situation would improve once the war was won. The &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;South African Native National Congress&lt;/a&gt;, the forerunner of the African National Congress, publicly announced the cessation of law action against the Government, pledging complete national support for the war effort.\nBetween 1914 and 1918, over 250,000 South Africans of all races, from a population of 6 million, volunteered to serve. Thousands more enlisted the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; directly, with over 3,000 joining the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt;. More than 146,000 Whites, 83,000 Blacks, and 2,500 Coloureds and Indians fought in either &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, or in Europe on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. Over 7,000 South Africans were killed, and nearly 12,000 were wounded during the course of the war. won the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; for gallantry, the Empire\u2019s highest and most prestigious military medal.\nOutbreak of war.\nFollowing the British &lt;a href=\"British%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany%20%281914%29\"&gt;declaration of war against Germany&lt;/a&gt; on 4 August 1914, South Africa was consequently part of the conflict due to her status as a &lt;a href=\"Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Although with significant levels of &lt;a href=\"Self-governance\"&gt;self-government&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa, along with &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; for example, were only semi-independent and could not exercise an autonomous &lt;a href=\"foreign%20policy\"&gt;foreign policy&lt;/a&gt; separate to &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20relations%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;that of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was seen by South African Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Botha\"&gt;Louis Botha&lt;/a&gt; that the war offered an opportunity for territorial expansion, and that South Africa could possibly incorporate the small neighbouring colonies of &lt;a href=\"Basutoland\"&gt;Basutoland (Lesotho)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bechuanaland%20Protectorate\"&gt;Bechuanaland (Botswana)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South-West Africa&lt;/a&gt; similarly proved a tempting aspiration. Defence Minister General &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Jan Smuts&lt;/a&gt; even mooted plans that should &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;German East Africa&lt;/a&gt; be occupied, the territory could be used in negotiations with the Portuguese in exchange for the southern half of &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;. Such an agreement would allow the industrial region of the &lt;a href=\"Transvaal%20%28province%29\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; to utilise the more immediate and adjacent ports of &lt;a href=\"Beira%2C%20Mozambique\"&gt;Beira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maputo\"&gt;Lourenco Marques (Maputo)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Britain refused to cede colonies to South Africa, and was equally reluctant to discuss any post-war territorial claims, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Botha\"&gt;Botha&lt;/a&gt; and General &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Smuts&lt;/a&gt; quickly became trusted and energetic members of the British &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20War%20Cabinet\"&gt;Imperial War Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. It was soon agreed that South Africa was able to adequately defend itself and that British garrison forces could be withdrawn to fight in Europe. Further discussions acknowledged that South Africa would be well placed to mount an invasion of &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South-West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, particularly to seize key naval installations and wireless communication centres.\nSouth African politics and African nationalism.\nAfter the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Union in 1910&lt;/a&gt;, the first South African government was formed by the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Party\"&gt;South African Party (SAP)&lt;/a&gt; which had &lt;a href=\"1910%20South%20African%20general%20election\"&gt;won 67 of the 121&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary seats available. Led by the former Boer veteran &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Botha\"&gt;Louis Botha&lt;/a&gt;, the SAP pursued a reconciliatory relationship with Britain, was favourable to South Africa being a self-governing &lt;a href=\"Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; within the Empire, and was generally supported by moderates of both races (Afrikaner and English speakers). In the immediate years before the First World War, South Africa routinely used force to suppress both black and white labour unrest, particularly in the economically important mining industry. As Minister of Mines, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Jan Smuts&lt;/a&gt; in July 1913 deployed troops to quell a strike of over 18,000 white workers. After requesting in Police, Mounted Riflemen, and even British garrison forces, the strike escalated into a wider industrial riot and then quasi-uprising against the Government. With increased violence and death being reported in &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, martial law was declared after public property was destroyed and troops responded with live fire. More than 20 people were killed and fears were so great that it was thought that Johannesburg and critical mine infrastructure would be completely destroyed. Botha and Smuts hurried from &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate with the strikers directly, and although Smuts despised the agreement that stated workers grievances would be investigated and those dismissed would be reinstated, he signed after being informed that government troops were beginning to lose control. Later in 1913, the South African Mounted Rifles were deployed to persuade &lt;a href=\"Mahatma%20Gandhi\"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; into calling off an Indian led strike in &lt;a href=\"Natal%20%28province%29\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt;. When another general strike occurred the following year in January 1914, Smuts, who was determined not to concede again, crushed the walkout with over 10,000 troops, machine guns and artillery.\nBy the end of 1914, disillusioned &lt;a href=\"Afrikaners\"&gt;Afrikaners&lt;/a&gt; increasingly resented the support that South Africa was giving the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; (which they despised) during the First World War, as well the perception that Afrikaner culture was being neglected and should be developed separately from English-speaking &lt;a href=\"white%20South%20Africans\"&gt;white South Africans&lt;/a&gt;. They were influenced by recent memories of the Second Boer War, in which the &lt;a href=\"Boer%20Republics\"&gt;Boer Republics&lt;/a&gt; fought against Britain. &lt;a href=\"J.%20B.%20M.%20Hertzog\"&gt;J.B.M. Hertzog&lt;/a&gt;, another Boer veteran and former Minister of Justice under Botha, formed the &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;National Party (NP)&lt;/a&gt; which gained 20 new seats in the &lt;a href=\"1915%20South%20African%20general%20election\"&gt;1915 October election&lt;/a&gt; - forcing the SAP to become a &lt;a href=\"minority%20government\"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the war with parliamentary support from the pro-British Natal based &lt;a href=\"Unionist%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1912, the South African Native National Congress - later renamed the &lt;a href=\"African%20National%20Congress\"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; - was founded in &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt; as an organisation that could defend and advance black rights and freedoms on a national scale. As the first western-styled African political organisation, the founding members, who themselves were members of the elite and saw themselves as gentlemen, almost exclusively undertook legal campaigns against racial discrimination. In August 1914, the SANNC temporarily suspended its campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Natives%20Land%20Act%2C%201913\"&gt;Natives Land Act&lt;/a&gt; (banning Africans from purchasing land outside the reserves) and declared nationwide support for the war effort.\nAn SANNC delegation that was already in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, as well as sympathetic newspapers, proposed that black Africans could volunteer to fight for South Africa in exchange for an improvement in civil rights. Denied permission to serve on the front lines, the SANNC supported the creation of the unarmed &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Native%20Labour%20Corps\"&gt;South African Native Labour Corps&lt;/a&gt; as a way to participate in the war and serve South Africa. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"African%20Political%20Organization\"&gt;African Political Organisation (APO)&lt;/a&gt;, which was also founded in 1912 to promote &lt;a href=\"Coloureds\"&gt;Coloured people&lt;/a&gt;, had organised over 10,000 potential volunteers as early as December 1914. In 1918 the SANNC sent a petition to King &lt;a href=\"George%20V\"&gt;George V&lt;/a&gt; highlighting black contributions to the war effort and requesting equality. Although the Coloured, &lt;a href=\"Indian%20South%20Africans\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bantu%20peoples%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; establishment had hoped that enthusiastic and genuine support for the war would be an opportunity to gain equal status, they were to be left bitterly disappointed as they went unrewarded and civil rights continued to be denied after the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnion Defence Force.\nAfter the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Union of South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, in 1910, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Jan Smuts&lt;/a&gt; placed a high priority on establishing a unified national military that would be responsible for national defence. The Defence Act (No. 13) of 1912 saw the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Defence%20Force%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Union Defence Force (UDF)&lt;/a&gt; which was made up of a Permanent Force of career soldiers, an Active Citizen Force of conscripts and volunteers, as well a Cadet force. It was not considered financially or practically realistic at this time for South Africa to undertake naval responsibility as well, and continued to rely on the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Although the UDF had been intended to blend British and Boer military traditions together, the reality saw the organisation draw heavily on British tradition and alienated Afrikaners by\u00a0favouring the &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to South Africa\u2019s attitudes towards &lt;a href=\"Apartheid\"&gt;racial segregation&lt;/a&gt;, at the time, only &lt;a href=\"White%20South%20Africans\"&gt;White South Africans&lt;/a&gt; were allowed to be armed and serve in combat due to fears that a multi-racial army would undermine racial separation in wider South African society. In peacetime all white males aged between 17 and 25 were eligible for compulsory military service, although only around half were chosen for duty by the use of a lottery system. Compulsory cadet training was organised for white males between the ages of 13 and 17, and a General Reserve of local rifle associations and former &lt;a href=\"Boer%20Commando\"&gt;Boer commandos&lt;/a&gt; was also developed.\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, the Union Defence Force of South Africa consisted of the small, but professional, Permanent Force of 2,500 South African Mounted Riflemen in five regiments with artillery sections, alongside an Active Citizen Force of nearly 23,000 conscripts and volunteers. Due to the political sensitivity within South Africa, enforced conscription could never be enacted.\nAs the war progressed and casualties mounted, in September 1915 the Government changed slightly from racial principals and decided to raise &lt;a href=\"Battalion\"&gt;infantry battalions&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Coloureds\"&gt;Cape Coloured&lt;/a&gt; men wishing to serve. Open from 25 October, the first recruitment station at City Hall in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; was so overwhelmed with applicants that it later required police assistance to control the crowd. Recruiting stations were later opened in &lt;a href=\"Stellenbosch\"&gt;Stellenbosch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Worcester%2C%20Western%20Cape\"&gt;Worcester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Port%20Elizabeth\"&gt;Port Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kimberley%2C%20Northern%20Cape\"&gt;Kimberley&lt;/a&gt; to name a few, all with similar levels of high interest by the Coloured population. The &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Corps\"&gt;Cape Corps&lt;/a&gt; was generally expected to undertake non-combatant roles such as transport, pioneers, and guard details.\nIn 1916, the Government responded to British requests for manual workers to help operate French infrastructure due to a severe labour shortage by establishing the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Native%20Labour%20Corps\"&gt;South African Native Labour Corps (SANLC)&lt;/a&gt;. Open to black South Africans, there was large scale opposition from many sections of South African society, including black opposition. Although paid around 10% more a month than average labourers, sections of the black population feared that the man's absence might make it easier for his family to be evicted at home. Meanwhile, white society feared the loss of cheap labour and the effect of exposure to Europe and European politics would have on the attitudes of the black population once they returned. Nevertheless, the SANLC went on to recruit 25,000 men, with 21,000 being transported to France.\nMaritz Rebellion.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;South African War&lt;/a&gt; had ended just twelve years previously, and with the memories of the horrific suffering experienced by some Afrikaners in &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;British concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; still fresh, there was a significant amount of opposition against the declaration of war in support of Britain. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Maritz%20rebellion\"&gt;Martiz Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, or the Boer Revolt, around 12,000 Afrikaners undertook an armed insurrection against the South African Government in October 1914 after refusing to invade &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South-West Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nNationalist republicans such as &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Frederick%20Beyers\"&gt;C.F. Beyers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christiaan%20de%20Wet\"&gt;Christiaan de Wet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Kemp%20%28general%29\"&gt;Jan Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Manie%20Maritz\"&gt;Manie Maritz&lt;/a&gt;, including many other senior military officers had resigned their commissions and gathered around the \u2018&lt;a href=\"Boers\"&gt;Boer&lt;/a&gt; prophet\u2019 &lt;a href=\"Siener%20van%20Rensburg\"&gt;Nicolaas van Rensburg&lt;/a&gt;. During an attempted &lt;a href=\"Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;military coup&lt;/a&gt; on 15 September 1914, &lt;a href=\"Koos%20de%20la%20Rey\"&gt;Koos de la Rey&lt;/a&gt;, a famous Boer military commander, was shot and killed after his car failed to stop at a police checkpoint. A further military coup took place a month later after a military force, led by Manie Maritz, refused to advance his column into German South-West Africa, leaving the second column dangerously exposed. After disarming loyalist soldiers, Maritz declared South Africa to be independent and contacted the Germans.\nBy late October, over nearly 12,000 armed Boer rebels had been recruited and had occupied local towns and launched uncoordinated attacks on trains. Rejecting outside British or Imperial assistance, Botha decided to confront the rebellion with his own force of 32,000 loyalists, mostly Afrikaners themselves. In the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Free%20State%20%28province%29\"&gt;Orange Free State&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Winburg\"&gt;Winburg&lt;/a&gt;, 5,000 rebels under de Wet were encircled and surrendered on 12 November. Shortly after, loyalist forces routed Beyers at &lt;a href=\"Bultfontein\"&gt;Bultfontein&lt;/a&gt; where he himself later drowned after trying to escape over the &lt;a href=\"Vaal%20River\"&gt;Vaal River&lt;/a&gt;. By December 1914, the rebellion had been effectively crushed within South Africa. Kemp and several hundred rebels had fled across the &lt;a href=\"Kalahari%20Desert\"&gt;Kalahari Desert&lt;/a&gt;, riding over 800 miles, into German territory where they were warmly welcomed and combined with Maritz.\nOver 1,000 people were killed or wounded during the rebellion, however, Prime Minister Botha encouraged national reconciliation and often showed mercy. Of the 239 rebels that faced trial, only around 50 remained in prison by the end of 1915. Van Rensburg received an 18-month sentence, Kemp served a year and nine months out of seven years, and de Wet served six months of his six-year sentence. Maritz had initially fled to &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; before returning to South Africa to serve three years. Only &lt;a href=\"Jopie%20Fourie\"&gt;Jopie Fourie&lt;/a&gt;, a rebel who had forgotten to resign his military commission, was executed for &lt;a href=\"treason\"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt;. English-speaking whites considered the sentences scandalous and far too lenient. Black leaders of emerging political organisations noticed the double standard in comparison to the harsh justice handed to the rebels of the &lt;a href=\"Bambatha%20Rebellion\"&gt;Zulu Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in 1906. Afrikaner nationalists continued to celebrate the rebels well into the 20th Century, and in August 1915 7,000 Afrikaner women marched in Pretoria to demand total amnesty.\nGerman South-West Africa Campaign (1914 - 1915).\nOn 7 August 1914, three days after the declaration of war, Britain requested that South African troops capture the three German wireless communication stations at &lt;a href=\"Windhoek\"&gt;Windhoek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swakopmund\"&gt;Swakopmund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCderitz%20Bay\"&gt;Luderitzbucht&lt;/a&gt; in German South-West Africa. With the &lt;a href=\"Namibia%E2%80%93South%20Africa%20border\"&gt;South African-German border&lt;/a&gt; being mostly open desert and absent of water, this difficult terrain allowed the German colonial forces, numbering around 3,000 regular &lt;a href=\"Schutztruppe\"&gt;Schutztruppe&lt;/a&gt; and 7,000 militia to deploy defensively along expected lines of attack. The first invasion attempt of the colony failed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sandfontein\"&gt;Battle of Sandfontein&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 1914. German troops inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing South Africans, however, allowed survivors to escape without harm.\nAs a consequence of the &lt;a href=\"Maritz%20rebellion\"&gt;Maritz Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; which caused a serious disruption within South Africa, German forces undertook a pre-emptive invasion alongside Boer rebels. In December 1914 a German offensive crossed the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20River\"&gt;Orange River&lt;/a&gt; and threatened the South African town of &lt;a href=\"Upington\"&gt;Upington&lt;/a&gt;. After numerous disagreements between German and Boer commanders, a badly coordinated attack at Upington in January 1915 was repulsed by South African forces under &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20van%20Deventer%20%28general%29\"&gt;Jacob van Deventer&lt;/a&gt;. A supporting German offensive was later halted and pushed back on 4 February 1915 at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kakamas\"&gt;Battle of Kakamas&lt;/a&gt;, a skirmish for control of two crossings over the Orange River.\nAs the home front became more secure, South African forces began to occupy German South-West Africa from March 1915. Prime Minister Botha personally took command of the northern invasion force that had landed at the coastal town of &lt;a href=\"Swakopmund\"&gt;Swakopmund&lt;/a&gt; on 11 February. Advancing along the &lt;a href=\"Swakopmund%E2%80%93Windhoek%20line\"&gt;Swakop valley railway line&lt;/a&gt;, the northern force captured &lt;a href=\"Otjimbingwe\"&gt;Otjimbinge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karibib\"&gt;Karibib&lt;/a&gt;, Friedrichsfelde, Wilhelmsthal and &lt;a href=\"Okahandja\"&gt;Okahandja&lt;/a&gt;. On 5 May 1915 Botha occupied the colonial capital of &lt;a href=\"Windhoek\"&gt;Windhoek&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite German Colonial Forces offering terms of surrender after Windhoek fell, Botha rejected these calls and continued the offensive after dividing his force into four sections under Brits, Lukin, Manie Botha, and Myburgh. Brits marched north to the &lt;a href=\"Etosha%20pan\"&gt;Etosha Pan&lt;/a&gt; which cut German interior forces from access to coastal regions, while the other three sections marched northeast roughly following the Swakopmund to &lt;a href=\"Tsumeb\"&gt;Tsumeb&lt;/a&gt; railway line. Led by former &lt;a href=\"Boer%20Commando\"&gt;Boer Commandos&lt;/a&gt;, the sections moved extremely swiftly despite the harsh landscape conditions. German forces had made a stand at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Otavi\"&gt;Battle of Otavi&lt;/a&gt; on 1 July, however, later surrendered at &lt;a href=\"Khorab%20Memorial\"&gt;Khorab&lt;/a&gt; on 9 July 1915.\nDuring these actions, General Smuts had landed with another South African force at the coastal town of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCderitz\"&gt;L\u00fcderitz&lt;/a&gt; and advanced inland. After capturing &lt;a href=\"Keetmanshoop\"&gt;Keetmanshoop&lt;/a&gt; on 20 May, Smuts was met by two other South African columns that had pushed up from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Nolloth\"&gt;Port Nolloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kimberley%2C%20Northern%20Cape\"&gt;Kimberley&lt;/a&gt;. After marching along the railway line towards &lt;a href=\"Berseba%2C%20Namibia\"&gt;Beseba&lt;/a&gt;, Smuts captured the village of &lt;a href=\"Gibeon%2C%20Namibia\"&gt;Gibeon&lt;/a&gt; on 26 May after two days fighting. German forces retreated north seeking support from their capital, however, were met by General Botha instead where they duly surrendered.\nSouth Africa committed 78,000 men troops to the South-West Africa campaign - 45,000 White, and 33,000 African, Coloured, and Indian unarmed volunteers that worked as general labour, drivers, and railway workers. Despite South African racial regulation, a Coloured armed scout detachment was formed by those familiar with the terrain. During the course of the campaign, South Africa lost 113 men with 263 wounded. Another 153 died of disease or accidents.\nGerman Colonial Forces, although believed by Botha to be much larger than officially claimed, had a mixture of 2 to 3,000 mounted European infantry, and a reserve of over 3,000 volunteers supported by &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Machine%20gun\"&gt;machine guns&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Military%20aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. Germany endured over 1,000 casualties, with 103 killed. Around 4,000 soldiers surrendered, along with 37 field and 22 machine guns.\u00a0\nAlthough South Africa had desired to incorporate the territory into the Union officially, in 1919 the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations\"&gt;League of Nations&lt;/a&gt; granted only a &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Nations%20mandate\"&gt;Class C mandate&lt;/a&gt; to administer the colony until ready for self-government. Despite this, South-West Africa became a de facto \u2018fifth province\u2019, as well as having representation in the South African Parliament, until &lt;a href=\"Namibian%20independence\"&gt;Namibian independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1990.\u00a0\nSouth African Overseas Expeditionary Force.\nOrganisation.\nThe South African Union Defence Act of 1914 forbade the deployment of South African troops outside of its national borders and immediate surrounding territories. For South Africa to support Britain and the Empire during the war, the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Overseas%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;South African Overseas Expeditionary Force (SAOEF)&lt;/a&gt; was created by Prime Minister Botha and Jan Smuts in July 1915. Formed with volunteers from the UDF, the SAOEF would have the status of Imperial troops under British command, rather than independent South African units. As there was no formal link between the UDF and the SOEF, (as well as fighting as regular \u2018British\u2019 units) South African forces were not entitled to retain regimental colours awarded to them after the battle.\nGerman East Africa Campaign (1916-1918).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;East African campaign (World War I)&lt;/a&gt;, there was strong South African participation and leadership. \"SA Field Artillery\", the \"1st\" and \"2nd SA Mounted Brigades\", the \"2nd\" and \"3rd SA Infantry Brigades\", and the \"Cape Corps\" fought in British operations against German forces in &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;German East Africa&lt;/a&gt; (now Tanzania) from January 1916 until the war in Africa ended on 25 November 1918. Two South African generals, Lt. Gen. &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Smuts\"&gt;Jan Smuts&lt;/a&gt; and Lt. Gen. Sir &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20van%20Deventer%20%28general%29\"&gt;Jacob van Deventer&lt;/a&gt;, commanded the operations. Their major battles were: Salaita Hill, Kilimanjaro, and Kondoa-Irangi in 1916; and Behobeho, Narungombe, and Nyangao in 1917. Captain &lt;a href=\"William%20Anderson%20Bloomfield\"&gt;William Anderson Bloomfield&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; for gallantry.\nEgypt Campaign (1916).\nThe \"1st SA Infantry Brigade\" was deployed in British operations against the Sanusi in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; from January to March 1916. It fought in the &lt;a href=\"action%20of%20Halazin\"&gt;action of Halazin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"action%20of%20Agagiya\"&gt;action of Agagiya&lt;/a&gt;.\nWestern Front Campaign (1916\u20131918).\nThe \"SA Heavy Artillery\" and the \"1st SA Infantry Brigade\" fought in the trenches of the Western Front against German forces in France and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, from May 1916 until the war in Europe ended on 11 November 1918. They fought in the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Somme&lt;/a&gt; in 1916; Arras, &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt;, and Menin in 1917; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Passchendaele\"&gt;Passchendaele&lt;/a&gt;, Messines, Mont Kemmel, and &lt;a href=\"Cambrai\"&gt;Cambrai&lt;/a&gt; in 1918.\nThe two events of the campaign that are still commemorated are the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Delville%20Wood\"&gt;Delville Wood&lt;/a&gt; (part of the Somme offensive), and the sinking of the troopship &lt;a href=\"SS%20Mendi\"&gt;SS \"Mendi\"&lt;/a&gt;, with the loss of more than 600 African members of the \"&lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Native%20Labour%20Corps\"&gt;South African Native Labour Corps&lt;/a&gt;\" (1917).\nTwo SAOEF members, Pte &lt;a href=\"William%20Frederick%20Faulds\"&gt;William Frederick Faulds&lt;/a&gt; and L Cpl &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Hewitt\"&gt;William Henry Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; for gallantry.\nPalestine Campaign (1918).\nThe \"SA Field Artillery\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Cape%20Corps\"&gt;Cape Corps&lt;/a&gt;\" fought in &lt;a href=\"Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20campaign\"&gt;British operations against Turkish forces in Palestine&lt;/a&gt; from August 1917 until the end of the war in November 1918. They fought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza\"&gt;battles of Gaza&lt;/a&gt;, El Mughar, and &lt;a href=\"Nebi%20Samwil\"&gt;Nebi Samwil&lt;/a&gt; in 1917; and Tel Asur, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29\"&gt;Battle of Megiddo&lt;/a&gt; 1918, Sharon, and Nablus in 1918.\nDisbandment.\nThe SAOEF units and formations were disbanded in 1919. As there were no formal links between SAOEF units and the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Defence%20Force%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Union Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt; units which had provided their initial manpower, the SAOEF's war record, including its many honours, was not perpetuated by the UDF (except for the \"Cape Corps\" battle honours, which were allowed to the \"&lt;a href=\"Cape%20Corps\"&gt;SA Cape Corps Service Battalion&lt;/a&gt;\" formed in 1973).\nA Demobilisation Board and over 50 \u2018Returned Soldiers Committees\u2019 were established to help reintegrate white servicemen back into civilian life. Many returned to jobs that had been reserved by their employers, whilst others joined the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Allied Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; in Russia that was fighting the &lt;a href=\"Bolsheviks\"&gt;Bolsheviks&lt;/a&gt;, and some became part of the radical mineworkers\u2019 movement that led the &lt;a href=\"Rand%20Rebellion\"&gt;Rand Rebellion in 1922.&lt;/a&gt; Due to South African racial policies, employment support and official gratitude was never given to the Coloured, Black and Indian racial groups that had served.\nSouth African Aviation Corps (SAAC).\nAs early as 1912, the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Defence%20Force%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Union Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; established a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20training\"&gt;flying school&lt;/a&gt; at Alexandersfontein, near Kimberley, to train pilots for the proposed South African Aviation Corps (SAAC). South Africa\u2019s first military pilot was &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20van%20der%20Spuy\"&gt;Kenneth van der Spuy&lt;/a&gt; who qualified on 2 June 1914, with four others following him days later.\nSoon after the outbreak of war, the need for airpower in Southern Africa became acute after German reconnaissance aircraft were routinely spotted, and advancing South African columns in German South-West Africa attacked by hostile aircraft. On 29 January 1915, the South African Aviation Corp at long last became operational and was initially equipped with twelve steel-framed French &lt;a href=\"Farman%20HF.20\"&gt;Henri Farman F-27&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. Issues over the use of wooden aircraft from Britain and the USA had dictated the need to buy French due to the concerns of wooden planes in the hot dry climate of Southern Africa.\nAirfield construction was soon undertaken at &lt;a href=\"Walvis%20Bay\"&gt;Walvis Bay&lt;/a&gt; (then a South African enclave in German South-West Africa), and recruitment expanded to 75 prospective pilots. By the end of June the SAAC possessed six Henri Farman's and two British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2\"&gt;B.E.2c\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; along with three extra &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; pilots. From their first operational airfield at &lt;a href=\"Karibib\"&gt;Karabib&lt;/a&gt; in South West Africa, the SAAC flew reconnaissance, leaflet dropping and improvised bombing missions against German forces.\nSoon after the South West African campaign had ended, an independent squadron of mixed British and South African pilots was stood up and deployed to support operations in East Africa. &lt;a href=\"No.%2026%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 26 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; (also known as \u2018The South African Squadron\"), had eight aircraft of an F-27 and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2\"&gt;B.E2c&lt;/a&gt; combination transported and later flown to a &lt;a href=\"forward%20airfield\"&gt;forward airfield&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;German East Africa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mbuyuni\"&gt;Mbuyuni&lt;/a&gt;. The independent squadron flew close reconnaissance and observer missions throughout the campaign until February 1918 when it was withdrawn to &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; and later disbanded on 8 July 1918.\nAlthough the SAAC and the No. 26 Squadron was engaged in &lt;a href=\"German%20South%20West%20Africa\"&gt;German South West Africa&lt;/a&gt; and East Africa, thousands of South Africans travelled to Britain and volunteered for service with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; directly. Over 3,000 men flew with the RFC in Europe, suffering 260 active-duty fatalities. Forty-six pilots became fighter aces, with &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Beauchamp-Proctor\"&gt;Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor&lt;/a&gt; being the British Empire\u2019s fourth most successful ace with 54 confirmed victories.\nBetween 1918 and 1920, South African pilots took part in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Europe. In June 1918 the &lt;a href=\"North%20Russia%20intervention\"&gt;North Russian Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;, which had a Royal Air Force detachment (previously the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service), disembarked at &lt;a href=\"Murmansk\"&gt;Murmansk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"No.%2047%20Squadron%20RAF\"&gt;No. 47 Squadron RAF&lt;/a&gt; was commanded by South African &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Kinkead\"&gt;Samuel Kinkead&lt;/a&gt;, and had a number of other South African pilots such as &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20van%20der%20Spuy\"&gt;Kenneth van der Spuy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20van%20Ryneveld\"&gt;Pierre van Ryneveld&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth African Navy.\nDuring the First World War, South Africa could offer a limited, but strategically important, naval contribution despite not operating any vessels of its own.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; jurisdiction, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Naval%20Reserve\"&gt;RNVR (SA)&lt;/a&gt; manned a small number of converted whalers and trawlers that patrolled the &lt;a href=\"Coastline%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South African coast&lt;/a&gt;: defending port approaches, deterring German surface raiders, and engaging in local mine clearance - particularly in response to the operations of the highly successful raider &lt;a href=\"SMS%20Wolf%20%281913%29\"&gt;SMS \"Wolf\"&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. The heaviest loss of life caused by Wolf was the sinking of the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mail%20steamer\"&gt;mail steamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"SS%20Carlos%20de%20Eizaguirre\"&gt;SS \"Carlos de Eizaguirre\"&lt;/a&gt; which struck a mine off &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; on 26 May 1917, with 134 passengers and crew killed and 25 survivors.\nA total of 412 South Africans served in the RNVR (SA) during the war, with 164 members volunteering for the Royal Navy directly. Many would see service in British and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; waters, whilst others participated in the support of the land campaigns of South West Africa and East Africa against German forces.\nIn conjunction with limited manpower contributions, South Africa offered to the Allies the crucial strategic position of controlling the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Route\"&gt;Cape Sea Route&lt;/a&gt; - a key &lt;a href=\"Choke%20point\"&gt;chokepoint&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20transport\"&gt;maritime trade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Command%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;sea control&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Naval%20Base%20Simon%27s%20Town\"&gt;Simon\u2019s Town Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; in the Cape was the principal operating base for the \"&lt;a href=\"Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Africa%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Cape of Good Hope Station and West Africa Station&lt;/a&gt;\" from where German trade could be intercepted and commerce raiders attacked. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt; were equally important to the war effort. As rest stops, refuelling stations, and offering repair facilities, the Imperial sea lanes to the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Australasia\"&gt;Australasia&lt;/a&gt; were kept open.\nWith the conclusion of hostilities in 1918, members of the RNVR(SA) were demobilised and all &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; requisitioned South African ships were promptly returned to their civilian owners.\nSouth African contributions and casualties.\nWith a population of roughly 6 million, between 1914-1918 over 250,000 South Africans of all races voluntarily served their country. Thousands more served in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; directly, with over 3,000 joining the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Flying%20Corps\"&gt;Royal Flying Corps&lt;/a&gt; and over 100 volunteering for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. It is probable that near 50% of &lt;a href=\"White%20South%20Africans\"&gt;white men&lt;/a&gt; of military age served during the war. More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 black Africans and 2,500 Coloureds and Asians served in either German South-West Africa, East Africa, the Middle East, or on the Western Front in Europe. Suffering roughly 19,000 casualties, over 7,000 South Africans were killed and nearly 12,000 were wounded during the course of the war. won the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; for gallantry, the Empire\u2019s highest and most prestigious military medal. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Delville%20Wood\"&gt;Battle of Delville Wood&lt;/a&gt; and the sinking of the &lt;a href=\"SS%20Mendi\"&gt;SS \"Mendi\"&lt;/a&gt; being the greatest single incidents of loss of life.\nThe assistance that South Africa gave the British Empire was significant. Two German African colonies were occupied, either by South Africa alone or with significant South African assistance. Manpower, from all races, helped Allied operations not just on the Western Front and Africa, but also in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. South Africa\u2019s ports and infrastructure on the Home Front were a crucial strategic asset for war on a global scale. Providing important rest and refuelling stations, the Royal Navy could ensure vital sea lane connections to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; and the Empire in the Far East stayed open.\nEconomically, South Africa supplied two-thirds of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mining\"&gt;gold production&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, with most of the remainder coming from Australia. At the start of the war, &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20England\"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; officials in London worked with South Africa to block gold shipments to &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and force mine owners to sell only to the &lt;a href=\"HM%20Treasury\"&gt;British Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, at prices set by the Treasury. This facilitated purchases of munitions and food from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20in%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and other neutral countries."
