In 1981 he was a founding member of &lt;a href=\"Anson%20Funderburgh\"&gt;Anson Funderburgh&lt;/a&gt;'s Rockets and sang with them until 1985. He was then part of &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morgan%20%28blues%20musician%29\"&gt;Mike Morgan's Crawl&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and joining up with &lt;a href=\"Ronnie%20Earl\"&gt;Ronnie Earl&lt;/a&gt;'s Broadcasters in 1988.\nHe began his solo career late in 1990, relocating to &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"James%20Cotton\"&gt;James Cotton&lt;/a&gt; then asked him to sing with Cotton's band on tour, after Cotton had lost his own &lt;a href=\"human%20voice\"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt;.
