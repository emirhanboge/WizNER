    "text": " (7 October 1920 \u2013 7 August 1944), was a Belgian &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;resistance fighter&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nFernande Volral was born in &lt;a href=\"Champigneulles\"&gt;Champigneulles&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Nancy%2C%20France\"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;, in October 1920. During the 1930s, her family moved to &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;, in Belgium. When she became an adult, she moved to &lt;a href=\"Jette\"&gt;Jette&lt;/a&gt;, launching a career in fashion.\nIn 1941, she met Raoul Baligand, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Partisans%20Arm%C3%A9s\"&gt;Partisans Arm\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the Belgian underground resistance. She originally served as a liaison agent, before joining the \"10 de la rue de la perle\" de &lt;a href=\"Molenbeek-Saint-Jean\"&gt;Molenbeek-Saint-Jean&lt;/a&gt; group. The group was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Front%20de%20l%27Ind%C3%A9pendance\"&gt;Front de l'Ind\u00e9pendance&lt;/a&gt;, which mainly consisted of Italian anti-fascists who had fought in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War.\nIn late-1942, she led a number of successful sabotage missions with the group.\nOn 23 February 1943, she was betrayed to the fascist authorities. When German police came to arrest her at her home, she fought back, wounding one before being subdued.\nShe was imprisoned in Saint-Gilles Prison until being deported to Germany to be held in a prison in &lt;a href=\"Leer\"&gt;Leer&lt;/a&gt; and to be tried by the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Court%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;People's Court&lt;/a&gt;. Her trial was held on the same day as that of &lt;a href=\"Marguerite%20Bervoets\"&gt;Marguerite Bervoets&lt;/a&gt;, and both women were issued with the same sentence: death. She was the transferred to &lt;a href=\"Wolfenb%C3%BCttel\"&gt;Wolfenb\u00fcttel&lt;/a&gt;, where she was executed by beheading in early August 1944."
