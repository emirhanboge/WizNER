The dam was originally installed to help provide &lt;a href=\"hydropower\"&gt;hydropower&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Sawmill%20River\"&gt;Sawmill River&lt;/a&gt;, then the site of numerous &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;mills&lt;/a&gt;. Lake Wyola Dam is of earthen construction. The dam is a , masonry &lt;a href=\"embankment%20dam\"&gt;embankment dam&lt;/a&gt; with a concrete &lt;a href=\"spillway\"&gt;spillway&lt;/a&gt;. Its capacity is . Normal storage is . It drains an area of .\nIn 1998 the dam was classified as a high-hazard dam by state officials. They said that there was a potential for a large loss of property and life downstream, in the towns of &lt;a href=\"Leverett%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Leverett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montague%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt;, if the dam should fail. In 2005 during heavy storms, there was great concern for its stability as the area directly below the dam flooded severely.\nIn July 2008, despite the evident and urgent need for repair or replacement the Massachusetts governor denied funding for the dam's repair. Many local residents, particularly in Leverett and Montague, were frustrated with the governor's decision. However, with so many dams in Massachusetts in need of repair, others question if the state should be spending millions to rehabilitate old dams.\nDespite the gubernatorial veto, funding was eventually obtained and construction began at the dam in the fall of 2008. The repairs were completed in May 2009."
