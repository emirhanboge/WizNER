    "text": "Hugh Edward Holdcroft (c. 1882 \u2013 4 February 1952) was an &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Burslem Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1900s.\nPlaying career.\nHoldcroft joined &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Burslem Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in October 1901. His debut came at centre-half in a goalless draw with &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Ground%20%28Cobridge%29\"&gt;Athletic Ground&lt;/a&gt; on 8 September 1902. He scored his first goal in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; on 25 October, converting a penalty in a 3\u20133 draw with &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turf%20Moor\"&gt;Turf Moor&lt;/a&gt;. He became a first team regular for the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; side from the next month until he suffered a &lt;a href=\"toe\"&gt;toe&lt;/a&gt; injury in February 1903 and transferred to &lt;a href=\"Potteries%20derby\"&gt;local rivals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke&lt;/a&gt; in March 1903. At \u00a3500 this was a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics\"&gt;club record&lt;/a&gt; for Stoke.\nHoldcroft was converted into a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;centre forward&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt; with mixed success. He hit two goals in a 5\u20132 win over &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; on 17 October 1903, and opened the &lt;a href=\"1905%E2%80%9306%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1905\u201306&lt;/a&gt; season with a goal in each of the first three &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; games, but other than these highlights he proved to be far from a natural goalscorer and in three seasons he scored 11 goals in 44 appearances. After retiring due to an ankle injury and later suffering a serious illness that prevented him finding a job, Vale and Stoke held a benefit match on his behalf on 29 April 1907; the game finished 1\u20131. This would prove to be Burslem Port Vale's final ever match, as the club were dissolved, only to re-emerge later in the year when Cobridge Church renamed themselves Port Vale F.C.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:"
