    "text": "The 2009\u201310 South West Peninsula League season was the third in the history of the &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Peninsula%20League\"&gt;South West Peninsula League&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in England, that feeds the Premier Division of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Football%20League\"&gt;Western Football League&lt;/a&gt;. The league had been formed in 2007 from the merger of the &lt;a href=\"Devon%20County%20Football%20League\"&gt;Devon County League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Western%20Football%20League\"&gt;South Western League&lt;/a&gt;, and is restricted to clubs based in Cornwall and Devon. The Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League is on the same level of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20System\"&gt;National League System&lt;/a&gt; as the Western League Division One.\nThe champions for the first time in their history were &lt;a href=\"Buckland%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Buckland Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nPremier Division.\nThe Premier Division featured 20 teams, the same as the previous season. Two new clubs joined the league after &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Abbot%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newton Abbot&lt;/a&gt; were expelled and &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Abbot%20Spurs%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newton Abbot Spurs&lt;/a&gt; were relegated to Division One East:"
