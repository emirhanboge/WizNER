    "text": "Prosopis alba is a &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;n tree species that grows in central &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gran%20Chaco\"&gt;Gran Chaco&lt;/a&gt; ecoregion, and part of the &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Argentine Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. It is known as \"algarrobo blanco\" ('white carob tree') in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. Spanish settlers gave it that name because of its similarity to the European &lt;a href=\"Ceratonia%20siliqua\"&gt;carob tree&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ceratonia siliqua\"). Other common names come from &lt;a href=\"Guarani%20language\"&gt;Guaran\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;, including ibop\u00e9 and igop\u00e9.\n\"Prosopis alba\" is a medium-sized tree, measuring between , in height and in diameter, though such tall specimens occur very rarely at present. The trunk is short and the treetop is globular, sometimes reaching in diameter. The &lt;a href=\"Bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt; is thin, brown-grayish in colour, with streaks, and it has &lt;a href=\"Tanning%20%28leather%29\"&gt;tanning&lt;/a&gt; properties.\nThe tree is employed for ornamental and utilitary roadside planting and &lt;a href=\"windbreak\"&gt;windbreak&lt;/a&gt;s. Its &lt;a href=\"timber\"&gt;timber&lt;/a&gt;, which is rather dense (&lt;a href=\"relative%20density\"&gt;relative density&lt;/a&gt; = 0.76) and difficult to work, is used for doors and floors, for furniture, for paving blocks, shoe lasts and &lt;a href=\"Oak%20%28wine%29\"&gt;wine casks&lt;/a&gt; (where it replaces the European &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;). The wood responds well to drying and is therefore valuable for work that requires stable dimensions regardless of humidity. It is also durable for outdoor use.\nThe &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are small, greenish-white or yellowish, and &lt;a href=\"Plant%20sexuality\"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pollination\"&gt;Pollination&lt;/a&gt;, mediated by &lt;a href=\"Anemophily\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt; and insects, is &lt;a href=\"Allogamy\"&gt;allogamous&lt;/a&gt; (crossed), since the female reproductive organs are turned active before the male ones.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;s are modified &lt;a href=\"Legume\"&gt;seedpods&lt;/a&gt;, long, with brown &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s about long. They contain a sweet &lt;a href=\"flour\"&gt;flour&lt;/a&gt;y paste (\"patay\"), very high in energy, that can be used for &lt;a href=\"fodder\"&gt;fodder&lt;/a&gt; or turned into &lt;a href=\"flour\"&gt;flour&lt;/a&gt; for human consumption. In the 1940s a mildly intoxicating beverage called \"aloja\" was made from it through &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20%28food%29\"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt;; in turn it was sometimes &lt;a href=\"distillation\"&gt;distilled&lt;/a&gt; to produce &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt;. Between half and three quarters of the fruit's weight is &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tree can reportedly tolerate &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;, salt and sand; in fact, it is extremely efficient with regard to water consumption, it produces the most fruits in years of drought and has been successfully introduced in arid terrains. However, it cannot stand even mild frost.\n\"Prosopis alba\" and other \"algarrobo\" species in genus \"&lt;a href=\"Prosopis\"&gt;Prosopis&lt;/a&gt;\", such as \"algarrobo negro\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Prosopis%20nigra\"&gt;P. nigra&lt;/a&gt;\"), are often confused or not correctly distinguished in botanical literature; in part this is due to the ease of &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybridization&lt;/a&gt; of the genus."
