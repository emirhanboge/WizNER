    "text": "The Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team is the &lt;a href=\"college%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;college ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team that represents &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; (MSU). The team plays at the &lt;a href=\"Munn%20Ice%20Arena\"&gt;Munn Ice Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;East Lansing, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, on the MSU campus. The current head &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Danton%20Cole\"&gt;Danton Cole&lt;/a&gt;, who took over coaching duties on April 11, 2017, after &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Anastos\"&gt;Tom Anastos&lt;/a&gt; resigned. Michigan State currently competes in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe MSU ice hockey program has seven &lt;a href=\"Central%20Collegiate%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;CCHA&lt;/a&gt; regular season championships and 11 &lt;a href=\"CCHA%20Tournament\"&gt;CCHA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; titles. MSU has also won 12 &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Invitational\"&gt;Great Lakes Invitational&lt;/a&gt; titles. The Spartans have been in the NCAA tournament 23 times, with nine &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Four\"&gt;Frozen Four&lt;/a&gt; appearances and three national titles (&lt;a href=\"1966%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1986%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2007%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). On April 7, 2007, the Michigan State Spartans won their third National Championship by beating &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131. &lt;a href=\"Michigan%E2%80%93Michigan%20State%20ice%20hockey%20rivalry\"&gt;Their traditional rival&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and the teams have played an annual game in Detroit since 1990. Starting at the &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Louis%20Arena\"&gt;Joe Louis Arena&lt;/a&gt;, the game has since moved to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Caesars%20Arena\"&gt;Little Caesars Arena&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Spartan Ice Hockey program traces its roots back to the first informal varsity team that began in 1922 playing an independent NCAA Division I schedule. On January 11, 1922, Michigan State played its first intercollegiate hockey game, a 1\u20135 loss to &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Home games during the first season were played on the frozen &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cedar%20River%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Red Cedar River&lt;/a&gt; on MSU's campus.\nMichigan State finished 0\u20133 in the 1922 season and picked up its first win during the second season on February 11, 1923, 6\u20131 over the Lansing Independents. The team did not play the 1923\u201324 season but returned for the 1924\u201325 season. The 1924\u201325 season marked the first time the program had a head coach, &lt;a href=\"John%20Kobs\"&gt;John Kobs&lt;/a&gt;, who also coached the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20Spartans%23Other%20sports\"&gt;Michigan State Spartans baseball team&lt;/a&gt;. Kobs' tenure at Michigan State lasted six season before the team was suspended for 19 seasons. During which time the team compiled a record of 8-18-1.\n&lt;a href=\"Harold%20Paulsen\"&gt;Harold Paulsen&lt;/a&gt; was hired as the varsity ice hockey coach at Michigan State on August 1, 1948 following the suspension of the hockey programs during the years of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Before recruiting or coaching, Paulsen oversaw the renovation of &lt;a href=\"Demonstration%20Hall\"&gt;Demonstration Hall&lt;/a&gt; into an indoor rink with artificial ice-making capabilities. On January 12, 1950, MSU played its first game since 1930, losing to &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Tech%20Huskies%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Michigan Tech&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20132. Paulsen struggled through his first two years at Michigan State with a 6\u201325 record. MSU athletic director Ralph Young felt the hockey program's progress was inadequate and Paulsen resigned. Following the 1951 season, &lt;a href=\"Amo%20Bessone\"&gt;Amo Bessone&lt;/a&gt; accepted the head coaching position at Michigan State University. Bessone would remain at MSU for the next 28 years.\nAmo Bessone era.\nWhen Bessone arrived at Michigan State, the ice hockey program was beginning its third full season after being reinstated. That same season, in 1951\u201352, the Spartans joined &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20College%20Tigers%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Colorado College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Pioneers%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, Michigan, Michigan Tech, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"North%20Dakota%20Fighting%20Sioux%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; as founding members of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Collegiate%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;Midwest Collegiate Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (MCHL).\nAmo Bessone won his first collegiate hockey game as head coach on November 29, 1951, when the Spartans defeated &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Agricultural%20College\"&gt;Ontario Agricultural College&lt;/a&gt; 8\u20132. The Spartans struggled with six losing seasons before Bessone turned things around in his seventh season as coach. In 1957\u201358, Michigan State enjoyed its first winning season. The following season, Bessone guided MSU to a Big Ten championship and a berth in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;NCAA tournament&lt;/a&gt;. The tournament was MSU's first &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Four\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; tournament appearance. The Spartans defeated &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Eagles%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20133 in the semifinals and advanced to the schools's first championship appearance. The Spartans lost the 1959 national championship game in overtime 3\u20134 to North Dakota. MSU finishes the season 17-6-1. Michigan State became a charter member of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Collegiate%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;Western Collegiate Hockey Association&lt;/a&gt; (WCHA) in 1959. The WCHA was a reincarnation of the loosely affiliated Midwest Collegiate Hockey League and Western Intercollegiate Hockey League that disbanded following the 1957\u201358 season. Bessone and MSU struggled during the first five seasons of the WCHA. Again, Bessone turned things around with a winning season in 1964\u201365. The following season, Bessone coached Michigan State to an improbable NCAA National Championship.\nMSU began the 1965\u201366 season 4-10, but rebounded winning 12 of their last 15 games including defeating the defending national champion, Michigan Tech, to win the WCHA playoffs after finishing sixth in the regular season. The win earned MSU a spot in the &lt;a href=\"1966%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1966 NCAA tournament&lt;/a&gt;. In the national semifinals, Bessone upset highly favored &lt;a href=\"Boston%20University%20Terriers%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 with a goal by Spartan forward, &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Volmar\"&gt;Doug Volmar&lt;/a&gt;. In the national championship game, Bessone and the Spartans faced &lt;a href=\"Len%20Ceglarski\"&gt;Len Ceglarski&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Clarkson%20Golden%20Knights%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; team that owned the national-best record of 24\u20132. On March 19, 1966, Michigan State beat top-ranked Clarkson 6\u20131 victory to give Michigan State is first national championship. Len Ceglarski and Amo Bessone shared the &lt;a href=\"Spencer%20Penrose%20Award\"&gt;Spencer Penrose Award&lt;/a&gt; as the national coach of the year in 1966. The national title and coaching award cemented Bessone's legacy as a coach. To this day, Bessone's 1966 Michigan State team remains one of the biggest underdog stories in NCAA ice hockey history. The total number of team victories (16) and team winning percentage (.551) is the lowest of any NCAA ice hockey champion. MSU made the NCAA tournament again with a strong WCHA playoff finish in 1967, but lost 2\u20134 in the national semifinals, a rematch of the 1966 NCAA Tournament against Boston University.\nBessone began the 1970s with six straight winning seasons. During Bessone's time coaching the Spartans the team won MSU won its first &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Invitational\"&gt;Great Lakes Invitational&lt;/a&gt; by defeating Michigan Tech 5\u20134 on December 28, 1973.\nAs MSU hockey was building momentum, &lt;a href=\"Munn%20Ice%20Arena\"&gt;Munn Ice Arena&lt;/a&gt; opened October 25, 1974, when Michigan State hosted &lt;a href=\"Laurentian%20University\"&gt;Laurentian&lt;/a&gt;. That same season saw the first sellout crowd in Munn's history when the Spartans defeated North Dakota 6\u20132. A season later, in 1975\u201376, Bessone guided MSU to its best WCHA conference record of 20-12-0 before Minnesota knocked MSU out of the WCHA playoffs in 6-7 triple overtime loss. Minnesota, who had finished below Michigan State in the conference, received an NCAA tournament bid instead. Bessone announced his retirement effective at the end of the 1978\u201379 season after three straight losing seasons. Bessone coached his final game as head coach on March 3, 1979, when the Spartans defeated rival Michigan 5\u20133.\nRon Mason era.\nAfter Amo Bessone retired from Michigan State University, the MSU Athletic Director, Joseph Kearney, hired &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Mason\"&gt;Ron Mason&lt;/a&gt; as the Spartans new head coach. Mason was named Spartan head coach on April 1, 1979, and spend the next 23 seasons at Michigan State. It was a rough start in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association for Mason as he compiled a record of 26-46-2 over two seasons. Michigan State joined the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Collegiate%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;Central Collegiate Hockey Association&lt;/a&gt; (CCHA) in 1981 and over the next few seasons Mason turned the hockey program around. The Spartans won CCHA playoff championships the first four straight seasons of the conference in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985. MSU would win a second national title in &lt;a href=\"1986%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; when the Spartans defeated &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20135.\nIn 2000 CCHA coaches and athletic directors unanimous voted to renamed the CCHA championship trophy to the &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Cup\"&gt;Mason Cup&lt;/a&gt; in honor of Ron Mason, who was a key figure in establishing the conference in the early 1970s prior to his tenure at Michigan State. During the 2000\u201301 season Michigan State finished first in the regular season and advanced through the CCHA Tournament winning the first ever Mason Cup. That same season the Spartans made a Frozen Four appearance by beating &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; 5-1 before losing to North Dakota in the Semifinal game. On October 6, 2001, the Spartans hosted an outdoor game at &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20Stadium%20%28East%20Lansing%29\"&gt;Spartan Stadium&lt;/a&gt; against rival Michigan known as &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;The Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. The school would set an attendance record for an outdoor hockey game as 74,554 fans attended. The game ended in a 3\u20133 tie.\nMason led Michigan State to seven CCHA regular season titles and a conference-record 10 CCHA tournament titles. In addition, MSU under Mason made 19 NCAA tournament appearances during his 23 seasons with the Spartans. He coached MSU to five NCAA Frozen Fours, two National Championship appearances, and one National Championship. Mason coached two &lt;a href=\"Hobey%20Baker%20Memorial%20Award\"&gt;Hobey Baker Memorial Award&lt;/a&gt; winners, &lt;a href=\"Kip%20Miller\"&gt;Kip Miller&lt;/a&gt; in 1990 and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Miller\"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; in 2001.\nRick Comley era.\nRick Comley was announced as Ron Mason's successor as head ice hockey coach at Michigan State University in March 2002. Comley led the Spartans to a tournament appearance in 2004, his second season as MSU's head coach. After losing to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Michigan%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Northern Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20CCHA%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2004 CCHA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; the Spartans received an at-large bid to the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2004 NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Third ranked MSU fell to second seed &lt;a href=\"Minnesota-Duluth%20Bulldogs%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Minnesota-Duluth&lt;/a&gt; in the opening round 0\u20135.\nComley's Spartans returned to the NCAA Tournament in &lt;a href=\"2006%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; after missing the NCAA Tournament in 2005. Comley guided MSU to a second-place CCHA finish in the regular season and a &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Cup\"&gt;CCHA Mason Cup Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20CCHA%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. Michigan State advanced into the 2006 Tournament with an automatic bid. The Spartans defeated &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 before losing to &lt;a href=\"Maine%20Black%20Bears%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20135 in the East Regional Final.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Michigan State was preseason ranked No. 5, which was MSU's highest preseason ranking since October 2001. The team earned an &lt;a href=\"2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; bid after finishing the regular season with a conference record of 15-10-3. Comley led MSU to defeat three higher-ranked teams en route to the national championship including No. 1-ranked &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; in the Midwest Regional final. In the Frozen Four the team defeated No. 4-ranked Boston College in the National Championship game on April 7, 2007, by a score of 3\u20131 in a game that saw Michigan State score three unanswered goals in the third period.\nIn December 2010 the Michigan State Spartans and Michigan Wolverines played a second outdoor game at &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Stadium\"&gt;Michigan Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The game, known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Chill%20at%20the%20Big%20House\"&gt;The Big Chill at the Big House&lt;/a&gt;, took place on December 11, 2010. 104,173 fans filled Michigan Stadium and watched as Michigan beat Michigan State 5\u20130. The attendance broke the 75,000 of the Cold War and 78,000 of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20IIHF%20World%20Championship\"&gt;2010 IIHF World Championship&lt;/a&gt; and set a new attendance record for a hockey game. Later that same season on January 25, 2011, Rick Comley announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2010\u201311 season.\nTom Anastos and Big Ten Conference era.\nIn September 2010 &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20University\"&gt;Penn State University&lt;/a&gt; announced that the university was elevating its men's and women's &lt;a href=\"American%20Collegiate%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;American Collegiate Hockey Association&lt;/a&gt; club programs to varsity status. Then-CCHA commissioner &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Anastos\"&gt;Tom Anastos&lt;/a&gt; publicly stated that the CCHA would strongly consider adding &lt;a href=\"Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; as the conference's 12th member. On March 21, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced plans to sponsor men's ice hockey starting in 2013\u201314 season. Michigan State along with CCHA rivals, University of Michigan and Ohio State University will leave the CCHA to join University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin from the WCHA and Penn State to form a six-team Big Ten Hockey Conference. Less than a week after the Big Ten's announcement Michigan State announced that former CCHA Commissioner, Tom Anastos would become the 6th head coach in the history of the program. Anastos is a former Spartan hockey player who played for MSU from 1981 to 1985. He is also the former coach at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan%E2%80%93Dearborn%23Athletics\"&gt;Michigan-Dearborn&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics\"&gt;NAIA&lt;/a&gt;) from 1987 to 1990, and compiled a 68-37-7 record. He later served as an assistant coach under Ron Mason from 1990 to 1992.\nAnastos picked up his first NCAA DI coaching victory with Michigan State in the second game of the 2012 Icebreaker tournament with a 3\u20132 overtime win over &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20Falcons%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The Spartans finished the 2011\u201312 season ranked 5th in the CCHA standings and received a first round bye in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20CCHA%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;CCHA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. The Spartans faced fourth-seeded &lt;a href=\"Miami%20RedHawks%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;Miami (OH)&lt;/a&gt; in the second round, in the best-of-three series Michigan State was swept 0-6 and 1\u20134 in two games. Despite being swept by Miami, the Spartans finished 15th in the Pairwise rankings and became the final at-large bid selected for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2012 NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. The bid marked the team's first appearance in the NCAA post-season since 2008, the team was placed in the East Region held at &lt;a href=\"Webster%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Webster Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Bridgeport, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. In the game, Union College took an early lead and held the Spartans to a single goal in a 3\u20131 win over Michigan State in the East Regional semifinal. The game was the first meeting between the two programs and also the first win in the NCAA Division I national tournament for the Dutchmen.\nAt the end of the 2016\u201317 season, it was announced that Tom Anastos would step down as head coach of the Spartans. MSU then announced that they had hired Danton Cole as the program's 7th head coach.\nDanton Cole era.\nOn April 11, 2017, &lt;a href=\"Danton%20Cole\"&gt;Danton Cole&lt;/a&gt; was announced as the new head coach at Michigan State University. In Cole first season, 2017\u201318, the Spartans finished last in the Big Ten and were swept in a three-game series in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Big%20Ten%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;conference tournament&lt;/a&gt; by Ohio State.
