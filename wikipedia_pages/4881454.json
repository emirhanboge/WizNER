    "text": "Mean 18 is a &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; video game designed by Rex Bradford with graphics by George Karalias, both of Microsmiths, and released by &lt;a href=\"Accolade%20%28company%29\"&gt;Accolade&lt;/a&gt; for MS-DOS in 1986. It was ported to the &lt;a href=\"Commodore%2064\"&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amiga\"&gt;Amiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20IIgs\"&gt;Apple IIgs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atari%207800\"&gt;Atari 7800&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atari%20ST\"&gt;Atari ST&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Macintosh\"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;. It includes an editor allowing players to create their own courses.\nGameplay.\n\"Mean 18\" includes the Augusta National and &lt;a href=\"Pebble%20Beach%20Golf%20Links\"&gt;Pebble Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20and%20Ancient%20Golf%20Club%20of%20St%20Andrews\"&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; courses. It uses a 3-click control system, where the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.\nThere are Beginner and Expert difficulty options. The Expert mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click more crucial. The player can also choose between regular and professional tees. For the regular mode, the tees are shorter and the computer automatically recommends the best club. Using the professional tees, the computer still recommends clubs, but not necessarily the best ones for the shot.\nReception.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Computer%20Gaming%20World\"&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/a&gt;\" cited the practice green, the computer caddy, and course editor as reasons for preferring the Amiga version of \"Mean 18\" to the also-\"outstanding\" \"&lt;a href=\"Leader%20Board\"&gt;Leader Board&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Info%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Info&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the Amiga version four stars out of five, stating \"If you're a golfer, you'll like Mean 18\" but criticizing the \"blocky IBM-style graphics. Complete &lt;a href=\"video%20game%20porting\"&gt;Amigatization&lt;/a&gt; would solve a lot of the problems\". \"&lt;a href=\"Compute%21\"&gt;Compute!&lt;/a&gt;\" listed it in May 1988 as one of \"Our Favorite Games\", praising the graphics, sound, realism, and course editor.\nDavid M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for \"&lt;a href=\"Computer%20Gaming%20World\"&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/a&gt;\", and stated that \"This may be the ultimate professional golf simulation. Outstanding graphics and sound are its hallmarks.\"\nThe game sold more than 200,000 copies."
