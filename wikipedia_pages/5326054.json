    "text": "HMS \"Northumberland\" was the last of the three &lt;a href=\"armoured%20frigate\"&gt;armoured frigate&lt;/a&gt;s built for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; during the 1860s. She had a different armour scheme and heavier armament than her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s, and was generally regarded as a half-sister to the other ships of the class. The ship spent her career with the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Squadron\"&gt;Channel Squadron&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally served as a &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;. \"Northumberland\" was placed in &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20fleet\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; in 1890 and became a &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; in 1898. She was converted into a coal &lt;a href=\"hulk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hulk&lt;/a&gt; in 1909 and sold in 1927, although the ship was not &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;scrapped&lt;/a&gt; until 1935.\nDesign and description.\nThe \"Minotaur\"-class armoured frigates were essentially enlarged versions of the ironclad with heavier armament, armour, and more powerful engines. They retained the &lt;a href=\"broadside%20ironclad\"&gt;broadside ironclad&lt;/a&gt; layout of their predecessor, but their sides were fully armoured to protect the 50 guns they were designed to carry. Their plough-shaped &lt;a href=\"Naval%20ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; was also more prominent than that of \"Achilles\".\n\"Northumberland\" was &lt;a href=\"Length%20between%20perpendiculars\"&gt;long between perpendiculars&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The ship displaced and had a &lt;a href=\"tonnage\"&gt;tonnage&lt;/a&gt; of 6,621 &lt;a href=\"Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement\"&gt;tons burthen&lt;/a&gt;. Her hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse &lt;a href=\"Bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt;s and had a &lt;a href=\"double%20bottom\"&gt;double bottom&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"engine%20room\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"boiler%20room%20%28ship%29\"&gt;boiler room&lt;/a&gt;s. The ship was considered \"a steady gun platform, able to maintain her speed in a seaway and satisfactory in manoeuvre\". She was authorized a crew of 705 officers and ratings, but actually carried 800 men.\nPropulsion.\n\"Northumberland\" had a two-cylinder &lt;a href=\"Trunk%20engine\"&gt;trunk steam engine&lt;/a&gt;, made by &lt;a href=\"John%20Penn%20%28engineer%29\"&gt;John Penn and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular &lt;a href=\"fire-tube%20boiler\"&gt;fire-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. It produced a total of during the ship's &lt;a href=\"sea%20trial\"&gt;sea trial&lt;/a&gt;s on 15 September 1868 and \"Northumberland\" had a maximum speed of . The ships normally carried of coal, but had a maximum capacity of , enough to steam at .\nOriginally designed with three &lt;a href=\"mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;masts&lt;/a&gt;, \"Northumberland\" was fitted with five masts until her 1875\u201379 refit when two were removed and she was re-rigged as a &lt;a href=\"barque\"&gt;barque&lt;/a&gt;. \"Northumberland\" only made under sail, mainly because the ship's propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag, the worst speed of any ironclad of her era. Admiral &lt;a href=\"George%20Alexander%20Ballard\"&gt;George A. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; described the \"Minotaur\"-class ships as \"the dullest performers under canvas of the whole masted fleet of their day, and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose.\"\nArmament.\nUnlike her half-sisters, \"Northumberland\" was armed with a mix of , , and &lt;a href=\"Muzzle-loading%20rifle\"&gt;rifled muzzle-loading guns&lt;/a&gt;. All 4 &lt;a href=\"RML%209%20inch%2012%20ton%20gun\"&gt;nine-inch&lt;/a&gt; and 18 &lt;a href=\"RML%208%20inch%209%20ton%20gun\"&gt;eight-inch&lt;/a&gt; were mounted on the main deck while 4 eight-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as &lt;a href=\"chase%20gun\"&gt;chase gun&lt;/a&gt;s. Both &lt;a href=\"RML%207%20inch%206.5%20ton%20gun\"&gt;seven-inch guns&lt;/a&gt; were mounted in the stern on the main deck, also as chase guns.\nThe nine-inch gun was credited with the ability to penetrate of &lt;a href=\"wrought%20iron\"&gt;wrought iron&lt;/a&gt; armour at the &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;muzzle&lt;/a&gt;. The eight-inch gun could penetrate of armour and the seven-inch gun could penetrate .\n\"Northumberland\" was partially rearmed in 1875 with an armament of 7 nine-inch guns, 4 on the main deck, 2 forward chase guns and 1 rear chase gun. Two eight-inch guns replaced the seven-inchers on the main deck at the stern; the other 18 eight-inch guns remained where they were. In 1886 two breech-loading guns replaced two eight-inch guns. Six &lt;a href=\"quick-firing%20gun\"&gt;quick-firing (QF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"QF%204.7%20inch%20Gun%20Mk%20I%20-%20IV\"&gt;4.7-inch (120-mm) guns&lt;/a&gt;, 10 &lt;a href=\"QF%203%20pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns&lt;/a&gt;, and six &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;s were later added.\nArmour.\nUnlike her half-sisters, the entire side of \"Northumberland\"s &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; was not covered with wrought iron armour. To compensate for the additional weight of her armament, only her &lt;a href=\"Artillery%20battery%23Naval%20usage\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt; was protected above the main deck. The ship was fitted with a complete &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;armour belt&lt;/a&gt; that tapered from at the ends to &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;. The armour extended below the waterline. The sides of the battery were long and it was protected by 5.5-inch armour on all sides, including transverse bulkheads fore and aft of the guns. The two forward chase guns on the upper deck were also protected by armoured bulkheads, but the stern chase guns on that same deck were entirely unprotected. The armour was backed by of &lt;a href=\"teak\"&gt;teak&lt;/a&gt;. The ship also had a &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; protected by 4.5-inch armour plates.\nConstruction and service.\n\"Northumberland\", named after the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20county\"&gt;ceremonial county&lt;/a&gt;, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20Ironworks\"&gt;Millwall Ironworks&lt;/a&gt;. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Millwall\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt;, London. She was altered while on the &lt;a href=\"slipway\"&gt;building slip&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Edward%20James%20Reed\"&gt;Sir Edward Reed&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Isaac Watts as &lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction\"&gt;Chief Constructor&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the &lt;a href=\"stocks%20%28shipyard%29\"&gt;stocks&lt;/a&gt; before she was ready to be &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;, partially due to frequent changes in design, although \"Northumberland\" was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by &lt;a href=\"hydraulic%20jack\"&gt;hydraulic jack&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tugboat\"&gt;tugboat&lt;/a&gt;s failed to get her into the water on the next &lt;a href=\"spring%20tide\"&gt;spring tide&lt;/a&gt; failed, but the use of &lt;a href=\"pontoon%20%28boat%29\"&gt;pontoon&lt;/a&gt;s on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized \"Northumberland\" as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Admiralty\"&gt;Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; could take possession and begin &lt;a href=\"fitting%20out\"&gt;fitting out&lt;/a&gt; the ship. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of \u00a3444,256.\nThe ship's first posting was to the Channel Squadron, where she remained until 1873. Her first captain, Roderick Dew, had all of her &lt;a href=\"yard%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;yards&lt;/a&gt; painted black so that she could be visually distinguished from her half-sisters, whose yards were white. During this time she helped her half-sister tow a &lt;a href=\"floating%20drydock\"&gt;floating drydock&lt;/a&gt; from England to &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt; where it would be picked up by and and taken to &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;. The ships departed the &lt;a href=\"Nore\"&gt;Nore&lt;/a&gt; on 23 June 1869, loaded down with of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks, and transferred the floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage.\nShe was anchored at &lt;a href=\"Funchal\"&gt;Funchal&lt;/a&gt;, Madeira, on Christmas Day 1872, when a storm parted her anchor chain and the ship drifted onto the ram bow of the ironclad . \"Northumberland\" was seriously damaged below the waterline, with one compartment flooded, though she was able to steam to &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; for repairs.\nWhile her half-sister , normally flagship of the Channel Squadron, was refitting in 1873\u201375, \"Agincourt\", normally the flagship of the fleet second-in-command, replaced her as flagship and \"Northumberland\" became flagship of the second-in-command until \"Minotaur\"s return to duty. She served as the flagship for &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"George%20Hancock%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;George Hancock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20John%20Hay%20%28Royal%20Navy%20admiral%20of%20the%20fleet%29\"&gt;Lord John Hay&lt;/a&gt;. \"Northumberland\" received her own refit and rearmament from 1875 to 1879 and rejoined the Channel Squadron upon its completion. The ship was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;paid off&lt;/a&gt; in 1885 for another refit and became the flagship of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Admiral\"&gt;Vice Admiral&lt;/a&gt;s Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Nathan%20Wrighte%20Hewett\"&gt;William Hewett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Baird%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29\"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;, successive commanders of the Channel Squadron, upon her completion in 1887.\n\"Northumberland\" was assigned to the 1st Reserve Squadron at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Portland\"&gt;Isle of Portland&lt;/a&gt; in 1890\u201391 and then at &lt;a href=\"HMNB%20Devonport\"&gt;Devonport&lt;/a&gt; from 1891 to 1898. She was &lt;a href=\"hulk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hulk&lt;/a&gt;ed in 1898 as a &lt;a href=\"Stoker%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;stoker&lt;/a&gt;s' training ship at the Nore and renamed \"Acheron\" on 1 January 1904. From 1909 to 1927 the ship served as a coal hulk at &lt;a href=\"Invergordon\"&gt;Invergordon&lt;/a&gt;, renamed \"C.8\" in 1909 and then \"C.68\" in 1926. The ship was sold in 1927, but was then resold and renamed as \"Stedmound\" for service at &lt;a href=\"Dakar\"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt; until she was scrapped in 1935.\nRelics.\nTwo large 1870s half-scale models of the ship are at the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20London%20Docklands\"&gt;Museum of London Docklands&lt;/a&gt;."
