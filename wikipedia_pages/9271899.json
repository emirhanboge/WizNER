    "text": "Algolsheim () is a &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Haut-Rhin\"&gt;Haut-Rhin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Est\"&gt;Grand Est&lt;/a&gt; in north-eastern &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThis Alsatian commune is located in the &lt;a href=\"Haut-Rhin\"&gt;Haut-Rhin&lt;/a&gt; (68) several kilometers from &lt;a href=\"Neuf-Brisach\"&gt;Neuf-Brisach&lt;/a&gt;.\nSituated from the border with &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Algolsheim includes a good number of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; residents, which has considerably increased its number of inhabitants in recent years. Algolsheim is part of the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Ensisheim\"&gt;Canton of Ensisheim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissement%20of%20Colmar-Ribeauvill%C3%A9\"&gt;Arrondissement of Colmar-Ribeauvill\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1196, the village was mentioned under the name d'Altolvisherde. From 1324 until the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, the commune was part of the holdings of the counts of &lt;a href=\"Wurtemberg\"&gt;Wurtemberg&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1870 and 1875, several &lt;a href=\"tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; were found in the territory of the commune. The village then held the name Alt-Olsheim. It owes its current name to the ease with which it can be confused with that of &lt;a href=\"Andolsheim\"&gt;Andolsheim&lt;/a&gt;. The town includes a &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;catholic&lt;/a&gt; church, a &lt;a href=\"protestant\"&gt;protestant&lt;/a&gt; temple since 1864, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Mennonite\"&gt;Mennonite&lt;/a&gt; chapel founded in 1977. Modernised &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, the principal industry of Algolsheim, maintains a healthy level, despite the increasing scarcity of farmers. More than half of the inhabitants of the commune work in the nearby industrial centers on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of new housing projects has led to an increase in the demographic diversity of the village. Algolsheim possesses a rich natural heritage, owing to the proximity of the Rhine &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; and the \u00eele du Rhin."
