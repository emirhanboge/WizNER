This pair of letters is used as a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20symbolism\"&gt;Christian symbol&lt;/a&gt;, and is often combined with the &lt;a href=\"Cross%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;Cross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chi-rho\"&gt;Chi-rho&lt;/a&gt;, or other Christian symbols.\nOrigin.\nThe first written record we have of the phrase \"alpha and omega\" is from some old manuscripts of the Christian New Testament.\nThe phrase \"I am the Alpha and the Omega\" (&lt;a href=\"Koin%C3%A9%20Greek\"&gt;Koin\u00e9 Greek&lt;/a&gt;: \"\u1f10\u03b3\u03ce \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f0c\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f6e\"), is an appellation of Jesus and of the Father in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase (\"I am the Alpha and the Omega\") is first found in Chapter 1 verse 8 (\"1:8\"), and is found in every &lt;a href=\"manuscript\"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt; of Revelation that has 1:8. Several later manuscripts repeat \"I am the Alpha and the Omega\" in 1:11 too, but do not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, &lt;a href=\"Sinaitic%20Palimpsest\"&gt;Sinaitic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Codex%20Ephraemi%20Rescriptus\"&gt;Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus&lt;/a&gt;. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to \"I am the Alpha and the Omega\" in 1:11, the \"oldest [manuscripts] omit\" it.\nA similar reference is in &lt;a href=\"Isaiah%2044%23Verse%206\"&gt;Isaiah 44&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lord says to be the first and the one who is after all.\nChristianity.\n&lt;a href=\"Alpha%20%28letter%29\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; (\u0391) and &lt;a href=\"omega%20%28letter%29\"&gt;omega&lt;/a&gt; (\u03a9) are the first and last letters, respectively, of the classical (Ionic) &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the phrase \"I am the alpha and the omega\" is further clarified with the additional phrase, \"the beginning and the end\" in Revelation 21:6, 22:13. The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet were used because the book of Revelation is in the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek.\nThis phrase is interpreted by many Christians to mean that &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; has existed for all eternity or that God is eternal. Many commentators and dictionaries ascribe the title \"the alpha and the omega\" to both God and to &lt;a href=\"Christ%20%28title%29\"&gt;Christ&lt;/a&gt;. \"Barnes' Notes on the New Testament\" (1974) claims: \"It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here ... There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such.\" Most Christian denominations also teach that the title applies to both Jesus and his Father.\nThe letters Alpha and Omega, in juxtaposition, are often used as a Christian visual symbol (see examples). The symbols were used in &lt;a href=\"early%20Christianity\"&gt;early Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and appear in the Roman &lt;a href=\"catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. The letters were shown hanging from the arms of the cross in &lt;a href=\"Early%20Christian%20art\"&gt;Early Christian art&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"crux%20gemmata\"&gt;cruces gemmatae&lt;/a&gt;, jeweled crosses in precious metal, have formed letters hanging in this way, called &lt;a href=\"pendilia\"&gt;pendilia&lt;/a&gt;; for example, in the , which is based upon the Asturian &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Cross\"&gt;Victory Cross&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, despite always being in Greek, the letters became more common in Western than &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Christian art. They are often shown to the left and right of Christ's head, sometimes within his &lt;a href=\"halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29\"&gt;halo&lt;/a&gt;, where they take the place of the &lt;a href=\"Christogram\"&gt;Christogram&lt;/a&gt; used in Orthodox art.\nJudaism.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;, the word \"emet\" (\u05d0\u05de\u05ea, meaning \"truth\"), is referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Seal%20%28emblem%29\"&gt;Seal&lt;/a&gt; of God.\" [Cf. Isaiah 44:6] The word is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20alphabet\"&gt;Hebrew alphabet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIslam.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Qur%27an\"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; gives \"al-\u02beAwwal\" (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0644), meaning \"The First\" and \"al-\u02be\u0100khir\" (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631), meaning \"The Last\" as two of the &lt;a href=\"Names%20of%20God%20in%20the%20Qur%27an\"&gt;names&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Islam\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;: .\nAPL programming language.\nSome dialects of the &lt;a href=\"APL%20%28programming%20language%29\"&gt;APL programming language&lt;/a&gt; support the &lt;a href=\"direct%20function\"&gt;direct function&lt;/a&gt; syntax where the left (optional) and right arguments are denoted by the letters alpha and omega. For example, the following function computes the sum of the left argument and twice the right argument:"
