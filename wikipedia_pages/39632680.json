    "text": "Jason Robert Quigley (born 19 May 1991) is an Irish &lt;a href=\"professional%20boxer\"&gt;professional boxer&lt;/a&gt; who challenged for the &lt;a href=\"WBO\"&gt;WBO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"middleweight\"&gt;middleweight&lt;/a&gt; title in November 2021. At regional level he held the &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Council\"&gt;WBC&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Boxing%20Federation\"&gt;NABF&lt;/a&gt; middleweight title from 2017 to 2019 and the WBO-&lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Boxing%20Organization\"&gt;NABO&lt;/a&gt; middleweight title from May to November 2021.\nAmateur career.\nQuigley had an extremely promising amateur career, which saw him rise to number one in both the &lt;a href=\"International%20Boxing%20Association%20%28amateur%29\"&gt;AIBA&lt;/a&gt; European and World amateur rankings. His place in the Ireland team had seemed secured for the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2016 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, however he decided to turn professional instead.\nIn 2009, Quigley participated in the European Youth Championships in &lt;a href=\"Szczecin\"&gt;Szezecin&lt;/a&gt;. He fought Joni Polishsuk of Finland, Catalin Paraschiveanu of Romania, Muratcan Bu\u011fra Oner of Turkey and Jaba Khocitashvili of Georgia, before defeating Emil Ahmadov of Azerbaijan 6-1 in the 69\u00a0kg final, to take home gold.\nQuigley won gold at the 2011 'Gee Bee' Multi-Nations tournament in &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, defeating English fighter &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Ogogo\"&gt;Anthony Ogogo&lt;/a&gt; 14-5 with an acclaimed performance in the final.\nQuigley boxed in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series%20of%20Boxing\"&gt;WSB&lt;/a&gt; for the 2011-2012 season. Organised by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Boxing%20Association%20%28amateur%29\"&gt;AIBA&lt;/a&gt;, the competition was designed to offer professional boxing without competitors having to forfeit their amateur status. With twelve teams fighting across the competition, it was the LA Matadors who drafted Quigley. Quigley then lived and trained in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; where he met Russian fighter Vitali Bandarenka of Moscow Dynamo in his first bout. Quigley won the fight by unanimous decision with the judges scoring them 50-45, 48-47 and 48-47 after five rounds. Quigley's second fight was against Australian, Troy Trevor O'Meley of Bankok Elephants. He won via second-round TKO, having led 10-8, 10-7, 10-8 at the end of the first.\nIn May 2012, Quigley competed at the 'Algirdas Socikas' Multi-Nations tournament in &lt;a href=\"Kaunas\"&gt;Kaunas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. He overcame Estonian fighter Artjom Fjodorov, 16-6, and Lithuanian fighter Mantas Balciauskas, 11-3, before taking gold against Denmark's Matouk Belai with another dominant 18-5 win in the final. Quigley won his next gold at the 2012 European U23 Championships, in &lt;a href=\"Kaliningrad\"&gt;Kaliningrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. He met Germany's Dennis Radovan in the final, winning by a 17-11 decision at Kaliningrad\u2019s Sports Palace. Quigley defeated Russian southpaw Maksim Timofeev and Moldova's Victor Carapchevschii in the previous rounds.\nIn March 2013, Quigley took gold at the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Ast%C3%AD%20nad%20Labem\"&gt;\u00dast\u00ed nad Labem&lt;/a&gt; Grand Prix in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. He beat Czech native Vit Kral by a score of 20-6 in his first fight, before defeating Chinese fighter Zhou Yunfei 14-7. In the final, he met Serbia's &lt;a href=\"Aleksandar%20Drenovak\"&gt;Aleksandar Drenovak&lt;/a&gt; for another 14-6 victory.\nIn June, he won gold again in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20European%20Amateur%20Boxing%20Championships\"&gt;European Amateur Boxing Championships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;. Quigley beat world number one &lt;a href=\"Evhen%20Khytrov\"&gt;Evhen Khytrov&lt;/a&gt;, before defeating &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Juratoni\"&gt;Bogdan Juratoni&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"middleweight\"&gt;middleweight&lt;/a&gt; final. The Romanian had previously been a bronze medalist in the tournament.\nQuigley's final amateur medal came in October, when he claimed silver at the &lt;a href=\"2013%20AIBA%20World%20Boxing%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Middleweight\"&gt;World Amateur Boxing Championships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Almaty\"&gt;Almaty&lt;/a&gt;. In the semi-finals, Quigley took all three rounds in a victory over Russian boxer &lt;a href=\"Artem%20Chebotarev\"&gt;Artem Chebotarev&lt;/a&gt;. In the other semi-final, Englishman &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Fowler\"&gt;Anthony Fowler&lt;/a&gt; was forced to give his opponent a walkover after suffering a hand injury in the lead up to the fight. As a result, Quigley met the much fresher &lt;a href=\"Zhanibek%20Alimkhanuly\"&gt;Zhanibek Alimkhanuly&lt;/a&gt; in the following day's final. The local Kazakh fighter took gold with a narrow win, in what was Quigley's first loss in an 18-month run of 33 fights.\nProfessional career.\nIn April 2014, it was announced that Quigley was turning professional and had signed a promotional contract with &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Boy%20Promotions\"&gt;Golden Boy Promotions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. After signing, Golden Boy founder and president, &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20De%20La%20Hoya\"&gt;Oscar De La Hoya&lt;/a&gt; said \"Jason Quigley is part of the next generation of European boxers who are about to make their mark on the international stage\". He went on to say \"It also doesn\u2019t hurt that he has the great nation of Ireland behind him, and I know they will support him wherever he goes.\"\nQuigley made his professional debut on 12 July 2014 as a &lt;a href=\"middleweight\"&gt;middleweight&lt;/a&gt;, against Howard Reece at the &lt;a href=\"MGM%20Grand%20Garden%20Arena\"&gt;MGM Grand Garden Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. The fight featured on the undercard of &lt;a href=\"Saul%20Alvarez\"&gt;Canelo&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=\"Erislandy%20Lara\"&gt;Lara&lt;/a&gt;, and Quigley won the bout via TKO, just 82 seconds into the first round. \"I\u2019m absolutely buzzing\", Quigley said afterwards. \"I\u2019m delighted to be on a show like this and to win is unbelievable\".\nQuigley's second professional win came against Fernando Najera, with Najera's corner ending it in the third round.\nOn 30 October 2014, Quigley continued his unbeaten start to professional boxing. Fighting in &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Plymouth, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, an area rich with Irish support, Quigley fought Greg McCoy. The fight did not make it out of the first round, with a Quigley left hook, right straight combination sending McCoy to the canvas just 2 minutes and 39 seconds into the bout.\nQuigley's first fight of 2015 came as part of Golden Boy's \"LA Fight Club\", this time held at the Belasco Theatre in Los Angeles. Quigley's opponent was Lanny Dardar in the final fight of the night, and in yet another completely one sided contest, the American received two standing eight counts before an inevitable stoppage just 93 seconds into the first round.\nJust two weeks later, Quigley was back in the ring again, this time facing Tolutomi Agunbiade at the &lt;a href=\"Fantasy%20Springs%20Resort%20Casino\"&gt;Fantasy Springs Resort Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Indio%2C%20California\"&gt;Indio, California&lt;/a&gt;. The fight was another dominant performance from Quigley, with the referee stepping in 1 minute and 43 seconds into the second round, when it became obvious that Agunbiade was no longer capable of defending himself. On 30 April, Quigley returned to the Fantasy Springs Resort to face Joshua Snyder. 44 seconds into round 2, Quigley caught him with a vicious left hook, and followed it up with another big right to confirm the KO over Snyder who was already spiraling towards the canvas.\nHis next fight was against Mississippi based, Tom Howard. Quigley fought him on 11 July 2015, at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Sports%20Arena\"&gt;Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The American had won 8 of his 11 professional fights, and had never been KO'd in his career. Despite this, Quigley picked up where he had left off against Joshua Snyder, outclassing his opponent from the first bell. Howard had to pick himself off the canvas twice during the fight, before the referee eventually stepped in and put an end to it in the second round.\nAs he returned to the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino for the third time, Quigley fought Michael Faulk, his first southpaw opponent in pro boxing. In a night where &lt;a href=\"The%20Ring%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;The Ring TV&lt;/a&gt; commentators dubbed him \"El Animal\", Quigley continued his perfect record, scoring another emphatic second-round knockout. After a less eventful opening round in which Quigley used his jab and straight right to good effect, Faulk was sent to the canvas three times in the second. Faulk's threw the towel in.\nQuigley was taken the distance for the first time in his pro career, when he faced Marchristopher Adkins at the &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Rock%20Hotel%20and%20Casino\"&gt;Hard Rock Hotel and Casino&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas. The American, unbeaten since his first professional bout, was on a six fight win streak in which he became the first fighter to defeat &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Mosley%23Personal%20life\"&gt;Shane Mosley Jr&lt;/a&gt;. Quigley took the four-rounder via Unanimous Decision.\nIn February 2016, Golden Boy V.P. Eric Perez confirmed that Quigley would be returning to the ring in late March on another card at Fantasy Springs. Perez stated \"he'll fight there and then after that we'll bring him back, possibly on the Canelo card.\" Canelo is booked to defend his titles against England's &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Khan%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Amir Khan&lt;/a&gt;, at the new &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile%20Arena%20%28Las%20Vegas%29\"&gt;T-Mobile Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas.On 26 March, Quigley took on Freddy Lopez, who stepped in as a late replacement for Dante Moore. The fight was another quick finish for Quigley, with him targeting the body from the bell and scoring a knockdown in the first minute. Lopez stood back to his feet only for Quigley to continue the onslaught to his body. It wasn't long before Lopez was down again, giving Quigley another first-round knockout. The victory brought Quigley's record to 10-0, with 9 knockouts.\nOn 7 May, in just his 11th pro fight, Quigley took a major step up in class on the undercard of &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%BAl%20%C3%81lvarez%20vs.%20Amir%20Khan\"&gt;Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez vs. Amir Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Quigley faced the then 23-3 &lt;a href=\"James%20de%20la%20Rosa\"&gt;James de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; of Mexico, who came in with two camps worth of preparation, having previously been scheduled to face &lt;a href=\"David%20Lemieux%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;David Lemieux&lt;/a&gt; in March. With Lemieux missing the contracted weight, their fight was scrapped and de la Rosa was instead booked to face Quigley in the Irishman's first 10-round fight. Despite Quigley previously going no further than 4 rounds, he passed his test with flying colors, using quick footwork, precise power punching, and disciplined boxing to hurt and outbox De la Rosa for a dominant and one-sided unanimous decision victory. All three judges scored the fight 100-90.\nOn 17 December 2016, Quigley fought on the undercard of &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Hopkins\"&gt;Bernard Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; last fight against &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Smith%20Jr.\"&gt;Joe Smith Jr.&lt;/a&gt;. Quigley faced hard-punching Puerto Rican Jorge Melendez (30-7, 28 KO's). Melendez came out fast but Quigley was able to counter him and Melendez was dropped 3 times in the first round before his corner threw in the towel.\nQuigley vs. Tapia.\nOn 23 March 2017, Golden Boy had its first televised card on ESPN following their multi-year deal with the network. The main event featured Quigley taking on &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Tapia\"&gt;Glen Tapia&lt;/a&gt;, in what was Quigley's first time ever headlining a nationally televised boxing card. Quigley rocked Tapia badly with a right hand to the chin in the first round, and again with a right hand to the body in the second, but at some point in the second round, Quigley broke his right hand on a shot to the top of Tapia's head, which resulted in a torn tendon. From this point forward, Quigley could not be as effective with his right hand punches, and it became a fight of attrition. Quigley went back to boxing on the back foot and his superior technical skills earned him another wide unanimous decision (98-92, 99-91, 100-90).\nGaelic games.\nQuigley also plays &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hurling\"&gt;hurling&lt;/a&gt; with his local club Se\u00e1n MacCumhaills."
