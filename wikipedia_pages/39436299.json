    "text": "SM \"UB-110\" was a German &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20UB%20III%20submarine\"&gt;Type UB III submarine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;German Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; () during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\n\"UB-110\" was built by &lt;a href=\"Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss\"&gt;Blohm &amp; Voss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. After just under a year of construction, it was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; at Hamburg on 1 September 1917 and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1918 under the command of \"Kptlt.\" Werner F\u00fcrbringer. Like all Type UB III submarines, \"UB-110\" carried ten &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and was armed with an &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;, carried a crew of three officers and up to 31 men, and had a cruising range of . It had a displacement of while surfaced and when submerged. Its engines enabled it to travel at when surfaced and when submerged.\nShips hit by UB-110.\nDuring its lifetime, UB-110 is confirmed to have torpedoed two ships, the \"Sprucol\" and the \"Southborough\". The \"Sprucol\" was a 1,137 ton tanker being operated by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; at the time of engagement, when it was damaged off the English coast but made it back to the &lt;a href=\"Humber\"&gt;Humber&lt;/a&gt; with no casualties. The 3,709 ton civilian steamer \"Southborough\" was not to be so lucky, sunk 5 miles off the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt; on 16 July 1918 with the loss of 30 civilian lives.\nSinking.\nThe submarine was &lt;a href=\"commission%20%28ship%29\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;ed into the German Imperial Navy on 23 March 1918 as SM \"UB-110\".\nOn 19 July 1918, while under the command of \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" &lt;a href=\"Werner%20F%C3%BCrbringer\"&gt;Werner F\u00fcrbringer&lt;/a&gt;, \"UB-110\" was depth charged, rammed, and sunk near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne\"&gt;Tyne&lt;/a&gt; by , commanded by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lightoller\"&gt;Charles Lightoller&lt;/a&gt;. This was possibly the last U-boat sinking during the Great War.\nIn his postwar memoirs, F\u00fcrbringer alleged that, after the sinking, \"HMS Garry\" hove to and opened fire with revolvers and machine guns on the unarmed crew in the water. He states that he saw the skull of his 18-year old steward split open by a lump of coal hurled by a member of \"Garry's\" crew. He also states that when he attempted to help a wounded officer to swim, the man said, \"Let me die in peace. The swine are going to murder us anyhow.\" The memoir states that the shooting ceased only when the convoy that the destroyer had been escorting, and that contained many neutral-flagged ships, arrived on the scene, at which point \"as if by magic the British now let down some life boats into the water.\" Lieutenant Commander Lightoller was awarded a bar to his &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Distinguished Service Cross&lt;/a&gt; for sinking \"UB-110\". A total of 23 members of \"UB-110\"'s crew died in the action, some, according to F\u00fcrbringer, at the hands of \"Garry's\" crew after the sinking.\nRescue operation.\n&lt;a href=\"HMS%20Bonetta%20%281907%29\"&gt;HMTBD Bonetta&lt;/a&gt; arrived late on the scene and picked up five survivors, including the Captain, but one of them, the Engineer Officer, died on deck immediately after being taken out of the water. The German captain, despite the ordeal he had come through, proved himself to be a very self-possessed individual when examined in the chart room. He expressed the opinion that Germany would shortly win the war, but he was a long way out in his calculation, as Germany was defeated six weeks later. Some of his sailors had not the same guts, but had got on their knees and begged for their lives on seeing officers of the \"Bonetta\" carrying arms. &lt;a href=\"Webley%20%26amp%3B%20Scott\"&gt;Webley &amp; Scott&lt;/a&gt; automatic pistols hanging round their necks by &lt;a href=\"lanyard\"&gt;lanyard&lt;/a&gt;s were always put on when 'action' was sounded. The \"Bonetta\"'s duties around that time had included picking up many, badly wounded, survivors, and dead, from fishing boats, which had been shelled by a German submarine, off the entrance to the Tyne. Perhaps unsurprisingly the crew of the \"Bonetta\" were not made aware of any massacre.\nBoat raised.\n\"UB-110\" was raised on 4 October 1918 and &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Swan%20Hunter\"&gt;Swan Hunter&lt;/a&gt; shipyard on the Tyne. An album of photographs of the vessel has been shared by &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear%20Archives\"&gt;Tyne and Wear Archives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/sets/72157633570788096/\"&gt;\"The sinking and raising of UB-110\"&lt;/a&gt;\nAn unsettling discovery during its salvage was that some of its torpedoes were fitted with &lt;a href=\"Magnetic%20pistol\"&gt;magnetic firing pistols&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the first to be properly identified by the British. These early examples were problematic, often detonating their weapons prematurely if at all."
