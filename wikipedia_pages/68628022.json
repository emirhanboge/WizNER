It has begun its production in end of 2019 but was halted due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.

Avasarala plays Gotti Surya Narayana, a 37-year old bachelor who has a bald head. Ruhani Sharma plays his love interest. The makers have denied the speculations that the film was a remake of the Hindi film &lt;a href=\"Bala%20%282019%20film%29\"&gt;\"Bala\"&lt;/a&gt; (2019), stating it was conceived before the latter's release.

A pre-release event was conducted on 30 August 2021.\nReception.\nSangeetha Devi Dundoo of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hindu\"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that: \"\"Nootokka\"\u2026 is well intentioned and handles issues with sensitivity. But it doesn\u2019t have the spark with which Avasarala wrote \"&lt;a href=\"Oohalu%20Gusagusalade\"&gt;Oohalu Gusagusalade&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Jyo%20Achyutananda\"&gt;Jo Atchyutananda&lt;/a&gt;\".\" Dundoo appreciated the performances of Avasarala, Sharma and Rohini, and opined that the latter was capable of making a difference in crucial scenes. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times%20of%20India\"&gt;The Times of India&lt;/a&gt;\" critic Sravan Vanaparthy rated the film 3/5 and wrote: \"Nootokka Jillala Andagadu is a popcorn entertainer with a message to convey about body shaming.\"\nAnji Shetty of &lt;a href=\"Sakshi%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;\"Sakshi\"&lt;/a&gt; praised the performances of Avasarala and Sharma, and opined that humour and emotions were main drivers of the film. Shetty, however, felt that routine story and climax have let down the film. A reviewer from \"&lt;a href=\"Eenadu\"&gt;Eenadu&lt;/a&gt;\" also echoed the same, writing that director Vidyasagar's flat narration style could not carry the screenplay and emotion properly. \"&lt;a href=\"Namasthe%20Telangana\"&gt;Namasthe Telangana&lt;/a&gt;\" critic lauded the novel attempt by the makers but felt that screenplay was not convincing enough. \nSuresh Rachamalla of &lt;a href=\"News18%20Telugu\"&gt;News18 Telugu&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, stated that the writing, direction and performances have done justice for the film. \"&lt;a href=\"Samayam%20Telugu\"&gt;Samayam Telugu&lt;/a&gt;\" reviewer Sekher Kusuma also wrote that the screenplay was gripping and entertaining, while also appreciating the music and choreography."
