    "text": "The Battle of &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt;-Huangqiao (Ru Huang Zhangdou, \u5982\u9ec4\u6218\u6597) was a battle fought between the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;nationalists&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in the post &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; era and resulted in &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; victory. The battle was a one seven major battles in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Jiangsu%20Campaign\"&gt;Central Jiangsu Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrder of battle\nAfter battles fought at Dingyan (\u4e01\u5830) and Linxin (\u6797\u6893) in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Jiangsu%20Campaign\"&gt;Central Jiangsu Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the communists had severed the &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Nantong\"&gt;Nantong&lt;/a&gt; Highway, and the nationalist 187th Brigade defending &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt; was isolated. To avert the situation, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division was ordered to be deployed from the Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, \u9ec4\u6865) Town to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division deployed at &lt;a href=\"Yangzhou\"&gt;Yangzhou&lt;/a&gt; and Jiangdu (\u6c5f\u90fd) was ordered to attack Shaobo (\u90b5\u4f2f) in the north. The communist, in response, ordered their 1st Division, 6th Division, 5th Brigade and the Specialized Regiment to attack &lt;a href=\"Taizhou%2C%20Jiangsu\"&gt;Taizhou, Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt; from Dingyan (\u4e01\u5830) and Linxin (\u6797\u6893) regions, in the hope of luring the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division to abandon its attack on Shaobo (\u90b5\u4f2f) and reinforce &lt;a href=\"Taizhou%2C%20Jiangsu\"&gt;Taizhou, Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt;, so that it could be ambushed on its way. Although the communist plan succeeded in forcing the nationalists to abandon their attack on Shaobo (\u90b5\u4f2f), the planned ambush of the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division failed to materialize. Instead, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division became the unfortunate victim.\nIn the morning of August 25, 1946, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division begun its march toward &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt; from Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, \u9ec4\u6865) Town, with nationalist 187th Brigade and a regiment of the nationalist 79th Brigade coming out of &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt; to meet their comrades-in-arms. By the noon, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division met the communist main force on the road from Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, \u9ec4\u6865) Town to &lt;a href=\"Rugao\"&gt;Rugao&lt;/a&gt;. The communist 1st Division and 6th Division immediately launched their assault on the nationalists, successfully besieging the enemy in isolated pockets in the regions of Fenjie (\u5206\u754c) and Jiali (\u52a0\u529b). The communists decided to concentrate their forces 4 to 5 times than that of their enemy to annihilate the weakest enemy first, and then the stronger one.\nOn August 26, 1946, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division at Fenjie (\u5206\u754c) region was first to be completely annihilated, and on the next day, the nationalist 187th Brigade and a regiment of the nationalist 79th Brigade at Jiali (\u52a0\u529b) region was also annihilated completely. The victorious communists then launched their assault on Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, \u9ec4\u6865) Town, and remaining 5 companies of the nationalist 160th Brigade simply could not challenge the overwhelmingly superior enemy force, and gave up the town and surrendered. With the fall of Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, \u9ec4\u6865) Town, the nationalists was forced to cease their offensive to regroup for the next stage of the campaign and the battle ended."
