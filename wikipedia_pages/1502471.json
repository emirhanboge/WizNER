    "text": "Prehistoric music (previously primitive music) is a term in the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20music\"&gt;history of music&lt;/a&gt; for all &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; produced in &lt;a href=\"literate\"&gt;preliterate&lt;/a&gt; cultures (&lt;a href=\"prehistory\"&gt;prehistory&lt;/a&gt;), beginning somewhere in very late &lt;a href=\"Geological%20history%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;geological history&lt;/a&gt;. Prehistoric music is followed by &lt;a href=\"ancient%20music\"&gt;ancient music&lt;/a&gt; in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music which still survives as &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt;, indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within &lt;a href=\"music%20archaeology\"&gt;music archaeology&lt;/a&gt;. \nFindings from &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic%20flutes\"&gt;Paleolithic flutes&lt;/a&gt; carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The disputed &lt;a href=\"Divje%20Babe%20flute\"&gt;Divje Babe flute&lt;/a&gt;, carved from a &lt;a href=\"cave%20bear\"&gt;cave bear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"femur\"&gt;femur&lt;/a&gt;, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of &lt;a href=\"String%20instrument\"&gt;stringed instruments&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ravanahatha\"&gt;Ravanahatha&lt;/a&gt;, have been recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; sites. India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world\u2014references to &lt;a href=\"Indian%20classical%20music\"&gt;Indian classical music&lt;/a&gt; (\"marga\") are found in the &lt;a href=\"Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt;, ancient scriptures of the &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; tradition. The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and dates back to between 7000 and 6600\u00a0BCE.\nOrigins of prehistoric instruments.\nThe use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music', as we understand it, was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. Some cultures have certain instances of their &lt;a href=\"Sound%20mimesis%20in%20various%20cultures\"&gt;music intending to imitate natural sounds&lt;/a&gt;. In some instances, this feature is related to &lt;a href=\"Imitation%20of%20sounds%20in%20shamanism\"&gt;shamanistic beliefs or practice&lt;/a&gt;. It may also serve entertainment (game) or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt).\nIt is likely that the first &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;musical instrument&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"human%20voice\"&gt;human voice&lt;/a&gt; itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hum%20%28sound%29\"&gt;hum&lt;/a&gt;ming and &lt;a href=\"whistling\"&gt;whistling&lt;/a&gt; through to &lt;a href=\"Click%20consonant\"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"cough\"&gt;cough&lt;/a&gt;ing and &lt;a href=\"yawn\"&gt;yawn&lt;/a&gt;ing. (See Darwin\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20Species\"&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;\" on music and speech.) The oldest known &lt;a href=\"Neanderthal\"&gt;Neanderthal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hyoid\"&gt;hyoid&lt;/a&gt; bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old, predating the oldest known &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic%20flutes\"&gt;Paleolithic bone flute&lt;/a&gt; by some 20,000 years, but the true chronology may date back much further.\nMusic can be theoretically traced to prior to the &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; age. The &lt;a href=\"anthropological\"&gt;anthropological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archaeological\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by &lt;a href=\"Hominidae\"&gt;hominid&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"noise\"&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;s produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal are a likely source of rhythm created by early humans. The first rhythm instruments or &lt;a href=\"percussion%20instruments\"&gt;percussion instruments&lt;/a&gt; most likely involved the &lt;a href=\"clapping\"&gt;clapping&lt;/a&gt; of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create &lt;a href=\"rhythm\"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are currently open to interpretation include pierced &lt;a href=\"phalanges\"&gt;phalanges&lt;/a&gt; (usually interpreted as \"phalangeal &lt;a href=\"whistle\"&gt;whistle&lt;/a&gt;s\"), &lt;a href=\"Bullroarer%20%28music%29\"&gt;bullroarers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rasp\"&gt;rasp&lt;/a&gt;s. These musical instruments date back as far as the &lt;a href=\"paleolithic\"&gt;paleolithic&lt;/a&gt;, although there is some ambiguity over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. \nAnother possible origin of music is &lt;a href=\"motherese\"&gt;motherese&lt;/a&gt;, the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.\nMiller suggests musical displays play a role in \"demonstrating fitness to mate\". Based on the ideas of &lt;a href=\"honest%20signal\"&gt;honest signal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"handicap%20principle\"&gt;handicap principle&lt;/a&gt;, Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dancing\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; individual to the prospective mates. Communal singing by both sexes occurs among &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20breeding\"&gt;cooperatively breeding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Songbird\"&gt;songbirds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Australian%20magpie\"&gt;magpies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"white-browed%20sparrow-weaver\"&gt;white-browed sparrow-weaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaeoacoustic methodology.\nThe field of &lt;a href=\"archaeoacoustics\"&gt;archaeoacoustics&lt;/a&gt; uses acoustic techniques to explore prehistoric sounds, soundscapes, and instruments; it has included the study of ringing rocks and &lt;a href=\"Lithophone\"&gt;lithophones&lt;/a&gt;, of the acoustics of ritual sites such as chamber tombs and stone circles, and the exploration of prehistoric instruments using acoustic testing. Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology.\nAfrica.\nEgypt.\nIn &lt;a href=\"prehistoric%20Egypt\"&gt;prehistoric Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Egyptians\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; credited the goddess &lt;a href=\"Bat%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Bat&lt;/a&gt; with the invention of &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of &lt;a href=\"Hathor\"&gt;Hathor&lt;/a&gt; because both were depicted as cows. Hathor's music was believed to have been used by &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; as part of his effort to civilise the world. The lion-goddess &lt;a href=\"Bastet\"&gt;Bastet&lt;/a&gt; was also considered a goddess of music. Rhythms during this time were unvaried and music served to create rhythm. Small shells were used as whistles. During the predynastic period of Egyptian history, funerary chants continued to play an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Clapper%20%28musical%20instrument%29\"&gt;clappers&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the lack of physical evidence in some cases, Egyptologists theorise that the development of certain instruments known of the Old Kingdom period, such as the end-blown flute, took place during this time.\nAsia.\nChina.\nIn 1986, several &lt;a href=\"Gudi%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;gudi&lt;/a&gt; (literally \"bone flutes\") were found in &lt;a href=\"Jiahu\"&gt;Jiahu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Henan\"&gt;Henan Province&lt;/a&gt;, China. They date to about 7000 BCE. They have between 6 and 9 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the &lt;a href=\"red-crowned%20crane\"&gt;red-crowned crane&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of &lt;a href=\"Xia%20Zhi\"&gt;Xia Zhi&lt;/a&gt; and six-note scale of &lt;a href=\"Qing%20Shang\"&gt;Qing Shang&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20musical%20system\"&gt;Chinese musical system&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndia.\nIndia has the oldest musical traditions in the world\u2014references to &lt;a href=\"Indian%20classical%20music\"&gt;Indian classical music&lt;/a&gt; (\"marga\") are found in the &lt;a href=\"Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt;, ancient scriptures of the &lt;a href=\"Hindu\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; tradition. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of &lt;a href=\"String%20instrument\"&gt;stringed instruments&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ravanahatha\"&gt;Ravanahatha&lt;/a&gt;, have been recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; sites.\nAustralia.\n Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander music includes the music of &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australian\"&gt;Aboriginal Australian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islanders\"&gt;Torres Strait Islanders&lt;/a&gt;. Music has formed an integral part of the &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; and ceremonial observances of these people, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day, and has existed for 40,000 years. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;ation which are unique to particular regions or &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Indigenous%20Australian%20group%20names\"&gt;Indigenous Australian groups&lt;/a&gt;; there are equally elements of musical tradition which are common or widespread through much of the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.\nTraditional instruments.\nDidgeridoo.\nA &lt;a href=\"didgeridoo\"&gt;didgeridoo&lt;/a&gt; is a type of &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;musical instrument&lt;/a&gt; that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of &lt;a href=\"aerophone\"&gt;aerophone&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It consists of a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are traditionally made of &lt;a href=\"eucalyptus\"&gt;eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt;, but contemporary materials such as PVC piping are used. In traditional situations it is played only by men, usually as an accompaniment to ceremonial or recreational singing, or, much more rarely, as a solo instrument. Skilled players use the technique of circular breathing to achieve a continuous sound, and also employ techniques for inducing multiple harmonic resonances. Although traditionally the instrument was not widespread around the country \u2013 it was only used by Aboriginal groups in the most northerly areas .\nClapsticks.\nA &lt;a href=\"clapstick\"&gt;clapstick&lt;/a&gt; is a type of &lt;a href=\"musical%20instrument\"&gt;musical instrument&lt;/a&gt; that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of percussion. Unlike &lt;a href=\"drum%20stick\"&gt;drumsticks&lt;/a&gt;, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another, and people as well. They are of oval shape with paintings of snakes, lizards, birds and more.\nGum leaf.\nUsed as a hand-held free reed instrument.\nBull Roarer.\nA bullroarer consists of a weighted &lt;a href=\"airfoil\"&gt;airfoil&lt;/a&gt; (a rectangular thin slat of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; about (6\u00a0in) to (24\u00a0in) long and about (0.5\u00a0in) to (2\u00a0in) wide) attached to a long &lt;a href=\"rope\"&gt;cord&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, the wood slat is trimmed down to a sharp edge around the edges, and serrations along the length of the wooden slat may or may not be used, depending on the cultural traditions of the region in question.\nThe cord is given a slight initial twist, and the roarer is then swung in a large circle in a horizontal plane, or in a smaller circle in a vertical plane. The &lt;a href=\"aerodynamics\"&gt;aerodynamics&lt;/a&gt; of the roarer will keep it spinning about its axis even after the initial twist has unwound. The cord winds fully first in one direction and then the other, alternating. \nIt makes a characteristic roaring &lt;a href=\"vibrato\"&gt;vibrato&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; with notable sound modulations occurring from the rotation of the roarer along its longitudinal axis, and the choice of whether a shorter or longer length of cord is used to spin the bullroarer. By modifying the expansiveness of its circuit and the speed given it, and by changing the plane in which the bullroarer is whirled from horizontal to vertical or vice versa, the modulation of the sound produced can be controlled, making the coding of information possible. \nThe low-frequency component of the sound travels extremely long distances, clearly audible over many miles on a quiet night.\nVarious cultures have used bullroarers as musical, ritual, and religious instruments and long-range communication devices for at least 19,000 years.\nBullroarers have been used in &lt;a href=\"initiation%20ceremony\"&gt;initiation ceremonies&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"burial\"&gt;burial&lt;/a&gt;s to ward off evil spirits, bad tidings, and especially women and children. \nBullroarers are considered secret men's business by all or almost all Aboriginal tribal groups, and hence forbidden for women, children, non-initiated men, or outsiders to even hear. Fison and Howitt documented this in \"Kamilaroi and Kurnai\" (page 198). Anyone caught breaching the imposed secrecy was to be punished by death.\nThey are used in men's initiation ceremonies, and the sound they produce is considered in some indigenous cultures to represent the sound of the &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20Serpent\"&gt;Rainbow Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. In the cultures of southeastern Australia, the sound of the bullroarer is the voice of &lt;a href=\"Daramulan\"&gt;Daramulan&lt;/a&gt;, and a successful bullroarer can only be made if it has been cut from a tree containing his spirit.\nUse of Bullroarers have also been documented in Ancient Greece, Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Mali, New Zealand, and the Americas, \"see &lt;a href=\"Bullroarer\"&gt;Bullroarer&lt;/a&gt;\". Banks Island Eskimos were still using Bullroarers, circa 1963, 59 year old \"Susie\" scaring off four polar bears armed only with three seal hooks as such and vocals. Aleut, Eskimo and Inuit used bullroarers occasionally as a children's toy or musical instruments, but preferred drums and rattles.\nEurope.\nGermany.\nIn 2008, archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the &lt;a href=\"Hohle%20Fels\"&gt;Hohle Fels&lt;/a&gt; cave near &lt;a href=\"Ulm\"&gt;Ulm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone. The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal \"&lt;a href=\"Nature%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;\" in June 2009. It is one of several similar instruments found in the area, which date to at least 35,000 years ago, making this one of the oldest confirmed finds of any musical instruments in history. The Hohle Fels flute was found next to the &lt;a href=\"Venus%20of%20Hohle%20Fels\"&gt;Venus of Hohle Fels&lt;/a&gt; and a short distance from the oldest known &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; carving. On announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the \"finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe\". Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may help to explain why early humans survived, while &lt;a href=\"Neanderthals\"&gt;Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt; became extinct.\nGreece.\nOn the island of &lt;a href=\"Keros\"&gt;Keros&lt;/a&gt; (\u039a\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), two marble statues from the late &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; culture called &lt;a href=\"Early%20Cycladic%20culture\"&gt;Early Cycladic culture&lt;/a&gt; (2900\u20132000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing &lt;a href=\"aulos\"&gt;double flute&lt;/a&gt; player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped &lt;a href=\"lyre\"&gt;lyre&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"harp\"&gt;harp&lt;/a&gt;. The harpist is approximately high and dates to around 2700\u20132500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from &lt;a href=\"mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt;.\nIreland.\nThe oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in &lt;a href=\"Wicklow\"&gt;Wicklow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, in the winter of 2003, carbon-dated at around 2167\u00b130 BCE. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.\nSlovenia.\nThe oldest &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; ever discovered may be the so-called Divje Babe flute, found in the Cerkno Hills, &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, though this is disputed. The item in question is a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"femur\"&gt;femur&lt;/a&gt; of a juvenile &lt;a href=\"cave%20bear\"&gt;cave bear&lt;/a&gt;, and has been dated to about 43,000 years ago. However, whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore-chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate. In 2012 some flutes, that were discovered years earlier in the &lt;a href=\"Gei%C3%9Fenkl%C3%B6sterle\"&gt;Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle cave&lt;/a&gt;, received a new high-resolution carbon-dating examination yielding an age of 42,000 to 43,000 years.\nThe Americas.\nCanada.\nFor thousands of years, Canada has been inhabited by Indigenous Peoples from a variety of &lt;a href=\"Classification%20of%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;different cultures&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;several major linguistic groupings&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the Indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. &lt;a href=\"Chanting\"&gt;Chanting&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 singing is widely popular, with many of its performers also using a variety of musical instruments. They used the materials at hand to make their instruments for thousands of years before Europeans immigrated to the &lt;a href=\"new%20world\"&gt;new world&lt;/a&gt;. They made &lt;a href=\"gourds\"&gt;gourds&lt;/a&gt; and animal &lt;a href=\"Blowing%20horn\"&gt;horns&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Rattle%20%28percussion%20instrument%29\"&gt;rattles&lt;/a&gt; which were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of &lt;a href=\"birchbark\"&gt;birchbark&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"drum%20stick\"&gt;drumsticks&lt;/a&gt; of carved &lt;a href=\"antlers\"&gt;antlers&lt;/a&gt; and wood. &lt;a href=\"Drums\"&gt;Drums&lt;/a&gt; were generally made of carved wood and &lt;a href=\"animal%20hides\"&gt;animal hides&lt;/a&gt;. These musical instruments provide the background for songs and dances."
