    "text": "Nueces Bay is a northwestern extension of &lt;a href=\"Corpus%20Christi%20Bay\"&gt;Corpus Christi Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Patricio%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Patricio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nueces%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Nueces&lt;/a&gt; Counties of Texas. The bay is fed by the &lt;a href=\"Nueces%20River\"&gt;Nueces River&lt;/a&gt;, forming a natural &lt;a href=\"estuary\"&gt;estuary&lt;/a&gt;, which renders it ecologically and economically vital to the surrounding area. It serves as a habitat for the propagation of fish and shellfish, which sustain diverse species of birds and other wildlife. The bay is threatened by pollution from the &lt;a href=\"heavy%20industry\"&gt;heavy industry&lt;/a&gt; on its southern shore, which prevents oyster farming. Petrochemical production and oil are important to the surrounding economies of the major settlements of &lt;a href=\"Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Corpus Christi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, found on the eastern shore and connected by the Nueces Bay Causeway at the bay's &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; with Corpus Christi Bay.\nAgriculture dominates the northern shore, where many plots of land are still owned by the descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of &lt;a href=\"Rosita%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rosita&lt;/a&gt; and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by &lt;a href=\"Rincon%20Bayou\"&gt;Rincon Bayou&lt;/a&gt; and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth are the remains of the abandoned Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits.\nHistory.\nNueces Bay formed around 9,000 years ago, as the sea level rose at the conclusion of the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin Bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the &lt;a href=\"Karankawa\"&gt;Karankawa Indians&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.\n\"Nueces\" is &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"nuts\", and refers to the &lt;a href=\"pecan%20tree\"&gt;pecan tree&lt;/a&gt;s that grew along the banks of the Nueces River, noted by Spanish explorer &lt;a href=\"Alonso%20De%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Alonso De Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in 1689. It is unclear when the name was given to the bay; it was called \"San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel\" by Spanish captain Joaqu\u00edn de Orobio y Basterra in 1747, and an 1835 map of Texas identified it as \"Papelote\" or \"wastepaper\" Bay. It appears to have been first noted on a Spanish map in 1527 as the mouth of the \"R\u00edo Escondido\" or hidden river, which is believed to be the Nueces. French explorer &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle&lt;/a&gt; sailed into the bay in 1685, mistakenly believing it was the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. Spanish colonial governor &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Escand%C3%B3n\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; planned a \"&lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;\" on the mouth of the Nueces River named Villa de Vedoya. About 50 families were sent to the site in 1749, but they failed to establish a settlement due to a lack of sufficient supplies. Later that century, &lt;a href=\"missionaries\"&gt;missionaries&lt;/a&gt; discussed the possibility of moving &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20missions%20in%20Texas%23Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20del%20Refugio%20Mission\"&gt;Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Refugio Mission&lt;/a&gt; to the site, but decided against the idea due to conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Lipan%20Apache%20people\"&gt;Lipan Apache&lt;/a&gt;s. Germans attempted to settle the same area, but were turned away by the French during the &lt;a href=\"Pastry%20War\"&gt;Pastry War&lt;/a&gt; in the 1830s. The next decade, a colony for freed slaves was proposed by abolitionist &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Lundy\"&gt;Benjamin Lundy&lt;/a&gt;, who had to cancel after the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Revolution\"&gt;Texas Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorpus Christi, which was founded as a &lt;a href=\"trading%20post\"&gt;trading post&lt;/a&gt; on the southeastern shore in 1839, is believed to be the first permanent settlement on the bay. It soon grew into a major Texas port with a population of 277,454 at the time of the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2000 census&lt;/a&gt;. In 1852, a settlement was finally established at the &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Kinney\"&gt;Henry Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, who also founded Corpus Christi. The community was referred to as \"the Motts\" by German and English settlers for nearby tree clusters, but was officially known as Nuecestown. It was raided by Mexican bandits in 1875, but recovered and grew to a population of 200 by 1896. After the railroad passed on the town in 1905, it declined, and is today included in the city limits of Corpus Christi. To the north of the bay, the Coleman-Fulton Pasture Company controlled a large segment of San Patricio County for &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;ing during the aftermath of the Texas Revolution. &lt;a href=\"David%20Sinton\"&gt;David Sinton&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Phelps%20Taft\"&gt;Charles Phelps Taft&lt;/a&gt;, whose names are immortalized by the nearby towns of &lt;a href=\"Sinton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Sinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taft%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Taft&lt;/a&gt;, were involved with the company. They sold a plot of land on the northeast of Nueces Bay to &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20Paul\"&gt;George H. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, who hired Mexican immigrants to clear the land of &lt;a href=\"mesquite\"&gt;mesquite&lt;/a&gt; trees and founded a ranching community later named &lt;a href=\"West%20Portland%2C%20Texas\"&gt;West Portland&lt;/a&gt;. The plots of land in this community are still mostly held by the descendants of the original owners. The town of &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on the extreme northeast of the bay\u2014was also established from land purchased from the Coleman-Fulton Pasture Company by future State Senator &lt;a href=\"John%20G.%20Willacy\"&gt;John G. Willacy&lt;/a&gt; with help from a &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; company. The town steadily grew and reached a population of 14,827 by 2000. To the northwest of the bay, on the Whites Point peninsula, a settlement was established around 1866 by &lt;a href=\"Cattle%20drives%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;cattledriver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Rachal\"&gt;Darius Rachal&lt;/a&gt;, who had purchased land on the point from the cattle-driving White family. Soon after his purchase, many of the Whites died of &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; as an epidemic swept the area and killed 14 people. Rachal used his land to raise cattle, grow cotton, and sell real estate to new settlers. A post office was established at the site in 1892, and was given the name \"Rosita\" or \"little flower\" after the names \"White Point\" and \"Rachal\" were rejected by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;. After a 1915 gas explosion and two massive hurricanes, including a &lt;a href=\"1919%20Florida%20Keys%20hurricane\"&gt;1919 storm&lt;/a&gt; that killed 26 residents (about 50 were killed in Portland and 47 in Corpus Christi), the post office was closed in 1919, and by the next year, most residents had relocated to &lt;a href=\"Odem%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Odem&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nNueces Bay covers an area of and drains the of the Nueces River basin. It has an average depth of 2.3\u00a0ft, and a volume of . The bay is considered the southern extreme of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Coastal%20Plain\"&gt;Texas Coastal Plain&lt;/a&gt;, which stretches northeast to &lt;a href=\"Galveston%20Bay\"&gt;Galveston Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of the geographic transition from the grasslands of the coastal plain to the dry brush region of South Texas. It forms at the base of the Nueces River, which enters at the southwesternmost point of the bay. North of the Nueces entrance is the extension of Odem Bay, named for the nearby settlement of Odem. This extension includes shallow marsh fed by an extensive system of tidal streams including &lt;a href=\"Rincon%20Bayou\"&gt;Rincon Bayou&lt;/a&gt;, and is headed by Whites Point to the east. Due south of Whites Point at the mouth of Odem Bay, is an oil field, situated against the backdrop of heavy industry on the shore to the southwest. The southern shore, which continues toward Rincon Point, is slender due to the industrial canal &lt;a href=\"Dredging\"&gt;dredged&lt;/a&gt; to the south to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Corpus%20Christi\"&gt;Port of Corpus Christi&lt;/a&gt;. The mouth of Nueces Bay on Corpus Christi Bay from Rincon Point to Indian Point, is crossed by the mile-long (1.6\u00a0km) Nueces Bay Causeway, which leads to Portland. West Portland is found on the shoreline of the bay as it curves north and west, which is lined with &lt;a href=\"pier\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt;s and residences. The bay leads back west to Whites Point on the north shore, which is largely used for agriculture.\nEcosystem.\nThe Nueces estuary provides an ecosystem for a wide variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of &lt;a href=\"Choke%20Canyon%20Reservoir\"&gt;Choke Canyon Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt;, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Department\"&gt;Texas Parks and Wildlife Department&lt;/a&gt; and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. &lt;a href=\"Oyster\"&gt;Oyster&lt;/a&gt; beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20drum\"&gt;black drum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flounder\"&gt;flounder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"redfish\"&gt;redfish&lt;/a&gt;. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.\nA diverse collection of birds sustained by the water life, such as the &lt;a href=\"black%20skimmer\"&gt;black skimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brown%20pelican\"&gt;brown pelican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"great%20blue%20heron\"&gt;great blue heron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"laughing%20gull\"&gt;laughing gull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"roseate%20spoonbill\"&gt;roseate spoonbill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tern\"&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"white%20ibis\"&gt;white ibis&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as &lt;a href=\"bobcat\"&gt;bobcat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coyote\"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"feral%20hog\"&gt;feral hog&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20lion\"&gt;mountain lion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rattlesnake\"&gt;rattlesnake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20spiny%20lizard\"&gt;Texas spiny lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"western%20diamondback\"&gt;western diamondback&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndustry.\nOil has been pumped from the bay since 1912, but fishing has been a mainstay since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, &lt;a href=\"recreational%20fishing\"&gt;recreational fishing&lt;/a&gt; accounted for a yearly input of $17\u00a0million to the local economy, while &lt;a href=\"commercial%20fishing\"&gt;commercial fishermen&lt;/a&gt; contributed $27.3 million. Commercial &lt;a href=\"oyster%20farming\"&gt;oyster farming&lt;/a&gt; was common in the bay until 1995, when the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Department%20of%20State%20Health%20Services\"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; level of nearly 2500\u00a0mg/kg in oysters, which as &lt;a href=\"filter%20feeder\"&gt;filter feeder&lt;/a&gt;s, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc is believed to have been dumped into the bay by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Smelting%20and%20Refining%20Company\"&gt;American Smelting and Refining Company&lt;/a&gt;'s Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000\u00a0mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700\u00a0mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Commission%20on%20Environmental%20Quality\"&gt;Texas Commission on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt; has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"oil%20spill\"&gt;oil spill&lt;/a&gt;s have occurred as a result of the heavy &lt;a href=\"petroleum%20industry\"&gt;petroleum industry&lt;/a&gt; on the south shore of Nueces Bay. In 1984, about of oil leaked from a broken pipeline, which blackened of the shore. Ten years later, &lt;a href=\"Koch%20Industries\"&gt;Koch Industries&lt;/a&gt;, which owns a refinery on the bay, was responsible for a major spill that resulted in the release of of oil, leaving a slick that seeped into Corpus Christi Bay. The &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Protection%20Agency\"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; fined the company $30\u00a0million for the spill in 2000, and $2.5\u00a0million were later given by the company to the state of Texas to improve the bay's water quality."
