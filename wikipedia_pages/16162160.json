    "text": "The 6.57 Crew is an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20hooligan%20firms\"&gt;hooligan firm&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. The name, 6.57 Crew is taken from the time that the &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"London%20Waterloo%20station\"&gt;London Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; train left &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20and%20Southsea%20railway%20station\"&gt;Portsmouth and Southsea station&lt;/a&gt;. The firm were one of the most active firms in the 1980s and caused chaos wherever they went.\nBackground.\nOn March 4th 1987, following an away game against Derby County, the 6:57 crew fought against what was described in the local paper in the time as \"local black youths\" for four hours. The 6:57 crew was reported to have links with &lt;a href=\"Far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right political groups&lt;/a&gt;. Around that time, some 6:57 crew members would use the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20salute\"&gt;Nazi salute&lt;/a&gt; \"for a laugh\", and members of the 6:57 crew have acknowledged that they had \"right wing\" connections. \nOn 22 September 2001, the 6.57 Crew fought with &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Coventry City&lt;/a&gt; fans both at the match and in &lt;a href=\"Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; city centre. Before the match hooligans from both clubs clashed in the city centre. During the match, some Portsmouth hooligans ripped up seats and threw missiles at Coventry fans. After fighting broke out in the stand, &lt;a href=\"riot%20police\"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt; were called in and restored order. Following the match, further violence broke out in Coventry again. Ninety-three people were arrested for their involvement in riots involving over 300 people before and after a match with &lt;a href=\"Southern%20England\"&gt;South coast&lt;/a&gt; rivals &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton F.C.&lt;/a&gt; on 21 March 2004. The police were attacked, shops were looted, and cars were vandalised. Of those arrested, 64 were given banning orders, and some were jailed. One of the arrests included a ten-year-old boy who became the youngest-ever convicted football hooligan in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, when he was found guilty of violent disorder. In August that year, 54 Portsmouth hooligans were banned for life by club chairman &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Mandari%C4%87\"&gt;Milan Mandari\u0107&lt;/a&gt; for their involvement in the riots at the Southampton game.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 6.57 Crew were featured in an episode of the &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20%28UK%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Bravo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Bravo%20%28UK%20TV%20channel%29%23Current%20programming\"&gt;Britain's Toughest Towns&lt;/a&gt;,\" which focused on Portsmouth hooligans. They have also been the subject of three books, \"Rolling with the 6.57 Crew\", \"Playing Up with Pompey: The Story of the Portsmouth 6.57 Crew\" and \"6.57 The Story of Pompey's Hooligan Crew\".\nTravel ban.\nIn May 2006, 130 Portsmouth hooligans had to give up their &lt;a href=\"passport\"&gt;passport&lt;/a&gt;s so they could not travel to the &lt;a href=\"2006%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; because of their convictions for football-related crime.\nA &lt;a href=\"Home%20Office\"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; report in October 2007 listed all football banning orders by club. Statistics showed that Portsmouth had 95 banning orders in place against who are termed \"risk supporters\", the most in the Premier League. However, there had been just one banning order, the second lowest in the Premier League, between 10 October 2006 and the date of the report, 9 August 2007."
