    "text": "Nueve de Julio is a &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of Argentina, located in the south-center of the province of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Province%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt;. Lying within the &lt;a href=\"Tulum%20Valley\"&gt;Tulum Valley&lt;/a&gt; () agricultural oasis, almost 80% of the department's area is cultivated; it is known in particular for its production of wine and its fruit and vegetable crops.\nToponymy.\nThe department is named for its chief town, &lt;a href=\"Nueve%20de%20Julio%2C%20San%20Juan\"&gt;Nueve de Julio&lt;/a&gt;, which itself was named for the date of &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Argentina's declaration of independence&lt;/a&gt; on July 9, 1816.\nHistory.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area were the &lt;a href=\"Huarpe\"&gt;Huarpe&lt;/a&gt;s, who lived by agriculture, hunting, and fishing in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt;. The Spanish arrived in the area in 1562. The sparsely populated territory became part of the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Luc%C3%ADa%20Department\"&gt;Santa Luc\u00eda Department&lt;/a&gt; in 1869. As part of a reorganisation within the province in 1913, a municipality of Nueve de Julio was created, which took in the localities of Las Chacritas and Rinc\u00f3n Cercado. Then in 1928 some of the municipalities were abolished, including Nueve de Julio, which was incorporated in &lt;a href=\"Pocito%20Department\"&gt;Pocito Department&lt;/a&gt;. This step was reversed in 1942, when Nueve de Julio became one of the 19 departments of the province, within its present boundaries. Villa Nueve de Julio, Tierra Adentro, Las Majaditas and Las Chacritas are among the districts included within the department.\nFor religious purposes the department fell within the Santa Luc\u00eda parish until 1992, when &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Rosary\"&gt;Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as the department's own patron saint.\nGeography.\nThe Nueve de Julio Department is located in south central &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Province%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;San Juan Province&lt;/a&gt;, about east of the city of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt;. It has an area of . \nAdjacent departments are:\nNueve de Julio is one of the departments comprising the Tulum Valley, a space enclosed to the east by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Argentina%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt; and to the west by the Agua Negra creek. This valley forms a plain sloping gradually down to the east, comprising &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;oasis&lt;/a&gt; areas watered by rivers as well as desert areas which are more predominant in the south of the department. \nThe climate is &lt;a href=\"Continental%20climate\"&gt;continental&lt;/a&gt;, bringing very hot summers with temperatures up to 40 \u00b0C, and cold to moderate winters with sub-zero temperatures. Rainfall is scarce, and summer &lt;a href=\"hailstorm\"&gt;hailstorm&lt;/a&gt;s have an adverse effect on agriculture. Notable winds are the \"&lt;a href=\"zonda%20%28wind%29\"&gt;zonda&lt;/a&gt;\"a hot and dry wind from the westand a cold and damp south wind.\nThe flora is characterized by &lt;a href=\"xerophyte\"&gt;xerophytic&lt;/a&gt; vegetation, such as the \"jarilla\" bush and the \"retamos\", although the \"&lt;a href=\"totora%20%28plant%29\"&gt;totora&lt;/a&gt;\" and other types of &lt;a href=\"reed%20%28plant%29\"&gt;reed&lt;/a&gt; are also found. Bird life includes &lt;a href=\"herons\"&gt;herons&lt;/a&gt;, \"gallaretas\" and &lt;a href=\"moorhen\"&gt;moorhen&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"&lt;a href=\"coypu\"&gt;coypu&lt;/a&gt;\", an aquatic mammal, is found near the San Juan River. There are also many insects.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of this department is agricultural, with a cultivated area of 4,343 hectares, devoted mainly to &lt;a href=\"grapevine\"&gt;grapevine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"olive\"&gt;olive&lt;/a&gt; trees, &lt;a href=\"vegetables\"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; such as tomatoes and onions, fruit (melon, plum, quince), forestry, grains and forage crops. &lt;a href=\"Winemaking\"&gt;Winemaking&lt;/a&gt; is a leading industry, and one large factory produces vehicle parts and &lt;a href=\"polyethylene\"&gt;polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation.\nNueve de Julio is among the least populous of the departments in San Juan province, with only 9,307 inhabitants (2010 Census of Argentina). The majority are rural dwellers, and the urban minority are concentrated in the main town, also called Nueve de Julio; here many new dwellings have been built, some for use as holiday homes, but the town retains a rural atmosphere due to the various agricultural activities that are carried on. Las Chacritas, the second most populated locality, attracts residents by its proximity to a main route between &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt; city and &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe main localities are provided with electricity and drinking water. However, there has been only limited development of business premises. All levels of education, except for university, are available in Nueve de Julio.\nSeismic activity.\n&lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;s have occurred in areas adjacent to Nueve de Julio department, notably the &lt;a href=\"1944%20San%20Juan%20earthquake\"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1977%20San%20Juan%20earthquake\"&gt;1977 San Juan earthquake&lt;/a&gt;s."
