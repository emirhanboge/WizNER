He was elected to play in 3 &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCollege.\nPottios played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Notre%20Dame\"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Draft\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; in the second round of the &lt;a href=\"1961%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1961 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the Pittsburgh Steelers, also in the third round of the &lt;a href=\"1961%20American%20Football%20League%20Draft\"&gt;1961 AFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. He chose to play in Pittsburgh.\nNFL.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nPottios became the starting &lt;a href=\"middle%20linebacker\"&gt;middle linebacker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; from his rookie year, 1961, up to 1965. In his rookie year, he played in all 14 games, intercepting 2 passes and recovering 1 fumble for a defense that was 7th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed. He did not play in 1962. In 1963, he played in all 14 games, intercepting 4 passes for a defense that finished 8th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed, playing alongside rookie outside linebacker &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Russell%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Andy Russell&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964, he played in only 7 of 14 games, intercepting 1 pass and recovering 1 fumble for a defense that finished 9th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed. In 1965, he played in only 6 games, intercepting no pass and with no fumble recovery for a defense that finished 12th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed and a team that ended the season at 2-12.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nIn contrast, when Pottios joined the Rams from 1966 to 1970, with &lt;a href=\"George%20Allen%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; as head coach, they were above the .500 mark throughout the period and made the playoffs twice, in 1967 and 1969, with won-lost records of 11-1-2 and 11-3, respectively. Pottios was the starting &lt;a href=\"middle%20linebacker\"&gt;middle linebacker&lt;/a&gt; from 1967 to 1970, playing between &lt;a href=\"outside%20linebacker\"&gt;outside linebacker&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Pardee\"&gt;Jack Pardee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maxie%20Baughan\"&gt;Maxie Baughan&lt;/a&gt; throughout. In 1966, Pottios played in 12 games, but was the backup middle linebacker to the 37-year-old &lt;a href=\"Bill%20George%20%28American%20football%20player%29\"&gt;Bill George&lt;/a&gt; who played in all 14 games. In 1967, he played 11 of 14 games, intercepting 1 pass and recovering 1 fumble for the best defense in the league among 16 NFL teams in points allowed. That team lost to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; in the divisional round, in which Pottios started at middle linebacker. In 1968, he played all 14 games, recovering 4 fumbles for a defense that finished 3rd among 16 NFL teams in points allowed. But, in 1969, he played in only 5 of 14 games, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Woodlief\"&gt;Doug Woodlief&lt;/a&gt;. That team lost to the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt; in the divisional round with Woodlief as the starter. In 1970, his final year with the Rams, he regained his starting middle linebacker position, playing in all 14 games, with 2 interceptions and 2 fumbles recovered for a defense that finished 4th among 26 NFL teams in points allowed.\nWashington Redskins.\nPottios, along with &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Pardee\"&gt;Jack Pardee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maxie%20Baughan\"&gt;Maxie Baughan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diron%20Talbert\"&gt;Diron Talbert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilbur%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;John Wilbur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Jordan%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Jeff Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, followed head coach &lt;a href=\"George%20Allen%20%28American%20football%20coach%29\"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; to the Redskins which also acquired a &lt;a href=\"1971%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt; fifth-round pick (124th overall\u2013traded to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Boyd%20Dowler\"&gt;Boyd Dowler&lt;/a&gt;) from the Rams for &lt;a href=\"Marlin%20McKeever\"&gt;Marlin McKeever&lt;/a&gt;, first and third rounders in &lt;a href=\"1971%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt; (10th and 63rd overall\u2013&lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Robertson\"&gt;Isiah Robertson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Elmendorf\"&gt;Dave Elmendorf&lt;/a&gt; respectively) and third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounders in &lt;a href=\"1972%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; (73rd, 99th, 125th, 151st and 177th overall\u2013to &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, traded to &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Carollo%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Joe Carollo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Christiansen\"&gt;Bob Christiansen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Southern%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Texas Southern&lt;/a&gt; defensive tackle Eddie Herbert and to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; respectively) on January 28, 1971.\nPlaying up to 1973, his team reached the playoffs all three years, inserted between outside linebackers Pardee (1971\u201372) or &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Robinson%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Dave Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (1973) and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Hanburger\"&gt;Chris Hanburger&lt;/a&gt; (1971\u201373). In 1971, Pottios played in all 14 games and had one interception for a defense that finished 4th of 26 teams in the NFL in points allowed. That team lost a divisional round game to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%2049ers\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; in which Pottios started. In 1972, he played in only 7 games of 14 games, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Harold%20McLinton\"&gt;Harold McLinton&lt;/a&gt;, and recovered 1 fumble for a defense that finished 3rd of 26 teams in the NFL in points allowed. However, Pottios was the starting middle linebacker in all 3 playoff games the Redskins played that year, when they won a divisional round game against the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; and the NFC championship game against the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Staubach\"&gt;Roger Staubach&lt;/a&gt;-led Cowboys were limited to a miserable 169 yards of total offense and 3 points. However, Washington lost &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20VII\"&gt;Super Bowl VII&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; 14 to 7, in which they could not handle the running attack led by &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Csonka\"&gt;Larry Csonka&lt;/a&gt;. In 1973, his final year in the NFL, he played in only 6 of 14 games, but started a divisional round match against the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, losing his final game."
