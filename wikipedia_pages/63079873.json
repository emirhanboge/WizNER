    "text": "The Mid West Cup is a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Central West area of &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"Group%2010%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Group 10 Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently the second tier competition of Group 10. The premiers are awarded the Blayney Citizens' Cup, the oldest continuously award trophy in &lt;a href=\"Country%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Country Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;, with Neville the first recipients in 1913. It currently encompasses teams from &lt;a href=\"Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackheath%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Blackheath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kandos%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Kandos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithgow%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Lithgow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oberon%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Oberon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent teams.\nSeven teams will compete in the 2020 season, including former Group 10 side &lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon Tigers&lt;/a&gt;.

The first winner of the competition was Neville and the club awarded the Blayney Citizens' Cup, the oldest trophy still in regular use in &lt;a href=\"Country%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Country Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the competition was traditionally based in around the &lt;a href=\"Blayney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Blayney&lt;/a&gt; region, in the 1950s it expanded into &lt;a href=\"Rockley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Rockley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carcoar%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Carcoar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cullen%20Bullen%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Cullen Bullen&lt;/a&gt; before it was absorbed in the &lt;a href=\"Group%2010%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Group 10 Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; and renamed the Group 10 Second Division in 1970. It adopted its current name of the Mid West Cup in 1990. The competition only featured four teams in 2019, including CSU Mungoes, Lithgow Bears, Orange Barbarians and Portland Colts, but will expand to eight in 2020 with the inclusion of the reformed Blackheath Blackcats and Kandos Waratahs, &lt;a href=\"Oberon%20Tigers\"&gt;Oberon Tigers&lt;/a&gt; (who have been relegated from Group 10) and the newly-formed Orange United.\nMore than 40 teams have reportedly featured in the Mid West Cup over the course of its history.
