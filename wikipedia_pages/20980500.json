Choosing between \"Humans\" and \"Beasts\" factions, the player plays through twelve scenarios from each faction, gathering \"resources\", building fortresses, and managing troops to defeat the opposing force.\nMusic for \"Warlocked\" was composed by &lt;a href=\"Jeroen%20Tel\"&gt;Jeroen Tel&lt;/a&gt;. Critical reception towards the game was positive, with some critics calling it the best Real-time strategy game for the handheld. It received \"Best Game Boy Strategy\" by &lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Despite the accolades, sales were low. A sequel was planned for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; titled \"Wizards\" but was cancelled.\nGameplay.\n\"Warlocked\" is a &lt;a href=\"real-time%20strategy\"&gt;real-time strategy&lt;/a&gt; game. Split between two campaigns between the \"Humans\" and \"Beasts\" factions, the player goes through their campaign to defeat the enemy. There are 24 missions, 12 for both campaigns. Played in an overhead perspective, locations range from forests to tundras. A &lt;a href=\"fog%20of%20war\"&gt;fog of war&lt;/a&gt; covers the field, which can be revealed after sending out soldiers to their positions. Different soldiers such as &lt;a href=\"archers\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt; and wizards can be used for both factions. Wizards unique for each side range from giving opposing soldiers the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; or turning them to chickens. Multiplayer can be played between two people with &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Link%20Cable\"&gt;Game Link Cable&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\n\"Warlocked\" was developed by British company &lt;a href=\"Bits%20Studios\"&gt;Bits Studios&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;. The game was programmed by Steven Clark, with Martin Wheeler being the graphics artist and game designer. The music was composed by &lt;a href=\"Jeroen%20Tel\"&gt;Jeroen Tel&lt;/a&gt;. The game was showcased by Nintendo at the &lt;a href=\"Kimpton%20Sir%20Francis%20Drake%20Hotel\"&gt;Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel&lt;/a&gt; for games journalists to play. It was released on the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; exclusively in the United States July 24, 2000.\nReception.\nUpon release of the game, \"Warlocked\" received a score of 86% on review aggregation website \"&lt;a href=\"GameRankings\"&gt;GameRankings&lt;/a&gt;\". Critics made comparisons to the game with the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer\"&gt;Command &amp; Conquer&lt;/a&gt;\" franchises. Justin Whirledge for \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Radar\"&gt;Daily Radar&lt;/a&gt;\" called it the best real-time strategy games for the Game Boy Color. \"Nintendojo\"s Schuyler Lystad considered it the best game he ever played on the system, giving the game a perfect score. A reviewer for \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Power\"&gt;Nintendo Power&lt;/a&gt;\" thought it was a great introduction for people to the real-time strategy genre. \nAndy McNamara for \"&lt;a href=\"Game%20Informer\"&gt;Game Informer&lt;/a&gt;\", while criticizing the game for its slow movement, gave praise to its gameplay. &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Gerstmann\"&gt;Jeff Gerstmann&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"GameSpot\"&gt;GameSpot&lt;/a&gt;\" was less positive, criticizing its control scheme and the difficulty of selecting and deselecting units. Gerstmann also believed that the game would be too simple and too much like \"Warcraft\" for RTS fans to play for long. Despite this, he called the game \"pretty good\" and commended it for overcoming the limitations of being on the Game Boy Color. \"IGN\" named the game as the \"Best Game Boy Strategy\" game of 2000.\nRetrospective reviews were also positive. \"Digitally Downloaded\"s Matt Sainsbury gave praise towards its multiplayer. Joshua Jankiewicz at \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" considered it a feat from Bits Studios making a great Game Boy Color title. In 2009, IGN listed the game as one they would like to see on a hypothetical &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Console\"&gt;Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt; platform for the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DSi\"&gt;Nintendo DSi&lt;/a&gt;, owing partially due to its real-time strategy interface. While receiving positive reception, sales for the game were low. In spite of sales, Bits Studios attempted to make a sequel to the game, titled \"Wizards\". It was in development for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; and was to feature four-player multiplayer and gaming modes such as &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt;. Originally slated for release in 2002, it was cancelled due to the lack of a publisher."
