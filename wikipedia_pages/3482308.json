Rahman&lt;/a&gt; has described Sajjad as the original crossover:\n\"From the realm of the classical, he metamorphosed into one of the brightest lights of Pakistani pop. Always striking the right note, and never missing a beat, even the most hardened purist has to give Sajjad his due. This man can breathe life in a &lt;a href=\"Ghazal\"&gt;Ghazal&lt;/a&gt; even as he puts the V back into verve. He is one of the very few singers in Pakistan who seems a complete singer. As far as skill is concerned I feel nobody compares to Sajjad Ali. He is simply too good at everything he chooses to create.\"\nPersonal life.\nSajjad married his uncle's daughter Naureen in 1990. They have four children; two sons and two daughters. He lives in &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Marina\"&gt;Dubai Marina&lt;/a&gt;, United Arab Emirates with his family, where he has been based for many years.
