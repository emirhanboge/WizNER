    "text": "Lenard George Green (15 July 1931 \u2013 19 June 2021), better known as Leon Greene, was an English actor and singer.\nAt the age of 20, Greene joined the &lt;a href=\"D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;D'Oyly Carte Opera Company&lt;/a&gt; and sang bass with them for just over a year. After leaving the D'Oyly Carte, he appeared in bass roles for several productions between 1954 and 1963 with the &lt;a href=\"Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Opera\"&gt;Sadler's Wells Opera&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1963, he moved on to musical comedy, appearing in the &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt; production of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum\"&gt;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&lt;/a&gt;\" as the Roman captain &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Gloriosus\"&gt;Miles Gloriosus&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of that performance, he was asked to reprise the role for the film version of the show to begin his career in films.\nAmong operatic roles were, at Sadler's Wells, one of the three Vagabonds in \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Kluge\"&gt;Die Kluge&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1959, roles in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Nightingale%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;\" and Long Tom in \"&lt;a href=\"Merrie%20England%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Merrie England&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1960, Zuniga in \"&lt;a href=\"Carmen\"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1961, Private Willis in \"&lt;a href=\"Iolanthe\"&gt;Iolanthe&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1962 (also recorded), Alaska Wolf Joe in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Mahagonny\"&gt;The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1963, The Cook in \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20for%20Three%20Oranges\"&gt;Love for Three Oranges&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1963 (New Opera Company).

He reprised Miles Gloriosus in \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" at &lt;a href=\"Chichester%20Festival%20Theatre\"&gt;Chichester Festival Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1986, and the Baron for &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Opera\"&gt;Scottish Opera&lt;/a&gt; and in the award-winning production of \"&lt;a href=\"Candide%20%28operetta%29\"&gt;Candide&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Vic%20Theatre\"&gt;Old Vic&lt;/a&gt; in 1988-89.\nIn 1958 he was listed as the Publicity Manager of the London Opera Group, a professional touring opera company directed by Peter Glossop, also singing the title role in \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Pasquale\"&gt;Don Pasquale&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHis films included \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%20%28film%29\"&gt;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&lt;/a&gt;\" (1966), \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Challenge%20for%20Robin%20Hood\"&gt;A Challenge for Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;\" (1967), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Devil%20Rides%20Out%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/a&gt;\" (1968), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Squeeze%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;The Squeeze&lt;/a&gt;\" (1977), \"&lt;a href=\"Flash%20Gordon%20%28film%29\"&gt;Flash Gordon&lt;/a&gt;\" (1980), and several \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20films\"&gt;Carry On&lt;/a&gt;\" comedies.\nGreene died in June 2021 at the age of 89."
