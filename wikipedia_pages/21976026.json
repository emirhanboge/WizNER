    "text": "The Battle of T\u00e2rgu Frumos, also known as the T\u00e2rgu Frumos Operation, occurred during 1944 in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in and around the town of &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgu%20Frumos\"&gt;T\u00e2rgu Frumos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi%20County\"&gt;Ia\u015fi County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was fought between &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; forces (the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Axis%20powers\"&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt; forces (the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n forces) and, according to &lt;a href=\"David%20Glantz\"&gt;David Glantz&lt;/a&gt;, it was within a supposed Soviet Union &lt;a href=\"First%20Jassy-Kishinev%20Offensive\"&gt;First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. The same historian had earlier concluded that the battle was instead a successful example of Soviet \"&lt;a href=\"maskirovka\"&gt;maskirovka&lt;/a&gt;\", meant to trick the Germans into believing the region continued to be in their strategic interest after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Uman%E2%80%93Boto%C8%99ani%20Offensive\"&gt;Uman\u2013Boto\u0219ani Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term may apply to either to the entire scope of conflict in the area over a longer time, but often refers specifically to the battle in May. For example, a military unit or an individual can be said to have served in the battle.\nSoviet historians did not consider this to be a significant battle but have come around to identifying it separately.\nThe battle in May has been used in military education as an example of how a mobile defense can defeat an armoured spearhead."
