    "title": "French Penal Code of 1810",
    "text": "The Penal Code of 1810 was a code of criminal laws created under &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the &lt;a href=\"French%20Penal%20Code%20of%201791\"&gt;French Penal Code of 1791&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, this code reinstated a &lt;a href=\"life%20imprisonment\"&gt;life imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; punishment, as well as &lt;a href=\"Human%20branding\"&gt;branding&lt;/a&gt;. These had been abolished in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Penal%20Code%20of%201791\"&gt;French Penal Code of 1791&lt;/a&gt;. Issued on June 3, 1810, it stayed in use until March 1, 1994 when it was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Code%20p%C3%A9nal%20%28France%29\"&gt;Code p\u00e9nal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis code served as a basis for criminal laws in many of the countries occupied at the time by the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It was the fifth code promulgated by the Empire, and is not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Code\"&gt;Code Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, which was promulgated in 1804.\nHistory.\nThe initial move towards a new, cohesive French civil code was made in July 1800, when &lt;a href=\"First%20Consul\"&gt;First Consul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; appointed a four-man commission composed of Portalis, Tronchet, Bigot de Preamneneu, and Malleville to draft a project. Before the Napoleonic Code, France did not have a single set of &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;s; law consisted mainly of local customs, which had sometimes been officially compiled in \"custumals\" (\"&lt;a href=\"coutume\"&gt;coutume&lt;/a&gt;s\"), notably the \"&lt;a href=\"Custom%20of%20Paris%20in%20New%20France\"&gt;Custom of Paris&lt;/a&gt;\". There were also exemptions, &lt;a href=\"Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29\"&gt;privileges&lt;/a&gt;, and special charters granted by the kings or other feudal lords. During the Revolution, the last vestiges of &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudalism&lt;/a&gt; were abolished. Penal law in particular had been a source of great controversy during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which had promulgated the &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Code%20of%201791\"&gt;Penal Code of 1791&lt;/a&gt; and numerous &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;s. The new Penal Code was to replace various laws adopted during the first ten years of the Revolution, the backbone of which was the &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Code%20of%201791\"&gt;Penal Code of 1791&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Offences%20and%20Penalties\"&gt;Code of Offences and Penalties&lt;/a&gt; of 1795. An important feature of these two texts, which came after centuries of relentless severity, was to have fixed penalties to keep the role of judge strictly distributive, therefore eliminating the dangers of arbitrary sentencing. With the 1810 Penal Code, however, the sentences were given a set range, letting the judges decide more freely on the severity of the punishment.\nLike the 1791 Penal Code, the 1810 Penal Code did not include \"imaginary\" crimes such as &lt;a href=\"heresy\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homosexuality\"&gt;sodomy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, thereby legalising them by omission. However, &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; was made illegal, and it was harder for wives than husbands to file for &lt;a href=\"divorce\"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1810 Penal Code was revised twice in its life: once very importantly in 1832, the second, much more limited, in 1863. In 1974, the project for a new penal code began, but was not completed until 1994.\nContents.\nPresentation.\nThe 1810 Penal Code was divided into four books, with the third split into two parts:\nCrimes and Punishments.\nUnlike the 1791 Penal Code, which only tackled the most serious crimes, with lesser crimes being codified in the Code of Offences and Penalties, the 1810 Penal Code grouped together all crimes. Violations were punished by fine and, at most, five days in prison. &lt;a href=\"Misdemeanors\"&gt;Misdemeanors&lt;/a&gt; were punished by up to five years in prison and &lt;a href=\"Fine%20%28penalty%29\"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;. Penalties for felonies were to be either \"\" (afflictives and infaming) or merely \" (infaming)\", meaning the convicted lost some civil rights, such as the right to vote and to possess arms.\n&lt;a href=\"Felonies\"&gt;Felonies&lt;/a&gt; were to be punished by &lt;a href=\"death%20penalty\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hard%20labor\"&gt;hard labor&lt;/a&gt; for life or a term from five to twenty years or by reclusion from five to ten years.\nForfeiture of estate, lifelong &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"banishment\"&gt;banishment&lt;/a&gt; for a term between five and ten years were available for crimes against the state (which included &lt;a href=\"treason\"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"espionage\"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sedition\"&gt;sedition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"insurrection\"&gt;insurrection&lt;/a&gt;, and were severely punished, up to death with forfeiture of the convict's estate, or &lt;a href=\"Penal%20transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Aggravated%20murder\"&gt;Aggravated murder&lt;/a&gt;, this is to say, &lt;a href=\"Premeditation\"&gt;premeditated&lt;/a&gt;, committed during the commission of a crime or against &lt;a href=\"Parricide\"&gt;legitimate ascendants&lt;/a&gt; were to be punished by death, along with &lt;a href=\"kidnapping\"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; by torture, death threats or under the guise of a civil servants.\nIn addition, non-political felons could undergo supervision by the police.\nThe death sentence had to be carried out by &lt;a href=\"Decapitation\"&gt;beheading&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"guillotine\"&gt;guillotine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn popular culture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt;'s 1862 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables\"&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/a&gt;\", main character &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Valjean\"&gt;Jean Valjean&lt;/a&gt; is sentenced under the 1810 Penal Code to a sentence of hard labour for theft."
