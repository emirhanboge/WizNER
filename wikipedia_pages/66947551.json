    "text": "Tamarro (named after a mythological creature in local culture) is a genus of &lt;a href=\"Troodontidae\"&gt;troodontid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theropoda\"&gt;theropod&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Cretaceous\"&gt;Late Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tremp%20Formation\"&gt;Talarn Formation&lt;/a&gt; (Tremp Group) of &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The genus contains a single species, Tamarro insperatus, known from a partial &lt;a href=\"Metatarsal%20bones\"&gt;metatarsal&lt;/a&gt; described in 2021.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe holotype of \"Tamarro\", MCD-7073, a metatarsal, was found in 2003 at the Sant Rom\u00e0 d'Abella site, belonging to the Talarn Formation of the &lt;a href=\"Tremp%20Group\"&gt;Tremp Group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, Sell\u00e9s \"et al.\" described it as a new genus and species, \"Tamarro insperatus\"; the generic name is that of a small creature in the folklore of &lt;a href=\"Pallars\"&gt;Pallars&lt;/a&gt;, Spain, while the specific name means \"unexpected\", referring to the unexpected discovery of the fossil.\nClassification.\nSell\u00e9s \"et al.\" placed \"Tamarro\" in the &lt;a href=\"Jinfengopteryginae\"&gt;Jinfengopteryginae&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first member of the subfamily from Europe. They also suggested that its ancestors migrated from Asia to Europe sometime between the &lt;a href=\"Cenomanian\"&gt;Cenomanian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maastrichtian\"&gt;Maastrichtian&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaleobiology.\nAnalysis of the holotype suggests it was a subadult; its large size suggests it grew quickly early in its life.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Tamarro\" lived on the Ibero-Armorican Island, and its discovery increases knowledge about the diversity of small theropods on the Cretaceous European archipelago. It would have lived at the same time as dwarf sauropods and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs."
