    "text": "Nomex is a &lt;a href=\"flame%20retardant\"&gt;flame-resistant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"meta-%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"aramid\"&gt;aramid&lt;/a&gt; material developed in the early 1960s by &lt;a href=\"DuPont\"&gt;DuPont&lt;/a&gt; and first marketed in 1967.\nProperties.\nNomex and related aramid polymers are related to &lt;a href=\"nylon\"&gt;nylon&lt;/a&gt;, but have &lt;a href=\"aromaticity\"&gt;aromatic&lt;/a&gt; backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. Nomex is an example of a \"&lt;a href=\"meta-%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;\" variant of the &lt;a href=\"aramid\"&gt;aramid&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Kevlar\"&gt;Kevlar&lt;/a&gt; is a \"&lt;a href=\"para-%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;para&lt;/a&gt;\" aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex strands cannot align during filament &lt;a href=\"polymerization\"&gt;polymerization&lt;/a&gt; and have less strength: its &lt;a href=\"ultimate%20tensile%20strength\"&gt;ultimate tensile strength&lt;/a&gt; is 340 MPa. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material. It can withstand temperatures of up to 370\u00b0C.\nProduction.\nNomex is produced by &lt;a href=\"Condensation%20polymer\"&gt;condensation reaction&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"monomer\"&gt;monomer&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"m-phenylenediamine\"&gt;\"m\"-phenylenediamine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isophthalic%20acid\"&gt;isophthaloyl chloride&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is sold in both fiber and sheet forms and is used as a fabric where resistance from heat and flame is required. Nomex sheet is actually a &lt;a href=\"calender\"&gt;calendered paper&lt;/a&gt; and made in a similar fashion. Nomex Type 410 paper was the first Nomex paper developed and one of the higher volume grades made, mostly for &lt;a href=\"Insulator%20%28electrical%29\"&gt;electrical insulation&lt;/a&gt; purposes. Nomex fiber is made in the United States.\nWilfred Sweeny (1926\u20132011), the DuPont scientist responsible for discoveries leading to Nomex, earned a DuPont &lt;a href=\"Lavoisier%20Medal\"&gt;Lavoisier Medal&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 partly for this work.\nApplications.\nNomex Paper is used in electrical laminates such as circuit boards and transformer cores as well as fireproof &lt;a href=\"honeycomb%20structures\"&gt;honeycomb structures&lt;/a&gt; where it is saturated with a &lt;a href=\"phenolic%20resin\"&gt;phenolic resin&lt;/a&gt;. Honeycomb structures such as these, as well as &lt;a href=\"mylar\"&gt;mylar&lt;/a&gt;-Nomex laminates, are used extensively in aircraft construction. Firefighting, military aviation, and vehicle racing industries use Nomex to create clothing and equipment that can withstand intense heat.\nA Nomex hood is a common piece of racing and &lt;a href=\"fire%20fighting\"&gt;firefighting&lt;/a&gt; equipment. It is placed on the &lt;a href=\"human%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; on top of a &lt;a href=\"firefighter\"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"face\"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt; mask. The hood protects the portions of the head not covered by the &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; and face mask from the intense &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; of the fire.\nWildland firefighters wear Nomex shirts and trousers as part of their personal protective equipment during &lt;a href=\"wildfire%20suppression\"&gt;wildfire suppression&lt;/a&gt; activities.\n&lt;a href=\"Auto%20racing\"&gt;Racing car drivers&lt;/a&gt; wear &lt;a href=\"Racing%20suit\"&gt;driving suits&lt;/a&gt; constructed of Nomex and or other &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fire-retardant%20materials\"&gt;fire retardant materials&lt;/a&gt;, along with Nomex gloves, long underwear, &lt;a href=\"balaclava%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;balaclavas&lt;/a&gt;, socks, &lt;a href=\"racing%20helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; lining and shoes, to protect them in the event of a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Armed%20forces\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aviator\"&gt;pilots&lt;/a&gt; and aircrew wear &lt;a href=\"flight%20suit\"&gt;flight suit&lt;/a&gt;s made of over 92 percent Nomex to protect them from the possibility of &lt;a href=\"Cockpit%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;cockpit&lt;/a&gt; fires and other mishaps. Troops riding in ground vehicles often wear Nomex. Kevlar thread is often used to hold the fabric together at seams.\nMilitary tank drivers also typically use Nomex hoods as protection against fire.\nIn the U.S. space program, Nomex has been used for the &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Micrometeoroid%20Garment\"&gt;Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Extravehicular%20Mobility%20Unit\"&gt;Extravehicular Mobility Unit&lt;/a&gt; (in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Kevlar\"&gt;Kevlar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gore-Tex\"&gt;Gore-Tex&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Crew%20Escape%20Suit\"&gt;ACES&lt;/a&gt; pressure suit, both for fire and extreme environment (water immersion to near vacuum) protection, and as thermal blankets on the payload bay doors, fuselage, and upper wing surfaces of the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle\"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; Orbiter. It has also been used for the airbags for the &lt;a href=\"Mars%20Pathfinder\"&gt;Mars Pathfinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mars%20Exploration%20Rover\"&gt;Mars Exploration Rover&lt;/a&gt; missions , the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20spacecraft\"&gt;Galileo atmospheric probe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cassini-Huygens\"&gt;Cassini-Huygens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28moon%29\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; probe, as an external covering on the &lt;a href=\"AERCam%20Sprint\"&gt;AERCam Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, and is planned to be incorporated into NASA's upcoming &lt;a href=\"Crew%20Exploration%20Vehicle\"&gt;Crew Exploration Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nNomex has been used as an acoustic material in Troy, NY, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (&lt;a href=\"EMPAC\"&gt;EMPAC&lt;/a&gt;) main concert hall. A ceiling canopy of Nomex reflects high and mid frequency sound, providing reverberation, while letting lower frequency sound partially pass through the canopy. According to RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson, EMPAC is the first venue in the world to use Nomex as an architectural material for acoustic reasons.\nNomex (like Kevlar) is also used in the production of &lt;a href=\"loudspeaker\"&gt;loudspeaker&lt;/a&gt; drivers.\nHoneycomb-structured Nomex paper is used as a spacer between layers of lead in the &lt;a href=\"ATLAS%20experiment\"&gt;ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; Liquid Argon Calorimeter, and as a laminate core for hull and deck construction in custom boats such as Stiletto Catamarans like the &lt;a href=\"Stiletto%2027\"&gt;Stiletto 27&lt;/a&gt;.\nNomex is used in industrial applications as a filter in exhaust filtration systems, typically a &lt;a href=\"baghouse\"&gt;baghouse&lt;/a&gt;, that deal with hot gas emissions found in asphalt plants, cement plants, steel smelting facilities, and non-ferrous metal production facilities.\nNomex is used in some &lt;a href=\"classical%20guitar\"&gt;classical guitar&lt;/a&gt; soundboards in order to create a \"composite\" top. Nomex's rigidity and low density helps create a clear and loud sound when laminated between cedar and spruce 'skins'. While the 'laminated' technique was created by Matthias Dammann, the use of Nomex within was first employed by &lt;a href=\"luthier\"&gt;luthier&lt;/a&gt; Gernot Wagner.\nHistory.\nThe deaths in fiery crashes of race car drivers &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20Roberts\"&gt;Fireball Roberts&lt;/a&gt; at Charlotte, and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Sachs\"&gt;Eddie Sachs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20MacDonald\"&gt;Dave MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; at Indianapolis in 1964, led to the use of flame-resistant fabrics such as Nomex. In early 1966 \"Competition Press and Autoweek\" reported: \"During the past season, experimental driving suits were worn by &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Hansgen\"&gt;Walt Hansgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Masten%20Gregory\"&gt;Masten Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Panch\"&gt;Marvin Panch&lt;/a&gt; and Group 44's &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Tullius\"&gt;Bob Tullius&lt;/a&gt;; these four representing a fairly good cross section in the sport. The goal was to get use-test information on the comfort and laundering characteristics of Nomex. The Chrysler-Plymouth team at the recent Motor Trend 500 at &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20International%20Raceway\"&gt;Riverside&lt;/a&gt; also wore these suits.\""
