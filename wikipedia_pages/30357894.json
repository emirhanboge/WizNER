    "text": "Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji (died 1296) was an &lt;a href=\"imam\"&gt;imam&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zaidiyyah\"&gt;Zaidi&lt;/a&gt; state in &lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt; who held the imamate in 1261\u20131262.\nAt this time, most of Yemen was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Rasulid%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rasulid Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; which was &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and based in the lowland. In the northern parts of the highland, members of the Zaidi elite tried to maintain a position. One of them was Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji, a 16th-generation descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20Imams\"&gt;Twelver imam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20bin%20Ali\"&gt;Hasan bin Ali&lt;/a&gt; (d. 669). Yahya performed the &lt;a href=\"da%27wa\"&gt;da'wa&lt;/a&gt; (summoning for the imamate) in 1261. The majority of the population in &lt;a href=\"Hadur\"&gt;Hadur&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding districts acknowledged him. However, the Rasulids were on the alert and sent the redoubtable &lt;a href=\"emir\"&gt;emir&lt;/a&gt; Alam ad-Din Sinjar al-Sha'bi with a force, \"springing upon him like a cat.\" The Zaidis were unable to withstand the incursion and Yahya's followers scattered to distant places. Alam ad-Din then returned to &lt;a href=\"San%27a\"&gt;San'a&lt;/a&gt;. Imam Yahya traveled to the land of Banu Fahim; however, the locals took him in custody and turned him over to Alam ad-Din. The emir blinded him in October 1262. His reign as imam is sometimes counted until 1271, though there seem to be no records of his activities in the intervening years. His death is recorded in 1296."
