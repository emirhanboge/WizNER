    "text": "The A244-s is an Italian lightweight, fire-and-forget &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; employed for &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20warfare\"&gt;anti-submarine warfare&lt;/a&gt;. It can be launched from surface vessels or from aircraft, and locates the target by means of an acoustic seeker.\nDescription.\nThe torpedo uses a CIACIO-S seeker, consisting of an acoustic homing head containing the transducer assembly, transmitter and related &lt;a href=\"Beamforming\"&gt;Beamforming&lt;/a&gt; circuits, and a frame housing all the remaining electronic components. The homing head is capable of active, passive or mixed modes for closing onto its target. It can also discriminate between decoys and real targets in the presence of heavy reverberations by specially emitted pulses and signal processing.\nThe latest version is the A244-S mod.3 torpedo.\nThe A244/s are developed and manufactured by the Italian (Whitehead Alenia Sistemi Subacquei) firm."
