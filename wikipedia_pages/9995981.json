    "text": "Clarence John McLeod (July 3, 1895 \u2013 May 15, 1959) was a politician from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; who served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcLeod was born in &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, the son of a well-to-do &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; father who had served as Collector of Internal Revenue in Detroit. He attended the public schools and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Detroit\"&gt;University of Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated with an &lt;a href=\"LL.B.\"&gt;LL.B.&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20College%20of%20Law\"&gt;Detroit College of Law&lt;/a&gt; in 1918. He was a member of &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Theta%20Phi\"&gt;Delta Theta Phi&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary service.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, McLeod served as a &lt;a href=\"Private%20%28rank%29\"&gt;private&lt;/a&gt; in the aviation section at the ground school, &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ithaca%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ithaca, New York&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href=\"sergeant\"&gt;sergeant&lt;/a&gt; in the Intelligence Division. He accepted appointment on May 12, 1919, as &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the Officers\u2019 Reserve Corps, and successively as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;. He was admitted to the bar in 1919 and commenced the practice of law in Detroit.\nPolitical career.\nIn November 1920, McLeod was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Michigan%27s%2013th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Michigan's 13th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"66th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;66th United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; to fill the vacancy caused by the death of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Archibald%20Nichols\"&gt;Charles A. Nichols&lt;/a&gt;. McLeod served from November 2, 1920, to March 3, 1921. At the time, McLeod was the youngest person ever elected to Congress, being just five months over the age of 25\u2014the minimum age required by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, McLeod was a candidate only to fill the unexpired term of Nichols. At that same election, &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20M.%20Brennan\"&gt;Vincent M. Brennan&lt;/a&gt; was simultaneously elected to a full term in the &lt;a href=\"67th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;67th Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1922, however, McLeod was elected to the &lt;a href=\"68th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;68th Congress&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently re-elected to the six succeeding Congresses, serving in the House of Representatives without interruption from March 4, 1923, to January 3, 1937. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary election for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;Governor of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in 1934. In 1936, he lost to &lt;a href=\"Democrat%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20D.%20O%27Brien\"&gt;George O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; in the general election for the &lt;a href=\"75th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;75th Congress&lt;/a&gt;. In 1937, McLeod was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for &lt;a href=\"mayor%20of%20Detroit\"&gt;mayor of Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1938, McLeod defeated O'Brien to be elected to the &lt;a href=\"76th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;76th Congress&lt;/a&gt;, serving from January 3, 1939, to January 3, 1941. McLeod lost to O'Brien in 1940, 1942, and 1944. In 1946, McLeod was defeated for the Republican nomination by &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Aldridge%20Coffin\"&gt;Howard Aldridge Coffin&lt;/a&gt;, who then went on to defeat O'Brien in the general election. McLeod won the Republican nomination in 1950 and 1952, but lost both times to O'Brien in the general election.\nLater life.\nAfter leaving Congress, McLeod returned to the practice of law and was a consultant to the Administrator of &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Civil%20Defense%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Civil Defense Administration&lt;/a&gt;. He died in Detroit in 1959 and was interred in the city's &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olivet%20Cemetery%20%28Detroit%29\"&gt;Mount Olivet Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;."
