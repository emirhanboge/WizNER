    "text": "The Apulian regional election of 2005 took place on 3\u20134 April 2005.\n&lt;a href=\"Nichi%20Vendola\"&gt;Nichi Vendola&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Communist%20Refoundation%20Party\"&gt;Communist Refoundation Party&lt;/a&gt;) defeated incumbent &lt;a href=\"Raffaele%20Fitto\"&gt;Raffaele Fitto&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia\"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt;). The success of Vendola came somewhat unexpected. In a &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Italy\"&gt;Southern Italian&lt;/a&gt; Region, expected to be morally conservative, Vendola, a &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homosexuality\"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt;, defeated Fitto, a conservative &lt;a href=\"Christian%20democracy\"&gt;Christian democrat&lt;/a&gt;. Vendola was the first candidate ever to be appointed by its coalition through a &lt;a href=\"primary%20election\"&gt;primary election&lt;/a&gt; instead of agreements between parties. A defeat of Vendola might have resulted in a cancellation of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29%23Primary%20elections\"&gt;primary election of The Union&lt;/a&gt; for choosing the candidate for Prime Minister in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Italian%20general%20election\"&gt;2006 general election&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentre-left primary election.\nThe centre-left candidate was chosen through primary elections, which were won by surprise by Nichi Vendola."
