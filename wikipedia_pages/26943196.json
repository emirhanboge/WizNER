    "text": "Harry Bradshaw (17 April 1868 \u2013 31 December 1910) was an English &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;, and professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1890s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and at club level for &lt;a href=\"Bramley%20RLFC\"&gt;Bramley&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Front%20row\"&gt;front row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Locks\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Back%20row\"&gt;back row&lt;/a&gt;, and club level rugby league (RL) for &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested &lt;a href=\"Scrum%20%28rugby%29%23Rugby%20league\"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt;s. Prior to Tuesday 2 June 1896, Bramley was a rugby union club.\nBackground.\nHarry Bradshaw was born in &lt;a href=\"Bramley%2C%20Leeds\"&gt;Bramley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, England, he died aged 42 in &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, England.\nPlaying career.\nInternational honours.\nHarry Bradshaw won &lt;a href=\"Cap%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cap&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; (RU) while at Bramley in 1892 against Scotland, in 1893 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and in 1894 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.\nIn the early years of rugby football the \"goal\" was to score goals, and a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to \"try\" at goal, and \"&lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt;\" the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \"score\" a try, without scoring any points.\nChange of Code.\nWhen Bramley converted from the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; code to the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; code on Tuesday 2 June 1896, Harry Bradshaw would have been 28 years of age. Consequently, he was both a rugby union and rugby league footballer.\nContemporaneous Quote.\nThe first game of the &lt;a href=\"1894%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1894 Home Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; for Wales was against England, and they suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24-3. In an after match interview Wales' winger &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Biggs\"&gt;Norman Biggs&lt;/a&gt; was asked why he had failed to tackle England's forward Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded \"Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!\".\nNote.\nESPN states Harry Bradshaw's date of birth as being 17 April 1868, and date of death as being 31 December 1910, making him 42 at the time of his death. Whereas FreeBMD quotes Harry Bradshaw's age at death as being 41."
