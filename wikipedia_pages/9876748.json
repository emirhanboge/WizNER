    "text": "The Bank of the Republic () is the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially established under the &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28Colombia%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt; era in 1880. Its main modern functions, under the new &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Constitution%20of%201991\"&gt;Colombian constitution&lt;/a&gt; were detailed by &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070626191717/http%3A//www.banrep.gov.co/documentos/el-banco/pdf/l31de1992.pdf\"&gt;Ley 31 de 1992&lt;/a&gt;. One of them is the issuance of the Colombian currency, the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20peso\"&gt;peso&lt;/a&gt;. The bank is also active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.afi-global.org/\"&gt;Alliance for Financial Inclusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThere are at least three predecessors to the current bank. The first &lt;a href=\"national%20bank\"&gt;national bank&lt;/a&gt; was created in 1880, named the \"Banco Nacional\", and its functions included handling the state funds, issuing currency and making loans to the state. In 1894 the Congress closed the bank due to registered excesses in the issuance of currency and bonds. In 1905 the president &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Reyes\"&gt;Rafael Reyes&lt;/a&gt; created the \"Banco Central de Colombia\" but it was closed in 1910 \nby Reyes opponents.\nIn 1923, after several years of financial crisis, President &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Nel%20Ospina\"&gt;Pedro Nel Ospina&lt;/a&gt; requested an expert committee to study Colombian economic conditions. This committee, led by American economist &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Walter%20Kemmerer\"&gt;Edwin Walter Kemmerer&lt;/a&gt; (known as \"The Money Doctor\") was called the \"Mission Kemmerer\". Kemmerer had already worked with Latin American governments: that of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 1917 and of &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. He helped the Colombian government create the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica and the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20the%20Comptroller%20General%20of%20the%20Republic\"&gt;Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and to structure the laws for this function using those already existing. After his work in Colombia, Kemmerer did the same for other Latin American governments, like &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; in 1925, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 and &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; in 1931.\nThe bank was officially chartered by the Law 25 of July 25, 1923, 5 days after the 113 anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Colombia%23Spanish%20annexation\"&gt;Independence of Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. With an initial capital of 10 million dollars in gold, half provided by the government and the rest by foreign and national commercial banks. Its role as a \"banker for banks\" includes:\nThe Board of Directors was created by the same law, with ten members from private and public sectors of the economy with the power to enforce regulatory and monetary controls. The Board was also given the responsibility of establishing the &lt;a href=\"discount%20window\"&gt;discount rate&lt;/a&gt; and intervening to control &lt;a href=\"interest%20rates\"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilding.\nThe headquarters of the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica are located in &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, in the historical center of the city (Calle 11 No. 4-21) and a few blocks away from the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Museum%2C%20Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Gold Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luis%20%C3%81ngel%20Arango%20Library\"&gt;Luis \u00c1ngel Arango Library&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the \"Fiscal\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n de Colombia\" bunker, it is one of the most secure buildings in the country, with several security levels required to access different areas. The security is handled by private companies and the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20National%20Police\"&gt;Colombian National Police&lt;/a&gt;, armed with Colombian-made &lt;a href=\"MAC-10\"&gt;MAC-10&lt;/a&gt; sub-machine guns, among others. Most of the administrative areas of the bank are located above ground, in a twelve-story building. Below the street there is a heavily guarded area where money in different currencies is stored, and in a special vault the country's reserve of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultural administration.\nBeside their primary roles in the Colombian economy, the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica runs an extensive culture-preservation and dissemination program. It runs two important institutions in Colombian culture: the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Museum%2C%20Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Gold Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Bogot\u00e1 and the &lt;a href=\"Luis%20%C3%81ngel%20Arango%20Library\"&gt;Luis \u00c1ngel Arango Library&lt;/a&gt;, but in addition, it runs other five Gold Museums (Armenia, &lt;a href=\"Calima%20Gold%20Museum\"&gt;Cali&lt;/a&gt;, Cartagena, Pasto, and Santa Marta); the Leticia Ethnographic Museum; the G\u00f3mez Campuzano House in Bogot\u00e1; a 28-city Library Network; a Concert Hall in the Arango Library; and three museums in Bogot\u00e1, namely, the Mint Museum (Casa de la Moneda), the &lt;a href=\"Botero%20Museum\"&gt;Botero Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the MAMU (Museo de Arte Miguel Urrutia).\nAlso, the Bank has two scholarship programs for the best researchers in Economics (Lauchlin Currie Scholarship) and in Economic Law (Enrique Low Murtra Scholarship).\nBanrepcultural.\nThe online presence of all the museum sites, plus an encyclopaedia, plus an online library, is called \"Banrepcultural\", a &lt;a href=\"portmanteau\"&gt;portmanteau&lt;/a&gt; for \"Red Cultural del Banco de la Rep\u00fablica en Colombia\". It calls itself \"the oldest virtual library in Latin America\", and uses the domain banrepcultural.org."
