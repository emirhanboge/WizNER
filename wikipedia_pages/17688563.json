    "text": "The historic Savannah \u2013 Ogeechee Barge Canal is one of the prime relics in the history of southern &lt;a href=\"canals\"&gt;canals&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning with the tidal lock at the &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20River\"&gt;Savannah River&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"waterway\"&gt;waterway&lt;/a&gt; continues through four &lt;a href=\"Boat%20lift\"&gt;lift locks&lt;/a&gt; as it traverses , before reaching another &lt;a href=\"tidal%20lock\"&gt;tidal lock&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ogeechee%20River\"&gt;Ogeechee River&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Stewart\"&gt;Fort Stewart&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, the canal passed through &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s 19th century &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20sector\"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; corridor, former &lt;a href=\"rice%20fields\"&gt;rice fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"timber\"&gt;timber&lt;/a&gt; tracts, and a still lush tidal river &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; and adjacent &lt;a href=\"sandhill\"&gt;sandhill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Environment%20%28biophysical%29\"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; that is the characteristic habitat for several unique species of &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. Nowadays much of this area comprises the Savannah suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Garden%20City%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Garden City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pooler%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Pooler&lt;/a&gt;. The canal was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on August 11, 1997.\n1825 - 1890s.\nThe Savannah - Ogeechee Canal was an important and profitable enterprise during the mid-nineteenth century. Originally chartered in 1824, the 's of canal was completed in December 1830. Numerous problems (such as decay of wooden locks and repeated erosion of &lt;a href=\"Levee\"&gt;embankments&lt;/a&gt;) plagued the canal during its early days of operation. The parent company declared bankruptcy in 1836. A new company was formed that widened and improved existing structures within the canal. From the 1840s to the 1860s, the canal generally prospered and became an important element in the south &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"economy\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe canal opened to transport in 1831 and became an important partner in the economy of south Georgia. Its impact on the &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; trade was particularly important with one of the nation's largest &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt;s located along the canal's &lt;a href=\"Canal%20basin\"&gt;basin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cotton\"&gt;Cotton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guano\"&gt;guano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"naval%20stores\"&gt;naval stores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peach\"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;es, and other goods also traversed the canal. Later in the century, the canal suffered a gradual decline. Heavy June &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;s seriously damaged the canal embankments in 1876 coupled with a &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"epidemic\"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; which fatally inflicted over 1,000 individuals. The canal had become more a &lt;a href=\"public%20health\"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; nuisance than an economic asset. By the early 1890s, the canal ceased to operate as a transportation corridor as the &lt;a href=\"Central%20of%20Georgia%20Railway\"&gt;Central of Georgia Railway&lt;/a&gt; brought various &lt;a href=\"wharves\"&gt;wharves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warehouses\"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt;, and canal frontage properties.\nToday.\nNow a century after the canal ceased commercial operations, local citizens have started to restore and interpret the &lt;a href=\"waterway\"&gt;waterway&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"natural%20environment\"&gt;natural environment&lt;/a&gt;. In cooperation with &lt;a href=\"Chatham%20County%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Chatham County&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.chathamnc.org/index.aspx\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Department of Parks, &lt;a href=\"Recreation\"&gt;Recreation&lt;/a&gt;, and Cultural Affairs, the Savannah \u2013 Ogeechee Canal Society is working to turn the canal into a multipurpose linear park.\nA walk along the Heel or Tow paths provides a delightful and attractive setting to enjoy this unique waterway.\nSavannah-Ogeechee Canal Museum &amp; Nature Center.\nCurrently most of the effort is expended at the &lt;a href=\"Ogeechee%20River\"&gt;Ogeechee River&lt;/a&gt; terminus near Lock 5 where the Savannah\u2013Ogeechee Canal Museum &amp; Nature Center at 681 Fort Argyle Rd, Savannah, is open. Exhibits highlight the canal's history and the natural history of the local area. The museum also offers guided history and natural history tours of the area."
