    "text": "Canopus (, ; , ), also known as Canobus (, ), was an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian coastal town, located in the &lt;a href=\"Nile%20Delta\"&gt;Nile Delta&lt;/a&gt;. Its site is in the eastern outskirts of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, around from the center of that city. Canopus was located on the western bank at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the Delta \u2013 known as the Canopic or Heracleotic branch. It belonged to the seventh Egyptian &lt;a href=\"Nome%20%28Egypt%29\"&gt;Nome&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"Menelaites\", and later as \"Canopites\", after it. It was the principal port in Egypt for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria, along with &lt;a href=\"Naucratis\"&gt;Naucratis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heracleion\"&gt;Heracleion&lt;/a&gt;. Its ruins lie near the present Egyptian town of &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Qir\"&gt;Abu Qir&lt;/a&gt;.\nLand in the area of Canopus was subject to rising sea levels, earthquakes, tsunamis, and large parts of it seem to have succumbed to liquefaction sometime at the end of the 2nd century BC. The eastern suburbs of Canopus collapsed, their remains being today submerged in the sea, with the western suburbs being buried beneath the modern coastal city of &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Qir\"&gt;Abu Qir&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nThe settlement's &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20language\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; name was written in &lt;a href=\"Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29\"&gt;Demotic&lt;/a&gt; as (, sometimes romanized Peguat or Pikuat). The Greeks called it Canopus (, \"K\u00e1n\u014dpos\") after a &lt;a href=\"Canopus%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;legendary commander&lt;/a&gt; of the era of the &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20War\"&gt;Trojan War&lt;/a&gt; supposedly buried there. The English form of the name derives from the &lt;a href=\"Latinization%20of%20names\"&gt;Latinized&lt;/a&gt; form used under &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Roman rule&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient Egypt.\nCanopus was the site of a temple to the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20pantheon\"&gt;Egyptian god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Serapis\"&gt;Serapis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name of Canopus appears in the first half of the 6th century BC in a poem by &lt;a href=\"Solon\"&gt;Solon&lt;/a&gt;. Early &lt;a href=\"Egyptology\"&gt;Egyptological&lt;/a&gt; excavations some 2 or 3\u00a0km from the area known today as &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Qir\"&gt;Abu Qir&lt;/a&gt; have revealed extensive traces of the city with its quays, and granite monuments with the name of &lt;a href=\"Ramesses%20II\"&gt;Ramesses II&lt;/a&gt;, but they may have been brought in for the adornment of the place at a later date. The exact date of the foundation of Canopus is unknown, but &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt; refers to it as an ancient port. Homeric myth claims that it was founded by &lt;a href=\"Menelaus\"&gt;Menelaus&lt;/a&gt;, and named after &lt;a href=\"Canopus%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Canopus&lt;/a&gt;, the pilot of his ship, who died there after being bitten by a serpent. Legend describes how Menelaus built a monument to his memory on the shore, around which the town later grew up. There is unlikely to be any connection with \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Acanopy\"&gt;canopy&lt;/a&gt;\". A temple to &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; was built by king &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%20III%20Euergetes\"&gt;Ptolemy III Euergetes&lt;/a&gt;, but according to Herodotus, very near to Canopus was an older shrine, a temple of &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt; that served as an asylum for fugitive slaves. Osiris was worshipped at Canopus under a peculiar form: that of a vase with a human head. Through an old misunderstanding, the name \"&lt;a href=\"canopic%20jar\"&gt;canopic jar&lt;/a&gt;s\" was applied by early &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Egyptologists\"&gt;Egyptologists&lt;/a&gt; to the vases with human and animal heads in which the internal organs were placed by the Egyptians after embalming.\nHellenistic period.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%20III%20Euergetes\"&gt;Ptolemy III Euergetes&lt;/a&gt;' ninth regnal year (239 BC), a great assembly of priests at Canopus passed an honorific decree (the \"&lt;a href=\"Decree%20of%20Canopus\"&gt;Decree of Canopus&lt;/a&gt;\") that, \"inter alia,\" conferred various new titles on the king and his consort, &lt;a href=\"Berenice%20II%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Berenice&lt;/a&gt;. Three examples of this decree are now known (plus some fragments), inscribed in &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20language\"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; (in both &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20hieroglyphs\"&gt;hieroglyphic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demotic%20%28Egyptian%29\"&gt;demotic&lt;/a&gt;) and in classical &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, and they were second only to the more famous &lt;a href=\"Rosetta%20Stone\"&gt;Rosetta Stone&lt;/a&gt; in providing the key to deciphering the ancient Egyptian language. This was the earliest of the series of &lt;a href=\"bilingual\"&gt;bilingual&lt;/a&gt; inscriptions of the \"Rosetta Stone Series\", also known as the &lt;a href=\"Ptolemaic%20Decrees\"&gt;Ptolemaic Decrees&lt;/a&gt;. There are three such Decrees altogether.\nThe town had a large trade in &lt;a href=\"henna\"&gt;henna&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoman period.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Roman times&lt;/a&gt;, the town was notorious for its dissoluteness. &lt;a href=\"Seneca%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt; wrote of the luxury and vice of Canopus, though he also mentioned that \"Canopus does not keep any man from living simply\". &lt;a href=\"Juvenal\"&gt;Juvenal&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Satire%20VI\"&gt;Satire VI&lt;/a&gt;\" referred to the \"debauchery\" that prevailed there. The emperor &lt;a href=\"Hadrian\"&gt;Hadrian&lt;/a&gt; built a &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tivoli%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Tivoli&lt;/a&gt;, 18 miles away from Rome, where he replicated for his enjoyment architectural patterns from all parts of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. One of these (and the most excavated and studied today) was borrowed from Canopus.\nModern town.\nThe Egyptian town of &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Qir\"&gt;Abu Qir&lt;/a&gt; (\"Father Cyrus\"), honoring two Christian martyrs, is located a few kilometres away from the ruins of Canopus. It is a town (around 1900 with 1000 inhabitants), at the end of a little peninsula north-east of Alexandria. It has a trade in &lt;a href=\"quail\"&gt;quail&lt;/a&gt;s, which are caught in nets hung along the shore. Off Aboukir on 1 August 1798, the French Mediterranean fleet was destroyed within the roads by British Admiral &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Horatio Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 July 1799, &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; destroyed there a Turkish army 18,000 strong; and on 8 March 1801, the French garrison of 1,800 men was defeated by 20,000 English and Ottoman Turks commanded by Abercromby.\nSee of Canopus.\nEgypt had many martyrs in the persecution of &lt;a href=\"Diocletian\"&gt;Diocletian&lt;/a&gt;, among others St. &lt;a href=\"Athanasia\"&gt;Athanasia&lt;/a&gt; with her three daughters, and St. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20and%20John\"&gt;Cyrus and John&lt;/a&gt;. There was here a monastery called Metanoia, founded by monks from &lt;a href=\"Tabennisi\"&gt;Tabennisi&lt;/a&gt;, where many a &lt;a href=\"patriarch%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;patriarch of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; took shelter during the religious quarrels of the 5th century. east of Canopus was the famous Pharaonic temple of Manouthin, afterwards destroyed by monks, and a church on the same spot dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Evangelists\"&gt;Four Evangelists&lt;/a&gt;. St. &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20of%20Alexandria\"&gt;Cyril of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; solemnly transported the relics of the holy martyrs Cyrus and John into the church, which became an important place of &lt;a href=\"pilgrimage\"&gt;pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that St. &lt;a href=\"Sophronius%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Sophronius of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; was healed of an &lt;a href=\"ophthalmy\"&gt;ophthalmy&lt;/a&gt; that had been declared incurable by the physicians (610\u2013619), whereupon he wrote the &lt;a href=\"panegyric\"&gt;panegyric&lt;/a&gt; of the two saints with a compilation of seventy miracles worked in their sanctuary (&lt;a href=\"Migne\"&gt;Migne&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Patrologia%20Graeca\"&gt;Patrologia Graeca&lt;/a&gt;\", LXXXVII, 3379-676) Canopus formed, with Menelaus and Schedia, a &lt;a href=\"suffragan\"&gt;suffragan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20see\"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; subject to Alexandria in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20province\"&gt;Roman province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Aegyptus Prima&lt;/a&gt;; it is usually called Schedia in the \"&lt;a href=\"Notitiae%20episcopatuum\"&gt;Notitiae episcopatuum&lt;/a&gt;\". Two &lt;a href=\"titular%20see\"&gt;titulars&lt;/a&gt; are mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Lequien\"&gt;Lequien&lt;/a&gt; (II, 415), one in 325, the other in 362.\nArchaeology.\nOver time the land around Canopus was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and rising sea levels. Finds of pottery and coins appear to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. At this point, probably after a severe flood, the eastern suburbs succumbed to liquefaction of the soil on which it was built. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed. The western suburbs eventually became the present day Egyptian coastal city of Abu Qir.\nIn 1933 ruins were sighted under the water by an &lt;a href=\"RAF\"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; commander who was flying over Abu Qir Bay. Egyptian scholar &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Omar%20Toussoun\"&gt;Prince Omar Toussoun&lt;/a&gt; subsequently undertook archaeological investigations between 1934 and 1940. The undersea ruins were eventually identified as the lost cities of Heracleion and Canopus.\nIn 2000 the French &lt;a href=\"underwater%20archaeology\"&gt;underwater archaeologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franck%20Goddio\"&gt;Franck Goddio&lt;/a&gt; explored the submerged ruins of the two cities. Archaeological discoveries made by Goddio's team included parts of the \"&lt;a href=\"Saft%20el-Hinna%23Excavations\"&gt;Naos of the Decades&lt;/a&gt;\" temple and pieces of various statues, including a marble head of the god &lt;a href=\"Serapis\"&gt;Serapis&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nAttribution:"
