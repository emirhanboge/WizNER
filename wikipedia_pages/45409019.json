    "title": "Murder of \u00d6zgecan Aslan",
    "text": "\u00d6zgecan Aslan (22 October 1995 \u2013 11 February 2015) was a &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; university student who was murdered while resisting attempted rape on 11 February 2015 on a &lt;a href=\"minibus\"&gt;minibus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mersin\"&gt;Mersin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Her burnt body was discovered on 13 February. The murder was committed by minibus driver Ahmet Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken, and his father Necmettin Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken and friend Fatih G\u00f6k\u00e7e were accomplices in covering up the murder. All perpetrators were handed aggravated &lt;a href=\"life%20sentence\"&gt;life sentence&lt;/a&gt;s without the possibility of &lt;a href=\"parole\"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe murder caused nationwide outrage and sparked protests across the country on the following days. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in several provinces, with some criticizing the government for its \"insufficient response\" and alleged normalization of the rape of non-conservative women. The protests were described as the first mass movement for Turkish women. It also provoked calls for reforms to combat &lt;a href=\"violence%20against%20women\"&gt;violence against women&lt;/a&gt; more effectively. The case received great attention on social media and prompted women to share their experiences of harassment, with 16 February being dubbed as \"Black Monday\" due to protests. The murder was described as a catalyst for women to speak out about their long-withheld suffering, but \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" expected also a rift between women who defend silence and patriarchal status quo and those refusing to keep quiet.\nBackground.\n\u00d6zgecan was born into a poor &lt;a href=\"Alevi\"&gt;Alevi&lt;/a&gt; Turkish family, who traced their origins to &lt;a href=\"Tunceli\"&gt;Tunceli&lt;/a&gt;. She was a first-year &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; student in the &lt;a href=\"%C3%87a%C4%9F%20University\"&gt;\u00c7a\u011f University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tarsus%2C%20Mersin\"&gt;Tarsus&lt;/a&gt;. She was born and raised in Mersin, and wanted to study psychology, for which she had developed a strong passion while she was studying at the tourism high school. Her parents were supportive of her, with her mother returning to the workforce in order to fund her education, to augment the 50% scholarship she had earned. Her father is a graphic designer, but he lacked a permanent job at the time of the murder, while her mother had previously retired from a &lt;a href=\"cargo\"&gt;cargo&lt;/a&gt; company. She was also planning to work at a hotel in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Cyprus\"&gt;Northern Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; during the summer to help with her fees. She had an elder sister who was studying opera and singing in &lt;a href=\"Adana\"&gt;Adana&lt;/a&gt;; \u00d6zgecan was also described as an avid opera listener and reader.\nThe perpetrator's father, who assisted him, hailed from a wealthy family in Tarsus and was at one time a jeweller. However, he had since gone bankrupt and started to work with his son as a minibus driver. He had previous records of smuggling. The perpetrator's wife (married to him five years prior to the murder) claimed that he had continuously inflicted violence on her, and that he had forced her to withdraw her suit for divorce a few months before the incident as he allegedly had threatened to kill her and their son.\nA friend of \u00d6zgecan claimed that they had been afraid to use the minibuses in the area, and that the drivers and some passengers had stared at them through mirrors and windows whenever they left the bus several times before the incident.\nMurder and search.\nOn the day of the murder, \u00d6zgecan went to a shopping center with her friend. After eating, the women took the minibus to return home. \u00d6zgecan was last seen by her friend when she alighted at her stop, leaving \u00d6zgecan alone in the minibus. As \u00d6zgecan did not return home after nightfall, she was reported missing. Meanwhile, the minibus driver stopped at a &lt;a href=\"Gendarmerie%20General%20Command\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; checkpoint to ask for directions, but instead of following the directions, diverted into a forest. The gendarme became suspicious and stopped the vehicle to find smears of blood, which the driver claimed had been caused by a fight between passengers. After a brief investigation, the suspects were released. After \u00d6zgecan was reported missing, the gendarme looked for the minibus again. It was captured with two of the suspects; \u00d6zgecan's hat (confirmed as hers by her father) was found inside. The two suspects subsequently admitted the murder, and the search for the third suspect began.\nAccording to news reports, the driver of the minibus attempted to rape \u00d6zgecan, but she resisted by using &lt;a href=\"pepper%20spray\"&gt;pepper spray&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, he stabbed her multiple times, and beat her to death with an iron rod. He returned to Tarsus following the murder and asked for help from his father and a friend. The three men burnt \u00d6zgecan's body together in a forest and cut off her hands, as \u00d6zgecan had scratched the perpetrator's face during the struggle, and they feared that his &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; would be identified on the fingernails. Later, the post-mortem examination revealed that she had not been raped and DNA of the prime suspect was indeed found on her fingernails.\nThe trio is then alleged to have disposed of the burnt body into a creek near the village of &lt;a href=\"%C3%87amalan\"&gt;\u00c7amalan&lt;/a&gt;. The body was discovered by the police on 13 February and was transported to the Tarsus State Hospital. The body and \u00d6zgecan's face were burnt to the point that it rendered identification impossible; clothes found with the body were used in identification.\nInvestigation and trial.\nInvestigation.\nDuring the initial investigation, Ahmet Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken, the minibus driver confessed that he committed the murder and that his father, Necmettin Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken, and friend, Fatih G\u00f6k\u00e7e, helped him. According to the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCrriyet\"&gt;H\u00fcrriyet&lt;/a&gt;\", he displayed a notably calm demeanor while he was questioned and answered questions in a cold-blooded manner.\nAccording to Turkish law, the defendant in such cases must have a lawyer for the criminal prosecution to begin. However, the 1,600 lawyers of the &lt;a href=\"bar%20association\"&gt;bar association&lt;/a&gt; of Mersin made a joint statement that none of them wanted to support such \"brutal savages\" in the court and refused to assign a lawyer. Two lawyers were present at the moment of questioning, but one of them was a relative of the suspects and the other was previously uninformed of the incident, and they both declined support later. This stalled the transfer of the suspects to the criminal prosecution.\nOn 16 February, the minibus driver reportedly changed his testimony, saying that, while he did commit the murder, he was under the influence of alcohol when he did so and did not intend to assault \u00d6zgecan sexually or kill her. He also claimed that it was \u00d6zgecan who started the fight by attacking him while he tried to take her to the destination through a shorter way, and that he had gone to the back of the minibus in order to have a talk with her. He reportedly claimed (with the hopes of getting a reduced sentence) that \u00d6zgecan had given him 100 Turkish liras to make him take a shortcut. But this claim was denied by her parents, who stated that they had only given 20 Turkish Liras to their daughter.\nThe father of the perpetrator reportedly stated that he was unaware of the murder when his son came, said that he had been involved in a fight and wanted a bag, claiming that he was going to bring a chicken. He then reportedly said that his son and his son's friend had slit the throat of \u00d6zgecan, before severing her hands. He claimed that his son wanted to keep her body at his father's house, but as he refused, they burned the body at a remote area, after which he also burned \u00d6zgecan's blouse, scarf, books and the strap of her bag.\nOn 20 February, it was reported that the district attorney had finished collecting evidence and was awaiting the post-mortem examination report from the Institute of Forensic Science in &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; to take action. He would allegedly demand the harshest possible sentence available, under clause 3 of the Turkish Penal Code, claiming that the murder was a case of \"monstrous and torturous homicide\", which would disqualify him from seeking a &lt;a href=\"parole\"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe post-mortem examination report was released on 23 February. The report stated that the body had been mostly burned, but that a number of wounds from stabbing and fatal cuts, especially at her neck, signs of trauma resulting from impact with blunt objects at her head and edema and bruises at various places of her body had been found. Her severed hands, which were found later, were also examined and traces of Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken's DNA were found in the nails. However, no signs of rape were detected.\nTrial.\nThe first hearing of the trial for her murder took place on 12 June. The attorney demanded aggravated life imprisonment for the suspects. The minibus driver made statements that conflicted with his prior testimony, saying that his father had learned about the murder \"at the last minute\" and that his friend had tried to rape \u00d6zgecan. The trial was postponed to 9 September. Meanwhile, the Bar of Mersin brought the cases of seven people suspected of being involved in the murder of being accomplices, including the aunt of Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken, to the Supreme Court, demanding the trial of these suspects who were previously dismissed of charges.\nOn 9 September, the attorney specifically called for the court to refrain from reducing the sentence of the defendants due to the \"outrage the case [had] caused in the society\". The defendants were not brought to the court for the hearing, but joined through a voice and video communication system. The minibus driver claimed that he had seen his friend, G\u00f6k\u00e7e, \"tightening his belt and pulling up the zip of his pants\" after descending from the vehicle and that he knew that his friend attempted sexual assault, though he did not know whether he succeeded. G\u00f6k\u00e7e denied the accusation. During the same hearing, a lawyer for \u00d6zgecan's family said that they did not agree with the attorney's conclusion that no rape took place, as Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken had traces of nail scratching on him and claimed that \u00d6zgecan's genital area was burned intentionally to prevent the detection of rape. All three defendants denied raping or being involved in the rape of \u00d6zgecan.\nThe trial concluded on 3 December as the three defendants were given aggravated life sentences without possibility of parole. The rationale for the minibus driver, Ahmet Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken, was \"murder with monstrous instinct and torture, murder with the motive of hiding a crime or evading capture, murder due to the frustration caused by the inability to commit another crime, attempt at sexual assault and deprivation of personal liberty with sexual motives\". He was given a prison sentence of an additional 27 years due to other charges. His friend, Fatih G\u00f6k\u00e7e, was sentenced to an additional 24 years due to various other charges.\nThe perpetrator is believed to be an &lt;a href=\"ultra-nationalist\"&gt;ultra-nationalist&lt;/a&gt; Turk, he had published a lot of pictures where he makes the &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Wolves%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Grey Wolves&lt;/a&gt; salutation.\nResponse.\nThe case became a \"&lt;a href=\"cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre\"&gt;cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre&lt;/a&gt;\" in Turkey as a marker of the &lt;a href=\"violence%20against%20women\"&gt;violence against women&lt;/a&gt;. The brutality of the murder especially caused a public outcry, with thousands of protesters taking to the streets across Turkey.\nIn Tarsus, a mob tried to lynch the suspects as they were arrested by the police. The funeral of \u00d6zgecan was attended by around 5000 people and women defied the &lt;a href=\"imam\"&gt;imam&lt;/a&gt; in the funeral by attending the prayer together with the men and carrying the coffin of \u00d6zgecan, against the religious tradition.\nProtests.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, protesters, most of whom were women, gathered in the &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0stiklal%20Avenue\"&gt;\u0130stiklal Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and marched to the &lt;a href=\"Taksim%20Square\"&gt;Taksim Square&lt;/a&gt; on 14 February, also condemning the alleged inaction of the government and lack of official condemnation, with thousands further protesting in the &lt;a href=\"Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y\"&gt;Kad\u0131k\u00f6y&lt;/a&gt; district. In &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, protests took place despite police intervention, as demonstrators occupied a central park. Around a thousand protesters marched in &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0zmir\"&gt;\u0130zmir&lt;/a&gt;, where almost all of them were women, who refused to let men join the protest. Protests also took place in Tarsus, Mersin, &lt;a href=\"Adana\"&gt;Adana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eski%C5%9Fehir\"&gt;Eski\u015fehir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bal%C4%B1kesir\"&gt;Bal\u0131kesir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Batman%20%28city%29\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samsun\"&gt;Samsun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antalya\"&gt;Antalya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunceli\"&gt;Tunceli&lt;/a&gt;, among other cities. Further protests took place in Istanbul on 15 February. 1,500 students marched in &lt;a href=\"Gaziantep\"&gt;Gaziantep&lt;/a&gt;. The number of protesters in Mersin were reported to be around 3000; a man reportedly harassed and attacked the women in the protests, causing a fight. In &lt;a href=\"Trabzon\"&gt;Trabzon&lt;/a&gt;, while a group of 700 women were protesting the murder, a drunk man shouted that \"the murder [was] well-deserved for \u00d6zgecan\", causing a commotion. Members of a group of 50 women who hung banners in the Taksim Square, Istanbul, were arrested by the police. Claims of the courts having sympathies for perpetrators of violence against women and thus issuing reduced sentences were highlighted during the protests. The current conservative government has also been accused of creating an \"Islamic atmosphere\", in which non-conservative women are seen as deserving violence. According to &lt;a href=\"CBC%20News\"&gt;CBC News&lt;/a&gt;, the motivation of the protesters is to show that \"female lives are not disposable in Turkey\". \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCrriyet\"&gt;H\u00fcrriyet&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that the protests had simultaneously united and divided Turkey.\nOn 15 February, around 500 people marched in &lt;a href=\"Sivas\"&gt;Sivas&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Turkish people protested in &lt;a href=\"Trafalgar%20Square\"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. Further protests took place on 16 February in &lt;a href=\"Kastamonu\"&gt;Kastamonu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karab%C3%BCk\"&gt;Karab\u00fck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ku%C5%9Fadas%C4%B1\"&gt;Ku\u015fadas\u0131&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salihli\"&gt;Salihli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burdur\"&gt;Burdur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%C4%B1r%C5%9Fehir\"&gt;K\u0131r\u015fehir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilecik\"&gt;Bilecik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denizli\"&gt;Denizli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merzifon\"&gt;Merzifon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bitlis\"&gt;Bitlis&lt;/a&gt;, Sivas, the &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20University\"&gt;Istanbul University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Giresun%20University\"&gt;Giresun University&lt;/a&gt;, where the university administration organized the protest, and the protesters held banners saying \"we are all \u00d6zgecan\". In Mersin, a crowd gathered again for protests, and the police supported the demonstrators by distributing Aslan's pictures and chanting using megaphones.\nOn 17 February, protests continued both in Turkey and abroad. Northern Cyprus saw protests as around 100 protesters, among whom were members of the parliament, held a symbolic funeral prayer and marched through the streets of the capital, &lt;a href=\"North%20Nicosia\"&gt;North Nicosia&lt;/a&gt; with a coffin. Protests also took place in &lt;a href=\"Kyrenia\"&gt;Kyrenia&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, around 200 people demonstrated on the &lt;a href=\"Hauptwache%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29\"&gt;Hauptwache&lt;/a&gt; square in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, with further protests taking place in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hannover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duisburg\"&gt;Duisburg&lt;/a&gt;. In Turkey, workers demonstrated in \u0130zmir policewomen in &lt;a href=\"I%C4%9Fd%C4%B1r\"&gt;I\u011fd\u0131r&lt;/a&gt;, graduates and students of religious schools in &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1000 people marched in &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r&lt;/a&gt;, with more protests taking place in &lt;a href=\"Mu%C5%9F\"&gt;Mu\u015f&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varto\"&gt;Varto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakk%C3%A2ri%20%28city%29\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa\"&gt;\u015eanl\u0131urfa&lt;/a&gt; and universities in Istanbul, Ankara, \u0130zmir, &lt;a href=\"Edirne\"&gt;Edirne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%87anakkale\"&gt;\u00c7anakkale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zonguldak\"&gt;Zonguldak&lt;/a&gt;, Adana, Antalya, Eski\u015fehir, Mu\u011fla and Mersin.\nOn 18 February, major protests took place in Tarsus. 15,000 people marched in the &lt;a href=\"%C3%87a%C4%9F%20University\"&gt;\u00c7a\u011f University&lt;/a&gt; and blocked a major highway. The protesters almost all wore black, with some wearing clothes soaked in makeshift blood. In Ankara, demonstrations took place in front of the Turkish parliament, where members of a major labor union gathered, and in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20Technical%20University\"&gt;Middle Eastern Technical University&lt;/a&gt;, where the demonstrators held banners saying \"it is not in the disposition of women to die, but it is to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Justice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;AKP&lt;/a&gt;\". It was claimed that a group of protesters in &lt;a href=\"Torbal%C4%B1\"&gt;Torbal\u0131&lt;/a&gt; was taken to the regional headquarters of the ruling party and questioned about their motives, leaders and whether they wanted to initiate a resurgence of the &lt;a href=\"Gezi%20Park%20protests\"&gt;Gezi Park protests&lt;/a&gt;.\nProtests continued on 19 February across Turkey despite severe weather conditions, as hundreds marched in cities including &lt;a href=\"Bart%C4%B1n\"&gt;Bart\u0131n&lt;/a&gt;, \u00c7anakkale, &lt;a href=\"K%C3%BCtahya\"&gt;K\u00fctahya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ni%C4%9Fde\"&gt;Ni\u011fde&lt;/a&gt;. A mall in Antalya projected the picture of \u00d6zgecan over an area of 6500 square meters using &lt;a href=\"LED\"&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt; lights. Her family announced their decision to channel the donations that were given to them to a fund promoting educational centers against violence against women and children.\nOn 21 February, large protests took place in Istanbul. A march was organized by the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F\"&gt;Be\u015fikta\u015f&lt;/a&gt; in central Istanbul. The march was described as \"huge\" by the press and attended by national celebrities such as &lt;a href=\"Feridun%20D%C3%BCza%C4%9Fa%C3%A7\"&gt;Feridun D\u00fcza\u011fa\u00e7&lt;/a&gt;; protesters held banners saying \"take your hands off my body\" and \"I was born free and will live as free\". On the same day, a group of women and men in skirts marched in the \u0130stiklal Avenue in Taksim. Thousands also marched in the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y district of Istanbul, as well as in \u0130zmir and Ankara. A protest in &lt;a href=\"Ak%C3%A7akoca\"&gt;Ak\u00e7akoca&lt;/a&gt; caused a discussion about the death sentence. The &lt;a href=\"Buca\"&gt;Buca&lt;/a&gt; district of \u0130zmir, Samsun and &lt;a href=\"K%C4%B1r%C4%B1kkale\"&gt;K\u0131r\u0131kkale&lt;/a&gt; saw protests, among other cities. A group also protested in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan\"&gt;Union Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical response.\nThe government response was criticized by many Turks as \"too little, too late\". Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Ahmet%20Davuto%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Ahmet Davuto\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; condemned the attack and announced that this would prompt a widespread campaign against violence against women. He also announced that a youth center in Antalya would be named after \u00d6zgecan. \u00d6zgecan's university also decided to name a newly built psychology lab after her. The Turkish Council of Ministers discussed the murder of \u00d6zgecan, but declined to condone a possible reintroduction of the death penalty for such offenses, as it had been proposed by some. President &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan&lt;/a&gt; also offered his condolences to the family of \u00d6zgecan. He later criticized the protesters, claiming that some of them had danced during the protests, committing a cultural offense due to their non-conformity to religious norms. On 17 February, he further criticized the women's rights movement in Turkey, saying that they had criticized him when he said that \"women are entrusted to men by God\", a supposition that was proved by the incident. Women's rights activists linked previous comments made by Erdo\u011fan and his fellow party members, such as \"you cannot make men and women equal\" by Erdo\u011fan and \"women should not laugh out loud in public\" by &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BClent%20Ar%C4%B1n%C3%A7\"&gt;B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7&lt;/a&gt; to an alleged attempt to solidify &lt;a href=\"gender%20role\"&gt;gender role&lt;/a&gt;s and suppress women's rights.\n&lt;a href=\"Ay%C5%9Fenur%20%C4%B0slam\"&gt;Ay\u015fenur \u0130slam&lt;/a&gt;, the Minister of Family and Social Affairs, who visited \u00d6zgecan's family, met with protests during a press statement. Members of the parliament from the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Republican People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, the main opposition in Turkey, left the parliament when she was delivering a speech about the murder. &lt;a href=\"Emine%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;Emine Erdo\u011fan&lt;/a&gt;, the first lady of Turkey, said that the fate of \u00d6zgecan \"never got out of their minds\" and that \"women were schools for their children\". Sare Davuto\u011flu, the wife of the prime minister, visited \u00d6zgecan's family.\nThe leaders of the opposition parties in the Turkish parliament sent tweets condemning the murder. &lt;a href=\"Kemal%20K%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7daro%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP), tweeted \"harassment, rape and violence are not in the disposition of women\". &lt;a href=\"Devlet%20Bah%C3%A7eli\"&gt;Devlet Bah\u00e7eli&lt;/a&gt; appealed to Erdo\u011fan, writing \"the one in the palace said that the politicians are responsible for the murders in their country; now is the time for those that are responsible and guilty to rise\". &lt;a href=\"Selahattin%20Demirta%C5%9F\"&gt;Selahattin Demirta\u015f&lt;/a&gt;, co-leader of the &lt;a href=\"Peoples%27%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Peoples' Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, said, \"if this is their perception of masculinity, we will destroy this perception and send it to the cesspool of history\". A senior official at the CHP accused the mentality of the AKP of causing the murder and cursed the previous misogynistic statements by AKP officials or allegedly pro-AKP people, such as \"it is indelicate for pregnant women to walk around in public\". The CHP and the HDP organized protests against the murder.\n&lt;a href=\"Dervi%C5%9F%20Ero%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Dervi\u015f Ero\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, the president of Northern Cyprus, called \u00d6zgecan's family to send his condolences. The American Embassy in Ankara posted a tweet condemning the murder.\nSocial media.\nThe murder sparked widespread outrage on social media, with the hashtag \"#sendeanlat\" (\"you must also tell\") becoming the most popular in the country, encouraging women to tell their own stories of harassment and everyday fears in Turkey. The campaign was also supported by popular figures in the country, including the actress &lt;a href=\"Beren%20Saat\"&gt;Beren Saat&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote a lengthy account of her experiences of harassment. It became the third most popular topic globally on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, gathering more than 440,000 tweets in two days. Women shared stories of having to carry pepper spray and pocket knives for short everyday walks, wearing fake wedding rings and getting off buses early to avoid being the last passenger. There were also stories of girls started being harassed at the age of five and schoolgirls having to endure daily harassment on buses, especially when wearing skirts.\n16 February was dubbed as \"Black Monday\" in Turkey, with many citizens, including celebrities, wearing black to raise awareness about violence against women, in accordance with the popular hashtag \"#\u00d6zgecani\u00e7insiyahgiy\" (\"wear black for \u00d6zgecan\"). The campaign was widely popular as thousands marched in black in major cities and high schools across the country complied with it. An online petition demanding more responsible decisions from institutions in cases like \u00d6zgecan's gathered more than 600,000 signatures in two days. The murder caused widespread fear among women in Tarsus, some of whom stated that they would never use the minibus again and opt for trains as much as possible instead.\nA campaign was started in &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, where men posted photos of themselves wearing mini skirts in protest, with the hashtag #ozgecanicinminietekgiy (\"wear a mini skirt for \u00d6zgecan\"). The campaign soon spread to Turkey and globally, with support from the actress &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Watson\"&gt;Emma Watson&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe responses to the murder by numerous individuals and institutions, such as singer Nihat Do\u011fan and the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Yeni%20Akit\"&gt;Yeni Akit&lt;/a&gt;\" were met with widespread condemnation outrage after being perceived to have defended rape on the grounds that &lt;a href=\"mini-skirt\"&gt;mini-skirt&lt;/a&gt;s provoked it. In a &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; deleted shortly after by Do\u011fan, he claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Secularism%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;secular system&lt;/a&gt; has \"corrupted\" individuals and that women should not call out if they were being abused by such individuals and wearing a mini-skirt at the same time. The tweet resulted in him being withdrawn from the cast of the TV show \"&lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Turkey\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt;\", his manager cutting all business ties and his suspension from the &lt;a href=\"Galatasaray%20S.K.\"&gt;Galatasaray sports club&lt;/a&gt;. Do\u011fan eventually made a live apology on &lt;a href=\"Beyaz%20TV\"&gt;Beyaz TV&lt;/a&gt;. A group of lawyers filed a criminal complaint against Do\u011fan in \u0130zmir. The Conservative newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Yeni%20Akit\"&gt;Yeni Akit&lt;/a&gt;\" blamed the murder on a \"western lifestyle\" and referred to the comments of pro-women's rights journalists such as &lt;a href=\"U%C4%9Fur%20D%C3%BCndar\"&gt;U\u011fur D\u00fcndar&lt;/a&gt; as the main cause. Numerous tweets that appeared to condone the murder on religious grounds, including on the fact that \u00d6zgecan was of Alevi origin, also drew criticism.\nCommemoration.\nMarch 19, 2016 the new Ozgecan Aslan Memorial Park opened as a tribute to the victim celebrated by a monumental sculpture representing the phoenix bird &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"\u00d6zgecan Law\".\nFollowing the murder, a petition was started to prevent reduction of sentences being given to perpetrators of violence and murder against women. The petition garnered more than 700,000 signatures within 48 hours and went on to become the most popular petition in Turkish history with more than 1,125,000 signatures. Before the &lt;a href=\"June%202015%20Turkish%20general%20election\"&gt;Turkish general election of June 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and the Republican Turkish Party (CHP) promised to pass the \"\u00d6zgecan Law\" after the election, with the HDP co-leader &lt;a href=\"Figen%20Y%C3%BCksekda%C4%9F\"&gt;Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f&lt;/a&gt; signing the petition herself. After the election, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BClay%20Yedekci\"&gt;G\u00fclay Yedekci&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the parliament from the CHP, put forward the proposal for the law on 6 July. The proposal would remove the provision for the reduction of sentences for the perpetrators of violence and murder against women upon the grounds of \"good behavior\" and \"unjust provocation\" from Article 102 of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Penal%20Code\"&gt;Turkish Penal Code&lt;/a&gt;. The proposal would also increase the penalty for &lt;a href=\"child%20marriage\"&gt;child marriage&lt;/a&gt; and remove the provisions about the \"consent\" of the child. Such proposals had already been put forward in the parliament for three years, but, according to CHP MP &lt;a href=\"Aylin%20Nazl%C4%B1aka\"&gt;Aylin Nazl\u0131aka&lt;/a&gt;, were passed over whilst laws that \"appeared to increase the freedom of women, but actually condemning them more and more to their houses\" were approved. The proposed changes were postponed again as an &lt;a href=\"November%202015%20Turkish%20general%20election\"&gt;early general election&lt;/a&gt; was scheduled for 1 November. The postponement of the \"\u00d6zgecan Law\" prompted further protests, which were supported by MPs from the CHP.\nOn 18 November, Aylin Nazl\u0131aka put forward the proposed changes again. The proposed law, however, was criticized by a group of lawyers advocating women's rights from Antalya, who claimed that the heavier sentences would increase the brutality of future violence as perpetrators would want to destroy any evidence, and that the problem lay with the sexist upbringing of children. Upon the conviction of the perpetrators on 3 December, \u00d6zgecan's mother called for the \"\u00d6zgecan Law\" to be passed as soon as possible.\nPrison attack on the murder convicts.\nWhile serving life sentence at a high-security prison in Adana, \u00d6zgecan Aslan's killer Ahmet Suphi Altindoken and his father were gunned down by an inmate in their own cell on 11 April 2016. Severely wounded, they were rushed to hospital. Ahmet Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken died; his father survived the attack. G\u00fcltekin Alan, a 46-year-old inmate serving a 50-year sentence, was found guilty. He was transferred to the high-security prison in &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo cemetery in Tarsus or Adana accepted Ahmet Suphi Alt\u0131nd\u00f6ken's funeral. The crisis lasted five days. Finally, the corpse was taken out of the hospital morgue in a midnight undercover operation masked as a woman, and was interred at an undisclosed burial site."
