A new school building was built in 1899; the high school occupied the top floor of the frame structure, and afterward it became a four-year school. In 1934, the high school got a larger building, with rooms for the sciences, home economics, and the arts. In 1957, the school expanded further to meet the needs of a growing enrollment.\nThe Dunlap Athletic Association was founded in 1915, under the direction of the school's principal. Monthly membership dues of 5 cents helped fund basketball, tennis, and track teams at the high school. Football was eventually added to the school's activities.\nDunlap was District 105 until 1945 and District 302 from 1945 to 1969; it has been &lt;a href=\"Dunlap%20Community%20Unit%20School%20District%20323\"&gt;Dunlap Community Unit School District 323&lt;/a&gt; since 1969.\nA new high school was built in 1976, with large spaces for home economics, industrial arts, a computer lab, a business department, chemistry and biology labs, music rooms, foreign language and English classes, mathematics, and fine arts. Along with the new school came updated athletic facilities, including a football stadium, and all-weather track, and a heated indoor pool.\nIn 2000, the most of the old high school was demolished, with the remaining classrooms and gym becoming \"Dunlap District #323 Activity Center.\" The rest of the old high school grounds were dedicated in 2001 as Alumni Park.\nExpansion.\nIn 2005, Dunlap underwent an addition of 10 new freshman classrooms, a new auditorium, an auxiliary gym, and music/art classrooms, it was completed in time for the start of the 2005\u20132006 school year.\nIn 2010, DHS added ten classrooms, including two computer labs and a science lab.\nIn 2011, the athletics facilities at the school were renovated at a cost of $5,000,000, including an artificial turf football field, new soccer and tennis complexes, and added concession stands.\nPhase II of the renovation process began in mid August 2013 and included a two-story addition with an additional 17 classrooms, additional locker rooms, additional student lockers, cafeteria and kitchen expansions, new science labs, and a robotics lab. It was completed in time for the start of the 2014\u20132015 school year.\nIn September 2017, the newly redesigned and expanded Library was unveiled.\n2018 saw the opening of a new press box for the on-campus baseball stadium named after former student Nicholas J.
