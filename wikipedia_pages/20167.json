    "text": "Mexican cuisine consists of the cooking cuisines and traditions of the modern country of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Its earliest roots lie in &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20Cuisine\"&gt;Mesoamerican cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. Its ingredients and methods begin with the first agricultural communities such as the &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; who domesticated &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;, created the standard process of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nixtamalization\"&gt;nixtamalization&lt;/a&gt;, and established their foodways (&lt;a href=\"Maya%20cuisine\"&gt;Maya cuisine&lt;/a&gt;). Successive waves of other &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt;n groups brought with them their own cooking methods. These included: the &lt;a href=\"Olmec\"&gt;Olmec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teotihuacan\"&gt;Teotihuacan&lt;/a&gt;os, &lt;a href=\"Toltec\"&gt;Toltec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huastec%20civilization\"&gt;Huastec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zapotec%20civilization\"&gt;Zapotec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mixtec\"&gt;Mixtec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otomi%20people\"&gt;Otomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarascan%20state\"&gt;Pur\u00e9pecha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Totonac\"&gt;Totonac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazatec\"&gt;Mazatec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazahua%20people\"&gt;Mazahua&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nahuas\"&gt;Nahua&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Mexica\"&gt;Mexica&lt;/a&gt; formation of the multi-ethnic Triple Alliance (&lt;a href=\"Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Aztec Empire&lt;/a&gt;), culinary foodways became infused (&lt;a href=\"Aztec%20cuisine\"&gt;Aztec cuisine&lt;/a&gt;). \nToday's food staples are native to the land and include: corn (&lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"bean\"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squash%20%28plant%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amaranth\"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chia%20seed\"&gt;chia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"avocado\"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"tomatillo\"&gt;tomatillo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20bean\"&gt;cacao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vanilla\"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agave\"&gt;agave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turkey%20meat\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirulina%20%28dietary%20supplement%29%23Historical%20use\"&gt;spirulina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20potato\"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cactus%23Food\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chili%20pepper\"&gt;chili pepper&lt;/a&gt;. Its history over the centuries has resulted in regional cuisines based on local conditions, including &lt;a href=\"Baja%20Med\"&gt;Baja Med&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Chiapas\"&gt;Chiapas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oaxacan%20cuisine\"&gt;Oaxacan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"American%20cuisine\"&gt;American cuisine&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexican%20cuisine\"&gt;New Mexican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tex-Mex\"&gt;Tex-Mex&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish Conquest of the Aztec empire&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Mesoamerica, Spaniards introduced a number of &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20cuisine\"&gt;other foods&lt;/a&gt;, the most important of which were meats from domesticated animals (&lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;), dairy products (especially cheese and milk), &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and various fruits and vegetables. Various cooking styles and recipes were also introduced from Spain both throughout the colonial period and by Spanish immigrants who continued to arrive following independence. Spanish influence in Mexican cuisine is also noticeable in its sweets such as: &lt;a href=\"Alfajor\"&gt;alfajores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfe%C3%B1ique\"&gt;alfeniques&lt;/a&gt;, borrachitos and &lt;a href=\"Churro\"&gt;churros&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Asian%20cuisine\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"African%20cuisine\"&gt;African influences&lt;/a&gt; were also introduced during this era as a result of &lt;a href=\"Afro-Mexican%23African%20slavery%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;African slavery in New Spain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manila-Acapulco%20Galleon\"&gt;Manila-Acapulco Galleon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of &lt;a href=\"Mole%20sauce\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country. For this reason and others, traditional Mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the &lt;a href=\"Representative%20List%20of%20the%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20of%20Humanity\"&gt;Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasic elements.\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history. It is created mostly with ingredients native to Mexico, as well as those &lt;a href=\"Columbian%20Exchange\"&gt;brought over&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20cuisine\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conquistador\"&gt;conquistador&lt;/a&gt;s, with some new influences since then. Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border. For example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in &lt;a href=\"tortillas\"&gt;tortillas&lt;/a&gt; for field labor. Modifications like these brought Mexican cuisine to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, where states like Arizona further adapted burritos by deep frying them, creating the modern &lt;a href=\"chimichanga\"&gt;chimichanga&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to staples, such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include &lt;a href=\"tomato\"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Squash%20%28plant%29\"&gt;squashes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"avocado\"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cocoa%20bean\"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vanilla\"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;, as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines, such as &lt;a href=\"edible%20flowers\"&gt;edible flowers&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables like &lt;a href=\"huauzontle\"&gt;huauzontle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porophyllum%20ruderale\"&gt;papaloquelite&lt;/a&gt;, or small &lt;a href=\"avocado%23history\"&gt;criollo&lt;/a&gt; avocados, whose skin is edible. &lt;a href=\"Chocolate\"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/a&gt; originated in Mexico and was prized by the Aztecs. It remains an important ingredient in Mexican cookery.\nVegetables play an important role in Mexican cuisine. Common vegetables include &lt;a href=\"zucchini\"&gt;zucchini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cauliflower\"&gt;cauliflower&lt;/a&gt;, corn, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"spinach\"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20chard\"&gt;Swiss chard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edible%20mushroom\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, jitomate (red tomato), green tomato, etc. Other traditional vegetable ingredients include &lt;a href=\"Chili%20pepper\"&gt;Chili pepper&lt;/a&gt;, huitlacoche (corn fungus), huauzontle, and &lt;a href=\"nopal\"&gt;nopal&lt;/a&gt; (cactus pads) to name a few.\nEuropean contributions include &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chicken%20as%20food\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spices\"&gt;spices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some fruits.\n&lt;a href=\"Tropical%20fruits\"&gt;Tropical fruits&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are indigenous to Mexico and the Americas, such as &lt;a href=\"guava\"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Opuntia\"&gt;prickly pear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sapote\"&gt;sapote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mango\"&gt;mango&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"banana\"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pineapple\"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cherimoya\"&gt;cherimoya&lt;/a&gt; (custard apple) are popular, especially in the center and south of the country.\nEdible insects have been enjoyed in Mexico for millennia. &lt;a href=\"Entomophagy\"&gt;Entemophagy&lt;/a&gt; or insect-eating is becoming increasingly popular outside of poor and rural areas for its unique flavors, sustainability, and connection to pre-Hispanic heritage. Popular species include &lt;a href=\"chapulines\"&gt;chapulines&lt;/a&gt; (grasshoppers or crickets), &lt;a href=\"escamol\"&gt;escamol&lt;/a&gt;es (ant larvae), cumiles (&lt;a href=\"Brown%20marmorated%20stink%20bug\"&gt;stink bugs&lt;/a&gt;) and (water bug eggs).\nCorn.\nDespite the introduction of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; to Mexico, corn is the most commonly consumed starch in almost all areas of the country and serves as the main ingredient in many local recipes (e.g. corn &lt;a href=\"tortilla\"&gt;tortilla&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"atole\"&gt;atole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pozole\"&gt;pozole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menudo%20%28soup%29\"&gt;menudo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tamal\"&gt;tamal&lt;/a&gt;). While it is eaten fresh, most corn is dried, &lt;a href=\"Nixtamalization\"&gt;nixtamalized&lt;/a&gt; and ground into a dough called \"&lt;a href=\"masa\"&gt;masa&lt;/a&gt;\". This dough is used both fresh and fermented to make a wide variety of dishes from drinks (atole, pozole, etc.) to tamales, &lt;a href=\"Sope%20%28food%29\"&gt;sope&lt;/a&gt;s, and much more. However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico is in the form of a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20banana\"&gt;plantain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yuca\"&gt;yuca&lt;/a&gt; and wild greens in &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca\"&gt;Oaxaca&lt;/a&gt;.\nChili peppers.\nThe other basic ingredient in all parts of Mexico is the &lt;a href=\"Chili%20pepper\"&gt;chile pepper&lt;/a&gt;. Mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. Many dishes also have subtle flavors. Chiles are indigenous to Mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. They are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with Mexico using the widest variety. If a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.\nThe importance of the chile goes back to the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican\"&gt;Mesoamerican&lt;/a&gt; period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. In the 16th century, &lt;a href=\"Bartolom%C3%A9%20de%20las%20Casas\"&gt;Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas&lt;/a&gt; wrote that without chiles, the &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20people\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; did not think they were eating. Even today, most &lt;a href=\"Mexicans\"&gt;Mexicans&lt;/a&gt; believe that their national identity would be at a loss without chiles and the many varieties of sauces and salsas created using chiles as their base.\nMany dishes in Mexico are defined by their sauces and the chiles those sauces contain (which are usually very spicy), rather than the meat or vegetable that the sauce covers. These dishes include &lt;a href=\"entomatada\"&gt;entomatada&lt;/a&gt; (in tomato sauce), &lt;a href=\"adobo\"&gt;adobo&lt;/a&gt; or adobados, pipians and &lt;a href=\"Mole%20sauce\"&gt;moles&lt;/a&gt;. A hominy soup called &lt;a href=\"pozole\"&gt;pozole&lt;/a&gt; is defined as white, green or red depending on the chile sauce used or omitted. Tamales are differentiated by the filling which is again defined by the sauce (red or green chile pepper strips or mole). Dishes without a sauce are rarely eaten without a salsa or without fresh or pickled chiles. This includes street foods, such as &lt;a href=\"taco\"&gt;taco&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"torta\"&gt;torta&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20soup%23Mexico\"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sope%20%28food%29\"&gt;sope&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tlacoyo\"&gt;tlacoyo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tlayuda\"&gt;tlayuda&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gordita\"&gt;gordita&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sincronizada\"&gt;sincronizada&lt;/a&gt;s. For most dishes, it is the type of chile used that gives it its main flavor. &lt;a href=\"Chipotle\"&gt;Chipotle&lt;/a&gt;, smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is very common in Mexican cuisine.\nSpanish contributions.\nTogether with Mesoamerica, Spain is the second basis of Mexican cuisine, contributing in two fundamental ways: Firstly, they brought with them old world staples and ingredients which did not exist in the Americas such as sugar, wheat, rice, onions, garlic, limes, oil, dairy products, pork, beef and many others.\nSecondly they brought various culinary traditions from the Iberian peninsula which have become prevalent in Mexico. Equally, the discovery of the incorporation of New World ingredients to Spanish cuisine has led to many shared foods such as chorizo which uses paprika. \nSpanish cuisine was in turn heavily influenced by its Moorish heritage and this created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest &lt;a href=\"Fusion%20cuisine\"&gt;Fusion cuisine&lt;/a&gt;s. The Spanish also introduced the technique of frying in &lt;a href=\"Lard\"&gt;pork fat&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the main meats found in Mexico are pork, chicken, beef, goat, and sheep. Seafood and &lt;a href=\"Fish%20as%20food\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; are also popular, especially along the coasts, and the way of cooking it commonly has Spanish origin such as Huachinango a la vizcaina.\n&lt;a href=\"Cheeses%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Cheesemaking in Mexico&lt;/a&gt; has evolved its own specialties, although uniquely Spanish cheese such as Manchego is also typical of Mexico. It is an important economic activity, especially in the north, and is frequently done at home. The main cheese-making areas are &lt;a href=\"Chihuahua%20%28state%29\"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca\"&gt;Oaxaca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quer%C3%A9taro\"&gt;Quer\u00e9taro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chiapas\"&gt;Chiapas&lt;/a&gt;. Goat cheese is still made, but it is not as popular and is harder to find in stores.\n&lt;a href=\"Churro\"&gt;Churros&lt;/a&gt; are a common snack originating in Spain and because &lt;a href=\"Sugarcane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the Americas through &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish colonization&lt;/a&gt;, all of Mexico's sweets have a Hispanic origin, often with a Muslim heritage such as &lt;a href=\"Alfe%C3%B1ique\"&gt;Alfe\u00f1iques&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood and society.\nHome cooking.\nIn most of Mexico, especially in rural areas, much of the food is consumed in the home. Cooking for the family is usually considered to be &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20work\"&gt;women's work&lt;/a&gt;, and this includes cooking for &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;celebrations&lt;/a&gt; as well. Traditionally girls have been considered ready to &lt;a href=\"marry\"&gt;marry&lt;/a&gt; when they can cook, and &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; is considered a main talent for &lt;a href=\"Housewife\"&gt;housewives&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main meal of the day in Mexico is the \"comida\", meaning 'meal' in Spanish. This refers to &lt;a href=\"dinner\"&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"supper\"&gt;supper&lt;/a&gt;. It sometimes begins with &lt;a href=\"soup\"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href=\"chicken%20broth\"&gt;chicken broth&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"pasta\"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt; or a \"dry soup\", which is pasta or rice flavored with &lt;a href=\"onions\"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"garlic\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; or vegetables. The main course is &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; served in a cooked &lt;a href=\"sauce\"&gt;sauce&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Salsa%20%28sauce%29\"&gt;salsa&lt;/a&gt; on the side, accompanied with beans and tortillas and often with a fruit drink.\nIn the evening, it is common to eat leftovers from the comida or sweet &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20breads\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chocolate\"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. Breakfast can consist of meat in broth (such as &lt;a href=\"pancita\"&gt;pancita&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"taco\"&gt;taco&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enchilada\"&gt;enchilada&lt;/a&gt;s or meat with &lt;a href=\"Egg%20as%20food\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;. This is usually served with beans, tortillas, and coffee or &lt;a href=\"juice\"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood and festivals.\nMexican cuisine is elaborate and often tied to symbolism and festivals, which is one reason it was named as an example of the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists\"&gt;Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the foods of Mexico are complicated because of their relation to the social structure of the country. Food preparation, especially for family and social events, is considered to be an investment in order to maintain social relationships. Even the idea of flavor is considered to be social, with meals prepared for certain dinners and certain occasions when they are considered the most tasty.\nThe ability to cook well, called \"saz\u00f3n\" (lit. seasoning) is considered to be a gift generally gained from experience and a sense of commitment to the diners. For the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; festival, foods such as tamales and mole are set out on altars and it is believed that the visiting dead relatives eat the essence of the food. If eaten afterwards by the living it is considered to be tasteless. In central Mexico, the main festival foods are mole, &lt;a href=\"barbacoa\"&gt;barbacoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carnitas\"&gt;carnitas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mixiote\"&gt;mixiote&lt;/a&gt;s. They are often prepared to feed hundreds of guests, requiring groups of cooks. The cooking is part of the social custom meant to bind families and communities.\nMexican regional home cooking is completely different from the food served in most Mexican restaurants outside Mexico, which is usually some variety of &lt;a href=\"Tex-Mex\"&gt;Tex-Mex&lt;/a&gt;. The original versions of Mexican dishes are vastly different from their Tex-Mex variation. \nSome of Mexico's traditional foods involved complex or long cooking processes, including cooking underground (such as &lt;a href=\"cochinita%20pibil\"&gt;cochinita pibil&lt;/a&gt;). Before industrialization, traditional women spent several hours a day boiling dried corn then grinding it on a &lt;a href=\"metate\"&gt;metate&lt;/a&gt; to make the dough for tortillas, cooking them one-by-one on a &lt;a href=\"Comal%20%28cookware%29\"&gt;comal&lt;/a&gt; griddle. In some areas, tortillas are still made this way. Sauces and salsas were also ground in a mortar called a &lt;a href=\"molcajete\"&gt;molcajete&lt;/a&gt;. Today, blenders are more often used, though the texture is a bit different. Most people in Mexico would say that those made with a molcajete taste better, but few do this now.\nThe most important food for festivals and other special occasions is &lt;a href=\"Mole%20sauce\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt;, especially mole poblano in the center of the country. Mole is served at Christmas, Easter, Day of the Dead and at birthdays, baptisms, weddings and funerals, and tends to be eaten only for special occasions because it is such a complex and time-consuming dish. While still dominant in this way, other foods have become acceptable for these occasions, such as barbacoa, carnitas and mixiotes, especially since the 1980s. This may have been because of economic crises at that time, allowing for the substitution of these cheaper foods, or the fact that they can be bought ready-made or may already be made as part of the family business.\nAnother important festive food is the &lt;a href=\"tamale\"&gt;tamale&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"tamal\" in Spanish. This is a filled cornmeal dumpling, steamed in a wrapping (usually a corn &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt; or banana leaf) and one of the basic staples in most regions of Mexico. It has its origins in the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Columbian%20era\"&gt;pre-Hispanic era&lt;/a&gt; and today is found in many varieties in all of Mexico. Like mole, it is complicated to prepare and best done in large amounts. Tamales are associated with certain celebrations such as &lt;a href=\"Candlemas\"&gt;Candlemas&lt;/a&gt;. They are wrapped in corn husks in the highlands and desert areas of Mexico and in banana leaves in the tropics.\nStreet food.\nMexican street food can include tacos, &lt;a href=\"quesadilla\"&gt;quesadilla&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pambazo\"&gt;pambazo&lt;/a&gt;s, tamales, &lt;a href=\"Huarache%20%28food%29\"&gt;huaraches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alambre\"&gt;alambre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"al%20pastor\"&gt;al pastor&lt;/a&gt;, and food not suitable to cook at home, including barbacoa, carnitas, and since many homes in Mexico do not have or make use of ovens, &lt;a href=\"Roast%20chicken\"&gt;roasted chicken&lt;/a&gt;. One attraction of street food in Mexico is the satisfaction of hunger or craving without all the social and emotional connotation of eating at home, although longtime customers can have something of a friendship/familial relationship with a chosen vendor.\nTacos are the top-rated and most well-known street Mexican food. It is made up of meat or other fillings wrapped in a tortilla often served with cheese added. Vegetarian fillings include mushrooms, potatoes, rice, or beans.\nThe best known of Mexico's street foods is the taco, whose origin is based on the pre-Hispanic custom of picking up other foods with tortillas as utensils were not used. The origin of the word is in dispute, with some saying it is derived from &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; and others from various Spanish phrases. It possible the term taco comes from the term tlaco or tlacatl, which means middle or half in nahuatl. Tacos are not eaten as the main meal; they are generally eaten before midday or late in the evening. Just about any other foodstuff can be wrapped in a tortilla, and in Mexico, it varies from rice, to meat (plain or in sauce), to cream, to vegetables, to cheese, or simply to plain chile peppers or fresh salsa. Preferred fillings vary from region to region with pork generally found more often in the center and south, beef in the north, seafood along the coasts, and chicken and &lt;a href=\"Lamb%20and%20mutton\"&gt;lamb&lt;/a&gt; in most of the country.\nAnother popular street food, especially in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding area is the &lt;a href=\"Torta%23Mexican%20sandwich\"&gt;torta&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of a roll of some type, stuffed with several ingredients. This has its origins in the 19th century, when the French introduced a number of new kinds of bread. The torta began by splitting the roll and adding beans. Today, &lt;a href=\"refried%20beans\"&gt;refried beans&lt;/a&gt; can still be found on many kinds of tortas. In Mexico City, the most common roll used for tortas is called \"&lt;a href=\"Telera%20%28bread%29\"&gt;telera&lt;/a&gt;\", a relatively flat roll with two splits on the upper surface. In Puebla, the preferred bread is called a &lt;a href=\"cemita\"&gt;cemita&lt;/a&gt;, as is the sandwich. In both areas, the bread is stuffed with various fillings, especially if it is a hot sandwich, with beans, &lt;a href=\"cream\"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"mayonnaise\"&gt;mayonnaise&lt;/a&gt; is rare) and some kind of hot chile pepper.\nThe influence of American fast food on Mexican street food grew during the late 20th century. One example of this is the invention of the &lt;a href=\"Sonoran%20hot%20dog\"&gt;Sonoran hot dog&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1980s. The &lt;a href=\"Hot%20dog\"&gt;frankfurters&lt;/a&gt; are usually boiled then wrapped in &lt;a href=\"bacon\"&gt;bacon&lt;/a&gt; and fried. They are served in a &lt;a href=\"bolillo\"&gt;bolillo&lt;/a&gt;-style bun, typically topped by a combination of &lt;a href=\"pinto%20bean\"&gt;pinto bean&lt;/a&gt;s, diced tomatoes, onions and &lt;a href=\"jalape%C3%B1o\"&gt;jalape\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; peppers, and other condiments.\nAlong the US-Mexican border, specifically dense areas like Tijuana, Mexican vendors sell food such as &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20salad\"&gt;fruit melanged&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Taj%C3%ADn%20%28seasoning%29\"&gt;Tajin&lt;/a&gt; spice to people crossing the border via carts. In recent years, these &lt;a href=\"food%20carts\"&gt;food carts&lt;/a&gt; have been threatened by tightened border security at the port of entry. Both the US and the Mexican governments have proposed a project that would widen the streets at the border, allowing for more people to pass through the border, although widening them would decimate neighboring &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;mercados&lt;/a&gt; that rely on the business of travelers.\nBesides food, street vendors also sell various kinds of drinks (including , , and ) and treats (such as , , and ). Most tamale stands sell as a standard accompaniment.\nHistory.\nPre-Hispanic period.\nAround 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America hunted &lt;a href=\"Game%20%28hunting%29\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; and gathered &lt;a href=\"Plant-based%20diet\"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;, including wild &lt;a href=\"Chili%20pepper\"&gt;chili peppers&lt;/a&gt;. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted &lt;a href=\"agave\"&gt;agave&lt;/a&gt; hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called &lt;a href=\"nixtamalization\"&gt;nixtamalization&lt;/a&gt;, or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for grinding and improve its nutritional value. This allowed the creation of tortillas and other kinds of flat breads. The indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica have numerous stories about the origin of corn, usually related to being a gift of one or more gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Quetzalcoatl\"&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other staple was beans, eaten with corn and some other plants as a complementary protein. Other protein sources included &lt;a href=\"amaranth\"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"domesticated%20turkey\"&gt;domesticated turkey&lt;/a&gt;, insects such as &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ant\"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt; larvae, &lt;a href=\"iguana\"&gt;iguana&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; eggs on the &lt;a href=\"coast\"&gt;coast&lt;/a&gt;lines. Vegetables included squash and their seeds; &lt;a href=\"chilacayote\"&gt;chilacayote&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"jicama\"&gt;jicama&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of sweet potato; and &lt;a href=\"edible%20flower\"&gt;edible flower&lt;/a&gt;s, especially those of squash. The chile pepper was used as food, ritual and as medicine.\nWhen the Spanish arrived, the &lt;a href=\"Aztec\"&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt;s had sophisticated &lt;a href=\"agricultural\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; techniques and an abundance of food, which was the base of their economy. It allowed them to expand an empire, bringing in &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; which consisted mostly of foods the Aztecs could not grow themselves. According to &lt;a href=\"Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn\"&gt;Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nahua%20peoples\"&gt;Nahua peoples&lt;/a&gt; of central Mexico ate corn, beans, turkey, fish, small game, insects and a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href=\"pulses\"&gt;pulses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tubers\"&gt;tubers&lt;/a&gt;, wild &lt;a href=\"Edible%20mushroom\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, plants and &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; that they collected or cultivated.\nModern Period.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, the Spanish introduced a variety of foodstuffs and cooking techniques, like &lt;a href=\"frying\"&gt;frying&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt;. Regional cuisines remained varied, with native staples more prevalent in the rural southern areas and Spanish foods taking root in the more sparsely populated northern region. European style wheat bread was initially met unfavorably with Moctezuma's emissaries who reportedly described it as tasting of \"dried maize stalks\". On the Spanish side, &lt;a href=\"Bernal%20D%C3%ADaz%20del%20Castillo\"&gt;Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo&lt;/a&gt; complained about the \"maize cake\" rations on campaign.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cuisine%20of%20Spain\"&gt;cuisine of Spain&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20cuisine\"&gt;Mediterranean cuisine&lt;/a&gt; influenced by its &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; period composed of a number of staples such as &lt;a href=\"Olive%20oil\"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and rice. Spanish settlers introduced these staples to the region, although some continued to be imported such as &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brandy\"&gt;brandy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nut%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"olives\"&gt;olives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spices\"&gt;spices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"capers\"&gt;capers&lt;/a&gt;. They introduced domesticated animals, such as &lt;a href=\"pigs\"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cows\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chickens\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, raising the consumption of protein. &lt;a href=\"Cheese\"&gt;Cheese&lt;/a&gt; became the most important dairy product.\nThe Spanish brought &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, used extensively creation of many kinds of sweets, especially local &lt;a href=\"fruits\"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"syrup\"&gt;syrup&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;-based candy craft called &lt;a href=\"alfe%C3%B1ique\"&gt;alfe\u00f1ique&lt;/a&gt; was imported and is now used for the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Over time ingredients like &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"onions\"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"garlic\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oregano\"&gt;oregano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coriander\"&gt;coriander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cinnamon\"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clove\"&gt;clove&lt;/a&gt;s became incorporated with native ingredients and cooking techniques. One of the main avenues for the mixing of the two cuisines was in &lt;a href=\"convents\"&gt;convents&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the influence of Spanish culture, Mexican cuisine has maintained its base of corn, beans and chili peppers. Natives continued to be reliant on maize; it was less expensive than the &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; favored by European settlers, it was easier to cultivate and produced higher yields. European control over the land grew stronger with the founding of wheat farms. In 18th century &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, wheat was baked into leaved rolls called \"pan frances\" or \"pan espanol\", but only two bakers were allowed to bake this style of bread and they worked on consignment to the viceroy and the archbishop. Large ring loaves of choice flour known as \"pan floreado\" were available for wealthy \"Creoles\". Other styles of bread used lower-quality wheat and maize to produce \"pan comun\", \"&lt;a href=\"pambazo\"&gt;pambazo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"cemita\".\n&lt;a href=\"Pozole\"&gt;Pozole&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned in the 16th century &lt;a href=\"Florentine%20Codex\"&gt;Florentine Codex&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn\"&gt;Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the eighteenth century, an Italian &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin\"&gt;Capuchin&lt;/a&gt; friar, &lt;a href=\"Ilarione%20da%20Bergamo\"&gt;Ilarione da Bergamo&lt;/a&gt;, included descriptions of food in his &lt;a href=\"Travel%20literature\"&gt;travelogue&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that &lt;a href=\"tortillas\"&gt;tortillas&lt;/a&gt; were eaten not only by the poor, by the upper class as well. He described lunch fare as pork products like &lt;a href=\"chorizo\"&gt;chorizo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ham\"&gt;ham&lt;/a&gt; being eaten between tortillas, with a piquant red chili sauce. For drink &lt;a href=\"pulque\"&gt;pulque&lt;/a&gt;, as well as corn-based &lt;a href=\"atole\"&gt;atole&lt;/a&gt;, and for those who could afford it chocolate-based drinks were consumed twice a day. According to de Bergamo's account neither coffee nor wine are consumed, and evening meals ended with a small portion of beans in a thick soup instead, \"served to set the stage for drinking water\".\nDuring the 19th century, Mexico experienced an influx of various immigrants, including &lt;a href=\"French%20Mexicans\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Mexicans\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20Mexicans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Mexicans\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Mexicans\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, which have had some effect on the food. During the &lt;a href=\"French%20intervention%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;French intervention in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20cuisine\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; food became popular with the upper classes. An influence on these new trends came from chef Tudor, who was brought to Mexico by the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Maximilian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;. One lasting evidence of this is the variety of breads and sweet breads, such as &lt;a href=\"bolillos\"&gt;bolillos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concha%20%28bread%29\"&gt;conchas&lt;/a&gt; and much more, which can be found in Mexican bakeries. The &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; brought beer brewing techniques and the &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; added their cuisine to certain areas of the country. This led to Mexico characterizing its cuisine more by its relation to popular traditions rather than on particular cooking techniques.\nSince the 20th century, there has been an interchange of food influences between Mexico and the United States. Mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20the%20Southwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southwest United States&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Mexican\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Kennedy\"&gt;Diana Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, in her book \"The Cuisines of Mexico\" (published in 1972), drew a sharp distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex.\nTex-Mex food was developed from Mexican and Anglo influences, and was traced to the late 19th century in Texas. It still continues to develop with flour tortillas becoming popular north of the border only in the latter 20th century. From north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Revolution\"&gt;Mexican Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. One other very visible sign of influence from the United States is the appearance of &lt;a href=\"fast%20foods\"&gt;fast foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"hamburgers\"&gt;hamburgers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hot%20dogs\"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pizza\"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the latter 20th century, international influence in Mexico has led to interest and development of &lt;a href=\"haute%20cuisine\"&gt;haute cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. In Mexico, many professional chefs are trained in French or international cuisine, but the use of Mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. It is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other &lt;a href=\"hors%20d%27oeuvre\"&gt;hors d'oeuvre&lt;/a&gt;s at fancy dinner parties in Mexico.\nProfessional cookery in Mexico is growing and includes an emphasis on traditional methods and ingredients. In the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic Mexican food. This movement is traceable to 1982 with the Mexican Culinary Circle of Mexico City. It was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods. In 2010, Mexico's cuisine was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, &lt;a href=\"sushi\"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on &lt;a href=\"mango\"&gt;mango&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tamarind\"&gt;tamarind&lt;/a&gt;, and very often served with &lt;a href=\"Serrano%20pepper\"&gt;serrano&lt;/a&gt;-chili blended &lt;a href=\"soy\"&gt;soy&lt;/a&gt; sauce, or complemented with &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"habanero%20pepper\"&gt;habanero pepper&lt;/a&gt;s, and chipotle peppers.\nBeverages.\nCorn in Mexico is not only eaten, but also drunk as a beverage. Corn is the base of a hot drink called &lt;a href=\"atole\"&gt;atole&lt;/a&gt;, which is then flavored with fruit, chocolate, rice or other flavors. Fermented corn is the base of a cold drink, which goes by different names and varieties, such as &lt;a href=\"tejuino\"&gt;tejuino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pozol\"&gt;pozol&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;a href=\"Aguas%20frescas\"&gt;Aguas frescas&lt;/a&gt; are flavored drinks usually made from fruit, water and sugar. Beverages also include &lt;a href=\"hibiscus\"&gt;hibiscus&lt;/a&gt; iced tea, one made from &lt;a href=\"tamarind\"&gt;tamarind&lt;/a&gt; and one from rice called \"&lt;a href=\"horchata\"&gt;horchata&lt;/a&gt;\". One variant of coffee is &lt;a href=\"caf%C3%A9%20de%20olla\"&gt;caf\u00e9 de olla&lt;/a&gt;, which is coffee brewed with cinnamon and raw sugar. Many of the most popular beverages can be found sold by street vendors and &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20juice%20bar\"&gt;juice bars&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico.\nChocolate played an important part in the history of Mexican cuisine. The word \"chocolate\" originated from Mexico's &lt;a href=\"Aztec\"&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt; cuisine, derived from the &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; word \"&lt;a href=\"Chocolate\"&gt;xocolatl&lt;/a&gt;\". Chocolate was first drunk rather than eaten. It was also used for religious rituals. The &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya civilization&lt;/a&gt; grew cacao trees and used the cacao seeds it produced to make a frothy, bitter drink. The drink, called \"xocoatl\", was often flavored with vanilla, chile pepper, and \"&lt;a href=\"Annatto\"&gt;achiote&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAlcoholic beverages from Mexico include &lt;a href=\"tequila\"&gt;tequila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pulque\"&gt;pulque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aguardiente\"&gt;aguardiente&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mezcal\"&gt;mezcal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"charanda\"&gt;charanda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wine\"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rum\"&gt;rum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; are also produced. The most common alcoholic beverage consumed with food in Mexico is beer, followed by tequila. A classic &lt;a href=\"margarita\"&gt;margarita&lt;/a&gt;, a popular cocktail, is composed of tequila, &lt;a href=\"cointreau\"&gt;cointreau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lime%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt; juice.\n&lt;a href=\"Rompope\"&gt;Rompope&lt;/a&gt; is believed to have been originally made in the &lt;a href=\"convent\"&gt;convent&lt;/a&gt;s of the city of &lt;a href=\"Puebla%2C%20Puebla\"&gt;Puebla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"rompope\" is a derivation of the word \"rompon\", which is used to describe the Spanish version of &lt;a href=\"eggnog\"&gt;eggnog&lt;/a&gt; that came to Mexico.\nA popular &lt;a href=\"Soft%20drink\"&gt;Soft drink&lt;/a&gt; from Mexico is &lt;a href=\"Sangria%20Se%C3%B1orial\"&gt;Sangria Se\u00f1orial&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"sangria\"&gt;sangria&lt;/a&gt;-flavored, non-alcoholic beverage. Sangria is a Spanish drink that was introduced by &lt;a href=\"Spaniards\"&gt;Spaniards&lt;/a&gt;, as was Horchata and Agua de Jamaica.\nRegional cuisines.\nChiapas.\nSimilar to other regions in Mexico, corn is a dietary staple and other indigenous foods remain strong in the cuisine as well. Along with a chile called simojovel, used nowhere else in the country, the cuisine is also distinguished by the use of herbs, such as &lt;a href=\"chipil%C3%ADn\"&gt;chipil\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piper%20auritum\"&gt;hierba santa&lt;/a&gt;. Like in Oaxaca, tamales are usually wrapped in &lt;a href=\"banana%20leaves\"&gt;banana leaves&lt;/a&gt; (or sometimes with the leaves of &lt;a href=\"hoja%20santa\"&gt;hoja santa&lt;/a&gt;), but often chipil\u00edn is incorporated into the dough. As in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, boiled corn is drunk as a beverage called &lt;a href=\"pozol\"&gt;pozol&lt;/a&gt;, but here it is usually flavored with all-natural cacao. Another beverage (which can be served hot or cold) typical from this region is &lt;a href=\"Tascalate\"&gt;Tascalate&lt;/a&gt;, which is made of powdered maize, cocoa beans, achiote (&lt;a href=\"annatto\"&gt;annatto&lt;/a&gt;), chilies, &lt;a href=\"pine%20nuts\"&gt;pine nuts&lt;/a&gt; and cinnamon.\nThe favored meats are beef, pork and chicken (introduced by the Spanish), especially in the highlands, which favors the raising of livestock. The livestock industry has also prompted the making of cheese, mostly done on &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;es and in small &lt;a href=\"cooperatives\"&gt;cooperatives&lt;/a&gt;, with the best known from &lt;a href=\"Ocosingo\"&gt;Ocosingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%C3%B3n%2C%20Chiapas\"&gt;Ray\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pijijiapan\"&gt;Pijijiapan&lt;/a&gt;. Meat and cheese dishes are frequently accompanied by vegetables, such as squash, &lt;a href=\"chayote\"&gt;chayote&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"carrots\"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt;.\nMexico City.\nThe main feature of &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; cooking is that it has been influenced by those of the other regions of Mexico, as well as a number of foreign influences. This is because Mexico City has been a center for migration of people from all over Mexico since pre-Hispanic times. Most of the ingredients of this area's cooking are not grown &lt;a href=\"in%20situ\"&gt;in situ&lt;/a&gt;, but imported from all of the country (such as tropical fruits).\nStreet cuisine is very popular, with &lt;a href=\"taco%20stand\"&gt;taco stand&lt;/a&gt;s, and lunch counters on every street. Popular foods in the city include &lt;a href=\"barbacoa\"&gt;barbacoa&lt;/a&gt; (a specialty of the central highlands), &lt;a href=\"birria\"&gt;birria&lt;/a&gt; (from western Mexico), &lt;a href=\"cabrito\"&gt;cabrito&lt;/a&gt; (from the north), &lt;a href=\"carnitas\"&gt;carnitas&lt;/a&gt; (originally from &lt;a href=\"Michoac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Michoac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Mole%20%28sauce%29\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; sauces (from &lt;a href=\"Puebla\"&gt;Puebla&lt;/a&gt; and central Mexico), tacos with many different fillings, and large &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20sandwich\"&gt;sub&lt;/a&gt;-like sandwiches called &lt;a href=\"Torta%23Mexico\"&gt;torta&lt;/a&gt;s, usually served at specialized shops called 'Torter\u00edas'. This is also the area where most of Mexico's &lt;a href=\"haute%20cuisine\"&gt;haute cuisine&lt;/a&gt; can be found. There are eateries that specialize in pre-Hispanic food, including dishes with &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthern Mexico.\nThe foods eaten in what is now the north of Mexico have differed from those in the south since the pre-Hispanic era. Here, the indigenous people were hunter-gatherers with limited agriculture and settlements because of the arid land.\nWhen the Europeans arrived, they found much of the land in this area suitable for raising cattle, goats and sheep. This led to the dominance of meat, especially beef, in the region, and some of the most popular dishes include &lt;a href=\"machaca\"&gt;machaca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arrachera\"&gt;arrachera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cabrito\"&gt;cabrito&lt;/a&gt;. The region's distinctive cooking technique is grilling, as ranch culture has promoted outdoor cooking done by men.\nThe ranch culture has also prompted cheese production and the north produces the &lt;a href=\"Cheeses%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;widest varieties of cheese in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. These include &lt;a href=\"Queso%20blanco\"&gt;queso fresco&lt;/a&gt; (fresh farmer's cheese), ranchero (similar to Monterey Jack), &lt;a href=\"cuajada\"&gt;cuajada&lt;/a&gt; (a mildly sweet, creamy curd of fresh milk), &lt;a href=\"reques%C3%B3n\"&gt;reques\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; (similar to &lt;a href=\"cottage%20cheese\"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ricotta\"&gt;ricotta&lt;/a&gt;), Chihuahua's creamy semi-soft queso &lt;a href=\"Queso%20Chihuahua\"&gt;menonita&lt;/a&gt;, and fifty-six varieties of asadero (smoked cheese).\nAnother important aspect of northern cuisine is the presence of wheat, especially in the use of &lt;a href=\"flour\"&gt;flour&lt;/a&gt; tortillas. The area has at least forty different types of &lt;a href=\"flour%20tortillas\"&gt;flour tortillas&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason for this is that much of the land supports wheat production, introduced by the Spanish. These large tortillas allowed for the creation of burritos, usually filled with machaca in &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually gained popularity in the &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20United%20States\"&gt;Southwest United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe variety of foodstuffs in the north is not as varied as in the south of Mexico, because of the mostly desert climate. Much of the cuisine of this area is dependent on &lt;a href=\"food%20preservation\"&gt;food preservation&lt;/a&gt; techniques, namely dehydration and canning. Dried foods include meat, chiles, squash, &lt;a href=\"peas\"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt;, corn, &lt;a href=\"lentils\"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;, beans and &lt;a href=\"dried%20fruit\"&gt;dried fruit&lt;/a&gt;. A number of these are also canned. Preservation techniques change the flavor of foods; for example, many chiles are less hot after drying.\nIn Northeastern Mexico, during the Spanish colonial period, &lt;a href=\"Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n\"&gt;Nuevo Le\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; was founded and settled by Spanish families of Jewish origin (&lt;a href=\"Crypto-Jews\"&gt;Crypto-Jews&lt;/a&gt;). They contributed to the regional cuisine with dishes, such as Pan de Semita or \"Semitic Bread\" (a type of bread made without &lt;a href=\"leavening\"&gt;leavening&lt;/a&gt;), and cabrito or \"baby goat\", which is the typical food of Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, as well as some regions of &lt;a href=\"Coahuila\"&gt;Coahuila&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe north has seen waves of immigration by the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20immigration%20to%20Mexico\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mormon%20colonies%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;Mormons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mennonites%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;Mennonites&lt;/a&gt;, who have influenced the cuisines in areas, such as Chihuahua and &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California\"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, &lt;a href=\"Baja%20Med\"&gt;Baja Med&lt;/a&gt; cuisine has emerged in &lt;a href=\"Ensenada%2C%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Ensenada&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in Baja California, combining Mexican and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; flavors.\nOaxaca.\nThe cooking of &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca\"&gt;Oaxaca&lt;/a&gt; remained more intact after the conquest, as the Spanish took the area with less fighting and less disruption of the economy and food production systems. However, it was the first area to experience the mixing of foods and cooking styles, while central Mexico was still recuperating. Despite its size, the state has a wide variety of ecosystems and a wide variety of native foods. Vegetables are grown in the central valley, seafood is abundant on the coast and the area bordering Veracruz grows tropical fruits.\nMuch of the state's cooking is influenced by that of the &lt;a href=\"Mixtec%20people\"&gt;Mixtec&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser extent, the &lt;a href=\"Zapotec%20peoples\"&gt;Zapotec&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the colonial period, Oaxaca lost its position as a major food supplier and the area's cooking returned to a more indigenous style, keeping only a small number of foodstuffs, such as chicken and pork. It also adapted &lt;a href=\"mozzarella\"&gt;mozzarella&lt;/a&gt;, brought by the Spanish, and modified it to what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Oaxaca%20cheese\"&gt;Oaxaca cheese&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne major feature of Oaxacan cuisine is its seven &lt;a href=\"Mole%20sauce\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; varieties, second only to mole poblano in popularity. The seven are Negro (black), Amarillo (yellow), Coloradito (little red), Mancha Manteles (table cloth stainer), Chichilo (smoky stew), Rojo (red), and Verde (green).\nCorn is the staple food in the region. Tortillas are called blandas and are a part of every meal. Corn is also used to make empanadas, tamales and more. Black beans are favored, often served in soup or as a sauce for enfrijoladas. Oaxaca's regional chile peppers include &lt;a href=\"pasilla\"&gt;pasilla&lt;/a&gt; oaxaque\u00f1a (red, hot and smoky), along with amarillos (yellow), &lt;a href=\"chilhuacles\"&gt;chilhuacles&lt;/a&gt;, chilcostles and coste\u00f1os. These, along with herbs, such as hoja santa, give the food its unique taste.\nAnother important aspect of Oaxacan cuisine is &lt;a href=\"chocolate\"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, generally consumed as a beverage. It is frequently hand ground and combined with &lt;a href=\"almonds\"&gt;almonds&lt;/a&gt;, cinnamon and other ingredients.\nVeracruz.\nThe cuisine of &lt;a href=\"Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt; is a mix of indigenous, &lt;a href=\"Afro-Mexican\"&gt;Afro-Mexican&lt;/a&gt; and Spanish. The indigenous contribution is in the use of corn as a staple, as well as vanilla (native to the state) and herbs called acuyo and &lt;a href=\"hoja%20santa\"&gt;hoja santa&lt;/a&gt;. It is also supplemented by a wide variety of tropical fruits, such as &lt;a href=\"papaya\"&gt;papaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pouteria%20sapota\"&gt;mamey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zapote\"&gt;zapote&lt;/a&gt;, along with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"citrus%20fruit\"&gt;citrus fruit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pineapple\"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt; by the Spanish. The Spanish also introduced European herbs, such as &lt;a href=\"parsley\"&gt;parsley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thyme\"&gt;thyme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marjoram\"&gt;marjoram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bay%20laurel\"&gt;bay laurel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cilantro\"&gt;cilantro&lt;/a&gt; and others, which characterize much of the state's cooking. They are found in the best known dish of the region &lt;a href=\"Huachinango%20a%20la%20veracruzana\"&gt;Huachinango a la veracruzana&lt;/a&gt;, a red snapper dish.\nThe African influence is from the importation of &lt;a href=\"slaves\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, who brought foods with them, which had been introduced earlier to Africa by the &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;. As it borders the Gulf &lt;a href=\"coast\"&gt;coast&lt;/a&gt;, seafood figures prominently in most of the state. The state's role as a gateway to Mexico has meant that the dietary staple of corn is less evident than in other parts of Mexico, with rice as a heavy favorite. Corn dishes include &lt;a href=\"Garnaches\"&gt;garnachas&lt;/a&gt; (a kind of corn cake), which are readily available especially in the mountain areas, where indigenous influence is strongest.\nWestern Mexico.\nWest of Mexico City is the Pacific coast and the states of &lt;a href=\"Michoac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Michoac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jalisco\"&gt;Jalisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colima\"&gt;Colima&lt;/a&gt;. The cuisine of Michoacan is based on the &lt;a href=\"Pur%C3%A9pecha\"&gt;Purepecha&lt;/a&gt; culture which still dominates most of the state. The area has a large network of rivers and lakes providing &lt;a href=\"Fish%20as%20food\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. Its use of corn is perhaps the most varied. While &lt;a href=\"atole\"&gt;atole&lt;/a&gt; is drunk in most parts of Mexico, it is made with more different flavors in Michoac\u00e1n, including &lt;a href=\"blackberry\"&gt;blackberry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cascabel%20chili\"&gt;cascabel chili&lt;/a&gt; and more. Tamales come in different shapes, wrapped in corn husks. These include those folded into polyhedrons called &lt;a href=\"corunda\"&gt;corunda&lt;/a&gt;s and can vary in name if the filling is different. In the &lt;a href=\"Baj%C3%ADo\"&gt;Baj\u00edo&lt;/a&gt; area, tamales are often served with a meat &lt;a href=\"stew\"&gt;stew&lt;/a&gt; called , which is flavored with &lt;a href=\"Opuntia\"&gt;cactus fruit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main Spanish contributions to Michoac\u00e1n cuisine are rice, pork and spices. One of the best-known dishes from the state is &lt;a href=\"Morisqueta\"&gt;morisquesta&lt;/a&gt;, which is a sausage and rice dish, closely followed by carnitas, which is deep-fried (confit technique) pork. The latter can be found in many parts of Mexico, often claimed to be authentically Michoac\u00e1n. Other important ingredients in the cuisine include wheat (where bread symbolizes fertility) found in breads and &lt;a href=\"pastries\"&gt;pastries&lt;/a&gt;. Another is sugar, giving rise to a wide variety of desserts and sweets, such as &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20preserves\"&gt;fruit jellies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice%20cream\"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, mostly associated with the town of &lt;a href=\"Tocumbo%20Municipality\"&gt;Tocumbo&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Cotija%2C%20Michoac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Cotija&lt;/a&gt; has a cheese named after it. The local alcoholic beverage is &lt;a href=\"charanda\"&gt;charanda&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with fermented sugar cane.\nThe cuisine of the states of Jalisco and Colima is noted for dishes, such as birria, chilayo, &lt;a href=\"Menudo%20%28soup%29\"&gt;menudo&lt;/a&gt; and pork dishes. Jalisco's cuisine is known for tequila with the liquor produced only in certain areas allowed to use the name. The cultural and gastronomic center of the area is &lt;a href=\"Guadalajara\"&gt;Guadalajara&lt;/a&gt;, an area where both agriculture and cattle raising have thrived. The best-known dish from the area is &lt;a href=\"birria\"&gt;birria&lt;/a&gt;, a stew of goat, beef, mutton or pork with chiles and spices.\nAn important street food is &lt;a href=\"tortas%20ahogadas\"&gt;tortas ahogadas&lt;/a&gt;, where the torta (sandwich) is drowned in a chile sauce. Near Guadalajara is the town of &lt;a href=\"Tonal%C3%A1%2C%20Jalisco\"&gt;Tonal\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, known for its &lt;a href=\"pozole\"&gt;pozole&lt;/a&gt;, a hominy stew, reportedly said in the 16th century, to have been originally created with human flesh for ritual use. The area which makes tequila surrounds the city. A popular local drink is &lt;a href=\"tejuino\"&gt;tejuino&lt;/a&gt;, made from fermented corn. &lt;a href=\"Bionico\"&gt;Bionico&lt;/a&gt; is also a popular dessert in the Guadalajara area.\nOn the Pacific coast, seafood is common, generally cooked with European spices along with chile, and is often served with a spicy salsa. Favored fish varieties include &lt;a href=\"marlin\"&gt;marlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swordfish\"&gt;swordfish&lt;/a&gt;, snapper, &lt;a href=\"tuna\"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt;, shrimp and &lt;a href=\"octopus\"&gt;octopus&lt;/a&gt;. Tropical fruits are also important. The cuisine of the &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California%20Peninsula\"&gt;Baja California Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is especially heavy on seafood, with the widest variety. It also features a mild green chile pepper, as well as &lt;a href=\"Date%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;dates&lt;/a&gt;, especially in sweets.\nYucat\u00e1n.\nThe food of the &lt;a href=\"Yucat%C3%A1n%20peninsula\"&gt;Yucat\u00e1n peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is distinct from the rest of the country. It is based primarily on &lt;a href=\"Maya%20cuisine\"&gt;Mayan food&lt;/a&gt; with influences from the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20cuisine\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, Central Mexican, European (especially French) and &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20cuisine\"&gt;Middle Eastern&lt;/a&gt; cultures. As in other areas of Mexico, corn is the basic staple, as both a liquid and a solid food. One common way of consuming corn, especially by the poor, is a thin drink or gruel of white corn called by such names as &lt;a href=\"pozol\"&gt;pozol&lt;/a&gt; or keyem.\nOne of the main spices in the region is the annatto seed, called &lt;a href=\"achiote\"&gt;achiote&lt;/a&gt; in Spanish. It gives food a reddish color and a slightly peppery smell with a hint of nutmeg. Recados are seasoning pastes, based on achiote (&lt;a href=\"recado%20rojo\"&gt;recado rojo&lt;/a&gt;) or a mixture of &lt;a href=\"habanero\"&gt;habanero&lt;/a&gt; and chirmole both used on chicken and pork.\nRecado rojo is used for the area's best-known dish, &lt;a href=\"cochinita%20pibil\"&gt;cochinita pibil&lt;/a&gt;. Pibil refers to the cooking method (from the Mayan word \"&lt;a href=\"p%C3%ADib\"&gt;p\u00edib&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning \"buried\") in which foods are wrapped, generally in &lt;a href=\"banana%20leaves\"&gt;banana leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and cooked in a &lt;a href=\"Earth%20oven\"&gt;pit oven&lt;/a&gt;. Various meats are cooked this way. Habaneros are another distinctive ingredient, but they are generally served as (or part of) condiments on the side rather than integrated into the dishes.\nA prominent feature of Yucat\u00e1n cooking is the use of &lt;a href=\"bitter%20orange\"&gt;bitter orange&lt;/a&gt;s, which gives Yucat\u00e1n food the tangy element that characterizes it. Bitter orange is used as a seasoning for broth, to marinate meat and its juice (watered down with sugar) is used as a refreshing beverage.\n&lt;a href=\"Honey\"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt; was used long before the arrival of the Spanish to sweeten foods and to make a ritual alcoholic drink called &lt;a href=\"balch%C3%A9\"&gt;balch\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Today, a honey liquor called &lt;a href=\"Xtabentun%20%28liqueur%29\"&gt;xtabentun&lt;/a&gt; is still made and consumed in the region. The coastal areas feature several seafood dishes, based on fish like the &lt;a href=\"Grouper\"&gt;Mero&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of &lt;a href=\"Haemulidae\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cobia\"&gt;Esmedregal&lt;/a&gt;, which is fried and served with a spicy salsa based on the x'catic pepper and &lt;a href=\"achiote%20paste\"&gt;achiote paste&lt;/a&gt;. Other dishes include conch fillet (usually served raw, just marinated in lime juice), coconut flavored shrimp and lagoon snails.\nTraditionally, some dishes are served as &lt;a href=\"entr%C3%A9e\"&gt;entr\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the brazo de reina (a type of tamale made from &lt;a href=\"Chaya%20%28plant%29\"&gt;chaya&lt;/a&gt;) and papadzules (egg tacos seasoned in a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seed\"&gt;pumpkin seed&lt;/a&gt; gravy).\nStreet food in the area usually consists of Cochinita Pibil Tacos, &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"kibbeh\"&gt;kibbeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shawarma\"&gt;shawarma&lt;/a&gt; tacos, snacks made from hardened corn dough called piedras, and fruit-flavored ices.\n&lt;a href=\"Lime%20soup\"&gt;Lime soup&lt;/a&gt; made of chicken or some other meat such as pork or beef, lime juice and served with tortilla chips. Panucho made with a refried tortilla that is stuffed with refried black beans and topped with chopped cabbage, pulled chicken or turkey, tomato, pickled red onion, avocado, and pickled jalape\u00f1o pepper.\nMexican food outside Mexico.\nMexican cuisine is offered in a few fine restaurants in Europe and the United States. Sometimes &lt;a href=\"landrace\"&gt;landrace&lt;/a&gt; corn from Mexico is imported and ground on the premises.\nUnited States.\n&lt;a href=\"Mexican%20cuisine%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Mexican food in the United States&lt;/a&gt; is based on the food of &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hispanos\"&gt;Hispanos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southwestern United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Mexico\"&gt;Northern Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Mexican foods that originate in the United States often come from the Southwestern region, &lt;a href=\"breakfast%20burrito\"&gt;breakfast burrito&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico%20chile\"&gt;red or green chile&lt;/a&gt; come from &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexican%20cuisine\"&gt;New Mexican cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, likewise &lt;a href=\"chili%20con%20carne\"&gt;chili con carne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chimichanga\"&gt;chimichanga&lt;/a&gt;s are examples of &lt;a href=\"Tex-Mex\"&gt;Tex-Mex&lt;/a&gt;. With the growing ethnic &lt;a href=\"Mexican-American\"&gt;Mexican-American&lt;/a&gt; population in the United States, more authentic Mexican food is gradually appearing in the United States. Most large American cities host a Mexican diaspora due to proximity and immigration, and Mexican restaurants and food trucks are generally easy to find in the continental states. One reason is that Mexican immigrants use food as a means of combating homesickness, and for their descendants, it is a symbol of ethnicity. Alternatively, with more Americans experiencing Mexican food in Mexico, there is a growing demand for more authentic flavors. &lt;a href=\"Korean%20tacos\"&gt;Korean tacos&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href=\"Korean-Mexican%20fusion\"&gt;Korean-Mexican fusion&lt;/a&gt; dish popular in a number of urban areas in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Korean tacos originated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;."
