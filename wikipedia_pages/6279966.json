    "text": "A class president, also known as a class representative, is usually the leader of a &lt;a href=\"student%20body\"&gt;student body&lt;/a&gt; class, and presides over its class &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; or organization within a &lt;a href=\"student%20council\"&gt;student council&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=\"grade%20school\"&gt;grade school&lt;/a&gt;, class presidents are generally &lt;a href=\"elect\"&gt;elect&lt;/a&gt;ed by the class, a &lt;a href=\"constituency\"&gt;constituency&lt;/a&gt; composed of all &lt;a href=\"student\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"grade%20level\"&gt;grade level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe practice of electing a class president is common in many countries around the world.\nWhile a class president is similar to a &lt;a href=\"student%20government%20president\"&gt;student government president&lt;/a&gt; in certain ways, the main difference between the two positions is that a class president usually only represents a specific grade within the school while the student government president represents the school's entire student body (for which reason they are sometimes called \"student \"body\" president\" or \"\"school\" president\"). Studies have shown that &lt;a href=\"co-ed\"&gt;co-ed&lt;/a&gt; schools are more likely to have male students as class presidents than female students.\nDuties and term.\nThe primary duties of the class president usually include working with students to resolve problems, and informing school leaders and the student council of ideas emanating from the class. The president also has the responsibility of leading class cabinet meetings and organizing student activities and events. The &lt;a href=\"term%20of%20office\"&gt;term of office&lt;/a&gt; for a class president is one year in most schools. The student holding the office usually has the option of running again for the coming year. Also, the class president in some schools is in charge of building funds for the class to use for activities, such as &lt;a href=\"prom\"&gt;prom&lt;/a&gt;. Students in this position are also often looked to as token &lt;a href=\"student%20voice\"&gt;student voice&lt;/a&gt; representatives.\nSenior-class president.\nIn some schools, there is a senior-class president. The senior-class president is elected by popular vote and serves as the leader of the senior class in a high school or college. They are sometimes responsible for planning some of the events surrounding &lt;a href=\"graduation\"&gt;graduation&lt;/a&gt;. After graduation, the senior-class president is sometimes put in charge of planning &lt;a href=\"class%20reunion\"&gt;class reunion&lt;/a&gt;s in the years to come. In addition, being a class president is a position wherein one needs to be responsible inside the room. A class president will also develop leadership skills considering the daily task being given to them by the teachers and other persons. Standing in this position will emboss them as a yearning individual as well as a more &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aprominent\"&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt; and knowledgeable person over time. They can conduct the rules inside the class they are in and serve as the top eye of their fellow classmates to initiate an excellent environment throughout the year.\nPopular culture references.\nThe &lt;a href=\"stereotype\"&gt;stereotype&lt;/a&gt; of the class president has been &lt;a href=\"Typecasting%20%28acting%29\"&gt;typecast&lt;/a&gt; in books, movies and television. Typical &lt;a href=\"Plot%20%28narrative%29\"&gt;storylines&lt;/a&gt; sometimes contain a &lt;a href=\"nerd\"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"underdog%20%28competition%29\"&gt;underdog&lt;/a&gt; claiming the title from a more &lt;a href=\"Popularity\"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; student. The stereotype has also been used as a &lt;a href=\"political\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allegory\"&gt;allegory&lt;/a&gt; since the early 20th century, describing everyone from the &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;president of the United States&lt;/a&gt; to roles for &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; women in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fictional%20character\"&gt;Fictional character&lt;/a&gt;s in the role of class president have included:"
