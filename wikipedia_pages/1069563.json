    "text": "Lake Bogoria (formerly Lake Hannington) is a &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;saline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alkaline%20lake\"&gt;alkaline lake&lt;/a&gt; that lies in a &lt;a href=\"volcanic\"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; region in a half-&lt;a href=\"graben\"&gt;graben&lt;/a&gt; basin south of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Baringo\"&gt;Lake Baringo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, a little &lt;a href=\"north\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt;. Lake Bogoria, like &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Nakuru\"&gt;Lake Nakuru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elementeita\"&gt;Lake Elementeita&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Magadi\"&gt;Lake Magadi&lt;/a&gt; further south in the &lt;a href=\"Kenyan%20Rift%20Valley\"&gt;Rift Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Logipi\"&gt;Lake Logipi&lt;/a&gt; to the north, is home at times to one of the world's largest populations of &lt;a href=\"lesser%20flamingo\"&gt;lesser flamingo&lt;/a&gt;s. The lake is a &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar&lt;/a&gt; site and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Bogoria%20National%20Reserve\"&gt;Lake Bogoria National Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has been a protected National Reserve since November 29, 1973. Lake Bogoria is shallow (about 10 m depth), and is about 34\u00a0km long by 3.5\u00a0km wide, with a drainage basin of 700\u00a0km2. It is Located in Baringo County.\nLocal features include the Kesubo Swamp to the north and the Siracho Escarpment to the east, both within the National Reserve. The lake is also famous for &lt;a href=\"geyser\"&gt;geyser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt;s along the bank of the lake and in the lake. In four locations around the lake can be observed at least 10 geysers, which erupt up to 5 m high. Geyser activity is affected by the fluctuations of lake level, which may inundate or expose some geysers.\nChemistry and ecology.\nThe lake waters contain large concentrations of Na+, HCO3\u2212 and CO32\u2212 ions. They originate from inflow from the &lt;a href=\"Sandai%20River\"&gt;Sandai&lt;/a&gt; and Emsos rivers, and from about 200 alkaline hot springs that are present at three onshore sites: Loburu, Chemurkeu, and a southern group (Ng'wasis, Koibobei, Losaramat). Other springs discharge directly from the lake floor. Lake Bogoria also contains the highest concentration of true &lt;a href=\"geysers\"&gt;geysers&lt;/a&gt; in Africa (at least 18 are known). The lake waters are alkaline (&lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt;:10.5) and saline (up to 100 g/L total dissolved salts). The lake has no surface outlet so the water becomes saline mainly through evaporation, which is high in this semi-arid region. The lake itself is &lt;a href=\"meromictic\"&gt;meromictic&lt;/a&gt; (stratified) with less dense surface waters lying on a denser more saline bottom waters. Although hypersaline, the lake is highly productive with abundant &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Spirulina%20%28dietary%20supplement%29\"&gt;Arthrospira&lt;/a&gt; fusiformis) that feed the flamingoes, but few other organisms inhabit the lake e.g. the monogonont &lt;a href=\"rotifer\"&gt;rotifer&lt;/a&gt; species \"&lt;a href=\"Brachionus\"&gt;Brachionus&lt;/a&gt; sp. Austria\" (belonging to the \"&lt;a href=\"Brachionus%20plicatilis\"&gt;Brachionus plicatilis&lt;/a&gt;\" cryptic species complex) is found in high densities.\nThe lake has not always been saline. Sediment cores from the lake floor have shown that freshwater conditions existed for several periods during the past 10\u00a0000 years, and that lake level was up to 9 m higher than its present elevation of about 990 m. At times it might have overflowed northward towards &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Baringo\"&gt;Lake Baringo&lt;/a&gt;. At times, during the late &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; it might have been united with a larger precursor of modern Lake Baringo, but this is still uncertain.\nHistory.\nThe lake was formerly named after Bishop &lt;a href=\"James%20Hannington\"&gt;James Hannington&lt;/a&gt; who visited in 1885.\nThe lake area was the traditional home of the \"Endorois\" people, who were forced to leave the area in the 1970s and are now challenging their removal at the &lt;a href=\"African%20Commission%20on%20Human%20and%20Peoples%27%20Rights\"&gt;African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccommodations.\nHotel accommodation is available near Loboi village at the north end of the lake. Camping is permitted at the southern end of the lake (see North Lewis, 1998, for details)."
