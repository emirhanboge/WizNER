In modern times, its name in Greek was usually \u03a1\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 (Rizunda). Its Latin forms are Rhizus and Rhizaeum, the latter of which is used in the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;'s list of &lt;a href=\"titular%20see\"&gt;titular see&lt;/a&gt;s as the name of &lt;a href=\"bishopric\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt; of the town, which was once part of the late &lt;a href=\"Roman%20province\"&gt;Roman province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pontus%20Polemoniacus\"&gt;Pontus Polemoniacus&lt;/a&gt;). The name Rize is spelled in &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkish%20alphabet\"&gt;Ottoman Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;. The name in &lt;a href=\"Laz%20language\"&gt;Laz&lt;/a&gt; is Rizini (\u10e0\u10d8\u10d6\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8).\nHistory.\nThe first written mention of Rize is made by &lt;a href=\"Arrian\"&gt;Arrian&lt;/a&gt; in a work named &lt;a href=\"Periplus%20of%20the%20Euxine%20Sea\"&gt;Periplus of the Euxine Sea&lt;/a&gt;, as a city founded at the mouth of the homonymous river (the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; \u1ffe\u03a1\u03af\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2). \nDated at 130\u2013131AD and written as a letter to Roman Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hadrian\"&gt;Hadrian&lt;/a&gt;, the work records how its author, the governor of &lt;a href=\"Cappadocia\"&gt;Cappadocia&lt;/a&gt;, made an inspection tour of the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; territories that were part of his jurisdiction, first visiting the Roman Empire's Eastern &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;n frontier garrisons before pushing on to the Black Sea coast in the &lt;a href=\"Trabzon\"&gt;Trabzon&lt;/a&gt; (Trebizond) region.\nThe city of Rize formed part of historic Georgian province of Chaneti (). \nFrom 1547, Chaneti province was incorporated by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and became a part of the \"sancak\" of Lazistan. The city was claimed by the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; between 1918 and 1920. On the basis of the 1921 &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Kars\"&gt;Treaty of Kars&lt;/a&gt;, Soviet Russia granted Rize to Turkey just as the other territories of Artvin, Ardahan, and Hopa ().\nGeography.\nThe city is built around a small bay on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast, on a narrow strip of flat land between the sea and the mountains behind. The coastal strip is being expanded with landfill and the city is growing up the steep hillsides away from the coast. Rize enjoys a mild, extremely wet climate, vulnerable to storms coming off the Black Sea and therefore the surrounding countryside is rich with vegetation and is attracting more and more visitors every year.\nRize is a center for processing and shipping &lt;a href=\"Rize%20Tea\"&gt;Rize Tea&lt;/a&gt;, the tea grown in the surrounding area. Tea was introduced in the region in the 1940s and 1950s, changing the destiny of the region, which was desperately poor until then. The city has a tea research institute founded in 1958 and tea gardens are the main sight in the town's panoramic view. &lt;a href=\"Tea\"&gt;Tea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kiwifruit\"&gt;kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; plants are even planted in gardens around the town. The secondary activity is &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. Rize is linked by road with &lt;a href=\"Trabzon\"&gt;Trabzon&lt;/a&gt; (41\u00a0miles [66\u00a0km] west), &lt;a href=\"Hopa\"&gt;Hopa&lt;/a&gt; (55\u00a0miles [88\u00a0km] east on the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; border, and &lt;a href=\"Erzurum\"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt; (south). The nearest airport is in Trabzon.\nRize is a quiet town, a typical Turkish provincial capital with little in the way of night life or entertainment. However the border with Georgia has been open since the early 1990s, the Black Sea coast road has been widened and Rize is now wealthier than in previous decades; there are more cars in the streets, higher buildings on the sea front, and some places for young people to go are opening up now. The visitors to the surrounding countryside also contribute to the economy of the town.\nClimate.\nRize has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cfa\", Trewartha: \"Cf\"). However, as any mountainous region of Turkey, Rize is rich in climatic variety. The climate turns &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;continental&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dfb/Dc\") on the hillsides and &lt;a href=\"subarctic%20climate\"&gt;subarctic&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dfc/Eo\") on mountain slopes and &lt;a href=\"yaylak\"&gt;yaylas&lt;/a&gt;, a term used for highlands and highland plateaus in the region. \nThe city's climate is defined by mild temperate conditions, with warm summers, cool winters, heavy rainfall year-round and a maximum in late autumn (October to December). The city has low sunshine hours, lower than many stereotypically cloudy locations in Western Europe. Snowfall is occasional, and can be very heavy once it snows. The water temperature, typical for the Black Sea coast, is always never too warm or cold, fluctuating between throughout the year.\nEconomy and produce.\nHistorically, Rize grew &lt;a href=\"orange%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;s. However, weather destroyed the crops in the early 20th century, and the industry declined. The area also produced small amounts of &lt;a href=\"manganese\"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe economic structure of Rize is based primarily around its geographic location since it is a very mountainous city, making industrial development difficult and impractical. Given the lack of air and rail transit, most goods have to travel by truck or ship, which makes exporting and importing difficult. Rize's primary trading partner is &lt;a href=\"Trabzon\"&gt;Trabzon&lt;/a&gt;, the most developed city of northeast Black Sea region. Rize's main exports are agriculturally based; &lt;a href=\"Rize%20tea\"&gt;Rize tea&lt;/a&gt; and kiwifruit are among its most popular commodities.\nEducation.\nRize University was founded in 2006, and its name was changed to &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan%20University\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan University&lt;/a&gt; by the university senate's approval in 2011.\nCulture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rize%20Castle\"&gt;Rize Castle&lt;/a&gt;, a partly in ruins medieval castle is located in the southwest of the city center.\nSports.\nSports venues in Rize are &lt;a href=\"Rize%20Atat%C3%BCrk%20Stadium\"&gt;Rize Atat\u00fcrk Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yeni%20Rize%20%C5%9Eehir%20Stad%C4%B1\"&gt;Yeni Rize \u015eehir Stad\u0131&lt;/a&gt; and Rize Sports Complex consisting of &lt;a href=\"Rize%20Sports%20Hall\"&gt;Rize Sports Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Rize Indoor Swimming Pool.\nThe football team of &lt;a href=\"%C3%87aykur%20Rizespor\"&gt;\u00c7aykur Rizespor&lt;/a&gt; play in the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%BCper%20Lig\"&gt;S\u00fcper Lig&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pazarspor\"&gt;Pazarspor&lt;/a&gt; football team compete in the &lt;a href=\"TFF%20Third%20League\"&gt;TFF Third League&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n "
