    "text": "Gaura is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Onagraceae\"&gt;Onagraceae&lt;/a&gt;, native to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. The genus includes many species known commonly as beeblossoms. Recent genetic research has shown that the genus is &lt;a href=\"paraphyly\"&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/a&gt; unless the monotypic genus \"Stenosiphon\" is included within \"Gaura\", increasing the number of species in the genus to 22.\nThey are &lt;a href=\"annual%20plant\"&gt;annual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biennial%20plant\"&gt;biennial&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; plants; most are perennials with sturdy &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt;s, often forming dense thickets, crowding or shading out other plant species. They have a basal rosette of leaves, with erect or spreading flowering stems up to 2 m (rarely more) tall, leafy on the lower stem, branched and leafless on the upper stem. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s have four (rarely three) petals; they are &lt;a href=\"zygomorphic\"&gt;zygomorphic&lt;/a&gt;, with all the petals directed somewhat upwards. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is an indehiscent nut-like body containing reddish-brown &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s. It reproduces via seeds and also by rhizome growth.\nSeveral species of \"Gaura\" are regarded as &lt;a href=\"noxious%20weed\"&gt;noxious weed&lt;/a&gt;s, especially in disturbed or overgrazed areas where it easily takes hold. They can become a nuisance in situations involving disturbed habitat, such as trampled rangeland and clearings. Efforts to control \"Gaura\" focus mainly on prevention of misuse of land. There is no &lt;a href=\"biological%20pest%20control\"&gt;biological control&lt;/a&gt; method for plants of genus \"Gaura\", and removing existing infestations is difficult, due in large part to the plants' ability to reproduce from bits of rhizome left in the ground.\nDespite the poor reputation of plants of this genus, some species are cultivated as garden plants, such as \"G. lindheimeri\" (White Gaura).\nSynonymy.\nIn 2007, Warren L. Wagner, Peter C. Hoch, and Peter H. Raven published a \"Revised Classification of the Onagraceae\", which moved the bulk of the \"Gaura\" taxa into genus &lt;a href=\"Oenothera\"&gt;Oenothera&lt;/a&gt; sect. Gaura and made \"Gaura\" a synonym of \"Oenothera\". The following table shows where the \"Gaura\" taxa have been placed."
