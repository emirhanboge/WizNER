    "text": "Puscifer () is an American rock &lt;a href=\"supergroup%20%28music%29\"&gt;supergroup&lt;/a&gt; formed in Los Angeles by &lt;a href=\"Maynard%20James%20Keenan\"&gt;Maynard James Keenan&lt;/a&gt;, known as the lead singer of the bands &lt;a href=\"Tool%20%28band%29\"&gt;Tool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Perfect%20Circle\"&gt;A Perfect Circle&lt;/a&gt;. As Keenan was the only permanent member, he considered the project to be his \"creative subconscious\". Later, frequent collaborators Mat Mitchell and &lt;a href=\"Carina%20Round\"&gt;Carina Round&lt;/a&gt; have transitioned into permanent member roles.\nBackground.\nPuscifer's original name was Umlaut, \"a premiere improvisational hardcore band\". The name \"Puscifer\" was first publicized as a fictional band in the first episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Show\"&gt;Mr. Show&lt;/a&gt;\", including Keenan and &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Jones%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Adam Jones&lt;/a&gt; as members. Jones is not associated with Puscifer otherwise, although artwork by Jones has been featured on Puscifer apparel (the \"Your Mom's a Bitch\" shirt, specifically). Keenan describes Puscifer as \"simply a playground for the various voices in my head, [...] a space with no clear or discernible goals, [...] where my &lt;a href=\"Id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego\"&gt;Id, Ego&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anima%20%28Jung%29\"&gt;Anima&lt;/a&gt; all come together to exchange cookie recipes.\" Keenan also worked on &lt;a href=\"short%20film\"&gt;short film&lt;/a&gt;s with Ford Englerth and Jeffrey Brooks from Red Rock Entertainment Development; these shorts were done in a similar manner to that of \"Mr. Show\" and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Waits\"&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Big%20Time%20%28Tom%20Waits%20album%29\"&gt;Big Time&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPuscifer is \"as much a clothing line as it is a band\", with the clothing items produced in limited numbers. Keenan collaborated on a &lt;a href=\"leather%20jacket\"&gt;leather jacket&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Frank\"&gt;Paul Frank&lt;/a&gt;. On September 16, 2008, Keenan updated the puscifer.com blog, revealing that the first ever Puscifer store would be opening \"hopefully\" by October 1 in &lt;a href=\"Jerome%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona. Occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor, the store opened on October 3, 2008. In addition to the merchandise available on the band's online store, Keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee, art, and an ever-changing list of limited edition collectibles.\n\"Don't Shoot the Messenger\".\n\"Don't Shoot the Messenger\" is a four-track EP released by Puscifer on October 9, 2007.\n\"\"V\" Is for Vagina\".\nOn April 10, 2007, Keenan posted on the official website that a release would be aimed for mid-October.
