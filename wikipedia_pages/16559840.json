    "text": "Frances Kirkwood Crane (October 27, 1890 \u2013 November 6, 1981) was an American &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20fiction\"&gt;mystery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced private investigator Pat Abbott and his future wife Jean in her first novel, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Turquoise%20Shop\"&gt;The Turquoise Shop&lt;/a&gt;\" (1941). The Abbotts investigated crimes in a total of 26 volumes, each with a color in the title.\nLife and career.\nCrane was born in &lt;a href=\"Lawrenceville%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Lawrenceville, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and hailed from a wealthy, well-educated family; most of her male relatives were doctors, and her aunt Nancy may have earned a &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's degree&lt;/a&gt;, highly unusual for a woman of that time. Some biographies mistakenly list her birth year as 1896. Crane herself was a &lt;a href=\"Phi%20Beta%20Kappa\"&gt;Phi Beta Kappa&lt;/a&gt; graduate of the University of Illinois, and she did graduate study at the University of Chicago.\nHer husband was the wealthy advertising executive Ned Crane, and throughout their marriage Frances regularly published articles in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Yorker\"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;\", where she became known for her dry, sophisticated sense of humour. She had an extended stay in Germany towards the end of the 1930s, but her &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; opinions and outspokenness soon put her at odds with the rising tide of &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt;; she was once reprimanded after thumbing her nose at a speech by &lt;a href=\"Hitler\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; being broadcast over loudspeakers, and on another occasion tried convincing the staff at an &lt;a href=\"anti-Semitic\"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; restaurant that she was &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; (her family were in fact descended from Scottish &lt;a href=\"Presbyterianism\"&gt;Presbyterians&lt;/a&gt;). She was expelled from Germany following the arrest of her Jewish housekeeper and the woman's son, supposedly for 'crimes against the state', and Frances's subsequent furious articles decrying the Nazi regime.\nAfter leaving behind &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, having been recently divorced and faced with mounting &lt;a href=\"college\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; bills from her only daughter, Nancy, Frances began formulating detective stories, upon realising that her old fiction \u2013 gentle &lt;a href=\"satire\"&gt;satire&lt;/a&gt;s of English culture \u2013 were going out of fashion among modern American readers, who were now supporting the British in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Nancy herself was a &lt;a href=\"sculptor\"&gt;sculptor&lt;/a&gt; and also wrote articles of her own in the late 1940s; she was married to the &lt;a href=\"pulp%20magazine\"&gt;pulp magazine&lt;/a&gt; writer Norbert Davis until his &lt;a href=\"suicide\"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;, possibly as a result of his &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis, and had one daughter, Diana Farris. Frances published no novels in 1949 because of Nancy's near fatal car accident; she crashed the same vehicle her husband gassed himself in, and was left facially mutilated for several months afterwards. Amazingly she had another child, Cynthia, soon after the incident.\nFrances published her first crime novel, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Turquoise%20Shop\"&gt;The Turquoise Shop&lt;/a&gt;\", in 1941, after hearing about a real-life incident in a jeweller's shop, and subsequently produced 25 more mystery novels, taking early retirement by 1968. She died in an &lt;a href=\"Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Albuquerque, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; nursing home, where she had spent the previous few months because of ill-health. Her ashes were scattered across her home town of Lawrenceville.\nRadio.\nFrom 1945 to 1947, the radio series, \"&lt;a href=\"Abbott%20Mysteries\"&gt;Abbott Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;\", was based on Crane's characters. Between 1954 and 1955, the radio program \"Adventures of the Abbotts\" starred &lt;a href=\"Claudia%20Morgan\"&gt;Claudia Morgan&lt;/a&gt; and Don Briggs (followed by &lt;a href=\"Les%20Damon\"&gt;Les Damon&lt;/a&gt; and Mandel Kramer) as the husband-and-wife crimefighters."
