    "text": "Wadjmose was an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian prince of the &lt;a href=\"Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;18th Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;; a son of Pharaoh &lt;a href=\"Thutmose%20I\"&gt;Thutmose I&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHe is likely to have been born a few years before his father ascended the throne. He had a brother named &lt;a href=\"Amenmose%20%28prince%29\"&gt;Amenmose&lt;/a&gt;; it is disputed who their mother was. If they were born to Queen &lt;a href=\"Ahmose%20%28queen%29\"&gt;Ahmose&lt;/a&gt;, they were full brothers of &lt;a href=\"Hatshepsut\"&gt;Hatshepsut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefrubity\"&gt;Nefrubity&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, Wadjmose may have been the son of Queen Mutnofret and thus a full brother of &lt;a href=\"Thutmose%20II\"&gt;Thutmose II&lt;/a&gt;.\nWadjmose is depicted in the &lt;a href=\"El%20Kab\"&gt;El Kab&lt;/a&gt; tomb of himself and Amenmose's tutor , as sitting on Paheri's lap. He is thought to have predeceased his father. Wadjmose and another prince named Ramose were mentioned in the Theban funerary chapel of &lt;a href=\"Thutmose%20I\"&gt;Thutmose I&lt;/a&gt; where Queen &lt;a href=\"Mutnofret\"&gt;Mutnofret&lt;/a&gt; is also included. This chapel may have been erected during the reign of Thutmose II between the places where later the mortuary temple of &lt;a href=\"Thutmose%20IV\"&gt;Thutmose IV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ramesseum\"&gt;Ramesseum&lt;/a&gt; were built. A statue of Mutnofret was found here, making it likely that she was his mother.\nWadjmose's name occurs written in a &lt;a href=\"cartouche\"&gt;cartouche&lt;/a&gt;, which is quite rare for princes."
