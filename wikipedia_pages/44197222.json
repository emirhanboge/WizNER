    "text": "The Tempio Canoviano or Temple of Canova is a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; parish church built in a severe &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt; style, based on the designs of &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Canova\"&gt;Antonio Canova&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on a hilltop in &lt;a href=\"Possagno\"&gt;Possagno&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Treviso\"&gt;Province of Treviso&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Veneto\"&gt;Veneto&lt;/a&gt;.\nWork on the temple, that is dedicated to the Holy Trinity begun in 1819 and resumed after Canova's death in 1822 until 1830 under the supervision of abbot Giovanni Battista Sartori and architect &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Segusini\"&gt;Giuseppe Segusini&lt;/a&gt;. The project underwent several modifications by Pietro Bosio and Giovanni Zardo along with &lt;a href=\"Giannantonio%20Selva\"&gt;Giannantonio Selva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Rossini\"&gt;Luigi Rossini&lt;/a&gt;. The structure recalls the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Pantheon of Rome&lt;/a&gt;. Canova almost single-handedly financed the site since he wished to be buried there after his request of a burial at the Rome Pantheon was denied. Upon completion in 1830 his remains were transferred to the church.\nThe atrium or &lt;a href=\"pronaos\"&gt;pronaos&lt;/a&gt; is nearly in size, the diameter of the interior and height of the cupola, and contains 16 &lt;a href=\"doric%20columns\"&gt;doric columns&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"architrave\"&gt;architrave&lt;/a&gt; bears the Latin inscription: \"DEO OPT MAX UNI AV TRINO\" (Temple dedicated to the Optimal God, one and three). The &lt;a href=\"metope%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;metope&lt;/a&gt;s were carved by pupils from stucco casts of Canova.\nThe altars contain canvases from shuttered churches and monasteries including by &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Giordano\"&gt;Luca Giordano&lt;/a&gt; (St Francis of Paola); &lt;a href=\"Palma%20il%20Giovane\"&gt;Palma il Giovane&lt;/a&gt; (Jesus in Gesthemane); Giovanni de Sacchis called &lt;a href=\"il%20Pordenone\"&gt;il Pordenone&lt;/a&gt; (Madonna of the Mercies); and &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Vicentino\"&gt;Andrea Vicentino&lt;/a&gt; (Saints Sebastian; Francis of Assisi, Roch, Anthony with the Madonna and child and a glory of angels). The bronze sculpture of the \"Piet\u00e0\" was completed by &lt;a href=\"Bartolomeo%20Ferrari\"&gt;Bartolomeo Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, based on models by Canova. Above the altar is a \"Deposition\" painted by Canova."
