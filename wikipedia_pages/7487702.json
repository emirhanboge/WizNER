    "text": "Helen Dortch Longstreet (, Dortch; April 20, 1863 \u2013 May 3, 1962), known as the \"Fighting Lady\", was an American social advocate, librarian, and newspaper woman serving as reporter, editor, publisher, and business manager. She was the first woman who tried to secure a public office in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;the state of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. She was the second wife of &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20Longstreet\"&gt;James Longstreet&lt;/a&gt;. She earned her nickname from being a champion of causes such as preservation of the environment and civil rights. She is also remembered for her work as a Confederate memorialist and postmistress. In Governor &lt;a href=\"William%20Yates%20Atkinson\"&gt;William Yates Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;'s first campaign, she rendered him valuable service by her vigorous editorials. Her stirring fight to have women made eligible to the position of State Librarian was the first successful movement in the State of Georgia toward breaking down the prejudice against women holding high political positions. Dortch Longstreet was the proprietor and editor of two weeklies, Vice-President of the Georgia Weekly Press Association, Secretary of the Woman's Press Club of Georgia, and Assistant Librarian of the State of Georgia. She was also the leader of the movement to have the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; opened to women, was an advocate of modern industrial education, and took interest in the advancement of the women of her State and country. She died in 1962.\nEarly life and education.\nHelen (&lt;a href=\"nickname\"&gt;nickname&lt;/a&gt;, \"Ellen\") Dortch was born in &lt;a href=\"Carnesville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Carnesville, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, on April 20, 1863. She descended from an old &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; family notable in the political and war history of that State. Her father, James Speed Dortch (died August 1891) was a lawyer in the northeast part of the state and, also edited the \"Carnesville Tribune\". She was the only daughter and was the idol of his heart. He directed her education and she grew up as his friend and companion, and was as much at home with law books as in literature.\nShe attended Gainesville Seminary (now &lt;a href=\"Brenau%20University\"&gt;Brenau University&lt;/a&gt;) for a year. In 1885, she was back at home and began publishing the \"Tribune\", while the father remained as editor. She returned to school 1887\u201389, studying at &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20of%20Maryland%20University\"&gt;Notre Dame of Maryland University&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nDortch became the owner and editor of the Carnesville, Georgia, \"Tribune\" in 1888, when the establishment consisted of 150 pounds of long primer type, mostly in \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Api%23English%3A%20metal%20typesetting\"&gt;pi&lt;/a&gt;\", a few cases of worn adverting type and a subscription book whose credit column had been conscientiously neglected. She replaced them with new and improved ones, and the circulation of the paper increased to thousands. She had been typist, editor and business manager, and had solicited and canvassed the district for subscribers, because she was not able to hire any one to do it for her. Beginning the work at the age of 17, she fought the boycotters and Alliance opponents and overcome the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; prejudice against women using their intelligence in the business world. After working for two years, she went to &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, where she studied for two years in the Notre Dame school. She resumed her work on the \"Tribune\" in June, 1890.\nIn October 1894, it was announced that Dortch, editor at that time of the &lt;a href=\"Milledgeville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Milledgeville&lt;/a&gt; \"Chronicle\", was to become the private secretary of Governor Atkinson. This office carried with it a major's commission in the state militia.\nShe was the first woman in Georgia to serve as Assistant State Librarian in 1894. She also authored the \"Dortch Bill\" (which became law in 1896) to allow a woman to hold the office of State Librarian.\n1897 and later.\nHaving met General James Longstreet, through her school roommate, she married him on September 8, 1897, when she was just 34 and he was 76. She was widowed in 1904, childless.\nBefore and after becoming a widow, Longstreet devoted much time to ensure that General Longstreet was accurately portrayed by history. In 1905, she documented her husband's account of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; by publishing the book \"Lee and Longstreet at High Tide\". Another important cause that she took up about 1911 was the creation of a state park at &lt;a href=\"Tallulah%20Gorge\"&gt;Tallulah Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Dortch Longstreet was opposed to a plan by &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Power\"&gt;Georgia Power&lt;/a&gt; to build a series of &lt;a href=\"hydroelectric%20dam\"&gt;hydroelectric dam&lt;/a&gt;s along the original course of the &lt;a href=\"Tallulah%20River\"&gt;Tallulah River&lt;/a&gt; and particularly concerned about the potential impact on the Tallulah Gorge. Although unsuccessful, her campaign was one of the first &lt;a href=\"conservation%20movement\"&gt;conservation movement&lt;/a&gt;s in Georgia.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she was a &lt;a href=\"Rosie%20the%20Riveter\"&gt;Rosie the Riveter&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Aircraft\"&gt;Bell Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; plant in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;. She said, \"I was at the head of my class in riveting school. In fact I was the only one in it.\"\nLongstreet was also politically active. She became a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Progressive%20Party%20of%201912\"&gt;Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; and supported &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; when he lost the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; nomination to &lt;a href=\"William%20Howard%20Taft\"&gt;Taft&lt;/a&gt; in 1912. In fact, she was a delegate to the Progressive Party convention in 1912. She ran an unsuccessful write-in campaign for governor of Georgia against &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Talmadge\"&gt;Herman Talmadge&lt;/a&gt; in 1950.\nShe received a number of honors. In 1947, she became the first woman to have her portrait placed in the State Capitol. When the &lt;a href=\"Tallulah%20Gorge%20State%20Park\"&gt;Tallulah Gorge State Park&lt;/a&gt; was finally created in 1993, it was done in her honor and the trails in the park were named the Helen Dortch Longstreet Trail System in 1999. Dortch Longstreet was inducted in the Georgia Women of Achievement in 2004 according to GWA files."
