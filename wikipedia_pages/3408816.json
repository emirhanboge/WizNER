    "text": "Boot Hill is a &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt;-themed &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20game\"&gt;role-playing game&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Blume\"&gt;Brian Blume&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Gygax\"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Don%20Kaye\"&gt;Don Kaye&lt;/a&gt; (although Kaye unexpectedly died before the game was published), and first published in 1975. \"Boot Hill\" was &lt;a href=\"TSR%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;TSR&lt;/a&gt;'s third role-playing game, appearing not long after \"&lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20the%20Petal%20Throne\"&gt;Empire of the Petal Throne&lt;/a&gt;\", and taking its name from \"&lt;a href=\"Boot%20Hill\"&gt;Boot Hill&lt;/a&gt;\", the popular &lt;a href=\"Wild%20West\"&gt;Wild West&lt;/a&gt; term for \"cemetery\". \"Boot Hill\" was marketed to take advantage of America's love of the western genre. The game did feature some new game mechanics, such as the use of percentile dice, but its focus on gunfighting rather than role-playing, as well as the lethal nature of its combat system, limited its appeal. \"Boot Hill\" was issued in three editions over 15 years, but it never reached the same level of popularity as \"D&amp;D\" and other fantasy-themed role-playing games.\nCreative origins.\nSoon after TSR was formed by &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Gygax\"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Don%20Kaye\"&gt;Don Kaye&lt;/a&gt; in late 1973, they and new business partner &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Blume\"&gt;Brian Blume&lt;/a&gt; started development of the rules for a Western genre miniatures combat system and role-playing game called \"Boot Hill\". Kaye in particular was an avid supporter of \"Boot Hill\"\u2014he was a fan of the Western genre, and even his fantasy \"D&amp;D\" character, &lt;a href=\"Murlynd\"&gt;Murlynd&lt;/a&gt;, was dressed and armed as a cowboy after being magically transported from Gygax's &lt;a href=\"Greyhawk\"&gt;Greyhawk&lt;/a&gt; campaign to an alternate universe set in the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20West\"&gt;Wild West&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack in January 1975. Blume and Gygax subsequently published \"Boot Hill\" later that year in memory of their friend. It was TSR's third role-playing game, after \"&lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20and%20Dragons\"&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20the%20Petal%20Throne\"&gt;Empire of the Petal Throne&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"David%20M.%20Ewalt\"&gt;David M. Ewalt&lt;/a&gt;, in his book \"Of Dice and Men\", described the game as \"the company's second role-playing game; it was set in the Old West and focused mostly on gun-fighting.\"\nSystem.\n\"Boot Hill\" used game mechanics that were advanced for the time. Most games still used traditional six-sided dice, but \"Boot Hill\" was one of the first games to use two &lt;a href=\"ten-sided%20dice\"&gt;ten-sided dice&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"percentile%20die\"&gt;percentile dice&lt;/a&gt; for character abilities and skill resolution. However, several factors limited its appeal.\nFor these reasons, although \"Boot Hill\" was published in three editions, none captured the public imagination in the same way as \"D&amp;D\"; \"Boot Hill\" remained a very small and limited member of TSR's stable of games.\nPublications.\n\"Boot Hill, 2nd Edition\" was supported by a referee's &lt;a href=\"Gamemaster%27s%20screen\"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; and five 32 page &lt;a href=\"adventure%20%28role-playing%20games%29\"&gt;adventure modules&lt;/a&gt;:\nTSR also released a three-figure pack of gunslinger &lt;a href=\"Miniature%20figure%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;miniatures&lt;/a&gt; for \"Boot Hill\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Dragon Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" issue 71 features the Boot Hill module \"The Taming of Brimstone\" by Donald Mumma which was the winner of a module design contest.\nReception.\nIn the December\u2013January 1979 edition of \"&lt;a href=\"White%20Dwarf%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;White Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;\", Dominic Beddow reviewed the second (boxed) edition of \"Boot Hill\", and gave it an above average score of 8 out of 10. He found few substantive rule changes from the first edition, other than the addition of several appendices to the rulebook that included biographies of notable American gunfighters, suggested scenarios, and a method for transferring characters to and from other TSR roleplaying systems such as \"&lt;a href=\"D%26amp%3BD\"&gt;D&amp;D&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20Alpha\"&gt;Metamorphosis Alpha&lt;/a&gt;\". Beddow was not impressed by the campaign map, which was \"by TSR standards, extremely shabby and unprofessional\", with large blank areas that \"with their generally lazy attitude towards the map, TSR asks you to fill in numerous details, claiming this 'creates flexibility.'\" However, he found the large scale map of a generic Western town to be \"quite commendable\". Overall, Beddow concluded that \"Boot Hill\" is such an \"Easy yet effective game to play\" because of \"the knowledge of, and feeling for, the Wild West which is within all of us. It is fantasy and yet one still has one's feet on the ground.\"\nOther recognition.\nA copy of the \"Boot Hill\" module \"Mad Mesa\" is held in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Strong%20National%20Museum%20of%20Play\"&gt;Strong National Museum of Play&lt;/a&gt; (object 110.1979)."
