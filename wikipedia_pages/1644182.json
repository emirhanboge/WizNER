Gizmo created a corporation which supplied technology to various people, including criminals. Hoping to increase his wealth, Gizmo joined the Fearsome Five through an &lt;a href=\"advertisement\"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; placed in the \"Underworld Star\", a criminal underground newsletter, by the psychopathic criminal &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Light%20%28Arthur%20Light%29\"&gt;Doctor Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a number of unsuccessful conflicts with the Teen Titans (and &lt;a href=\"Superman\"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Adventures%20of%20Superman%20%28comic%20book%29\"&gt;The Adventures of Superman&lt;/a&gt;\" #430) Gizmo went straight for a while, and took a job at &lt;a href=\"S.T.A.R.%20Labs\"&gt;S.T.A.R. Labs&lt;/a&gt;, until his former Fearsome Five teammate &lt;a href=\"Psimon\"&gt;Psimon&lt;/a&gt;, after having been seemingly killed by his teammates, resurfaced looking for revenge, and shrank Gizmo to microscopic size. Years later, Gizmo found a way to revert to his normal size, and took up a life of crime once again, partnering with his former teammate, &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a storyline in \"&lt;a href=\"Outsiders%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Outsiders&lt;/a&gt;\" (vol. 3) #12\u201315 (July\u2013October 2004), frequent &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Marvel%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/a&gt; archenemy &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Sivana\"&gt;Doctor Sivana&lt;/a&gt; gathered Gizmo and the others, and put the team to work for him in a scheme to &lt;a href=\"short%20%28finance%29\"&gt;short sell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LexCorp\"&gt;LexCorp&lt;/a&gt; stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in &lt;a href=\"Metropolis%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;, and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building, and destroying two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a &lt;a href=\"integrated%20circuit\"&gt;microchip&lt;/a&gt; processor factory of Lexcorp's &lt;a href=\"subsidiary\"&gt;subsidiary&lt;/a&gt;, Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Outsiders%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Outsiders&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's nuclear missile facility near &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Tree%2C%20California\"&gt;Joshua Tree, California&lt;/a&gt;. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. Sivana used the money he made from the scheme to purchase a tropical island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; to use as his lair, and the remaining members of the Five were defeated in their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at Canada.\nGizmo appeared in undead form, summoned by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Blood\"&gt;Brother Blood&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Teen Titans from freeing &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Eternity\"&gt;Kid Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, in \"Teen Titans\" (vol. 3) #31 (2006). In \"&lt;a href=\"Birds%20of%20Prey%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/a&gt;\" #120-121 (2008), Gizmo was reanimated by the geniuses at Macintech Research &amp; Development, a technology company located in &lt;a href=\"Platinum%20Flats\"&gt;Platinum Flats&lt;/a&gt;. He disposed of their C.E.O and earned his seat on the Silicon Syndicate, a sinister group of high-tech criminals. Gizmo retained most of his brain function, but is still missing his eye and is partially decomposed.\nO'Jeneus.\nIn \"DC Special: Cyborg\" issue #5 a new Gizmo debuted who is the son of the first Gizmo. He is based visually on the animated Gizmo. After graduating from the villainous &lt;a href=\"H.I.V.E.\"&gt;H.I.V.E Academy&lt;/a&gt;, the diminutive teen followed in his father's footsteps and became the second Gizmo, a high-tech super-thief. He battles &lt;a href=\"Cyborg%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt; as a member of Mr. Orr's \"Cyborg Revenge Squad\".\nThe New 52.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20New%2052\"&gt;The New 52&lt;/a&gt; timeline, a version of Gizmo first appears a member of the &lt;a href=\"Fearsome%20Five\"&gt;Fearsome Five&lt;/a&gt;. The group appears with the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Society%20of%20Super%20Villains\"&gt;Secret Society&lt;/a&gt;, which is allied with the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20Syndicate%20of%20America\"&gt;Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. He is sent with the other members of the Fearsome Five, along with &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Psycho\"&gt;Doctor Psycho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Hammond\"&gt;Hector Hammond&lt;/a&gt;, on a mission in which he is defeated by &lt;a href=\"Cyborg%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Men\"&gt;Metal Men&lt;/a&gt;.\nDC Rebirth.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"DC%20Rebirth\"&gt;DC Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;\", Gizmo appeared as part of the Fearsome Five.\nAnother using the name, Brendan Li, known as Giz, is a friend of &lt;a href=\"Nightwing\"&gt;Nightwing&lt;/a&gt;. He is a former villain, dating Mouse, who is a former apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Catwoman\"&gt;Catwoman&lt;/a&gt;. He attends the community center in &lt;a href=\"Bludhaven\"&gt;Bludhaven&lt;/a&gt; run by Defacer and Jimmy Nice, as part of the support group of Nightwing. He is killed doing a favor for Nightwing attempting to hack into a gauntlet from Spyral, which activates defenses and electrocutes him.\nPowers and abilities.\nGizmo is capable of creating unbelievable weaponry by transforming one machine into another. In his tiny hands using state-of-the-art technology, something like an ordinary vacuum cleaner can easily be converted into a deadly, unstoppable tank."
