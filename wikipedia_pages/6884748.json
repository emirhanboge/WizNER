Parkmont was founded in 1972, by a parent group in &lt;a href=\"McLean%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;McLean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as a cooperative &lt;a href=\"middle%20school\"&gt;middle school&lt;/a&gt;. Parkmont was designed for parents looking for &lt;a href=\"alternative%20education\"&gt;alternative education&lt;/a&gt; for their child. The school uses more of a hands-on, individual, and dynamic approach than more traditional schools. Parkmont is non-sectarian and an &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Independent%20Maryland%20and%20DC%20Schools\"&gt;Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools&lt;/a&gt; accredited school.\nHistory.\nParkmont was founded in 1972, as a &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; parent-run middle school and became a board-operated &lt;a href=\"501%28c%29%283%29%20organization\"&gt;501(c)(3)&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. The school derived its name from the Parkway Program (Park) and the philosophy of &lt;a href=\"Montessori%20education\"&gt;Montessori education&lt;/a&gt; (mont).\nUntil 1977, Parkmont School was located at 16670 Chain Bridge Road in McLean, Virginia. With the help of a $100,000 &lt;a href=\"Grant%20%28money%29\"&gt;grant&lt;/a&gt;, the school was able to relocate to Washington, D.C., to take better advantage of the educational opportunities available in the city. \nIn the spring of 1991, Parkmont School merged with Somerset School and moved to its current home.\nParkmont teaching method.\nThe Parkmont School's approach, in the unique way they're educating their students, can be found in their &lt;a href=\"mission%20statement\"&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;:\nThis broad use of educating students can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Montessori%20education\"&gt;Montessori&lt;/a&gt; Philosophy, founded by the progressive educator, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Montessori\"&gt;Maria Montessori&lt;/a&gt; (1870-1952). The Montessori philosophy is based on \"supporting the complete development of the child as they progress from birth to adulthood. It takes the broad vision of education as an aid for life.\"\nOne of Montessori's many accomplishments was the &lt;a href=\"Montessori%20method\"&gt;Montessori method&lt;/a&gt;. This is a method of education for young children that stresses the development of a child's initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding of child development.\nAdministration.\n, the head of school is Ron McClain since 1981.\nHead of School: Ron McClain\nDean of Students: Nijole Gedutis\nSchool Administrator: Willa Reinhard\nCommunications Director: Erin Lidz\nOffice Administrator: Zoe McLean\nOffice Administrator: Mel Kates\nDirector of Admissions: Meara Glover\nPoetry Festival Coordinator: Kim Scharf\nTechnology Coordinator: Sam Graul\nMiddle School Advisor: Matt McClain\nMiddle School Advisor: Winnie Shi\nUpper School Advisor: Ethan Kuhnhenn\nUpper School Advisor: Anthony Muehlberger\nUpper School Advisor: Bridget Mullins\nUpper School Advisor: Sania Tildon"
