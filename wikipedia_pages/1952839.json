    "text": "Team B was a &lt;a href=\"Competitor%20analysis\"&gt;competitive analysis&lt;/a&gt; exercise commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) to analyze threats the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; posed to the security of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It was created, in part, due to a 1974 publication by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Wohlstetter\"&gt;Albert Wohlstetter&lt;/a&gt;, who accused the CIA of chronically underestimating Soviet military capability. Years of &lt;a href=\"National%20Intelligence%20Estimate\"&gt;National Intelligence Estimate&lt;/a&gt;s (NIE) that were later demonstrated to be very wrong were another motivating factor.\nPresident &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Ford\"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; began the Team B project in May 1976, inviting a group of outside experts to evaluate classified intelligence on the Soviet Union. Team B, approved by then-&lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20Central%20Intelligence\"&gt;Director of Central Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, was composed of \"outside experts\" who attempted to counter the arguments of intelligence officials within the CIA. The intelligence community was in the process of putting together its own assessment at the same time.\nTeam B concluded that the NIE on the Soviet Union, compiled and produced annually by the CIA, chronically underestimated Soviet military power and misinterpreted Soviet strategic intentions. Its findings were leaked to the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20media\"&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; shortly after &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Carter\"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;'s 1976 &lt;a href=\"1976%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential election win&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to appeal to staunch anticommunists in both parties and also not to appear partisan. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of \"the &lt;a href=\"window%20of%20vulnerability\"&gt;window of vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;\" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Carter%23Administration%20and%20cabinet\"&gt;Carter administration&lt;/a&gt; and accelerated under &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome scholars and policy-makers, including &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Hessing%20Cahn\"&gt;Anne Hessing Cahn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Control%20and%20Disarmament%20Agency\"&gt;Arms Control and Disarmament Agency&lt;/a&gt;, later criticized the Team B project's findings. Many of these experts argued that the findings were grossly inaccurate.\nCreation.\nA number of conservative foreign policy intellectuals worried that the U.S. was sacrificing strategic position in the early 1970s by embracing &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9tente\"&gt;d\u00e9tente&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Wohlstetter\"&gt;Albert Wohlstetter&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, accused the CIA of systematically underestimating Soviet missile deployment in his 1974 \"&lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Policy\"&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/a&gt;\" article, \"Is There a Strategic Arms Race?\" Wohlstetter concluded that the United States was allowing the Soviet Union to achieve military superiority by not closing a perceived &lt;a href=\"missile%20gap\"&gt;missile gap&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;s then began concerted attacks on the CIA's annual assessment of the Soviet threat.\nPresident Ford's Chief of Staff &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Rumsfeld\"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; started making speeches arguing that the Soviets were ignoring &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State\"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Kissinger\"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;'s treaties and secretly building up their weapons so that they could eventually attack the United States. Rumsfeld used his influence to persuade Ford to set up an independent inquiry. Rumsfeld and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wolfowitz\"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt; wanted to create a much less charitable picture of the Soviet Union, its intentions, and its views about fighting and winning a nuclear war. The organization chosen by the Ford administration to challenge the CIA's analysis was the &lt;a href=\"President%27s%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Advisory%20Board\"&gt;President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; (PFIAB).\nIn 1975, PFIAB members asked CIA Director &lt;a href=\"William%20Colby\"&gt;William Colby&lt;/a&gt; to approve a project that would result in comparative assessments of the Soviet threat. Colby refused, stating it was hard \"to envisage how an ad hoc independent group of analysts could prepare a more thorough, comprehensive assessment of Soviet strategic capabilities than could the intelligence community.\" Colby was removed from his position in the November 1975 &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Massacre\"&gt;Halloween Massacre&lt;/a&gt;; Ford has stated that he had made the decision alone, but the historiography of the \"Halloween Massacre\" appears to support the allegations that Rumsfeld had successfully lobbied for this.\nWhen George H. W. Bush became the Director of Central Intelligence in 1976, the PFIAB renewed its request for comparative &lt;a href=\"threat%20assessment\"&gt;threat assessment&lt;/a&gt;s. Although his top analysts argued against such an undertaking, Bush checked with the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, obtained a go-ahead, and by May 26 had signed off on the experiment. A team of 16 \"outside experts\" were to take an independent look at highly classified data used by the intelligence community to assess Soviet strategic forces in the yearly National Intelligence Estimates.\nThere were three teams: \nIt was the third team, chaired by &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; professor &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Pipes\"&gt;Richard Pipes&lt;/a&gt;, that ultimately received the most publicity. It is now referred to as Team B.\nMembers.\nPFIAB's Team B was headed by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Pipes\"&gt;Richard Pipes&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard historian and specialist in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian history&lt;/a&gt;. Team B's members included &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20O.%20Graham\"&gt;Daniel O. Graham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Wolf%20%28Team%20B%29\"&gt;Thomas Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Vogt\"&gt;John Vogt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"William%20Van%20Cleave\"&gt;William Van Cleave&lt;/a&gt;. Advisers included &lt;a href=\"Foy%20D.%20Kohler\"&gt;Foy D. Kohler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seymour%20Weiss%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;Seymour Weiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jasper%20Welch\"&gt;Jasper Welch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wolfowitz\"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Nitze\"&gt;Paul Nitze&lt;/a&gt;, who had been instrumental in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20on%20the%20Present%20Danger\"&gt;Committee on the Present Danger&lt;/a&gt; (CPD) in 1950. Its objectives were to raise awareness about the Soviets' alleged nuclear dominance and to pressure American leaders to close the missile gap.\nDetailed sections.\nPart One.\nThe first section of the report dealt with the team's criticisms of the NIE's assessment of Soviet strategic objectives. It was the conclusion of the report, that the NIE was mostly wrong to view Soviet strategic actions as primarily a response to its history of being invaded and that the NIE ignored or misinterpreted evidence that most Soviet strategic actions were offensive rather than defensive in nature. The report also rejected the NIE's conclusion that as the Soviet Union grew more powerful and capable its foreign policy would also become less aggressive.\nPart Two.\nThe second section of the report was primarily a criticism of the NIE's conclusions regarding Soviet strategic weapons programs, and how they are integrated into conventional Soviet forces and what impacts they have on Soviet strategic goals and plans. The report argued that the NIE underestimated the threat posed by Soviet strategic weapons programs, and that the development and deployment of several new weapons platforms and advancements in existing technologies would drastically alter the advantages that the United States and NATO had over the Warsaw Pact. The report cited these specific areas to reinforce its assessment:\nCriticism.\nTeam B concluded that the Soviet Union did not adhere to the doctrine of &lt;a href=\"mutual%20assured%20destruction\"&gt;mutual assured destruction&lt;/a&gt;, but rather believed it could win a nuclear war outright. Pipes\u2014in his \"Commentary\" article\u2014argued that CIA suffered from \"mirror-imaging\" (i.e., from assuming that the other side had to\u2014and did\u2014think and evaluate exactly the same way); Pipes further wrote that Team B showed Soviet thinking to be based on winning a &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20warfare\"&gt;nuclear war&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., not avoiding such war due to MAD, because, he wrote, the Soviets were building &lt;a href=\"Multiple%20independently%20targetable%20reentry%20vehicle\"&gt;MIRV&lt;/a&gt;'d nuclear missiles of high yield and high accuracy\u2014appropriate for attacking hardened missile silos, but not needed for such large and vulnerable 'hostage' sites as cities). This was shocking to many at the time, but Pipes argues that later, after the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281982%E2%80%9391%29%23Dissolution%20of%20the%20USSR\"&gt;collapse of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, it was proven to be true.\n&lt;a href=\"Fareed%20Zakaria\"&gt;Fareed Zakaria&lt;/a&gt; notes, however, that the specific conclusions of the report \nwere wildly off the mark. Describing the Soviet Union, in 1976, as having 'a large and expanding Gross National Product,' it predicted that it would modernize and expand its military at an awesome pace. For example, it predicted that the Backfire bomber 'probably will be produced in substantial numbers, with perhaps 500 aircraft off the line by early 1984.' In fact, the Soviets had 235 in 1984.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Hessing%20Cahn\"&gt;Anne Hessing Cahn&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Arms%20Control%20and%20Disarmament%20Agency\"&gt;Arms Control and Disarmament Agency&lt;/a&gt;, 1977\u20131980), Team B's analysis of weapons systems was later proven to be false. \"I would say that all of it was fantasy. ... if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.\" The CIA director at the time, George H. W. Bush, concluded that the Team B approach set \"in motion a process that lends itself to manipulation for purposes other than estimative accuracy.\" &lt;a href=\"Brookings%20Institution\"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt; Scholar Raymond Garthoff concurred, writing that in \"retrospect, and with the Team B report and records now largely declassified, it is possible to see that virtually all of Team B's criticisms... proved to be wrong. On several important specific points it wrongly criticized and 'corrected' the official estimates, always in the direction of enlarging the impression of danger and threat.\" A top CIA analyst called Team B \"a &lt;a href=\"kangaroo%20court\"&gt;kangaroo court&lt;/a&gt; of outside critics all picked from one point of view.\"\nJoshua Rovner, Associate Professor at the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Naval%20War%20College\"&gt;U.S. Naval War College&lt;/a&gt;, argues that the Team B exercise made sense in theory because scrutiny from outside of the intelligence bureaucracy can pressure analysts to be forthright regarding their assumptions and methodology. Providing Team B the opportunity to create an alternative assessment could have shed light on any institutional baggage, group-think, and inefficiency. \"The competition turned ugly, however, when Team B turned its attention away from Moscow and leveled a blistering attack on the NIE process itself.\" It excoriated intelligence agencies for \"persistent flaws\" in past estimates and took it upon itself to \"determine what methodological misperceptions cause their most serious errors of judgment.\" The intelligence community was furious, Rovner maintains, because they believed that the exercise was motivated by an ideological desire to frame the Soviet Union as more belligerent than the intelligence community was leading on. The NIE that emerged from the debacle was strongly influenced by Team B's contributions. Rovner believes that Team B was a case of indirect politicization. \"The administration did not try to determine the membership of Team B nor the process of the exercise, but it gave de facto control over these pivotal issues to a group of outspoken critics of &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9tente\"&gt;d\u00e9tente&lt;/a&gt; who argued publicly that the United States was seriously underestimating the Soviet threat.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Richard%20K.%20Betts\"&gt;Richard K. Betts&lt;/a&gt;, the Arnold Saltzman Professor of War and Peace Studies at &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; argues that the underlying problem was confusion about what level of analysis was at issue\u2014an implicit blurring together of Soviet political objectives and military strategy. \n&lt;a href=\"Paul%20Warnke\"&gt;Paul Warnke&lt;/a&gt;, an official at the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Control%20and%20Disarmament%20Agency\"&gt;Arms Control and Disarmament Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ACDA) at the time of the Team B, wrote: \n&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Pipes\"&gt;Richard Pipes&lt;/a&gt; has defended the project, and in 2003 said:\nAlso in 2003, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Jay%20Epstein\"&gt;Edward Jay Epstein&lt;/a&gt; offered that Team B had been a useful exercise in competitive analysis.\n&lt;a href=\"Derek%20Leebaert\"&gt;Derek Leebaert&lt;/a&gt;, professor of government at Georgetown University, supported Team B in his 2002 book \"The Fifty Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Shapes Our World\". Although he agrees that \"Team B's alternative National Intelligence Estimate contained its own mistakes\", he claims that \"Russian sources now show that the Team B analysts were fundamentally correct on all the key issues.\" He further says that when Team B and the CIA debated their reports in 1976, the CIA \"conceded all essential points on Soviet nuclear war strategy to its harshest critics.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Jason%20Vest\"&gt;Jason Vest&lt;/a&gt; assessed the lasting implications of Team B:"
