    "text": "\"For other instances of Hico, see: &lt;a href=\"Hico%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Hico (disambiguation)&lt;/a&gt;\"\nHico (, ) is a small city located in &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; county in central &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, United States.\nNamed for its founder's hometown of &lt;a href=\"Hico%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Hico&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, Hico's original location was on Honey Creek. When the Texas Central line (part of the historic &lt;a href=\"Katy%20Railroad\"&gt;Katy Railroad&lt;/a&gt;) was built nearby, the citizens moved to the rail line. Hico was incorporated in 1883 and became the Hamilton County shipping center. Over the years, it became a &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; market. Today, &lt;a href=\"ranching\"&gt;ranching&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt; dominate the local economy.\nIn 1903, Kentucky-based evangelist &lt;a href=\"Mordecai%20Ham\"&gt;Mordecai Ham&lt;/a&gt; held the first of his 75 Texas revival meetings in Hico. There were 150 professions of faith in &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Brushy Bill\" Roberts and Billy the Kid.\n&lt;a href=\"Ollie%20P.%20Roberts\"&gt;Ollie P. Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, usually known as Ollie L. Roberts, \"Brushy Bill\" Roberts, or William Henry Roberts, a resident of Hico during the late 1940s, claimed to have been the outlaw &lt;a href=\"Billy%20the%20Kid\"&gt;Billy the Kid&lt;/a&gt;. Hico has capitalized on his infamy by opening a small Billy the Kid Museum, where visitors can decide whether Brushy Bill was indeed &lt;a href=\"William%20H.%20Bonney\"&gt;William H. Bonney&lt;/a&gt;. Brushy Bill claimed to have been born in &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Gap%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Buffalo Gap&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Abilene%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Abilene, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The museum offers a taped video presentation of &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, narrating a &lt;a href=\"Documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Brushy Bill's claim. There is also a replica of a 19th-century jail in the museum and other &lt;a href=\"artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s of the period.\nA marker devoted to Brushy Bill, located on Pecan Street in downtown Hico, reads: \"Ollie L. 'Brushy Bill' Roberts, alias Billy the Kid, died in Hico, Texas on December 27, 1950. He spent the last days of his life trying to prove to the world his true identity and obtain the pardon promised him by the governor of the state of &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lew%20Wallace\"&gt;Lew Wallace&lt;/a&gt;). We believe his story and pray to God for the forgiveness he solemnly asked for .\" The &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; television series \"&lt;a href=\"Unsolved%20Mysteries\"&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;\" did a segment on \"Brushy Bill\" Roberts' claim.\nAccording to Jan Canup, several relatives, including a son and grandson, of former Sheriff &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Garrett\"&gt;Patrick F. Garrett&lt;/a&gt; claim that their kinsman never killed Billy the Kid. There were no reliable witnesses to what body was actually placed in the Kid's grave, according to this line of argument. The Garrett family contends that Sheriff Garrett and Billy the Kid may have even plotted to collect the $500 reward offered for the capture of the outlaw. Roberts' grave has not been revealed, thus preventing DNA authentication of the remains.\nNext to the Brushy Bill marker on North Pecan Street is a large statue by the sculptor James Rice of Billy the Kid firing his gun. Downtown Hico, focused upon the Billy the Kid Museum on South Pecan Street, is a restored &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; community with businesses appealing to tourists. There are antique stores, gift shops, a drink shop, restaurants, and a gourmet popcorn shop.\nThe Hico community.\nHico has a small diner with a regional reputation: the Koffee Kup Family Restaurant, located at the main town intersection of Highway 281 (north-south) and &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%206\"&gt;Texas State Highway 6&lt;/a&gt; (east-west) From the outside the restaurant appears small, but it can seat 116 and is open for all three meals. Owned by Lynn E. Allen (born 1947), a former Hico School Board member, the Koffee Kup is known throughout the region, having been featured on &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Phillips\"&gt;Bob Phillips&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Texas%20Country%20Reporter\"&gt;Texas Country Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\" syndicated television series. The restaurant is particularly known for its &lt;a href=\"chicken-fried%20steak\"&gt;chicken-fried steak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strawberry%20pie\"&gt;strawberry pie&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"custard%20pie\"&gt;custard pie&lt;/a&gt;s. Adjacent to the Koffee Kup is the historical home of photographer Frank Rufus Wiseman (built 1903), which houses antiques and a chocolate company.\nEach July, Hico hosts Old Settlers Reunion at City Park. During the week the \"Citizen of the Year\" is recognized. Hico High School, which maintains a popular &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team under Coach Randy Thornton, holds its &lt;a href=\"homecoming\"&gt;homecoming&lt;/a&gt; observance at the same time as Old Settlers Day. Hico claims that its Old Settlers gathering, which dates to 1882, is the oldest of its kind in Texas. It has been held each year since 1882, except during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHico has maintained a &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; since 1861, and the first mail was carried by horseback. An early Hico business was Hico Ice and Cold Storage, which began in 1905. In time, it developed a major shipping market for eggs, chickens, and turkeys. The weekly newspaper, released on Thursdays, is the \"Hico News Review\", edited and published by Jerry E. McAdams (born 1951). The publication is a Texas Press Association Award winner.\nAcross Highway 281 from the \"Hico News Review\" is the First &lt;a href=\"Baptist\"&gt;Baptist&lt;/a&gt; Church, one of several congregations in the community. The historic First &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist\"&gt;United Methodist&lt;/a&gt; Church, also on Highway 281, was organized in 1881, with some 25 charter members. Six area churches later merged to become the Hico Methodist body. The current yellow brick sanctuary dates to 1903. The church is known for it support of both &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America\"&gt;Boy Scouts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Girl%20Scouts%20of%20the%20USA\"&gt;Girl Scouts&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanch life, including &lt;a href=\"horseback%20riding\"&gt;horseback riding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hayride\"&gt;hayride&lt;/a&gt;s, and camping, can be experienced at Timber Creek Ranch some southeast of Hico on Texas Highway 6.\nHico hosts the Annual Texas Steak Cookoff in May. It boasts thousands of guests every year.\nGeography.\nHico is located in the northern corner of Hamilton County at (31.984410, -98.030508).
