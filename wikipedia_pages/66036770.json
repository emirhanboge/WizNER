    "text": "The Espacio Lejano Station is a radio station located in &lt;a href=\"Loncopu%C3%A9%20Department\"&gt;Loncopu\u00e9 Department&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neuqu%C3%A9n%20Province\"&gt;Neuqu\u00e9n Province&lt;/a&gt;, Argentina, and operated by the &lt;a href=\"China%20National%20Space%20Administration\"&gt;Chinese National Space Administration&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Deep%20Space%20Network\"&gt;Chinese Deep Space Network&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Comisi%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20de%20Actividades%20Espaciales\"&gt;National Space Activities Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CONAE). The Chinese Deep Space Network is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC), which reports to the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Strategic%20Support%20Force\"&gt;People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force&lt;/a&gt;. The observatory is located north of Bajada del Agrio, near the Salado River on provincial route 33, in the so-called Pampa de Pilmatu\u00e9, in the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;. The station houses a 35-meter antenna. It is the first Chinese deep space earth station built outside &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. \nMany, including the &lt;a href=\"Presidency%20of%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; and local residents, have voiced concern that the station may be used for military or intelligence purposes, but others have challenged or tempered this view. Argentine officials have stated that China has agreed to use the station solely for &lt;a href=\"civilian\"&gt;civilian&lt;/a&gt;, not military, purposes. According to Chinese media, the station played a key role in China's &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Lunar%20Exploration%20Program\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in landing &lt;a href=\"Yutu-2\"&gt;a lunar rover&lt;/a&gt; on the dark side of the moon. Argentina's CONAE claims that the facility has allowed students from nearby towns to visit.\nThe plot which the station is based on consists of 494 acres of land, or two square kilometers. The land was leased in 2012 to the Chinese government for fifty years of use, and the agreement includes a tax exemption. China has invested $50 million into building the station. Future plans for the facility include research on &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. The Chinese ambassador to Argentina at the time, Yang Wanming, claimed the facility will generate 1,500 jobs in Argentina. The radio station employs at least thirty Chinese employees. The facility has reportedly had a positive effect on the local economy, including the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Lajas%2C%20Neuqu%C3%A9n\"&gt;Las Lajas&lt;/a&gt;, in part as a result of construction work which required 300 workers. The Argentinian government states that Argentina would benefit from the project by receiving access to exploit 10% of the station's use time, through CONAE, to benefit national scientific research projects."
