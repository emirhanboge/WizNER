    "text": "Caryopteris (bluebeard; ) is a genus of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Lamiaceae\"&gt;Lamiaceae&lt;/a&gt; (formerly often placed in the family &lt;a href=\"Verbenaceae\"&gt;Verbenaceae&lt;/a&gt;). They are native to east &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;).\nThey are &lt;a href=\"herbaceous%20plant\"&gt;herbaceous plant&lt;/a&gt;s or small &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;s growing to 1\u20134 m tall. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are opposite, simple ovate to lanceolate, with an entire or crenate margin; they are often aromatic. The blue or white &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are pollinated by butterflies and bumblebees. The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a four-valved &lt;a href=\"capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsule&lt;/a&gt; containing four seeds.\nCultivation and uses.\nThough several \"Caryopteris\" species are grown in &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;s, as &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;s the species have largely been superseded in gardens by the &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29%23Hybrid%20plants\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; \"Caryopteris\" \u00d7 \"clandonensis\" (\"C. incana\" \u00d7 \"C. mongholica\"). The accidental cross that produced it occurred in the garden of Arthur Simmonds at Clandon, near Guildford, Surrey. In 1930, wishing to propagate \"C. mongholica\", he gathered seeds from a plant that was growing near \"C. mastacanthus\". When the seedlings eventually flowered in their second year, hybrids appeared. The final selection, however, was made of a self-sown volunteer that appeared under \"C. mastacanthus\", and eventually smothered it. It began winning &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horticultural%20Society\"&gt;Royal Horticultural Society&lt;/a&gt; medals in 1933. This small, &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt;, aromatic shrub has grey-green leaves and produces masses of blue flowers in late summer.\n\"Caryopteris\" \u00d7 \"clandonensis\", an unusual plant in American gardens in the 1960s, has become more familiar there, especially in &lt;a href=\"xeriscaping\"&gt;xeriscaping&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike \"&lt;a href=\"Buddleja\"&gt;Buddleja&lt;/a&gt;\", the woody stems can die back in the winter, particularly in colder climates and on heavy soils. They prefer well-drained, sandy soil in full sun, but does not need especially rich soil or constant moisture.\nLeaves and herbaceous stems have a &lt;a href=\"terpene\"&gt;terpene&lt;/a&gt; aroma like &lt;a href=\"eucalyptus\"&gt;eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt;, especially when lightly bruised.\nCultivars.\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"cultivars\"&gt;cultivars&lt;/a&gt; with flowers in shades of blue or white, including 'Blue Mist', 'Heavenly Blue', 'Longwood Blue', 'Dark Knight', 'Summer Sorbet' and 'Pershore'.\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's &lt;a href=\"Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit\"&gt;Award of Garden Merit&lt;/a&gt;:-"
