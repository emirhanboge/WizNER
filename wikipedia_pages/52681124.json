    "text": "Best and Most Beautiful Things is a 2016 &lt;a href=\"documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary film&lt;/a&gt; directed by Garrett Zevgetis and produced by Zevgetis, Ariana Garfinkel, Jeff Consiglio, and Jordan Salvatoriello. The film's world premiere was held at the &lt;a href=\"South%20by%20Southwest\"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; (SXSW) Film Festival on March 14, 2016, where it was nominated for a Jury Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nSynopsis.\nThe film explores the coming of age of an exuberant and precocious young &lt;a href=\"visual%20impairment\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; woman, Michelle Smith, who identifies as being on the &lt;a href=\"autism%20spectrum\"&gt;autism spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. As she tries various ways of finding her true self in a new world of adults, she struggles with family tensions and trying to keep a job. On a more personal level, she begins developing a sense of sexual identity through exploring aspects of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20fetishism\"&gt;fetishism&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\nIn a December 1, 2016 review in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", Neil Genzlinger called the film \"a remarkably forthright documentary\" in which Ms. Smith makes \"a difficult transition for someone with disabilities - the end of the schooling years, with their structure and relative safety.\" The same review named the film a \"New York Times\" \"Critics' Pick.\""
