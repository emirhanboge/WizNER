    "text": "Ekipa (en. \"team\", English title: Prime Minister) is a Polish &lt;a href=\"political%20drama\"&gt;political drama&lt;/a&gt; TV series created and directed by &lt;a href=\"Agnieszka%20Holland\"&gt;Agnieszka Holland&lt;/a&gt;, aired from 13 September 2007 until 6 December 2007 (cancelled due to low audience figures) on &lt;a href=\"Polsat\"&gt;Polsat&lt;/a&gt;. Ekipa is the second Polish &lt;a href=\"political%20fiction\"&gt;political fiction&lt;/a&gt; series after the 1980s miniseries \"The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma\" based on &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Do%C5%82%C4%99ga-Mostowicz\"&gt;Tadeusz Do\u0142\u0119ga-Mostowicz&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Career%20of%20Nicodemus%20Dyzma\"&gt;novel of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreators.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Television%20program\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; is directed by three directors - &lt;a href=\"Agnieszka%20Holland\"&gt;Agnieszka Holland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magdalena%20%C5%81azarkiewicz\"&gt;Magdalena \u0141azarkiewicz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Katarzyna%20Adamik\"&gt;Katarzyna Adamik&lt;/a&gt;, and produced by &lt;a href=\"ATM%20Grupa\"&gt;ATM Grupa&lt;/a&gt; and Grupa Filmowa. &lt;a href=\"Copyrights\"&gt;Copyrights&lt;/a&gt; are owned by &lt;a href=\"Polsat\"&gt;Telewizja Polsat&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Script%20%28recorded%20media%29\"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; was created by Dominik Wieczorkowski-Rettinger and Wawrzyniec Smoczy\u0144ski.\nPlot.\nThe action of the series is set in present-day Poland. The story begins when &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and legendary opposition leader during &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Communist rule&lt;/a&gt; Henryk Nowasz of \"Polish Centre Bloc\" (\"Polski Blok Centrum\") was suspected of being an agent of the former communist security services. Nowasz decided to resign in order to prevent a government downfall and proposed non-partisan 37-year-old Professor of Economy and Political Sciences Konstanty Turski, his friend and an unofficial advisor, to become a caretaker until he could prove his innocence. Turski was narrowly confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt;, with silent opposition of the coalition party, \"Right-wing for Poland\" (\"Prawica dla Polski\"), whose leader, Jan Matajewicz, soon became his archenemy, with support of his party colleague, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Poland\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; Juliusz Szcz\u0119sny and both far-right and left-wing opposition parties. Turski, however, soon proved to be an effective (but idealistic and unconventional) leader, but his administration is involved with serious odds with other politicians. The key ally of Matajewicz is deputy &lt;a href=\"Sejm%20Marshal\"&gt;Sejm Marshal&lt;/a&gt; Krystyna Sochaczewska, a longtime Nowasz's friend from opposition and his successor as party leader.\nReal-life inspiration.\nFictional politicians in Ekipa are often said to be a \"TV alternative\" for the National Conservative administration of the &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Law and Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Series creators also mention \"&lt;a href=\"The%20West%20Wing\"&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt;\" as a model.\nHowever, there are some significant similarities to other U.S. political drama - &lt;a href=\"Commander%20in%20Chief%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Commander in Chief&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Mackenzie%20Allen\"&gt;Mackenzie Allen&lt;/a&gt;, Turski became a leader very accidentally. Also his chief opponent is Sejm Marshal, which could remind one of odds between Allen and Speaker of the House &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Templeton%20%28Commander%20in%20Chief%29\"&gt;Nathan Templeton&lt;/a&gt;. Third of all: Turski preserved all cabinet of his predecessor just as Allen did, despite lack of loyalty from number of ministers.\nNowasz's PBC is said to be based on former &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Freedom Union&lt;/a&gt;, while Matajewicz's PDP on Law and Justice.\nPolitical parties in Ekipa.\nSejm political parties in Ekipa:"
