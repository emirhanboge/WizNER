    "text": "Kirsty Sword Gusm\u00e3o, (born Kirsty Sword; 19 April 1966) is an &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n-&lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;ese activist who served as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Lady%20of%20East%20Timor\"&gt;First Lady of East Timor&lt;/a&gt; from 2002 until 2007. She is married to &lt;a href=\"Xanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o\"&gt;Xanana Gusm\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20East%20Timor\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20East%20Timor\"&gt;President of East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, though they separated in 2015. She is the founding director of the Alola Foundation, which seeks to improve the lives of women in Timor-Leste, a nation with one of the world's lowest &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20GDP\"&gt;per capita GDP&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEarly years and education.\nSword was born in 1966 in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, to schoolteachers Brian and Rosalie Sword, and was raised there and in &lt;a href=\"Bendigo\"&gt;Bendigo&lt;/a&gt;. She attended &lt;a href=\"Eaglehawk%2C%20Victoria%23Schools\"&gt;Eaglehawk Primary School&lt;/a&gt;, where her father was the principal and her mother a music teacher in the 1970s. She was taught her first &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; words by her father when she was four years old. She was a promising &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt; dancer, but decided not to pursue it as a career. As a teen, Sword travelled to &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; with her father and brother. After &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Square%20Secondary%20College\"&gt;Golden Square Secondary College&lt;/a&gt;, she attended &lt;a href=\"Monash%20University\"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s where she completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree, majoring in Indonesian and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, and a Diploma of Education. In 1985, while studying Indonesian at Monash, Sword met Timor-Leste students and took up their struggle for independence. Her father Brian died in 1998.\nCareer.\nSword worked as an administrative secretary with the Overseas Service Bureau (now &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Volunteers%20International\"&gt;Australian Volunteers International&lt;/a&gt;) until 1991, when she joined the Refugee Studies Program at &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; in England as assistant to the development coordinator. Later that year, she travelled to &lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"researcher\"&gt;researcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"interpreting\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Television\"&gt;Yorkshire Television&lt;/a&gt; documentary film called \"In Cold Blood: The massacre of East Timor\" about political and social developments in the territory.\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Sword lived and worked in &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, as an English teacher, &lt;a href=\"humanitarian%20aid\"&gt;humanitarian aid&lt;/a&gt; worker and &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; campaigner. At the same time, she became a clandestine &lt;a href=\"activist\"&gt;activist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; for the Timor-Leste (East Timorese) &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20movement\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to Indonesian rule. Her resistance &lt;a href=\"code%20name\"&gt;code name&lt;/a&gt; was Ruby Blade, later changed to \"Mukya\" (tr. 'fragrant') by Xanana Gusm\u00e3o.\nRegarding the eventual media revelation that a member of a supposedly neutral organisation was spying against a host country, whether any lasting damage was done to the capacity of humanitarian aid and human rights organisations to work freely in Indonesia is difficult to assess, as none of the relevant agencies have been willing to make official statements, however there has been some open criticism of her conduct that pointed out the lives of aid workers in Indonesia may have been endangered by the spying activities. Sword has deflected these criticisms by stating she did not consider herself bound by the codes of conduct applicable to aid workers.\nFrom resistance activist to First Lady.\nSword finally met Xanana Gusm\u00e3o face to face in December 1994 while he was serving a 20-year sentence in Jakarta's &lt;a href=\"Cipinang%20prison\"&gt;Cipinang prison&lt;/a&gt; for leading the East Timorese resistance group &lt;a href=\"FRETILIN\"&gt;FRETILIN&lt;/a&gt;. Their first contact came when she taught him English by correspondence from 1992. Ultimately she bluffed her way into the prison at Christmas 1994 on the pretence of visiting an uncle.\nXanana was released in 1999 and the couple married the following year in &lt;a href=\"Dili\"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, where they lived in the independent Timor-Leste with their three sons. In 2001 Sword Gusm\u00e3o brought the case of &lt;a href=\"sex%20trafficking%20in%20East%20Timor\"&gt;sex trafficking&lt;/a&gt; victim &lt;a href=\"Juliana%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;Juliana dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; to the attention of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;United Nations Commission on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;, as well as starting the \"Alola Foundation\". From May 2002 to May 2007, Xanana was President of Timor-Leste and Sword Gusm\u00e3o was its &lt;a href=\"First%20Lady\"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 November 2003, she published an &lt;a href=\"autobiography\"&gt;autobiography&lt;/a&gt; entitled \"A Woman of Independence\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2006%20East%20Timorese%20crisis\"&gt;2006 East Timorese crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Sword Gusm\u00e3o conducted media interviews and met Australian troops on behalf of her husband, who was immobile due to back pain. In May 2007, Xanana declined to run for another term as President, and was succeeded by his prime minister, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Ramos-Horta\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta&lt;/a&gt;, Xanana became Prime Minister on 8 August. In October, Sword Gusm\u00e3o was appointed to the honorary position of Goodwill Ambassador for Education of Timor-Leste by Ramos-Horta.\nOn 11 February 2008, national television reported that the motorcade of Gusm\u00e3o had come under gunfire one hour after President Ramos-Horta was shot in the stomach; according to the Associated Press, the two incidents raised the possibility of a &lt;a href=\"2008%20East%20Timorese%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt\"&gt;coup attempt&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"2008%20East%20Timorese%20assassination%20attempts\"&gt;assassination attempts&lt;/a&gt;, Sword Gusm\u00e3o was protecting her children from gunmen stalking their home. Also being sheltered was another woman and her four children, upon contacting Xanana by mobile phone Sword Gusm\u00e3o heard he was under gunfire. The Gusm\u00e3o family were reunited after negotiations between her guards and the gunmen allowed her through and, despite the risks of future attempts, Sword Gusm\u00e3o decided to remain in Timor-Leste.\nPersonal life.\nIn early 2013 it was reported that Sword Gusm\u00e3o had undergone treatment for breast cancer.\nAfter 15 years of marriage, it was announced in March 2015 that Sword Gusm\u00e3o and her husband were separating. She now lives in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; with the couple's three sons.\nAwards.\nOn 14 May 2014, Sword Gusm\u00e3o was admitted to the degree of Doctor of the University (\"honoris causa\") by &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20University%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Victoria University&lt;/a&gt; for her community service in championing the importance of education and improving the lives of women and children in &lt;a href=\"Timor-Leste\"&gt;Timor-Leste&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2015, Sword Gusm\u00e3o was appointed an &lt;a href=\"Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Officer of the Order of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (AO) \"For distinguished service to Australia-Timor-Leste relations through the development of mutual cooperation and understanding, particularly in the education sector, and as an advocate for improved health and living conditions for the Timorese people.\""
