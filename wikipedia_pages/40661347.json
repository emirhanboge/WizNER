He then joined local side United Sports Association in Khurai. He stayed with the side until he was spotted by &lt;a href=\"Pune%20F.C.\"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the &lt;a href=\"Pune%20F.C.%20Academy\"&gt;Pune F.C. Academy&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and played for the side in the &lt;a href=\"I-League%20U20\"&gt;I-League U20&lt;/a&gt; and other tournaments. While part of the academy set-up at Pune, Haokip helped his side to two back-to-back I-League U20 titles in both &lt;a href=\"2012%20I-League%20U20\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20I-League%20U20\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.\nPune.\n2013\u201314 season.\nBefore the start of the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20I-League\"&gt;2013\u201314 I-League&lt;/a&gt; season, it was announced that Haokip would be promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Pune%20F.C.\"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt; first-team.

His 72nd-minute goal opened the scoring for Pune as the club went on to win 2\u20130. His goal made him only the second ever Pune Academy player to score for the senior team after &lt;a href=\"Nikhil%20Kadam\"&gt;Nikhil Kadam&lt;/a&gt;. After scoring, Haokip gave credit to the Pune head coach, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Snoei\"&gt;Mike Snoei&lt;/a&gt;, for motivating him: \"The coach simply says; \u2018play aggressively, be strong and be confident in what I do when out on the field. He also told me \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019. I am a learner.\"\nHaokip scored the second goal of his career in the return fixture against Mohun Bagan on 21 December 2013.

His 65th-minute strike helped Pune to a 3\u20130 opening victory. The next month, during a match against Assam State Electricity Board in a Bhutan King's Cup pre-season tournament, Haokip scored a hat-trick as Pune booked their place into the semi-finals with a 5\u20130 victory.\nHaokip was then part of the 20\u2013member Pune squad that would participate in the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Indian%20Federation%20Cup\"&gt;Federation Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Haokip only managed to find the net once during the Federation Cup, on 5 January 2015 against &lt;a href=\"Bengaluru%20FC\"&gt;Bengaluru FC&lt;/a&gt;. Pune were thus knocked-out early from the competition. After the Federation Cup, the club returned to I-League play and on 24 January 2015 Haokip scored his first goal of the I-League season, against the reigning champions Bengaluru FC. His goal helped further increase Pune's lead as they ran out 3\u20131 winners over the trophy holders.\nIn the next match, Haokip managed to score the first hat-trick of the I-League season against &lt;a href=\"Shillong%20Lajong%20F.C.\"&gt;Shillong Lajong&lt;/a&gt;.

Haokip then continued his good form with a goal against &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Goa\"&gt;Sporting Goa&lt;/a&gt; on 21 February 2015 and then another goal in the next match against &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Wahingdoh%20F.C.\"&gt;Royal Wahingdoh&lt;/a&gt;. His goal against Royal Wahingdoh was the only one during the match and thus propelled Pune to the top of the I-League table. Haokip then scored his seventh and final goal of the season against &lt;a href=\"East%20Bengal%20F.C.\"&gt;East Bengal&lt;/a&gt; on 17 May 2015. His 65th-minute goal was the winning goal for Pune as they won 2\u20131.\nHaokip went on to finish the 2014\u201315 season as the top scorer among all Indians with seven goals.

Despite his performance in the &lt;a href=\"I-League\"&gt;I-League&lt;/a&gt; the previous season, Haokip was nervous about not being selected in the draft: \"At that time, I told myself, 'if I get picked up, it's good, if not I will have to work even harder.' Sometimes, I got this feeling that I won't be picked. There are many Indian and foreign players in the strikers position.\"\nHaokip did not make his debut for the side until 30 October 2015, when injuries forced head coach &lt;a href=\"Zico%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Zico&lt;/a&gt;'s hand, against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Pune%20City\"&gt;Pune City&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being forced into the line-up, Haokip managed to play the full match as Goa drew with Pune City 1\u20131. A few weeks later, on 17 November, Haokip made history in the league when he became on the second Indian in ISL history to score a hattrick. His three goals came against &lt;a href=\"Mumbai%20City%20FC\"&gt;Mumbai City&lt;/a&gt; as Goa bulldozed the Maharashtra side 7\u20130. Following the hattrick and subsequent victory, Zico was full of praise for Haokip: \"Haokip is a player who has a good technique and is very smart to play with. You can see the way he passes the ball and controls it during the game. He always wants to learn. He trains more than his team mates and is very receptive to information.\"\nHaokip then contributed greatly for Goa during the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Indian%20Super%20League%20Final\"&gt;2015 Indian Super League Final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Chennaiyin%20FC\"&gt;Chennaiyin&lt;/a&gt;.

He scored his only two goals of the season on 1 March 2016 against &lt;a href=\"East%20Bengal%20F.C.\"&gt;East Bengal&lt;/a&gt;.
