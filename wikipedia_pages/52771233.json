    "text": "Sara Peters Grozelier (1821\u20131907) was an American painter of &lt;a href=\"portrait%20miniature\"&gt;portrait miniature&lt;/a&gt;s. Her name is sometimes given as Sarah.\nLittle is known of Grozelier's life and career. She was born in &lt;a href=\"Andover%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Andover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest of the twelve children of John and Elizabeth Davis Peters; her elder sister was the miniaturist &lt;a href=\"Clarissa%20Peters%20Russell\"&gt;Clarissa Peters Russell&lt;/a&gt;, whose husband &lt;a href=\"Moses%20B.%20Russell\"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; was also a miniaturist. She graduated from Andover's Abbott Academy, where she learned painting and drawing, in 1836, and spent the next few years painting miniature portraits of prominent locals before moving to &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; at the age of twenty-six. In 1855 she married the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;-born &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20Grozelier\"&gt;Leopold Grozelier&lt;/a&gt;, a portraitist and lithographer. In that year she showed three miniatures at the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Athenaeum\"&gt;Boston Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;. The following year she showed another, at the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Art%20Association\"&gt;Brooklyn Art Association&lt;/a&gt;, under the sobriquet \"Madam Grozelier\". In 1866, after her husband's death, she was listed in the Boston directory; she was listed there again between 1877 and 1883. She also produced lithographs, and after her husband's death supported herself by painting over photographs in oil or pastel. At sixty-one she returned to &lt;a href=\"North%20Andover%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;North Andover&lt;/a&gt;. The Grozeliers had no children.\nGrozelier and her husband are buried at the &lt;a href=\"Ridgewood%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ridgewood Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Andover. A portrait of two girls by her is in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;; the date of the watercolor-on-ivory painting is unknown. A self-portrait, dated to between 1845 and 1855, is currently owned by the North Andover Historical Society."
