The college subsequently became part of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Adelaide\"&gt;University of Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 and, when the funding for rugby was withdrawn by the college in 2006, the club relocated to Lyndoch and became the Barossa Rams. In 2013 the Rams were promoted to Premier Grade in the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Union%20South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australian Rugby&lt;/a&gt; competition."
