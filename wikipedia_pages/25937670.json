    "text": "Gary Ray Bowles (January 25, 1962 \u2013 August 22, 2019) was an American &lt;a href=\"serial%20killer\"&gt;serial killer&lt;/a&gt; who was &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment%20in%20Florida\"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 for the murders of six men in 1994. He is sometimes referred to as The I-95 Killer since most of his victims lived close to the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095\"&gt;Interstate 95&lt;/a&gt; highway.\nEarly life.\nBowles was born in &lt;a href=\"Clifton%20Forge%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Clifton Forge, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and was raised in &lt;a href=\"Rupert%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Rupert, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. His father Frank, who worked as a coal miner, had died from &lt;a href=\"Coalworker%27s%20pneumoconiosis\"&gt;black lung disease&lt;/a&gt; six months before, and his mother Frances remarried several times. Bowles was &lt;a href=\"child%20abuse\"&gt;abused&lt;/a&gt; by his second stepfather, a violent &lt;a href=\"alcoholic\"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt; who also abused Bowles' mother and older brother.\nThe abuse continued until, at the age of 13, Bowles fought back and severely injured his stepfather. He left home soon thereafter, angered by his mother's decision to remain in the marriage. He was &lt;a href=\"homeless\"&gt;homeless&lt;/a&gt; for the next few years, earning money as a &lt;a href=\"male%20prostitution\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; to men.\nIn 1982, he was arrested for beating and &lt;a href=\"sexual%20assault\"&gt;sexually assaulting&lt;/a&gt; his girlfriend, and was sentenced to six years in prison. In 1991, after his release from prison, he was convicted of unarmed robbery in the theft of an elderly woman's purse, a crime for which he was sentenced to four more years in prison; he was released in two.\nMurders.\nOn March 15, 1994, in &lt;a href=\"Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Daytona Beach, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Bowles killed his first known victim, John Hardy Roberts, age 59, who had offered him a temporary place to live. Bowles beat and strangled him to death, and then stole his &lt;a href=\"credit%20card\"&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt;. Police soon considered him a suspect after finding his &lt;a href=\"fingerprint\"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"probation\"&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt; records at the crime scene. \nOver the next six months, Bowles murdered four other men: David Jarman, age 39, Milton Bradley, age 72 (no relation to the &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Bradley\"&gt;American business magnate&lt;/a&gt;), Alverson Carter Jr., age 47, and Albert Morris, age 38, in &lt;a href=\"Nassau%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Nassau County, Florida&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Wheaton%E2%80%93Glenmont%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Wheaton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Montgomery County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. His typical \"&lt;a href=\"modus%20operandi\"&gt;modus operandi&lt;/a&gt;\" was to prostitute himself to his victims before beating and strangling them, and stealing their credit cards. \nWhile on the run, Bowles was put on the &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Ten%20Most%20Wanted%20Fugitives\"&gt;list of the country's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives&lt;/a&gt; for his four known victims. On November 22, 1994, Bowles was arrested for the murder of Walter Jamelle \"Jay\" Hinton in &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%20Beach%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville Beach, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and confessed to all six murders.\nFollowing his arrest for the murders, Bowles told police that following his 1991 release from prison he had moved to Daytona Beach, and moved in with a girlfriend and resumed working as a prostitute. According to Bowles, his girlfriend became pregnant but then had an abortion after she learned that Bowles was a sex worker. Bowles told police officers that he blamed gay men for the abortion, and this led him to becoming a murderer.\nAftermath.\nIn May 1996, Bowles pleaded guilty to the killing of Walter Jamelle Hinton in Jacksonville on November 17, 1994. Hinton died after Bowles hit his head with a 40-pound (18\u00a0kg) &lt;a href=\"Stepping%20stones\"&gt;stepping stone&lt;/a&gt; while Hinton was sleeping and stuffed a towel down his throat during the struggle. Bowles received the death penalty for Hinton's murder. In August 1997, while sitting on death row for the slaying of Hinton, Bowles pleaded guilty to beating and strangling Roberts in 1994.\nBowles was found guilty of three counts of murder and &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment\"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt;, but the sentence was reversed by the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Florida Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, when they determined that the court erred by allowing the jury to hear that Bowles hated homosexuals and that the victim was gay. He was given a new sentencing hearing, and in 1999 again received the death penalty.\nBowles was executed by &lt;a href=\"lethal%20injection\"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20people%20executed%20in%20the%20United%20States%20in%202019\"&gt;August 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Prison\"&gt;Florida State Prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Starke%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Starke&lt;/a&gt;. Bowles ate three cheeseburgers, french fries, and bacon as a &lt;a href=\"last%20meal\"&gt;last meal&lt;/a&gt;."
