    "text": "The Harker School is a private, non-profit school located in &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%2C%20California\"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1893 as Manzanita Hall, Harker now has three campuses: Union, Bucknall, and Saratoga, named after the streets on which they lie.\nAbout.\nThe Union campus houses the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20School\"&gt;Middle School&lt;/a&gt; (grades 6-8), the Bucknall campus houses the Lower School (&lt;a href=\"kindergarten\"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; through grade 5), and the Saratoga campus houses the Upper School (grades 9 through 12).\nHarker School's tuition is significantly higher than most comparable private schools in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area\"&gt;Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the 35+ after-school programs have historically been included in the tuition.\nHistory.\nThe Harker School was founded as three distinct schools, which merged in 1972 to form Harker Academy and in 1993, Harker School.\nManzanita Hall and Palo Alto Military Academy.\nIn 1893, the school was a boys day school and boarding school, by the name of \"Manzanita Hall\" founded by Frank Cramer. The \"Manzanita Hall\" school was originally located at 1129 Parkinson Avenue in &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt;, California. In 1915, the enrollment was 60 boys. in 1919, \"Manzanita Hall\" was purchased and renamed as \"Palo Alto Military Academy\", and that school remained until 1972.\nMiss Harker's School.\nIn 1902, \"Miss Harker's School\" was founded by Cathrine Harker as a girls day school, with a limited boarding school, also located in Palo Alto. In 1917, the enrollment was 40 girls and was served as a preparatory school for competitive colleges such as &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. From 1902 to 1907, \"Miss Harker's School\" was located at 1121 Bryant Street in Palo Alto; and moved to 1050 Greenwood Avenue in Palo Alto, where the campus grew in size and the nearby streets were renamed (Melville and Harker Street) to reflect the campus.\nHarker Academy.\nIn 1972, there was a merger between the \"Palo Alto Military Academy\" and \"Miss Harker's School\" in order to form the \"Harker Academy\". With the merger, the school moved to 500 Saratoga Avenue in San Jose, California. in 1993, the school name changed to \"Harker School\".\nIn 1954, the Harker School joined the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Association%20of%20Schools%20and%20Colleges\"&gt;Western Association of Schools and Colleges&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampus.\nUpper school.\nThe upper school, offering grades 9 through 12, is located on the Saratoga Avenue campus. The campus was previously home to an all-girls school, \"Mother Butler Memorial High School\", which merged with &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Mitty%20High%20School\"&gt;Archbishop Mitty High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. The upper school was added to the K-8 program in 1998, with the first class of graduates in 2002.\nMiddle school.\nThe middle school is located on the Union campus, the former site of the Harker Preschool. Since the opening of the upper school in 1998, most students choose to remain at Harker School after middle school. Many components ease the shift from the lower school to the middle school, including various athletic and artistic programs. There is also a fine arts requirement: students in grades 7 and 8 must take at least one arts class or participate in one art event in order to graduate (sixth graders are encouraged to do so, as well).\nLower school.\nThe elementary school is located on the Bucknall campus, the former site of \"Bucknall Elementary School\".
