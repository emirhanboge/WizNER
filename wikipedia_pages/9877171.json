    "text": "Ram\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia (May 24, 1851 \u2013 October 3, 1928) was a &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20people\"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Conservative%20Party\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, military officer and &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;statesman&lt;/a&gt;. He participated in the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Civil%20War%20of%201876\"&gt;civil wars of 1876&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Civil%20War%20of%201895\"&gt;Colombian Civil War of 1895&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Days%20War\"&gt;Thousand Days War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiographic data.\nGonz\u00e1lez Valencia was born in the town of &lt;a href=\"Chitag%C3%A1\"&gt;Chitag\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norte%20de%20Santander%20Department\"&gt;Norte de Santander Department&lt;/a&gt;, on May 24, 1851. He died in the city of &lt;a href=\"Pamplona\"&gt;Pamplona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norte%20de%20Santander%20Department\"&gt;Norte de Santander Department&lt;/a&gt;, on October 3, 1928.\nMilitary career.\nAlthough Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was a young farmer, working in agriculture and cattle rising, he enlisted in the military during the civil wars of the time. His military career began in 1876, at the battle of \"\u201cHatogrande\u201d\", the conservative revolt against President &lt;a href=\"Aquileo%20Parra\"&gt;Aquileo Parra&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, during the liberal revolt against President &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Antonio%20Caro\"&gt;Miguel Antonio Caro&lt;/a&gt;, in 1895, once again he enlists in the national army to fight for his conservative beliefs. He repeated this same action during the civil war of \"\u201cthe Thousand Days\u201d\". Throughout his military career he was highly regarded for his courageous and compassionate attitude. He was ascended to the rank of General of the Army.\nGonz\u00e1lez Valencia also held the offices of \"\u201cJefe Civil y Militar\u201d\" (Military Governor) of &lt;a href=\"Santander%20Department\"&gt;Santander Department&lt;/a&gt; and Minister of War during the administration of President &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Marroqu%C3%ADn\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Manuel Marroqu\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, in 1901.\nThe Presidency.\nGonz\u00e1lez Valencia, in 1904, was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Conservative%20Party\"&gt;Colombian Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; to be the running mate of &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Reyes\"&gt;Rafael Reyes&lt;/a&gt; as his vice-president. The &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Colombian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; abstained from participating in the presidential election of this year, and both Reyes and Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia won the election. Nevertheless, and soon after the election, their ideological differences became apparent. Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was a right wing conservative and Reyes was a moderate.\nGeneral Reyes, who was politically more ambitious than General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, could not forget the events of July 31, 1900, when Vice-President &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Marroqu%C3%ADn\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Manuel Marroqu\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of the military and the conservative party, had removed for m office President &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Antonio%20Sanclemente\"&gt;Manuel Antonio Sanclemente&lt;/a&gt;. Because President &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Reyes\"&gt;Rafael Reyes&lt;/a&gt; had opened the doors to a dialogue with the liberals, this made the conservatives very suspicious. Because General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was highly appreciated by both, the Army and the conservative party, this made General Reyes very uncomfortable. Thus, General Reyes had to contrive a plan to remove General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia from the vice-presidency. He requested the intervention of two common friends of him and General Gonz\u00e1lez, the Ambassador of the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City%20State\"&gt;Vatican City State&lt;/a&gt;, Nuncio Apost\u00f3lico Monsignor Francisco Ragonessi and Don Luis Mart\u00ednez Silva, to whom he expressed his concerns and intentions. General Reyes asked them to please communicate, in the best possible manner, to General Gonz\u00e1lez his decision.\nTherefore, Monsignor Francisco Ragonessi and Mart\u00ednez Silva contacted General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, who was in &lt;a href=\"C%C3%BAcuta\"&gt;C\u00facuta&lt;/a&gt;. They conveyed the message and explained to him that General Reyes would very much appreciate his \u201cvoluntary\u201d resignation to the office he had been elected to. All three agreed to meet in &lt;a href=\"Duitama\"&gt;Duitama&lt;/a&gt;, an equidistant point between &lt;a href=\"Bogot%C3%A1\"&gt;Bogot\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; and C\u00facuta. On March 9, 1905, they met, as agreed, and General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia submitted his resignation.\nGeneral Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia served as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Reyes\"&gt;Rafael Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, who because of personal and professional differences, fired him and abolished the office of the vice presidency. It was not until the enactment of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Constitution%20of%201991\"&gt;Colombian Constitution of 1991&lt;/a&gt; that the vice-presidency was reinstated again. He also served as &lt;a href=\"Acting%20president\"&gt;Interim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Colombia\"&gt;President of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; from August 3, 1909 to August 7, 1910.\nGeneral Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, in his letter of resignation, addressed to the nation and not to General Reyes, said: \"\u201cIn the best interest of the country and for the high ideals of the party, I resign today voluntarily, before the nation that honored and trusted me with this high office, because of the incompatibilities between the President and the Vice-President\u201d\". The resignation was obviously not voluntarily, in light of the demands of the \"\u201cdictador de facto\u201d\". The liberal party manifested great appreciation to Monsignor Ragonessi for his valuable service in furtherance of the peace process in the nation.\nThe political tide and public opinion changed in disfavor of General Reyes. He resigned as President and handed over the office to President Interim &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Holgu%C3%ADn\"&gt;Jorge Holgu\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;. General Reyes, on his way out of the country, met with General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia in the port of &lt;a href=\"Gamarra%2C%20Cesar\"&gt;Gamarra&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to retake his office of Vice-President. General Reyes declined his offer, for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, once that General Reyes had left the country, Congress convened on July 20, 1909, and elected General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia as president of Colombia. General Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia was inaugurated on August 3, 1909, and was to serve until August 6, 1910."
