    "text": "A citrus reamer, also known as a lemon reamer or simply a reamer, is a small &lt;a href=\"kitchen%20utensil\"&gt;kitchen utensil&lt;/a&gt; used to extract the &lt;a href=\"juice\"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"lemon\"&gt;lemon&lt;/a&gt; or other small &lt;a href=\"citrus%20fruit\"&gt;citrus fruit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt consists at one end of a convexly tapered &lt;a href=\"cone%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;conical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;, with deep straight troughs running the length of the blade. The very tip of the blade is often a smooth spike. The other end is a cylindrical handle. The blade is usually made of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"metal\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;. The handheld reamer, which is held in one hand while the lemon or &lt;a href=\"lime%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt; is held in the other, is a relatively new adaptation of the traditional glass or plastic citrus reamer (with a juice rim) that was placed on a table and pressed downward.\nTo use a hand reamer, the user first slices a chosen fruit in half with a knife along its equatorial midsection. Grasping the fruit in one hand and the reamer in the other, the user first pierces the exposed &lt;a href=\"flesh\"&gt;flesh&lt;/a&gt; of the fruit with the tip of the reamer blade, then grinds out the inside with a twisting wrist motion until nearly all of the juice is extracted. This dislodges the &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; and some amount of &lt;a href=\"pith\"&gt;pith&lt;/a&gt;, so the juice must generally be strained before use. It works well with limes and lemons, but larger citrus fruits (&lt;a href=\"grapefruit\"&gt;grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; in particular) require a larger device."
