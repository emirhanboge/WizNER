    "text": "Cormac Murphy-O'Connor (24 August 1932 \u2013 1 September 2017) was a British &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;cardinal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Archbishop of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and president of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Bishops%27%20Conference%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;. He was made cardinal by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. He submitted his resignation as archbishop on reaching his 75th birthday in 2007; &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; accepted it on 3 April 2009.\nBy virtue of his position as Archbishop of Westminster, Murphy-O'Connor was sometimes referred to as the Catholic &lt;a href=\"primate%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Primate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;. However, though the holders within the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; of the posts of &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of York&lt;/a&gt; are called the \"Primate of All England\" and \"Primate of England\" respectively, the title of primate has never been used by the \"de facto\" leaders of the Catholic Church in England and Wales.\nEarly life.\nCormac Murphy-O'Connor was born on 24 August 1932 in &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkshire\"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth son of George Murphy-O'Connor, a G.P., and Ellen (n\u00e9e Cuddigan; died 1971), who emigrated from &lt;a href=\"County%20Cork\"&gt;County Cork&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland before the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and married in 1921. The Murphy-O'Connor family was middle class, with the men becoming doctors or priests, and one in each generation taking over the family business as wine merchants 'to the clergy and gentry of Southern Ireland'. A forebear, Daniel Murphy, became the first &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Hobart\"&gt;Archbishop of Hobart, Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, in 1888, having served as a bishop there since 1865. Two of his uncles, one aunt, two cousins and two of his brothers, Brian (1930\u20132012) and Patrick, were also ordained or members of religious orders. His youngest brother, John, was a regular officer in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Artillery\"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt; who died of &lt;a href=\"renal%20cell%20carcinoma\"&gt;renal cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;; he had two other siblings, James (a doctor and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; player) and Catherine. His cousin, &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Murphy-O%27Connor\"&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, was a Dominican priest and expert on St Paul who served as Professor of &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"%C3%89cole%20Biblique\"&gt;\u00c9cole Biblique&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; from 1967 to his death in 2013. After attending &lt;a href=\"Presentation%20College%2C%20Reading\"&gt;Presentation College&lt;/a&gt; in Reading and &lt;a href=\"Prior%20Park%20College\"&gt;Prior Park College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt;, in 1950 Murphy-O'Connor followed his brother Brian to the &lt;a href=\"English%20College%2C%20Rome\"&gt;Venerable English College&lt;/a&gt; in Rome and began his studies for the priesthood, where he received a degree in theology. Thereafter, he earned a &lt;a href=\"Licentiate%20%28degree%29\"&gt;licentiate&lt;/a&gt; in philosophy and a &lt;a href=\"Licentiate%20of%20Sacred%20Theology\"&gt;Licentiate of Sacred Theology&lt;/a&gt; degree from the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Gregorian%20University\"&gt;Pontifical Gregorian University&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Orders\"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; on 28 October 1956, by Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Valerio%20Valeri\"&gt;Valerio Valeri&lt;/a&gt;. For the next decade he was engaged in pastoral ministry in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fareham\"&gt;Fareham&lt;/a&gt;.\nChurch career.\nParish priest.\nIn 1966, Murphy-O'Connor became the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20assistant\"&gt;private secretary&lt;/a&gt; to Bishop &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Worlock\"&gt;Derek Worlock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. In September 1970, he was appointed parish priest of the Immaculate Conception church in &lt;a href=\"Portswood\"&gt;Portswood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterwards, in late 1971, he was appointed rector of the Venerable English College, his alma mater. As rector he hosted the Anglican &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Coggan\"&gt;Donald Coggan&lt;/a&gt;, on his historic visit to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. \nBishop.\nOn 17 November 1977, Murphy-O'Connor was named &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Arundel%20and%20Brighton\"&gt;Bishop of Arundel and Brighton&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;episcopal consecration&lt;/a&gt; on the following 21 December from Bishop &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bowen%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Michael Bowen&lt;/a&gt;, with Archbishop &lt;a href=\"George%20Dwyer\"&gt;George Dwyer&lt;/a&gt; and Bishop &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Emery%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Anthony Emery&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"consecrator\"&gt;co-consecrators&lt;/a&gt;. He held important positions among the bishops of Europe and has also been consistently influential in &lt;a href=\"Ecumenism\"&gt;ecumenical&lt;/a&gt; work; from 1982 to 2000 he was a co-chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%E2%80%93Roman%20Catholic%20International%20Commission\"&gt;Anglican\u2013Roman Catholic International Commission&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000 he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Lambeth%20degree\"&gt;Lambeth degree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Doctor of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; by the Archbishop of Canterbury, &lt;a href=\"George%20Carey\"&gt;George Carey&lt;/a&gt;, in recognition of his work for Christian unity.\nArchbishop and cardinal.\nMurphy-O'Connor was appointed the tenth &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Archbishop of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, and thus &lt;a href=\"primate%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Catholic Church in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, on 15 February 2000; in November of that year he was elected President of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Bishops%27%20Conference%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20consistory\"&gt;consistory&lt;/a&gt; of 21 February 2001 he was created &lt;a href=\"Cardinal-Priest\"&gt;Cardinal-Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20sopra%20Minerva\"&gt;Santa Maria sopra Minerva&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was appointed to four &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Curia\"&gt;curial&lt;/a&gt; organisations: the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20Divine%20Worship%20and%20the%20Discipline%20of%20the%20Sacraments\"&gt;Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Administration%20of%20the%20Patrimony%20of%20the%20Holy%20See\"&gt;Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See&lt;/a&gt;, the Pontifical Council for the Study of Organisational and Economic Problems of the Holy See, and the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20the%20Family\"&gt;Pontifical Council for the Family&lt;/a&gt;. He also served on the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20Culture\"&gt;Pontifical Councils for Culture&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20the%20Laity\"&gt;Laity&lt;/a&gt;, and was secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20Divine%20Worship%20and%20the%20Discipline%20of%20the%20Sacraments%23Vox%20Clara%20commission\"&gt;\"Vox Clara\" commission&lt;/a&gt; which oversees the translating of liturgical texts from &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; into English.\nMurphy-O'Connor belonged to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen%20Group\"&gt;a group of approximately a dozen like-minded cardinals and bishops&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 all Europeans\u00a0\u2013 who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland, to discuss reforms with respect to the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy and sexual morality; they differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Ratzinger\"&gt;Joseph Ratzinger&lt;/a&gt; was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave.\nIn August 2001, Murphy-O'Connor was created a &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London\"&gt;Freeman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2002, he preached during the Anglican morning service at Sandringham, the first time a Roman Catholic prelate delivered a sermon to an English monarch since 1680. In 2002, in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, he was the first cardinal to read prayers at an English &lt;a href=\"State%20funeral\"&gt;Royal Funeral Service&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Bowes-Lyon\"&gt;the Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt;) since 1509. In 2002 he had his portrait painted for Westminster Cathedral by the artist &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Furr\"&gt;Christian Furr&lt;/a&gt;. In advance of the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20conclave%2C%202005\"&gt;2005 papal conclave&lt;/a&gt;, where Murphy-O'Conner served as a cardinal elector, Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Achille%20Silvestrini\"&gt;Achille Silvestrini&lt;/a&gt; told reporters to watch for Murphy-O'Connor to emerge as a possible new pope. He was ineligible to participate in &lt;a href=\"Papal%20conclave%2C%202013\"&gt;the 2013 conclave&lt;/a&gt; due to being aged over 80.\nOn 28 October 2006, Murphy-O'Connor celebrated 50 years of ordination with a Jubilee Mass in Westminster Cathedral.\nRetirement.\nShortly before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Murphy-O'Connor submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Westminster to Pope Benedict XVI, who asked that Murphy-O'Connor remain in his position \"until he chooses otherwise\". On 3 April 2009 Benedict appointed &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Nichols\"&gt;Vincent Nichols&lt;/a&gt; as Murphy-O'Connor's replacement. All Murphy O'Connor's predecessors died in office, so he was the first Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster. He lived the remainder of his life in semi-retirement in Duke's Avenue, Chiswick, London.\nOn 30 October 2009, Pope Benedict appointed Murphy-O'Connor a member of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20Bishops\"&gt;Congregation for Bishops&lt;/a&gt;, a post he held until his 80th birthday. It was unusual to receive such an appointment after retirement.\nIn June 2010, after the &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Report\"&gt;Ryan Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Murphy%20Report\"&gt;Murphy Report&lt;/a&gt; on the abuses by the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Catholic Church in Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Murphy-O'Connor was named along with others to oversee the &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20visitation\"&gt;apostolic visitation&lt;/a&gt; of certain dioceses and seminaries. Murphy-O'Connor was named as the visitor to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Armagh\"&gt;Diocese of Armagh&lt;/a&gt; and its suffragan sees.\nMurphy-O'Connor, in a speech delivered on 17 May 2012 at &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20Cathedral\"&gt;Leicester's Anglican cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, said, \"In the name of tolerance it seems to me tolerance is being abolished.\" He said:\nA friend of Pope Francis, he was a hardliner with regard to sexual child abuse cases. In 2018, the dioceses of Arundel and Brighton, Westminster, Portsmouth and Northampton were put under the so-called \"Truth Project\", a government-commissioned investigation which asked to the Archdiocese of Westminster to release his files pertaining to the minor victims'allegations.\nMurphy-O'Connor died of cancer on 1 September 2017 after an extended hospital stay. He was buried under the 10th Station of the Cross in Westminster Cathedral. As he was the 10th Archbishop of Westminster, and also because this station is directly opposite the Chapel of St Patrick, he was buried there in accordance with his wishes due to his Irish connection with County Cork in Ireland.\nViews.\nAbuse scandal.\nMurphy-O'Connor found himself subject to public scrutiny regarding a priest in his diocese when he was Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. During this time it was brought to his attention that a priest, Michael Hill, was a &lt;a href=\"Child%20sexual%20abuse\"&gt;sexual abuser of children&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, when Murphy O'Connor became Archbishop of Westminster, the case became known to the general public.\nInstead of reporting Hill to the &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, Murphy-O'Connor allowed the crime to be covered up and transferred Hill to &lt;a href=\"Gatwick%20Airport\"&gt;Gatwick Airport&lt;/a&gt; chapel, where the Cardinal believed he would not be able to &lt;a href=\"child%20molestation\"&gt;molest&lt;/a&gt; children. In 1997, Hill was convicted as a child molester and jailed for &lt;a href=\"sexual%20assault\"&gt;sexually assaulting&lt;/a&gt; nine children. After three years in jail, Hill was given another five years for assaulting three other boys.\nIslam.\nIn 2004, the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Council%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Muslim Council of Britain&lt;/a&gt; criticised Murphy-O'Connor when he said that Muslim leaders were not doing enough to denounce terrorists who carried out attacks \"in the name of Allah\", while clarifying that they denounced terrorism.\nResponse to \"Summorum Pontificum\".\nIn July 2007, Murphy-O'Connor welcomed Pope Benedict XVI's relaxation of restrictions on the use of the 1962 &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Missal\"&gt;Roman Missal&lt;/a&gt;. He said:\nWhen he issued a letter implementing the pope's rules to the clergy of his diocese in November, he was criticized in some quarters for requiring parish priests to request permission before Mass could be celebrated in that traditional form.\nAIDS prevention.\nOn 3 December 2006, Murphy-O'Connor issued a response to a statement made by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Blair\"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"World%20AIDS%20Day\"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; (1 December 2006) in which Blair said, \"The danger is if we have a sort of blanket ban from religious hierarchy saying it's wrong to do it, then you discourage people from doing it in circumstances where they need to protect their lives.\" In response to this Murphy-O'Connor said,\nStatus of immigrants.\nOn 7 May 2007, Murphy-O'Connor addressed a crowd of &lt;a href=\"illegal%20immigrant\"&gt;undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trafalgar%20Square\"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt; in support of the &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20into%20Citizens\"&gt;Strangers into Citizens&lt;/a&gt; campaign, which advocates a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Previously he had commissioned major research on the pastoral challenges migrants present in his parishes, which received widespread press coverage when published as \"The Ground of Justice\".\nAdoption by same-sex couples.\nIn early 2007, Murphy-O'Connor sent a letter to Tony Blair opposing pending regulations extending to same-sex couples the right to adopt on the same basis as different-sex couples. He said that the law would force people to \"act against the teaching of the Church and their own consciences\" with regard to Catholic adoption agencies and requested an exemption from the law. He continued:\nFamily planning.\nMurphy-O'Connor denounced &lt;a href=\"contraception\"&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; and abortion many times. In February 2008 he ordered the board of &lt;a href=\"Hospital%20of%20St%20John%20and%20St%20Elizabeth\"&gt;St John and St Elizabeth's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, a Catholic hospital partly funded by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29\"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, to resign because its general practice prescribed the morning-after pill and issued abortion referrals.\nIn February 2013, Murphy-O'Connor said that while a radical departure from previous teaching was not likely, it would be \"wise\" to focus on \"what's good and what's true\" about marriage and family life instead. He said:\nEmbryo bill.\nIn March 2008, Murphy-O'Connor joined Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Keith%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Keith O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in opposing the government's proposed &lt;a href=\"Human%20Fertilisation%20and%20Embryology%20Act%202008\"&gt;embryology bill&lt;/a&gt;. The government had instructed its MPs to vote for the bill, which angered some Catholic MPs. Murphy-O'Connor said \"Certainly, there are some aspects of this bill on which I believe there ought to be a &lt;a href=\"free%20vote\"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt;, because Catholics and others will want to vote according to their conscience.\" The government gave in to the pressure and promised to allow MPs a free vote.\nAtheism.\nIn 2008, Murphy-O'Connor urged Christians to treat atheists and agnostics with deep esteem, \"because the hidden God is active in their lives as well as in the lives of those who believe\". However, in 2009, speaking after Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Nichols\"&gt;Vincent Nichols&lt;/a&gt;' installation, he said that a lack of faith is \"the greatest of evils.\"\nIraq War.\nMurphy-O'Connor opposed the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;."
