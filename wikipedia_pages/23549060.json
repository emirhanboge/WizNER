    "text": "Frances Lake is a lake of &lt;a href=\"Yukon\"&gt;Yukon&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. It is the largest lake in Southeast Yukon. Several rivers and creeks flow into Frances Lake, forming extensive deltas. The lake and surrounding area was featured in Anton Money's 1975 autobiographical book \"This Was the North\" and one of the creeks is named Money Creek after this early settler to the area."
