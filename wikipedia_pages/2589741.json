    "text": "Madhabi Chakraborty , n\u00e9e Mukherjee, (born 10 February 1942) is an Indian actress. She won the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress\"&gt;National Film Award for Best Actress&lt;/a&gt; for her performance in the &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Dibratrir%20Kabya\"&gt;Dibratrir Kabya&lt;/a&gt;\". She has acted in some of the most critically acclaimed films in &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Bengali cinema&lt;/a&gt; and is considered one of the great actresses of Bengali cinema.\nEarly life.\nMadhabi Mukherjee was born on 10 February 1942 and was raised with her sister Manjari by their mother in &lt;a href=\"Kolkata\"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;, in what was then &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, India. As a young girl, she became involved in the theater.\nShe worked on stage with doyens such as &lt;a href=\"Sisir%20Bhaduri\"&gt;Sisir Bhaduri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahindra%20Choudhury\"&gt;Ahindra Choudhury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nirmalendu%20Lahiri\"&gt;Nirmalendu Lahiri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chhabi%20Biswas\"&gt;Chhabi Biswas&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the plays she acted in included \"Naa\" and \"Kalarah\". She made her film debut as a child artist in &lt;a href=\"Premendra%20Mitra\"&gt;Premendra Mitra&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Dui beaee\".\nFilms.\nMukherjee first made a major impact with &lt;a href=\"Mrinal%20Sen\"&gt;Mrinal Sen&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Baishey Shravan\" (\"Wedding Day\") in 1960. The film is set in a Bengal village before and during the horrific famine of 1943 in Bengal that saw over 5 million die. Mukherjee plays a 16-year-old girl who marries a middle-aged man. Initially, she brightens his life but then World War II and the Bengal Famine hits them. The couple's marriage disintegrates.\nHer next major film was &lt;a href=\"Ritwik%20Ghatak\"&gt;Ritwik Ghatak&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Subarnarekha%20%28film%29\"&gt;Subarnarekha&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Golden Thread \") made in 1962, but released in 1965 \u2013 the last in a trilogy examining the socio-economic implications of partition, the other two being \"&lt;a href=\"Meghe%20Dhaka%20Tara\"&gt;Meghe Dhaka Tara&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Cloud-Capped Star\") (1960) and \"&lt;a href=\"Komal%20Gandhar\"&gt;Komal Gandhar&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"E-Flat\") (1961). In the film, Ghatak depicts the economic and socio-political crisis of Bengal from 1948 to 1962; how the crisis has first and foremost left one bereft of one's conscience. Mukherjee plays Sita, the younger sister of Ishwar (Abhi Bhattacharya), who kills herself when\u2014as a prostitute waiting for her first customer\u2014she finds out the customer is none other than her estranged brother.\nWorking with Satyajit Ray.\nIn the early 1960s, she was recruited by &lt;a href=\"Satyajit%20Ray\"&gt;Satyajit Ray&lt;/a&gt; to portray the role of Arati in the 1963 film \"&lt;a href=\"Mahanagar\"&gt;Mahanagar&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Big City\").\nRecalling her meeting with Ray, Mukherjee wrote:\nIn \"Mahanagar\", Mukherjee plays Arati, who takes a job as a saleswoman due to financial constraints in the family. The large joint family is horrified at the thought of a working woman. For Arati, going door to door selling knitting machines opens up a whole new world and new friends and acquaintances, including an Anglo-Indian friend, Edith. Earning money also raises Arati's status in the family especially when her husband (&lt;a href=\"Anil%20Chatterjee\"&gt;Anil Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt;) loses his job. When Edith is sacked unfairly, Arati resigns in protest...Mukherjee's towering performance as Arati dominates the film. Film critic &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Ebert\"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; wrote: \"It might be useful to see the performance of Madhabi Mukherjee in this film. She is a beautiful deep, wonderful actress who simply surpasses all ordinary standards of judgment.\"\nThis film was followed by her portrayals of Charu in \"&lt;a href=\"Charulata\"&gt;Charulata&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Lonely Wife\"), the 1964 film based on &lt;a href=\"Rabindranath%20Tagore\"&gt;Rabindranath Tagore&lt;/a&gt;'s novella \"&lt;a href=\"Nashtanir\"&gt;Nashtanir&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Broken Nest\", 1901). Mukherjee's stunning portrayal of Charulata, a bored and neglected housewife of Calcutta in the 19th century, is a towering performance in the history of Indian cinema.\nMukherjee reached the peak of her career with this film. It is said that when Ray returned to Tagore with \"&lt;a href=\"Ghare%20Baire\"&gt;Ghare Baire&lt;/a&gt;\" (1984) (\"The Home and the World\"), he stylised Swatilekha Chatterjee in a manner similar to Madhabi in \"Charulata\".\nMukherjee's third and last film with Ray was \"&lt;a href=\"Kapurush\"&gt;Kapurush&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Coward\") in 1965. The film looks at Amitabha Roy (&lt;a href=\"Soumitra%20Chatterjee\"&gt;Soumitra Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt;), a screenwriter whose car breaks down in a small town. He lodges with a local resident, Bimal Gupta (Haradhan Bannerjee). Bimal is married to Karuna (Mukherjee), who was a former girlfriend of Amitabha, a fact of which Bimal is unaware.\nAfter Satyajit Ray.\nAlthough she remained a big star in the Bengali commercial film industry, after \"Kapurush\", Mukherjee failed to reach the critical heights as her films with &lt;a href=\"Ritwik%20Ghatak\"&gt;Ritwik Ghatak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satyajit%20Ray\"&gt;Satyajit Ray&lt;/a&gt; again.\nHer major films after \"Kapurush\" include \"&lt;a href=\"Calcutta%2071\"&gt;Calcutta 71&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1972 by &lt;a href=\"Mrinal%20Sen\"&gt;Mrinal Sen&lt;/a&gt;, \"Biraj Bou\" in 1972 by &lt;a href=\"Manu%20Sen\"&gt;Manu Sen&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Strir%20Patra%20%28film%29\"&gt;Strir Patra&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1972 by &lt;a href=\"Purnendu%20Patri\"&gt;Purnendu Patri&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Ganadevata%20%28film%29\"&gt;Ganadevata&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1978 by &lt;a href=\"Tarun%20Majumdar\"&gt;Tarun Majumdar&lt;/a&gt;, \"Bancharamer Bagan\" in 1980 by &lt;a href=\"Tapan%20Sinha\"&gt;Tapan Sinha&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Chokh\"&gt;Chokh&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1982, \"Chhandaneer\" in 1989 by &lt;a href=\"Utpalendu%20Chakrabarty\"&gt;Utpalendu Chakrabarty&lt;/a&gt; and \"Utsab\" in 2000 by &lt;a href=\"Rituparno%20Ghosh\"&gt;Rituparno Ghosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nMukherjee is married to Bengali film actor &lt;a href=\"Nirmal%20Kumar\"&gt;Nirmal Kumar&lt;/a&gt;. They have two daughters, but are currently separated.\nShe wrote her autobiography \"&lt;a href=\"Ami%20Madhabi\"&gt;Ami Madhabi&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1995."
