    "text": "Kabara was a &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20people\"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; village in the &lt;a href=\"Haifa%20Subdistrict%2C%20Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;Haifa Subdistrict&lt;/a&gt;. It was depopulated during the &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%931948%20Civil%20War%20in%20Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine&lt;/a&gt; on April 30, 1948. It was located 30\u00a0km southeast of &lt;a href=\"Haifa\"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nA cave in the vicinity contains artifacts from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Palaeolithic\"&gt;Middle Palaeolithic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Natufian\"&gt;Natufian&lt;/a&gt; periods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Exploration%20Fund\"&gt;PEF&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"PEF%20Survey%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;Survey of Western Palestine&lt;/a&gt;\" visited in 1873, and noted about \"Kebarah\": \"Traces of ruins exist here: a cave, and a tomb with nine \"kokim\", and an ante-chamber and entrance of masonry, with a circular &lt;a href=\"arch\"&gt;arch&lt;/a&gt; of small stones. Near this ruin the wall or dam, built to prevent the spreading north- wards of the marsh surrounding the Zerka, will be found marked on the Sheet, ending in a knoll on the east. The masonry resembles that in the aqueducts at C\u00e6sarea; the stones vary in length, averaging about 2 feet, and are set in cement. The wall is about 4 feet thick, with two rows of &lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt;, and thoroughbonds, being built in alternate headers and stretchers. The core of the wall is of rubble.\"\nBritish Mandate era.\nEarly in the mandate, a &lt;a href=\"Concessions%20in%20Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;government concession&lt;/a&gt; was granted to the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Jewish%20Colonization%20Association\"&gt;Palestine Jewish Colonization Association&lt;/a&gt; (PICA) to develop the area. A long-running legal dispute between the Palestinian inhabitants of the area, the Mandatory government, and PICA, continued through the period of the mandate.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1922%20census%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;1922 census of Palestine&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the &lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;British Mandate authorities&lt;/a&gt;, \"Kabara\" had a population of 73 Muslims. In the &lt;a href=\"1931%20census%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;1931 census&lt;/a&gt; it was counted with &lt;a href=\"Jisr%20az-Zarqa\"&gt;Jisr az-Zarqa&lt;/a&gt;, together they had a population of 572 Muslims, in a total of 117 houses.\nIn 1938 the &lt;a href=\"kibbutz\"&gt;kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ma%27ayan%20Tzvi\"&gt;Ma'ayan Tzvi&lt;/a&gt; was established on what traditionally had been village land.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Village%20Statistics%2C%201945\"&gt;1945 statistics&lt;/a&gt; it had a population of 120 Muslims, with a total of 9,831 dunams of which Muslims owned 1,070, Jews 3,487 and 5,247 was public land. Of the land, Arabs used 2 dunams for citrus and bananas, 20 for plantations and irrigable land, for cereals, while a total of 2,437 dunams was classified as non-cultivable land.\n1948 and aftermath.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Walid%20Khalidi\"&gt;Walid Khalidi&lt;/a&gt; no information is given about how the village became depopulated, but he assumes it was during the second campaign to \"clear\" the coastal areas of Arabs, that is, in late April, or early May, 1948. Following the war, the area was incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;State of Israel&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Ma%27agan%20Michael\"&gt;Ma'agan Michael&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1949 and &lt;a href=\"Beit%20Hanania\"&gt;Beit Hanania&lt;/a&gt; in 1950, both on village land.\nIn 1992 the village site was described: \"The rubble from the village houses has been moved up the slope where it is now visible, covered with dirt. Cactuses and banana trees, as well as isolated fig, carob, and olive trees grow on the site.\""
