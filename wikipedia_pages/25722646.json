    "text": "Ivan Medek (July 13, 1925 \u2013 January 6, 2010) was a Czech classical music critic, radio broadcaster and journalist. Medek was an important voice of the Czech &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; opposition movement, particularly after being forced into &lt;a href=\"exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; in 1978. Medek collaborated closely with such Czechoslovak politicians as &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Havel\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Havel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Tigrid\"&gt;Pavel Tigrid&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to communist rule.\nHe was a brother of the Czech painter &lt;a href=\"Mikul%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Medek\"&gt;Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Medek&lt;/a&gt; and the son of the general &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Medek\"&gt;Rudolf Medek&lt;/a&gt;. \nMedek was born in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, on July 13, 1925. He began his career as both a classical music critic and journalist. He worked as a musician for the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Philharmonic\"&gt;Czech Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; until he was fired by the government for his support of the opposition.\nMedek was an original signatory of the &lt;a href=\"Charter%2077\"&gt;Charter 77&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"manifesto\"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. Persecution by the communist government for his participation in Charter 77 forced Medek into &lt;a href=\"exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; beginning in 1978. Medek began working at the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20America\"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; in Austria, where he broadcast &lt;a href=\"news\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; and information into &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. His VoA radio broadcasts became an important link for anti-communist &lt;a href=\"dissidents\"&gt;dissidents&lt;/a&gt; in his native Czechoslovakia.\nMedek returned to Czechoslovakia from exile in 1989 during the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Revolution\"&gt;Velvet Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. In 1993, Medek was appointed to the office of the presidency under &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Havel\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Havel&lt;/a&gt;, the first president of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. He later became the head of the presidency, or chancellor, under Havel.\nMedek died in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; on January 6, 2010, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Helena."
