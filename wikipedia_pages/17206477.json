    "text": "KXAL-LP (104.7 &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt;) was a low-power &lt;a href=\"radio%20station\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; licensed to Chalk Hill Community, Texas, United States. The station aired a format consisting of &lt;a href=\"European%20classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, and was owned by The Church at Lake Cherokee.\n104.7 KXAL-LP signed on in 2002 as KZQX-LP, owned by Chalk Hill Educational Media and airing an &lt;a href=\"adult%20standards\"&gt;adult standards&lt;/a&gt; format. Principals of Chalk Hill Educational Media then acquired &lt;a href=\"KZQX\"&gt;KXAL-FM (100.3 MHz)&lt;/a&gt; in 2009; as a result, they had to divest the low-power FM license, which was sold to The Church at Lake Cherokee and changed to a light classical and jazz format. The sale was finalized in November 2009, and at that time 104.7 became KXAL-LP and 100.3 became KZQX.\nOn May 1, 2018, the station turned in its license for cancellation stating that \"it has become obvious...that KXAL-LP has outlived its usefulness\" and that the owners had searched unsuccessfully for a new owner to donate the station to. The &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; cancelled the license on May 24, 2018."
