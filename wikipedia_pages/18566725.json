Hennix was affiliated with &lt;a href=\"MIT\"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"AI%20Lab\"&gt;AI Lab&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1970s and was later employed as research professor of mathematics at &lt;a href=\"SUNY%20New%20Paltz\"&gt;SUNY New Paltz&lt;/a&gt;; she also worked with mathematician &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Esenin-Volpin\"&gt;Alexander Esenin-Volpin&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nCatherine Christer Hennix grew up in a musical environment; her mother was a &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; composer who frequently invited well-known American jazz musicians such as &lt;a href=\"Idrees%20Sulieman\"&gt;Idrees Sulieman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Dolphy\"&gt;Eric Dolphy&lt;/a&gt; around the house, and she saw &lt;a href=\"John%20Coltrane\"&gt;John Coltrane&lt;/a&gt; and others perform. Hennix took up drums and performed with her brother. Later, Hennix studied with &lt;a href=\"Stockhausen\"&gt;Stockhausen&lt;/a&gt; and was among the pioneers in Sweden experimenting with main-frame computer generated composite sound wave forms in the late 1960s. She studied &lt;a href=\"bio-chemistry\"&gt;bio-chemistry&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt; at university before settling on &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20logic\"&gt;mathematical logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the 1970s, she connected with &lt;a href=\"Fluxus\"&gt;Fluxus&lt;/a&gt; artists &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Higgins\"&gt;Dick Higgins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Allison%20Knowles\"&gt;Allison Knowles&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and began collaborative relationships with figures such as &lt;a href=\"La%20Monte%20Young\"&gt;La Monte Young&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Flynt\"&gt;Henry Flynt&lt;/a&gt;. She pursued studies with &lt;a href=\"raga\"&gt;raga&lt;/a&gt; master &lt;a href=\"Pandit%20Pran%20Nath\"&gt;Pandit Pran Nath&lt;/a&gt; and led the &lt;a href=\"just%20intonation\"&gt;just intonation&lt;/a&gt; live-electronic ensembles Hilbert Hotel and The Deontic Miracle. At the urging of Nath, she also pursued a career as a professor of mathematics and computer science, and assistant to and coauthor with &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Esenin-Volpin\"&gt;Alexander Esenin-Volpin&lt;/a&gt; for which she was given the Centenary Prize Fellow Award by the &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Mathematics%20Institute\"&gt;Clay Mathematics Institute&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.
