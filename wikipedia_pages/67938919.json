    "text": "Bimaximal mixing refers to a proposed form of the &lt;a href=\"lepton%20mixing%20matrix\"&gt;lepton mixing matrix&lt;/a&gt;. It is characterized by the formula_1 &lt;a href=\"neutrino\"&gt;neutrino&lt;/a&gt; being a \"bimaximal mixture\" of formula_2 and formula_3 and being completely decoupled from the formula_4, i.e. an uniform mixture of formula_2 and formula_3. The formula_4 is consequently a uniform mixture of formula_8 and formula_9. Other notable properties are the &lt;a href=\"symmetries\"&gt;symmetries&lt;/a&gt; between the formula_2 and formula_3 &lt;a href=\"Flavour%20%28particle%20physics%29\"&gt;flavours&lt;/a&gt; and formula_8 and formula_9 &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"eigenstates\"&gt;eigenstates&lt;/a&gt; and an absence of &lt;a href=\"CP%20violation\"&gt;CP violation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20value\"&gt;moduli&lt;/a&gt; squared of the matrix elements have to be:\nAccording to PDG convention, bimaximal mixing corresponds to formula_15 and formula_16, which produces following matrix:\nAlternatively, formula_18 and formula_16 can be used, which corresponds to:\nPhenomenology.\nThe L/E flatness of the &lt;a href=\"electron\"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;-like event ratio at &lt;a href=\"Super-Kamiokande\"&gt;Super-Kamiokande&lt;/a&gt; severely restricts the CP-conserving neutrino mixing matrices\nto the form:\nBimaximal mixing corresponds to formula_22. &lt;a href=\"Tribimaximal%20mixing\"&gt;Tribimaximal mixing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golden-ratio%20mixing\"&gt;golden-ratio mixing&lt;/a&gt; also correspond to an angle in the above parametrization. Bimaximal mixing, along with these other mixing schemes, have been falsified by a non-zero formula_23."
