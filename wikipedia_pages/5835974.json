    "text": "Earl Grant (January 20, 1931 \u2013 June 10, 1970) was an American pianist, &lt;a href=\"Hammond%20organ\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;ist, and vocalist popular in the 1950s and 1960s.\nCareer.\nGrant was born in &lt;a href=\"Idabel%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Idabel, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Though he would be known later for his keyboards and vocals, Grant also played trumpet and drums. Grant attended four music schools, eventually becoming a music teacher. He augmented his income by performing in clubs during his &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; service, throughout which he was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Bliss%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Fort Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, Texas. Grant signed with &lt;a href=\"Decca%20Records\"&gt;Decca Records&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 and his first single \"The End\" reached number 7 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"record%20chart\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. The album \"Ebb Tide (And Other Instrumental Favorites)\" sold over one million copies, gaining &lt;a href=\"music%20recording%20sales%20certification\"&gt;gold disc&lt;/a&gt; status. He &lt;a href=\"sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction\"&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt; six more singles that made the charts, including \"Swingin' Gently\" (from \"Beyond the Reef\"), and six additional albums (on the Decca label) through 1968. He also recorded the album \"Yes Sirree!\" and the &lt;a href=\"instrumental\"&gt;instrumental&lt;/a&gt; album \"Trade Winds\", single-tracked on the &lt;a href=\"Hammond%20organ\"&gt;Hammond organ&lt;/a&gt; and piano, featuring the love theme from the film \"&lt;a href=\"El%20Cid%20%28film%29\"&gt;El Cid&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chaplin\"&gt;Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Eternally%20%28Charles%20Chaplin%20song%29\"&gt;Eternally&lt;/a&gt;\". This album featured some realistic-sounding \"tropical bird calls\" produced by his electric organ. \"House of Bamboo\" was another big-selling single. Grant recorded 30 albums for Decca, mostly on the Brunswick label, a subsidiary of Decca.\nSeveral of his albums featured tenor saxophonist &lt;a href=\"Plas%20Johnson\"&gt;Plas Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrant also made a few appearances in films and on television, including \"&lt;a href=\"Tender%20Is%20the%20Night%20%281962%20film%29\"&gt;Tender Is the Night&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962), \"&lt;a href=\"Juke%20Box%20Rhythm\"&gt;Juke Box Rhythm&lt;/a&gt;\" (1959), \"&lt;a href=\"It%20Takes%20a%20Thief%20%281968%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;It Takes a Thief&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show\"&gt;The Ed Sullivan Show&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960).\nGrant sang the title theme for the 1959 film \"&lt;a href=\"Imitation%20of%20Life%20%281959%20film%29\"&gt;Imitation of Life&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe died instantly in a car accident in &lt;a href=\"Lordsburg%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Lordsburg, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 39 when the car he was driving ran off &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010\"&gt;Interstate 10&lt;/a&gt;. He was driving from Los Angeles to an intended destination in &lt;a href=\"Juarez%2C%20Mexico\"&gt;Juarez, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, for an appearance at the La Fiesta nightclub. His cousin's 17-year-old son, Roosevelt Woods III, was also killed in the accident.\nFurther reading.\nMichel Ruppli, \"The Decca labels: A discography\" (Greenwood Press, 1996)"
