It is currently used mostly for &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches and was the home stadium of &lt;a href=\"YoungHeart%20Manawatu\"&gt;YoungHeart Manawatu&lt;/a&gt; before they disbanded. The stadium has a capacity of 8,000 people.\nThe stadium hosted the final of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Chatham%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Chatham Cup&lt;/a&gt; on 28 August 2011. &lt;a href=\"Wairarapa%20United\"&gt;Wairarapa United&lt;/a&gt; won the competition for the first time in their history, defeating &lt;a href=\"Napier%20City%20Rovers%20FC\"&gt;Napier City Rovers&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131. This is the first time that the final of New Zealand's premier knockout football competition has been held in Palmerston North.\nIn 2015 Central Football board member Bruce McGhie proposed a plan to the &lt;a href=\"Palmerston%20North%20City%20Council\"&gt;Palmerston North City Council&lt;/a&gt; on making the ground an all-weather sports field. He stated that by 2019\u201320 Memorial Park would have a multi-purpose artificial sports field. The plan is set to cost $1.7 million."
