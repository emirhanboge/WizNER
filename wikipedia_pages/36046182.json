    "text": "Joseph Anderson Panton (2 June 1831 \u2013 25 October 1913) was a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt;-born &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n magistrate and goldfields commissioner.\nPanton was born in &lt;a href=\"Knockiemil\"&gt;Knockiemil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aberdeenshire\"&gt;Aberdeenshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, the son of John Panton (of the Hudson's Bay Company service) and his wife Alexina McKay, \"n\u00e9e\" Anderson. Joseph Panton was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Scottish Naval and Military Academy&lt;/a&gt;, developing an interest in drawing. He later studied geology amongst other subjects at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, but did not finish a degree.\nPanton's uncle, Colonel Joseph Anderson, suggested that he migrate to Australia; Panton arrived in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Arbuthnot%20%28ship%29\"&gt;\"Thomas Arbuthnot\"&lt;/a&gt; in March 1851. He then went to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20District\"&gt;Port Phillip District&lt;/a&gt;. After farming briefly at &lt;a href=\"Mangalore%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Mangalore&lt;/a&gt;, Panton tried for gold without luck at &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Mount%20Alexander\"&gt;Mount Alexander&lt;/a&gt;. Then Panton applied for a position as an officer in the gold escort and was appointed assistant commissioner in 1852 at Kangaroo Gully near &lt;a href=\"Bendigo%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Bendigo, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. A year later he was senior assistant commissioner at Bendigo and then senior commissioner in 1854.\nPanton investigated resentment against the Chinese gold-diggers and recommended a Chinese protectorate; this was adopted by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Hotham\"&gt;Governor Charles Hotham&lt;/a&gt; in 1855. Panton had helped to organize the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20world%27s%20fairs\"&gt;Melbourne Exhibition in 1854&lt;/a&gt; and was a commissioner for the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20International%20Exhibition%20%281880%29\"&gt;Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1858, Panton went to Scotland and then to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; to study art with a friend of his, &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20de%20Castella\"&gt;Hubert de Castella&lt;/a&gt;. On Panton's return to Australia, he was appointed warden and magistrate at the Jamieson-Wood's Point and next at the Anderson's Creek goldfields. Panton then became magistrate at Heidelberg, where he also mapped the &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20Valley\"&gt;Yarra Valley&lt;/a&gt;, naming Panton Hill. Panton's Gap where the road to Ben Cairn and Donna Buang branches from the Don Road near &lt;a href=\"Healesville%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Healesville, Victoria&lt;/a&gt; derives its name from a small house he had there. He also named &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Donna%20Buang\"&gt;Mount Donna Buang&lt;/a&gt; which he first called Mount Acland but renamed it after learning the Aboriginal name. From Heidelberg, Panton was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Geelong\"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt; and moved to Melbourne as senior magistrate from 1874 to 1907.\nPanton was active in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Artists%20Association\"&gt;Victorian Artists Association&lt;/a&gt; and the Victorian Academy of Art which developed into the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Artists%20Society\"&gt;Victorian Artists Society&lt;/a&gt;. A fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society&lt;/a&gt; (London), Panton was also vice-president of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Geographical%20Society%20of%20Australasia\"&gt;Royal Geographical Society of Australasia&lt;/a&gt;, Victorian Branch.\nIn 1895 Panton declined the honour of knighthood but was appointed Companion of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George\"&gt;Order of St Michael and St George&lt;/a&gt; (CMG). Predeceased by his wife, he died at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;St. Kilda, Victoria&lt;/a&gt; on 25 October 1913 and was survived by two daughters, one of whom, Alice, was a well-known portrait painter.\nIn 1882, the Victorian government botanist, &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller\"&gt;Ferdinand von Mueller&lt;/a&gt; named a newly described plant from Western Australia, \"&lt;a href=\"Eremophila%20pantonii\"&gt;Eremophila pantonii&lt;/a&gt;\" in his honour."
