His father, a taxi driver, died when Amir was only thirteen years old. He began his career in the late 1970s after passing a technical test for &lt;a href=\"Rah%20Ahan%20F.C.\"&gt;Rah Ahan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the oldest clubs in the Iranian football. He played for the club's youth team for two years and was promoted to the first team squad in 1981 by &lt;a href=\"Nasser%20Ebrahimi\"&gt;Nasser Ebrahimi&lt;/a&gt;. He had a good performance there and scored three goals during the domestic Tehran Hazfi cup. Ghalenoei left the club after the club's head coach signed for &lt;a href=\"Shahin%20F.C.\"&gt;Shahin&lt;/a&gt;.\nShahin.\nWhen Ebrahimi became &lt;a href=\"Shahin%20F.C.\"&gt;Shahin&lt;/a&gt;'s coach, Ghalenoei moved to Shahin along with him. Shahin had several national players such as &lt;a href=\"Nasrollah%20Abdollahi\"&gt;Nasrollah Abdollahi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehdi%20Dinvarzadeh\"&gt;Mehdi Dinvarzadeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamid%20Majd%20Teymouri\"&gt;Hamid Majd Teymouri&lt;/a&gt;. Ebrahimi left the club in 1984, succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Mehrab%20Shahrokhi\"&gt;Mehrab Shahrokhi&lt;/a&gt; who was the head coach for a short period before being replaced by Nasrollah Abdollahi. Ghalenoei became the club's captain after the retirement of Dinvarzadeh. During his time in Shahin, he helped the team to finish as runner-up in two &lt;a href=\"Tehran%20Football%20Competitions\"&gt;Tehran leagues&lt;/a&gt; in 1985 and 1986.\nHe played his last match for Shahin in a 2\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"Persepolis%20F.C.\"&gt;Persepolis&lt;/a&gt; where both goals were on Ghalenoei's assists. He left the team in the middle of the 1987\u201388 season and signed with the Qatari club of &lt;a href=\"Al-Sadd\"&gt;Al-Sadd&lt;/a&gt;.\nAl-Sadd.\nHe signed a one-and-a-half years contract with &lt;a href=\"Al-Sadd\"&gt;Al-Sadd&lt;/a&gt; in 1987. He helped his side to two domestic league title and one &lt;a href=\"Emir%20of%20Qatar\"&gt;Emir of Qatar&lt;/a&gt; (FA Cup) title.

However Ghalenoei had already left the club and returned to Iran, and thus was not a member of the Asian champions squad.\nEsteghlal.\nHe joined &lt;a href=\"Esteghlal%20F.C.\"&gt;Esteghlal&lt;/a&gt; in July 1989 and played for the club until his retirement. He made his debut in a game against &lt;a href=\"Persepolis%20F.C.\"&gt;Persepolis&lt;/a&gt; in a quarter final &lt;a href=\"Hazfi%20Cup\"&gt;Hazfi Cup&lt;/a&gt; match where he lost his penalty kick.\nHe won the Iran league title in his first full season (1989\u201390) at the club in spring 1990. Esteghlal also won the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Club%20Championship\"&gt;Asian Club Championship&lt;/a&gt; on the following season (1990\u201391) after nearly twenty years.\nGhalenoei lost most of the next season (1991\u201392) due to a heavy injury. At that season, Esteghlal could not obtain an entry to the next season (1992\u201393) of Azadegan league and thus was asked to play in the &lt;a href=\"Iran%20Football%27s%203rd%20Division\"&gt;3rd Division&lt;/a&gt; for one season. This meant the departure of many players like &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Reza%20Abedzadeh\"&gt;Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shahrokh%20Bayani\"&gt;Shahrokh Bayani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majid%20Namjoo-Motlagh\"&gt;Majid Namjoo-Motlagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samad%20Marfavi\"&gt;Samad Marfavi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reza%20Ahadi\"&gt;Reza Ahadi&lt;/a&gt; but Ghalenoei remained at the team and was chosen as the club's new captain. Esteghlal again rose to the top level of Iranian football in 1994\u201395 and was ranked second on their first season back to the competition. Ghalenoei also scored twice in the final game of the following season (1995\u201396) &lt;a href=\"Hazfi%20Cup\"&gt;Hazfi Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In his last season in Esteghlal, they started off successfully both in the Iranian and Asian Cup Winners' Cup, but could not sustain the good performance. Their head coach, &lt;a href=\"Mansour%20Pourheidari\"&gt;Mansour Pourheidari&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 who had the club to the Asian glory \u2013 resigned mid season and &lt;a href=\"Nasser%20Hejazi\"&gt;Nasser Hejazi&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the head coach and finished the league with sixth position. He retired at the end of this season after missing many matches due to injury.\nHe was the captain of Esteghlal in the last four years of his career, known as \"General\", a title bestowed on him by fans due to his outstanding skills in leading the team during his career as the club.\nInternational career.\nHe was first invited to Iran national B football team in 1985 by &lt;a href=\"Nasser%20Ebrahimi\"&gt;Nasser Ebrahimi&lt;/a&gt;, a coach that he began his career with, and showed a good performance. He was invited on following year to the national team by &lt;a href=\"Parviz%20Dehdari\"&gt;Parviz Dehdari&lt;/a&gt; and made his debut against &lt;a href=\"China%20PR%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;China PR&lt;/a&gt;. However, he missed several international tournaments despite his good performance. For example, when he played in Al-Sadd, he was not invited to the national team squad for &lt;a href=\"1988%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1988 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; because he was a member of a foreign club. For the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1990 Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; held in Beijing, he was not invited because there several talented players in position he played. He was also injured before the &lt;a href=\"1992%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1992 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; and missed it.\nHe was invited to &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iran national football team&lt;/a&gt; again in 1993 by &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Parvin\"&gt;Ali Parvin&lt;/a&gt; and played against &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; on 12 September 1993. He also played in final round of &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; Qualification (in Qatar) and performed well especially against &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. His last national match was against &lt;a href=\"Oman%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. He captained Iran for one cap and scored one goal against Kuwait.\nGhalenoei was injured several times during his playing career, first in 1992 and the second in 1996 that was very strenuous and forced him to retire form football. This injury is still with him and he had several surgeries in his post-playing career.\nManagerial career.\nKeshavarz and Bargh Tehran.\nGhalenoei is the first Iranian football manager who passed &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; managerial class after taking Europe grade C at &lt;a href=\"Bayer%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt; football club six-month earlier.\nHis first managerial experience was with &lt;a href=\"Keshavarz%20F.C.\"&gt;Keshavarz&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 but was unsuccessful. He was later in charge of an &lt;a href=\"Azadegan%20League\"&gt;Azadegan League&lt;/a&gt; side, &lt;a href=\"Bargh%20Tehran%20F.C.\"&gt;Bargh Tehran&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 to 2002 where he could not lead his team to the promotion play-off, despite collecting 31 points in 20 matches.

However, he left the team before the season started and joined &lt;a href=\"Esteghlal%20Ahvaz\"&gt;Esteghlal Ahvaz&lt;/a&gt; in the 5th week of the 2002\u201303 league.\nHe was appointed as head coach of Esteghlal Ahvaz in the &lt;a href=\"Iran%20Pro%20League\"&gt;Iran Pro League&lt;/a&gt; in November 2002 to keep the club in the league.

He succeeded &lt;a href=\"Mansour%20Pourheidari\"&gt;Mansour Pourheidari&lt;/a&gt; who Ghalenoei was his assistant for the years.
