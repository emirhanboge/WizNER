    "text": "Menin Gate at Midnight (also known as Ghosts of Menin Gate) is a &lt;a href=\"1927%20in%20art\"&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt; painting by Australian artist &lt;a href=\"Will%20Longstaff\"&gt;Will Longstaff&lt;/a&gt;. The painting depicts a host of ghostly soldiers marching across a field in front of the &lt;a href=\"Menin%20Gate\"&gt;Menin Gate&lt;/a&gt; war memorial. The painting is part of the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.\nLongstaff painted the work after attending the unveiling of the Menin Gate memorial, at &lt;a href=\"Ypres\"&gt;Ypres&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium, on 24 July 1927. The memorial commemorated those men of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, including Australia, who died in the battles of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and have no known grave. Walking around the streets of Ypres after the ceremony, Longstaff was said to have seen a \"vision of steel-helmeted spirits rising from the moonlit cornfields around him\". Returning to London, Longstaff was reported to have painted the work in a single session, while \"still under psychic influence\".\nThe painting was immediately popular. It was purchased by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woolavington\"&gt;Lord Woolavington&lt;/a&gt; for 2,000 &lt;a href=\"guinea%20%28British%20coin%29\"&gt;guinea&lt;/a&gt;s and presented to the Australian government. After a royal command viewing at Buckingham Palace for &lt;a href=\"George%20V\"&gt;George V&lt;/a&gt; and the Royal family, the painting was displayed in Manchester and Glasgow. It was then taken around Australia, where record crowds paid to view the work. Longstaff oversaw the making of 2,000 prints, and 400 of those were given to the nascent &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to sell to raise funds.\nThe success of this work led Longstaff to paint three later companion pieces with a similar ghostly, spiritualist theme:"
