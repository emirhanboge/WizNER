On the penultimate backstretch, Praught moved past Coneo. &lt;a href=\"Nikki%20Hiltz\"&gt;Nikki Hiltz&lt;/a&gt; used that cue to move from the back of the pack up to Efraimson's back, immediately behind Praught. As they approached the bell, then around the turn, Hiltz moved around Efraimson and into a marking position on Praught's shoulder. Cuneo tried to stay with the leaders until 200 to go when the top 3 made a break. With 100 meters to go, Hiltz put on a burst of speed and the race was over.
