    "text": "Diakopto railway station () is a &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Diakopto\"&gt;Diakopto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Achaea\"&gt;Achaea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. It is located just North of village. It was opened 10 March 1896. It was reopened on 22 June 2020 as part of the \u20ac848-million &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;ErgOSE&lt;/a&gt; project extension of the &lt;a href=\"Athens%20Airport%E2%80%93Patras%20railway\"&gt;Athens Airport\u2013Patras railway&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aigio%20railway%20station\"&gt;Aigio&lt;/a&gt; rail line, co-financed by the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cohesion%20Fund\"&gt;Cohesion Fund&lt;/a&gt; 2000\u20132006. The station is served by both &lt;a href=\"Diakopto%E2%80%93Kalavryta%20railway\"&gt;Diakopto\u2013Kalavryta railway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athens%20Airport%E2%80%93Patras%20railway\"&gt;Line 5&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Proastiakos%20Athens\"&gt;Proastiakos Athens&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Athens%20railway%20station\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aigio%20railway%20station\"&gt;Aigio&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Station opened on 10 March 1896, on what was a &lt;a href=\"branch%20line\"&gt;branch line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Piraeus%2C%20Athens%20and%20Peloponnese%20Railways\"&gt;Piraeus, Athens &amp; Peloponnese Railways&lt;/a&gt; (SPAP) when the gauge line was completed in 1895. The line opened under the government of &lt;a href=\"Theodoros%20Diligiannis\"&gt;Theodoros Diligiannis&lt;/a&gt; however, work had been begun by the &lt;a href=\"Charilaos%20Trikoupis\"&gt;Charilaos Trikoupis&lt;/a&gt; government, under the grand project of connecting all of Greece by rail. The French company ATON with Italian craftsmen's assistant, who had acquired great experience in similar projects in the Alps, built the line. The construction of the network began in 1889 and was completed in 1895. Due to growing debts, the &lt;a href=\"Piraeus%2C%20Athens%20and%20Peloponnese%20Railways\"&gt;SPAP&lt;/a&gt; came under government control between 1939 and 1940. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Axis occupation of Greece&lt;/a&gt; (1941-44), Athens was controlled by German military forces, and the line used for the transport of troops and weapons. During the occupation (and especially during German withdrawal in 1944), the network was severely damaged by both the German army and Greek resistance groups. The track and rolling stock replacement took time following the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, with normal service levels resumed around 1948.\nIn 1954 &lt;a href=\"Piraeus%2C%20Athens%20and%20Peloponnese%20Railways\"&gt;SPAP&lt;/a&gt; was nationalized once more. In 1962 the &lt;a href=\"Piraeus%2C%20Athens%20and%20Peloponnese%20Railways\"&gt;SPAP&lt;/a&gt; was amalgamated into &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20State%20Railways\"&gt;SEK&lt;/a&gt;. In 1970 &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;OSE&lt;/a&gt; became the legal successor to the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20State%20Railways\"&gt;SEK&lt;/a&gt;, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971 the station, and most of the Greek rail infrastructure was transferred to the \"&lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.&lt;/a&gt;\", a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. \nIn 2001 the infrastructure element of OSE was created, known as GAIAOSE, it would henceforth be responsible for the maintenance, of stations, bridges and other elements of the network, as well as the leasing and the sale of railway assists. In 2003, OSE launched \"Proastiakos SA\", as a subsidiary to serve the operation of the suburban network in the urban complex of Athens during the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;2004 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, TrainOSE was created as a brand within OSE to concentrate on rail services and passenger interface.\nBetween 2007 and 2009 the entire rails and cog sections of the &lt;a href=\"Diakopto%E2%80%93Kalavryta%20railway\"&gt;Cog Railway&lt;/a&gt; were completely replaced, and four new modern trains were constructed to replace the older carriages. In 2008, all Proastiakos were transferred from OSE to TrainOSE. In 2009, with the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20government-debt%20crisis\"&gt;Greek debt crisis&lt;/a&gt; unfolding &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;OSE&lt;/a&gt;'s Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads, this included all passenger and freight services on the metre gauge railway system in the Peloponnese in 2011.\nHowever, Diakopto remained open, serving the &lt;a href=\"Diakopto%E2%80%93Kalavryta%20railway\"&gt;Cog Railway&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017 &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;OSE&lt;/a&gt;'s passenger transport sector was privatised as &lt;a href=\"TrainOSE\"&gt;TrainOSE&lt;/a&gt;, currently, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. In 2018 work to incorporated the station into the &lt;a href=\"Athens%20Airport%E2%80%93Patras%20railway\"&gt;Athens Airport\u2013Patras railway&lt;/a&gt;, linking it with Athens via a more direct rout on &lt;a href=\"Standard-gauge%20railway\"&gt;Standard gauge&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019 services were suspended due to a landslide. The Station was reopened 22 June 2020 by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Infrastructure%20and%20Transport%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Minister of Transport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kostas%20Karamanlis\"&gt;Kostas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt;. as part of the \u20ac848-million &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation\"&gt;ErgOSE&lt;/a&gt; project extension of the &lt;a href=\"Athens%20Airport%E2%80%93Patras%20railway\"&gt;Athens Airport\u2013Patras railway&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aigio%20railway%20station\"&gt;Aigio&lt;/a&gt; railline co-financed by the European Union's Cohesion Fund 2000\u20132006. This re-established direct rail links with Athens via the &lt;a href=\"Proastiakos%20Athens\"&gt;Proastiakos&lt;/a&gt; or suburban railway.\nFacilities.\nThere is level access from the small car park at the front of the station. It has two &lt;a href=\"Island%20platform\"&gt;Island platform&lt;/a&gt;s, with station buildings located at the platform level. The Station buildings are equipped only with a waiting area. At platform level, there are sheltered seating and &lt;a href=\"Dot-matrix%20display\"&gt;Dot-matrix display&lt;/a&gt; departure and arrival screens and timetable poster boards on both platforms. It is equipped with CCTV systems, Fire Detection systems &amp; &lt;a href=\"Honeywell\"&gt;Honeywell Security&lt;/a&gt; Systems. Currently, there is no local bus stop connecting the station.\nServices.\nThe station is served the following lines of the &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Proastiakos%20Athens\"&gt;Proastiakos&lt;/a&gt; or suburban railway:\n&lt;a href=\"Athens%20Airport%E2%80%93Patras%20railway\"&gt;Line 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aigio%20railway%20station\"&gt;Aigio&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Athens%20railway%20station\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; with 1 tph.
