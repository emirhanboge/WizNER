    "text": "Old Ralston Park was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; ground in &lt;a href=\"Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire\"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Abercorn%20F.C.\"&gt;Abercorn&lt;/a&gt; during their second decade in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAbercorn moved to the ground in 1899 from &lt;a href=\"Underwood%20Park%20%28Paisley%29\"&gt;Underwood Park&lt;/a&gt;. Two stands were built on either side of the pitch, one covered and one uncovered, with a pavilion brought from Underwood Park (which had also previously been moved from Blackstoun Park when Abercorn relocated to Underwood Park in 1889) erected in the north-west corner of the site. There were also embankments on the eastern side of the pitch.\nThe first league match was played at Old Ralston Park on 26 August 1899 when Abercorn beat &lt;a href=\"Leith%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Leith Athletic&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130. The probable record attendance was set on 9 February 1901 for a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Qualifying%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Qualifying Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final against &lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark%20A.C.\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt; when 5,000 saw Abercorn beaten 1\u20130.\nIn 1909 the club moved to a site directly to the west of Old Ralston Park, which became known as &lt;a href=\"New%20Ralston%20Park\"&gt;New Ralston Park&lt;/a&gt;. The final league match at Old Ralston Park was played on 20 March 1909, with Abercorn beating &lt;a href=\"Ayr%20Parkhouse%20F.C.\"&gt;Ayr Parkhouse&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20130. The site was subsequently used as a &lt;a href=\"clay%20pit\"&gt;clay pit&lt;/a&gt; by the adjacent &lt;a href=\"brickworks\"&gt;brickworks&lt;/a&gt;."
