    "text": "The Birds of &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Island\"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; form a heterogeneous group of 162 species. There is a core group of 4 &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemics&lt;/a&gt; that have evolved on the remote island in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, attended by a suite of regular migrants, opportunists and occasional visitors. Some 200\u00a0km from the nearest land, &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, Christmas Island was not occupied by humans until the late 19th century. It is now an &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n territory. The natural vegetation of most of the 140\u00a0km\u00b2 island is &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;, to which the endemic landbirds are adapted, while the &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt;s have taken advantage of a breeding location which had no major natural predators.\nThis list's &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Clements%20Checklist%20of%20Birds%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&lt;/a&gt;\", 2021 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Christmas Island.\nAfter over a century of human exploitation of the &lt;a href=\"phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt; deposits covering much of the island, two thirds of the rainforest cover remains and is now protected as a &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;. However, gaps where the forest has been cleared, and the introduction of exotic fauna, continue to destabilise the island's &lt;a href=\"biological%20diversity\"&gt;biological diversity&lt;/a&gt;. The endemic &lt;a href=\"Abbott%27s%20booby\"&gt;Abbott's booby&lt;/a&gt; is threatened when nesting by wind turbulence caused by past forest clearance. However, the biggest immediate threat is the introduction and spread of &lt;a href=\"yellow%20crazy%20ant\"&gt;yellow crazy ant&lt;/a&gt;s, through both direct predation and &lt;a href=\"ecosystem%20collapse\"&gt;ecosystem collapse&lt;/a&gt;. This has led to all the island's endemic bird species and subspecies being classified as &lt;a href=\"Critically%20Endangered\"&gt;Critically Endangered&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the number of species recorded from Christmas Island continues to increase as &lt;a href=\"birder\"&gt;birder&lt;/a&gt;s, especially from Australia, attracted by the island's endemics, record a variety of vagrants previously unnoticed. Some of these may in time, as with the &lt;a href=\"white-breasted%20waterhen\"&gt;white-breasted waterhen&lt;/a&gt;, establish breeding populations. Christmas Island is now seen as a birding \u2018hot spot\u2019, not only for its endemics but also for the chance of recording new species for the Australian bird list, something reflected in the frequency of submissions of sightings to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australasian%20Ornithologists%20Union\"&gt;Birds Australia&lt;/a&gt; Rarities Committee.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anatidae\"&gt;Anatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nAnatidae includes the &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as &lt;a href=\"Goose\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swan\"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.\nPheasants, grouse, and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phasianidae\"&gt;Phasianidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds. In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings.\nFlamingos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phoenicopteriformes\"&gt;Phoenicopteriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phoenicopteridae\"&gt;Phoenicopteridae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flamingo\"&gt;Flamingo&lt;/a&gt;s are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.\nPigeons and doves.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Columbiformes\"&gt;Columbiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;Columbidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pigeon\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dove\"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy &lt;a href=\"cere\"&gt;cere&lt;/a&gt;.\nCuckoos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Cuculiformes\"&gt;Cuculiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cuculidae\"&gt;Cuculidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Cuculidae includes &lt;a href=\"cuckoo\"&gt;cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Geococcyx\"&gt;roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ani%20%28bird%29\"&gt;anis&lt;/a&gt;. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are &lt;a href=\"brood%20parasite\"&gt;brood parasite&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNightjars and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgidae\"&gt;Caprimulgidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightjar\"&gt;Nightjar&lt;/a&gt;s are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.\nSwifts.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Apodidae\"&gt;Apodidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\nRails, gallinules, and coots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;Rallidae&lt;/a&gt;\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crake\"&gt;crake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coot\"&gt;coot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;gallinule&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\nStilts and avocets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Recurvirostridae\"&gt;Recurvirostridae&lt;/a&gt;\nRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the &lt;a href=\"avocet\"&gt;avocet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stilt\"&gt;stilt&lt;/a&gt;s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.\nOystercatchers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Haematopodidae\"&gt;Haematopodidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"oystercatcher\"&gt;oystercatcher&lt;/a&gt;s are large and noisy &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlovers and lapwings.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Charadriidae\"&gt;Charadriidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Charadriidae includes the &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dotterel\"&gt;dotterel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lapwing\"&gt;lapwing&lt;/a&gt;s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\nSandpipers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scolopacidae\"&gt;Scolopacidae&lt;/a&gt;\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the &lt;a href=\"sandpiper\"&gt;sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curlew\"&gt;curlew&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"godwit\"&gt;godwit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tringa\"&gt;shanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tattler%20%28bird%29\"&gt;tattler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodcock\"&gt;woodcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snipe\"&gt;snipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dowitcher\"&gt;dowitcher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phalarope\"&gt;phalarope&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\nPratincoles and coursers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Glareolidae\"&gt;Glareolidae&lt;/a&gt;\nGlareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the &lt;a href=\"pratincole\"&gt;pratincole&lt;/a&gt;s, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the &lt;a href=\"courser\"&gt;courser&lt;/a&gt;s, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.\nSkuas and jaegers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Stercorariidae\"&gt;Stercorariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.\nGulls, terns, and skimmers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Laridae\"&gt;Laridae&lt;/a&gt;\nLaridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tern\"&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skimmer%20%28bird%29\"&gt;skimmer&lt;/a&gt;s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.\nTropicbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontiformes\"&gt;Phaethontiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontidae\"&gt;Phaethontidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tropicbird\"&gt;Tropicbird&lt;/a&gt;s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.\nSouthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Oceanitidae\"&gt;Oceanitidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe southern storm-petrels are relatives of the &lt;a href=\"petrel\"&gt;petrel&lt;/a&gt;s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on &lt;a href=\"plankton\"&gt;plankton&lt;/a&gt;ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;-like.\nNorthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Hydrobatidae\"&gt;Hydrobatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThough the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.\nShearwaters and petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Procellariidae\"&gt;Procellariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.\nFrigatebirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Fregatidae\"&gt;Fregatidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Frigatebird\"&gt;Frigatebird&lt;/a&gt;s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\nBoobies and gannets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sulidae\"&gt;Sulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe sulids comprise the &lt;a href=\"gannet\"&gt;gannet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Booby\"&gt;boobies&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\nCormorants and shags.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phalacrocoracidae\"&gt;Phalacrocoracidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPhalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful.\nPelicans.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pelecanidae\"&gt;Pelecanidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pelican\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;s are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes.\nHerons, egrets, and bitterns.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ardeidae\"&gt;Ardeidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Ardeidae contains the &lt;a href=\"bittern\"&gt;bittern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"egret\"&gt;egret&lt;/a&gt;s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.\nIbises and spoonbills.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Pelecaniformes\"&gt;Pelecaniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Threskiornithidae\"&gt;Threskiornithidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThreskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"ibis\"&gt;ibis&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"spoonbill\"&gt;spoonbill&lt;/a&gt;s. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.\nHawks, eagles, and kites.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Accipitriformes\"&gt;Accipitriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Accipitridae\"&gt;Accipitridae&lt;/a&gt;\nAccipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes &lt;a href=\"hawk\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kite%20%28bird%29\"&gt;kites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrier%20%28bird%29\"&gt;harriers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20World%20vulture\"&gt;Old World vulture&lt;/a&gt;s. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.\nOwls.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Strigiformes\"&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Strigidae\"&gt;Strigidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"typical%20owl\"&gt;typical owl&lt;/a&gt;s are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey.

They share the colourful appearance of those groups with blues and browns predominating. The two inner front toes are connected, but the outer toe is not.\nFalcons and caracaras.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Falconiformes\"&gt;Falconiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Falconidae\"&gt;Falconidae&lt;/a&gt;\nFalconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.\nPittas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pittidae\"&gt;Pittidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPittas are medium-sized by passerine standards and are stocky, with fairly long, strong legs, short tails and stout bills. Many are brightly coloured. They spend the majority of their time on wet forest floors, eating snails, insects and similar invertebrates.\nShrikes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Laniidae\"&gt;Laniidae&lt;/a&gt;\nShrikes are passerine birds known for their habit of catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A typical shrike's beak is hooked, like a bird of prey.\nReed warblers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Acrocephalidae\"&gt;Acrocephalidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe members of this family are usually rather large for \"warblers\". Most are rather plain olivaceous brown above with much yellow to beige below. They are usually found in open woodland, reedbeds, or tall grass. The family occurs mostly in southern to western Eurasia and surroundings, but it also ranges far into the Pacific, with some species in Africa.\nGrassbirds and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Passeriformes\"&gt;Passeriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Locustellidae\"&gt;Locustellidae&lt;/a&gt;\nLocustellidae are a family of small insectivorous songbirds found mainly in Eurasia, Africa, and the Australian region.
