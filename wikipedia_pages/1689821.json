    "text": "Funaria is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of approximately 210 species of &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;. \"Funaria hygrometrica\" is the most common species. \"Funaria hygrometrica\" is called \u201ccord moss\u201d because of the twisted seta which is very hygroscopic and untwists when moist. The name is derived from the Latin word \u201cfunis\u201d, meaning \"a rope\". In funaria root like structures called &lt;a href=\"Rhizoid\"&gt;rhizoids&lt;/a&gt; are present.\nCapsules are abundant with the moss surviving as spore when conditions are not suitable.\nMoss plant Funaria grows in dense patches or cushions in moist shady and cool places during the &lt;a href=\"rainy%20season\"&gt;rainy season&lt;/a&gt;s. It has a height of 3\u20135\u00a0cm, a &lt;a href=\"radial%20symmetry\"&gt;radial symmetry&lt;/a&gt; with a differentiation of an axis or stem, leaves or phylloids are multicellular colorless branched &lt;a href=\"rhizoids\"&gt;rhizoids&lt;/a&gt; with oblique septa.\nThese are primitive multicellular, &lt;a href=\"autotrophic\"&gt;autotrophic&lt;/a&gt;, shade loving, amphibious plants. They reproduce by spore formation. They have no &lt;a href=\"vascular%20system\"&gt;vascular system&lt;/a&gt;. Root like structures called &lt;a href=\"rhizoids\"&gt;rhizoids&lt;/a&gt; are present. They show &lt;a href=\"alternation%20of%20generation\"&gt;alternation of generation&lt;/a&gt; i.e. the gametophytic stage alternates with the &lt;a href=\"sporophyte\"&gt;sporophytic&lt;/a&gt; stage.\nExternal structure of gametophyte.\nPlant body is gametophytic and consists of two stages: juvenile and adult. \nThe juvenile stage is represented by \"primary protonema\" (thread-like structures formed directly by spore germination).\nThe adult stage is represented by leafy gametophore which is differentiated into rhizoids, axis and leaves. Rhizoids arise from the base of the axis and they are slender, branched , obliquely septate and provides anchorage for the bryophyte. The axis is a stem-like structure arising from the rhizoid, long, slender, monopodially branched. The each branch is extra axilliary arising form the base of a leaf. The leaves are sessile, oblong-ovate with entire margin and pointed apex. Each leaf is transversed by a mid rib. Leaves are born spirally around the axis.\nMorphology.\nThe adult plant body is foliose gametophyte which is leafy and branced which is differentiated into axis, leaves, rhizoids.\nAxis/Stem: Small, erect, upright, slender, monopodially branched\nLeaves: Spirally arranged around the axis. Flat, green with a well-defined mid-rib. Lower leaves are smaller and scattered and upper leaves are large and crowded.\nRhizoids: Basal, branched, multicellular, obliquely septated mainly for absorption of minerals and anchorage to substratum.\nT.S. of axis.\nDivided into 3 regions: \nT.S of leaf.\nThe transverse section of the leaf shows a well-defined mid-rib with two lateral wings except in the mid-rib region. There are single-layered parenchymatous polygonal cells with prominent chloroplasts. The central part of the mid-rib has a narrow conducting strand of thick walled cells that helps in conduction. "
