The team played their second season, the &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Iraqi%20National%20League\"&gt;1976\u201377 season&lt;/a&gt;, in the league very badly and their results were disastrous, as it could not win any match, drawing three and lost all other matches, and finished in last place at the end of the season, but they were fortunate because that the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; decided not to relegate any club, which allowed the team to play a third season in the league. The third season, the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20Iraqi%20National%20League\"&gt;1977\u201378 season&lt;/a&gt;, did not bring anything new, as the team continued its poor results, winning one match, drawing two and losing all their other matches, and relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20Division%20One\"&gt;Iraq Division One&lt;/a&gt;."
