    "text": "The 2015\u201316 &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;Super League Greece&lt;/a&gt; was the 80th season of the highest tier in league of &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and the tenth under its current title. The season started on 22 August 2015 and ended in May 2016. The league comprised fourteen teams from the 2014\u201315 season and two promoted from the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;2014\u201315 Football League&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; won their sixth consecutive title and 43rd overall.\nTeams.\nFour teams were relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;2014\u201315 season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"PAE%20Kerkyra\"&gt;Kerkyra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ergotelis%20F.C.\"&gt;Ergotelis&lt;/a&gt; play in &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; for the 2015\u201316 season. &lt;a href=\"Niki%20Volos%20F.C.\"&gt;Niki Volos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"OFI%20Crete\"&gt;OFI&lt;/a&gt; will play in &lt;a href=\"Gamma%20Ethniki\"&gt;Gamma Ethniki&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo teams were promoted from the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;2014\u201315 Football League&lt;/a&gt;, champions &lt;a href=\"AEK%20Athens%20F.C.\"&gt;AEK Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iraklis%20F.C.%20%28Thessaloniki%29\"&gt;Iraklis&lt;/a&gt;, two teams with a long history in the top championship of Greece.\nRegular season.\nPositions by round.\nThe table lists the positions of teams after each week of matches. In order to preserve chronological evolvements, any postponed matches are not included in the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. For example, if a match is scheduled for matchday 13, but then postponed and played between days 16 and 17, it will be added to the standings for day 16.\nPlay-offs.\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the four qualified teams play each other in a home-and-away &lt;a href=\"Round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;round robin&lt;/a&gt;. However, they do not all start with 0 points: instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing in fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. Its end-of-season tally of points is then used to calculate the number of points with which the other teams will start the play-offs: more specifically, each of the three other teams participating in the play-offs will have the fifth-placed team's total points tally subtracted from their own points tally and then divided by five \u2013 giving the final figure.\nAttendances.\nAverage attendances counted officially without games played behind closed gates from Superleague.\n \n "
