After signing the deal, Cobb explained his thought process. \"At the end of the day, my heart was in Green Bay, and I knew that's where I wanted to be. I knew I had a good thing going for me, and still I signed a pretty lucrative deal that I can handle as far as making that last for the rest of my life.\" Cobb also mentioned that the NFC Championship loss to the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Seahawks\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; still bothered him. \"Obviously, that loss still hurts. It still feels fresh. I want to win a championship, and we were right there. We were close. We didn't do what we needed to do to win, but we have a lot of the guys coming back this year, same guys. A lot of our core guys, and we believe that puts us in the mix. So we have to handle business this offseason as far as continuing to get better on a daily basis. Obviously, next season, we have to put ourselves in position to go on a run.\"\nIn 2015, Cobb had one of his best seasons as teammate &lt;a href=\"Jordy%20Nelson\"&gt;Jordy Nelson&lt;/a&gt; went down with an ACL in the preseason, posting only six touchdowns.
