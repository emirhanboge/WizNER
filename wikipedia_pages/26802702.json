    "title": "Josef Newgarden",
    "text": "Josef Newgarden (born December 22, 1990) is an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; race car driver that competes in the &lt;a href=\"IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;IndyCar Series&lt;/a&gt; full-time for &lt;a href=\"Team%20Penske\"&gt;Team Penske&lt;/a&gt;. He is the 2017 and 2019 &lt;a href=\"IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;NTT Indycar Series&lt;/a&gt; Champion and 2011 &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Lights\"&gt;Indy Lights&lt;/a&gt; champion.\nCareer.\nKarting.\nNewgarden's first race vehicle was a &lt;a href=\"Motorized%20scooter\"&gt;Motorized scooter&lt;/a&gt; purchased at a skate shop in &lt;a href=\"Hendersonville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Hendersonville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. In 2001, Josef competed in events across the country. After a year of this, his father purchased a kart.\nWhen he was 13, he and his family ventured far outside of Tennessee to find a competitive &lt;a href=\"kart%20racing\"&gt;kart racing&lt;/a&gt; environment. This led Newgarden to a kart racing facility in &lt;a href=\"New%20Castle%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;New Castle, Indiana&lt;/a&gt; that had recently been launched by IndyCar driver &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Dismore\"&gt;Mark Dismore&lt;/a&gt;. In an order to stay efficient with funding, Newgarden would focus on local and regional championships rather than competing nationally.\nIn just his first year of karting (2005), Newgarden would finish 2nd and 3rd in the Kart Racers of America (KRA) Junior Can Championship. He would also compete in the TAG world championships that year in the junior division, securing the title.\nIn 2006, he would have his most successful year in karting, securing two championships in the KRA Junior Can division and repeating as the TAG World Champion in the junior division.\nHe would go on to compete in junior car racing in 2007 but would return to karting several times down the road, racing in the highly competitive Robo-Pong 200 at New Castle Motorsports Park several times over the next few years. He would win the 200-mile endurance race twice with both successes coming with members of the Dismore family as his teammates (Mark Dismore Sr in 2011 and Mark Dismore Jr in 2013).\nEarly Formula Car Racing.\nSkip Barber.\nNewgarden started his &lt;a href=\"Open-wheel%20car\"&gt;open-wheel&lt;/a&gt; car career in the &lt;a href=\"Skip%20Barber%20Racing%20School\"&gt;Skip Barber Racing School&lt;/a&gt; series in 2006. He finished as runner-up in the Southern Regional Series with three wins and another seven podium places. He next competed in the 2007 BFGoodrich / Skip Barber National Presented by Mazda championship, finishing sixth with two wins. Newgarden remained in the series for 2008 and improved to second place, with three wins.\nFormula Ford.\nAfter the 2008 season, Josef was selected for the Team USA scholarship to compete at the Formula Ford Festival and Walter Hayes Trophy. He would secure the Formula Ford Festival title, becoming the only American to ever do so.\nAt the Walter Hayes Trophy event, Josef would win all of the qualifying races leading to the main event. He would also start the event from the pole position. Unfortunately, mid-way through a rain-stricken race, Josef crashed from the lead, finishing 6th place.\nIn 2009, he would move to England to compete in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Formula%20Ford%20Championship\"&gt;British Formula Ford Championship&lt;/a&gt; and start his European career. He would finish runner-up in 2009, leading the series in total race wins and amassing 550 points.\nFormula Palmer Audi.\nNewgarden competed in the opening round of the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Formula%20Palmer%20Audi%20season\"&gt;2009 Formula Palmer Audi season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brands%20Hatch\"&gt;Brands Hatch&lt;/a&gt;, taking two wins and a fourth in the third race.\nGP3 Series.\nIn 2010, Newgarden competed in the newly formed &lt;a href=\"2010%20GP3%20Series%20season\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"GP3%20Series\"&gt;GP3 Series&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Carlin%20Motorsport\"&gt;Carlin Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;. 2010 would end in Josef's most disappointing championship position of his young career, finishing 18th in the points. The season was highlighted by a pole position at &lt;a href=\"Hockenheimring\"&gt;Hockenheimring&lt;/a&gt; and a best finish of fifth at the season finale at &lt;a href=\"Autodromo%20Nazionale%20di%20Monza\"&gt;Monza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndy Lights.\nAt the start of 2011, Josef would return home to the United States to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Indy%20Lights\"&gt;Indy Lights&lt;/a&gt; Series with &lt;a href=\"Schmidt%20Peterson%20Motorsports\"&gt;Sam Schmidt Motorsports&lt;/a&gt;. He won his first Indy Lights race in the season opener on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Streets of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. He followed his opening win in St. Petersburg with four more wins and ten podium finishes out of thirteen races in 2011, clinching him the points championship with one race to go. In New Hampshire, the 11th race of 2011, Newgarden lapped the entire field and went on to win. He was the first Indy Lights driver to do this since Thiago Medeiros in March 2004. Josef, as a rookie, would also lead the series with the most number of wins for the 2011 season.\nIndyCar.\n2012\u20132014: Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing.\nOn December 7, 2011, Newgarden was announced as the driver for &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Fisher%20Hartman%20Racing\"&gt;Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite rare in IndyCar for a rookie driver to be offered a multi-year contract but Sarah and her team saw promise in Josef. Sarah's team was viewed as the smallest outfit in the series and Josef was certainly headed for a significant challenge in his first entry into professional motorsport. He competed in IndyCar from 2012 to 2014 with Sarah Fisher's team, steadily progressing and improving with each weekend. He would earn his first podium at the 2013 race in Baltimore. 2014 would be his standout year with SFHR, he would very nearly secure wins at both &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and would stand on his second career podium at &lt;a href=\"2014%20Iowa%20Corn%20Indy%20300\"&gt;Iowa Speedway.&lt;/a&gt;\n2015: CFH Racing.\nDuring his fourth full season in IndyCar, Newgarden raced under the merged team of &lt;a href=\"CFH%20Racing\"&gt;Sarah Fisher and Ed Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;. Under this new team banner Newgarden started 2015 strong, finishing in 12th position at St. Petersburg and improving his position with each race.\nDuring the fourth race weekend in the 2015 season at &lt;a href=\"Barber%20Motorsports%20Park\"&gt;Barber Motorsports Park&lt;/a&gt;, Newgarden earned his first Indycar Series victory at the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Honda%20Indy%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;2015 Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, moving from 5th to 2nd on the first lap of the race, and leading the most laps on the way to a 2.2-second win.\nProving that his win wasn't luck he would win again later in the season at the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Honda%20Indy%20Toronto\"&gt;2015 Honda Indy Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and finished the 2015 season 7th in the standings with 431 points, a personal best in IndyCar.\n2016: Ed Carpenter Racing.\nSarah Fisher ended her participation in IndyCar after the 2015 season, leaving Newgarden to drive for the reformed &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Carpenter%20Racing\"&gt;Ed Carpenter Racing&lt;/a&gt;.\nNewgarden started the 2016 season strong with a podium at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Honda%20Indy%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;2016 Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Barber%20Motorsports%20Park\"&gt;Barber Motorsports Park&lt;/a&gt;. He barely missed pole position during qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;2016 Indy 500&lt;/a&gt; and started in the middle of the front row. He finished the 100th running of the Indy 500 in a strong 3rd.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Firestone%20600\"&gt;2016 Firestone 600&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Texas Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Newgarden crashed hard into the wall, breaking both his hand and clavicle. Remarkably, he returned to the car two weeks later, working his way to a top 10 spot at the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Kohler%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;2016 Kohler Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Road%20America\"&gt;Road America&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly 28 days after his crash at Texas, Newgarden won the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Iowa%20Corn%20300\"&gt;2016 Iowa Corn 300&lt;/a&gt; in dominating fashion, leading 282 of 300 laps. A remarkable achievement with a broken hand and shoulder.\nAt IndyCar's return to &lt;a href=\"Watkins%20Glen%20International\"&gt;Watkins Glen International&lt;/a&gt;, the 2016 Grand Prix at the Glen, Newgarden claimed another podium, finishing 2nd. After a 6th-place finish at the 2016 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma, he finished the season in fourth place overall in the season standings. In a testament to their hard work and success, Josef and ECR would finish the season as the highest non-Team Penske car in the series. A considerable feat for a small team.\n2017\u2013present: Team Penske.\nOn September 29, 2016, ECR owner &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Carpenter%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Ed Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Newgarden would not be back with the team in 2017. Newgarden moved to &lt;a href=\"Team%20Penske\"&gt;Team Penske&lt;/a&gt; for the 2017 season, with the team making an official announcement on October 5.\nNewgarden won his first race with Team Penske during round 3 of the 2017 season at Barber Motorsports Park; clinching the victory after a duel with Scott Dixon in the final laps. Newgarden moved into the IndyCar points lead following back to back victories at Toronto and Mid Ohio.\nAt Gateway, Newgarden held off his teammates and Scott Dixon to clinch his fourth series victory of the season but not without controversy as late in the race, Newgarden went under teammate &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Pagenaud\"&gt;Simon Pagenaud&lt;/a&gt; very late going into Turn 1. After bumping tires, both continued but, as Pagenaud nearly hit the wall, he was not pleased with his teammate's move. The following week at Watkins Glen, Newgarden had a sizable cushion in the points over second-place Dixon. Coming back onto the track after a pit stop under green on cold tires, he lost control of the car as &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais\"&gt;S\u00e9bastien Bourdais&lt;/a&gt; made contact with him damaging the suspension. Newgarden ended up leaving the Glen with a three-point lead, later a four-point lead as he won the pole for Sonoma, setting a track record. Newgarden needed to finish 4th or higher regardless of Pagenaud's result and he finished 2nd to clinch his first title. Newgarden became the first American born driver to win the &lt;a href=\"Astor%20Cup%20%28auto%20race%29\"&gt;Astor Cup&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Hunter-Reay\"&gt;Ryan Hunter-Reay&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nNewgarden won the opening race of the 2019 season at &lt;a href=\"Firestone%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; and followed that up with wins at &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Speedway\"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. He led the points standings after every race except the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indy 500&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Team%20Penske\"&gt;Team Penske&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Pagenaud\"&gt;Simon Pagenaud&lt;/a&gt; led from the pole position. Newgarden won his second IndyCar title at &lt;a href=\"WeatherTech%20Raceway%20Laguna%20Seca\"&gt;Laguna Seca&lt;/a&gt; by only 25 points.\nNewgarden started his second title defense slowly in &lt;a href=\"2020%20IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, a season shorted by the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Although he finished third at the opener in Texas he found himself in an early-season slump that put him in a hole to rival &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Dixon\"&gt;Scott Dixon&lt;/a&gt;. By mid-season and toward the final stretch he produced a series of wins and podium finishes that set him up for a title-deciding showdown with Dixon at the final round in St. Petersburg. Newgarden could only win the championship if he won the race and Dixon either retired or finished no better than ninth. During the race, Newgarden overtook &lt;a href=\"Pato%20O%27Ward\"&gt;Pato O'Ward&lt;/a&gt; in the closing laps after a restart and held onto the lead for his second consecutive win in St. Petersburg but ultimately failed to defend his title when Dixon finished third.\n&lt;a href=\"2021%20IndyCar%20Series\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; would be an up-and-down year for Newgarden and Team Penske. Despite earning a season leading four pole positions, he would not pick up a win until the tenth round of the season at Mid Ohio. The win was Newgarden's nineteenth in IndyCar, making him the most successful American driver currently active in the series. Newgarden picked up a second win at Gateway. Heading into the final race of the season at Long Beach, Newgarden was one of only three drivers mathematically in contention for the title alongside Alex Palou and Pato O'Ward. Newgarden finished second in the race, giving him a second-place finish in the championship for the second consecutive year.\nPersonal life.\nNewgarden was born in &lt;a href=\"Nashville\"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; to Joey and Tina Newgarden, who had moved from New York in the 1980s with the family &lt;a href=\"photography\"&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt; business. Josef is half &lt;a href=\"Danes\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; via his mother. He credits watching racing on TV at an early age with his father, who was an avid fan of NASCAR, IndyCar and Formula 1, as what got him into the sport.\nNewgarden grew up in &lt;a href=\"Hendersonville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Hendersonville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and attended &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II%20High%20School%20%28Tennessee%29\"&gt;Pope John Paul II High School&lt;/a&gt;, where he was friends with and a former classmate of &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Tate\"&gt;Golden Tate&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, he was a former classmate of NASCAR driver &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Berry\"&gt;Josh Berry&lt;/a&gt; in the 7th and 8th grades.\nBefore starting racing, Newgarden played baseball, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and basketball. \nOn October 7, 2018, Newgarden announced that he and his longtime girlfriend, Ashley Welch, had got engaged while on a trip to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Josef and Ashley were married in the fall of 2019 in Nashville, TN.\nMedia appearances.\nAlong with fellow racers &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kanaan\"&gt;Tony Kanaan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helio%20Castroneves\"&gt;Helio Castroneves&lt;/a&gt;, he competed in the Indianapolis round of season 8 of &lt;a href=\"American%20Ninja%20Warrior\"&gt;American Ninja Warrior&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.\nNewgarden is the driver ambassador for the &lt;a href=\"SeriousFun%20Children%27s%20Network\"&gt;SeriousFun Children's Network&lt;/a&gt;, a charity started by actor and race team owner &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Newman\"&gt;Paul Newman&lt;/a&gt;. Newgarden is also a talented ping-pong player. He hosts an annual celebrity tournament during May that raises funds for the Serious Fun Children's Network. In 2019, the tournament raised over $100,000 for the charity.\nNewgarden is an avid gamer and is currently a Brand Ambassador for the &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; title &lt;a href=\"Forza%20Motorsport\"&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;. His voice is featured in the game and he is frequently featured in Forza content.\nHe was featured on several episodes of &lt;a href=\"CMT%20%28American%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;CMT&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Nashville%20Squares\"&gt;Nashville Squares&lt;/a&gt; during the fall of 2019."
