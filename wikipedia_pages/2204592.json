    "text": "George Smith (born 14 July 1980) is a retired Australian &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player. He was a &lt;a href=\"Flanker%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;flanker&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Bears\"&gt;Bristol Bears&lt;/a&gt;, though he is more known for his 12 years (2000\u201310,13) at the &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Brumbies\"&gt;ACT Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, earning 142 caps.\nHe made his test debut in 2000 against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in Paris and earning 111 &lt;a href=\"Cap%20%28sport%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, 110 before retiring from international rugby on 5 February 2010 and one final cap against the &lt;a href=\"British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British &amp; Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July 2013. He is the second most capped Wallaby forward behind &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Sharpe\"&gt;Nathan Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;, and is the second most capped flanker in rugby union behind &lt;a href=\"Richie%20McCaw\"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and junior career.\nSmith was born in &lt;a href=\"Manly%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Manly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. He began playing rugby with the Manly Roos/Warringah Roos, before moving on to play the majority of his junior career with the Manly Vikings, and &lt;a href=\"Tupou%20College\"&gt;Tupou College&lt;/a&gt; in Tonga, playing a year above his age group in the Sydney junior rugby competition. Once that team had reached its age limit (18 years old) and moved on to the colts competition, Smith remained in the Sydney junior rugby competition, this time lining up in his correct age group for the Seaforth-Balgowlah Raiders.\nHe then progressed to playing in the &lt;a href=\"Manly%20RUFC\"&gt;Manly&lt;/a&gt; 1st grade Colts side who also won a premiership in 1999. It was during that season that Smith made his first grade debut at Nepean Rugby Park against The &lt;a href=\"Penrith%20Emus%20Rugby\"&gt;Penrith Emus&lt;/a&gt;. During his junior career he was selected for many representative teams, including Manly, Sydney, Northern Zone, NSW, and Australian Under 16s.\nSmith also had a successful school career, first at Balgowlah Boys High School, then at Cromer High School, where, along with Tongan international John Payne, he won the Australian Schools Championship. He played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1998.\nSenior career.\nBrumbies and Australia: 2000\u20132010.\nHe was signed to the &lt;a href=\"ACT%20Brumbies\"&gt;ACT Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Jones%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Eddie Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. He made his Super 12 debut in just his first year of professional rugby in 2000, playing against the &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Sharks\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, and he scored a try in the Brumbies Super 12 final loss to the Canterbury Crusaders. In a remarkable year, Smith was also capped for the first time in the Wallabies end of season tour against France.\nSmith was a key player for the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wallabies&lt;/a&gt; from 2000\u201309.\nHe was often voted Players' Player of the Year, awarded for fair-play by his teammates and officials. He has recently been chosen as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wallaby%20Team%20of%20the%20Decade\"&gt;Wallaby Team of the Decade&lt;/a&gt;, a remarkable feat considering his age and one of only three current players picked. In 2002, he was the first recipient of the &lt;a href=\"John%20Eales%20Medal\"&gt;John Eales Medal&lt;/a&gt;, awarded by the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Australian Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; and the Rugby Union Players' Association to their Player of the Year.\nHe won Australian Super 14 Player of the Year four years in a row between &lt;a href=\"2006%20Super%2014%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2009%20Super%2014%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2007 the breakdown specialist capped off another remarkable season claiming awards including: the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player for the fifth consecutive year; Super 14 Player of the Year; and the Rugby Union Players' Association 'Rugby Medal for Excellence'. These recognitions underlined his position as one of rugby's most respected players, reinforced further when he became the Wallabies 75th captain, against Canada at the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\n2008 was a big year for Smith. He captained the &lt;a href=\"Brumbies\"&gt;Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; and the Wallabies and became the first player to win the \"John Eales Medal\", twice. In addition, Smith won the \"Super 14 Player of the Year Award\", for the third consecutive year and the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player of the year for the sixth consecutive year.\nHe also reached a personal milestone during the season, when he made his 100th &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; appearance against the Cheetahs in round six. In a memorable double for the Smith family, George's younger brother, Brumbies teammate &lt;a href=\"Tyrone%20Smith%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Tyrone&lt;/a&gt;, was named rookie of the year. In the international arena, the older Smith also became both the most capped flanker and the most capped forward \u2013 the latter being previously held by &lt;a href=\"John%20Eales\"&gt;John Eales&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 5 February 2010, Smith announced his retirement from international rugby. &lt;a href=\"2010%20Super%2014%20season\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; was expected to be his last in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt;. Smith celebrated with the achievement of his 9th Brumbies Players' Player of the Year, with eight of those awards being consecutive.\nToulon, Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Suntory: 2011\u20132013.\nIn June 2010, Smith signed a one-year contract with French Top 14 club &lt;a href=\"Toulon%20Rugby\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt;. His RC Toulonnais teammates included former &lt;a href=\"Highlanders%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Highlander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"All%20Blacks\"&gt;All Black&lt;/a&gt; prop &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Hayman%23Toulon\"&gt;Carl Hayman&lt;/a&gt;, and former Brumbies' scrum-half &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Henjak%23Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Matt Henjak&lt;/a&gt;. Later in 2010 he was selected in the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;French Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; to play at blindside flanker (number 6) against &lt;a href=\"Tonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmith played for the Australia XV team alongside fellow Tongan, &lt;a href=\"Lisiate%20Tafa\"&gt;Lisiate Tafa&lt;/a&gt;, in the Southern Hemisphere Charity Fundraiser in March 2011 against the Pacific Barbarians.

This followed &lt;a href=\"Ita%20Vaea\"&gt;Ita Vaea&lt;/a&gt;'s season-ending injury. Smith gained the approval of his Japanese club Sungoliath for his 12-week stint back in Australia.\nSmith was recalled to the Australian squad in June that year for the series against the &lt;a href=\"2013%20British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia\"&gt;British &amp; Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt;, after recovering from a knee injury. After being overlooked for the second test, Smith was named as the starting open side flanker for the third and deciding test in Sydney. It was his first test since retiring from international rugby in February 2010 and broke &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Meads\"&gt;Colin Meads&lt;/a&gt;' record of 4382 days between his first test against the Lions, and his last.\nLyon and Wasps: 2014\u20132016.\nAfter leaving French club &lt;a href=\"Lyon%20OU\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; on their relegation to the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20D2\"&gt;Pro D2&lt;/a&gt;, Smith made a move to England to sign for &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;Wasps&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aviva%20Premiership\"&gt;Aviva Premiership&lt;/a&gt; from the 2015\u201316 season.
