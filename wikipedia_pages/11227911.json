    "text": "Deportivo Riestra Asociaci\u00f3n de Fomento Barrio Col\u00f3n, also known as Deportivo Riestra, is an &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sports%20club\"&gt;sports club&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. The club is mainly focused on &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, with the senior squad currently playing in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt;, the second division of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine league system&lt;/a&gt;. Besides, the &lt;a href=\"futsal\"&gt;futsal&lt;/a&gt; team plays in Primera D, the fourth tier division. Deportiva Riestra also has youth and &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20association%20football\"&gt;women's&lt;/a&gt; teams competing in different tournaments and divisions.\nThe club headquarters are located in the &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood, with Guillermo Laza Stadium of &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Soldati\"&gt;Villa Soldati&lt;/a&gt; as venue for football matches. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000. \nApart from football, Riestra is affiliated to the \"Federaci\u00f3n Metropolitana de Ajedrez\" (Metropolitan Chess Federation).\nHistory.\nInitial years.\nThe origins of Deportivo Riestra trace back to 1929, when a group of youths from &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt; formed a football team to compete in local tournaments. They became known as \"the Riestra ones\", due to the name of the avenue where they used to gather, right next to a milk store. On February 22, 1931 they formally founded the club, and they rented a place as headquarters later that year.\nRiestra affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1946, after negotiations by Pascual Tr\u00edmboli, then president of the club and later head of department in the Association. The Blanquinegro official debut was a 3\u20132 loss against &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20San%20Telmo\"&gt;San Telmo&lt;/a&gt;. Riestra played those years in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;, but they were later transferred to the new &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the founder squads of that division. In 1950 Riestra inaugurated its first stadium in the &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Soldati\"&gt;Villa Soldati&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood.\nFirst achievement and stay in Primera C.\nRiestra won its first official tournament in 1953, as &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; champions. The Blanquinegro squad earned 39 points in 26 games, with a 2-point lead against &lt;a href=\"Juventud%20de%20Bernal\"&gt;Juventud de Bernal&lt;/a&gt;, in a tournament that also featured &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almirante%20Brown\"&gt;Almirante Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Mor%C3%B3n\"&gt;Deportivo Mor\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. Deportivo Riestra stayed in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; for the next two decades, but without any successful seasons the club was not close to promotion positions. An 18th place in 1963 would have meant relegation for them, but the annulment of relegations that year allowed the team to stay. Riestra won the Reclasificaci\u00f3n tournament in 1969, a playoff involving many teams trying to avoid relegation, which would be the only achievement for them in this spell in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;. In 1971 the club had its current name after merging with 'Asociaci\u00f3n de Fomento Barrio Col\u00f3n', an organization established in 1929 by businessmen and professionals that performed social activities and lobbied for improvements in the neighbourhood.\nRiestra's performance changed in 1977, when the \"Blanquinegro\" achieved third place in the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; tournament that, even when distance to champions &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Sarmiento\"&gt;Sarmiento&lt;/a&gt; was 10 points, indicated a better shape in play. However, the next seasons showed the team back in the last positions. Finally, Riestra finished last in the 1981 tournament and was relegated for the first time, in the same year that the &lt;a href=\"National%20Reorganization%20Process\"&gt;military dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; took its stadium to build a highway.\nInstability and revival.\nThe return to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't have Riestra in the top positions, but more frequently in the middle of the table. In 1986, after a restructuring of &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments, a six-month season was played with promotion for the top six teams. Riestra qualified to the Final Round of the tournament after finishing third in its pool with 13 points, only one ahead of rivals &lt;a href=\"Sacachispas%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Club\"&gt;Sacachispas&lt;/a&gt;. The Blanquinegro then won 4 out of 5 games in the Final Round, winning the tournament and promoting back to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following years were unstable for them, who were not able to keep their spot in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; after relegation in its first season back. Three seasons later, Riestra suffered its first (and so far only) disaffiliation after being last in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; averages. The season out of competition meant a revival for Riestra, that achieved success in the following season, qualifying for the playoff tournaments three years in a row. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Blanquinegro squad achieved to be runners-up of both &lt;a href=\"Apertura%20and%20Clausura\"&gt;Apertura and Clausura&lt;/a&gt; tournaments, and won the playoff championship after defeating &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20General%20Lamadrid\"&gt;Lamadrid&lt;/a&gt; 7\u20130 on aggregate and &lt;a href=\"Ca%C3%B1uelas%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Club\"&gt;Ca\u00f1uelas&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 in the finals. They achieved promotion to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; again with a campaign that starred Francisco Bersc\u00e9 as goalkeeper and Julio S\u00e1nchez as top scorer, with 19 goals.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;, Riestra was again close to relegation, which was avoided after winning a playoff match 2\u20131 against &lt;a href=\"Club%20Comunicaciones\"&gt;Comunicaciones&lt;/a&gt;. The following seasons were successful, with two qualifications to playoff for promotion. However, Riestra was not able to keep the good performance, and was relegated back to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; in the 2001\u201302 season. The Blanquinegro squad did not improve in the following years, and by 2005\u201306 was the second last average of the league, avoiding a new disaffiliation by just one point. Riestra qualified again for playoffs in 2007\u201308 after 11 seasons, ending the championship in the ninth position. The Malevos achieved a good performance again in the 2008\u201309 season, when they were runners-up just three points behind champions &lt;a href=\"Club%20Ferrocarril%20Midland\"&gt;Midland&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later Riestra won the playoff tournament after defeating &lt;a href=\"Argentino%20de%20Quilmes\"&gt;Argentino de Quilmes&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the finals, qualifying for the Promotion playoff against &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Defensores%20Unidos\"&gt;Defensores Unidos&lt;/a&gt;. After winning the first leg 3\u20132 at home, Riestra lost 1\u20130 away and was not promoted on rules advantage for the highest tier team.\nHistoric campaigns and double promotion.\nDuring the following seasons Riestra achieved several good results, qualifying many times to the playoffs, though without getting promotion back to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, Riestra became the first Primera D squad to qualify to &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Argentina\"&gt;Copa Argentina&lt;/a&gt;'s Round of 32. The Blanquinegro side had a remarkable performance in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Copa%20Argentina\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt; tournament, in which defeated &lt;a href=\"Club%20Social%20y%20Deportivo%20Mu%C3%B1iz\"&gt;Mu\u00f1iz&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the First Round, and managed to drive &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Los%20Andes\"&gt;Los Andes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Acassuso\"&gt;Acassuso&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; teams to goalless draws, qualifying on &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kicks&lt;/a&gt;. In a historical draw, Riestra met &lt;a href=\"Quilmes%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Club\"&gt;Quilmes&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt; team, in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fernando%20del%20Valle%20de%20Catamarca\"&gt;San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca&lt;/a&gt;, achieving a 0\u20130 tie and being eliminated only in the &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kicks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the 2012\u201313 season a sponsor brought to the club an integral project for the development of football, building a semi-professional structure assisted by the counselling of &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;, which generated an unprecedented publicity of the club in worldwide media. The campaign in that season was again successful for the Blanquinegro, that became again runners-up of the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt;, after champions &lt;a href=\"Argentino%20de%20Quilmes\"&gt;Argentino de Quilmes&lt;/a&gt;. Riestra was not able to promote after losing playoff finals to &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Ituzaing%C3%B3\"&gt;Ituzaing\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; on penalty kicks after a 2\u20132 aggregate score.\nA year later, the Blanquinegro squad achieved their second &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; championship. They won 75 points, remaining unbeaten throughout the second round of the tournament, and with just 3 losses in the entire season. &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carlos%20Herrera\"&gt;Jonathan Herrera&lt;/a&gt;, with 26 goals, became top scorer of the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; championship and of all &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments combined. The team also featured &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Goya\"&gt;Jonathan Goya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Maffoni\"&gt;Bruno Maffoni&lt;/a&gt; as midfielders, with 31 games, and &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Gustavo%20Ben%C3%ADtez\"&gt;Jorge Ben\u00edtez&lt;/a&gt; in defence, in 30 games. This promotion meant for Riestra their debut in professional football for the following season.\nThe return to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt; would be successful for the Blanquinegro side, with very quick success. The 2014 season was played in a six-month spell with three promotions due to a new arrangement of &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments. Surprisingly, Riestra achieved the second position in their pool, 3 points behind winners &lt;a href=\"Defensores%20de%20Belgrano\"&gt;Defensores de Belgrano&lt;/a&gt;, and ahead &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Sud\"&gt;Dock Sud&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt; side qualified to the playoffs, where they first met &lt;a href=\"CA%20Excursionistas\"&gt;Excursionistas&lt;/a&gt;, drawing 2\u20132 on aggregate and qualifying to the finals on &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kicks&lt;/a&gt;. Riestra met &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Sud\"&gt;Dock Sud&lt;/a&gt; in the finals and defeated them 4\u20131 on aggregate to promote to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in history. Riestra featured &lt;a href=\"Gustavo%20Ruhl\"&gt;Gustavo Ruhl&lt;/a&gt; as goalkeeper in every match of the tournament, and &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Peralta\"&gt;Gonzalo Peralta&lt;/a&gt; as defender in all but one games. &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carlos%20Herrera\"&gt;Jonathan Herrera&lt;/a&gt; scored 19 goals and became top scorer of all tournaments combined for the second season in a row. The Blanquinegro squad thus achieved two promotions within one year, an accomplishment a few times seen in Argentine football.\nCurrent events.\nRiestra's debut in Primera B came with success. They achieved to defeat more experienced sides as &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Platense\"&gt;Platense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almirante%20Brown\"&gt;Almirante Brown&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Brown\"&gt;Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almagro\"&gt;Almagro&lt;/a&gt;, the sides that would be promoted that season. These results drove the Blanquinegro side to the top positions of the tournament at the beginning, reaching third by the end of the first round. However, Riestra showed a poor performance in the second round that left them in the 14th position by the end of the season, thus missing playoffs but managing to stay in the division as their initial goal was. As a distinctive achievement &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carlos%20Herrera\"&gt;Jonathan Herrera&lt;/a&gt; became top scorer of all &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments for the third time in a row, an unparalleled feat in modern Argentine football.\nRegarding the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Copa%20Argentina\"&gt;cup competition&lt;/a&gt; the Blanquinegro side reached Round of 32 for the second time, in which they first met a &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; side, losing 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Central\"&gt;Rosario Central&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Malevos signed many new players for the six-month &lt;a href=\"2016%20Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;2016 season&lt;/a&gt;, especially defenders, with the objective of avoiding relegation once again. The results were not good at the beginning, with a 7 matches winless streak. After a coach change results improved and Riestra managed to win five games and stay in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; for another season.\nThe team accomplished their best historical performance in the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;2016\u201317 league season&lt;/a&gt;, becoming runners-up of the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; in their third season in the division. Riestra placed in the top positions since the beginning and was the top scorer team in the season, with 53 goals in 36 games, scoring more than three at home against &lt;a href=\"Defensores%20de%20Belgrano\"&gt;Defensores de Belgrano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Platense\"&gt;Platense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talleres%20de%20Remedios%20de%20Escalada\"&gt;Talleres&lt;/a&gt;, and also away at &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almirante%20Brown\"&gt;Almirante Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Colegiales\"&gt;Colegiales&lt;/a&gt;. In the playoffs, Riestra reached the finals after a home draw against &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Platense\"&gt;Platense&lt;/a&gt; and an aggregate 2\u20131 win against &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol&lt;/a&gt;. The finals featured 4th placed team &lt;a href=\"Club%20Comunicaciones\"&gt;Comunicaciones&lt;/a&gt; amidst some controversy due to a field invasion with five minutes to go, allegedly by a Riestra player, and also other regulation breaches reported by rivals and the press. &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; upheld some of the accusations while dismissed others, and decided continuation of the match in a neutral field, and several penalties for Deportivo Riestra, including a 20-point deduction the following season, later reduced to 10 points on an appeal. The match went on a few days later with a Blanquinegro victory 2\u20131, which were promoted to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in their history.\nThe Blanquinegro squad also achieved their best in the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Copa%20Argentina\"&gt;cup competition&lt;/a&gt; of the season, reaching the Round of 16 for the first time after defeating &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Tigre\"&gt;Tigre&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kicks&lt;/a&gt;, before being eliminated once again by &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Central\"&gt;Rosario Central&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team had some remarkable matches in their &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional debut&lt;/a&gt;, including victories against the top three teams in the competition: &lt;a href=\"Aldosivi\"&gt;Aldosivi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almagro\"&gt;Almagro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Mart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their campaign, that would have had the team qualified to the Reducido, Riestra ended the season in the relegation zone due to the 10-point deduction related to previous season incidents. The club made an appeal at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sports\"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which agreed to take the case, an unprecedented event in Argentine football. After a negative decision from the Court, Riestra was relegated back to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; for the next season.\nRiestra kept the roster mostly unchanged back in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt;, completing a 17-match undefeated strike that made them lead the tournament. However, 4 defeats in a row took them down to the sixth position. After a change in management and the return of &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carlos%20Herrera\"&gt;Jonathan Herrera&lt;/a&gt; back from loan, the &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt; squad would complete another set of 11 matches without losses, including two victories against derby rivals &lt;a href=\"Sacachispas%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Club\"&gt;Sacachispas&lt;/a&gt;. The Blanquinegros clinched a spot in the next &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt; season after finishing fourth in the league. Riestra's &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Bravo\"&gt;Gonzalo Bravo&lt;/a&gt; was the top goalscorer of the tournament, with 20 goals in the season.\nPlaying kit.\nDeportivo Riestra's kit has traditionally been black and white vertical stripes, aligned with the club's colours, which were taken from the ancient El Trueno (Spanish for \"The Thunder\") team, who lent old kits to Riestra in their beginnings. Starting in 2012, with the arrival of a new sponsor, Riestra wears black shirts with white details.\nStadium.\nDeportivo Riestra own the Guillermo Laza stadium, where they send their home matches. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Soldati\"&gt;Villa Soldati&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, it has a capacity is 3,000 in its three stands, one of which is for seating. Its facilities include press cabins, training field and indoor stadium.\nRiestra first used a field in the &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Pompeya\"&gt;Nueva Pompeya&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood, until they built their first stadium in Lacarra Avenue of &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Soldati\"&gt;Villa Soldati&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. The Blanquinegro squad owned this field until 1981, when Riestra suffered its &lt;a href=\"expropriation\"&gt;expropriation&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Reorganization%20Process\"&gt;Argentine military dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; to build a highway. Afterwards, Riestra remained without a home field for more than 12 years, sending home matches to nearby stadiums such as &lt;a href=\"Barracas%20Central\"&gt;Barracas Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacachispas%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Club\"&gt;Sacachispas&lt;/a&gt; fields.\nThe Blanquinegro club acquired a 2.5 hectares field to build a sports complex in 1979. After losing their stadium, plans were changed to build a new stadium in the place. On 20 February 1993 the Guillermo Laza stadium was opened, named to honour a former vice-president of the club. Riestra defeated &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Atlas\"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 that day, their first match in the new stadium.\nIn 2009 Riestra made the last payment of their mortgage, an important upside for the club's financial position. Between 2012 and 2013 the club made several improvements to their property, including training facilities to host youth teams fixtures, as well as a new full-seater stand with a capacity of 500. In 2015 the H\u00e9ctor Salorio indoor stadium was inaugurated, used by the &lt;a href=\"futsal\"&gt;futsal&lt;/a&gt; teams with a capacity of 200.\nOther sports and social activities.\nYouth football.\nBesides professional football, Deportivo Riestra is home to a Reserves team and amateur youth teams, both within &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; and local tournaments. Riestra also fields a team in the official Senior Tournament.\nFutsal.\nRiestra started practising &lt;a href=\"futsal\"&gt;futsal&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 in &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;AFA&lt;/a&gt; second division. After a spell in their participation, the club resumed the team in 2017 at Primera D, fourth division in the futsal league system. Riestra's futsal section also has Reserves and youth teams.\nOther.\nDeportivo Riestra has traditionally had a &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; section, affiliated to the Metropolitan Chess Federation, and more recently the Copa Cultura AFA, which they won in 2017. The club's headquarters also host recreational sports and activities such as &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"roller%20skating\"&gt;roller skating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tango\"&gt;tango&lt;/a&gt;, and a retirees club."
