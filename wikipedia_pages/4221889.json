    "text": "Joachim Albrecht Leo Eggeling (30 November 1884 \u2013 15 April 1945) was the German &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Gauleiter\"&gt;Gauleiter&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Gau%20Halle-Merseburg\"&gt;Halle-Merseburg&lt;/a&gt; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Oberpr%C3%A4sident\"&gt;Oberpr\u00e4sident&lt;/a&gt;\" (High President) of the Province of &lt;a href=\"Halle-Merseburg\"&gt;Halle-Merseburg&lt;/a&gt;. He was also an SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Obergruppenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEarly years.\nEggeling was born in &lt;a href=\"Blankenburg%20am%20Harz\"&gt;Blankenburg am Harz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brunswick\"&gt;Duchy of Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. A farmer's son, Eggeling went to the \"B\u00fcrgerschule\" (a type of vocational school once found in some parts of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; in Blankenburg. Between 1898 and 1904 he completed officer training at the cadet schools at &lt;a href=\"Schloss%20Oranienstein\"&gt;Oranienstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gro%C3%9F-Lichterfelde\"&gt;Gro\u00df-Lichterfelde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 1904, Eggeling joined the army as an &lt;a href=\"Leutnant\"&gt;Leutnant&lt;/a&gt; in the 10th Hanoverian &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20%28infantry%29\"&gt;J\u00e4ger&lt;/a&gt; Battalion and, after August 1914, served in combat units during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; on both the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; fronts. In January 1915 he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Hauptmann\"&gt;Hauptmann&lt;/a&gt; and led a machine-gun unit. He was wounded three times and awarded the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Cross\"&gt;Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;, first and second class.\nAfter November 1918, he fought as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Goslar%20%28district%29\"&gt;Goslar&lt;/a&gt; riflemen against the left-wing &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spartacus%20League\"&gt;Spartacus League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1919 Eggeling retired from the army and attended the Agricultural College at Halle until 1922. He completed his studies at the age of 35 and began work as an &lt;a href=\"agriculturist\"&gt;agriculturist&lt;/a&gt;. In November 1922 he was administering the state agricultural farm at &lt;a href=\"Frose\"&gt;Frose&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20of%20Anhalt\"&gt;Anhalt&lt;/a&gt;. \nNazi Party career.\nEggeling first joined the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; in September 1923 shortly before it was banned in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Hall%20Putsch\"&gt;Beer Hall Putsch&lt;/a&gt;. He rejoined on 28 July 1925 (member number: 11,579) after the ban on the Party was lifted. He founded several ortsgruppen (local groups) in Anhalt in 1926, and from 1926 to 1930 was the agricultural policy advisor to the \"Gauleiter\" of Anhalt-Sachsen-Nord. In 1930, Eggeling organized the agrarian policy apparatus in &lt;a href=\"Gau%20Magdeburg-Anhalt\"&gt;Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt&lt;/a&gt;. In 1933 he was named Deputy \"Gauleiter\" for Gau Magdeburg-Anhalt. In May 1933, he became a member of the Anhalt State Council (\"Staatsrat\"). In June 1933 he was appointed provincial agricultural leader (\"Landesbauernf\u00fchrer\") of both Anhalt and the Prussian &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Province of Saxony&lt;/a&gt;. Eggeling's skills so impressed his superiors that he was elected to the \"&lt;a href=\"Reichstag%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29\"&gt;Reichstag&lt;/a&gt;\" from electoral constituency 10 (Magdeburg) in November, 1933. In 1934 he was appointed to the Prussian Provincial Council for the Province of Saxony.\nAfter \"Gauleiter\" &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Loeper\"&gt;Wilhelm Friedrich Loeper&lt;/a&gt;'s death on 23 October 1935, Eggeling, as Deputy \"Gauleiter\", was charged with the leadership of the Gau's business, and was formally named Acting \"Gauleiter\" on 10 February 1936. Owing to this, he was granted leave from his job as a provincial agricultural leader at that time. In June of the same year, Eggeling joined the &lt;a href=\"Schutzstaffel\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; (membership number: 186,515). He was given the honorary rank of SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Brigadef%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Brigadef\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\" and attached to the staff of the \"&lt;a href=\"Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS\"&gt;Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 20 April 1937 Eggeling was appointed \"Gauleiter\" of &lt;a href=\"Gau%20Halle-Merseburg\"&gt;Gau Halle-Merseburg&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Jordan%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Rudolf Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20State%20Council\"&gt;Prussian State Council&lt;/a&gt; and promoted to SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Gruppenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Gruppenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\". On 10 April 1938, he was elected to the \"Reichstag\" for constituency 11 (Merseburg). In April 1941, he became a member of the Reich Advisory Council for Food and Agriculture. On 16 November 1942, he was named &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Defense%20Commissioner\"&gt;Reich Defense Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; for his Gau.\nOn 21 June 1943, Eggeling was promoted to SS-\"&lt;a href=\"Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer\"&gt;Obergruppenf\u00fchrer&lt;/a&gt;\". On 18 August 1944 he was appointed \"&lt;a href=\"Oberpr%C3%A4sident\"&gt;Oberpr\u00e4sident&lt;/a&gt;\" of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Halle-Merseburg\"&gt;Province of Halle-Merseburg&lt;/a&gt;. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. In September 1944, he assumed command of the recently established \"&lt;a href=\"Volkssturm\"&gt;Volkssturm&lt;/a&gt;\" units in his Gau. On 13 April, 1945, convinced of the futility of defending the town of Halle, overcrowded with thousands of refugees, from the advancing &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; troops, Eggeling traveled to the \"&lt;a href=\"F%C3%BChrerbunker\"&gt;F\u00fchrerbunker&lt;/a&gt;\" to try and get &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; to rescind his unconditional order to defend to the death. He first raised the issue of a peaceful handover of the city with &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Bormann\"&gt;Martin Bormann&lt;/a&gt;, Personal Secretary to the F\u00fchrer, who warned Eggeling that this would result in his execution and the extermination of his family. At their meeting, Hitler ordered Eggeling to continue to defend the city to the last man. Having failed in his mission, Eggeling returned to Halle and committed &lt;a href=\"suicide\"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; by poison at &lt;a href=\"Moritzburg%20%28Halle%29\"&gt;Moritzburg Castle&lt;/a&gt; on 15 April."
