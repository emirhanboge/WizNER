    "text": "The Greater Region (, , ), is a geopolitical region within Europe, created to promote economic, cultural, touristic and social development and cooperation. It occupies an area of with &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; at its center and including adjacent regions of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. It covers the area of &lt;a href=\"Saarland\"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorraine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Lorraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;. It is \"not\" identical with the &lt;a href=\"SaarLorLux\"&gt;SaarLorLux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Euroregion\"&gt;Euroregion&lt;/a&gt;, despite being in the same territory.\nIt is situated between the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moselle\"&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saar%20%28river%29\"&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meuse\"&gt;Meuse&lt;/a&gt; rivers, has an overall area of 65,401 km\u00b2. Its population counts 11.2 million inhabitants, representing 2.5% of the total population of the 27-state &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, and accounting for the same proportion of the EU &lt;a href=\"GDP\"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greater Region is divided between &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; languages and also forms the &lt;a href=\"Transportation%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"transport%20in%20Europe\"&gt;transport in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It has an urban, rural (&lt;a href=\"Ardennes\"&gt;Ardennes&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Eifel\"&gt;Eifel&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Rheinhessen\"&gt;Rheinhessen&lt;/a&gt;) and industrial fabric which is the source of rich and ongoing economic and cultural relations.\nGeography.\nThe Greater Region of Luxembourg is composed of the Grand Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saarland\"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorraine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Lorraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; and the German-speaking community of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, covering a total area of and spreading more than from east to west and more than from north to south. Northern Wallonia and the &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20valley\"&gt;Rhine valley&lt;/a&gt; are parts of a single mountain ridge, which forms a natural border in the north and northeast of the Greater Region. Numerous large cities and a high density of population and transport networks significantly influence the layout of this northern part. In the south, on the other hand, the Greater Region is connected to a diagonal of small population density and low economic dynamism proceeding from the center of Spain to the eastern plains of the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Basin\"&gt;Paris Basin&lt;/a&gt;. In between these two regions, the &lt;a href=\"Euroregion\"&gt;Euroregion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"SaarLorLux\"&gt;SaarLorLux&lt;/a&gt; constitutes an industrial core area with many &lt;a href=\"urban%20agglomeration\"&gt;urban agglomeration&lt;/a&gt;s in the geometric center of the Greater Region. Within this area, the densely populated axes of the &lt;a href=\"Moselle%20valley\"&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saar%20%28river%29\"&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt; valleys, and the extensive transport network that connects this central region with the outlying regions of the Rhine, provide internal continuity and essential access to the neighboring regions.\nThe size of the Greater Region is more than 400 km from East to West and more than 350 km from North to South.\n\"11.2 Millions of people live in the Greater Region; this is corresponding to 3% of the total population of the 15 European Union member states. In the same dimension the Greater Region contributes to the &lt;a href=\"gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; of the community. (...) All four member states are faced with economic challenges, being subject to changes in their industrial and mining industries. So they create a certain syndicate to cope with these problems, like the \"European Development Pool of the sectors &lt;a href=\"Longwy\"&gt;Longwy&lt;/a&gt; (France), &lt;a href=\"Rodange\"&gt;Rodange&lt;/a&gt; (Luxembourg), &lt;a href=\"Athus\"&gt;Athus&lt;/a&gt; (Belgium)\".\nDemography.\nOn 1 January 2008, the Greater Region of Luxembourg had 11,359,815 inhabitants distributed very unevenly among its five subregions. More than half of the population lived in Rhineland-Palatinate and Wallonia. Only 4.26% of the total population lived in Luxembourg, the smallest subregion.\nA very slight decrease of the total population of the Greater Region is forecast for 2030. However, there are important differences in the projected evolution of the populations of the various subregions. For example, Luxembourg will experience an increase of 0.25%, while a decrease of 0.11% is predicted for the German state of &lt;a href=\"Saarland\"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nThe Greater Region of Luxembourg is characterized by a very high number of daily commuters: in 2007\u201308 there were 164,000 altogether, of whom 132,000 worked in Luxembourg. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the &lt;a href=\"European%20Development%20Pole\"&gt;European Development Pole&lt;/a&gt; in the cross-border area of &lt;a href=\"Longwy\"&gt;Longwy&lt;/a&gt; in France, &lt;a href=\"Rodange\"&gt;Rodange&lt;/a&gt; in Luxembourg and &lt;a href=\"Athus\"&gt;Athus&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium.\nThe European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and &lt;a href=\"Meuse%20%28river%29\"&gt;Meuse&lt;/a&gt; presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. More than half of them come from &lt;a href=\"Lorraine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Lorraine&lt;/a&gt; and almost three-quarters (73.4%) work in Luxembourg. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing. The other subregions have more out-commuters than in-commuters. Lorraine provides the highest number of workers for the neighbouring regions (89,478 as of 2009).\nCulture.\nIn 2007 Luxembourg and the Greater Region, together with city of &lt;a href=\"Sibiu\"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;, Romania, were designated by the European Union for a period of one year to be the &lt;a href=\"European%20Capital%20of%20Culture\"&gt;European Capital of Culture&lt;/a&gt;, during which they were given a chance to showcase their &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; life and cultural development.\nFor their focal themes, the subregions selected:\nThe \"Espace culturel Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Cultural Space Greater Region) association was created in 2007 while the Greater Region was a European Capital of Culture. This association is a project cofinanced by the European Regional Development Funds, within the framework of the \"INTERREG IV A program Grande R\u00e9gion\". Its goals are the pursuit and conservation of cross-border cultural cooperation. The main activities of the association are to bring cultural authorities of the Greater Region together and to define a common work program. This work program of the \"Espace culturel Grande R\u00e9gion\" has the following key themes:\nThe partners of the \"Espace culturel Grande R\u00e9gion\" are:\nMuseums and temporary exhibitions.\nIn the Greater Region more than 1,200 museums and other institutions present and conserve the heritage of this core European region. \nHistory.\nThe history of the Greater Region and its subdivisions is a mirror of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Europe\"&gt;History of Europe&lt;/a&gt; starting from the prehistory up to the current European history. Outstanding testimonials of all European eras can be retrieved in the area of the Greater Region. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Romanization\"&gt;Romanization&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Roman&lt;/a&gt; times and the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic people&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Antiquity\"&gt;Late Antiquity&lt;/a&gt;, the Greater Region became a threshold region up today. Hence the cultural, historical, political, economical and social inhomogeneities shape the region and its inhabitants until today. Several wars, like the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Lords%27%20War\"&gt;Four Lords' War&lt;/a&gt;, and foremost &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Verdun\"&gt;Battle of Verdun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge\"&gt;Battle of the Bulge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maginot%20Line\"&gt;Maginot Line&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Siegfried%20Line\"&gt;Siegfried Line&lt;/a&gt; devastated the region. Today, peaceful forms of coexistence, like the numerous cross-border commuters, may be seen. \nTourism.\nThe Greater Region contains many interesting tourist destinations. In general, they can be reached in day trips from any starting point within the Greater Region. The following are the major tourist destinations in the area:\nInterreg program.\nThe Greater Region is supported by &lt;a href=\"Interreg%20III\"&gt;Interreg III&lt;/a&gt;, a Community initiative which aims to stimulate interregional cooperation in the EU between 2000-06. It is financed under the &lt;a href=\"European%20Regional%20Development%20Fund\"&gt;European Regional Development Fund&lt;/a&gt; (ERDF).\nThis phase of the Interreg initiative is designed to strengthen economic and social cohesion throughout the EU, by fostering the balanced development of the continent through cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.\nThe current &lt;a href=\"INTERREG%20IV%20A%20Greater%20Region\"&gt;INTERREG IV A Greater Region&lt;/a&gt; (Grande R\u00e9gion) programme (period 2007 - 2013) has been elaborated to enforce the cooperation between the project partners from the different parts of the Greater Region."
