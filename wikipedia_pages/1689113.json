    "title": "October 1978 papal conclave",
    "text": "The October 1978 papal conclave was triggered by the death of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20I\"&gt;Pope John Paul I&lt;/a&gt; on 28 September 1978, just 33 days after his election on 26 August. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October and ended two days later on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinal electors selected Cardinal Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent &lt;a href=\"Year%20of%20Three%20Popes\"&gt;Year of Three Popes&lt;/a&gt;, he accepted his election and took the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20name\"&gt;pontifical name&lt;/a&gt; of \"John Paul II\".\n\"Papabili\" and proceedings.\nTen days after the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20I\"&gt;Pope John Paul I&lt;/a&gt;, on 14 October, the doors of the &lt;a href=\"Sistine%20Chapel\"&gt;Sistine Chapel&lt;/a&gt; were sealed and the conclave commenced. It was divided between two particularly strong &lt;a href=\"Papabile\"&gt;candidates for the papacy&lt;/a&gt;: Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Siri\"&gt;Giuseppe Siri&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archbishop%20of%20Genoa\"&gt;archbishop of Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, and Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Benelli\"&gt;Giovanni Benelli&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archbishop%20of%20Florence\"&gt;archbishop of Florence&lt;/a&gt; and a close associate of John Paul I.\nInside the conclave were three non-cardinals. One was &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Wuerl\"&gt;Donald Wuerl&lt;/a&gt; who, as secretary to the frail Cardinal &lt;a href=\"John%20Wright%20%28cardinal%29\"&gt;John Wright&lt;/a&gt;, was allowed inside the Sistine Chapel to assist him.\nThis conclave had the same number of cardinals as the first conclave of 1978. Only Albino Luciani himself (who became Pope John Paul I) was absent from this conclave after having attended the first conclave of 1978, and numerically this was offset by the presence of Cardinal Wright at this conclave.\nSupporters of Benelli were confident that he would be elected. In early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes. But the scale of opposition to both \"papabili\" meant that neither was likely to receive the two-thirds majority for election. Among the Italian contingent, Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Colombo\"&gt;Giovanni Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milan\"&gt;Archbishop of Milan&lt;/a&gt;, was the only viable compromise candidate, but when he started to receive votes, he announced that if elected he would decline the papacy. Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Franz%20K%C3%B6nig\"&gt;Franz K\u00f6nig&lt;/a&gt;, the influential and widely respected &lt;a href=\"archbishop%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;archbishop of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, individually suggested to his fellow electors a compromise candidate: the &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Karol%20J%C3%B3zef%20Wojty%C5%82a\"&gt;Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;, whom K\u00f6nig knew and by whom he was highly impressed.\nAlso among those cardinals who rallied behind Wojty\u0142a were supporters of Siri, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; cardinals (led by &lt;a href=\"John%20Krol\"&gt;John Krol&lt;/a&gt;), and other &lt;a href=\"moderate\"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; cardinals. Wojty\u0142a ultimately defeated Benelli (who was supposedly the candidate Wojty\u0142a himself had voted for) on the eighth ballot on the third day with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors. He accepted his election with these words: \"With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, I accept.\" The pope, in tribute to his immediate predecessor, then took the name of John Paul II. He became the first non-&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pope\"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20VI\"&gt;Adrian VI&lt;/a&gt;, who reigned from 1522 to 1523.\nAt 6:18\u00a0p.m. &lt;a href=\"Central%20European%20Time\"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (17:18 &lt;a href=\"Coordinated%20Universal%20Time\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), the white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, announcing to the public that a new pope had been elected. The &lt;a href=\"Protodeacon\"&gt;senior cardinal deacon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pericle%20Felici\"&gt;Pericle Felici&lt;/a&gt;, after quickly checking the correct pronunciation of the new pope's &lt;a href=\"Polish%20name\"&gt;Polish name&lt;/a&gt; with Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, gave the traditional &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Habemus%20Papam\"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Wojty\u0142a's election from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.\nJohn Paul II appeared on the balcony at 7:15, and while gripping the &lt;a href=\"Baluster\"&gt;balustrade&lt;/a&gt;, delivered a brief speech before his first \"&lt;a href=\"Urbi%20et%20Orbi\"&gt;Urbi et Orbi&lt;/a&gt;\" blessing in Italian:\nCardinals ineligible to participate.\nThe rule Paul VI established in \"&lt;a href=\"Ingravescentem%20aetatem\"&gt;Ingravescentem aetatem&lt;/a&gt;\" (1970) and reiterated in \"&lt;a href=\"Romano%20Pontifici%20Eligendo\"&gt;Romano Pontifici Eligendo&lt;/a&gt;\" (1975) limited participation in the conclave to cardinals who had yet to reach the age of 80 on the first day of the conclave. The August 1978 conclave was the first in which this rule applied and that of October 1978 the second. No cardinals reached 80 between the two conclaves of 1978. The 15 cardinals ineligible to participate in both 1978 conclaves were:"
