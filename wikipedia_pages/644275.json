    "text": "Robert Heron (6 November 1764 \u2013 13 April 1807) was a Scottish writer.\nLife.\nRobert Heron was son of John Heron, a &lt;a href=\"Weaver%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;weaver&lt;/a&gt;, and was born in &lt;a href=\"New%20Galloway\"&gt;New Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirkcudbrightshire\"&gt;Kirkcudbrightshire&lt;/a&gt;, on 6 November 1764. He was taught privately by his mother until his ninth year, when he was sent to the parish school, where he displayed such precocity that at the age of eleven he was employed to teach some of the local farmers' children and at fourteen was appointed master of the parochial school of Kelton. \nBy the end of 1780, he had saved sufficient money to enable him, with the help of his parents, to enter the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; with the view of studying for the church. He supported his studies partly by teaching but chiefly by miscellaneous work for booksellers. In autumn 1789, while a divinity student, he visited &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Burns\"&gt;Robert Burns&lt;/a&gt;, who entrusted him with a letter to a Dr. Blacklock, which he failed to deliver. In a rhyming epistle to Blacklock, Burns attributes Heron's faithlessness either to preoccupation with 'some dainty fair one,\u2019 or to partiality for liquor.\nHeron was for some time assistant to a Dr. Blair, but, according to his own statement, all his 'ideas, as well of exertion as of enjoyment, soon became literary.' His first independent literary venture was a small edition in 1789 of Thomson's \"Seasons\", with a criticism on his poetry; a larger edition appeared in 1793. In 1790\u20131, he announced a course of lectures on the \"Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, the Jewish, the Grecian, the Roman and the Canon Law, and then on the Feudal Law,\" intended as an introduction to the study of law, but the scheme was unsuccessful. \nHis imprudent habits overwhelmed him with debt, and he was thrown into prison by his creditors. On their suggestion, he undertook a \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Scotland%20%28book%29\"&gt;History of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;\" for Messrs. Morrison of Perth, who engaged to pay him three guineas per sheet. After making some progress he was liberated from prison on condition of devoting two-thirds of his remuneration to paying 15\"s\". in the pound. The first volume (1794), was nearly all written in gaol. In his preface, he expressed a hope that this would be regarded as some excuse for 'considerable imperfections.' The excuse is naive but all Heron's works bear evident marks of superficial knowledge and hurried composition. The \"History\" was completed in six volumes, 1794\u20139. \nIn 1798, at the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Theatre Royal, Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Heron produced a comedy which was condemned before the second act. Attributing its failure to a conspiracy against him, he published it under the title \"St. Kilda in Edinburgh, or News from Camperdown, a Comic Drama in Two Acts, with a Critical Preface, to which is added an Account of a famous Ass Race\" (1798); the publication attracted no attention. Returning to &lt;a href=\"New%20Galloway%20%28Parliament%20of%20Scotland%20constituency%29\"&gt;New Galloway&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"ruling%20elder\"&gt;ruling elder&lt;/a&gt;, Heron served several years in the &lt;a href=\"General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;General Assembly of the Church of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and frequently spoke with fluency and ability. \nIn order to obtain more constant literary occupation, he removed in 1799 to London, where he contributed largely to the periodicals, editing the \"Globe,\" the \"British Press,\" and other newspapers, and acting as a parliamentary reporter. In 1806 he commenced a newspaper entitled \"The Fame,\" which proved unsuccessful. Its failure and Heron's improvident habits led to his confinement by his creditors in &lt;a href=\"Newgate%20prison\"&gt;Newgate prison&lt;/a&gt;, where, according to his own statement, he was reduced 'to the very extremity of bodily and pecuniary distress.' On 2 February 1807, from Newgate, he wrote a letter to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Literary%20Fund\"&gt;Royal Literary Fund&lt;/a&gt;, recounting his services to literature, and appealing for aid, but the appeal met with no response. Being attacked by fever, Heron was removed to &lt;a href=\"St%20Pancras%20Hospital\"&gt;St Pancras Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where he died 13 April 1807. \nWorks.\nBesides the works above mentioned, Heron also published: \nA manuscript \"Journal of My Conduct\", by Heron, is in the library of the University of Edinburgh (Laing collection). Heron also contributed to the \"&lt;a href=\"Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica\"&gt;Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;,\" the \"&lt;a href=\"London%20and%20Edinburgh%20Philosophical%20Magazine\"&gt;Edinburgh Magazine&lt;/a&gt;,\" and other periodicals; and was employed by Sir &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Sinclair%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;John Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; in the preparation of the \"Statistical Account of Scotland.\""
