    "text": "Mavrud (, from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, \u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc \"(mavr\u00f3)\", \"&lt;a href=\"black\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;\") is a red &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"grape\"&gt;grape&lt;/a&gt; that is used as both a blending grape and for &lt;a href=\"varietal\"&gt;varietal&lt;/a&gt; wines, indigenous to the Balkan region. It's growing in some regions in &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrace\"&gt;Thrace&lt;/a&gt; region in &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, some regions in Greece and in Romania.\nThe grape has been described as a characterful, low-&lt;a href=\"yield%20%28wine%29\"&gt;yielding&lt;/a&gt;, small-berried and late-ripening grape capable of producing &lt;a href=\"tannins%20in%20grape\"&gt;tannic&lt;/a&gt;, spicy wine with a potential for &lt;a href=\"Aging%20of%20wine\"&gt;ageing&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRegarded as one of the most highly esteemed local wines, Mavrud vineyards are mainly found around &lt;a href=\"Asenovgrad\"&gt;Asenovgrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perushtitsa\"&gt;Perushtitsa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as more rarely near &lt;a href=\"Pazardzhik\"&gt;Pazardzhik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stara%20Zagora\"&gt;Stara Zagora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chirpan\"&gt;Chirpan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is speculation amongst grape growers that Mavrud may be an ancient clone of Mourvedre, imported into Bulgaria by the Romans.\nLegend.\nA legend that the &lt;a href=\"oenophiles\"&gt;oenophiles&lt;/a&gt; of the Mavrud wine like to repeat in order to explain the restoration of this locality as wine-growing country was that during the reign of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Bulgarian%20monarchs\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krum%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Krum of Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"vineyard\"&gt;vineyard&lt;/a&gt;s were ordered destroyed. Later, a lion escaped from its cage and terrorized the city. However, a fearless young man named Mavrud (now the name of a wine grape) confronted and slew the lion. The king summoned Mavrud's mother to learn the source of such courage. She said she had secretly saved a vine, made wine, and that this was the source of Mavrud's bravery. Khan Krum ordered the vineyards replanted.\nIn the original Bulgarian version the legend says it was a monster called the \"lamyata\" (\u043b\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430) which was vanquished, according to one book on wine."
