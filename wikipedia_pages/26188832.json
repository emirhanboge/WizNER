    "text": "This list of mountains and hills in Rhineland-Palatinate shows a selection of high and/or well-known &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; (\"in order of height\"). Although there is no universally agreed definition, this list treats a mountain as an elevation of 2000 feet (612 m) or higher.\nHighest points of the Rhineland-Palatinate regions.\nThe following table shows the highest mountains and hills of the Rhineland-Palatinate regions.\nIn the \"Region\" column, extensive or high ranges are shown in bold; whilst landscapes which either have no obvious high point or are lowlands with prominent hills (sometimes island-like) are shown in \"italics\". Clicking on the word \"List\" (in the \"Lists\" column), links to further lists of mountains and hills in the particular region or landscape indicated (sometimes outside Rhineland-Palatinate). \nThe table, which is arranged in order of height, may be sorted by clicking on the symbol at the head of the relevant column."
