Originally anchored by &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Bediones\"&gt;Paolo Bediones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20Cosim\"&gt;Cheryl Cosim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Tulfo\"&gt;Erwin Tulfo&lt;/a&gt; it premiered on April 5, 2010, on the network's evening line up replacing \"\". The show concluded on March 13, 2020. &lt;a href=\"Luchi%20Cruz-Valdes\"&gt;Luchi Cruz-Valdes&lt;/a&gt; and Ed Lingao served as the final anchors. It was replaced by \"&lt;a href=\"Frontline%20Pilipinas\"&gt;Frontline Pilipinas&lt;/a&gt;\" in its timeslot.\nBackground.\nThe newscast is based on News5's slogan \"Higit sa Balita, Aksyon!\", which literally means \"Beyond the news, Action\".\nHistory.\nAs a primetime newscast (2010\u20132014).\nAksyon premiered on April 5, 2010, at 9:00 PM with &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Bediones\"&gt;Paolo Bediones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20Cosim\"&gt;Cheryl Cosim&lt;/a&gt; as its first anchors. The news program used a touch-screen television called \"Aksyon Board\". It is the first local newscast to report via Live-Pack in contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Outside%20broadcasting\"&gt;OB Vans&lt;/a&gt; used by its competitors. There is also a round-up news update called Aksyon Ngayon formerly anchored by Dindo Flora, Cristina Lazo, and former &lt;a href=\"DWRR-FM\"&gt;Tambayan 101.9 (now MOR 101.9)&lt;/a&gt; DJ Reggie Valdez.\nOn October 25, 2010, &lt;a href=\"Erwin%20Tulfo\"&gt;Erwin Tulfo&lt;/a&gt; of the police-report-and-public-service-segment \"Aksyon Metro\" joined the newscast and their time slot was moved to 6:00 PM, then 5:45 PM, and then 5:30 PM serving as a former lead-in to the network's former variety shows \"&lt;a href=\"Wil%20Time%20Bigtime\"&gt;Willing Willie/Wil Time Bigtime&lt;/a&gt;\". On that same day, the newscast also introduced a new &lt;a href=\"augmented%20virtuality\"&gt;augmented virtuality&lt;/a&gt; set and OBB. Since November 8, 2010, the newscast began its simulcast on the then-newly launched &lt;a href=\"DWFM\"&gt;Radyo5 92.3 News FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 17, 2011, &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Bediones\"&gt;Paolo Bediones&lt;/a&gt; left the newscast for \"Aksyon JournalisMO\", leaving Cosim and Tulfo as the main anchors, with Shawn Yao (showbiz and weather) and Makata Tawanan (Makata's Super Bidyo) as segment anchors. The newscast was also given new weekday graphics and new virtual background while starting its simulcast on &lt;a href=\"AksyonTV\"&gt;AksyonTV&lt;/a&gt; on February 21, 2011.\nOn June 6, 2011, the newscast added a news desk while updating their graphics and title card. \"Makata's Super Bidyo,\" a video features segment, was reformatted with its new name \"Makatang Gala\" (The Stray Poet), where Makata Tawanan goes on streets to bring information to its viewers. By July 25, 2011, &lt;a href=\"Lourd%20de%20Veyra\"&gt;Lourd de Veyra&lt;/a&gt; joined the newscast, hosting his weather-and-trivia-segment \"Weather or Not\", which includes relevant and historical bites after de Veyra presents the weather.\nOn February 6, 2012, Aksyon divided into two parts, Metro Aksyon focused on police reports around Metro Manila, and &lt;a href=\"Jun%20Sabayton\"&gt;Jun Sabayton&lt;/a&gt; hosted \"Anong Problema Mo\", while remaining 30 minutes is the national and other news. It then became an emergency protocol when its former lead-in public service program, \"\", of the Tulfo brothers was given a long-term suspension by the &lt;a href=\"Movie%20and%20Television%20Review%20and%20Classification%20Board\"&gt;Movie and Television Review and Classification Board&lt;/a&gt; following numerous controversies that hounded the show. By February 20, 2012, Aksyon modified its newsdesk and updating its graphics and title card.\nOn January 7, 2013, Aksyon reexpand its time to 45 minutes, from 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM. It then launched a new segment entitled \"Happy News\", a segment that focuses on light-hearted topics (e.g., travel, food, festivals, etc.) that reflects the Filipino's happy spirit. It has become the newscast's closing segment since its launch.\nIn June 2013, when &lt;a href=\"One%20Sports\"&gt;Sports5&lt;/a&gt; did not renew a blocktime agreement with &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; to air the &lt;a href=\"AKTV\"&gt;AKTV&lt;/a&gt; sports block due to high blocktime costs and low ratings, the newscast's simulcast on &lt;a href=\"AksyonTV\"&gt;AksyonTV&lt;/a&gt; was limited to give way for the primetime sports programming on AksyonTV.\nOn October 14, 2013, along with the launch of News5's primetime block KBO: Karunungan, Balita, Opinyon, Aksyon updated its newsdesk, graphics and title card. later, Aksyon became a 1-hour newscast from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\nOn December 23, 2013, Aksyon, along with other &lt;a href=\"News5\"&gt;News5&lt;/a&gt; programs, transferred from its former TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to a larger &lt;a href=\"TV5%20Media%20Center\"&gt;TV5 Media Center&lt;/a&gt; in Reliance, &lt;a href=\"Mandaluyong\"&gt;Mandaluyong&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 2014, the newscast has two new segments. Caught in Aksyon focuses on issues \u2013 accidents, violation, and wrongful activities caught on CCTV Cameras. \"Makatarugan Ba?\" is about the issues that one or more individuals has a violations in a law, as explained by Atty. Mel Sta. Maria.\nExpansion (2014\u20132017).\nOn July 21, 2014, \"Aksyon\" expanded its newscast by revamping four separate newscasts: \"Aksyon sa Umaga\" (replacing \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Morning%20Club\"&gt;Good Morning Club&lt;/a&gt;\"), \"Aksyon sa Tanghali\" (replacing \"&lt;a href=\"Balitaang%20Tapat\"&gt;Balitaang Tapat&lt;/a&gt;\") back-to-back with T3 Enforced (after moving to noontime slot), the reformatted flagship \"Aksyon Prime\", and \"Aksyon Tonite\" (replacing &lt;a href=\"Pilipinas%20News\"&gt;Pilipinas News&lt;/a&gt; due to manpolling of its anchors like Cherie Mercado and Jove Francisco).\nOn October 21, 2014, \"Aksyon Prime\" cut its runtime to 45 minutes whenever &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20PBA%20season\"&gt;PBA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PBA%20on%20One%20Sports\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; are at hand on weeknights. \"Reaksyon\" once again had a separate program after \"Aksyon Tonite\".\nOn November 3, 2014, Veteran &lt;a href=\"war%20correspondent\"&gt;war correspondent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Center%20for%20Investigative%20Journalism\"&gt;Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism&lt;/a&gt; multimedia director Ed Lingao joins \"Aksyon Tonite\", replacing &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Bediones\"&gt;Paolo Bediones&lt;/a&gt;, which left the newscast as effect of a video scandal while he was on &lt;a href=\"GMA%20Network\"&gt;GMA Network&lt;/a&gt;. Ed Lingao is previously with ABC/TV5 from 2004 \u2013 2009 as Head of News and as Contributor on Aksyon's predecessor, . Ed Lingao's appearance was on a split screen, with Cheryl Cosim presenting from the studio while he is at the scene of the news on location. Andanar became also a temporary co-anchor with Cosim in \"Aksyon Tonite\". But during the coverage of &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Storm%20Fung-wong%20%282014%29\"&gt;Typhoon Mario (Fung-wong)&lt;/a&gt;, Bediones, while being on a leave of absence, had an appearance on \"Aksyon Tonite\" and other \"Aksyon\" newscasts to give a report for Rescue5.\nPaolo Bediones joined \"Aksyon Sa Umaga\" for a short period of time then later removed. However, the public service reminders from Rescue5 with Paolo Bediones were still being aired until his quiet unknown status with the network.\nIn January 2015, \"Aksyon Sa Umaga\" shortened its airing time until 6:30 AM as the network expands its TV5 Kids block.\nOn April 6, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts including Aksyon News Alerts made history as they shifted to 16:9 high definition production, the first among the top three networks in the country. However, as major networks are initially testing digital terrestrial broadcasts at the time being, these newscasts are aired to viewers in a downgraded 4:3 standard definition letterbox (either on widescreen or CRT TVs).\nIn June 2015, all Aksyon Newscasts updated their graphic packages in full 16:9 presentation, which is currently used by major television networks in the US, Australia, most of Europe and other countries. The studio set was also renovated and expanded to accommodate an LED screen at the back of the studio with a desk for the anchor. This also the first time that \"Aksyon Sa Umaga\" doesn't have a separate studio set.\nOn July 20, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts rescaled their graphics to allow TV5 to fit the newscast to the conventional 4:3 broadcast format. However, the letterboxing output shall remain to be used for some circumstances (such as events like the SONA where the originating source only applies to 16:9 widescreen TVs).\nAfter Shawn Yao's controversy on one of her live reports on TV and before anchoring a program on &lt;a href=\"Bloomberg%20TV%20Philippines\"&gt;Bloomberg TV Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (and later &lt;a href=\"One%20News%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;One News&lt;/a&gt;), she left her segment in Aksyon and replaced permanently by MJ Marfori.\nOn January 18, 2016, Tulfo replaced Lourd de Veyra as one of the anchors/hosts of \"Aksyon sa Umaga.\" Erwin and Martin's tandem in early morning television show made a return after \"Good Morning Sir\"; their radio program \"Punto Asintado\" became a segment again in \"Aksyon Sa Umaga\". Erwin Tulfo is still one of the anchors of \"Aksyon Prime\".\nOn February 15, 2016, \"Aksyon sa Tanghali\" introduced \"Balitaserye,\" a five-minute crime investigation segments, anchored by Gary de Leon.\nOn April 18, 2016, Cheryl Cosim and TV5's resident legal analyst Atty. Mel Sta. Maria replaced Martin Andanar and Erwin Tulfo as anchors/hosts of \"Aksyon sa Umaga.\" This is Cheryl Cosim's return as a morning anchor/host after \"Good Morning Club\", though she still anchored \"Aksyon Tonite\" at that time\".\" This is also Atty. Mel Sta. Maria's first time to become a main anchor of a television newscast. Public service format was added on his arrival. Before this, he already became part of a segment in some newscasts of News5 where he gave similar advice to that which he gave on his radio program \"Relasyon.\"\nIn April 2016, after many years of anchoring various newscasts, this is the first time that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the continuous rerun of \"Crime Klasik\" and as host of \"Punto Asintado\" from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except &lt;a href=\"One%20Sports\"&gt;Sports5&lt;/a&gt; programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But in June 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Communications%20Group%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;PCOO&lt;/a&gt; (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.\nIn May 2016, after the Bilang Pilipino 2016 Election Coverage, all Aksyon newscasts continued to utilize the new studio with a large LED. Unlike ABS-CBN News, BBC News, NBC News and GMA News who came back in their respective newscast studios after the coverage, News5 considered the Election studio as their new studio for all of its editions. However, 4:3 graphics, title cards, and OBB didn't change. There was also a time that &lt;a href=\"One%20Sports\"&gt;Sports5&lt;/a&gt; used the studio for the announcement of the Gilas Pilipinas line-up prior to the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in July (with the Philippines as one of the host countries).\nOn July 15, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Cherie%20Mercado\"&gt;Cherie Mercado&lt;/a&gt; left the newscast after six years with TV5 (from Aksyon Weekend, Aksyon JournalisMO, Pilipinas News, to Aksyon sa Tanghali), after she was appointed as the Press Officer and spokesperson to the newly created &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Transportation%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;. She, went to a private life with her family after resigning from her post in May the following year. In 2018, she was hired by &lt;a href=\"CNN%20Philippines\"&gt;CNN Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (a local franchise of CNN which, ironically, became TV5's former partner in sharing international news content via AksyonTV's defunct \"&lt;a href=\"CNN%20Konek\"&gt;CNN Konek&lt;/a&gt;\") to anchor the late evening edition of &lt;a href=\"CNN%20Philippines%20Newsroom\"&gt;Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Mitzi Borromeo who'll leave the channel to pursue an advance degree in college.\nFollowing her departure, Aksyon was downgraded to single-presenter format by August 1. Cheryl Cosim retained her role to the morning newscast, but she left her co-presenter of \"Aksyon Tonite\" Ed Lingao who went solo for a week until Roices Naguit took over Cosim's vacated anchor's chair on the Late Night Edition in the height of the network's coverage to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2016 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. More than two months later, on October 17, the edition's segment anchor &lt;a href=\"Lia%20Cruz\"&gt;Lia Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and former Aksyon sa Tanghali segment anchor Marga Vargas are named as new rotating co-anchors to Lingao. The primetime edition however, was spared from these changes and continued to be co-anchored by Valdez and Tulfo during the time.\nOn December 1, 2016, \"Aksyon sa Umaga\" began its simulcast on Radyo5 until 6:00 AM. The move was made after News5 axed Balita Alas Singko on weekdays which ended on November 30. However, the Saturday and Sunday editions of Balita Alas Singko still continues to air because it occupies both on Radyo5 and AksyonTV and considering to be the only news content of News5 on weekends. However, it cannot be seen on TV5 because of its radio booth format with no field reporters and video reports.\nOn December 19, 2016, the newscast's graphic package gained rounded edges (in exception in the flipper) with orange as the standard color. It was initially used in the morning and early evening editions before implementing on the rest of the newscast. The color is now similar with their &lt;a href=\"Cignal\"&gt;Cignal&lt;/a&gt; business channel &lt;a href=\"Bloomberg%20TV%20Philippines\"&gt;Bloomberg TV Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn January 9, 2017, Aksyon Prime extended its runtime every Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays to 75 minutes, with Aksyon sa Tanghali extending its runtime to a full hour seven days before the main edition. However, Aksyon Prime was scaled back to 60 minutes by February 23.\nOn March 31, 2017, Erwin Tulfo and News5 management reached an agreement for the former to left Aksyon Prime, leaving his radio program Punto Asintado the remaining News5 program he hosted on, as well as occasional appearances with his brother &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Tulfo\"&gt;Ben Tulfo&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Kilos%20Pronto\"&gt;Kilos Pronto&lt;/a&gt;\" (a blocktime public-service show produced by \"Bitag Media\" for government-owned &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Television%20Network\"&gt;PTV&lt;/a&gt;). Although personal concerns were the main reason for his departure to the newscast, several rumors have surrounded that it was due to his &lt;a href=\"Duterte%20Diehard%20Supporters\"&gt;strong opinion stance leaning towards&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"Rodrigo%20Duterte\"&gt;Rodrigo Duterte&lt;/a&gt;, which was deemed sensitive to tackle for most Filipinos, particularly to members of the media (such as criticizing anti-Duterte supporter &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Paredes\"&gt;Jim Paredes&lt;/a&gt; on the DDS rally in Luneta during the 31st anniversary of &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Revolution\"&gt;EDSA I&lt;/a&gt; and Ed Lingao's criticisms to his opinion about opposition Sen. &lt;a href=\"Risa%20Hontiveros\"&gt;Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt; interview with &lt;a href=\"UNTV%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;UNTV&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Get%20It%20Straight%20with%20Daniel%20Razon\"&gt;Get It Straight with Daniel Razon&lt;/a&gt;\" regarding the &lt;a href=\"Marawi%20crisis\"&gt;ongoing crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Marawi\"&gt;Marawi&lt;/a&gt; that has been a subject of \"fake news\"). Tulfo finally left TV5 on June 29, a day after Valdes returned from a month-long vacation. His brother Ben, meanwhile, revealed that she had been uncomfortable to work with Tulfo, which could have led to his departure with the network. As a result of the online word war, TV5 was \"disappointed\" and gave disciplinary action on Ed, Erwin and Ben on June 30, with details not being revealed to the public. On July 16, Tulfo was appointed to the public radio station &lt;a href=\"DZRB-AM\"&gt;Radyo Pilipinas One&lt;/a&gt; for his own radio program, \"Erwin Tulfo Live\" which began the following day. Few months later, on September 17, Tulfo was also named as PTV's full-time news anchor, presenting the flagship &lt;a href=\"PTV%20News%20%28TV%20program%29\"&gt;PTV News&lt;/a&gt; which also began the following day.\nSeries of possible budget cuts forced Aksyon sa Umaga to reduce its airing time to 75 minutes from June 5; followed by Aksyon Prime on July 3, when it shortened its airing time to its original 45 minutes. As a compromise for the latter, however, News5 offered a separate online streaming on News5 Everywhere and News5's Facebook Live, where it can continue to run beyond its television broadcast. The said extension was discontinued months later.\nReformat and major changes made by ESPN5's launch (2017\u20132020).\nNew soundtrack, openers, title cards and transition graphics (except Aksyon sa Umaga) were refreshed across all editions by August 14, 2017, replacing its 2014 version. The morning edition also replaced the AksyonTV theme with the new Aksyon soundtrack.\nOn September 4, 2017, Aksyon sa Umaga reduced its airtime from 75 minutes to 60 minutes to give way to some programming changes within the network.\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced its partnership agreement between the network and US-based sports television network &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to Philippine television after a 5-year long hiatus. Thus the former Sports5 rebranded as ESPN5 a day after, during the coverage of Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Governor's Cup Finals between the &lt;a href=\"Barangay%20Ginebra%20San%20Miguel\"&gt;Barangay Ginebra San Miguel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Meralco%20Bolts\"&gt;Meralco Bolts&lt;/a&gt;. The new sports deal showed drastic changes within News5 and Aksyon: \"Aksyon sa Umaga\" was axed for good on November 3 to give way for the upcoming ESPN US' primetime programming simulcast overnight. This ended Cheryl Cosim's role as the main anchor of a News5 newscast after 7 years, although she continues radio duties at Radyo5 as well as filling-in for Cruz-Valdes on the primetime edition. Weekend \"Aksyon News Alert\" bulletins were also axed as part of the sports division's expansion. Also, since November 6, during daylight saving time, \"Aksyon sa Tanghali\" adjusted its timeslot to 12:30 PM, every Monday, Tuesday, &amp; Friday (to accommodate live coverage of the US &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;) with a more public service focus along with reading the day's Main Headlines. \"Aksyon Tonite\" also cutback its airtime to 15 minutes by November 6. Presenter changes in the newscast also occurred, as Lia Cruz left the newscast three days earlier to join ESPN5's new on air talents, while Marga Vargas moved back to \"Aksyon sa Tanghali\" a week after; leaving Ed Lingao as the main solo presenter for the newscast.\nWeeks after these changes, News5 chief Luchi Cruz-Valdes made an indefinite absence on Aksyon Prime. Ed Lingao and Cheryl Cosim temporarily replaced Luchi Cruz-Valdes in the newscast. Cosim served as the main anchor of the primetime edition from its inception In 2010 until 2014. While Lingao is on the primetime edition, News5 correspondent Maricel Halili took Lingao's post as sit-in anchor for Aksyon Tonite.\nOn December 11, 2017, the newscast had a minor change on their studio set-up and a newsdesk, which was previously used by now-defunct News5 program \"&lt;a href=\"Reaksyon\"&gt;Reaksyon&lt;/a&gt;\". The newscast also shares its set with \"&lt;a href=\"SportsCenter%20Philippines\"&gt;SportsCenter Philippines&lt;/a&gt;\" of ESPN5 and \"The Big Story\" of &lt;a href=\"Bloomberg%20TV%20Philippines\"&gt;Bloomberg TV Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (before it was moved to newly launched &lt;a href=\"One%20News%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;One News&lt;/a&gt; studio as the newscast was relaunched in the news channel). Aksyon Tonite also moved its timeslot at 11:00 PM to also give way to the said sports newscast. The said edition also re-extended its broadcast by 15 minutes.\nOn January 10, 2018, Aksyon Prime reduced airtime by 15 minutes on a PBA game day. This is due to adjustment of the PBA broadcast schedule which starts at 4:30 PM, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The runtime remains the same for the non-PBA game days.\nOn March 21, 2018, the noontime and primetime edition began airing on weekday mornings at 5:00 AM as a replay telecast, serving as the morning timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga.\nDuring the third week of April, \"Aksyon sa Tanghali\" was given a Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) rating by the MTRCB due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\nOn July 2, 2018, after her almost 7 months of absence, \"Aksyon Prime\" main anchor Luchi Cruz-Valdes returns in the newscast, joining Ed Lingao, who serves as one of the sit-in presenters while she was on her leave. Meanwhile, another sit-in anchor Cheryl Cosim made a comeback to \"Aksyon Tonite\" as main anchor. Cosim permanently replaced Lingao, who also been her former co-anchor in the late-night edition.\nOn January 14, 2019, upon the rebranding of &lt;a href=\"AksyonTV\"&gt;AksyonTV&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"5%20Plus\"&gt;5 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=\"One%20Sports%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;One Sports&lt;/a&gt;, \"Aksyon Prime\"'s simulcast on the channel was axed to give way to the channel's repositioning as an all-sports channel. However, the audio simulcast on Radyo5 remains intact, with added TV presence on a standalone Cignal channel of the same name, which is also aired on selected UHF free TV stations run by the radio station's owner, &lt;a href=\"Nation%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Nation Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 11, 2019, Aksyon Tonite moved its timeslot at 10:30 PM, to give way for the special program as part of News5's coverage of the 2019 mid-term elections, \"Aplikante sa Senado\".\nOn February 18, 2019, Aksyon Primetime began simulcasting on One PH, a \"teleradyo\" channel of Radyo5, on Cignal TV channel 6. Four days later, News5 announced that Aksyon Tonite will be replaced by a rebroadcast of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Story%20%28TV%20program%29\"&gt;The Big Story&lt;/a&gt;\", the flagship newscast of 5's sister English news channel &lt;a href=\"One%20News%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;One News&lt;/a&gt; starting March 4.\nOn July 15, 2019, \"Aksyon Prime\" began airing a replay once again at 6:15 AM every weekday morning. It serves as a replacement for the timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga and the \"Kids on 5\" block. The replay once again ended after a month. It was replaced by a simulcast of &lt;a href=\"DWFM\"&gt;Radyo5&lt;/a&gt;'s Morning Calls.\nOn September 23, 2019, \"Aksyon Prime\" re-extends its broadcast to 60 minutes during non-PBA game days. In accordance with the changes, \"Aksyon\" airs at 6:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Its PBA game day timeslot remains unchanged. These changes were brought about by 5's expansion of its news content through programs from sister station &lt;a href=\"One%20PH\"&gt;One PH&lt;/a&gt;; like its newscast service \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Balita\"&gt;One Balita&lt;/a&gt;\" and late night talk show &lt;a href=\"Radyo5%2092.3%20News%20FM\"&gt;\"Wag Po!\"&lt;/a&gt;. Weeks prior to the change, Aksyon Prime had already reintroduced their online-only extension on \"News5 Always On\". Although, it is only aired on an occasional basis.\nFinal editions.\nAksyon (Primetime Edition).\nStart time differences.\nThe primetime edition is promoted to air at 6:30 PM on weeknights, with some exceptions. In almost every PBA game day, the newscast would start at or after 6:30 PM on 5 to allow the afternoon PBA game to end with the final score of the match. Start time is also subjected to change outside PBA games, only if necessary.\nAksyon sa Tanghali (Noontime Edition).\nThe one-hour midday edition of the newscast is aired Weekdays from 12:30 to 1:30 pm, and is presented by &lt;a href=\"Raffy%20Tulfo\"&gt;Raffy Tulfo&lt;/a&gt; (who also hosts his \"Ipa-Raffy Tulfo Mo\" segment (formerly called as \"Itimbre Mo Kay Tulfo\"), a spin off from \"&lt;a href=\"Wanted%20sa%20Radyo\"&gt;Wanted sa Radyo&lt;/a&gt;\") with Marga Vargas presenting news segment \"Balita 1.2.3.\" This edition always changes the schedule since the launch, due to blocktime programming or competing with other noontime newscasts. In 2018, it holds the reputation of being the only SPG-rated newscast in the country due to its public service format which they are featuring some sensitive complaints, and profanity which cannot be censored in a live program. During Daylight time changes from November\u2013December, in order to accommodate NFL games, the show airs at 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm instead.\nFormat changes.\nOn November 6, 2017, this edition has largely abandoned its newscast format and adopted a public service format, which occasionally serves as extension of Wanted sa Radyo.
