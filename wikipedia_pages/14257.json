    "text": "\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is a song sung by &lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Knight%20%28Through%20the%20Looking%20Glass%29\"&gt;The White Knight&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Carroll\"&gt;Lewis Carroll&lt;/a&gt;'s 1871 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Looking-Glass\"&gt;Through the Looking-Glass&lt;/a&gt;\", .\n\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is an example used to elaborate on the symbolic status of the concept of \"&lt;a href=\"name\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;\": a name as identification marker may be assigned to anything, including another name, thus introducing different levels of symbolization. It has been discussed in several works on logic and philosophy.\nNaming.\nThe White Knight explains to Alice a confusing nomenclature for the song.\nTo summarize:\nThe complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the &lt;a href=\"use%E2%80%93mention%20distinction\"&gt;use\u2013mention distinction&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe song.\nThe White Knight sings the song to a tune he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Heart%20and%20Lute\"&gt;I give thee all, I can no more&lt;/a&gt;\". By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.\nThe song parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of \"&lt;a href=\"Resolution%20and%20Independence\"&gt;Resolution and Independence&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"William%20Wordsworth\"&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the Lonely Moor.\nLike \"&lt;a href=\"Jabberwocky\"&gt;Jabberwocky&lt;/a&gt;,\" another poem published in \"Through the Looking Glass,\" \"Haddocks\u2019 Eyes\" appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name \"Upon the Lonely Moor\". It bears an obvious resemblance to \"Haddocks' Eyes.\""
