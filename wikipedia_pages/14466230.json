    "text": "Commelina diffusa, sometimes known as the climbing dayflower or spreading dayflower, is a &lt;a href=\"pantropical\"&gt;pantropical&lt;/a&gt; herbaceous plant in the &lt;a href=\"Commelinaceae\"&gt;dayflower family&lt;/a&gt;. It has been introduced to the southeastern &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; where it is most common in wet disturbed soils. There are two recognised varieties, one being the type and the other being \"C. diffusa\" var. \"gigas\", which is native to &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and has been introduced to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. It flowers from spring to fall and is most common in disturbed situations, moist places and forests. In &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; the plant is used medicinally as a &lt;a href=\"febrifuge\"&gt;febrifuge&lt;/a&gt; and a diuretic. A blue dye is also extracted from the flower for paints. In the Hawaiian Islands, it is known as \"honohono grass\", although it is technically not a grass. \"Honohono\" refers to the alternating structure of the leaves. At least one publication lists it as an edible plant in New Guinea.\nDescription.\n\"Commelina diffusa\" is typically an annual herb, though it may be &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; in the tropics. It spreads diffusely, creeping along the ground, branching heavily and rooting at the &lt;a href=\"Node%20%28botany%29\"&gt;nodes&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining stem lengths up to 1 metre. Pubescence on the stem is variable and ranges from glabrous to hispidulous, which can occur either in a line or throughout. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaf&lt;/a&gt; blades are relatively variable, ranging from lanceolate to ovate, with proximal leaves tending to be more oblong. They measure 3 to 12\u00a0cm in length by 0.8 to 3\u00a0cm in width. North American populations tend to have smaller leaf size, typically measuring 1.5 to 5\u00a0cm, by 0.5 by 1.8\u00a0cm. The leaf apex is acute to acuminate. The leaf surface can be either glabrous (i.e. hairless) or hispid (i.e. bristly). The leaves are subsessile (i.e. having a very small &lt;a href=\"petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt;) with a leaf sheath striped with red and covered with hispid pubescence.\nThe &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are arranged into cincinni (singular: cincinnus), or scorpioid &lt;a href=\"Cyme%20%28botany%29\"&gt;cymes&lt;/a&gt;. This is a form of a monochasium where the lateral branches arise alternately on opposite sides of the false axis. There are typically two cincinni present, with the lower cincinnus bearing 2 to 4 flowers, while the upper cincinnus has one to several flowers. The upper cincinnus is generally exerted on specimens with larger &lt;a href=\"spathe\"&gt;spathe&lt;/a&gt;s, but it may be included in specimens with smaller spathes. The upper cincinnus bears only male flowers and has a longer peduncle, while the lower cincinnus bears bisexual flowers on a shorter peduncle. The &lt;a href=\"Pedicel%20%28botany%29\"&gt;pedicel&lt;/a&gt;s supporting single flowers, and later the fruits, are thick and curved and measure about 3 to 5\u00a0mm. The membranous &lt;a href=\"sepal\"&gt;sepal&lt;/a&gt;s are inconspicuous at only 3 to 4\u00a0mm in length. The &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s are blue, though may be lavender in rare cases. The upper two petals measure 4.2 to 6\u00a0mm. The &lt;a href=\"anther\"&gt;anther&lt;/a&gt; connective (i.e. the tissue connecting the two halves of the anther) of the centre-most &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt; has a broad transverse band of violet. The spathes are solitary, borne on a &lt;a href=\"Peduncle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;peduncle&lt;/a&gt; and typically falcate (i.e. sickle-shaped) with a cordate (i.e. heart-shaped) to rounded base, acuminate apices and can be either glabrous or hispidulous (i.e. minutely hispid) beneath. They usually measure 0.8 to 2.5\u00a0cm long, but may be as short as 0.5\u00a0cm and as long as 4\u00a0cm. They are typically 0.4 by 1.2\u00a0cm wide, but may be up to 1.4\u00a0cm long. Their peduncles are usually 0.5 to 2\u00a0cm long and rarely up to 2.9\u00a0cm. Flowering occurs from May to November. Pollens are elongated with bilateral symmetry, approximate size is 73 microns.\nThe fruit is a &lt;a href=\"Capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsule&lt;/a&gt; which has three &lt;a href=\"locules\"&gt;locules&lt;/a&gt; and 2 valves. It measures 4 to 6.3\u00a0mm long by 3 to 4\u00a0mm wide, though it may be as narrow as 2.1\u00a0mm. They contain five brown seeds that are 2 to 2.8, rarely up to 3.2\u00a0mm long, by 1.4 to 1.8\u00a0mm wide. They are deeply reticulate (i.e. net-like). The &lt;a href=\"chromosome\"&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt; number is 2n = 30.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe plant is present in tropical and subtropical locations worldwide. It can be found throughout much of southern &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Guangdong\"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt;, southwestern &lt;a href=\"Guangxi\"&gt;Guangxi&lt;/a&gt;, southwestern &lt;a href=\"Guizhou\"&gt;Guizhou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hainan\"&gt;Hainan&lt;/a&gt;, southeastern &lt;a href=\"Xizang\"&gt;Xizang&lt;/a&gt; and southeastern &lt;a href=\"Yunnan\"&gt;Yunnan&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; the plant has been reported from &lt;a href=\"Yakushima\"&gt;Yakushima&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB\"&gt;Ky\u016bsh\u016b&lt;/a&gt; and is also present in the &lt;a href=\"Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Amami%20%C5%8Cshima\"&gt;Amami \u014cshima&lt;/a&gt; southwards.\nIt is native in parts of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;, including much of &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and several of the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;Saint Croix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;Saint Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tortola\"&gt;Tortola&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been introduced to the southeastern &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; where it is present from &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in the north, west to &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and south to &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been introduced to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, where it is a common and quickly spreading weed. The variety \"C. diffusa\" var. \"gigas\" has been introduced to &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn China it can be found from sea level up to 2100 metres, and is typically associated with forests, thickets, stream banks and other open and humid habitats. In the West Indies it is a common &lt;a href=\"weed\"&gt;weed&lt;/a&gt; that is especially associated with roadsides, moist ditches and waste places and it can be found from sea level to 1050 metres. In the United States it is also typical of disturbed locations, such as gardens, cultivated areas and lawns, but can also be found in woods and other moist situations.\nUses.\nWithin China, \"Commelina diffusa\" is used as a medicinal herb with febrifugal and diuretic effects. A dye is also obtained from the juice of the petals for use in painting.\nWithin Hawaii, \"honohono grass\" was used as medicine to aid with deep cuts. While other Hawaiian herbs just get superficial cuts, honohono grass is an herb to aid with deeper troubling issues.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20110927071039/http%3A//www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/french/03.pdf\"&gt;a work by Bruce French published on papuaweb.org&lt;/a&gt;, the young leaf tips are cooked and eaten in New Guinea.
