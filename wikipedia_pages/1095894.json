    "text": "Sir Richard Maitland of &lt;a href=\"Lethington\"&gt;Lethington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thirlestane%20Castle\"&gt;Thirlstane&lt;/a&gt; (1496 \u2013 1 August 1586) was a Senator of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Justice\"&gt;College of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, an Ordinary Lord of Session from 1561 until 1584, and notable Scottish poet. He was served heir to his father, Sir William Maitland of Lethington, &lt;a href=\"East%20Lothian\"&gt;East Lothian&lt;/a&gt;, and Thirlestane, &lt;a href=\"Berwickshire\"&gt;Berwickshire&lt;/a&gt;, on 15 October 1515, his father being one of the casualties at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Flodden\"&gt;Battle of Flodden&lt;/a&gt;. He held the political office of &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Great%20Seal%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and was also the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Privy%20Seal%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, from 1563 to 1567, and was succeeded in this post by his son Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Maitland%2C%201st%20Lord%20Maitland%20of%20Thirlestane\"&gt;John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his later years he was &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt;, and occupied himself by writing a history of \"The House and Surname of Seaton\", and by writing poems, e.g.,\u00a0\"On the New Year\", \"On the Queene's Maryage\", etc. He held various offices, chiefly legal, but appears to have kept as far as possible out of the fierce political struggles of his time, and to have been a genially &lt;a href=\"satirical\"&gt;satirical&lt;/a&gt; humorist.\nHe married Mariotta (or Margaret) (d. March 1586), daughter of Sir Thomas Cranstoun of &lt;a href=\"Corsbie%20Castle\"&gt;Corsbie&lt;/a&gt;, in Berwickshire. They had three sons and four daughters, including\nThe Maitland Manuscripts.\nTwo of Maitland's &lt;a href=\"Maitland%20Manuscripts\"&gt;manuscript works&lt;/a&gt; survive; both are compilations of the &lt;a href=\"Scots%20language\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; literature of his era. They preserve many of the works of the great &lt;a href=\"makars\"&gt;makars&lt;/a&gt; and a large number of anonymous pieces. The manuscripts also record many of Maitland's own compositions. Maitland's daughter &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Maitland\"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; transcribed his poems as well as her brother John Maitland's and others.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maitland%20Manuscripts\"&gt;Maitland Manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; are held by the &lt;a href=\"Pepys%20Library\"&gt;Pepys Library&lt;/a&gt;."
