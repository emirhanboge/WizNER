    "text": "c-base e.V. is a non-profit &lt;a href=\"Non-profit%20organization\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Berlin%2C%20Germany\"&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose is to increase knowledge and skills pertaining to &lt;a href=\"computer%20software\"&gt;computer software&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Computer%20hardware\"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"computer%20networks\"&gt;data networks&lt;/a&gt;. The association is engaged in numerous related activities. For example, the society has had stands at large festivals, such as &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Day\"&gt;Children's Day&lt;/a&gt;, where they introduce young people to topics like &lt;a href=\"robotics\"&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"computer-aided%20design\"&gt;computer-aided design&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe association's headquarters, c-base station, is also used by other initiatives and groups in and around Berlin as an event location or as function rooms, for example the &lt;a href=\"wireless%20community%20network\"&gt;wireless community network&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freifunk\"&gt;freifunk.net&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Computer%20Club\"&gt;Chaos Computer Club&lt;/a&gt; and the Berlin Wikipedia group. Any group that identifies themselves with the purpose of the c-base are also welcome to use the premises for meetings and events.\nHistory.\nSeventeen people founded c-base e. V. in the autumn of 1995. In the years 2002 and 2003 the BerlinBackBone project was launched to make available and promote free public access to the internet via wireless community networks. Also in 2003 the c-base association began staging weekly meetings of musicians, called Cosmic Open Stage, thus providing a platform for well known or unknown musicians to hold &lt;a href=\"jam%20session\"&gt;jam session&lt;/a&gt;s or to give concerts. Since 2004 the premises of the c-base association are also used in cooperation by &lt;a href=\"transmediale\"&gt;transmediale&lt;/a&gt;.\nc-base is recognized as one of the first &lt;a href=\"hackerspace\"&gt;hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;s in the world. It, along with &lt;a href=\"Metalab\"&gt;Metalab&lt;/a&gt;, directly influenced the creation of hackerspaces in the US.\nActivities.\nApart from the main purpose of the c-base association the members are also engaged in many other activities, for example &lt;a href=\"Go%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jugger\"&gt;Jugger&lt;/a&gt;, the rules of which supposedly were gained through analysis of files on c-beam, the main computer in the c-base station. Once a year, @c-terra, an event organised by the c-base association, gives an overview of all activities offered.\nThe premises of the c-base association host a lot of different events (parties, presentations, theatrical performances, concerts and art exhibitions), such as Cosmic Open Stage.\nThe c-base society is also present at events of the Chaos Computer Club like the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Communication%20Congress\"&gt;Chaos Communication Congress&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Communication%20Camp\"&gt;Chaos Communication Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom September 14\u201316, 2006 the fourth &lt;a href=\"Wizards%20of%20OS\"&gt;Wizards of OS&lt;/a&gt; conference was held in cooperation with c-base.\nMythological self-image of the c-base.\nThe location for c-base is accompanied by a myth. This myth says that there are remnants of a space station called c-base underneath the city centre of Berlin. The space station's antenna is the &lt;a href=\"Fernsehturm%20Berlin\"&gt;Fernsehturm Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, a large spire with a mirrored ball near the top and a distinctive landmark nearby.\nHistory of the space station.\nAccording to the stories of the members of the c-base, the space station crashed due to unstable conditions in its orbit after exiting a time warp. At that time there was a number of highly technological advanced and heretofore undiscovered lifeforms aboard the station. Much evidence of its existence is said to be in and around Berlin, including the aforementioned antenna, which was (according to stories) unmasked by &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; scientists. Other evidence, such as the multifunctional space station module, which ejected during the crash, is now under intense research and makes up the current premises of the c-base association.\nThere is currently only a printed edition of the collected knowledge about the space station, known as the \"space almanack\" (Ger.: \"Allmanach\"). A project, called \"c-pedia\", is currently underway, attempting to make this knowledge available on the internet. There is also a reconstruction of station artifacts taking place.\nStructure of c-base.\nThe c-base is a system of seven concentric rings that can move in relation to one another. Each ring is considered a single module with a special set of functions. The rings are called (from the centre out) \"core\", \"com\", \"culture\", \"creactiv\", \"cience\", \"carbon\" and \"clamp\".\nThe inner ring, core, provides a nonterminating supply of energy produced by a &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6bius%20strip\"&gt;M\u00f6bius strip&lt;/a&gt; generator. The central computer of the c-base, \"c-beam\", is also located there. The second ring, com, harbours the space ports, hangars and communication devices including the interstellar communication module recently identified as &lt;a href=\"Project%20Blinkenlights\"&gt;Blinkenlights&lt;/a&gt; by the Chaos Computer Club. The following three rings, culture, creactiv and cience, host devices serving culture, creativity and science. The latter ring is also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;. Accommodation for station crew members are found on the carbon ring. The outer ring, clamp, stabilizes the station."
