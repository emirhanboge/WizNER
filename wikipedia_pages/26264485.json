The ships displaced at &lt;a href=\"deep%20load\"&gt;deep load&lt;/a&gt;. Their crew numbered 77\u201379 officers and men.\n\"Mameluk\" was powered by two &lt;a href=\"Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engines&lt;/a&gt;, each driving one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt; using steam provided by four &lt;a href=\"du%20Temple%20boiler\"&gt;du Temple boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The engines were designed to produce which was intended to give the \"Spahi\" class a speed of . During her &lt;a href=\"sea%20trial\"&gt;sea trial&lt;/a&gt;s, \"Mameluk\" reached a speed of . The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .\nThe primary armament of the \"Spahi\"-class ships consisted of six &lt;a href=\"Canon%20de%2065%20mm%20Mod%C3%A8le%201891\"&gt;Mod\u00e8le 1902&lt;/a&gt; guns in single mounts, one each fore and aft of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; and the others were distributed &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;. They were also fitted with three &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s. One of these was in a fixed mount in the &lt;a href=\"bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and the other two were on single rotating mounts amidships.\nConstruction and career.\n\"Mameluk\" was ordered from &lt;a href=\"Ateliers%20et%20Chantiers%20de%20la%20Loire\"&gt;Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20launching%20and%20naming\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; on 13 March 1908. She was completed in June 1911.\nTasked with escort duties in the Mediterranean \"Mameluck\" was assigned to the 1st Squadron in June 1911, and a year later she was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Squadron, of the 1st Fleet. In March 1913 she was assigned to torpedo squadron patrols and to support submarines in the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mameluck\" rammed the French destroyer \"&lt;a href=\"French%20destroyer%20Fantassin\"&gt;Fantassin&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Ionian%20Sea\"&gt;Ionian Sea&lt;/a&gt; on 5 June 1915, so badly damaging \"Fantassin\" that the French destroyer consequently scuttled her.\nIn 1916, \"Mameluck\" escorted the &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s \"Faraday\" and \"Le Verrier\" to &lt;a href=\"Milo%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Milo&lt;/a&gt;. On 14 December 1917, along with \"Lansquenet\", she sank the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Lefkada\"&gt;Cape Ducato&lt;/a&gt; in the Ionian Sea after the submarine &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;ed and sunk the French &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; .\n\"Mameluck\" was sold for scrap in 1928."
