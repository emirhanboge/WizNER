Knickknack was later recruited as the fourth member of the group. Oddball, given to his eccentric behaviour, quit the Death-Throws and branched out on his own. Oddball was hired, along with Bombshell, by &lt;a href=\"Crossfire%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Crossfire&lt;/a&gt; to battle &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20%28Clint%20Barton%29\"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mockingbird%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;. The two supervillains subdued the heroes and delivered them to Crossfire. Later, when Hawkeye had managed to escape, Bombshell, Oddball and Crossfire were defeated and handed over to the authorities. Bombshell and Oddball were broken out of prison by Oddball's brother, Tenpin, and became members of the Death-Throws.\nOddball was contacted by Crossfire to break him out of prison. The Death-Throws took the job and were successful in their mission. But when Crossfire couldn't pay them for their services, the Death-Throws held him for ransom to lure Hawkeye into an ambush. The team were later defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America\"&gt;Captain America&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, Crossfire placed a bounty on archer's right arm as he attempted to gain revenge against Hawkeye. The Death-Throws (along with the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20Grimm%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Brothers Grimm&lt;/a&gt;, Bobcat, Bullet Biker, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Dog%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Mad Dog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Fist\"&gt;Razor Fist&lt;/a&gt;) looked to cash in on the reward. The group, along with the rest of the supervillains, were defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and &lt;a href=\"Trick%20Shot%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Trick Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nJohnny Guitar and Doctor Sax, who were minor supervillains known for battling &lt;a href=\"Dazzler%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Dazzler&lt;/a&gt;, later applied for membership into the Death-Throws. However, the two music-themed supervillains were quickly rejected on the basis that they couldn't juggle.\nGoing solo.\nBombshell underwent a genetic experiment to gain superpowers. She gained the ability to fire explosive energy blasts from her hands. Bombshell then joined an all female team of supervillains called the &lt;a href=\"Femizons\"&gt;Femizons&lt;/a&gt;. The team were later defeated by Captain America. Bombshell's experimental new powers soon faded. &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Hammer\"&gt;Justin Hammer&lt;/a&gt; hired a number of supervillains (including Bombshell) to battle &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Warriors\"&gt;New Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. Justin Hammer and the supervillains then allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Sphinx%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; When Sphinx revealed his true intentions of total world domination, Bombshell panicked and fled.\nAfter being seen playing a game of pool with &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20%28comics%29\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; in the Bar with No Name, Oddball was recruited by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Octopus\"&gt;Doctor Octopus&lt;/a&gt; to join his incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Masters of Evil&lt;/a&gt;. The team were quickly defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20%281969%20team%29\"&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. Oddball was later hired by Albino and &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt; to once again battle Hawkeye. He was defeated by the archer and the young &lt;a href=\"Avengers%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Avengers&lt;/a&gt; recruits &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Astrovik\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firestar%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Firestar&lt;/a&gt;. Oddball was later killed while taking part in the Bloodsport competition in &lt;a href=\"Madripoor\"&gt;Madripoor&lt;/a&gt;. He was slain in the first round of the tournament by a tribal warrior called the Headhunter.\n&lt;a href=\"S.H.I.E.L.D.\"&gt;S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/a&gt; reported that Knickknack was killed and resurrected to serve &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;HYDRA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Hand&lt;/a&gt; as part of their supervillain army. All the supervillains involved were released from the Hand's control and returned to normal.\nReturn as team.\nOrville Bock was hired by the Death-Throws to become the new Oddball, adopting the original Oddball's costume and trick juggling balls. The Death-Throws, along with &lt;a href=\"Crossfire%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Crossfire&lt;/a&gt;, were hired by &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Idea%20Mechanics%23Splinter%20groups\"&gt;R.A.I.D&lt;/a&gt; to take part in a terrorist attack on &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite gaining the upper hand early in the battle, the Death-Throws and Crossfire were soon defeated. Bombshell, the last member of the team left standing, defused her bombs and surrendered.\nThe Death-Throws were among the supervillains researched by &lt;a href=\"Quasimodo%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Quasimodo&lt;/a&gt;, on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goblin\"&gt;Norman Osborn&lt;/a&gt;, as potential villainous recruits for &lt;a href=\"H.A.M.M.E.R.\"&gt;H.A.M.M.E.R.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fifty%20State%20Initiative\"&gt;Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Knickknack later appeared as a member of &lt;a href=\"Hood%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Hood&lt;/a&gt;'s crime syndicate. Bombshell, along with her previous employer Crossfire, was hired to join &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Knight\"&gt;Misty Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s Villains for Hire team in a battle against the &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Man\"&gt;Purple Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nBombshell.\nBombshell juggles various anti-personnel weapons including hand grenades, stun grenades, and smoke bombs.\nKnickknack.\nNicholas \"Nick\" Grossman was born in &lt;a href=\"Secaucus%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Secaucus, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. He later became a circus performer and juggler. Grossman then went to become a juggling supervillain known as the Knickknack and a member of the supervillain team, the Death-Throws. Knickknack was hired along with the Death-Throws by &lt;a href=\"Crossfire%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Crossfire&lt;/a&gt; to help him escape from prison. The Death-Throws complete their mission, but decide to hold Crossfire hostage instead. The group are defeated and arrested by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America\"&gt;Captain America&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Knickknack and the rest of the Death-Throws, along with various other supervillains, attempt to claim the bounty put on Hawkeye's right arm by Crossfire. However, all of the supervillains looking to claim the bounty are defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and &lt;a href=\"Trick%20Shot%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Trick Shot&lt;/a&gt;.

However, deciding to leave behind the \"fifth rate hacks in ridiculous costumes\", Crossfire created a new army for himself. His \"Death T.H.R.O.W.S\". (Techno Hybrid Remotely Operated Weapons Systems) are robotic constructs that obey only his commands and each carry a small capable arsenal concealed within their armored shells. Crossfire used his Death T.H.R.O.W.S. to battle his old enemies &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20%28Clint%20Barton%29\"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mockingbird%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, the robotic Death T.H.R.O.W.S. were known as 'Magnum Z's'. The Magnum Z's were fully automated smart soldiers created for the United States. But the US senate ceased their development when they realised that the Magnum Z's abilities were in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Convention\"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt;. Crossfire acquired some of the defunct Magnum Z's to use in a plot to conquer the Isle of El Guapo, then later adapted them for his own purposes.\nOther versions.\nMini Marvels.\nThe Death-Throws make a cameo appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Mini%20Marvels\"&gt;Mini Marvels&lt;/a&gt; cartoon comic strip storyline \"Paperboy Showdown\" featured in \"Spidey and the Mini Marvels\" #1 (2003) and collected in \"Mini Marvels: Ultimate Collection\" (2009). The team can be seen playing basketball in the background in the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Bugle\"&gt;Daily Bugle&lt;/a&gt;'s paperboy training facility.\nSolo versions.\nVersions of Bombshell and Oddball have appeared in the \"Last Avengers Story\" #1-2 (1995) which is set in an alternative future. In the &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Marvel\"&gt;Ultimate Marvel&lt;/a&gt; universe, two characters appear using the Bombshell codename. The Bombshells are a mother/daughter team of criminals. Lori Baumgartner and her young daughter Lana are mutants whose powers are activated when they are close to one another. They have the ability to fire explosive energy beams from their hands. In their first appearance, the foul-mouthed Bombshells attempted to rob a bank vault but are foiled by Spider-Man. Later, they attempted to rob an armored truck until the Human Torch and Spider-Woman arrived on the scene and defeated them."
