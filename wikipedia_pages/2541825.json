    "text": "Russophilia (literally love of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;) is admiration and fondness of Russia (including the era of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20culture\"&gt;Russian culture&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"antonym\"&gt;antonym&lt;/a&gt; and opposite of Russophilia is &lt;a href=\"Anti-Russian%20sentiment\"&gt;Russophobia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRussophilia in Europe.\nAmerican author Robert Alexander wrote: \"I love Russians for their dramatic, emotional nature. They're not afraid to love, not afraid to get hurt, not afraid to exaggerate or act impulsively.\"\nIn October 2004, the &lt;a href=\"Gallup%20Poll\"&gt;International Gallup Organization&lt;/a&gt; announced the results of its poll, according to which approximately 20% of the residents of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt; viewed Russia positively, with the most positive view coming from &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. The percentage of respondents expressing a positive attitude towards Russia was 9% in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, 38% in &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, 36% in &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, and 34% in &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. Estonia and especially Latvia have a large number of ethnic Russians, which likely affected the result.\nRussophilia in Serbia.\nRussia is hugely popular in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt; have always traditionally seen Russia as a close ally due to shared &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; heritage, culture, and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox faith&lt;/a&gt;. Serbia and Montenegro are predominately &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, the faith expressed by a vast majority of Russians. There was little Soviet influence in the Balkans, so Russians were always seen as friendly brotherly people. According to European Council on Foreign Relations, 54% of Serbians see Russia as an ally. In comparison, 11% see European Union as an ally, and only 6% see United States in the same manner. In both Serbia and Montenegro, there are neighbourhoods, streets, buildings and statues named after something Russian. In Serbia there is the Russian Centre of Science and Culture and a &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Moskva%20%28Belgrade%29\"&gt;Hotel Moskva&lt;/a&gt;.\nRussophilia in Montenegro.\n&lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is also an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20people\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; country. There is the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20bridge\"&gt;Moscow Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Podgorica\"&gt;Podgorica&lt;/a&gt;, and a statue of Russian singer and actor &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Vysotsky\"&gt;Vladimir Vysotsky&lt;/a&gt; next to the bridge.\nRussophilia in Ukraine.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Modern%20history%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 Ukrainians, mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Ukraine\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Ukraine\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; of the country, voted to a see a more Russophile attitude of the government, ranging from closer economic partnership to full national union. Russia and Ukraine enjoyed especially close economic ties, while the Russophilic political party, the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Regions\"&gt;Party of Regions&lt;/a&gt;, became the largest party in the &lt;a href=\"Verkhovna%20Rada\"&gt;Verkhovna Rada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20Ukrainian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. It would remain a dominant force in Ukrainian politics, until the 2014 &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Ukrainian%20revolution\"&gt;Ukrainian Revolution.&lt;/a&gt; Following the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Ukrainian%20War\"&gt;2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, the overall attitude of Ukrainians towards Russia and Russians has become much more negative, with most Ukrainians favoring &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; membership. \n41% of Ukrainians have a \"good\" attitude towards Russians (42% negatively), while in general 54% of Russians have a positive attitude towards Ukraine, according to a recent survey of the country's population. As of 2021, there are such Russophile parties in Ukraine as the &lt;a href=\"Opposition%20Platform%20%E2%80%94%20For%20Life\"&gt;Opposition Platform \u2014 For Life&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Opposition%20Bloc\"&gt;Opposition Bloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Our%20Land%20%28Ukraine%29\"&gt;Our Land&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nashi%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Nashi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Shariy\"&gt;Party of Shariy&lt;/a&gt;. \nPro-Russian political parties.\nHistoric"
