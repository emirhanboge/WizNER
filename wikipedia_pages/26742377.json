    "text": "Yogi Bear is a &lt;a href=\"anthropomorphic%20animal\"&gt;anthropomorphic animal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fictional%20character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; who has appeared in numerous comic books, &lt;a href=\"cartoon%20series\"&gt;animated television shows&lt;/a&gt; and films. He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Huckleberry%20Hound%20Show\"&gt;The Huckleberry Hound Show&lt;/a&gt;\".\nYogi Bear was the first &lt;a href=\"breakout%20character\"&gt;breakout character&lt;/a&gt; in animated television; he was created by &lt;a href=\"Hanna-Barbera\"&gt;Hanna-Barbera&lt;/a&gt; and was eventually more popular than ostensible star &lt;a href=\"Huckleberry%20Hound\"&gt;Huckleberry Hound&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1961, he was given his own show, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Yogi%20Bear%20Show\"&gt;The Yogi Bear Show&lt;/a&gt;\", sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Kellogg%27s\"&gt;Kellogg's&lt;/a&gt;, which included the segments \"&lt;a href=\"Snagglepuss\"&gt;Snagglepuss&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Yakky%20Doodle\"&gt;Yakky Doodle&lt;/a&gt;\". \"&lt;a href=\"Hokey%20Wolf\"&gt;Hokey Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\" replaced his segment on \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\". A musical animated feature film, \"&lt;a href=\"Hey%20There%2C%20It%27s%20Yogi%20Bear%21\"&gt;Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!&lt;/a&gt;\", was released in 1964.\nYogi was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a &lt;a href=\"Detachable%20collar\"&gt;collar&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed animators to keep his body relatively static, redrawing only his head in each &lt;a href=\"Film%20frame\"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt; when he spokeone of the ways Hanna-Barbera cut costs, reducing the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000.\nPersonality.\nLike many Hanna-Barbera characters, Yogi's personality and mannerisms were based on a popular celebrity of the time. &lt;a href=\"Art%20Carney\"&gt;Art Carney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Honeymooners%23Edward%20Lillywhite%20%26quot%3BEd%26quot%3B%20Norton\"&gt;Ed Norton&lt;/a&gt; character on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Honeymooners\"&gt;The Honeymooners&lt;/a&gt;\" was said to be Yogi's inspiration; his voice mannerisms broadly mimic Carney as Norton. Carney, in turn, received influence from the &lt;a href=\"Borscht%20Belt\"&gt;Borscht Belt&lt;/a&gt; and comedians of &lt;a href=\"vaudeville\"&gt;vaudeville&lt;/a&gt;.\nYogi's name was similar to that of contemporary baseball star &lt;a href=\"Yogi%20Berra\"&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt;, who was known for his amusing quotes, such as \"half the lies they tell about me aren't true.\" Berra sued Hanna-Barbera for defamation, but their management claimed the similarity was just coincidence. Berra withdrew his suit, but the defense was considered implausible. At the time Yogi Bear first hit TV screens, Yogi Berra was a &lt;a href=\"celebrity\"&gt;household name&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plot of most of Yogi's cartoons centered on his antics in the fictional Jellystone Park, a variant of the real &lt;a href=\"Yellowstone%20National%20Park\"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Yogi, accompanied by his constant companion &lt;a href=\"Boo-Boo%20Bear\"&gt;Boo-Boo Bear&lt;/a&gt;, would often try to steal picnic baskets from campers in the park, much to the displeasure of Park &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Smith\"&gt;Ranger Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Yogi's girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Cindy%20Bear\"&gt;Cindy Bear&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes appeared and usually disapproved of Yogi's antics.\nCatchphrases.\nBesides often speaking in &lt;a href=\"rhyme\"&gt;rhyme&lt;/a&gt;, Yogi Bear had a number of &lt;a href=\"catchphrase\"&gt;catchphrase&lt;/a&gt;s, including his famous chant of excitement and greeting (\"Hey, Hey, Hey\"), his &lt;a href=\"pet%20name\"&gt;pet name&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"picnic%20baskets\"&gt;picnic baskets&lt;/a&gt; (\"pic-a-nic baskets\"), and his favorite self-promotion (\"I'm smarter than the av-er-age bear!\"), although he often overestimates his own cleverness. Another characteristic of Yogi was his deep and silly voice. He often greets the ranger with a cordial, \"Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir!\" and \"Hey there, Boo Boo!\" as his preferred greeting to his &lt;a href=\"sidekick\"&gt;sidekick&lt;/a&gt;, Boo Boo. Yogi would also often use puns in his speech and had a habit of pronouncing large words with a long vocal flourish.\nVoice actors.\nFrom the time of the character's debut until 1988, Yogi was voiced by voice actor &lt;a href=\"Daws%20Butler\"&gt;Daws Butler&lt;/a&gt;. Butler died in 1988; his last performance as Yogi was in the television film \"&lt;a href=\"Yogi%20and%20the%20Invasion%20of%20the%20Space%20Bears\"&gt;Yogi and the Invasion of the Space Bears&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1983, a Yogi Bear balloon made its first appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Macy%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Day%20Parade\"&gt;Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the final balloon that year. That same year, he appeared on a float named \"A Hanna-Barbera Christmas\" alongside many other Hanna-Barbera characters, as they cleaned up the streets of Broadway. The performance was bookended with animated segments featuring Yogi and Boo-Boo, voiced by &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Blanc\"&gt;Mel Blanc&lt;/a&gt; and Butler, respectively.\nAfter Butler's death in 1988, &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Burson\"&gt;Greg Burson&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to perform the role; Butler had taught Burson personally how to voice Yogi as well as his other characters. Worsening alcoholism and a legal incident led to Burson's firing in 2004 and eventually his death in 2008.\nYogi's current voice actor is &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Bergman\"&gt;Jeff Bergman&lt;/a&gt;. Bergman and &lt;a href=\"Billy%20West\"&gt;Billy West&lt;/a&gt; also performed the character throughout the 1990s and early to mid-2000s for various &lt;a href=\"Cartoon%20Network\"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boomerang%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;Boomerang&lt;/a&gt; commercials and bumpers.\nAustralian voice actor, animation historian and impressionist &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Scott%20%28voice%20actor%29\"&gt;Keith Scott&lt;/a&gt; provided Yogi's voice in a &lt;a href=\"Pauls%20%28dairy%29\"&gt;Pauls&lt;/a&gt; commercial and the live show \"Hanna-Barbera Gala Celebrity Night\" at the &lt;a href=\"Wonderland%20Sydney\"&gt;Wonderland Sydney&lt;/a&gt; amusement park in Australia, where Yogi and other &lt;a href=\"Hanna-Barbera\"&gt;Hanna-Barbera&lt;/a&gt; characters including &lt;a href=\"Huckleberry%20Hound\"&gt;Huckleberry Hound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scooby-Doo\"&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Jetson\"&gt;George Jetson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Flintstone\"&gt;Fred Flintstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barney%20Rubble\"&gt;Barney Rubble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wilma%20Flintstone\"&gt;Wilma Flintstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Betty%20Rubble\"&gt;Betty Rubble&lt;/a&gt; make guest appearances.\nIn the 2010 \"&lt;a href=\"Yogi%20Bear%20%28film%29\"&gt;Yogi Bear&lt;/a&gt;\" film, the character is voiced by actor &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Aykroyd\"&gt;Dan Aykroyd&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCller%20%28company%29\"&gt;M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt; commercial in 2011 titled \"W\u00fcnderful Stuff\", &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20MacLeod%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Lewis MacLeod&lt;/a&gt; performed the voice of Yogi.\nIn the animated &lt;a href=\"stop%20motion\"&gt;stop motion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sketch%20comedy\"&gt;sketch comedy&lt;/a&gt; show \"&lt;a href=\"Robot%20Chicken\"&gt;Robot Chicken&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Milano\"&gt;Dan Milano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seth%20Green\"&gt;Seth Green&lt;/a&gt; (creator of the show) voiced Yogi Bear.\n&lt;a href=\"Scott%20Innes\"&gt;Scott Innes&lt;/a&gt; performed the voice of Yogi, along with Boo-Boo, in \"At Picnic\", \"Forest\", and \"Honey Lesson\".\nMedia.\nLive action/animated feature film.\nA live-action/&lt;a href=\"computer-animated\"&gt;computer-animated&lt;/a&gt; film titled \"&lt;a href=\"Yogi%20Bear%20%28film%29\"&gt;Yogi Bear&lt;/a&gt;\" was released by &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Brothers%20Pictures\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; in December 2010.
