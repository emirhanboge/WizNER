The ship was placed in in 1919 and ultimately sold in 1942.\nDesign and description.\nThe \"Hildur\"-class monitors were designed by Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly, from a proposal by &lt;a href=\"John%20Ericsson\"&gt;John Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, for the defense of Lake &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A4laren\"&gt;M\u00e4laren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20archipelago\"&gt;Stockholm archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. They had fixed turrets mounting guns and someone on the defense staff realized that they could be destroyed while retreating because none of the ships could fire to their rear. \"Folke\" was designed to protect her sisters in that situation as her turret was fixed to the rear.\n\"Folke\" was &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of .

Their engines were powered by two cylindrical &lt;a href=\"boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29\"&gt;boilers&lt;/a&gt;. The engines produced a total of which gave the monitors a maximum speed of . The ships carried of coal.\nArmament.\n\"Folke\" was equipped with one M/69 &lt;a href=\"rifled%20breech%20loader\"&gt;rifled breech loader&lt;/a&gt;, mounted in a long, fixed, oval-shaped turret that faced to the rear. The gun weighed and fired projectiles at a &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20velocity\"&gt;muzzle velocity&lt;/a&gt; of . At its maximum elevation of 7.5\u00b0 it had a range of . The ship also mounted two guns.\n\"Folke\" was rearmed with a &lt;a href=\"quick-firing%20gun\"&gt;quick-firing gun&lt;/a&gt; as well as three quick-firing guns sometime in the 1890s or the early 1900s.\nArmor.\n\"Folke\" had a complete waterline armor &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;belt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"wrought%20iron\"&gt;wrought iron&lt;/a&gt; that ranged thick from front to rear. The &lt;a href=\"Deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; was thick. The face of the &lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt; was protected by of armor, while its sides were thick. The &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; protruded from the top of the turret and was protected by of armor.\nConstruction and service.\n\"Folke\" was launched in 1875 by &lt;a href=\"Motala%20Verkstad\"&gt;Motala Verkstad&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Norrk%C3%B6ping\"&gt;Norrk\u00f6ping&lt;/a&gt;. She was decommissioned in 1919 and was eventually converted into a heating plant for submarines. The ship was sold in 1942 for conversion to a &lt;a href=\"barge\"&gt;barge&lt;/a&gt;."
