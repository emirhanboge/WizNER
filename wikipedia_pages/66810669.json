    "text": "Erich Adolf Max Abraham Collin (August 26, 1899 in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 April 28, 1961 in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;) was a German-American &lt;a href=\"Singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; and the 2nd &lt;a href=\"Tenor\"&gt;Tenor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Choir\"&gt;vocal ensemble&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Comedian%20Harmonists\"&gt;Comedian Harmonists&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nErich A. Collin came from a &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; family, but was a baptized &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt;, as were his mother and siblings. His father was the Berlin &lt;a href=\"Pediatrics\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Paul Abraham. His parents divorced in 1904, and his mother from then on used her maiden name, Collin. His singing talent was discovered at an early age, so he received &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt; and singing lessons.\nAfter graduating high school, he was drafted into the German military in 1918, shortly before the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. After his discharge from the army following basic training, he started &lt;a href=\"Medical%20school\"&gt;Medical school&lt;/a&gt; at his father's insistence, but dropped out after the seventh &lt;a href=\"Academic%20term\"&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt;. Again due to parental pressure, he began an &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt; in a bank, which he also quit after his father's death. Eventually, he took up studies at the \"&lt;a href=\"Berlin%20University%20of%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Musikhochschule&lt;/a&gt;\" in Berlin in 1924. There he met Erwin Bootz, who brought him to the &lt;a href=\"Comedian%20Harmonists\"&gt;Comedian Harmonists&lt;/a&gt; in 1929, where he replaced Willi Steiner as second Tenor.\nIn 1931, Collin married the German-French Fernande Holzamer with whom he had one daughter.\nIn 1935, the three Jewish members of the Comedian Harmonists were banned from performing in Germany, whereupon the group split up and Collin and his two Jewish colleagues &lt;a href=\"Emigration\"&gt;emigrated&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; with their wives. There they formed a new ensemble, the so-called Emigrant or Viennese Group, which from 1937 onwards mostly used the name \"Comedy Harmonists\". During their extensive tours of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, Collins' wife and daughter stayed with relatives in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. His sister Annemarie managed to escape Germany to Australia, where the Harmonists hoped to settle, despite concerns about possible &lt;a href=\"Detention%20%28imprisonment%29\"&gt;detention&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Enemy%20alien\"&gt;Enemy alien&lt;/a&gt;s after the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. This plan fell through, however, when the group was unable to return to Australia from a North American tour in 1940 due to the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20warfare\"&gt;naval war&lt;/a&gt; which put a stop to civilian overseas travel.\nWhen the \"Comedy Harmonists\" disbanded in 1941, Collin went to Los Angeles and initially worked in the wine shop of a relative of his colleague Roman Cycowski. Through the help of &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a friend of the Collin-Abraham family in Berlin, he obtained a temporary position as a &lt;a href=\"lecturer\"&gt;lecturer&lt;/a&gt; at a New York university on the subject of old German music. Subsequently, work as a sales representative alternated with periods of &lt;a href=\"unemployment\"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1947, his wife Fernande and daughter Suzanne, who had survived the war in &lt;a href=\"German%20military%20administration%20in%20occupied%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;occupied France&lt;/a&gt;, were able to enter the United States.\nIn the fall of the same year, Erich Collin made a successful attempt at creating a new vocal group. Involved in this U.S. version of the Comedian Harmonists were Jack Cathcart (piano), Fred Bixler (first tenor), Murray Pollack (second tenor), &lt;a href=\"Nicolai%20Shutorev\"&gt;Nicolai Shutorev&lt;/a&gt; (buffo) and Arthur Atkins (bass). The group toured extensively throughout &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benelux\"&gt;Benelux&lt;/a&gt; countries, France, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the tour, Shutorev died unexpectedly of gastric rupture, after which the group completed their concerts in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; without him. One concert from &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; was recorded for Norwegian &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 1948, and broadcast several times. From that concert on, Harry Frommermann (now Harry Frohman) completed the ensemble at the request of Erich Collin. In November 1948 the group was again heard in a radio broadcast, this time from &lt;a href=\"Lugano\"&gt;Lugano&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1949, the group made three records in &lt;a href=\"Basel\"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt; for the label Le Chant du Monde. Unfortunately, the extremely promising project failed due to differing opinions about the future direction of the group.\nIn 1949, Collin became a &lt;a href=\"Citizenship\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. In the 1950s, he worked for &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20Corporation\"&gt;Northrop&lt;/a&gt; and ran a small plastics workshop as a side business. As a victim of Nazi race policies, he began receiving &lt;a href=\"Financial%20compensation\"&gt;compensation payments&lt;/a&gt; from the German &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1950s.\nOn April 28, 1961, he died of &lt;a href=\"heart%20failure\"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; during an &lt;a href=\"appendectomy\"&gt;appendectomy&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 61. For the &lt;a href=\"documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary film&lt;/a&gt; about the Comedian Harmonists by Eberhard Fechner, released in 1976, Collins' sister Annemarie and his wife Fernande were interviewed, providing information about his life and family history. In &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Vilsmaier\"&gt;Joseph Vilsmaier&lt;/a&gt;'s feature film &lt;a href=\"Comedian%20Harmonists%20%28film%29\"&gt;Comedian Harmonists&lt;/a&gt;, Collin was portrayed by German actor Heinrich Schafmeister.\nHis grave is located in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Forever%20Cemetery\"&gt;Hollywood Forever Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nErich Collin married Fernande Holzamer (1909-1995) in 1931. They had one daughter (Eva Suzanne, 1932-1994).\nHis father, Dr. Paul Abraham, was a renowned &lt;a href=\"Pediatrics\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; who ran a recreation home for children from the poor quarters of Berlin."
