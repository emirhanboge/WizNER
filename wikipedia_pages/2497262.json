    "text": "Asocia\u021bia Clubul Sportiv Campionii Fotbal Club Arge\u0219, commonly known as FC Arge\u0219 or Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti (), is a Romanian professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28organization%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arge%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Arge\u0219 County&lt;/a&gt;, which competes in the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Liga I&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team was originally founded as \"Dinamo Pite\u0219ti\" in 1953, and made its debut in the Romanian first division in &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;. In 1967, it was renamed Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti. The most successful period of \"the White-Violets\" came in the &lt;a href=\"1970s\"&gt;1970s&lt;/a&gt;, when they twice won the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt;. Three-time &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year%20%28Gazeta%20Sporturilor%29\"&gt;Romanian Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award recipient &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; was part of the squad during that period, which turned him into a symbol of the club over the years.\nFC Arge\u0219 has amassed over 40 seasons in the first league, and traditionally plays its home matches at the &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which has a capacity of 15,000 seats.\nHistory.\nFounding and early years (1953\u20131967).\nOn August 6, 1953, an order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs settled the birthday of \"Dinamo Pite\u0219ti\", the current formation FC Arge\u0219, the name being taken after the older sister from &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. The new team from &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; started its rise from the bottom, Campionatul Or\u0103\u0219enesc, today &lt;a href=\"Liga%20IV\"&gt;Liga IV&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Liga%20V\"&gt;Liga V&lt;/a&gt;, but the involvement of the local administration in bringing the best football players from the city to FC Arge\u0219 will be the main factor in the consecutive promotions of the club. The promotion to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt; has occurred at the end of the 1958\u20131959 &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Divizia C&lt;/a&gt; season, and in the first year was very close to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; promotion, but Dinamo occupied only the second place of the second series of &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt;. The dream took shape for the football fans from &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; in the next season. In 1961 Dinamo Pite\u0219ti promoted on the first &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football stage under the command of coaches \u015etefan Vasile and T\u0103nase Dima. Three of the most well-known members of the squad were &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Barbu%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201938%29\"&gt;Ion Barbu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Halagian\"&gt;Florin Halagian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;, the players who contributed the most at Dinamo's performance. &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1961\u201362 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; season was a tough one for the club which accused the shock of the debut and relegated back to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt; after only one year in the first league.\nAfter only one season in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Divizia B&lt;/a&gt;, Dinamo Pite\u0219ti promoted again in 1963, remaining then a constant presence on the first stage of the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football, 10th place in &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;, but a season in which the team achieved &lt;a href=\"Cupa%20Rom%C3%A2niei\"&gt;Romanian Cup&lt;/a&gt; final, 8th in &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, 4th in &lt;a href=\"1965%E2%80%9366%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt; and 12th in &lt;a href=\"1966%E2%80%9367%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt;.\nGolden era (1967\u20131983).\nIn the summer of 1967 the club changed its name from \"Dinamo Pite\u0219ti\" to FC Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti, a name that wrote history, remaining forever in the history of the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football and in the remembering of the fans.\nThe first season with the new name was a great one for FC Arge\u0219, which finished 2nd, with the same number of points as &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, the champions of that season. The best ranking in club's history until then was followed only by a 12th place in &lt;a href=\"1968%E2%80%9369%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;, a 10th place in &lt;a href=\"1969%E2%80%9370%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; and a 9th place in &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen in the &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1971\u201372 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; season nothing announced the great final success of \"the White-Violets\". In the first round the team had a bad debut, with a defeat (1\u20134) at &lt;a href=\"FCM%20Bac%C4%83u\"&gt;SC Bac\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and the tension within the team led to the dismissal of coach &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Ozon\"&gt;Titus Ozon&lt;/a&gt;, in his place was promoted a young coach, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Halagian\"&gt;Florin Halagian&lt;/a&gt;, a former player of Dinamo Pite\u0219ti. At his debut on August 29, 1971, being the youngest coach of &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt;, FC Arge\u0219 won 2\u20131 against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, both goals scored by &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Jercan\"&gt;Jercan&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the first part of the championship, FC Arge\u015f was on the 4th place, with 18 points, following the teams: &lt;a href=\"FC%20UTA%20Arad\"&gt;UTA Arad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FCM%20Bac%C4%83u\"&gt;SC Bac\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Universitatea%20Cluj\"&gt;Universitatea Cluj&lt;/a&gt;. The winter preparations took place at &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83ile%20Herculane\"&gt;B\u0103ile Herculane&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a strong tournament in the former &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, tournament that would help the team a lot in the second part of the championship. The second part was extraordinary, FC Arge\u0219 being defeated only twice (0\u20132, at home against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bra%C8%99ov%20%281936%29\"&gt;Steagul Ro\u0219u Bra\u0219ov&lt;/a&gt; and 0\u20131, at &lt;a href=\"Cluj-Napoca\"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt;, against &lt;a href=\"CFR%20Cluj\"&gt;CFR&lt;/a&gt;). There were followed by 9 games without defeats, in which &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Halagian\"&gt;Halagian&lt;/a&gt; played the big card several times. Thus, in the match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Ia%C8%99i%20%281945%29\"&gt;Politehnica Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;, he played in each half with a different line of midfielders, to everyone's surprise, to force the victory and to have fresh players until the end. In the penultimate stage (21 June 1972), at &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, FC Arge\u0219 defeated &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bihor%20Oradea\"&gt;Cri\u015ful Oradea&lt;/a&gt;, becoming champion of &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in its history, with one round before the end of the championship. The team played very offensive and ambitious, with an inspired &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; at the helm. The score was 4\u20131 (3\u20131) for \"the White-Violets\", through the goals scored by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; (min 25 and 43), &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Prepurgel\"&gt;Prepurgel&lt;/a&gt; (min 28), &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Radu%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;M. Joita&lt;/a&gt; (min 83) and T\u0103ma\u015f for Cri\u0219ul). In front of over 17,000 spectators, in the final round, although he had the title in his pocket, FC Arge\u0219 defeated &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Na%C8%9Bional%20%281953%29\"&gt;23 August Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, with the score of 3\u20132, through the goals scored by: &lt;a href=\"Radu%20Jercan\"&gt;Jercan&lt;/a&gt; (min 45), &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Radu%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;C. Radu I&lt;/a&gt; (min 55), &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Fr%C4%83%C8%9Bil%C4%83\"&gt;Fr\u0103\u021bil\u0103&lt;/a&gt; (min 89), respectively &lt;a href=\"Mircea%20Lucescu\"&gt;Lucescu&lt;/a&gt; (min 17) and &lt;a href=\"Florea%20Dumitrache\"&gt;Dumitrache&lt;/a&gt; (min 61) for Dinamo.\nFollowing their 1972 &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; title, FC Arge\u0219 played in &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Champion Clubs Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the first round, the team from &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; eliminated without big problems, 6\u20130 on aggregate, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Aris%20Bonnevoie\"&gt;Aris Bonnevoie&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, but then in the second round fate have brought them in their way &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, a team with 6 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Champion Clubs Cup&lt;/a&gt;s at that moment and with big players like: &lt;a href=\"Pirri\"&gt;Pirri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ignacio%20Zoco\"&gt;Ignacio Zoco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santillana%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Santillana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amancio%20Amaro\"&gt;Amancio&lt;/a&gt;, the coach was legendary &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;Miguel Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt; and president was &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Yeste\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u&lt;/a&gt; himself. The match seemed to be a formality for &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; but on the pitch FC Arge\u0219 made probably the best match in its entire history, a match in which a legend would be born, &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; played absolutely fantastic wooing the audience and opponents, he scored for 1\u20130 in 24 minutes then Anzarda scored for 1\u20131 in 41 minutes. Prepurgel scored then for 2\u20131 in 62 minutes, goal followed by a multitude of occasions at the goal of the inspired &lt;a href=\"Mariano%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Rem%C3%B3n\"&gt;Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Yeste\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u&lt;/a&gt; amazed by &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;'s technics offered 2 million dollars and a floodlight facility for him, but &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt; refused, considering &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; a national treasure.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real&lt;/a&gt; qualified hard after a goal scored in 87 minutes. The final score was 3\u20131, &lt;a href=\"Santillana%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Santillana&lt;/a&gt; (17', 87') and Grande (47') scored for Real, &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Radu\"&gt;Radu II&lt;/a&gt; (43') for FC Arge\u0219.\nThe following seasons were oscillating for the team which finished 3rd in &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, 8th in &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;, 7th in &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt; getting even to the 11th place in &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen in the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1977\u201378 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; season FC Arge\u0219 had a remarkable comeback like the last time and finished 2nd, again at the same number of points with the leaders, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, as in 1968.\n&lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1978\u201379 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; season started under the sign of a good training and a desire to fructify the growing maturity of a group of young players, most of them raised in &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of the same coach, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20Halagian\"&gt;Florin Halagian&lt;/a&gt;, helped by Leonte lanovschi and &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20O%C5%A3et\"&gt;Constantin O\u0163et&lt;/a&gt;, transferred with a few days before the start of the championship. The goal of the club's leadership was to occupy one of the 1 to 5 places and to accumulate at least 18 points in the championship first part. FC Arge\u015f started the championship in force, winning two games against &lt;a href=\"Chimia%20R%C3%A2mnicu%20V%C3%A2lcea\"&gt;Chimia R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Politehnica%20Ia%C8%99i%20%281945%29\"&gt;Politehnica Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt; and ended up in the lead places. It was only in the 6th round when the club recorded the first defeat, 0\u20131, at &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A2rgu%20Mure%C8%99\"&gt;T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219&lt;/a&gt;, against &lt;a href=\"ASA%20T%C3%A2rgu%20Mure%C8%99%20%281962%29\"&gt;ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219&lt;/a&gt;. The players were the subject of double efforts, most of them being part of the Romanian Olympic team, which managed, after many years, to defeat the Hungarian team at &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the first part of the championship, FC Arge\u015f was on the first position in the standings. A new player started successfully at &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Moiceanu\"&gt;Moiceanu&lt;/a&gt;, who soon became a secret weapon for the teammates and opponents. In the last round of the first part, FC Arge\u0219 won the match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; (score 1\u20130) and became the champion of the first part with 10 matches won, a draw and 6 defeats, 25 goals scored and 17 received, totalizing 21 points, three more than the number proposed at the start of the championship.\nThe well-known sports journalist Lauren\u021biu Dumitrescu wrote in \"Sportul\" newspaper, \"... it was also in the autumn of 78 Dobrin's team, the team of that great talented player, who has been playing for more than 15 years with the 10 number shirt, the capable player \u2013 even at 31 years old \u2013 to decide any match in our championship (examples of testimonies: the matches against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Baia%20Mare\"&gt;FC Baia Mare&lt;/a&gt;, on their own ground, and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Steaua&lt;/a&gt;, away) to score goals of great spectacularity. When &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; was absent, intervened &lt;a href=\"Sevastian%20Iov%C4%83nescu\"&gt;Iov\u0103nescu&lt;/a&gt;, an offensive midfielder who had an exceptional season, perhaps the best of his career, and he also took the role of puncher when the striker, &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Radu\"&gt;Radu II&lt;/a&gt;, was injured. But was also &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Stancu\"&gt;Stancu's&lt;/a&gt; part of championship, who became at only 22 years old, the mature leader of the defense, defense which combines the experience of &lt;a href=\"Petre%20Ivan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29\"&gt;Ivan II&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20C%C3%A2rstea\"&gt;C\u00e2rstea&lt;/a&gt;'s strength and the ambition of &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Zamfir%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Mihai Zamfir&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOn June 24, 1979, in front of 20,000 spectators, on the &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Dinamo\"&gt;Dinamo Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, FC Arge\u0219 defeated Dinamo, after a high-tension match, with the score 4\u20133, through the goals scored by: &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Radu\"&gt;Radu II&lt;/a&gt; (min 11 and 24), &lt;a href=\"Doru%20Nicolae\"&gt;Doru Nicolae&lt;/a&gt; (min 69) and &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; (min 90) respectively &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Dragnea\"&gt;Dragnea&lt;/a&gt; (min 6) and &lt;a href=\"Dudu%20Georgescu\"&gt;Dudu Georgescu&lt;/a&gt; (min 76, from penalty, and min 89) and won the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n title for the second time in its history.\nAfter the game in \"Sportul\" newspaper, the well-known sports journalist &lt;a href=\"Ioan%20Chiril%C4%83\"&gt;Ioan Chiril\u0103&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"The championship final, expected with an extraordinary interest, which massively diminished the number of spectators on all the other grounds, ended with the deserved victory of the Pite\u0219ti people after a high-tension game, in which the thirst for victory of Dinamo's players and supporters received a veto from &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;, who offered to the audience and the viewers I do not know what number's game of his life, being the player who dominated the field from all points of view.\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1978\u201379 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; FC Arge\u0219 eliminated &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.\"&gt;Panathinaikos&lt;/a&gt; and gave up hard in front of &lt;a href=\"Valencia%20CF\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;, 4\u20136 on aggregate.\nThan the club finished on the podium for 2 times, in &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1980%E2%80%9381%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt; and only on 10th place &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;.

In the summer of 1983 Dobrin comeback to his big love, FC Arge\u0219, but played only 5 matches and retired on 14 June 1983, in a match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bihor%20Oradea\"&gt;Bihor Oradea&lt;/a&gt;, the team finishing in 5th place.\nAfter Nicolae Dobrin (1983\u20132009).\nThe retirement of &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;, the emblematic symbol of FC Arge\u0219, it also meant the end of the great performance for the club. In the 80's the team become a middle of the leaderboard team, finishing frequently on 6th, 7th or 9th place, but managed however to reach 3 &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals in this period. Than at the end of the 80's and beginning of the 90's the team slipped even in the lower half everything cumulating with the relegation from &lt;a href=\"Liga%20I\"&gt;Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; after 29 years spent in the top-flight of the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football.\nRelegated in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt; and with financial problems FC Arge\u0219 was taken over by &lt;a href=\"Automobile%20Dacia\"&gt;Dacia&lt;/a&gt;, whose director was Constantin Stroe, who paid the debts. The club promoted back in 1994, finished 8th in &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; and was again at 5 points away from relegation in &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. Than in the next season the team comeback in the middle of the table.\n&lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1997\u201398 Divizia A&lt;/a&gt; season was the last peak of FC Arge\u0219's history. The team finished 3rd and qualified for &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1998\u201399 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; where they eliminated teams like &lt;a href=\"FC%20Baku\"&gt;Dynamo Baku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0stanbulspor%20A.%C5%9E.\"&gt;\u0130stanbulspor&lt;/a&gt; but were eliminated without problems by &lt;a href=\"Celta%20de%20Vigo\"&gt;Celta de Vigo&lt;/a&gt; 0\u20138 on aggregate. This last presence in European Cups it was due to a formidable generation, the second most talented after the &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;'s generation. This FC Arge\u0219 team had players like: &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Mutu\"&gt;Adrian Mutu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Vintil%C4%83\"&gt;Bogdan Vintil\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20N%C4%83stase\"&gt;Valentin N\u0103stase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iulian%20Crivac\"&gt;Iulian Crivac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Schumacher\"&gt;Constantin Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Barbu\"&gt;Constantin Barbu&lt;/a&gt;.\nFC Arge\u0219 continued its good seasons finishing 4th in &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, than on 5th place in &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. Than from &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Divizia%20A\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; the team was a constant presence in the second half of the leaderboard, finishing in the best case on 10th place. This bad period ended with the second relegation in the club's history, this time after 13 years, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Liga%20I\"&gt;2006\u201307 Liga I&lt;/a&gt; season.\nThe team promoted back after only one season in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Romanian \"Calciopoli\"\" and Bankruptcy (2009\u20132013).\n\"The White-Violet Eagles\" finished 8th at their first season after the promotion, a season with good results and a solid style of playing. Than on June 8, 2009 a news would shock the world of the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n football, FC Arge\u0219 was relegated in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;, after National Anti-corruption Division, found that the owner of the team from that period, Cornel Penescu, tried to bribe more referees to \"help\" the team winning. This case was named by the press \"Penescu Case\" or the \"Romanian \"&lt;a href=\"2006%20Italian%20football%20scandal\"&gt;Calciopoli&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nAfter Cornel Penescu's arrest, his son, Andrei Penescu led the club, but the funding was practically non-existent and the club struggled to survive even in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in the second half of the table. Then on July 26, 2013 it was announced that FC Arge\u0219 is &lt;a href=\"Bankruptcy\"&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; without any chance of rescue.\nSCM Pite\u0219ti and supporters' club (2013\u20132017).\nAfter the bankruptcy of FC Arge\u0219, people of &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; have tried to bring football back to life.\nThe first project was &lt;a href=\"SCM%20Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;SCM Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, a project initiated by Pite\u0219ti Municipality which created a football section at SCM, the Sporting Club of the Municipality, in 2011, with 2 years before the end of FC Arge\u0219, anticipating the bankruptcy of the club led at that time by Penescu's son, a club full of debts and with no future. The team promoted at &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Liga III&lt;/a&gt; after only one season and remained at that level until 2017 when they promoted to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;Liga II&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe supporters of FC Arge\u0219 encouraged the team until the very end, then after the bankruptcy they founded &lt;a href=\"FC%20Arge%C8%99%201953%20Pite%C5%9Fti\"&gt;FC Arge\u0219 1953 Pite\u015fti&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20club%20%28sports%29\"&gt;phoenix club&lt;/a&gt; fully owned by FC Arge\u0219 supporters. The club won &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Liga%20IV\"&gt;2015\u201316 Liga IV&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Arge%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Arge\u0219 County&lt;/a&gt; and than the promotion play-off match against Recolta Stoic\u0103ne\u0219ti, &lt;a href=\"Olt%20County\"&gt;Olt County&lt;/a&gt; champion, with the score of 5\u20132, but they couldn't join &lt;a href=\"Liga%20III\"&gt;Liga III&lt;/a&gt; due to lack of funds and then dissolved the senior team.\nThen Pite\u0219ti Municipality has shown the intention to buy FC Arge\u0219's brand and the fans have also announced that they support this initiative.\nRebirth and return to Liga I (2017\u2013present).\nOn 16 June 2017, the Municipality of Pite\u0219ti bought FC Arge\u0219's brand for 550,000 &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20leu\"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this association, the brand was transferred to SCM Pite\u0219ti's football section, newly promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20II\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt;, and the team came back to life four years after it was declared bankrupt. After promotion, the team spent 3 years in the second league. FC Arge\u0219 managed to earn promotion to the first division at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Liga%20II\"&gt;2019\u201320 season&lt;/a&gt;, after an 11-year break. Pite\u0219ti narrowly earned a 2nd place, after &lt;a href=\"FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti\"&gt;Rapid&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href=\"Turris-Oltul%20Turnu%20M%C4%83gurele\"&gt;Turris-Oltul Turnu M\u0103gurele&lt;/a&gt; to a draw in the seventh minute of extra time, a score at which Teleorman remained in the second league, and FC Arge\u0219 promoted directly.\nIn the first half of their &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Liga%20I\"&gt;comeback season&lt;/a&gt;, FC Arge\u0219 failed to impress, their winless streak leaving them last place in the league at the beginning of 2021. Things began to change after former player &lt;a href=\"Andrei%20Prepeli%C8%9B%C4%83\"&gt;Andrei Prepeli\u021b\u0103&lt;/a&gt; took over as manager, the team recording a 11 unbeaten league games run, and slowly crawling out of the relegation places to join the fight for a play-off place. With their unbeaten streak cut short by a 0\u20135 defeat against reigning champions &lt;a href=\"CFR%20Cluj\"&gt;CFR Cluj&lt;/a&gt;, FC Arge\u0219 kept their momentum, but never made it above 7th place. They missed a chance to make it through with a 1\u20131 draw against fellow play-off contenders &lt;a href=\"FC%20Academica%20Clinceni\"&gt;Academica Clinceni&lt;/a&gt; and by the penultimate round, they missed the play-off qualification altogether following a 1\u20134 loss against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Hermannstadt\"&gt;Hermannstadt&lt;/a&gt;.\nYouth program.\nYouth academy of FC Arge\u0219 gave important names for Romanian and international football like: &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Mutu\"&gt;Adrian Mutu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ilie%20B%C4%83rbulescu%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ilie B\u0103rbulescu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Bila%C8%99co\"&gt;Marius Bila\u0219co&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20C%C3%A2rstea\"&gt;Constantin C\u00e2rstea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%C4%83nu%C8%9B%20Coman\"&gt;D\u0103nu\u021b Coman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iulian%20Crivac\"&gt;Iulian Crivac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Dic%C4%83\"&gt;Emil Dic\u0103&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valentin%20N%C4%83stase\"&gt;Valentin N\u0103stase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Neaga\"&gt;Adrian Neaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Radu\"&gt;Marin Radu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Stancu\"&gt;Bogdan Stancu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cristian%20T%C4%83nase\"&gt;Cristian T\u0103nase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Stancu\"&gt;Constantin Stancu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%20Vintil%C4%83\"&gt;Bogdan Vintil\u0103&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Vl%C4%83doiu\"&gt;Ion Vl\u0103doiu&lt;/a&gt;.\nStadium.\nThe club played its home matches on &lt;a href=\"Stadionul%20Nicolae%20Dobrin\"&gt;Stadionul Nicolae Dobrin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pite%C8%99ti\"&gt;Pite\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt;, a stadium with a capacity of 15,000 seats, the biggest of &lt;a href=\"Arge%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Arge\u0219 County&lt;/a&gt;.\nSupport.\nFC Arge\u0219 has many supporters in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and especially in &lt;a href=\"Arge%C8%99%20County\"&gt;Arge\u0219 County&lt;/a&gt;.
