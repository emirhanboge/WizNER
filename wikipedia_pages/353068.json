    "text": "Barrow-in-Furness is a &lt;a href=\"port%20town\"&gt;port town&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borough%20of%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;borough of the same name&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;, North-West England. &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt; part of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, it was incorporated as a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20borough\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt; in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Borough of Barrow-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt;. At the tip of the &lt;a href=\"Furness\"&gt;Furness peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, close to the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;, it is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20Bay\"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Duddon%20Estuary\"&gt;Duddon Estuary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, Barrow's population was 56,745, making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt;. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as &lt;a href=\"Barrovian\"&gt;Barrovian&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow was a small &lt;a href=\"hamlet%20%28place%29\"&gt;hamlet&lt;/a&gt; within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Abbey\"&gt;Furness Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, now on the outskirts of the modern-day town, controlling the local economy before its &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries\"&gt;dissolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1537. The iron prospector &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Schneider\"&gt;Henry Schneider&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Railway\"&gt;Furness Railway&lt;/a&gt; in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further &lt;a href=\"hematite\"&gt;hematite&lt;/a&gt; deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period of the late 19th century, the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Hematite%20Steel%20Company\"&gt;Barrow Hematite Steel Company&lt;/a&gt;-owned steelworks was the world's largest.\nBarrow's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and the local yard's specialisation in submarines. The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering\"&gt;Vickers&lt;/a&gt; shipyard as Barrow's main industry and employer. Several &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy%20Fleet%20Flagship\"&gt;flagships&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of its &lt;a href=\"Nuclear%20submarine%23Royal%20Navy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;nuclear submarines&lt;/a&gt; as well as numerous other naval vessels, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20liner\"&gt;ocean liner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;s have been manufactured at the facility.\nThe end of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"peace%20dividend\"&gt;decrease in military spending&lt;/a&gt; saw high unemployment in the town through lack of contracts; despite this, the &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; shipyard remains operational as the UK's largest by workforce (9,500 employees in 2020) and is now undergoing a major expansion associated with the submarine programme. Today Barrow is also a hub for energy generation and handling. Offshore wind farms form one of the highest concentrations of turbines in the world, including &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;the second largest offshore farm&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple operating bases in Barrow.\nToponymy.\nThe name was originally that of an island, Barrai, which can be traced back to 1190. This was later renamed Old Barrow, recorded as Oldebarrey in 1537, and Old Barrow Insula and Barrohead in 1577. The island was then joined to the mainland and the town took its name. The name itself seems to mean \"island with promontory\", combining British \"barro-\" and Old Norse \"ey\", but it is more likely that &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;n settlers simply accepted \"barro-\" as a meaningless name, and so added an explanatory &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; second element.\nNicknames.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barrow was nicknamed \"the English Chicago\" because of the sudden and rapid growth in its industry, economic stature and overall size. More recently the town has been dubbed the \"capital of &lt;a href=\"Blue-collar%20worker\"&gt;blue-collar&lt;/a&gt; Britain\" by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\", reflecting its strong working class identity. Barrow is also often jokingly referred to as being at the end of the longest &lt;a href=\"cul-de-sac\"&gt;cul-de-sac&lt;/a&gt; in the country because of its isolated location at the tip of the Furness peninsula.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBarrow and the surrounding area has been settled non-continuously for several millennia with evidence of &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants on &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a rich history of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; settlement across Cumbria and the discovery of related artefacts in the Barrow area, no buildings or structures have been found to support the idea of a functioning Roman community on the &lt;a href=\"Furness\"&gt;Furness&lt;/a&gt; peninsula. The &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Hoard\"&gt;Furness Hoard&lt;/a&gt; discovery of &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; silver coins and other artefacts in 2011 provided significant archaeological evidence of &lt;a href=\"Norse%20activity%20in%20the%20British%20Isles\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt; settlement in the early 9th century. Several areas of Barrow including &lt;a href=\"Yarlside\"&gt;Yarlside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ormsgill\"&gt;Ormsgill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as \"Barrow\" and \"Furness\", have names of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; origin. The &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; of 1086 recorded the settlements of Hietun, Rosse and Hougenai, which are now the districts of &lt;a href=\"Hawcoat\"&gt;Hawcoat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roose\"&gt;Roose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; the Furness peninsula was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Cistercian\"&gt;Cistercian&lt;/a&gt; monks of the Abbey of St Mary of Furness, known as &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Abbey\"&gt;Furness Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. This was in the \"Vale of Nightshade\", now on the outskirts of the town. Founded for the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20of%20Savigny\"&gt;Savigniac order&lt;/a&gt;, it was built on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20of%20England\"&gt;King Stephen&lt;/a&gt; in 1123. Soon after the abbey's foundation the monks discovered iron ore deposits, later to provide the basis for the Furness economy. These thin strata, close to the surface, were extracted through open cut workings, which were then smelted by the monks. The proceeds from mining, along with agriculture and fisheries, meant that by the 15th century the abbey had become the second richest and most powerful Cistercian abbey in England, after &lt;a href=\"Fountains%20Abbey\"&gt;Fountains Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in Yorkshire. The monks of Furness Abbey constructed a wooden tower on nearby &lt;a href=\"Piel%20Island\"&gt;Piel Island&lt;/a&gt; in 1212 which acted as their main trading point; it was twice invaded by the Scots, in 1316 and 1322. In 1327 &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;King Edward III&lt;/a&gt; gave Furness Abbey a licence to &lt;a href=\"crenellate\"&gt;crenellate&lt;/a&gt; the tower, and a &lt;a href=\"motte-and-bailey%20castle\"&gt;motte-and-bailey castle&lt;/a&gt; was built. However Barrow itself was just a hamlet in the parish of &lt;a href=\"Dalton-in-Furness\"&gt;Dalton-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt;, reliant on the land and sea for survival. Small quantities of iron and ore were exported from jetties on the channel separating the village from Walney Island. Amongst the oldest buildings in Barrow are several cottages and farmhouses in &lt;a href=\"Newbarns\"&gt;Newbarns&lt;/a&gt; (now a ward of the borough) which date back to the early 17th century; as well as &lt;a href=\"Rampside%20Hall\"&gt;Rampside Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Grade%20I%20listed\"&gt;Grade I listed&lt;/a&gt; building and the best-preserved in the town from the 1600s. Even as late as 1843 there were still only 32 dwellings, including two pubs.\n19th century.\nIn 1839 &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Schneider\"&gt;Henry Schneider&lt;/a&gt; arrived as a young speculator and dealer in iron, and he discovered large deposits of &lt;a href=\"haematite\"&gt;haematite&lt;/a&gt; in 1850. He and other investors founded the &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Railway\"&gt;Furness Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the first section of which opened in 1846, to transport the ore from the slate quarries at &lt;a href=\"Kirkby-in-Furness\"&gt;Kirkby-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; and haematite mines at &lt;a href=\"Lindal-in-Furness\"&gt;Lindal-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Askam%20and%20Ireleth\"&gt;Askam and Ireleth&lt;/a&gt; to a deep-water harbour near &lt;a href=\"Roa%20Island\"&gt;Roa Island&lt;/a&gt;. The crucial and difficult link across &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20Bay\"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carnforth\"&gt;Carnforth&lt;/a&gt; on the main line was promoted, as the &lt;a href=\"Ulverston%20and%20Lancaster%20Railway\"&gt;Ulverston and Lancaster Railway&lt;/a&gt;, by a group led by &lt;a href=\"John%20Brogden%20%28industrialist%29\"&gt;John Brogden&lt;/a&gt; and opened in 1857. It was promptly purchased by the Furness Railway.\nThe docks built between 1863 and 1881 in the more sheltered channel between the mainland and &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Island%20%28England%29\"&gt;Barrow Island&lt;/a&gt; replaced the port at Roa Island. The first dock to open was &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Dock\"&gt;Devonshire Dock&lt;/a&gt; in 1867, and Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"William%20Ewart%20Gladstone\"&gt;William Ewart Gladstone&lt;/a&gt; stated his belief that \"Barrow would become another Liverpool\". The increasing quantities of iron ore mined in Furness were then brought into the centre of Barrow to be transported by sea.\nThe investors in the burgeoning mining and railway industries decided that greater profits could be made by smelting the iron ore and converting the resultant pig-iron into steel, and then exporting the finished product. Schneider and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20James%20Ramsden\"&gt;James Ramsden&lt;/a&gt;, the railway's general manager, erected &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;s at Barrow that by 1876 formed the largest steelworks in the world. Its success was a result of the availability of local iron ore and coal from the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; mines and easy rail and sea transport. The Furness Railway, which counted local aristocrats &lt;a href=\"William%20Cavendish%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire\"&gt;William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Buccleuch\"&gt;Duke of Buccleuch&lt;/a&gt; as investors, kick-started the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; on the peninsula. The railway brought mined ore to the town, where the steelworks produced large quantities of steel. It was used for shipbuilding, and derived products such as rails were also exported from the newly built docks.\nBarrow's population grew rapidly. Population figures for the town itself were not collected until 1871, though sources suggest that Barrow's population was still as low as 700 in 1851. During the first half of the 19th century, Barrow formed part of the parish of &lt;a href=\"Dalton-in-Furness\"&gt;Dalton-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt;, the population of which shows some of Barrow's early growth from the 1850s:\nPopulation of the Parish of Dalton-in-Furness\nIn 1871 Barrow's population was recorded at 18,584 and in 1881 at 47,259, less than forty years after the railway was built. The majority of migrants originated from elsewhere in Lancashire although significant numbers settled in Barrow from &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, which represented 11% and 7% of the local population in the 1890s. By the turn of the 20th century, the Scottish-born population had increased to form the highest portion anywhere in England. Other notable immigrant groups includes the Cornish whom represented 80% of the district of Roose's population at the time of the 1881 census. In an attempt to diversify Barrow's economy James Ramsden founded the Barrow and Calcutta Jute Company in 1870 and the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Jute%20Works\"&gt;Barrow Jute Works&lt;/a&gt; was soon constructed alongside the Furness Railway line in &lt;a href=\"Hindpool\"&gt;Hindpool&lt;/a&gt;. The mill employed 2,000 women at its peak and was awarded a gold medal for its produce at the 1878 Paris &lt;a href=\"Exposition%20Universelle%20%281878%29\"&gt;Exposition Universelle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sheltered strait between Barrow and Walney Island was an ideal location for the shipyard. The first ship to be built, the \"Jane Roper\", was launched in 1852; the first steamship, a 3,000-ton liner named \"Duke of Devonshire\", in 1873. Shipbuilding activity increased, and on 18 February 1871 the Barrow Shipbuilding Company was incorporated. Barrow's relative isolation from the United Kingdom's industrial heartlands meant that the newly formed company included several capabilities that would usually be subcontracted to other establishments. In particular, a large engineering works was constructed including a foundry and pattern shop, a forge, and an engine shop. In addition, the shipyard had a joiners' shop, a boat-building shed and a sailmaking and rigging loft.\nDuring these boom years, Ramsden proposed building a &lt;a href=\"town%20planning\"&gt;planned town&lt;/a&gt; to accommodate the large workforce which had arrived. There are few planned towns in the United Kingdom, and Barrow is one of the oldest. Its centre contains a grid of well-built terraced houses, with a tree-lined road leading away from a central square. Ramsden later became the first mayor of Barrow, which was given &lt;a href=\"municipal%20borough\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt; status in 1867, and county borough status in 1889. The imposing red sandstone &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, designed by W.H. Lynn, was built in a neo-gothic style in 1887. Prior to this, the borough council had met at the railway headquarters: the railway company's control of industry extended to the administration of the town itself.\nThe Barrow Shipbuilding Company was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; steel firm of &lt;a href=\"Vickers\"&gt;Vickers&lt;/a&gt; in 1897, by which time the shipyard had surpassed the railway and steelworks as the largest employer and landowner in Barrow. The company constructed &lt;a href=\"Vickerstown\"&gt;Vickerstown&lt;/a&gt;, modelled on &lt;a href=\"George%20Cadbury\"&gt;George Cadbury&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bournville\"&gt;Bournville&lt;/a&gt;, on the adjacent Walney Island in the early 20th century to house its employees. It also commissioned &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens\"&gt;Sir Edwin Lutyens&lt;/a&gt; to design &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20House%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Abbey House&lt;/a&gt; as a guest house and residence for its managing director, Commander Craven.\n20th century.\nBy the 1890s the shipyard was heavily engaged in the construction of warships for the Royal Navy and also for export. The Royal Navy's first submarine, \"&lt;a href=\"Holland%201\"&gt;Holland 1&lt;/a&gt;\", was built in 1901, and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"airship%20hangar\"&gt;airship hangar&lt;/a&gt;s during the early 20th century. Originally constructed in a large shed at Cavendish Dock, production later relocated to &lt;a href=\"Barrow/Walney%20Island%20Airport\"&gt;Barrow/Walney Island Airport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"HMA%20No.%201\"&gt;HMA No. 1&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed the Mayfly is the most notable airship to have been built in Barrow. The first of its kind in the UK it came to an untimely end on 24 September 1911 when it was wrecked by wind during trials. Well-known ships built in Barrow include , the Japanese flagship during the 1905 &lt;a href=\"Russo-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Russo-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;, the liner and the aircraft carriers and . It should also be noted that there was a significant presence of Vickers' armament division in Barrow with the huge &lt;a href=\"VSEL%20Heavy%20Engineering%20Workshop\"&gt;Heavy Engineering Workshop&lt;/a&gt; on Michaelson Road supplying ammunition for the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; throughout both world wars. World War 1 brought significant temporary migration as workers arrived to work in the munitions factory and shipyard, with the town's population reaching to an estimated peak of around 82,000 during the War. Thousands of local men fought abroad during World War I, 616 were ultimately killed in action.\nDuring World War II, Barrow was a target for the &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;German air force&lt;/a&gt; looking to disable the town's shipbuilding capabilities (see &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Blitz\"&gt;Barrow Blitz&lt;/a&gt;). The town suffered the most in a short period between April and May 1941. During the war, a local housewife, &lt;a href=\"Nella%20Last\"&gt;Nella Last&lt;/a&gt;, was selected to write a diary of her experiences on the home front for the &lt;a href=\"Mass-Observation\"&gt;Mass-Observation&lt;/a&gt; project. Her memoirs were later adapted for television as \"&lt;a href=\"Housewife%2C%2049\"&gt;Housewife, 49&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Wood\"&gt;Victoria Wood&lt;/a&gt;. The difficulty in targeting bombs meant that the shipyards and steelworks were often missed, at the expense of the residential areas. Ultimately, 83 people were killed and 11,000 houses in the area were left damaged. To escape the heaviest bombardments, many people in the central areas left the town to sleep in hedgerows, with some being permanently evacuated. Barrow's industry continued to supply the war effort, with &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; visiting the town on one occasion to launch the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; . Besides the dozens of civilians killed during World War II, some 268 Barrovian men were also killed whilst in combat.\nBarrow's population reached a second peak in of 77,900 in 1951; however, by this point the long decline of mining and steel-making as a result of overseas competition and dwindling resources had already begun. The Barrow ironworks closed in 1963, three years after the last Furness mine shut. The by then small steelworks followed suit in 1983, leaving Barrow's shipyard as the town's principal industry. From the 1960s onwards it concentrated its efforts in submarine manufacture, and the UK's first nuclear-powered submarine, , was constructed in 1960. , the , and s all followed. The last of these are armed with &lt;a href=\"Trident%20missile\"&gt;Trident II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Submarine-launched%20ballistic%20missile\"&gt;missiles&lt;/a&gt; as part of the British government's &lt;a href=\"Trident%20nuclear%20programme\"&gt;Trident nuclear programme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe end of the Cold War in 1991 marked a reduction in the demand for military ships and submarines, and the town continued its decline. The shipyard's dependency on military contracts at the expense of civilian and commercial engineering and shipbuilding meant it was particularly hard hit as government defence spending was reduced dramatically. As a result, the workforce shrank from 14,500 in 1990 to 5,800 in February 1995, with overall unemployment in the town rising over that period from 4.6% to 10%. The rejection by the &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering\"&gt;VSEL&lt;/a&gt; management of detailed plans for Barrow's industrial renewal in the mid-to-late 1980s remains controversial. This has led to renewed academic attention in recent years to the possibilities of converting military-industrial production in declining shipbuilding areas to the offshore renewable energy sector.\n21st century.\nIn a 2002 &lt;a href=\"2002%20Barrow-in-Furness%20legionellosis%20outbreak\"&gt;outbreak of legionellosis&lt;/a&gt; in the town, 172 people were reported to have caught the disease, of whom seven died. This made it the fourth worst outbreak in the world in terms of number of cases and sixth worst in terms of deaths. The source of the bacteria was later found to be steam from a badly maintained air conditioning unit in the council-run arts centre &lt;a href=\"The%20Forum%20Barrow\"&gt;Forum 28&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the conclusion of the inquest into the seven deaths, the coroner for Furness and South Cumbria criticised the council for its health and safety failings. In 2006, council employee Gillian Beckingham and employer &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Barrow Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; were cleared of seven charges of &lt;a href=\"manslaughter\"&gt;manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;. Beckingham, the council senior architect was fined \u00a315,000 and the authority \u00a3125,000. Following the trials the contractor responsible for maintaining the plant settled a \u00a31.5 million claim by the council for damages. The borough council was the first public body in the country to face corporate manslaughter charges.\n2006 saw the construction of &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Offshore%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Barrow Offshore Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;, which has acted as a catalyst for further investment in offshore &lt;a href=\"renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ormonde%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Ormonde Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Walney Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; followed in 2011, the latter of which became the largest offshore wind farm in the world. The three wind farms are located west of Walney Island and are operated primarily by &lt;a href=\"%C3%98rsted%20%28company%29\"&gt;\u00d8rsted (company)&lt;/a&gt;, contain a total of 162 &lt;a href=\"Wind%20turbine\"&gt;turbines&lt;/a&gt; and have a combined &lt;a href=\"Intermittent%20energy%20source%23Terminology\"&gt;nameplate capacity&lt;/a&gt; of 607\u00a0MW, providing energy for well over half a million homes. &lt;a href=\"West%20of%20Duddon%20Sands%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned in 2014 while Walney was extended in 2018 to again become the world's largest such offshore facility.\nDuring the initial wave of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow had the highest rate of infection of any local authority in the United Kingdom. This was attributed to various socio-economic factors and a high level of testing also seen in the neighbouring authorities of South Lakeland and Lancaster. Rates fluctuated throughout the year and towards the end of 2020 infection rates were amongst the lowest in country.\nGovernance.\nBarrow is the largest town in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Borough of Barrow-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; and the largest settlement in the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Furness\"&gt;Furness&lt;/a&gt;. The borough is the direct inheritor of the municipal and county borough charters given to the town in the late 19th century. Historically it is part of the hundred of &lt;a href=\"Lonsdale%20%28hundred%29\"&gt;Lonsdale&lt;/a&gt; 'north of the sands' in the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county boundaries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. Since the local government reforms enacted in England in 1974 the town has been within the administrative county of &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and became an &lt;a href=\"unparished%20area\"&gt;unparished area&lt;/a&gt;. It still forms a part of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Duchy of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Borough%20Council\"&gt;Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; forms the 'lower' tier of local government under &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria County Council&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Barrow-in-Furness%20Council%20election\"&gt;2011 local election&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; has had overall control of the Borough council, while the Borough elected six Labour and five Conservative Party councillors at the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Cumbria%20County%20Council%20election\"&gt;2017 Cumbria County election&lt;/a&gt;. The town, along with &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;, is unparished and forms the bulk of the wards which make the entire borough's area. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Barrow are elected annually, and hold the roles of chairman and Vice-Chairman of Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council. The borough and former county borough of Barrow-in-Furness have been served by 107 mayors, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Sir%20James%20Ramsden\"&gt;Sir James Ramsden&lt;/a&gt; in 1867 and continuing through to incumbent 2020 mayor Kevin Hamilton.\nThe Barrow-in-Furness &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20Kingdom%20Parliament%20constituencies\"&gt;UK Parliament constituency&lt;/a&gt; first came into existence during the &lt;a href=\"1885%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1885 United Kingdom general election&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"David%20Duncan%20%28UK%20politician%29\"&gt;David Duncan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; becoming the first &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MP) for the town. The seat was won by the Conservative Party in &lt;a href=\"1892%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1892&lt;/a&gt;, before being won for the first time by Labour in &lt;a href=\"1906%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;1906&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent 40 years the seat swung between Conservative and Labour, but since 1945 it has been generally considered a Labour safe seat. In 1983, the constituency was expanded to include several commuter towns such as Dalton-in-Furness and Ulverston and was renamed &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20and%20Furness%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Barrow and Furness&lt;/a&gt;. It was subsequently won by the Conservatives, with the victory attributed to Labour's stance against the nuclear-powered submarines that were being constructed in Barrow. Following a change in Labour policy the party won Barrow and Furness in 1992. &lt;a href=\"John%20Woodcock%20%28UK%20politician%29\"&gt;John Woodcock&lt;/a&gt; was the MP for the constituency between the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2019%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2019 general election&lt;/a&gt;, when Conservative &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Fell%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Simon Fell&lt;/a&gt; succeeded as MP for the Borough.\nGeography.\nBarrow is situated at the tip of the &lt;a href=\"Furness\"&gt;Furness&lt;/a&gt; peninsula on the north-western edge of &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20Bay\"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt;, south of the &lt;a href=\"Duddon%20Estuary\"&gt;Duddon Estuary&lt;/a&gt; and east of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;, surrounds the peninsula's Irish Sea coast and is separated from Barrow by the narrow &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Channel\"&gt;Walney Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Both Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary are characterized by large areas of &lt;a href=\"quicksand\"&gt;quicksand&lt;/a&gt; and fast-moving &lt;a href=\"tidal%20bore\"&gt;tidal bore&lt;/a&gt;s. Areas of &lt;a href=\"sand%20dunes\"&gt;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt; exist on coasts surrounding Barrow, particularly at &lt;a href=\"Roanhead\"&gt;Roanhead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Walney\"&gt;North Walney&lt;/a&gt;. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat coastal shelf, with hillier ground rising to the east of the town, peaking at at Yarlside. Barrow sits on soils deposited during the end of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20glacial%20period\"&gt;Ice Age&lt;/a&gt;, eroded from the mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District%20National%20Park\"&gt;Lake District National Park&lt;/a&gt;, to the north-east. Barrow's soils are composed of glacial lake clay and &lt;a href=\"glacial%20till\"&gt;glacial till&lt;/a&gt;, while Walney is almost entirely made up of reworked glacial morraine. Beneath these soils is a &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; bedrock, from which many of the town's older buildings are constructed.\nBarrow town centre is located to the north-east of the docks, with suburbs also extending to the north and east, as well as onto Walney. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Dalton-in-Furness\"&gt;Dalton-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Askam-in-Furness\"&gt;Askam-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; are the other sizable settlements of the &lt;a href=\"Borough%20of%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Borough of Barrow-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt;. Barrow is the only major urban area in South Cumbria, with the nearest settlements of a similar size being &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morecambe\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt;. Other towns nearby include &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Millom\"&gt;Millom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grange-over-Sands\"&gt;Grange-over-Sands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendal\"&gt;Kendal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windermere%2C%20Cumbria%20%28town%29\"&gt;Windermere&lt;/a&gt;.\nIslands.\nMost of the town is sheltered from the Irish Sea by &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;, a 14\u00a0mile\u00a0(22.5\u00a0km) long island connected to the mainland by the &lt;a href=\"Bascule%20bridge\"&gt;bascule&lt;/a&gt; type &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Bridge\"&gt;Jubilee bridge&lt;/a&gt;. About 13,000 live on the isle's various settlements, mostly in &lt;a href=\"Vickerstown\"&gt;Vickerstown&lt;/a&gt;, which was built to house workers in the rapidly expanding shipyard. Another significant island which lay in the Walney Channel was &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Island%20%28England%29\"&gt;Barrow Island&lt;/a&gt;, but following the filling of the channel to create land for the shipyard it is now directly connected to the town. Other islands which lie close to Barrow are &lt;a href=\"Piel%20Island\"&gt;Piel Island&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Piel%20Castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; protected the harbour from marauding &lt;a href=\"Scot\"&gt;Scot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sheep%20Island%20%28England%29\"&gt;Sheep Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roa%20Island\"&gt;Roa Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Foulney%20Island\"&gt;Foulney Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nParks and open spaces.\nThere are numerous natural and managed public parks and open spaces within Barrow. Walney North and &lt;a href=\"South%20Walney\"&gt;South Nature Reserves&lt;/a&gt; are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as is &lt;a href=\"Sandscale%20Haws\"&gt;Sandscale Haws&lt;/a&gt;. Formal woodland areas within the town include Hawcoat/Ormsgill Quarry, How Tun Woods, &lt;a href=\"Abbot%27s%20Wood%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Abbotswood&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow Steel Works &amp; Slag Bank and Sowerby Wood. The 45-Acre &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Park\"&gt;Barrow Park&lt;/a&gt; is the largest and most centrally located man-made park in the town with smaller parks including Channelside Haven, Hindpool Urban Park and Vickerstown Park. There are also 25 council-owned playgrounds and 15 allotments.\nClimate.\nBarrow on the west coast of Great Britain has a &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"maritime%20climate\"&gt;maritime climate&lt;/a&gt; owing to the North Atlantic current and tends to have milder winters than central and eastern parts of the country. The town lies in &lt;a href=\"Hardiness%20zone\"&gt;Hardiness zone&lt;/a&gt; 9 and has an average yearly temperature of 10.4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDemography.\nPopulation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Barrow council district&lt;/a&gt;, which includes adjacent urban areas, had a population of around 69,100 according to the 2011 census. This is 4% less than the 2001 figure of 71,900, and the highest percentage population loss in the country between 2001 and 2011. The Office for National Statistics states Barrow's population as being in long term decline with a projected population of around 65,000 by 2037. This is largely a result of negative &lt;a href=\"net%20migration\"&gt;net migration&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthnicity and language.\nThe 2011 census states 96.9% of Barrow's population as &lt;a href=\"White%20British\"&gt;White British&lt;/a&gt;, and ethnic minority populations in Barrow stood at 3.1%. Other ethnic groups in Barrow include &lt;a href=\"White%20Other%20%28United%20Kingdom%20Census%29\"&gt;Other White&lt;/a&gt; 1.3%, &lt;a href=\"Asian%20people\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; 1.0%, &lt;a href=\"British%20Mixed\"&gt;Mixed Race&lt;/a&gt; 0.5%, &lt;a href=\"Black%20British\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; 0.1%, &lt;a href=\"British%20Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; 0.1% and &lt;a href=\"Other%20ethnic%20group%20%28United%20Kingdom%20Census%29\"&gt;all other ethnic groups&lt;/a&gt; represented 0.1% of the population. The first people to settle in what is now Barrow were the &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norsemen\"&gt;Scandinavians&lt;/a&gt; followed by the &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20people\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt;. Most Barrovians however are descended from migrants from &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of England who arrived from the late 19th century onwards. Barrow has sizeable &lt;a href=\"British%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; (in particular those originating from Hong Kong), &lt;a href=\"Filipinos%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Indian\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thais%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kosovan%20migration%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Kosovan&lt;/a&gt; communities as well as a &lt;a href=\"Poles%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; population which partly dates back to World War II, however in general Barrow has a much lower proportion of ethnic minorities than national average.\nBarrow's Chinese connections were the subject of a documentary on Chinese state television in 2014. The programme covered diplomat &lt;a href=\"Li%20Hongzhang\"&gt;Li Hongzhang&lt;/a&gt;'s fact finding mission to the town's steelworks and shipyard in 1896 as well as the 2012 discovery of a hoard of Chinese coins discovered in Barrow dated around a similar time that have been suggested as having been brought over by sailors or labourers. The &lt;a href=\"Society%20for%20Anglo-Chinese%20Understanding\"&gt;Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding&lt;/a&gt; is a charity with a branch based in Barrow that aims to develop relations with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Chinese\"&gt;British Chinese&lt;/a&gt; community and the general British population. It was established in 1975 and publishes the quarterly \"China Eye\" magazine.\nIn 2011 93.2% of the borough's population was born in England, 2.6% in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, 0.6% in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and 0.5% in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. 3.1% of the town's 2011 population were born elsewhere in the world, 1.3% of which were born in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The five most common foreign countries of birth were &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. 2018 estimates put the percentage of non-UK born residents at 5%.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 98.8% of Barrovians spoke English as a main language, although around 40 languages are spoken in the town with &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese, and &lt;a href=\"Tagalog%20language\"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; prevailing as the second, third and fourth most common main languages (0.3%, 0.2% and 0.1% of the population respectively). Of the 797 Barrovians who had a main language other than English, 82.9% can speak English well to very well.\nReligion.\nIn the 2011 census 70.7% of Barrow's population stated themselves as being Christian. People stating no religion or chose not to state totalled 28.4% combined. Other religious groups represented 0.9% of the population, with &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; prevailing as the first and second most common groups. Conishead Priory, the first &lt;a href=\"Kadampa\"&gt;Kadampa&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist centre in the west, is home to around 100 Buddhists and is located off the Barrow to Ulverston Coast Road within the &lt;a href=\"South%20Lakeland\"&gt;South Lakeland&lt;/a&gt; district. Historically Barrow was home to a notable &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jewish&lt;/a&gt; community that peaked in size during the 1930s with a synagogue in the town. Nonetheless, it closed in 1974 and only a dozen Jews were recorded by the 2011 census.\nEconomy.\nHistorically Barrow's economy was dominated by the manufacturing sector, with the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Hematite%20Steel%20Company\"&gt;Barrow Hematite Steel Company&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering\"&gt;Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering&lt;/a&gt; being amongst the most important global companies in their respective fields during the 20th century. In the present day, manufacturing remains the largest employment sector in the town. &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; is the single largest employer with around 9,500 employees, and one third of the workforce, as at 2020. However, like most of the UK, employment trends have greatly diversified since the 20th century and there are no other predominant employment sectors in Barrow.\nShipyard and port.\nBarrow has played a vital role in global ship and submarine construction for around 150 years. &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20submarine%20Abd%C3%BCl%20Hamid\"&gt;Ottoman submarine \"Abd\u00fcl Hamid\"&lt;/a&gt; was built in the town in 1886 and became the first submarine in the world to fire a live torpedo underwater, while oil tanker \"British Admiral\" became the first British vessel to exceed 100,000 tonnes when launched in 1965. The vast majority of all current and former Royal Navy submarines were constructed in Barrow as well as numerous &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy%20Fleet%20Flagship\"&gt;Royal Navy Fleet Flagship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%20Maritime%20%E2%80%93%20Submarines\"&gt;BAE Systems Maritime \u2013 Submarines&lt;/a&gt; shipyard at Barrow is the largest in the UK by workforce ahead of &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%20Maritime%20%E2%80%93%20Naval%20Ships\"&gt;BAE Systems Maritime \u2013 Naval Ships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Govan\"&gt;Govan&lt;/a&gt;. It was expanded in 1986 by construction of a new covered assembly facility, the &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Dock%20Hall\"&gt;Devonshire Dock Hall&lt;/a&gt; (DDH), completed by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20McAlpine\"&gt;Alfred McAlpine&lt;/a&gt;, on land that was created by infilling part of the &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Dock\"&gt;Devonshire Dock&lt;/a&gt; with 2.4 million tonnes of sand pumped from nearby Roosecote Sands. DDH is the tallest building in Cumbria at 51\u00a0m. With a length of , width of and an area of it is one of the largest shipbuilding construction complex of its kind in Europe.\nThe DDH provides a controlled environment for ship and submarine assembly, and avoids the difficulties caused by building on the slope of traditional slipways. Outside the hall, a 24,300 tonne capacity shiplift allows completed vessels to be lowered into the water independently of the tide. Vessels can also be lifted out of the water and transferred to the hall. The first use of the DDH was for construction of the s, and later vessels of the were also built there. The shipyard is currently constructing the s, the first of which was launched on 8 June 2007. BAE Systems is currently studying the design of a &lt;a href=\"British%20replacement%20of%20the%20Trident%20system\"&gt;new class&lt;/a&gt; of ballistic missile submarines. BAE Systems also has orders for submarine pressure domes for the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Navy\"&gt;Spanish Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe shipyard has been awarded contracts for the construction of submarines which will carry nuclear missiles in a &lt;a href=\"Dreadnought-class%20submarine\"&gt;successor programme&lt;/a&gt; to the current \"Vanguard\" class containing the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Trident%20programme\"&gt;Trident system&lt;/a&gt;. BAE Systems is investing \u00a3300 million in Barrow's shipyard to construct buildings capable of manufacturing and assembling the new class of submarines. This major development is the largest in 25 years at the shipyard and will see thousands of new jobs created, further cementing its place as the UK's largest shipyard and one of the few to have seen continuous contracts since founding over a century ago.\nThe most recent surface vessels to be constructed in Barrow were and amphibious assault ships and in the early 2000s when the shipyard was part of &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%20Marine\"&gt;BAE Systems Marine&lt;/a&gt; division. It also undertook fitting out and commissioning of helicopter carrier in the mid-1990s after the ship was built by &lt;a href=\"Kvaerner%20Govan\"&gt;Kvaerner Govan&lt;/a&gt; in Glasgow.\n&lt;a href=\"Associated%20British%20Ports%20Holdings\"&gt;Associated British Ports Holdings&lt;/a&gt; owns and operates the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Barrow\"&gt;Port of Barrow&lt;/a&gt; which can berth vessels up to long and with a draught of . The four main docks include &lt;a href=\"Buccleuch%20Dock\"&gt;Buccleuch Dock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cavendish%20Dock\"&gt;Cavendish Dock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Dock\"&gt;Devonshire Dock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramsden%20Dock\"&gt;Ramsden Dock&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter handling almost all of the port's cargo. Buccleuch and Devonshire Docks are utilised primarily by BAE Systems, while Cavendish Dock the largest by surface area is now a reservoir. Principal traffic includes the export of condensate by-product from the production of gas at the &lt;a href=\"Rampside%20Gas%20Terminal\"&gt;Rampside Gas Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, wood pulp and locally quarried limestone which is exported to Scandinavia for use in the paper industry. The port, which has deep water access, also handles the shipment of nuclear fuels and radioactive waste for &lt;a href=\"BNFL\"&gt;BNFL&lt;/a&gt;'s nearby &lt;a href=\"Sellafield\"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt; plant.\n&lt;a href=\"James%20Fisher%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;James Fisher &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt;, a service provider in all sectors of the marine industry and a specialist supplier of engineering services to the nuclear industry in the UK and abroad, was founded in Barrow in 1847. It is listed on the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and is the largest company to have its headquarters in Cumbria. Annual revenue stood at \u00a3307 million in 2012 (up 15% from \u00a3268 million in 2011), as well as staff numbers standing at over 1,500 worldwide, with 120 of those in the Barrow headquarters. Numerous vessels are registered at the Port of Barrow, with the majority being owned by James Fisher &amp; Sons and &lt;a href=\"International%20Nuclear%20Services\"&gt;International Nuclear Services&lt;/a&gt;/Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited.\nEnergy generation.\nIn 1899 Barrow Corporation built and operated the coal-fired &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20power%20station\"&gt;Barrow-in-Furness power station&lt;/a&gt; in Buccleugh Street adjacent to the railway line. This eventually had a generating capacity of 23 MW; it was decommissioned in 1960.\n&lt;a href=\"Roosecote%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Roosecote power station&lt;/a&gt; was a 120 MW coal-fired generating station commissioned in 1953, it was later converted to gas firing and closed in 1986. A 120 MW combined cycle gas turbine station was commissioned in 1991, it was closed in 2012.\u00a0 From 2018 the site has been the location of 49 MW battery storage facility.\nIn 1985, gas was discovered in Morecambe Bay, and to this day the products have been processed onshore at &lt;a href=\"Rampside%20Gas%20Terminal\"&gt;Rampside Gas Terminal&lt;/a&gt; in south Barrow. The complex is operated jointly by &lt;a href=\"Centrica\"&gt;Centrica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ConocoPhillips\"&gt;ConocoPhillips&lt;/a&gt;. Directly adjacent to Rampside Gas Terminal is &lt;a href=\"Roosecote%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Roosecote Power Station&lt;/a&gt; which was the first &lt;a href=\"Combined%20cycle\"&gt;CCGT&lt;/a&gt; power station to supply electricity to the United Kingdom's National Grid. Although originally coal-fired, the station became gas-fired until it was mothballed in 2015.\nBarrow and its wider urban area form part of 'Britain's Energy Coast', and has one of the highest concentrations of &lt;a href=\"wind%20farm\"&gt;wind farm&lt;/a&gt;s in the world, the vast majority are located offshore and have been built during the early 2010s. All four of these wind farms are located off the coast of Walney Island, including the 189 turbine &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Walney Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;, 108 turbine &lt;a href=\"West%20Duddon%20wind%20farm\"&gt;West Duddon wind farm&lt;/a&gt;, 30 turbine &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Offshore%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Barrow Offshore Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; and 30 turbine &lt;a href=\"Ormonde%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Ormonde Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Walney Wind Farm was the largest offshore wind farm in the world upon completion, in 2015 it received government consent to be trebled in size. &lt;a href=\"DONG%20Energy\"&gt;DONG Energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Power\"&gt;Scottish Power&lt;/a&gt; maintain a wind farm operations base with 30 full-time staff members at the Port of Barrow.\n&lt;a href=\"Sellafield\"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heysham%20nuclear%20power%20station\"&gt;Heysham nuclear power station&lt;/a&gt;s are also located within of Barrow.\nTourism and leisure.\nAlthough it is at the end of a peninsula, Barrow is only around 20 minutes from the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow has been referred to as a \"gateway to the lakes\" and \"where the lakes meets the sea\", a status which could be enhanced by the new marina complex and planned cruise ship terminal.\nBarrow itself has several tourist attractions that support just over 1,000 jobs; the town saw a higher growth in tourist expenditure during the 2000s than Cumbria as a whole and had about 2.3 million overnight stays during 2008. Barrow's most popular free-entry tourist attraction is the &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Museum\"&gt;Dock Museum&lt;/a&gt;. The museum tells the history of Barrow (including the steelworks industry, the shipyard and the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Blitz\"&gt;Barrow Blitz&lt;/a&gt;), as well as offering gallery space to local artists and schoolchildren. It is built upon and around an old graving dock. Walney Island has two world-renowned nature reserves (the 130 hectare (0.5 sq mi) South Walney Nature Reserve and the 650 hectare (2.5 sq mi) &lt;a href=\"North%20Walney\"&gt;North Walney Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt;). Both nature reserves have &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt; designation, as do the &lt;a href=\"Duddon%20Estuary\"&gt;Duddon Estuary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandscale%20Haws\"&gt;Sandscale Haws&lt;/a&gt; to the north of the borough. Barrow has a number of beaches which are popular in the summer with sunbathers, kitesurfers and caravanners. They include &lt;a href=\"Earnse%20Bay\"&gt;Earnse Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Biggar Bank, &lt;a href=\"Roanhead\"&gt;Roanhead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rampside\"&gt;Rampside&lt;/a&gt;. The first two of these provide views of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglesey\"&gt;Anglesey&lt;/a&gt; on exceptionally clear days. The wider borough has more than 60\u00a0km of coastline. The Park Leisure Centre is a fitness suite with a pool, set in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Park\"&gt;Barrow Park&lt;/a&gt;. The historic ruins of &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Abbey\"&gt;Furness Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piel%20Castle\"&gt;Piel Castle&lt;/a&gt;, which are both managed by &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt;, are also popular tourist destinations. &lt;a href=\"South%20Lakes%20Safari%20Zoo\"&gt;South Lakes Safari Zoo&lt;/a&gt; is one of Europe's leading conservation zoos and has been voted Cumbria's best tourist attraction in five non-consecutive years although it has a checkered history; it lies within the borough of Barrow-in-Furness on the outskirts of Dalton. The zoo underwent a multi-million pound expansion during the mid-2010s. It now holds thousands of animals and covers an area of making it one of the Northern England's largest such parks.\nBarrow has been described as the Lake District's premier shopping town, with 'big name shops mingling with small local ones'. The town centre is home to a large indoor market and &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Walk%20Shopping%20Centre\"&gt;Portland Walk Shopping Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Barrow has many retail and leisure parks for a town of its size, including &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks%23Cornmill%20Crossing\"&gt;Cornmill Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks%23Cornerhouse%20Retail%20Park\"&gt;Cornerhouse Retail Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks%23Hollywood%20Park\"&gt;Hollywood Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks%23Hollywood%20Park\"&gt;Hindpool Retail Park&lt;/a&gt; and Walney Road Retail Park. Between them they host a number of supermarkets, electrical, home furnishing, clothing and discount stores, gyms, restaurants and Cumbria's largest cinema. Other modern visitor attractions in Barrow include the growing leisure destination at James Freel Close (consisting of an indoor &lt;a href=\"kart%20racing\"&gt;kart racing&lt;/a&gt; complex, &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt; alley, indoor &lt;a href=\"skate%20park\"&gt;skate park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trampoline\"&gt;trampoline&lt;/a&gt; centre and gym), as well as Lazer Zone in Hindpool Road's former &lt;a href=\"Custom%20House%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Custom House&lt;/a&gt; and a similar Lazer Quest, &lt;a href=\"escape%20room\"&gt;escape room&lt;/a&gt; and play centre in the former Hitchens building on Buccleuch Street.\nRegeneration and redevelopment.\nUrban regeneration has been ongoing in Barrow since the 1990s. &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Walk%20Shopping%20Centre\"&gt;Portland Walk Shopping Centre&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1998 anchored by &lt;a href=\"Debenhams\"&gt;Debenhams&lt;/a&gt; as part of a major reconstruction of Barrow town centre. Around the same time the &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks\"&gt;Hindpool Retail Parks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dock%20Museum\"&gt;Dock Museum&lt;/a&gt; were constructed over various former industrial sites in Barrow, including the &lt;a href=\"dry%20dock\"&gt;dry dock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Jute%20Works\"&gt;Barrow Jute Works&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Hematite%20Steel%20Company\"&gt;Barrow Steel Works&lt;/a&gt;. Recent construction projects in the town also include the \u00a343 million expansion of &lt;a href=\"Furness%20College%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Furness College&lt;/a&gt;'s Channelside campus, \u00a322.5 million &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Academy\"&gt;Furness Academy&lt;/a&gt; new build, \u00a314.5 million central Barrow flood relief scheme, \u00a38.5 million Barrow police station, \u00a35 million town centre redevelopment scheme, \u00a34 million Scottish Power wind farm operations centre as well as the North Central Renewal Area, shake up of the town's residential and retirement homes and a number of large-scale hotel schemes catering for the influx of contractors working for BAE Systems (namely &lt;a href=\"Holiday%20Inn%20Express\"&gt;Holiday Inn Express&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Inn\"&gt;Premier Inn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wetherspoon\"&gt;Wetherspoon&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Waterfront%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;The Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; is an ambitious ongoing \u00a3200 million dockland regeneration project, which began in 2007. The project includes a new Barrow Marina Village which will incorporate an \u00a38 million 400-berth marina, 650 homes, restaurants, shops, hotels and a new state of the art bridge across Cavendish Dock. A large watersports centre is also proposed, with the possibility of a cruise ship terminal. Some cruise ships are already scheduled to dock in Barrow, mainly for tourists to visit the Lake District, although there is no official cruise ship terminal yet. Developments have stalled since 2010 when the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Regional%20Development%20Agency\"&gt;Northwest Regional Development Agency&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded and essential government funding was lost. Despite this Barrow Borough Council has since purchased land needed to make the development a reality and currently controls 95% of the site. The executive director of the council has stated construction of the Waterfront could resume by 2017 as economic prospects improve and has pledged funds to conduct a market testing exercise. The allocation of Growth Deal investment (2014\u20132021) will make improvements to the Barrow Waterfront Enterprise Zone far more secure In 2014 a \u00a3300 million investment into the shipyard was announced by BAE Systems, in anticipation of the &lt;a href=\"trident%20replacement\"&gt;new generation of UK nuclear submarines&lt;/a&gt;. Construction will take up to eight years and create thousands of new jobs at the shipyard thereafter. Amongst proposals are an extension to the DDH complex and new buildings in the central yard area off Bridge Road on Barrow Island (a site formerly mooted for a huge construction hall for the construction of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth-class%20aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;\"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; sections which the yard failed to win contracts for), these will house pressure hull units ready for shot blasting and painting, and be a place for joining submarine equipment modules. Redevelopment of the 5.8 hectare central yard area was completed in 2018 and is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Yard%20Complex%20Facility\"&gt;Central Yard Complex Facility&lt;/a&gt; which measures long, wide and tall, only 10% smaller than the volume of the pre-expansion Devonshire Dock Hall.\nOther large-scale developments associated with BAE include a logistics centre which was constructed in the Waterfront Business Park in 2015 and a central training facility which is proposed at Buccleuch Dock Road.\nOther.\nOther major employers include the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29\"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Furness%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Furness General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, which employs 1,800 staff, the &lt;a href=\"Kimberly%20Clark\"&gt;Kimberly Clark&lt;/a&gt; paper mill, which has 400 employees, BAE Systems' &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems%20Land%20%26amp%3B%20Armaments\"&gt;Land and Armaments&lt;/a&gt; division, &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Building%20Society\"&gt;Furness Building Society&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the 20 largest of its kind, &lt;a href=\"Cumbria%20County%20Council\"&gt;Cumbria County Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Barrow Borough Council&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst many retailers that have established themselves in Barrow, the furniture store &lt;a href=\"Stollers\"&gt;Stollers&lt;/a&gt; is noted as being one of the largest shops of its kind in the UK.\nEmployment.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 78.2% of males aged 16\u201364 and females aged 16\u201359 in Barrow were economically active. This figure is higher than the North West and England averages. 73.8% of the population was employed, which again is higher than regional and national averages; the unemployment rate stood at 5.6% which is lower than both averages. Despite this the percentage of people claiming key benefits, which is independent of the unemployment figure, is much higher than both averages at 21.0%, or almost a quarter of all Barrovians of working age. The most common form of benefit received was the &lt;a href=\"Incapacity%20Benefit\"&gt;Incapacity Benefit&lt;/a&gt;, claimed by 11.0% of the adult population, while 4.0% claimed &lt;a href=\"Jobseeker%27s%20Allowance\"&gt;Jobseeker's Allowance&lt;/a&gt;, which is on a par with the national average.\nThe list below shows how many people were employed in certain sectors according to the 2011 census. Little change occurred between the 2001 and 2011 census; Barrow still has a much higher percentage of workers in the manufacturing sector than the national average, ranking third in 2011 behind &lt;a href=\"Borough%20of%20Corby\"&gt;Corby&lt;/a&gt;, Northamptonshire and &lt;a href=\"Borough%20of%20Pendle\"&gt;Pendle&lt;/a&gt;, Lancashire. The percentage working in manufacturing has increased further during the 2010s given thousands of new roles created at the shipyard in association with the Trident renewal programme.\nSouth West Cumbria has one of the UK's most self-contained workforces, and Barrow itself has the sixth lowest proportion of people who travel outside of the country for work. In 2001, 76% of the working age population in Barrow commuted within for work, when compared to the England average of 54%. A significant proportion of the town's population are employed at the &lt;a href=\"Sellafield\"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt; nuclear facility.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nBarrow's principal road link is the &lt;a href=\"A590%20road\"&gt;A590&lt;/a&gt;. This runs to Barrow from the &lt;a href=\"M6%20motorway\"&gt;M6 motorway&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt;, skirting the southern &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;. Just north of Barrow is the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"A595%20road\"&gt;A595&lt;/a&gt;, linking the town to &lt;a href=\"West%20Cumbria\"&gt;West Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;. The A5087 connects Barrow's southern suburbs to Ulverston via a scenic coastal route. &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt; is the principal road through central Barrow, whilst &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Bridge\"&gt;Walney Bridge&lt;/a&gt; connects Barrow Island to &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe possibility of a bridge link over &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20Bay\"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt; is occasionally raised, and feasibility studies have been carried out.\nBus.\nBus services within the town are operated by &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20North%20West\"&gt;Stagecoach North West&lt;/a&gt;. There is no specifically designated bus station, although many bus routes start and end near the town hall. The original bus station, since demolished, was known for its role in a 1970s television commercial for &lt;a href=\"Chewits\"&gt;Chewits&lt;/a&gt; sweets. As well as local suburban and village services, longer-distance buses run to &lt;a href=\"Millom\"&gt;Millom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bowness-on-Windermere\"&gt;Bowness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windermere%2C%20Cumbria%20%28town%29\"&gt;Windermere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kendal\"&gt;Kendal&lt;/a&gt;.\nRail.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20railway%20station\"&gt;Barrow-in-Furness railway station&lt;/a&gt; provides connections to &lt;a href=\"Whitehaven\"&gt;Whitehaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Workington\"&gt;Workington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; to the north, via the &lt;a href=\"Cumbrian%20Coast%20Line\"&gt;Cumbrian Coast Line&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grange-over-Sands\"&gt;Grange-over-Sands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; to the east, via the &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Line\"&gt;Furness Line&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 both of which connect to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Mainline\"&gt;West Coast Mainline&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous daily trains run to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Piccadilly%20station\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. The station handles over 600,000 passengers annually. Barrow has a second railway station, &lt;a href=\"Roose%20railway%20station\"&gt;Roose&lt;/a&gt;, which serves &lt;a href=\"Roose\"&gt;the suburb of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Furness%20Abbey%20railway%20station\"&gt;Furness Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow's third main line station, closed in 1950. There was also a station on &lt;a href=\"Island%20Road%20railway%20station\"&gt;Barrow Island&lt;/a&gt;, for commuters between the shipyard and nearby towns served by the Furness Railway. This railway link was severed in 1966 when the famous cradle bridge across the docks was closed permanently for safety reasons. There were also stations at &lt;a href=\"Piel%20railway%20station\"&gt;Piel&lt;/a&gt;, Rabbit Hill, &lt;a href=\"Rampside%20railway%20station\"&gt;Rampside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramsden%20Dock%20railway%20station\"&gt;Ramsden Dock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Strand%20railway%20station\"&gt;Strand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween 1885 and 1932, the &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Tramways%20Company\"&gt;Barrow-in-Furness Tramways Company&lt;/a&gt; operated a &lt;a href=\"double-decker%20tram\"&gt;double-decker tram&lt;/a&gt; service over several miles, primarily around central Barrow, Barrow Island and Hindpool.\nAir.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrow/Walney%20Island%20Airport\"&gt;Barrow/Walney Island Airport&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"IATA%20airport%20code\"&gt;IATA airport code&lt;/a&gt;: BWF, &lt;a href=\"ICAO\"&gt;ICAO&lt;/a&gt;: EGNL) is a former commercial airport and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; base currently owned by BAE Systems which operates two &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft%20King%20Air\"&gt;Beechkraft King Air&lt;/a&gt; B200 and one B250 aircraft which fly to various destinations across the UK every weekday, including Bristol, Glasgow, London and Manchester. The airport's runways take on a triangular form, the longest runway is almost . The airport was expanded by BAE in 2018 including the construction of a new terminal building, hangar and control tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Airport\"&gt;Manchester Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the closest major airport, with direct links to Barrow railway station and about two hours away by road.\nIn 2018 a &lt;a href=\"heliport\"&gt;heliport&lt;/a&gt; was built on a site adjacent to Park Road, Ormsgill for energy firm &lt;a href=\"%C3%98rsted%20%28company%29\"&gt;\u00d8rsted&lt;/a&gt; and to support the offshore energy sector.\nSea.\nDespite being one of the UK's leading shipbuilding centres, the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20British%20Ports\"&gt;Associated British Ports&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Barrow\"&gt;Port of Barrow&lt;/a&gt; is only a minor port. Historically, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man%20Steam%20Packet\"&gt;Isle of Man Steam Packet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company\"&gt;Barrow Steam Navigation Company&lt;/a&gt; (a subsidiary of the Furness Railway and later &lt;a href=\"London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway\"&gt;London, Midland and Scottish Railway&lt;/a&gt;) operated a number of steamers and passenger ferry services between Rampside and &lt;a href=\"Ramsden%20Dock\"&gt;Ramsden Dock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ardrossan\"&gt;Ardrossan&lt;/a&gt; (Scotland), &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; (Northern Ireland), &lt;a href=\"Blackpool\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; (Isle of Man), &lt;a href=\"Fleetwood\"&gt;Fleetwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heysham\"&gt;Heysham&lt;/a&gt;. All services had ceased operation by the mid-20th century.\nFor a short period during the early 1880s, transatlantic travel was possible from the town. &lt;a href=\"Anchor%20Line%20%28steamship%20company%29\"&gt;The Anchor Line&lt;/a&gt; operated a fortnightly service utilising three of its steamships, \"Alexandria\", \"Caledonia\" and \"Columbia\", between Barrow and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. There are proposals to construct a cruise ship terminal in Barrow as part of the Waterfront redevelopment project.\nSport.\nFootball.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrow%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20Two\"&gt;EFL League Two&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth tier of English football. The team, founded in 1901, are nicknamed the Bluebirds and play their home games at the &lt;a href=\"Holker%20Street\"&gt;Holker Street&lt;/a&gt; stadium. The side were members of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; until they failed to be re-elected in 1972. In 1990, they won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Trophy\"&gt;FA Trophy&lt;/a&gt; beating &lt;a href=\"Leek%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Leek Town&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the final at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281924%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, London. Twenty years later, on 8 May 2010, &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt; repeated the feat, beating &lt;a href=\"Stevenage%20F.C.\"&gt;Stevenage Borough&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 after extra time.\nAfter 48 years in non-league football, Barrow were crowned champions of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28division%29\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; on 17 June 2020, sealing their return to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nFootball players born in Barrow include England internationals &lt;a href=\"Emlyn%20Hughes\"&gt;Emlyn Hughes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gary%20M.%20Stevens\"&gt;Gary Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Hadley\"&gt;Harry Hadley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vic%20Metcalfe\"&gt;Vic Metcalfe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf current professional footballers, &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Curtis\"&gt;Wayne Curtis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20F.C.\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt; striker, and Iran Under-20 and &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; winger Shana Haji both hail from the town.\n&lt;a href=\"Holker%20Old%20Boys%20F.C.\"&gt;Holker Old Boys&lt;/a&gt;, based at Rakesmoor Lane, are an amateur football team that play in the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;North West Counties Football League&lt;/a&gt; Division One.\nRugby.\nThe town is considered one of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;'s traditional heartlands at semi-professional and amateur levels. &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Raiders\"&gt;Barrow Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, the town's semi-professional team, whose home games are at &lt;a href=\"Craven%20Park%20%28Barrow%29\"&gt;Craven Park&lt;/a&gt;, currently operate in &lt;a href=\"League%201%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;RFL League 1&lt;/a&gt;, the bottom tier of rugby league, after being relegated from the &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Championship\"&gt;RFL Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.\nIn the 1950s the side played in three &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals, winning the last of these against &lt;a href=\"Workington%20Town\"&gt;Workington Town&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1997 reorganisation of the sport the original Barrow RLFC team merged with &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%20RLFC\"&gt;Carlisle Border Raiders&lt;/a&gt; to form Barrow Border Raiders, with the word \"border\" later dropped. Players who were born in the town and played at a professional level include brothers &lt;a href=\"Ade%20Gardner\"&gt;Ade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mat%20Gardner\"&gt;Mat Gardner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Horne\"&gt;Willie Horne&lt;/a&gt;. The latter captained Barrow to their Challenge Cup victory and represented Great Britain at an international level. He was inducted into the \"Barrow Hall of Fame\" along with former Barrow players &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Jackson%20%28rugby%20league%20born%201932%29\"&gt;Phil Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Lewthwaite\"&gt;Jimmy Lewthwaite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt an amateur level, eight rugby league teams participate in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20%26amp%3B%20District%20League\"&gt;Barrow &amp; District League&lt;/a&gt;. They include Askam, Barrow Island, Dalton, Hindpool, Millom, Roose Pioneers, Ulverston and Walney.\nGolf.\nBarrow is home to two large golf clubs. Barrow Golf Club, founded in 1922, is in &lt;a href=\"Hawcoat\"&gt;Hawcoat&lt;/a&gt; and covers some with 18 holes. Furness Golf Club, founded in 1872, is the sixth oldest golf club in England and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is located on &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt;, just from the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers an 18-hole course, a shop and other facilities. The Furness Golf Centre is located on the outskirts of Barrow close to Roanhead and is home to a 14-bay driving range, golf shop, swing studio and the Fairway Hotel. The hoaxer &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Flitcroft\"&gt;Maurice Flitcroft&lt;/a&gt;, known as the \"world's worst golfer\" lived and worked in the town.\nMotor sports.\nBarrow has staged &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20speedway\"&gt;speedway&lt;/a&gt; racing at three venues since the pioneer days in the late 1920s. The first track was at Holker Street. This venue had a revival for a short spell in the early to mid-1970s being utilised by the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Bombers\"&gt;Barrow Bombers&lt;/a&gt;. In 1930 the sport moved to Little Park but this a somewhat hazy venue. The sport had a revival in 1978 at Park Avenue Industrial Estate but this was relatively short lived.\nBike racing.\nBarrow has produced a number of noteworthy motorcyclists throughout the years, such as Manx Grand Prix winner Eddie Crooks, TT Rider Dan Stewart, Speedway ace &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Roynon\"&gt;Adam Roynon&lt;/a&gt; and multiple British Sandtrack Champion John Pepper.\nKarting.\nKart racer Kristian Brierley received national attention after successfully winning the internationally televised TKM Karting Festival in 2015. He followed this up by winning the opening round of the British Championship in 2016 and ultimately went on to finish the season in 6th place.\nMultiple other 'Barrovians' have also competed at national level in karting such as Max Davis, Daniel Pepper, Kieran Pepper, Mark Fell, Oliver Dilks and Jake Calvert.\nIn 2020 Max Davies became the first person from the Barrow area to be selected to represent Team GB at the ROK World Finals where he finished 29th overall out of 75 competitors from 25 competing countries, he was also the youngest member of Team GB to compete that year.\nIn 2021 Max Davies was selected for Team GB again as was fellow 'Barrovian' Daniel Pepper after Pepper had finished that years British championship in 2nd with Davies placing in 3rd.\nPepper's 2nd place finish in the 2021 British Championship gave him the highest placed seeding of a Barrow born driver in the 21st century, breaking the record of his own brother Kieran Pepper who had been seeded 3rd the previous year.\nMark Fell remains the only driver from the Barrow area to have won a British Championship which dates back to the early 1990s.\nOther sports.\nBarrow is home to the &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Terriers\"&gt;Walney Terriers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20Football\"&gt;American Football&lt;/a&gt; club, formed in 2011 the club originally trained at Memorial Fields on Walney Island before establishing training grounds elsewhere in Barrow and Ulverston. The Terriers play in the North West conference of the &lt;a href=\"British%20American%20Football%20Association\"&gt;BAFA&lt;/a&gt;'s National League alongside the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Titans\"&gt;Manchester Titans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merseyside%20Nighthawks\"&gt;Merseyside Nighthawks&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the town's most notable annual sporting events is the &lt;a href=\"Keswick%20to%20Barrow\"&gt;Keswick to Barrow&lt;/a&gt; (K2B), a walking and running event that has taken place every year since 1967 between &lt;a href=\"Keswick%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Keswick&lt;/a&gt; and Barrow. The event has raised millions for charity and regularly sees in excess of 3,000 participants.\nBarrow Born Orienteer and Fell Runner Carl Hill was selected to carry the olympic torch for a stage through Morecambe in the buildup to the 2012 summer Olympics. He was nominated for this honor by his father David Hill who was proud of his sons accomplishments in running for England and Great Britain in Orienteering whilst also provided a large portion of his time to getting kids into sport.\nCulture.\nBarrow, although one of the country's smallest local authorities, contains a wealth of natural and built heritage assets, which includes 274 &lt;a href=\"Listed%20building\"&gt;Listed Buildings&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;SSSIs&lt;/a&gt;. The 2016 Heritage Index formed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Society of Arts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund\"&gt;Heritage Lottery Fund&lt;/a&gt; placed the borough as sixth highest of 325 English districts for 'assets' with especially high scores relating to nationally important landscape and natural heritage assets and industrial heritage assets.\nArchitecture.\nBarrow is one of Britain's few planned towns, and the spacious tree-lined avenues within the oldest parts of the town (including Central Barrow, Hindpool and Salthouse) are more akin to the layout of a much larger city. The town centre is distinguished by its &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edwardian%20era\"&gt;Edwardian era&lt;/a&gt; civic buildings, such as the &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Main%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Main Public Library&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Nan%20Tait%20Centre\"&gt;Technical School&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Central%20Fire%20Station\"&gt;Central Fire Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvation%20Army\"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt; Building, &lt;a href=\"Custom%20House%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Custom House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Westminster%20Bank%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;National Westminster Bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%20Hotel\"&gt;The Duke of Edinburgh Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;St. George's Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary%20of%20Furness%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;St. Mary's RC Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%27%20Church%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;St. James' Church&lt;/a&gt;. Oppositely, several distinctive buildings have been demolished in Barrow since the mid-20th century as a result of neglect or war damage, amongst the most iconic are &lt;a href=\"Abbot%27s%20Wood%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Abbots Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20railway%20station\"&gt;Barrow Central Railway Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infield%20House\"&gt;Infield House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%27s%20Square%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness%23North%20Lonsdale%20Hospital\"&gt;North Lonsdale Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotch%20Buildings\"&gt;Scotch Buildings&lt;/a&gt; and the Waverley Hotel. Lancaster architects &lt;a href=\"Sharpe%2C%20Paley%20and%20Austin\"&gt;Sharpe, Paley and Austin&lt;/a&gt; were prolific throughout the development of Barrow. A number of Barrow's landmark buildings were constructed from locally sourced sandstone, evident from the high number of brown and red coloured stone buildings in the town. Similar materials were used in a number of local buildings in the early 20th century, and often accompanied by terracotta. There are also an increasing number of modern office buildings as well as the shipyard's construction halls which dominate much of Barrow's skyline. Despite much of Barrow having been constructed from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries, architectural styles vary greatly across the town from the &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Whinnerah%20Institute\"&gt;John Whinnerah Institute&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20architecture\"&gt;Byzantine style&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%20Church%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;St. John's Church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20architecture\"&gt;Neo-Elizabethan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20House%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Abbey House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Tudor Revival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vickerstown\"&gt;Vickerstown&lt;/a&gt; estate.\nBarrow has 8 &lt;a href=\"Grade%20I%20listed%20buildings\"&gt;Grade I listed buildings&lt;/a&gt;, 15 &lt;a href=\"Listed%20building\"&gt;Grade II*&lt;/a&gt; and 249 &lt;a href=\"Grade%20II\"&gt;Grade II&lt;/a&gt; buildings. The majority of Grade I listed buildings and structures are in and around the Furness Abbey complex while many Grade II* listed buildings in the town are 19th century tenements on Barrow Island including the &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Buildings\"&gt;Devonshire Buildings&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of &lt;a href=\"Conservation%20Area%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Conservation Areas&lt;/a&gt; across Barrow named as such for their architectural or historical significance, they include &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Island%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Barrow Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biggar%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Biggar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Barrow\"&gt;Central Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Abbey\"&gt;Furness Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Scale\"&gt;North Scale&lt;/a&gt;, North and South &lt;a href=\"Vickerstown\"&gt;Vickerstown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%27s%20Square%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;St. George's Square&lt;/a&gt;. Historically Barrow's skyline was dominated by shipyard cranes and industrial chimneys, although little evidence of this remains in the present day with the last &lt;a href=\"Crane%20%28machine%29%23Hammerhead%20crane\"&gt;hammerhead crane&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the iconic yellow crane of &lt;a href=\"Buccleuch%20Dock\"&gt;Buccleuch Dock&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 being dismantled in 2011, despite calls for listing status like the smaller &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Clydebank\"&gt;Titan Clydebank&lt;/a&gt; in Glasgow. The tallest building in Barrow is &lt;a href=\"Devonshire%20Dock%20Hall\"&gt;Devonshire Dock Hall&lt;/a&gt; at . Also worth of note are the turbines of &lt;a href=\"Ormonde%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;Ormonde Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt; located just off the coast of Barrow which stand at .\nIn terms of housing, the majority of dwellings in Barrow are Victorian &lt;a href=\"Terraced%20house\"&gt;terraces&lt;/a&gt;. At 47.0% of local housing stock in 2011, the figure is much higher than England's average of 24.5%. 29.7% of dwellings are &lt;a href=\"semi-detached\"&gt;semi-detached&lt;/a&gt;, 12.09% &lt;a href=\"Single-family%20detached%20home\"&gt;detached&lt;/a&gt; and 10.2% flats, maisonettes or apartments. Great variety in housing styles is a feature across central Barrow, Barrow Island, Hindpool, and Vickerstown. Most were built around a &lt;a href=\"Grid%20plan\"&gt;grid design&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with plans drawn up by James Ramsden.\nArts.\nMusic\nBarrow has produced several musical performers of note. They include &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Round\"&gt;Thomas Round&lt;/a&gt;, a singer and actor in D'Oyly Carte productions of &lt;a href=\"Savoy%20Opera\"&gt;Savoy Opera&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Cornick\"&gt;Glenn Cornick&lt;/a&gt;, the original bass guitarist in the rock band &lt;a href=\"Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29\"&gt;Jethro Tull&lt;/a&gt;. Paul MacKenzie, bass player with 1980s &lt;a href=\"Preston%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt;-based thrash metal band &lt;a href=\"Xentrix\"&gt;Xentrix&lt;/a&gt;, is from Barrow. More recently, hip-hop DJ and record producer &lt;a href=\"Aim%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Aim&lt;/a&gt; has had considerable commercial success.\nExpressive arts\nSeveral notables in Art and Literature have come from Barrow. Artist &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Tyson\"&gt;Keith Tyson&lt;/a&gt;, the 2002 &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Prize\"&gt;Turner Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner, was born in nearby &lt;a href=\"Ulverston\"&gt;Ulverston&lt;/a&gt;, attended the Barrow-in-Furness College of Engineering and worked at the then &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering\"&gt;VSEL&lt;/a&gt; shipyard. &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Spry\"&gt;Constance Spry&lt;/a&gt;, the author and florist who revolutionised interior design in the 1930s, and 1940s, moved to the town with her son Anthony during World War I to work as a welfare supervisor. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Purves\"&gt;Peter Purves&lt;/a&gt;, later a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Peter\"&gt;Blue Peter&lt;/a&gt; presenter, began his acting career with 2 years as a member of the Renaissance Theatre Company at the town's Her Majesty's Theatre.\nDuring the mid-20th century, Barrow contained a wealth of theatres/cinemas including the Coliseum, Electric Theatre, Essoldo, Her Majesty's Theatre, Hippodrome, Pavilion, &lt;a href=\"Ritz%20Cinema%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Ritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roxy%20Cinema%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Roxy&lt;/a&gt;, Royalty Theatre and Tivoli. All but the Pavilion and Roxy have since been demolished, most recently in 2004 with the demolition of the Apollo (formerly the Ritz). The Canteen Media &amp; Arts Centre \u2013 known simply as \"The Canteen\" \u2013 and &lt;a href=\"Forum%2028\"&gt;The Forum&lt;/a&gt; are now the main venues for theatre, while the &lt;a href=\"Vue%20Cinemas\"&gt;Vue Cinema&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hindpool%20Retail%20Parks%23Hollywood%20Park\"&gt;Hollywood Park&lt;/a&gt; is the only cinema in the town.\nLiterature\nIn fictional works, Barrow and &lt;a href=\"Vickerstown\"&gt;Vickerstown&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Walney%20Island\"&gt;Walney Island&lt;/a&gt; featured in children's book series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Railway%20Series\"&gt;The Railway Series&lt;/a&gt;\", which developed into the show \"&lt;a href=\"Thomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine\"&gt;Thomas the Tank Engine&lt;/a&gt;\", as the point where the fictional &lt;a href=\"Sodor%20%28fictional%20island%29\"&gt;Island of Sodor&lt;/a&gt; connected to mainland Britain and the national rail network.\nA number of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Poets\"&gt;Lake Poets&lt;/a&gt; have referred to locations in present day Barrow, with one notable example being &lt;a href=\"William%20Wordsworth\"&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt;'s 1805 autobiographical poem \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Prelude\"&gt;The Prelude&lt;/a&gt;\" which describes his visits to Furness Abbey. The Portuguese poet &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Pessoa\"&gt;Fernando Pessoa&lt;/a&gt; wrote a series of &lt;a href=\"sonnet\"&gt;sonnet&lt;/a&gt;s called \"Barrow-on-Furness\" (sic). His \"heteronym\" &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20de%20Campos\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro de Campos&lt;/a&gt; lived in Barrow when he was studying ship engineering, but Pessoa himself had never visited, and mistakenly assumed that \"Furness\" was the name of a river. According to narrative exposition in Chapter five of &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20L.%20Sayers\"&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers&lt;/a&gt;' 1926 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Clouds%20of%20Witness\"&gt;Clouds of Witness&lt;/a&gt;\", Inspector Charles Parker, Lord Peter Wimsey's friend and eventual brother-in-law, attended Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Renowned novelist &lt;a href=\"D.%20H.%20Lawrence\"&gt;D. H. Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; was in Barrow during the outbreak of World War I and wrote about his experiences in the town. The 2015 novel \"&lt;a href=\"Career%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Career of Evil&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"J.%20K.%20Rowling\"&gt;J. K. Rowling&lt;/a&gt;'s pseudonym Robert Galbraith was parially set in Barrow.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nThere is one paid-for evening daily paper, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mail%20%28Cumbria%29\"&gt;The Mail&lt;/a&gt;\". There is also a weekly freesheet called the \"Advertiser\", which is delivered to most households in the Furness area.\nRadio.\nBarrow is served by one commercial radio station, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20North%20West\"&gt;Heart North West&lt;/a&gt;, which broadcasts from Manchester and serves the area around &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20Bay\"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Another commercial station, &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20FM\"&gt;Abbey FM&lt;/a&gt;, ceased broadcasting in February 2009 when it went into administration. The BBC's local radio service is &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%20Cumbria\"&gt;BBC Radio Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarrow and the Furness area is served by local community radio CandoFM. CandoFM broadcasts to the Barrow and Furness area on 106.3FM, Ulverston and surrounding areas on 107.3FM, across South Cumbria and North Lancashire on DAB plus globally available online. CandoFM is in Cooke Studios, Abbey Road, Barrow-in-Furness and run by 50+ volunteers providing local information as well as an eclectic mix of shows. CandoFM for the Community, By the Community, In the Community.\nTelevision.\nBarrow lies in the &lt;a href=\"Granada%20TV\"&gt;Granada TV&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20England\"&gt;North West England&lt;/a&gt; region with the main signal coming from the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Hill%20transmitting%20station\"&gt;Winter Hill&lt;/a&gt; transmitter near &lt;a href=\"Bolton\"&gt;Bolton&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a relay transmitter at &lt;a href=\"Millom\"&gt;Millom&lt;/a&gt; whose signal can be received in the northern end of the town.\nVarious television personalities were born in the district. Dave Myers was a biker born in Barrow, and found fame as one half of television cookery duo &lt;a href=\"the%20Hairy%20Bikers\"&gt;the Hairy Bikers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Taylor%20%28comedian%29\"&gt;Karen Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is a TV comedian best known for her BBC Three sketch show \"&lt;a href=\"Touch%20Me%2C%20I%27m%20Karen%20Taylor\"&gt;Touch Me, I'm Karen Taylor&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Dixon%20%28newsreader%29\"&gt;Steve Dixon&lt;/a&gt; is a newsreader for Sky News, while &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Kneale\"&gt;Nigel Kneale&lt;/a&gt; was a well-known film and television scriptwriter.\nWartime diarist and local housewife &lt;a href=\"Nella%20Last\"&gt;Nella Last&lt;/a&gt;'s memoirs were adapted for television, with parts of the town used in filming. The resulting programme, \"&lt;a href=\"Housewife%2C%2049\"&gt;Housewife, 49&lt;/a&gt;\", written by and starring comedian &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Wood\"&gt;Victoria Wood&lt;/a&gt;, was broadcast by ITV in 2006. It won two &lt;a href=\"British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards%202007\"&gt;BAFTA&lt;/a&gt; awards \u2013 one for Best Single Drama, the other for Best Actress (Wood).\nCITV children's show \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Treacle%20People\"&gt;The Treacle People&lt;/a&gt;\" had two villains named Barrow and Furness.\nDialect and accent.\nFurness is unique within Cumbria and the local dialect and accent is fairly &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20dialect%20and%20accent\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;-orientated. Until 1974 Furness was an &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; of Lancashire, however as with &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the \"Barrovian\" dialect has been influenced by large numbers of settlers from various regions. During the town's rapid growth from 1860 onward, thousands came to Barrow from &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in northern England. As &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20patter\"&gt;Glaswegian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geordie\"&gt;Geordie&lt;/a&gt; dialects mingled in Barrow numerous more migrated from Lancashire and other parts of England which in effect created the noticeably &lt;a href=\"Northern%20England%20English\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; \"Barrovian\" dialect. In general the \"Barrovian\" accent tends to drop certain letters (including \"H\" and \"T\").\nNightlife.\nThere are many pubs and &lt;a href=\"working%20men%27s%20club\"&gt;working men's club&lt;/a&gt;s in Barrow. Barrow has fourteen of the latter, one of the highest number per capita of any British town. There are also many bars and clubs found primarily in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Barrow\"&gt;Barrow town centre&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Street%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Duke Street&lt;/a&gt; and Cornwallis Street. Popular venues on Duke Street include the following bars: Jefferson's, the Buddha Bar, Bar Cairo and the Drawing Room. They did have a &lt;a href=\"Yates%27s\"&gt;Yates's&lt;/a&gt; but the building was deemed unsafe and has since been demolished. Cornwallis Street \u2013 often dubbed the \"\"&lt;a href=\"Gaza%20Strip\"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;\"\" by locals \u2013 is currently undergoing a multi-million pound renovation with the former Martini's being the flagship renovation into Club M. Other clubs on Cornwallis Street include: Kavanna's, O'Sullivan's and Skint. Between 2004 and 2010 Barrow was home to one of North West England's largest nightclubs, the -capacity Blue Lagoon occupied the entire hull of the former Danish ferry &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Selandia\"&gt;Princess Selandia&lt;/a&gt;, which has now left the town. Barrow's largest nightclub is now &lt;a href=\"Roxy%20Cinema%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Manhattans&lt;/a&gt;, which opened on Cavendish Street in late 2011.\nFood.\nA traditional favourite food in Barrow is the &lt;a href=\"pie\"&gt;pie&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly the &lt;a href=\"meat%20and%20potato%20pie\"&gt;meat and potato pie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pie%20shop\"&gt;Pie shop&lt;/a&gt;s are common, and Green's of Jarrow Street is noted as a favourite of Barrow-born celebrity chef &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Myers%20%28presenter%29\"&gt;Dave Myers&lt;/a&gt; and journalist Martin Tarbuck, who declared them to be Britain's best pies in a book dedicated to the subject.\nBarrow was also the home of &lt;a href=\"soft-drink\"&gt;soft-drink&lt;/a&gt; company Marsh's, which produced a distinctive &lt;a href=\"sarsaparilla%20%28soft%20drink%29\"&gt;sarsaparilla&lt;/a&gt;-flavoured fizzy drink known as \"Sass\". Marsh's was purchased by Purity Soft Drinks of Birmingham in 1993, and the company stopped producing Sass in 1999. Remaining bottles have subsequently sold for high prices as a collector's item. A new product, labelled \"Barrow Sass\", was launched in 2014 in a bid to replicate traditional Sass. The coasts around Barrow have rich &lt;a href=\"Cockle%20%28bivalve%29\"&gt;cockle&lt;/a&gt; beds from which cockles have traditionally been gathered, although numbers have been low following intensive gathering during the early 2000s, in the run-up to the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Morecambe%20Bay%20cockling%20disaster\"&gt;2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster&lt;/a&gt;. One of England's few remaining &lt;a href=\"Oyster%20farming\"&gt;Oyster farms&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=\"Biggar%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Biggar&lt;/a&gt; area of Walney. Traditional &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20sausage\"&gt;Cumberland sausage&lt;/a&gt;s are less associated with Barrow itself than the rest of Cumbria, but are readily available from the surrounding rural area. Cumbria has produced a number of famed dishes and is home to countless &lt;a href=\"Michelin%20Guide\"&gt;Michelin Guide&lt;/a&gt; restaurants, one of which is in Dalton.\nSocial issues.\nLifestyle.\nHaving emerged as mixture of working-class cultures from across Britain and Ireland in the 19th century, subsequent low levels of migration and a continued tradition of industrial employment mean that Barrow's culture still reflects many of the traditions of the British &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2008, Barrow was named as the most working-class location in the United Kingdom, based on a series of measures devised to judge the lifestyle of the people. The research was carried out by Locallife.co.uk which determined that there is a &lt;a href=\"Fish%20and%20chips\"&gt;fish and chip shop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"working%20men%27s%20club\"&gt;working men's club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bookmaker\"&gt;bookmaker&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Trade%20union\"&gt;trade union office&lt;/a&gt; for every 2,917 people (&lt;a href=\"Crewe\"&gt;Crewe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doncaster\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Preston%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt; completed the top five of 'the most working class places in Britain'). This is in direct contrast to the 1870s, when a developing Barrow had more &lt;a href=\"Aristocracy%20%28class%29\"&gt;aristocrats&lt;/a&gt; per head of the population than anywhere else in the country.\nIn the 2015 &lt;a href=\"Deprivation%20index\"&gt;Indices of Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow was ranked as the 44th most deprived district in England (out of a total of 326). The equivalent figures for 2007 and 2010 stood at 29th most deprived and 32nd most deprived respectively. The Indices of Deprivation is based on income, employment, education, health, crime and barriers to housing and services and living environment. Within these subcategories, most notably Barrow ranked as the 5th most deprived in terms of health deprivation and disability, and in huge contrast, 324th most deprived in terms of access to housing and services (i.e. 3rd least deprived). In the 2010 Indices of Deprivation, the majority of areas in Barrow Island, Central, Hindpool, Ormsgill were amongst the 3% most deprived areas in the country, while large parts of suburban Barrow including Newbarns and Roose were amongst the 25% of least deprived areas in England.\nHealth.\nThe principal hospital in Barrow is &lt;a href=\"Furness%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Furness General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, operated by the &lt;a href=\"University%20Hospitals%20of%20Morecambe%20Bay%20NHS%20Trust\"&gt;University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust&lt;/a&gt; and located on the outskirts of the town. As of July 2010 there were 12 NHS GP practices/doctors' surgeries and 5 NHS dental surgeries in Barrow. The &lt;a href=\"life%20expectancy\"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; for males in Barrow is 77.1 years (compared to the England average of 79.5) and 81.5 years for females (compared to the national average of 83.2). A 2016 &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29\"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; in depth publication on health in Barrow indicated that the population of Barrow is by most measures in a worse state than the national average. Indicators such as hospital stays for alcohol related harm, excessive weight, diabetes, smoking related death and self-harm are significantly worse than the England average. However, a number of indicators are similar to the average or are significantly better, including rates of homelesness, STI transmission and road deaths.\" Barrow has the tenth worst rate of &lt;a href=\"Incapacity%20Benefit\"&gt;Incapacity Benefit&lt;/a&gt; claimants for &lt;a href=\"Mental%20disorder\"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt; in the country.\nCrime.\nPolicing is by &lt;a href=\"Cumbria%20Constabulary\"&gt;Cumbria Constabulary&lt;/a&gt;, which alongside the county of Cumbria was formed in 1974. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Police\"&gt;Ministry of Defence Police&lt;/a&gt; maintain a presence on Barrow Island around the shipyard also. Previously the town was policed by Barrow-in-Furness Borough Police. Barrow previously had one full-time police station in Market Street in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Barrow\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; ward. A new multi-million pound building was built on James Freel Close on Channelside in &lt;a href=\"Hindpool\"&gt;Hindpool&lt;/a&gt; and is the town's only police station, with extra jail cells and improved facilities. Several consecutive annual publications by Cumbria Constabulary entitled the 'Cumbria Community Safety Strategic Assessment' have stated that overall crime in Barrow is declining, with some indicators far better than the national average. Despite this, crime levels as a whole are higher than the national average: 2013 statistics show crime levels in the borough as the 16th worst in the UK; most notably, Barrow has amongst the worst rates of alcohol misuse in the country. Between July and December 2013 Barrow saw an average of 7.39 crimes per 100 of the population; the UK average was 6.57. Incidents of anti-social behaviour stood at 7.83 per 100 in Barrow, cf 5.02 in the UK. Burglary averaged 0.53 per 100 in 2013 while the national average was 1.00 per 100. Robbery averaged 0.02 in Barrow and 0.07 nationwide, shoplifting 0.72 and 0.53 and vehicle crime at 0.31 and 0.58. Violent crimes and sexual offences occurred at a rate of 1.70 per 100, significantly higher than UK average of 1.06 and ranking the area as the 29th worst out of 348 in the country. Crime rates remain the highest in deprived areas of inner wards such as Central and Hindpool.\nSince November 2019 &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Police\"&gt;Ministry of Defence Police&lt;/a&gt; have been based at the &lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; Shipyard.\nEducation.\nEducation in the state-funded sector includes fifteen &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt;s, five &lt;a href=\"infant%20school\"&gt;infant school&lt;/a&gt;s, five &lt;a href=\"junior%20school\"&gt;junior school&lt;/a&gt;s and many nurseries. The three &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt;s in the town are: &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Academy\"&gt;Furness Academy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Bernard%27s%20Catholic%20High%20School\"&gt;St. Bernard's Catholic High School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walney%20School\"&gt;Walney School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chetwynde%20School\"&gt;Chetwynde School&lt;/a&gt; is an all-through school for children aged 4 to 18. Formerly an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;independent school&lt;/a&gt;, Chetwynde became a state-funded &lt;a href=\"Free%20school%20%28England%29\"&gt;free school&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nIn the further education sector there is one college, &lt;a href=\"Furness%20College%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Furness College&lt;/a&gt;. Furness College merged with &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Sixth%20Form%20College\"&gt;Barrow Sixth Form College&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 forming the largest college in Cumbria. Technical and professional qualifications are delivered at the Channelside campus, with A' levels delivered at the Rating Lane campus, the home of the former sixth form college. Although there is no &lt;a href=\"higher%20education\"&gt;higher education&lt;/a&gt; institution based in Barrow, Furness College offers several higher apprenticeships, &lt;a href=\"foundation%20degree\"&gt;foundation degree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;Bachelor's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20degree\"&gt;Master's&lt;/a&gt; programmes accredited by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cumbria\"&gt;University of Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;University of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Central%20Lancashire\"&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town's main library is the &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness%20Main%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Central Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ramsden%20Square\"&gt;Ramsden Square&lt;/a&gt;, situated near the town centre. The library was established in 1882 in a room near the town hall, and moved to its current premises in 1922. A branch of the County Archive Service, opened in 1979 and containing many of the town's archives, is located within adjoining premises, whilst until 1991 the library also housed the Furness Museum, a forerunner of the Dock Museum. Smaller branch libraries are currently provided at &lt;a href=\"Walney\"&gt;Walney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roose\"&gt;Roose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Island%2C%20Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Barrow Island&lt;/a&gt;.
