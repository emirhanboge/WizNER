    "text": "Chris Charteris (born 1966) is a &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; sculptor, jeweller and carver.\nEarly life and education.\nCharteris was born in &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, adopted into a &lt;a href=\"Pakeha\"&gt;Pakeha&lt;/a&gt; family as a young child, and told he was &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt;, before discovering much later that he was of &lt;a href=\"Kiribati\"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fijians\"&gt;Fijian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; descent. He began his artistic training in &lt;a href=\"Kaitaia\"&gt;Kaitaia&lt;/a&gt; in Maori carving and design.\nBetween 1986 and 1996, he worked as a carving tutor at &lt;a href=\"Otago%20Polytechnic\"&gt;Otago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Southland Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Dunedin%20College%20of%20Education\"&gt;Dunedin College of Education&lt;/a&gt;'s Arai Te Uru Kokiri Youth Learning Centre. In 1995, he established Te Whare Whakairo Gallery and Workshop in &lt;a href=\"Dunedin\"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHe has exhibited at FhE Galleries in Auckland with \"Tuanako\" in 2011, \"To the Heart of the Matter\" in 2010, and \"Matau\" 2008. His work has been included in the group exhibition \"Wunderr\u016bma: New Zealand Jewellery\", exhibited at &lt;a href=\"The%20Dowse%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;The Dowse Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Hutt\"&gt;Lower Hutt&lt;/a&gt; and at Galerie Handwerk in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. His work was also part of \"Pasifika Styles\" at the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Archaeology%20and%20Anthropology%2C%20University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. His work was included in the third and fourth New Zealand Jewellery Biennials, \"Turangawaewae: A Public Outing\", held at &lt;a href=\"The%20Dowse%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;The Dowse Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, and \"Grammar: Subjects and Objects\", held in 2001.\n1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens.\nIn 1999 Charteris collaborated with jewellers &lt;a href=\"Niki%20Hastings-McFall\"&gt;Niki Hastings-McFall&lt;/a&gt; and Sofia Tekala-Smith on the exhibition \"1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens\" at Judith Anderson Gallery in Auckland, which helped draw attention to a new generation of New Zealand artists of Pacific descent and showed \u201cwhat contemporary jewellers might offer to contemporary Pacific identity \u2212 notably a sense of playful appropriation of Pacific adornment that is ironic and serious at the same time.\u201d\nThe exhibition was accompanied by a publication titled &lt;a href=\"http%3A//natlib.govt.nz/records/20976483\"&gt;\"1 Noble Savage, 2 Dusky Maidens\"&lt;/a&gt; with reproductions of the three artists' work and essays by Mark Kirby, &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Taouma\"&gt;Lisa Taouma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Thomas\"&gt;Nicholas Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. The publication's catalogue featured a photograph of the three artists in a faux-ethnographic style, dressed in traditional manner and mimicking the conventions of photographs taken in Samoa in the 1890s for Western consumption, as a comment on stereotypical presentations of Pacific peoples.\nNow and Then.\nIn 2010 Charteris again held a joint exhibition with Hastings-McFall titled \"Now and Then\" at the RH Gallery at Woollaston in Nelson. The overarching principle of the 2010 exhibition was 'Va', or the Samoan concept of 'the space between'. In his work for the exhibition Charteris explored new materials, using car paint, magnets and mother of pearl in one work, and nikau bark in another.\nTungaru: the Kiribati project.\nIn 2014 Charteris collaborated with designer and director Jeff Smith on \"Tungaru: the Kiribati project\". The two artists travelled to &lt;a href=\"Kiribati\"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt; and on their return made a number of works that were displayed at the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20War%20Memorial%20Museum\"&gt;Auckland War Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ngere%20Arts%20Centre%20-%20Ng%C4%81%20Tohu%20o%20Uenuku\"&gt;Mangere Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt;. At the Museum items from the Pacific collection were mixed with new art works by Charteris, a digital interactive by Smith, and archival film footage; items from the Museum's collection were also shown with new works by Smith and Charteris at the Mangere Arts Centre.\nThe new work at the Mangere Arts Centre included a large-scale installation titled \"Te ma\" (Fish-trap). 7.4 metres long and 4.6 metres wide, the work was inspired by the heart-shaped fish traps built off the shores of Kiribati; Charteris used 8000 pairs of &lt;a href=\"Dosinia%20anus\"&gt;Ringed Venus&lt;/a&gt; shells to recreate the walls of the fish trap, which in Kiribati are made of broken coral.\nThe exhibition was accompanied by a publication, \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//natlib.govt.nz/records/34854698\"&gt;Tungaru: the Kiribati project&lt;/a&gt;\", with an extended essay by Mark Amery, and photographs of the artists' research visit to Kirbati and their works.\nThe exhibition toured to &lt;a href=\"Pataka%20Art%20%2B%20Museum\"&gt;Pataka Art + Museum&lt;/a&gt; and Hastings City Art Gallery in 2015.\nCollections.\nHis work is held in the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa\"&gt;Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Dowse%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;The Dowse Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20War%20Memorial%20Museum\"&gt;Auckland War Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Archaeology%20and%20Anthropology%2C%20University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;."
