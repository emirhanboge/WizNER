    "text": "Cadia is a genus of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the subfamily &lt;a href=\"Faboideae\"&gt;Faboideae&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most plants in the Faboideae, it has radially symmetrical &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s. In related species with bilateral symmetry, such as those of \"&lt;a href=\"Lupinus\"&gt;Lupinus&lt;/a&gt;\", the dorsal (upper or adaxial) part of the flower expresses one or more genes in the \"Cycloidea\" (\"CYC\")/\"Dichotoma\" (\"DICH\") family. In \"Cadia\", these genes are expressed throughout the flower. Thus, from a molecular point of view, \"Cadia\" is not reversing the ancestral evolution from radial symmetry to bilateral symmetry, but obtaining radial symmetry from a new mechanism."
