    "text": "The New York City Museum School (NYCMS) is a public school for grades 9\u201312 on West 17th Street in &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%2C%20Manhattan\"&gt;Chelsea, Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It shares a building with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Lab%20School%20for%20Collaborative%20Studies\"&gt;New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe school's curriculum requires weekly visits to museums all over New York City, where an NYCMS teacher conducts class in conjunction with Museum staff, and it has been a model for similar programs in other cities. These visits supplement conventional classes held inside the school.\nNYCMS provides education to a heterogeneous group of students from a diverse community. \nThe museum opened in September 1994 as a fully accredited school and was co-founded by &lt;a href=\"Sonnet%20Takahisa\"&gt;Sonnet Takahisa&lt;/a&gt;, staff member at the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Museum\"&gt;Brooklyn Museum&lt;/a&gt; with whom the school partnered. The &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Museum%20of%20Manhattan\"&gt;Children's Museum of Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; was also among its founding partners."
