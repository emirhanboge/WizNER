    "text": "The RMS \"Pannonia\" was a &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20crossing\"&gt;transatlantic&lt;/a&gt; passenger &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Cunard%20Line\"&gt;Cunard steamship company&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was originally ordered by the shipping company &lt;a href=\"Furness%20Withy\"&gt;Furness Withy&lt;/a&gt;, and purchased by Cunard prior to her launch on 5 September 1902. She started her maiden voyage on 28 May 1904, which was from &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fiume\"&gt;Fiume&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. The captain of the \"Pannonia\" from 1 January 1911 until January 1912 was &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Rostron\"&gt;Arthur Rostron&lt;/a&gt;, who later rescued the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"RMS%20Titanic\"&gt;\"Titanic\"&lt;/a&gt;. In May 1916 she became a troopship carrying troops from Canada to France. She left New York on 18 April 1922 for the last time, calling at Plymouth and Cherbourg, then finally to Hamburg, Germany where she was laid up until being sold for scrap in October.\""
