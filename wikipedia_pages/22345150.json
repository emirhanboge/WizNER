    "text": "The 3rd Cavalry Division \"&lt;a href=\"Amadeo%20I%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta&lt;/a&gt;\" () was a &lt;a href=\"Cavalry\"&gt;Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; or \"Celere\" (Fast) &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Italian Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The division was formed in 1934, and during World War II was mobilized in June 1940. As a cavalry division it took part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; and was part of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Expeditionary%20Corps%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Annihilated during the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Little%20Saturn\"&gt;Operation Little Saturn&lt;/a&gt; in December 1942, the survivors returned to &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in spring 1943.\nHistory.\nThe division was formed on 1 November 1934 as 3rd Fast Division \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\" in &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;. Although not officially sanctioned the division is considered to be the heir of the 3rd Cavalry Division of Lombardy, which fought in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and consisted of the V and VI cavalry brigades and was based in Milan. The division consisted of the III Cavalry Brigade \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\" and the 3rd Cavalry Artillery Regiment. The cavalry brigade consisted of the cavalry regiments &lt;a href=\"Regiment%20%26quot%3BSavoia%20Cavalleria%26quot%3B%20%283rd%29\"&gt;Regiment \"Savoia Cavalleria\" (3rd)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regiment%20%26quot%3BLancieri%20di%20Novara%26quot%3B%20%285th%29\"&gt;Regiment \"Lancieri di Novara\" (5th)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Bersaglieri%20Regiment\"&gt;8th Bersaglieri Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, and the III Light Tank Group \"San Giorgio\". On 1 February 1938 the III Cavalry Brigade \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\" was dissolved and its units came under direct command of the division.\nWorld War II.\nIn March 1941 the division had to transfer its 3rd Fast Artillery Regiment with the II and III motorized groups to &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, where they were used to reform the &lt;a href=\"17th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPavia%26quot%3B\"&gt;17th Infantry Division \"Pavia\"&lt;/a&gt;'s 26th Artillery Regiment, which had been destroyed by British forces during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Beda%20Fomm\"&gt;Battle of Beda Fomm&lt;/a&gt; on 6-7 February 1941. The division participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Milan on 31 May 1941. There the division received on 23 June the two remaining artillery groups of its two sister divisions &lt;a href=\"1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%26quot%3BEugenio%20di%20Savoia%26quot%3B\"&gt;1st Cavalry Division \"Eugenio di Savoia\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Cavalry%20Division%20%26quot%3BEmanuele%20Filiberto%20Testa%20di%20Ferro%26quot%3B\"&gt;2nd Cavalry Division \"Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro\"&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed the \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\" to raise the 3rd Horse Artillery Regiment for the division's upcoming &lt;a href=\"Italian%20participation%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Front\"&gt;deployment to the Eastern front&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern Front.\nOn 13 August 1941 the division reached Dniprodzerzhynsk (today &lt;a href=\"Kamianske\"&gt;Kamianske&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dnieper\"&gt;Dnieper&lt;/a&gt; river in central &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, where the division took up position to the right of the &lt;a href=\"9th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPasubio%26quot%3B\"&gt;9th Infantry Division \"Pasubio\"&lt;/a&gt;. On 28 September the Pasubio forced the river and the division's of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Expeditionary%20Corps%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia&lt;/a&gt; went on the offensive, which brought them to Stalino (today &lt;a href=\"Donetsk\"&gt;Donetsk&lt;/a&gt;) by 13 October. After a month of fierce combat Stalino and nearby &lt;a href=\"Horlivka\"&gt;Horlivka&lt;/a&gt; were taken. The divisions continued their slowing offensive until 25th December, when the Soviets launched a determined counterattack and the front stabilized afterwards.\nOn 15 March 1942 the division was radically reorganized: it received the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Bersaglieri%20Regiment\"&gt;6th Bersaglieri Regiment&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Cavalry%20Division%20%26quot%3BEmanuele%20Filiberto%20Testa%20di%20Ferro%26quot%3B\"&gt;2nd Cavalry Division \"Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro\"&lt;/a&gt;, the 120th Motorized Artillery Regiment, the LXVII Armored Bersaglieri Battalion (two companies of &lt;a href=\"L6/40\"&gt;L6/40&lt;/a&gt; light tanks), the IX Mortar Battalion, the XIII Squadrons Group/ Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Alessandria\" (14th), with two squadrons of &lt;a href=\"Semovente%2047/32\"&gt;Semovente 47/32&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"self-propelled%20gun\"&gt;self-propelled gun&lt;/a&gt;s, and an expanded complement of mortars and anti-tank weapons. The division's two cavalry regiments, the horse artillery regiment and the III Light Tanks Group \"San Giorgio\" were removed from the division and formed the independent Horse Troops Grouping under direct command of the &lt;a href=\"8th%20Army%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;8th Italian Army&lt;/a&gt;. With the new units and equipment the 3rd Cavalry Division was now structured similar to Italian motorized divisions.\nIn April 1942, the division was further reinforced when the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Transport%20Brigade\"&gt;Croatian Light Transport Brigade&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the front and was attached to the \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\". From 30 July to 9 August the two &lt;a href=\"Bersaglieri\"&gt;Bersaglieri&lt;/a&gt; regiments eliminated the Soviet bridgehead at &lt;a href=\"Serafimovich%20%28town%29\"&gt;Serafimovich&lt;/a&gt; and later that month, with the support of German tanks, the Bersaglieri repelled a Soviet attack during the first defensive battle of the Don.\nBy late autumn 1942, the 8th Italian Army was placed on the left flank of the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German 6th Army&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n forces. The &lt;a href=\"6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German 6th Army&lt;/a&gt; was then investing Soviet General &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Chuikov\"&gt;Vasily Chuikov&lt;/a&gt;'s 62nd Army in Stalingrad. The &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Army%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Italian front line&lt;/a&gt; stretched along the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; river for more than from the positions of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Second%20Army\"&gt;Hungarian 2nd Army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalmiskowa\"&gt;Kalmiskowa&lt;/a&gt; to the positions of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Army%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Romanian 3rd Army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Veshenskaya\"&gt;Veshenskaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Little Saturn.\nOn 17 December the Soviets began &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Little%20Saturn\"&gt;Operation Little Saturn&lt;/a&gt; and under immense pressure of superior Soviet armored forces the Italian divisions had to retreat from the Don the next day, but the motorized Soviet formations overtook the Italians and therefore repeatedly the Italians had to fight their way through Soviet defensive lines on their way towards &lt;a href=\"Poltava\"&gt;Poltava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dnipropetrovsk\"&gt;Dnipropetrovsk&lt;/a&gt;. After three weeks in the icy desert of the &lt;a href=\"Steppe\"&gt;Steppe&lt;/a&gt; the survivors crossed the &lt;a href=\"Donez\"&gt;Donez&lt;/a&gt; river. The few remaining troops formed a &lt;a href=\"Kampfgruppe\"&gt;Kampfgruppe&lt;/a&gt; and continued to fight until February 1943. The last troops were withdrawn to Italy in March 1943 and garrisoned in &lt;a href=\"Bologna\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imola\"&gt;Imola&lt;/a&gt;, where the process of rebuilding the division began.\nAfter the announcement of the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20of%20Cassibile\"&gt;Armistice of Cassibile&lt;/a&gt; on 8 September 1943 the division and its units were disbanded on 15 September 1943 after brief resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Achse\"&gt;invading German forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nAugust 1940.\nThe division had undergone a level of mechanization and fielded two cavalry regiments, a &lt;a href=\"Bersaglieri\"&gt;Bersaglieri&lt;/a&gt; regiment, a motorized artillery regiment, and a light tank group. The squadrons of the cavalry regiments were horse-mounted and, other than a motorcycle company, the Bersaglieri were issued with bicycles. The light tank group had a total of 61 &lt;a href=\"L3/35\"&gt;L3/35&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"L6/40\"&gt;L6/40&lt;/a&gt; tanks.\nAttached during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Invasion of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in 1941:\nAugust 1942.\nAfter the reorganization in August 1942 the division consisted of the following units:\nMilitary honors.\nFor their conduct during the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20participation%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Front\"&gt;campaign in the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Italy\"&gt;President of Italy&lt;/a&gt; awarded the division's units six &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Medal%20of%20Military%20Valour\"&gt;Gold Medals of Military Valour&lt;/a&gt; - Italy's highest military honor. This makes the 3rd Cavalry Division \"Principe Amedeo Duca d'Aosta\" together with the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Alpine%20Division%20%26quot%3BJulia%26quot%3B\"&gt;3rd Alpine Division \"Julia\"&lt;/a&gt; the two highest decorated Italian divisions of World War II.\nCommanding officers.\nThe division's commanding officers were:"
