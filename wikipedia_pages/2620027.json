    "text": "The Mingrelians (; ) are an indigenous &lt;a href=\"Kartvelian%20languages\"&gt;Kartvelian&lt;/a&gt;-speaking &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20subgroups\"&gt;ethnic subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Georgians&lt;/a&gt; that mostly live in the &lt;a href=\"Mingrelia\"&gt;Mingrelia&lt;/a&gt; (; ) region of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. They also live in considerable numbers in &lt;a href=\"Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tbilisi\"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt;. In the pre-1930 Soviet census, the Mingrelians were afforded their own &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20group\"&gt;ethnic group&lt;/a&gt; category, alongside with many other ethnic subgroups of Georgians.\nThe Mingrelians speak the &lt;a href=\"Mingrelian%20language\"&gt;Mingrelian language&lt;/a&gt;, and are typically bilingual also in &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;. Both these languages belong to the &lt;a href=\"Kartvelian%20languages\"&gt;Kartvelian language family&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the 13th century &lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;BC&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Colchis\"&gt;Colchis&lt;/a&gt; was formed as a result of the increasing consolidation of the tribes inhabiting the region, which covered modern western Georgia. The endonym \"margalefi\" (\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d2\u10d0\u10da\u10d4\u10e4\u10d8) is presumably reflected in the Greek \"Manraloi\" (\u039c\u03ac\u03bd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9), recorded as a people of Colchis by &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt; in the 2nd century BC.\nBy the mid-3rd century, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of Lazica (or &lt;a href=\"Lazica\"&gt;Egrisi&lt;/a&gt; in Georgian sources). In the 5th century, the first Christian king &lt;a href=\"Gubazes%20I%20of%20Lazica\"&gt;Gubazes I of Lazica&lt;/a&gt; declared &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"state%20religion\"&gt;state religion&lt;/a&gt; of Lazica. Locals began to have closer contact with the Greeks and acquired various &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Hellenic&lt;/a&gt; cultural traits, including in some cases the language. From 542 to 562, Lazica was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sassanid&lt;/a&gt; empires, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Lazic%20War\"&gt;Lazic War&lt;/a&gt;. Emperor &lt;a href=\"Heraclius\"&gt;Heraclius&lt;/a&gt;'s offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the &lt;a href=\"Rashidun%20Caliphate\"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt; in the second half of the 7th century.\nIn the 7th century Lazica fell to the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20rule%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;Muslim conquest&lt;/a&gt;; however, in the 8th century combined Lazic and &lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abasgian&lt;/a&gt; forces successfully repelled the Arab occupation. In 780 Lazica was incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Kingdom of Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; as a result of dynastic succession, the latter led the unification of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Georgian monarchy&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th century. The nobility and clergy of Lazica switched from the Hellenic ecclesiastic tradition to the Georgian, and Georgian became the language of culture and education. After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Mingrelia was an autonomous principality within the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Imereti\"&gt;Kingdom of Imereti&lt;/a&gt;, until being annexed by the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century.\nIn several censuses under the Russian Empire and the early &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, Mingrelian were considered a separate group, largely because at the time of the annexation Mingrelia was politically separate from eastern Georgia, the historical political and cultural centers of the Medieval Georgian Kingdoms. They were reclassified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. Currently, most Mingrelian identify themselves as a subgroup of the Georgian nation and have preserved many characteristic cultural features \u2013 including the Mingrelian language \u2013 that date back to the pre-Christian &lt;a href=\"Colchis\"&gt;Colchian&lt;/a&gt; era.\n&lt;a href=\"Lavrentiy%20Beria\"&gt;Lavrentiy Beria&lt;/a&gt;, the Chief of &lt;a href=\"Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt;'s secret police, was a Mingrelian. (As is well-known, Stalin himself was a Georgian.)\nThe first President of an independent Georgia, &lt;a href=\"Zviad%20Gamsakhurdia\"&gt;Zviad Gamsakhurdia&lt;/a&gt; (1939\u20131993), was a Mingrelian and also a creator of Georgian nationalism. Therefore, after the violent coup d'\u00e9tat of December 21, 1991 \u2013 January 6, 1992, Mingrelia became the centre of a &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with the defeat of Gamsakhurdia's supporters.\nApproximately 180,000\u2013200,000 Mingrelian and other subgroups of &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Georgian people&lt;/a&gt; have been expelled from Abkhazia as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Abkhaz%E2%80%93Georgian%20conflict\"&gt;Abkhaz\u2013Georgian conflict&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s and the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20cleansing%20of%20Georgians%20in%20Abkhazia\"&gt;ethnic cleansing of Georgians&lt;/a&gt; in this separatist region."
