    "text": "The Tibesti Mountains are a &lt;a href=\"mountain%20range\"&gt;mountain range&lt;/a&gt; in the central &lt;a href=\"Sahara\"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt;, primarily located in the extreme north of &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, with a small portion located in southern &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. The highest peak in the range, &lt;a href=\"Emi%20Koussi\"&gt;Emi Koussi&lt;/a&gt;, lies to the south at a height of and is the highest point in both Chad and the Sahara. &lt;a href=\"Bikku%20Bitti\"&gt;Bikku Bitti&lt;/a&gt;, the highest peak in Libya, is located in the north of the range. The central third of the Tibesti is of volcanic origin and consists of five &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt;es topped by large depressions: Emi Koussi, &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Toon\"&gt;Tarso Toon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Voon\"&gt;Tarso Voon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Yega\"&gt;Tarso Yega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toussid%C3%A9\"&gt;Toussid\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Major &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;lava flow&lt;/a&gt;s have formed vast plateaus that overlie &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; sandstone. The volcanic activity was the result of a continental &lt;a href=\"hotspot%20%28geology%29\"&gt;hotspot&lt;/a&gt; that arose during the &lt;a href=\"Oligocene\"&gt;Oligocene&lt;/a&gt; and continued in some places until the &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"fumaroles\"&gt;fumaroles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mud%20pool\"&gt;mud pool&lt;/a&gt;s and deposits of &lt;a href=\"natron\"&gt;natron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Erosion\"&gt;Erosion&lt;/a&gt; has shaped volcanic spires and carved an extensive network of canyons through which run rivers subject to highly irregular flows that are rapidly lost to the desert sands.\nTibesti, which means \"place where the mountain people live\", is the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Toubou%20people\"&gt;Toubou people&lt;/a&gt;. The Toubou live mainly along the &lt;a href=\"wadi\"&gt;wadi&lt;/a&gt;s, on rare &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;oases&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"palm%20tree\"&gt;palm tree&lt;/a&gt;s and limited &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt;s grow. They harness the water that collects in &lt;a href=\"guelta\"&gt;guelta&lt;/a&gt;s, the supply of which is highly variable from year-to-year and decade-to-decade. The plateaus are used to graze livestock in the winter and harvest grain in the summer. Temperatures are high, although the altitude ensures that the range is cooler than the surrounding desert. The Toubou, who were settled in the range by the 5th century BC, adapted to these conditions and turned the range into a large natural fortress. They arrived in several waves, taking refuge in times of conflict and dispersing in times of prosperity, although not without intense internal hostility at times.\nThe Toubou came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Carthage\"&gt;Carthaginians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berbers\"&gt;Berbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuaregs\"&gt;Tuaregs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; colonists who first entered the range in 1914 and took control of the area in 1929. The independent spirit of the Toubou and the geopolitics of the region has complicated the exploration of the range as well as the ascent of its peaks. Tensions continued after Chad and Libya gained independence in the mid-20th century, with hostage-taking and armed struggles occurring amid disputes over the allocation of natural resources. The geopolitical situation and the lack of infrastructure has hampered the development of tourism.\nThe Saharomontane &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, which include the &lt;a href=\"rhim%20gazelle\"&gt;rhim gazelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20sheep\"&gt;Barbary sheep&lt;/a&gt;, have adapted to the mountains, yet the climate has not always been as harsh. Greater &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; existed in the past, as evidenced by scenes portrayed in &lt;a href=\"rock%20art\"&gt;rock and parietal art&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the range, which date back several millennia, even before the arrival of the Toubou. The isolation of the Tibesti has sparked the cultural imagination in both art and literature.\nToponymy.\nThe Tibesti Mountains are named for the &lt;a href=\"Toubou%20people\"&gt;Toubou people&lt;/a&gt;, also written \"Tibu\" or \"Tubu\", that inhabit the area. In the &lt;a href=\"Kanuri%20language\"&gt;Kanuri language&lt;/a&gt;, \"tu\" means \"rocks\" or \"mountain\" and \"bu\" means \"a person\" or \"dweller,\" and thus \"Toubou\" roughly translates to \"people of the mountains\" and \"Tibesti\" to the \"place where the mountain people live\".\nMost of the mountain names are derived from &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Teda%20language\"&gt;Tedaga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dazaga%20language\"&gt;Dazaga&lt;/a&gt; languages. The term \"ehi\" precedes the names of peaks and rocky hills, \"emi\" precedes those of larger mountains, and \"tarso\" precedes high plateaus and gently-sloping mountainsides. For example, the Ehi Mousgou is a stratovolcano near &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Voon\"&gt;Tarso Voon&lt;/a&gt;. The name Toussid\u00e9 means \"that which killed the Tou,\" as in the Toubou, reflecting the danger of the still active volcano. The name of &lt;a href=\"Barda%C3%AF%2C%20Chad\"&gt;Barda\u00ef&lt;/a&gt;, the principal town in the range, means \"cold\" in &lt;a href=\"Chadian%20Arabic\"&gt;Chadian Arabic&lt;/a&gt;. In the Tedaga language, the town is known as \"Goumodi\", which means \"red pass,\" signifying the color of the mountains at dusk.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe mountains lie on the border between &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, straddling the Chadian region of &lt;a href=\"Tibesti%20Region\"&gt;Tibesti&lt;/a&gt; and the Libyan districts of &lt;a href=\"Murzuq%20District\"&gt;Murzuq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kufra%20District\"&gt;Kufra&lt;/a&gt;, around north of &lt;a href=\"N%27djamena\"&gt;N'djamena&lt;/a&gt; and south-southeast of &lt;a href=\"Tripoli\"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;. The range is adjacent to &lt;a href=\"Niger\"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; and located approximately halfway between the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Sidra\"&gt;Gulf of Sidra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt;, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Cancer\"&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Rift\"&gt;East African Rift&lt;/a&gt; is to the east and the &lt;a href=\"Cameroon%20line\"&gt;Cameroon line&lt;/a&gt; lies to the southwest.\nThe range is in length, in width, and spans . It draws a large triangle with sides of and vertices facing south, northwest and northeast in the heart of the Sahara, making it the largest mountain range of the desert.\nTopography.\nThe highest peak in the Tibesti Mountains, as well as the highest point in Chad and the Sahara Desert, is the Emi Koussi, located at the southern end of the range. Other prominent peaks include Pic Toussid\u00e9 at and the Timi on its western side, the Tarso Yega, the Tarso Tieroko, the Ehi Mousgou, the Tarso Voon, the Ehi Sunni, and the Ehi Y\u00e9y near the center of the range. The Mouskorb\u00e9 is a peak notable for its height in the northeastern part of the mountain range. The &lt;a href=\"Bikku%20Bitti\"&gt;Bikku Bitti&lt;/a&gt;, the highest point in Libya, is nearby, on the other side of the border. The average elevation of the Tibesti Mountains is about ; sixty percent of its area exceeds in elevation.\nThe range includes five &lt;a href=\"shield%20volcano\"&gt;shield volcano&lt;/a&gt;es with broad bases whose diameter can reach : Emi Koussi; Tarso Toon, which rises above sea level; Tarso Voon; Tarso Yega; and &lt;a href=\"Toussid%C3%A9\"&gt;Tarso Toussid\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, which culminates in the peak of the same name. Several of these peaks are topped with large calderas. Tarso Yega has the largest caldera, with a diameter of and a depth of approximately , while Tarso Voon has the deepest caldera, with a depth of approximately and a diameter of . They are complemented by four large &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt; complexes, high and several km wide, all located in the central part of the mountain range: Tarso Tieroko; Ehi Y\u00e9y; Ehi Mousgou; and Tarso Abeki, which rises to above sea level. These volcanic complexes are now considered inactive, but according to the &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian%20Institution\"&gt;Smithsonian Institution&lt;/a&gt; were active during the &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt;. Tarso Toussid\u00e9 is an active volcano that has spewed lava over the past two millennia. Gases escaping from &lt;a href=\"fumarole\"&gt;fumarole&lt;/a&gt;s on Toussid\u00e9 are visible when evaporation is low. The volcano's crater, &lt;a href=\"Trou%20au%20Natron\"&gt;Trou au Natron&lt;/a&gt;, is in diameter and deep. On the northwest side of Tarso Voon is the &lt;a href=\"Soborom%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Soborom geothermal field&lt;/a&gt;, which contains mud pools and fumaroles that vent &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; has stained the surrounding soil bright colors. Fumaroles are also present at the Yi Yerra &lt;a href=\"hot%20springs\"&gt;hot springs&lt;/a&gt; on Emi Koussi. &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20T%C3%B4h\"&gt;Tarso T\u00f4h&lt;/a&gt; was an active volcano in the early Holocene. The volcanic area of the Tibesti Mountains is located entirely in Chad; it covers about a third of the total area of the Tibesti Mountains and is responsible for between of rock.\nThe rest of the Tibesti Mountains consists of &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20plateau\"&gt;volcanic plateau&lt;/a&gt;s (\"tarsos\"), located between elevation, as well as &lt;a href=\"lava%20field\"&gt;lava field&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ejecta\"&gt;ejecta&lt;/a&gt; deposits. The plateaus are larger and more numerous in the east: the &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Emi%20Chi\"&gt;Tarso Emi Chi&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarso Aozi, the &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Ahon\"&gt;Tarso Ahon&lt;/a&gt; to the north of Emi Koussi, and the Tarso Mohi. In the center is Tarso Ourari at about . To the west, in the vicinity of Tarso Toussid\u00e9, is the aforementioned Tarso T\u00f4h, a small plateau at just , and the even smaller Tarso Tamertiou at . The plateaus are strewn with &lt;a href=\"lava%20plug\"&gt;volcanic spires&lt;/a&gt; and are separated by canyons that have been formed by the irregular flow of &lt;a href=\"wadi\"&gt;wadi&lt;/a&gt;s. After often-violent rains, they see the formation of ephemeral streams and flora. The southern, southwestern and eastern slopes of the mountain range have a gentle rise, while the northern slope of the range is a cliff overlooking the vast Libyan &lt;a href=\"desert%20pavement\"&gt;desert pavement&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"Serir Tibesti\".\nHydrology.\nFive rivers in the northern half of the Tibesti Mountains flow to Libya, while the southern half belongs to the &lt;a href=\"endorheic%20basin\"&gt;endorheic basin&lt;/a&gt; of Lake Chad. However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may flow great distances through subterranean &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe wadis in the Tibesti are called \"enneris\". The water mainly originates from the storms that periodically rage over the mountains. Their flow is highly variable. For example, the largest wadi, named Bardagu\u00e9 (or Enneri Zoumeri on its upstream portion) and located in the northern part of the range, recorded a flow of in 1954, yet over the next nine years it experienced four years of total drought, four years of flow less than and one year where three different flow rates were measured: .\nTwo other major rivers cut into the mountains: the Enneri Yebige flows northward until its riverbed disappears on the \"Serir Tibesti\", while Enneri Touaoul joins the south-flowing Enneri Ke to form Enneri Miski, which then disappears in the plains of &lt;a href=\"Borkou\"&gt;Borkou&lt;/a&gt;. Their basins are separated by an high &lt;a href=\"Drainage%20divide\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; that runs from Tarso Tieroko in the west to Tarso Mohi in the east. The Enneri Tijitinga is the longest wadi in the range, flowing some southward. It forms in the west of the range and peters out in the &lt;a href=\"Bod%C3%A9l%C3%A9%20Depression\"&gt;Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression&lt;/a&gt;, as does Enneri Miski a little further to the east, along with other wadis such as the Enneri Korom and Enneri Aouei. Several rivers flow radially on the southern slopes of the Emi Koussi before seeping into the sands of Borkou and then reemerging at &lt;a href=\"escarpment\"&gt;escarpment&lt;/a&gt;s up to south of the summit, near the &lt;a href=\"Ennedi%20Plateau\"&gt;Ennedi Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the bottom of many canyons are &lt;a href=\"guelta\"&gt;guelta&lt;/a&gt;s, wetlands that accumulate water mainly during storms. Above , \"enneri\" beds sometimes contain sequential pools of water that . The water is replenished several times a year during flooding, and salinity levels are low. The Mare de Zoui is a small permanent body of water above sea level, located in the northern part of the mountains in the wadi of the Enneri Bardagu\u00e9, east of &lt;a href=\"Barda%C3%AF\"&gt;Barda\u00ef&lt;/a&gt;. Supplied by sources upstream of the wadi, in heavy rains it overflows and spills into small &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Yi Yerra hot springs is located on the southern flank of Emi Koussi at about elevation. Water emerges from the springs at . A dozen hot springs are also located at the Soborom geothermal field on the northwest side of Tarso Voon, where water emerges at temperatures ranging between .\nGeology.\nThe Tibesti Mountains are a large area of &lt;a href=\"tectonic%20uplift\"&gt;tectonic uplift&lt;/a&gt; that, according to contemporary theory, resulted from a &lt;a href=\"mantle%20plume\"&gt;mantle plume&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"craton\"&gt;craton&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"African%20plate\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lithosphere\"&gt;lithosphere&lt;/a&gt;, which is about thick. This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via &lt;a href=\"subduction\"&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt;, of a &lt;a href=\"rift%20zone\"&gt;rift zone&lt;/a&gt;. A system of regional &lt;a href=\"Fault%20%28geology%29\"&gt;faults&lt;/a&gt;, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of &lt;a href=\"Cameroon%20line\"&gt;Cameroon line&lt;/a&gt;, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rift%20Valley\"&gt;Great Rift Valley&lt;/a&gt;; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Basement%20%28geology%29\"&gt;basement&lt;/a&gt; of the Tibesti is composed of &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"schist\"&gt;schist&lt;/a&gt;, one of six exposures of &lt;a href=\"Precambrian\"&gt;Precambrian&lt;/a&gt; crystalline rock in &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;. These are overlaid by &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; era, while the peaks consist of &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20rock\"&gt;volcanic rock&lt;/a&gt;. The continental &lt;a href=\"Hotspot%20%28geology%29\"&gt;hotspot&lt;/a&gt; activity began as early as the &lt;a href=\"Oligocene\"&gt;Oligocene&lt;/a&gt;, although most of the volcanic rock dates from the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Miocene\"&gt;Lower Miocene&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; and, in places, to the Holocene. Due to the comparatively slow movement of the African plate\u2014roughly between per year since the Lower Miocene\u2014there is no relationship between the age of the volcanoes and their dimensions, geographic distribution or alignment, in contrast to hotspots such as the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%E2%80%93Emperor%20seamount%20chain\"&gt;Hawaiian\u2013Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cook%20Islands\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Austral%20Islands\"&gt;Austral&lt;/a&gt; seamount chains. This phenomenon is also seen in &lt;a href=\"Martian%20volcanoes\"&gt;Martian volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"Elysium%20Mons\"&gt;Elysium Mons&lt;/a&gt;. Early volcanic activity created &lt;a href=\"trap%20basalt\"&gt;trap basalt&lt;/a&gt; formations that extend tens of kilometers and stack up to thick. &lt;a href=\"Basanite\"&gt;Basanite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; are also found in the volcanic layer. More recently in &lt;a href=\"Geologic%20time%20scale\"&gt;geologic time&lt;/a&gt;, volcanic activity has deposited &lt;a href=\"dacite\"&gt;dacite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rhyolite\"&gt;rhyolite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ignimbrite\"&gt;ignimbrite&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"trachyte\"&gt;trachyte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trachyandesite\"&gt;trachyandesite&lt;/a&gt;. This trend towards the production of more &lt;a href=\"felsic\"&gt;felsic&lt;/a&gt;, viscous lavas could be a sign of a waning mantle plume.\nGeomorphology.\nVolcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases. In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area. The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Y\u00e9y. The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions. In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast \"tarsos\", as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast. Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Yega\"&gt;Tarso Yega&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarso%20Toon\"&gt;Tarso Toon&lt;/a&gt;, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Y\u00e9y; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas. This phase also saw the formation of the Bouna\u00ef lava dome and Tarso Voon. To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi. Emi Koussi increased in height. The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussid\u00e9 and the lava flows of Tarso T\u00f4h in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise. In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane. Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussid\u00e9 and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared. Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussid\u00e9 formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussid\u00e9. With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance.\nThe Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters have formed even more recently, with the former dissecting the earlier Toussid\u00e9 calderas. Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small &lt;a href=\"cinder%20cone\"&gt;cinder cone&lt;/a&gt;s, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi. there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussid\u00e9. &lt;a href=\"Carbonate\"&gt;Carbonate&lt;/a&gt; deposits in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters are also representative of more recent volcanic activity.\nThe study of &lt;a href=\"fluvial%20terrace\"&gt;fluvial terrace&lt;/a&gt;s has revealed coarse &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; alternating with terraces of &lt;a href=\"silt\"&gt;silt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; and fine sand. This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the &lt;a href=\"Quaternary%20Period\"&gt;Quaternary Period&lt;/a&gt;. The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely significantly denser than that which exists today. Furthermore, the discovery of calcified &lt;a href=\"charophyta\"&gt;charophyta&lt;/a&gt; (particularly of the family &lt;a href=\"Characeae\"&gt;Characeae&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"gastropod\"&gt;gastropod&lt;/a&gt; fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least deep during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Pleistocene\"&gt;Late Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt;. These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last &lt;a href=\"glacial%20maximum\"&gt;glacial maximum&lt;/a&gt;, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures. In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad%23History\"&gt;Paleolake Chad&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"5th%20millennium%20BC\"&gt;5th millennium BC&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThe Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20Desert\"&gt;Sahara Desert&lt;/a&gt;, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year. In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the &lt;a href=\"Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone\"&gt;Intertropical Convergence Zone&lt;/a&gt; (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt;al air. Normally, the ITCZ repels the &lt;a href=\"Harmattan\"&gt;Harmattan&lt;/a&gt;, a dry &lt;a href=\"trade%20wind\"&gt;trade wind&lt;/a&gt; that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti. However, sometimes the &lt;a href=\"weather%20front\"&gt;front&lt;/a&gt; retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry. In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese &lt;a href=\"weather%20system\"&gt;weather system&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, between 1957 and 1968, Barda\u00ef, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw of rainfall. In general, the range receives less than of rainfall per year. However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example Trou au Natron receives annually. When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow. This occurs, on average, once every seven years.\nThe average monthly maximum temperature is in the central Tibesti Mountains, while the average monthly minimum is . Lows of are not uncommon. Barda\u00ef, located above sea level, experiences average temperatures ranging between in January, between in April, and between in August. The combination of high temperatures and low &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; results in potentially high &lt;a href=\"potential%20evaporation\"&gt;evaporation&lt;/a&gt; rates, ranging from in January to in May, parching many \"enneris\" before they can exit the mountain range.\nFlora and fauna.\nLike an island surrounded by ocean, the &lt;a href=\"ecology\"&gt;ecology&lt;/a&gt; of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert. As such, the mountains lie within their own &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tibesti-Jebel%20Uweinat%20montane%20xeric%20woodlands\"&gt;Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Jebel%20Uweinat\"&gt;Jebel Uweinat&lt;/a&gt;, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara to the east. Much of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of &lt;a href=\"endemic\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; species. Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested. Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and vegetation has suffered from overgrazing in the past.\nFlora.\nThe flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20forests%2C%20woodlands%2C%20and%20scrub\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20Desert%20%28ecoregion%29\"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sahel\"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afromontane\"&gt;Afromontane&lt;/a&gt; vegetation. &lt;a href=\"Biodiversity\"&gt;Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; and endemism levels are higher in the Tibesti than in the &lt;a href=\"A%C3%AFr%20Mountains\"&gt;A\u00efr Mountains&lt;/a&gt; or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall. &lt;a href=\"oasis\"&gt;Oases&lt;/a&gt; lie along the courses of the \"enneris\", such as Enneri Yebige. These oases, which are more numerous to the north and west of the range, are scattered with &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"figs\"&gt;figs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hyphaene\"&gt;palms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tamarisk\"&gt;tamarisk&lt;/a&gt;s. Most gueltas are lined with &lt;a href=\"macrophyte\"&gt;macrophyte&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014including &lt;a href=\"smooth%20flatsedge\"&gt;smooth flatsedge&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cyperus laevigatus\") and &lt;a href=\"branched%20horsetail\"&gt;branched horsetail&lt;/a&gt; (\"Equisetum ramosissimum\")\u2014and &lt;a href=\"bryophyte\"&gt;bryophyte&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014including \"&lt;a href=\"Oxyrrhynchium%20speciosum\"&gt;Oxyrrhynchium speciosum&lt;/a&gt;\" and species of \"&lt;a href=\"Bryum\"&gt;Bryum&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20acacia\"&gt;Egyptian acacia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Vachellia nilotica\" syn. \"Acacia nilotica\") grows near these water basins. &lt;a href=\"Saharan%20myrtle\"&gt;Saharan myrtle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Myrtus nivellei\") and &lt;a href=\"oleander\"&gt;oleander&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nerium oleander\") grow between elevations of in the western part of the range, while &lt;a href=\"Nile%20tamarisk\"&gt;Nile tamarisk&lt;/a&gt; (\"Tamarix nilotica\") grows at similar elevations in its northern part. Downstream, where the current of the \"enneris\" is slower and the riverbed is deeper, there are dense thickets of &lt;a href=\"Athel%20tamarisk\"&gt;Athel tamarisk&lt;/a&gt; (\"Tamarix aphylla\" syn. \"Tamarix articulata\") and &lt;a href=\"Salvadora%20persica\"&gt;arak&lt;/a&gt; (\"Salvadora persica\").\nAround the edge of the Tibesti, where the canyons exit the range, are &lt;a href=\"doum%20palm\"&gt;doum palm&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Hyphaene thebaica\"). The banks of Mare de Zoui are home to dense stands of &lt;a href=\"Reed%20%28plant%29\"&gt;reeds&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Phragmites%20australis\"&gt;Phragmites australis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Typha%20capensis\"&gt;Typha capensis&lt;/a&gt;\"), along with &lt;a href=\"Scirpoides\"&gt;sedges&lt;/a&gt; (\"Scirpoides holoschoenus\"), &lt;a href=\"Juncus%20maritimus\"&gt;sea rush&lt;/a&gt; (\"Juncus maritimus\"), &lt;a href=\"toad%20rush\"&gt;toad rush&lt;/a&gt; (\"Juncus bufonius\") and branched horsetail (\"E. ramosissimum\"), while &lt;a href=\"Potamogeton\"&gt;pondweed&lt;/a&gt; (\"Potamogeton\" spp.) grows in the open water. Although the lake appears rich in &lt;a href=\"phytoplankton\"&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt;, it has not been thoroughly studied. To the south and southwest of the range, between elevation, the wadis support woody species characteristic of the Sahel, such as &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20balsam\"&gt;Egyptian balsam&lt;/a&gt; (\"Balanites aegyptiaca\"), &lt;a href=\"grey-leaved%20cordia\"&gt;grey-leaved cordia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Cordia sinensis\"), &lt;a href=\"red-leaved%20fig\"&gt;red-leaved fig&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ficus ingens\"), &lt;a href=\"sycamore%20fig\"&gt;sycamore fig&lt;/a&gt; (\"F. sycomorus\"), &lt;a href=\"Ficus%20salicifolia\"&gt;wonderboom&lt;/a&gt; (\"F. salicifolia\") and &lt;a href=\"gay%20acacia\"&gt;gay acacia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Senegalia laeta\" syn. \"Acacia laeta\"). \"&lt;a href=\"Chrysopogon%20plumulosus\"&gt;Chrysopogon plumulosus&lt;/a&gt;\" is the most common &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; in the area. Other plants have more Mediterranean characteristics, such as &lt;a href=\"globularia\"&gt;globularia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Globularia alypum\") and &lt;a href=\"lavender\"&gt;lavender&lt;/a&gt; (\"Lavandula pubescens\") or the more tropical &lt;a href=\"sweet%20Indian%20mallow\"&gt;sweet Indian mallow&lt;/a&gt; (\"Abutilon fruticosum\") and &lt;a href=\"least%20snout-bean\"&gt;least snout-bean&lt;/a&gt; (\"Rhynchosia minima\" syn. \"Rhynchosia memnonia\"). The liverwort \"&lt;a href=\"Plagiochasma%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%28plant%29\"&gt;Plagiochasma rupestre&lt;/a&gt;\" is found around the wadis at these elevations, as are &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;es of the genera \"&lt;a href=\"Fissidens\"&gt;Fissidens&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gymnostomum\"&gt;Gymnostomum&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Timmiella\"&gt;Timmiella&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSaharomontane &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt;s are found on the slopes, plateaus and the upper portions of the wadis at elevations between . They are dominated by \"&lt;a href=\"Stipagrostis%20obtusa\"&gt;Stipagrostis obtusa&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Aristida%20caerulescens\"&gt;Aristida caerulescens&lt;/a&gt;\", as well some \"&lt;a href=\"Eragrostis%20papposa\"&gt;Eragrostis papposa&lt;/a&gt;\" locally. In addition, shrubs represented by &lt;a href=\"jointed%20anabis\"&gt;jointed anabis&lt;/a&gt; (\"Anabasis articulata\"), \"&lt;a href=\"Fagonia%20flamandii\"&gt;Fagonia flamandii&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Zilla%20spinosa\"&gt;Zilla spinosa&lt;/a&gt;\" dot this environment. On the sheltered upper slopes of Emi Koussi is the endemic grass \"&lt;a href=\"Eragrostis%20kohorica\"&gt;Eragrostis kohorica&lt;/a&gt;\", named after the volcano's crater.\nThe vegetation above consists of dwarf shrubs, which are generally limited to in height and do not exceed . The shrubbery consists of the species \"&lt;a href=\"Pentzia%20monodiana\"&gt;Pentzia monodiana&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Artemisia%20tilhoana\"&gt;Artemisia tilhoana&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ephedra%20tilhoana\"&gt;Ephedra tilhoana&lt;/a&gt;\". At the highest elevations of the Tibesti, &lt;a href=\"Erica%20arborea\"&gt;tree heath&lt;/a&gt; (\"Erica arborea\") grows from moist crevices formed by early lava flows, while 24 different species of moss provide substrate for the tree heath. Various genera of mosses also grow around fumaroles, including \"Fissidens\", \"&lt;a href=\"Campylopus\"&gt;Campylopus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Gymnostomum\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Trichostomum\"&gt;Trichostomum&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Lichen\"&gt;Lichen&lt;/a&gt;s, though rare in the dry climate of the Tibesti, also grow at these elevations, with &lt;a href=\"green%20rock%20shield\"&gt;green rock shield&lt;/a&gt; (\"Xanthoparmelia conspersa\"), &lt;a href=\"scrambled-egg%20lichen\"&gt;scrambled-egg lichen&lt;/a&gt; (\"Fulgensia fulgens\"), &lt;a href=\"sunken%20disk%20lichen\"&gt;sunken disk lichen&lt;/a&gt; (\"Aspicilia\" spp.) and \"&lt;a href=\"Squamarina\"&gt;Squamarina crassa&lt;/a&gt;\" found on the highest peaks.\nFauna.\n&lt;a href=\"Mammals\"&gt;Mammals&lt;/a&gt; abound in the Tibesti. &lt;a href=\"Bovid\"&gt;Bovid&lt;/a&gt;s include the endangered &lt;a href=\"addax\"&gt;addax&lt;/a&gt; (\"Addax nasomaculatus\") along with the &lt;a href=\"dorcas%20gazelle\"&gt;dorcas gazelle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gazella dorcas\"), &lt;a href=\"rhim%20gazelle\"&gt;rhim gazelle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gazella leptoceros\") and a significant population of &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20sheep\"&gt;Barbary sheep&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ammotragus lervia\"). &lt;a href=\"Rodent\"&gt;Rodent&lt;/a&gt;s are the most represented &lt;a href=\"order%20%28biology%29\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; of mammals, and include the &lt;a href=\"spiny%20mouse\"&gt;spiny mouse&lt;/a&gt; (\"Acomys\" spp.), &lt;a href=\"bushy-tailed%20jird\"&gt;bushy-tailed jird&lt;/a&gt; (\"Sekeetamys calurus\") and the &lt;a href=\"North%20African%20gerbil\"&gt;North African gerbil&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dipodillus campestris\" syn. \"Gerbillus campestris\"). Also present are &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"African%20wildcat\"&gt;African wildcat&lt;/a&gt; (\"Felis lybica\") and, more rarely, the &lt;a href=\"cheetah\"&gt;cheetah&lt;/a&gt; (\"Acinonyx jubatus\"), as well as several &lt;a href=\"canis\"&gt;canine&lt;/a&gt; species, including the &lt;a href=\"golden%20jackal\"&gt;golden jackal&lt;/a&gt; (\"Canis aureus\"), &lt;a href=\"fennec%20fox\"&gt;fennec fox&lt;/a&gt; (\"Vulpes zerda\") and &lt;a href=\"R%C3%BCppell%27s%20fox\"&gt;R\u00fcppell's fox&lt;/a&gt; (\"Vulpes rueppellii\"). The &lt;a href=\"striped%20hyena\"&gt;striped hyena&lt;/a&gt; (\"Hyaena hyaena\") may also occupy the range. &lt;a href=\"African%20wild%20dog\"&gt;African wild dog&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Lycaon pictus\") formerly roamed the range, although these populations are now &lt;a href=\"Local%20extinction\"&gt;extirpated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Olive%20baboon\"&gt;Olive baboon&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Papio anubis\"), found as recently as 1960, are now likely extirpated as well. &lt;a href=\"Bat\"&gt;Bat&lt;/a&gt;s are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20mouse-tailed%20bat\"&gt;Egyptian mouse-tailed bat&lt;/a&gt; (\"Rhinopoma cystops\"), &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20slit-faced%20bat\"&gt;Egyptian slit-faced bat&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nycteris thebaica\") and the &lt;a href=\"trident%20bat\"&gt;trident bat&lt;/a&gt; (\"Asellia tridens\"). The &lt;a href=\"Cape%20hare\"&gt;Cape hare&lt;/a&gt; (\"Lepus capensis\") and the &lt;a href=\"rock%20hyrax\"&gt;rock hyrax&lt;/a&gt; (\"Procavia capensis\") also populate the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Reptile\"&gt;Reptile&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s, on the other hand, are sparse. &lt;a href=\"Snake\"&gt;Snake&lt;/a&gt; species include the &lt;a href=\"Coluber%20rhodorachis\"&gt;braid snake&lt;/a&gt; (\"Platyceps rhodorachis\" syn. \"Coluber rhodorachis\") and the &lt;a href=\"Myriopholis%20macrorhyncha\"&gt;long-nosed worm snake&lt;/a&gt; (\"Myriopholis macrorhyncha\" syn. \"Leptotyphlops macrorhynchus\"). Among the &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"Bibron%27s%20agama\"&gt;Bibron's agama&lt;/a&gt; (\"Agama impalearis\"), the &lt;a href=\"ringed%20wall%20gecko\"&gt;ringed wall gecko&lt;/a&gt; (\"Tarentola annularis\") and the &lt;a href=\"Uromastyx\"&gt;Sudan mastigure&lt;/a&gt; (\"Uromastyx dispar\"). Mid-20th-century &lt;a href=\"herpetological\"&gt;herpetological&lt;/a&gt; studies noted the presence of &lt;a href=\"brown%20frogs\"&gt;brown frogs&lt;/a&gt; (\"Rana\" sp.) and &lt;a href=\"Bufo\"&gt;true toads&lt;/a&gt; (\"Bufo\" sp.).\nMany resident &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in the Tibesti. These include the &lt;a href=\"crowned%20sandgrouse\"&gt;crowned sandgrouse&lt;/a&gt; (\"Pterocles coronatus\"), &lt;a href=\"bar-tailed%20lark\"&gt;bar-tailed lark&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ammomanes cincturus\"), &lt;a href=\"blackstart\"&gt;blackstart&lt;/a&gt; (\"Oenanthe melanura\" syn. \"Cercomela melanura\"), &lt;a href=\"desert%20lark\"&gt;desert lark&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ammomanes deserti\"), &lt;a href=\"desert%20sparrow\"&gt;desert sparrow&lt;/a&gt; (\"Passer simplex\"), &lt;a href=\"fulvous%20babbler\"&gt;fulvous babbler&lt;/a&gt; (\"Argya fulva\"), &lt;a href=\"greater%20hoopoe-lark\"&gt;greater hoopoe-lark&lt;/a&gt; (\"Alaemon alaudipes\"), &lt;a href=\"Lichtenstein%27s%20sandgrouse\"&gt;Lichtenstein's sandgrouse&lt;/a&gt; (\"Pterocles lichtensteinii\"), &lt;a href=\"pale%20crag%20martin\"&gt;pale crag martin&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ptyonoprogne obsoleta\"), &lt;a href=\"trumpeter%20finch\"&gt;trumpeter finch&lt;/a&gt; (\"Bucanetes githagineus\") and the &lt;a href=\"white-crowned%20wheatear\"&gt;white-crowned wheatear&lt;/a&gt; (\"Oenanthe leucopyga\").\nThe gueltas are flushed periodically each year by stormwater, maintaining low &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt; and supporting several species of &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20fish\"&gt;freshwater fish&lt;/a&gt;. These include the &lt;a href=\"African%20sharptooth%20catfish\"&gt;African sharptooth catfish&lt;/a&gt; (\"Clarias gariepinus\"), &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20red-finned%20barb\"&gt;East African red-finned barb&lt;/a&gt; (\"Enteromius apleurogramma\" syn. \"Barbus apleurogramma\"), Tibesti &lt;a href=\"labeo\"&gt;labeo&lt;/a&gt; (\"Labeo tibestii\", an endemic species) and the &lt;a href=\"redbelly%20tilapia\"&gt;redbelly tilapia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Coptodon zillii\").\nPopulation.\nThe town of Barda\u00ef, located on the northern flank of the mountains at an elevation of , is the capital of the Tibesti region. It is connected to the town of Zouar, to the southwest, by a track that crosses Tarso Toussid\u00e9. The village of Omchi is accessible from Barda\u00ef via Aderk\u00e9, or from the town of Aouzou via Irbi. These rough tracks extend southward towards Yebbi Souma and Yebbi Bou, and then follow the course of Enneri Misky. The eastern half of the Tibesti is cut off from the western half, and the eastern village of Aozi is accessible from Libya via Ouri. Zouar has an &lt;a href=\"Zouar%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, as does Barda\u00ef at &lt;a href=\"Zougra%20Airport\"&gt;Zougra&lt;/a&gt;. Barda\u00ef also has a hospital, although the medical supply is very much dependent upon the prevailing political situation.\nThe vast majority of the population is &lt;a href=\"Teda%20people\"&gt;Teda&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two ethnicities of the Toubou people. However, some clans are Daza, the other Toubou ethnicity, who left their traditional homes in the lowlands to the south and moved north to the Tibesti. The Toubou live primarily in northern Chad, but also in southern Libya and eastern Niger. The &lt;a href=\"Tebu%20language\"&gt;Toubou language&lt;/a&gt; has two main dialects, Tedaga, spoken by the Teda, and Dazaga, spoken by the Daza. Despite their differences, the two Toubou groups generally identify as a single ethnic group. The Toubou elect a chief, the \"&lt;a href=\"Derd%C3%A9\"&gt;Derd\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\", from the Tomagra clan, although never from the same family consecutively. Historically, individual clans rarely had more than a thousand members and were quite dispersed throughout the Tibesti. the population of the Tibesti was officially estimated at 21,000 inhabitants. that number has risen to 54,000 inhabitants. Yet the Toubou, in general, are semi-nomadic, moving between the mountains and other regions, and thus the Tibesti may have no more than 10,000 to 15,000 permanent residents.\nTraditional Toubou life is punctuated by the seasons, divided between &lt;a href=\"animal%20husbandry\"&gt;animal husbandry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Twentieth-century &lt;a href=\"anthropological\"&gt;anthropological&lt;/a&gt; studies show Toubou, particularly around palm groves, living in primitive round huts built with stone walls bound by &lt;a href=\"mortar%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt; or clay, or built from clay or &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; blocks. In the highlands, the buildings were built of stone, forming circles in diameter and high, which served as shelters for goats, or as granaries, or as human shelters and defense structures. In other cases, the Toubou lived in tents that could be easily moved between the fields and the palm groves.\nHistory.\nHuman settlement.\nThere is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Age\"&gt;Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;, when denser paleovegetation facilitated human habitation. The Toubou were settled in the region by the 5th century BC and eventually established trade relations with the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Carthage\"&gt;Carthaginian&lt;/a&gt; civilization. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt; mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled \"&lt;a href=\"Aethiopia\"&gt;Aethiopia&lt;/a&gt;ns\", and described them as having a language akin to the \"cry of bats\".\nHerodotus further remarked on a conflict between the Toubou and the civilization of &lt;a href=\"Garamantes\"&gt;Garamantes&lt;/a&gt; based in present-day Libya. Between AD 83 and 92, a Roman traveler, likely a trader, named &lt;a href=\"Romans%20in%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;Julius Maternus&lt;/a&gt;, explored the territory of the Tibesti Mountains with, or under the charge of, the king of Garamantes. The Tibesti are suspected by modern historians to have been part of an unidentified country named &lt;a href=\"Agisymba\"&gt;Agisymba&lt;/a&gt;, and Maternus's expedition may have been part of a broader military campaign by Garamantes against the populace of Agisymba.\nIn the 12th century, the geographer &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20al-Idrisi\"&gt;Muhammad al-Idrisi&lt;/a&gt; spoke of a \"country of &lt;a href=\"Zaghawa%20people\"&gt;Zaghawa&lt;/a&gt; negroes\", or camel herders, that had converted to &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. The historian &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Khaldun\"&gt;Ibn Khaldun&lt;/a&gt; described the Toubou in the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, &lt;a href=\"Al-Maqrizi\"&gt;Al-Maqrizi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Africanus\"&gt;Leo Africanus&lt;/a&gt; referred to the \"country of the Berdoa\", meaning Barda\u00ef, the former associating the Toubou with the &lt;a href=\"Berbers\"&gt;Berbers&lt;/a&gt; and the latter describing them as &lt;a href=\"Numidia\"&gt;Numidia&lt;/a&gt;n relatives of the &lt;a href=\"Tuareg%20people\"&gt;Tuareg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Toubou settled in the Tibesti in several waves. Generally, newcomers either killed or absorbed the previous clans after battles that were often both long-lasting and bloody. The Teda clans, considered indigenous to the area, were first established around Enneri Bardagu\u00e9. Namely, these clans were the Cerdegua, Zouia, Kossseda (nicknamed \"yobat\" or \"hunters of well water\"), and possibly the Ederguia, although the Ederguia's origin may be Zaghawa and only go back to the 17th century. These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced \"&lt;a href=\"Ghazw\"&gt;Ghazw&lt;/a&gt;\". It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derd\u00e9, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan.\nThere is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans\u2014the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina\u2014were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries, possibly having fled the &lt;a href=\"Kanem-Bornu%20Empire\"&gt;Kanem-Bornu Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest. These later Daza arrivals include the Arna Souinga in the south, Gouboda in the center-west, Tchioda and Dirsina in the west, Torama in the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, \"descendants of the chief,\" the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north. The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers. Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities. Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided with more or less pronounced wet and dry periods.\nSeveral clans with traditions similar to those of the Donzas of the Borkou region, south of the Tibesti, settled in the range in the 16th and 17th centuries. These include the Keressa and Odobaya in the west, Foctoa in the northwest and northeast, and Emmeouia in the north. Several other clans\u2014the Mogode in the west, Terintere in the north, Tozoba in the center, and Tegua and Mada in the south\u2014are originally clans of the &lt;a href=\"Bidayat%20dialect\"&gt;Bideyat&lt;/a&gt; people who immigrated from the Ennedi Plateau, southeast of Tibesti, around the same time. The Mada, however, have since largely emigrated to Borkou, &lt;a href=\"Kaouar\"&gt;Kaouar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanem%20Region\"&gt;Kanem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe early 17th century also saw the arrival of three clans from the region of &lt;a href=\"Kufra\"&gt;Kufra&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast. The Ta\u00efzera settled in the plateau in the center and west of the mass, probably fleeing the &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; push into present-day Libya. According to &lt;a href=\"oral%20tradition\"&gt;oral tradition&lt;/a&gt;, their leader was initially rejected by the Daza clans and lived in isolation until winning the favor of a Dirsina woman. The Mahadena occupy the northeast quarter of the range and are likely from the &lt;a href=\"Jalo%20oasis\"&gt;Jalo oasis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrenaica\"&gt;Cyrenaica&lt;/a&gt; and thus related to the Mogharba Arab tribes, although an alternative hypothesis is that they are of Bideyat origin. Following years of conflict, a branch of the Mahadena clan, the Fortena, withdrew to the western margin of the Tibesti. The Fortena Mado (\"Red Fortena\") settled there, while the Fortena Yasko (\"Black Fortena\") pushed further west to Kaouar.\nThe Tuareg people intermixed with the Toubou clans, especially with the early Goga clan, which produced the Gouboda, and with the later Arna clan, which produced the Mormorea. In both instances, the new clans were placed under the authority of &lt;a href=\"suzerain\"&gt;suzerain&lt;/a&gt; clans of the traditionally &lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; Tuareg, although they were eventually assimilated into the Toubou majority.\nRegional relations and colonization.\nIn the mid-19th century the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; began a campaign of territorial conquest across northern Africa from its regional headquarters in Libya, yet was unable to subdue the Tibesti. In 1890, to the chagrin of the Turks, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; signed a declaration recognizing a French zone of influence in northern Africa from the Mediterranean Sea down to Lake Chad. In response, the Toubou allied with the &lt;a href=\"Senussi\"&gt;Senussi&lt;/a&gt; Arabs of Libya and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the &lt;a href=\"French%20Colonial%20Army\"&gt;French Colonial Army&lt;/a&gt;. As the Sennussis' influence moved southward, so did their headquarters, which in 1899 was moved to the town of &lt;a href=\"Gouro%2C%20Chad\"&gt;Gouro&lt;/a&gt; on the southeast flank of the range. The Senussi founded a &lt;a href=\"Zawiya%20%28institution%29\"&gt;Zawiya&lt;/a&gt; in Barda\u00ef, which quickly promoted the total &lt;a href=\"Islamization\"&gt;Islamization&lt;/a&gt; of the Tibesti. At the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Italo-Turkish%20War\"&gt;Italo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;, the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derd\u00e9, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911. These garrisons fell apart a few months later when the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; occupied the &lt;a href=\"Fezzan\"&gt;Fezzan&lt;/a&gt;, a French &lt;a href=\"Column%20%28formation%29\"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; entered the Tibesti in early 1914 from Kaouar. The region was at the heart of a dispute between the colonial powers, with the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Empire\"&gt;Italian Empire&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"French%20West%20Africa\"&gt;French West Africa&lt;/a&gt; to the south. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, a Senussi revolt forced the Italians to temporarily withdraw from the Fezzan and the northeastern part of the Tibesti. Likewise, fierce resistance from the Toubou forced the French troops to retreat southward from the Tibesti in 1916. After a period of internal disorder, the Tibesti was reconquered by the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1929, and the region was placed under the administration of &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Libya gained its independence from Italy in 1947, and was released from British and French oversight in 1951.\nModern history.\nChadian Civil War.\nChad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Tombalbaye\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye&lt;/a&gt; imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti. Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Barda\u00ef, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Barda\u00ef in September. In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the &lt;a href=\"Toubou\"&gt;Toubou&lt;/a&gt; and voided the traditional power of the then Derd\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Oueddei%20Kichidemi\"&gt;Oueddei Kichidemi&lt;/a&gt;. Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government. These events sparked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Chadian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;First Chadian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted from 1965 to 1979.\nIn 1968, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Army\"&gt;French Army&lt;/a&gt;, at the request of Tombalbaye, intervened in an attempt to put an end to the rebellion. However, French General Edouard Cortadellas admitted their attempts to quell the Toubou were essentially hopeless, remarking, \"I believe we should draw a line below [the Tibesti region] and leave them to their stones. We can never subdue them.\" The French therefore focused their intervention on the center and east of the country, leaving the Tibesti region largely alone.\nIn 1969, &lt;a href=\"Goukouni%20Oueddei\"&gt;Goukouni Oueddei&lt;/a&gt;, a Teda leader, and &lt;a href=\"Hiss%C3%A8ne%20Habr%C3%A9\"&gt;Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, a Daza leader, emerged from the Tibesti to form the Second Liberation Army. In April 1974, the Second Liberation Army captured Barda\u00ef from the Chadian government and took hostage the French archeologist &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7oise%20Claustre\"&gt;Fran\u00e7oise Claustre&lt;/a&gt;, German doctor &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20Staewen\"&gt;Christophe Staewen&lt;/a&gt; and Marc Combe, an assistant to Claustre's husband, and held them in the mountains. Staewen's wife and two soldiers of the Chadian army were killed. The &lt;a href=\"West%20German\"&gt;West German&lt;/a&gt; government quickly paid the ransom and Staewen was released. The French government sent the military officer &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Galopin\"&gt;Pierre Galopin&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate with the rebels, but he was captured by the rebels and executed in April 1975. Marc Combe was able to escape in May 1975. The remaining hostages were released in January 1977 in Tripoli after France acceded to the rebel's ransom demand. The hostage incident, known as \"L'affaire Claustre\", caused a rift between the French and Chadian governments.\nAnother rift formed between Goukouni and Habr\u00e9, which by 1976 had spread to the Second Liberation Army, leaving one side commanded by Habr\u00e9 and the other commanded by Goukouni and supported by Libya. In June 1977, Goukouni's forces attacked the Chadian government stronghold in Barda\u00ef. The rebels also attacked Zouar. These battles resulted in the death of 300 government troops. Barda\u00ef surrendered to the rebels on July 4, while Zouar was evacuated. The Chadian government, led by &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20Malloum\"&gt;F\u00e9lix Malloum&lt;/a&gt; since Tombalbaye's overthrow in 1975, signed a peace agreement with Habr\u00e9 in 1978, although fighting with other rebel groups, many aligned with Libya, continued.\nTibesti War.\nIn 1978, war broke out between Chad and Libya ostensibly over the &lt;a href=\"Aouzou%20Strip\"&gt;Aouzou Strip&lt;/a&gt;, a borderland between Chad and Libya that extends into the Tibesti Mountains and is rumored to contain &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; deposits. In 1980, Libya used the strip as a base from which stage an attack, led by Goukouni, on the Chadian capital, &lt;a href=\"N%27Djamena\"&gt;N'Djamena&lt;/a&gt;, located in southern Chad and controlled by Habr\u00e9. N'Djamena was toppled in December; however, under considerable international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habr\u00e9's &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Forces%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Armed Forces of the North&lt;/a&gt; (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed &lt;a href=\"Transitional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity\"&gt;Government of National Unity&lt;/a&gt; (GUNT) forces. Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Barda\u00ef and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad. Habr\u00e9 attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions. Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces.\nBy 1986, following a series of military defeats, the GUNT had begun to disintegrate along with relations between Goukouni and Libya. In December, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, which spurred his troops to attack Libyan positions in the Tibesti, forcing the Libyans to withdraw. Libya sought to retake Barda\u00ef and Zouar, and sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with &lt;a href=\"T-62\"&gt;T-62&lt;/a&gt; tanks and heavy support by the &lt;a href=\"Libyan%20Air%20Force%20%281951-2011%29\"&gt;Libyan Air Force&lt;/a&gt; into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds. The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habr\u00e9, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces. Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the broader campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity never before seen in Chad. After a &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20War\"&gt;series of defeats&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern Chad, Libyan forces withdrew fully from the Tibesti in March 1987.\nMDJT War.\nFollowing a decade of relative peace, in late 1997 the Tibesti saw the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Justice%20in%20Chad\"&gt;Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad&lt;/a&gt; (MDJT), a rebel group opposed to Chadian president &lt;a href=\"Idriss%20D%C3%A9by\"&gt;Idriss D\u00e9by&lt;/a&gt;. Numbering around 1,000 fighters at its peak between 2000 and 2001, and financed by Libyan Teda clans and the Libyan government, the MDJT was able to take control of several towns in the Tibesti. Battles with the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Chad\"&gt;Chadian National Army&lt;/a&gt; (ANT) were particularly violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Barda\u00ef. Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population.\nBetween 1998 and 2010 the MDJT had established a weak government in the Tibesti region, functionally independent from that of Chad. In 2002, however, weakened by its isolation in the Tibesti and from a series of military defeats, the MDJT split into several factions following the death of its leader, &lt;a href=\"Youssouf%20Togo%C3%AFmi\"&gt;Youssouf Togo\u00efmi&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, under pressure from Libya, the \"most legitimate\" MDJT faction signed a peace agreement with the Chadian government, yet the war continued, albeit at a lower intensity. From 2009 to 2010, the last of the MDJT rebels surrendered to the Chadian government. The legacy of decades of war continues to burden the Tibesti with a lack of government, a warrior culture, and a landscape strewn with thousands of landmines.\nGold rush.\nGold was discovered in the Tibesti Mountains in 2012, attracting prospectors from across the &lt;a href=\"Sahel\"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of migrants has led to violent conflicts with the Teda locals, a problem exacerbated by an influx of weaponry to the region due to the wars in &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Darfur\"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Libyan%20Crisis%20%282011%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. Migration has also increased &lt;a href=\"drug%20traffic\"&gt;drug traffic&lt;/a&gt;, with the Tibesti lying along the trans-Saharan smuggling route for South American &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; destined for Europe. Nevertheless, the gold discovery has benefited the impoverished region economically. Many Tibesti residents have been able to purchase goods such as cars, televisions and satellite telephones that they could not otherwise afford. \"If by the grace of God, gold had not appeared we would not even have anything to eat\", remarked one Tibesti prospector.\nScientific exploration and research.\nDue to its isolation and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists. The German &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Nachtigal\"&gt;Gustav Nachtigal&lt;/a&gt; was the first European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869. While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his expedition was fiercely opposed by the Toubou, and his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years. Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"petrology\"&gt;petrology&lt;/a&gt; of the range. The French &lt;a href=\"anthropologist\"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt; Charles le C\u0153ur and his wife Marguerite, a &lt;a href=\"geographer\"&gt;geographer&lt;/a&gt;, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935. Le C\u0153ur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; prevented him from publishing his research. French Colonel &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Chapelle\"&gt;Jean Chapelle&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href=\"%23\"&gt;a book on the Toubou&lt;/a&gt; and their lifestyle in 1957. In 1965, the &lt;a href=\"Free%20University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Free University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; opened a &lt;a href=\"geomorphological\"&gt;geomorphological&lt;/a&gt; research station in Barda\u00ef; however, research was slowed due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974.\nAlthough the Tibesti is one of the world's most significant examples of intracontinental volcanism, ongoing political instability and the presence of landmines means that, today, geologic research often must be conducted on the basis of satellite images and comparison with research on Martian volcanoes. Little public geologic research had been conducted in the Tibesti Mountains until the work of &lt;a href=\"%23\"&gt;Gourgaud and Vincent in 2004&lt;/a&gt;; however, an expedition in 2015 sought to assess the feasibility of establishing a new &lt;a href=\"geoscience\"&gt;geoscience&lt;/a&gt; research station in Barda\u00ef.\nClimbing history.\nAlthough not an alpine climb, Gustav Nachtigal ascended to elevation as he traversed a &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20pass\"&gt;pass&lt;/a&gt; abutting &lt;a href=\"Pic%20Toussid%C3%A9\"&gt;Pic Toussid\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; during his exploration of the Tibesti in 1869. The Englishman &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Thesiger\"&gt;Wilfred Thesiger&lt;/a&gt; summited the highest mountain in the range, the &lt;a href=\"Emi%20Koussi\"&gt;Emi Koussi&lt;/a&gt;, in 1938. In 1948, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research mounted an expedition under &lt;a href=\"Edouard%20Wyss-Dunant\"&gt;Edouard Wyss-Dunant&lt;/a&gt;, which scaled both the peak and needle of Botoum, at and , respectively.\nIn 1957, Peter Steele led a &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; expedition that sought to conquer Tarso Tieroko, which Thesiger had described as \"probably the most beautiful peak in Tibesti\". After climbing two peaks situated on a ridge to the north, they attempted Tieroko, but just from the summit, they were faced with a vertical, crumbling rock wall and were forced to descend. Following this defeat, they took the opportunity to climb Emi Koussi, 19 years after its first ascent by Thesiger, and also Pic Woubou, a prominent spire located between Barda\u00ef and Aouzou. Seven years later, in 1965, a team led by the Englishman &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Scott\"&gt;Doug Scott&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in climbing Tieroko.\nIn 1963, an expedition under the Italian &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Monzino\"&gt;Guido Monzino&lt;/a&gt; ascended a peak in the massif of the Aiguilles of Siss\u00e9 which, despite rising only above ground level, proved \"very difficult\". The Englishman &lt;a href=\"Eamon%20Ginge%20Fullen\"&gt;Eamon \"Ginge\" Fullen&lt;/a&gt; scaled &lt;a href=\"Bikku%20Bitti\"&gt;Bikku Bitti&lt;/a&gt;, the highest peak in Libya at , in 2005, capping a successful \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20World%20Records\"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;\" attempt. Due to the unstable political situation, mountaineering in the Tibesti remains a challenging endeavor today.\nEconomy.\nNatural resources.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012. &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found. The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tin\"&gt;tin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tungsten\"&gt;tungsten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"niobium\"&gt;niobium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tantalum\"&gt;tantalum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beryllium\"&gt;beryllium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Amazonite\"&gt;Amazonite&lt;/a&gt; is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes. &lt;a href=\"Salt\"&gt;Salt&lt;/a&gt; is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou.\nThe Soborom geothermal field, the name of which means \"healing water\", is known to locals for its medicinal qualities; its pools are rumored to cure &lt;a href=\"dermatitis\"&gt;dermatitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatism&lt;/a&gt; after several days of soaking. Mare de Zoui and its surroundings were rarely visited, aside from a nearby oasis. However, there are numerous small oases on the plains of Borkou, near Emi Koussi, which are extensively exploited. This water is thought to be sourced sourced from the Tibesti Mountains, from where it flows underground before surfacing at these springs.\nAgriculture.\nThere are accessible &lt;a href=\"oases\"&gt;oases&lt;/a&gt; to the west and north of the range. Where &lt;a href=\"mosquito\"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt;es do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar where, by the 1950s, indigenous plant species had been largely replaced by some 56,000 &lt;a href=\"date%20palm\"&gt;date palm&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Phoenix dactylifera\"). The dates are harvested between late July and early August. In winter, when reserves are depleted, it is not uncommon for the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed. Some native palm species remain, such as the &lt;a href=\"doum%20palm\"&gt;doum palm&lt;/a&gt; (\"Hyphaene thebaica\"), from which the hard yet vaguely-sweet &lt;a href=\"Peel%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;fruit rinds&lt;/a&gt; are collected, ground and consumed, despite their low nutritional value. The banks of the \"enneris\" grow &lt;a href=\"desert%20gourd\"&gt;desert gourd&lt;/a&gt; (\"Citrullus colocynthis\"), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make &lt;a href=\"flour\"&gt;flour&lt;/a&gt;. Women are customarily responsible for gathering wild grains on the \"tarsos\" in August.\n&lt;a href=\"Horticulture\"&gt;Horticulture&lt;/a&gt; is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods. The palm groves can also grow &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;, but the crops are spotty and sometimes swept away by flooding. in total, including &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;, the Tibesti produced of &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt;s each year. On the plains of Borkou, some fields are irrigated, where &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dromedaries\"&gt;dromedaries&lt;/a&gt; can drink. In the 1950s, it was reported that goats and, more rarely, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; numbered 50,000 heads, while 8,000 dromedaries and 7,000 &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s were being raised in the range. Since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, dromedaries have come to dominate at the expense of cattle. Most animals spend the winter on the plateaus or in the high valleys. They descend into the lower valleys in February, just after the sowing of wheat, and then return in June to allow harvest. Fishing is possible in the water holes. Traditionally, agricultural product was traded once a year in exchange for fabrics.\nTourism.\nAs the Sahara's highest mountain range, with geothermal features, a distinctive culture, and numerous rock and parietal artworks, the Tibesti has tourism potential. However, tourist accommodations are limited at best. In the early 2010s, the French &lt;a href=\"adventure%20travel\"&gt;adventure travel&lt;/a&gt; company Point-Afrique financed the repair of the &lt;a href=\"Faya-Largeau%20Airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Faya-Largeau\"&gt;Faya-Largeau&lt;/a&gt;, some southeast of the Tibesti, and established direct &lt;a href=\"charter%20flight\"&gt;charter flight&lt;/a&gt;s between Faya and &lt;a href=\"Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;. Although the flights mainly brought tourists destined for the &lt;a href=\"Lakes%20of%20Ounianga\"&gt;Ounianga Lakes UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, there was considerable hope that they would also open the gates for tourism in the Tibesti. For example, the Chadian government invested in a tourist camp along with walled &lt;a href=\"pavilion\"&gt;pavilion&lt;/a&gt;s in Barda\u00ef. Yet, following the Libyan Crisis and &lt;a href=\"Mali%20War\"&gt;France's intervention in Mali&lt;/a&gt;, the French government pressured tour operators to prevent French tourists from venturing into the Sahara, and the flights ended.\n there are essentially only two tour operators in Chad, run by Chadians and Italians and both based in N'Djamena, which offer all the tours that exist in Chad, including trips to the Tibesti. Tours are typically multi-week affairs, with tourists accommodated in &lt;a href=\"camping\"&gt;tents&lt;/a&gt;. They include exposure to Toubou cultural traditions and to the Tibesti's rock and parietal art. Continuing civil unrest and the presence of landmines pose a danger to tourists, and, despite the occasional tour group, the Tibesti remains one of the most isolated places on Earth.\nConservation.\nThe resources available for &lt;a href=\"Nature%20conservation\"&gt;conservation&lt;/a&gt; in the Tibesti are limited. In 2006, various non-governmental working groups proposed a protected area to preserve the area's rhim gazelle and Barbary sheep populations. The protected area would be modeled after the &lt;a href=\"Ouadi%20Rim%C3%A9-Ouadi%20Achim%20Faunal%20Reserve\"&gt;Ouadi Rim\u00e9-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; to the south. However, due to economic and political barriers, the project has not moved beyond the proposal stage. Nevertheless, the establishment of two &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;s in northern Chad in 2012 and 2016 has renewed hope that a similar feat might be achieved in the Tibesti.\nArt and literature.\nRock and parietal art.\nThe Tibesti Mountains are renowned for their &lt;a href=\"rock%20art\"&gt;rock and parietal art&lt;/a&gt;. Around 200 engraving sites and 100 painting sites have been identified. Many date as early as the 6th millennium BC, long before the arrival of the Toubou. The art has suffered the effects of time, including weathering from sand blown by the wind. The earliest works often portray animals that have since died out in the region due to &lt;a href=\"Climate%20variability%20and%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"elephant\"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hippopotamus\"&gt;hippopotamus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt;s. More recent art includes &lt;a href=\"ostrich\"&gt;ostrich&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"antelope\"&gt;antelope&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gazelle\"&gt;gazelle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"baboon\"&gt;baboon&lt;/a&gt;s and sheep. Later works, dated less than 2000 years old, portray domesticated animals, such as &lt;a href=\"oxen\"&gt;oxen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther engravings portray warriors dressed in feathers or spiked ornaments and armed with bows, shields, &lt;a href=\"assegai\"&gt;assegai&lt;/a&gt;, or traditional knives. Still others portray celebrations and scenes from everyday life. The walls of a canyon near Barda\u00ef have engravings that measure over in height, including that of the \"man of Gonoa\", Gonoa being the name of the \"enneri\" that runs through the valley. These primarily show hunting scenes. The Tibesti art is unique in the Sahara because of the absence of inscriptions, the relative lack of &lt;a href=\"chariots\"&gt;chariots&lt;/a&gt;, and the low representation of &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s until comparatively recently.\nOther works.\nThe Tibesti Mountains have inspired several contemporary works of art and literature. The volcanic spires of the Tibesti, along with a stylized sheep's head, were displayed on a 20 &lt;a href=\"CFA%20franc\"&gt;CFA franc&lt;/a&gt; postage stamp issued by Republic of Chad in 1962. In 1989, French painter and sculptor Jean V\u00e9rame used the natural surroundings of the Tibesti to create multidimensional &lt;a href=\"land%20art\"&gt;land art&lt;/a&gt; works by painting rocks.\nThe Tibesti range was featured in the 1958 short story \"&lt;a href=\"Sessanta%20racconti\"&gt;Le Mura di Anagoor&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Walls of Anagoor\") by the Italian novelist &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Buzzati\"&gt;Dino Buzzati&lt;/a&gt;. In the story, a local guide offers to show a traveler the walls of a great city that is absent from the maps. The city is exceedingly opulent, yet exists in total &lt;a href=\"autarky\"&gt;autarky&lt;/a&gt; and does not submit to local authority. The traveler waits many years, in vain, to enter the Tibesti city."
