In 1946 the &lt;a href=\"Basil%20Goulandris\"&gt;Goulandris brothers&lt;/a&gt; bought her for their &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Line\"&gt;Greek Line&lt;/a&gt; and registered her in &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;. In 1949 she was renamed Columbia\".\nIn Australian civilian service \"Katoomba\" mostly worked scheduled coastal routes, initially between &lt;a href=\"Port%20Jackson\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fremantle%20Harbour\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;. For Greek Line she mostly worked &lt;a href=\"Transatlantic%20crossing\"&gt;transatlantic&lt;/a&gt; routes between Europe and North America, and her passengers included European emigrants. Between 1947 and 1949 &lt;a href=\"Compagnie%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20Transatlantique\"&gt;Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique&lt;/a&gt; (CGT) &lt;a href=\"Chartering%20%28shipping%29\"&gt;chartered&lt;/a&gt; her for service between &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"French%20West%20Indies\"&gt;French West Indies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ship was refitted in 1920, 1946 and 1949. She was a coal-burner until her 1949 refit, when she was converted to burn oil. \"Columbia\" was damaged by fires in 1952 and 1957 and a collision in 1956. She was laid up from 1957 and scrapped in 1959.\nBuilding.\n&lt;a href=\"Harland%20%26amp%3B%20Wolff\"&gt;Harland &amp; Wolff&lt;/a&gt; built \"Katoomba\" on slipway number 6 of its &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; shipyard. Her &lt;a href=\"yard%20number\"&gt;yard number&lt;/a&gt; was 437. She was launched in 10 April 1913 and delivered to McIlwraith, McEacharn &amp; Co on 10 July.\nHer &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;length overall&lt;/a&gt; was , her registered length was , her &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; was and her depth was .

She had four cargo holds, and they included of &lt;a href=\"Reefer%20ship\"&gt;refrigerated&lt;/a&gt; space for perishable goods. In her forepart she had space to carry livestock.\n\"Katoomba\" was propelled by what was called \"combination machinery\". She had three &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;screws&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of four-cylinder &lt;a href=\"Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engines&lt;/a&gt; and a single low-pressure &lt;a href=\"Steam%20turbine%23Marine%20propulsion\"&gt;steam turbine&lt;/a&gt;. The reciprocating engines drove her &lt;a href=\"port%20and%20starboard\"&gt;port and starboard&lt;/a&gt; screws. Exhaust steam from their low-pressure cylinders powered the turbine, which drove her middle screw. Between them the three engines gave her a service speed of .\nMcIlwraith, McEacharn registered \"Katoomba\" in &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

She was equipped for &lt;a href=\"wireless%20telegraphy\"&gt;wireless telegraphy&lt;/a&gt;, operated by the &lt;a href=\"Marconi%20Company\"&gt;Marconi Company&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1933 her &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20call%20sign\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt; was VHN.\nEarly civilian service.\nMcIlwraith, McEacharn's senior &lt;a href=\"Sea%20captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;, Lionel Moodie Heddle, had supervised \"Katoomba\"s building. He commanded her on her maiden voyage from the UK to Australia and remained her &lt;a href=\"Master%20mariner\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; for 23 years, in both civilian and military service.\n\"Katoomba\" began her maiden voyage by embarking passengers in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; Scotland. They included a small party who disembarked when she briefly anchored in &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Sound\"&gt;Plymouth Sound&lt;/a&gt;, England, and 237 passengers who were bound for Australia. On 11 August she reached &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"bunkering\"&gt;bunkering&lt;/a&gt;.

On 13 September she left Melbourne for Sydney, where on 18 September she was opened to news reporters and invited guests They were entertained by the \"\"Katoomba\" Ladies Orchestra\", which was in fact a &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; quartet of one pianist, two violinists and one singer. On 20 September \"Katoomba\" began scheduled service between Sydney and Fremantle \"via\" Melbourne and &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War I troop ship.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; \"Katoomba\" remained in civilian service until May 1918, when the Imperial Transport Department of the UK government requisitioned her and gave her the &lt;a href=\"pennant%20number\"&gt;pennant number&lt;/a&gt; D610. She sailed from Australia across the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, where she embarked US troops to take to Europe. She made a second transatlantic crossing bringing US troops to Britain, and was then transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918\"&gt;Armistice of 11 November 1918&lt;/a&gt; was signed \"Katoomba\" was in &lt;a href=\"Thessaloniki\"&gt;Salonika&lt;/a&gt;. She then became the first British troop ship to pass through the Dardanelles since the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Ottoman entry into World War I&lt;/a&gt; in 1914. On 14 November 1918 \"Katoomba\" left &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; carrying more than 2,000 troops of the &lt;a href=\"Essex%20Regiment\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Middlesex%20Regiment\"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt; regiments and 26 released Allied prisoners of war whom the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Army%20%281861%E2%80%931922%29\"&gt;Ottoman Army&lt;/a&gt; had captured in 1916 at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Kut\"&gt;siege of Kut&lt;/a&gt;. She made six round trips, repatriating a total of 14,000 British and Empire troops in one direction and Turks in the other. She visited &lt;a href=\"Mumbai%20Harbour\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; in April 1919, then Britain, and in August returned to Australia, where she was returned to her owners.\nInter\u2013war passenger service.\nIn 1920 \"Katoomba\" was refitted and returned to civilian service in Australian coastal waters. In 1934 the four-letter call sign VJDY superseded \"Katoomba\"s code letters and original three-letter call sign.\nIn the 1930s \"Katoomba\" undertook some Pacific &lt;a href=\"Cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruises&lt;/a&gt; that proved very popular. In October 1935 she took more than 430 &lt;a href=\"Methodist%20Church%20of%20Australasia\"&gt;Methodists&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"S%C4%81lote%20Tupou%20III\"&gt;S\u0101lote Tupou III&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; from Sydney to &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War II service.\n\"Katoomba\" remained in civilian service in the early years of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; until early 1941, when she was briefly requisitioned to take 1,496 troops from &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rabaul\"&gt;Rabaul&lt;/a&gt;, and then 687 troops from Sydney to &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;. She was then returned to civilian service.\nWhen Japan &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;attacked Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and other targets in the Pacific (Australian date 8 December 1941), \"Katoomba\" was taking troops to Rabaul and being escorted by . In response to the attacks \"Katoomba\" was held at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Moresby\"&gt;Port Moresby&lt;/a&gt;, then abandoned her trip to Rabaul and joined other ships evacuating civilians from &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Papua\"&gt;Papua&lt;/a&gt; and Darwin.\nIn February 1942 \"Katoomba\" was again requisitioned as a troop ship. A USAAF fighter group's ground troops and crated &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk\"&gt;Curtiss P-40 Warhawk&lt;/a&gt; aircraft was bound for &lt;a href=\"British%20Ceylon\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; aboard the troop ship , in convoy with and &lt;a href=\"SS%20President%20Taft%20%281920%29\"&gt;USAT \"Willard A. Holbrook\"&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the convoy reached Australia, \"Mariposa\"' was withdrawn and \"Katoomba\" and another Australian troop ship, , were substituted.\n\"Duntroon\", \"Katoomba\" and \"Willard A. Holbrook\" left Melbourne on 12 February. They reached Fremantle, where they joined and with aircraft for Java and formed Convoy MS 5. The convoy left Fremantle on 22 February, and \"Langley\" and \"Sea Witch\" later left the convoy to continue to Java. met MS 5 about west of &lt;a href=\"Cocos%20%28Keeling%29%20Islands\"&gt;Cocos Island&lt;/a&gt; on 28 February and escorted it to &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, where the convoy arrived on 5 March.\nFrom Colombo \"Katoomba\" sailed to India, called at &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; and then embarked 640 troops in &lt;a href=\"Mumbai%20Harbour\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;. They were members of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;Second Australian Imperial Force&lt;/a&gt; (Second AIF) who had served in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and were being redeployed to the south west Pacific. \"Katoomba\" left Bombay on 4 April, called at Colombo and &lt;a href=\"British%20Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;, reached Fremantle on 7 May and then continued via Adelaide to Sydney.\nOn 4 August 1942 \"Katoomba\" was again sailing from Fremantle to Adelaide when she survived being shelled by a submarine about off &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Albany, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1943 \"Katoomba\" was in Port Moresby when a sling of ammunition fell into one of her holds, causing an explosion that started a fire. Her &lt;a href=\"Chief%20mate\"&gt;Chief Officer&lt;/a&gt;, JS Burns and three &lt;a href=\"Able%20seaman\"&gt;able seamen&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to enter the hold and fight the fire, despite the danger that it could detonate ammunition in the hold. In January 1945 &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Dugan%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dugan%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;Winston Dugan&lt;/a&gt;, acting &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Governor-General of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, announced that the four men were to be commended.\nIn November 1945 \"Katoomba\" was delayed in Brisbane for three weeks, as her 40 stokers refused to sail because they were two men short. On 19 November she left Brisbane for &lt;a href=\"Bougainville%20Island\"&gt;Bougainville Island&lt;/a&gt; to repatriate Australian troops. A letter was published, allegedly written after a meeting of 3,000 &lt;a href=\"Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;AIF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; personnel on Bougainville awaiting repatriation, threatening that when \"Katoomba\" reached &lt;a href=\"Torokina\"&gt;Torokina&lt;/a&gt; harbour all the stokers would be thrown overboard. On 27 November the ship called at &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Townsville\"&gt;Townsville&lt;/a&gt;, where the stokers asked for the Army Minister &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Forde\"&gt;Frank Forde&lt;/a&gt; and Air Minister &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Drakeford\"&gt;Arthur Drakeford&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee their safety.\nPost-war civilian service.\nIn 1946 \"Katoomba\" was returned to her owners. That July the Goulandris brothers bought her for their Compa\u00f1\u00eda Maritima del Este subsidiary. Goulandris brothers' Ormos Shipping Company, which traded as &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Line\"&gt;Greek Line&lt;/a&gt;, managed her. On 6 October \"Katoomba\" left &lt;a href=\"Woolloomooloo\"&gt;Woolloomooloo&lt;/a&gt;, carrying 130 released Italian prisoners of war to be repatriated. She reached &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, where she was quickly refitted and her funnel was repainted in Greek Line colours.\nGreek Line put \"Katoomba\" on the route between &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Piraeus\"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt; and New York via Genoa and &lt;a href=\"Oran\"&gt;Oran&lt;/a&gt;. From 1947 until 1949 CGT chartered her and she sailed between France and the French West Indies. In 1949 \"Katoomba\" was again refitted in Genoa. She was converted from coal to oil-burning, she was renamed \"Columbia\", and her passenger accommodation was increased to carry 804 passengers: 52 first class and 752 second class.\nAfter her refit and renaming, \"Columbia\" made one more trip to the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Then on 25 November she left Genoa for Australia, reaching Fremantle on 17 December and Sydney on 26 December. From June 1950 she served Greek Line's route between &lt;a href=\"Ports%20of%20Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. In 1952 a fire damaged her in &lt;a href=\"Bremerhaven\"&gt;Bremerhaven&lt;/a&gt;. In 1954 Goulandris brothers transferred \"Columbia\"s ownership to another subsidiary, the Neptune Shipping Company.\nOn 18 August 1956 \"Columbia\" was in port at Quebec when the bow of &lt;a href=\"Home%20Lines\"&gt;Home Lines&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"SS%20Mariposa%20%281931%29\"&gt;Homeric&lt;/a&gt;\" struck her in fog. &lt;a href=\"Tugboat\"&gt;Tugs&lt;/a&gt; were towing \"Homeric\" at the time. of \"Columbia\"s starboard side was damaged, and some of her lifeboats were crushed. Greek Line arranged for her to be repaired in Bremerhaven.\nIn 1957 \"Columbia\" was transferred to the route between &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. However, in August she was again damaged by fire. On 21 October Greek Line withdrew her and laid her up at Bremerhaven.\nIn March 1958 \"Columbia\" was moved to Piraeus, where she remained laid up until August 1959, when she sailed for &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to be scrapped. On 29 September she reached &lt;a href=\"Nagasaki\"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt;."
