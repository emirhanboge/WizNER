    "text": "The states of the German Confederation were member states of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt; lasted from 20 June 1815 until 24 August 1866.\nOn the whole, its territory nearly coincided with that remaining in the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; at the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, with the notable exception of Belgium. Except for the two rival major powers, &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, and the western left bank of the Rhine (which France had annexed, with tiny &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Katzenelnbogen\"&gt;Katzenelnbogen&lt;/a&gt;), the other member states (or their precursors) had been within &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine\"&gt;Confederation of the Rhine&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe four free cities were &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;s by constitution, while all the others were monarchies, some &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"absolute%20monarchy\"&gt;absolutist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Duchy of Schleswig&lt;/a&gt; was never a member state. But Schleswig was traditionally connected to the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, which were member states. In 1848-51 (during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;First Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;), it was treated by the German states and the short-lived &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire%20%281848%E2%80%931849%29\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; as a kind of member. In 1864, the Danish king transferred the three duchies to Austria and Prussia (after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;Second Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;."
