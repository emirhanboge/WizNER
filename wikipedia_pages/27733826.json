In 1922, he joined &lt;a href=\"Fleisher%20Yarn\"&gt;Fleisher Yarn&lt;/a&gt; which played in the Allied Amateur League of Philadelphia. Fleisher moved up to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Soccer%20League%20%281921-1933%29\"&gt;American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 and Purvis scored seventeen goals in thirty-five league games and another two goals in two league cup games. On July 29, 1925, Purvis signed with &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%20Steel%20F.C.%20%281907%E2%80%9330%29\"&gt;Bethlehem Steel&lt;/a&gt;. Purvis scored twenty-one goals in twenty-two games before suffering a season ending ankle injury in April 1926. Bethlehem sent him to &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Flooring\"&gt;Indiana Flooring&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the season. He played one season with Indiana before moving to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Nationals%20%28ASL%29\"&gt;New York Nationals&lt;/a&gt; for the 1927-1928 season. He moved again, beginning the 1928-1929 season with &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Field%20Club%23Philadelphia%20F.C.%20III\"&gt;Philadelphia F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and finishing it with the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Wanderers\"&gt;Brooklyn Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to the &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport%20Bears\"&gt;Bridgeport Bears&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 1929, but when the team experienced significant financial difficulties with the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, the team merged with Philadelphia where Purvis finished his professional career.\nIn August 1935, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20United%20German-Hungarians\"&gt;Philadelphia United German-Hungarians&lt;/a&gt; hired Purvis to manage the team."
