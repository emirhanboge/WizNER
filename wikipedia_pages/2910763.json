    "text": "The Nullarbor Nymph was a &lt;a href=\"hoax\"&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt; perpetrated in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; between 1971 and 1972 that involved supposed sightings of a half-naked woman living amongst &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Nullarbor%20Plain\"&gt;Nullarbor Plain&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\nThe first report on 26 December 1971 was by professional kangaroo shooters from &lt;a href=\"Eucla%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Eucla&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, near the border with &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;. They claimed to have seen a &lt;a href=\"blond\"&gt;blond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; woman amongst some kangaroos, and backed their story with grainy amateur film showing a woman wearing &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt; skins and holding a kangaroo by the tail. After further sightings were claimed, the story was reported around the world, and journalists descended upon the town of Eucla which had a population of 8 people at the time.\nUnveiling of the hoax.\nThe incident was eventually revealed as a hoax, initiated as a publicity stunt. The girl on the film turned out to be a 17-year-old model named Janice Beeby. She did appear in a photograph taken later, as an evidence of the Nullarbor Nymph, but the woman in the original photograph used by the media to disseminate the hoax was Geneice Brooker, the partner of Laurie Scott, one of the kangaroo-shooter hoaxers. Scott admitted to &lt;a href=\"Murray%20Nicoll\"&gt;Murray Nicoll&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20News%20%28Adelaide%29\"&gt;The News&lt;/a&gt;\" that the hoax was created by a publicist who happened to be in the Eucla Hotel and had contacts within the media.\nInfluence.\nNullarbor Nymph sculptures by Dora Dallwitz were shown in 1994 at an exhibition held for students graduating from their Master of Visual Arts degree in Sculpture, and in 2000 and 2004 at Topfloor Gallery in Adelaide. Her main sculpture \"After the Nullarbor Nymph\", which was cast into bronze, was exhibited in front of the SA Museum for three months, was selected in the 2004 Sculpture By the Sea exhibition in Sydney, and is now on display in front of the &lt;a href=\"Flinders%20Medical%20Centre\"&gt;Flinders Medical Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Adelaide.\nIn 1994 an installation at the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20Gallery\"&gt;Australian National Gallery&lt;/a&gt; referred to the myth. The issue is raised as an urban myth periodically.\nIn 2012 a low-budget movie titled \"The Nullarbor Nymph\" was produced out of &lt;a href=\"Ceduna%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Ceduna, South Australia&lt;/a&gt; and written and directed by Mathew J. Wilkinson. The &lt;a href=\"mockumentary\"&gt;mockumentary&lt;/a&gt; depicts the Nymph as tormenting men who travel across the Nullarbor. The film premiered in Ceduna on 3 March 2012 and then across Australia in following months. The film received much hype thanks to radio announcer &lt;a href=\"Merrick%20Watts\"&gt;Merrick Watts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Triple%20M\"&gt;Triple M&lt;/a&gt;'s Merrick and \"The Highway Patrol\" show which aired across Australia. A &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; premiere was held on 22 May 2012 and the film received positive reviews given its $25,000 budget."
