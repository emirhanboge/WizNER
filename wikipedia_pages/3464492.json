    "text": "Kolaramma is the presiding &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; of the town of &lt;a href=\"Kolar\"&gt;Kolar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karnataka\"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The Kolaramma temple is thousand years old and built by the &lt;a href=\"Chola%20Rulers\"&gt;Cholas&lt;/a&gt; in the South Indian style. Goddess &lt;a href=\"Parvathi\"&gt;Parvathi&lt;/a&gt; is worshipped as Kolaramma by the people of Kolar. The erstwhile maharajas of &lt;a href=\"Mysore\"&gt;Mysore&lt;/a&gt; frequently visited this temple to get the blessings of Kolaramma. The temple itself has beautifully carved statues and designs all done using the abundantly available &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; stones.\nAnother deity of this temple is &lt;a href=\"Chelamma\"&gt;Chelamma&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Scorpion%20goddess%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;scorpion goddess&lt;/a&gt;. People believe that by praying at the Chelamma shrine a person will be guarded from &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt; bites by the deity.\nAnother interesting thing about the temple is the &lt;a href=\"Hundi%20%28cash%20collection%20box%29\"&gt;hundi&lt;/a&gt; or the well which is used to collect money offerings from the people, and it is a tradition to at least put one coin into the small opening on the floor of the temple, which apparently is a large hole dug into the earth, one can still hear the clicking sounds of coins accumulated over hundreds of years.
