    "text": "Mitochondrion is a Canadian &lt;a href=\"black%20metal\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"death%20metal\"&gt;death metal&lt;/a&gt; band from &lt;a href=\"Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Victoria, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 2003. The band has undergone some line-up changes, but since 2006 Mitochondrion was solidified as a &lt;a href=\"power%20trio\"&gt;power trio&lt;/a&gt; with Shawn Hach\u00e9 (guitar, vocals), Nick Yanchuk (guitar, vocals, bass) and Karl Godard (drums, keyboards). With this line-up Mitochondrion has recorded two full-length studio albums, the self-released \"Archaeaeon\"\u00a0(2008) and \"Parasignosis\"\u00a0(2011), which was released through &lt;a href=\"Profound%20Lore%20Records\"&gt;Profound Lore Records&lt;/a&gt;. They later released an EP \"Antinumerology\" released by Dark Descent Records and Krucyator Productions and a split EP \"In Cronian Hour\" released by Dark Descent Records and Hellthrasher Productions.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"music%20criticism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, \"What makes Mitochondrion stand out is their ability to bring order to chaos. [...] It is a trait they share with &lt;a href=\"Deathspell%20Omega\"&gt;Deathspell Omega&lt;/a&gt;, who craft a dizzying amount of sounds and influences into something palpably evil and eminently listenable. When most other bands try this, it sounds like they are toying with forces they do not understand.\" The musicianship on \"Parasignosis\" has been defined by \"&lt;a href=\"Decibel%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Decibel&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine as a \"dense, not-so-easily-digestible labyrinth of frightening ,\" while \"Parasignosis\" itself was praised as a \", highly individual album.\""
