    "text": "Sigurd is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in four acts and nine scenes by the French composer &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Reyer\"&gt;Ernest Reyer&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Camille%20du%20Locle\"&gt;Camille du Locle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Blau\"&gt;Alfred Blau&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Nibelung\"&gt;Ring of the Nibelung&lt;/a&gt;\", the story is based on the \"&lt;a href=\"Nibelungenlied\"&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Edda\"&gt;Edda&lt;/a&gt;s, with some crucial differences from the better known Wagnerian version (the role of the supernatural is limited and replaced in large part by fate; the initial version of the libretto with a prologue set in heaven was later cut out). The whole opera can best be described as an epic with techniques of the &lt;a href=\"grand%20opera\"&gt;grand opera&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially sketched out in 1862 (and virtually completed in draft by 1867), the work waited many years before it was performed in full. &lt;a href=\"Orchestration\"&gt;Orchestration&lt;/a&gt; of various fragments progressed much more slowly, and as they were completed, they were sometimes performed at various concerts. Initial attempts at staging the work at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Op%C3%A9ra\"&gt;Paris Op\u00e9ra&lt;/a&gt; failed, therefore the opera had its world premiere in the &lt;a href=\"La%20Monnaie\"&gt;Th\u00e9atre de la Monnaie&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels on 7 January 1884 (directed by &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Lapissida\"&gt;Alexandre Lapissida&lt;/a&gt;). Within a year it was also performed with great success at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, Covent Garden; Lyon, Monte Carlo and, finally, at the &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Garnier\"&gt;Paris Op\u00e9ra&lt;/a&gt; on 12 June 1885, (directed there by Raoul Lapissida).\nIn America, the opera was first performed on 24 December 1891 at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Opera%20House\"&gt;French Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans, and the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20alla%20Scala\"&gt;Teatro alla Scala&lt;/a&gt; in Milan performed it in 1894. Since then it has had periodic revivals (but only in France or Monaco); then, after World War II, it was staged in 1963 and 1995 at the &lt;a href=\"Op%C3%A9ra%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Op\u00e9ra de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; (the last one with Alberto Cupido in the title role). The opera was also performed in 1973 in concert at studio 104 of the &lt;a href=\"Office%20de%20Radiodiffusion%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20Fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt; (ORTF) in Paris (&lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Rosenthal\"&gt;Manuel Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt; was conducting; (the performance was recorded) and in 1993 at &lt;a href=\"Festival%20de%20Radio%20France%20et%20Montpellier\"&gt;Festival de Radio France et Montpellier&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoles.\nIn the ballets:\nSynopsis.\nHilda, the younger sister of Gunther, king of the Burgundians, loves the hero Sigurd, despite the fact that she was expected to be given to Attila himself as a bride. At the instigation of her nurse (Uta) she gives Sigurd a magic potion which brings him to her feet. Sigurd, Gunther and Hagen then swear fealty to each other and set off to Iceland, where Brunehild lies asleep upon a lofty rock, surrounded by a circle of fire and some supernatural beings. There, Sigurd, to earn the hand of Hilda, must overcome those monsters. He achieves this and passes through the flames to win Brunehild for Gunther. His face is closely hidden by his visor, and Brunehild in all innocence accepts Gunther as her saviour, and gives herself to him. The secret is afterwards disclosed by Hilda in a fit of jealous rage, whereupon Brunehild releases Sigurd from the enchantment of the potion. He recognises her as the bride ordained for him by the gods, and they sing a passionate love duet, but before he can taste his new-found happiness he is treacherously slain by Gunther while hunting. His body is brought back to the palace and Brunehild mounts the funeral pyre. A powerful apotheosis ends the opera when spirits of Sigurd and Brunehild ascend to paradise, and soldiers of Attila are seen walking over corpses of Burgundians.\nReferences.\nNotes"
