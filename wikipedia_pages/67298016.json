The island is also one of two outliers to the south of Rotuma, the other being &lt;a href=\"Solkope\"&gt;Solkope&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; in the area is &lt;a href=\"temperate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt;.

The legend tells of two girls who slip from a flat rock platform at the top of the island and fell to the sea. The girls did not die but were instead changed into two immortal &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, one red and one white. They are said to live in the &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt; under the rock, and can be called up at any time by singing an &lt;a href=\"incantation\"&gt;incantation&lt;/a&gt;."
