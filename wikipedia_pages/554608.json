    "title": "Nahanni National Park Reserve",
    "text": "Nahanni National Park Reserve in the &lt;a href=\"Dehcho%20Region\"&gt;Dehcho Region&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territories\"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;, Canada, approximately west of &lt;a href=\"Yellowknife\"&gt;Yellowknife&lt;/a&gt;, protects a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Mackenzie%20Mountains\"&gt;Mackenzie Mountains&lt;/a&gt; Natural Region. The centrepiece of the park is the &lt;a href=\"South%20Nahanni%20River\"&gt;South Nahanni River&lt;/a&gt; (\"Naha Deh\u00e9\"). Four noteworthy canyons reaching in depth, called First, Second, Third and Fourth Canyon, line its &lt;a href=\"whitewater\"&gt;whitewater&lt;/a&gt; river. The name Nahanni comes from the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Dene\"&gt;Dene&lt;/a&gt; language name for the area; Nah\u0294a Deh\u00e9, which means \"river of the land of the Nah\u0294a people\". The park was among the world's first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; in 1978 because of its picturesque wild rivers, canyons, and waterfalls. The park is also said to be haunted, following the mysterious disappearances and deaths of several gold prospectors over the years.\nGeography.\nThere are several different landforms in the park that have taken millions of years to form, and give it a diversity not seen in any other &lt;a href=\"National%20Parks%20of%20Canada\"&gt;national park in Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Sediment left by an ancient &lt;a href=\"Inland%20sea%20%28geology%29\"&gt;inland sea&lt;/a&gt; 500-200 million years ago had since become pressed into layers of rock. These layers were stacked about deep and are peppered with fossils, remnants of these ancient sea beds. As the continents shifted, the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Plate\"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Plate\"&gt;Pacific Plate&lt;/a&gt;s collided, the force of which pushed the layers of rock upwards. Ridges of rock bent and broke, leaving behind the ranges seen today. This same action also caused volcanic activity, sending molten lava into but not through the sedimentary rock. While there are no volcanoes in the park, towers of heated rock called igneous &lt;a href=\"batholith\"&gt;batholith&lt;/a&gt;s were sent upwards, pushing the sediment further up. The top layer of sedimentary rock was eventually worn away, resulting in granite towers that form the Ragged Range.\nOver the last 2 million years, glaciers have covered most of North America, creating most of the land formations seen today. While previous ice ages affected the park area, the most recent, the &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20glaciation\"&gt;Wisconsin Ice Age&lt;/a&gt; (85,000-10,000 years ago), touched only the most western and eastern parts of the park. This has left many geological features in the park much more time to develop than most of North America had.\nThe central feature of the park is the South Nahanni River which runs the length of the park, beginning near &lt;a href=\"Moose%20Ponds\"&gt;Moose Ponds&lt;/a&gt; and ending when it meets the &lt;a href=\"Liard%20River\"&gt;Liard River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Nahanni%20Butte\"&gt;Nahanni Butte&lt;/a&gt;. The South Nahanni is a rare example of an antecedent river. The mountains rose slowly enough, and the river was powerful enough, that the river maintained its course over its history, meaning it has the same path today as it did before the mountains rose. As the river was meandering, the canyons it carved also meander. Most visitors only visit the portions from &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Falls%20%28Northwest%20Territories%29\"&gt;Virginia Falls&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nailicho\") down.\nThere are four main canyons that line the South Nahanni River, named by prospectors, numbering them as they travelled up the river. The fourth canyon, also called Painted Canyon or Five Mile Canyon due to its length, begins with Virginia Falls, and was created as the falls eroded the limestone surrounding the river, working its way upstream. Third canyon runs through Funeral Range, around long. Because its walls are composed of strata of shale, sandstones and limestone, this canyon has long slopes instead of steep, flat walls like the lower canyons. Big Bend, a point where the river does a 45-degree turn, marks the end of Third and the beginning of Second Canyon. At long, it runs through the Headless Range. The final canyon is considered the most beautiful. Beginning after Deadmen Valley, First Canyon boasts the highest, most vertical walls, cutting through very resistant limestone. It ends near Kraus Hotsprings, making it about long. Following this, the river slows and braids into different channels, passing through the park boundary, and coming together again near the village of Nahanni Butte. Soon after the town, the South Nahanni River joins the Liard River.\nNotable mountains in the park include &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Nirvana\"&gt;Mount Nirvana&lt;/a&gt; (), officially an unnamed peak, which at is the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories. Slightly further north lies &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Sir%20James%20MacBrien\"&gt;Mount Sir James MacBrien&lt;/a&gt; (), the territories second highest peak at , and &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Flower%20Tower\"&gt;Lotus Flower Tower&lt;/a&gt; (, ) both of which form part of the &lt;a href=\"Cirque%20of%20the%20Unclimbables\"&gt;Cirque of the Unclimbables&lt;/a&gt; ().\nVirginia Falls.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Falls%20%28Northwest%20Territories%29\"&gt;Virginia Falls&lt;/a&gt; or \"Nailicho\" in Dene (), the river plunges in a thunderous plume. Including the Sluice Box Rapids above the falls, it is more than twice the height of &lt;a href=\"Niagara%20Falls\"&gt;Niagara Falls&lt;/a&gt;. In the centre of the falls is a dramatic spire of resistant rock, called Mason's Rock after &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Mason\"&gt;Bill Mason&lt;/a&gt;, the famous Canadian canoeist, author, and filmmaker. The falls were initially located downstream at the east end of Fourth Canyon, and over the centuries carved through the limestone rock that surrounds the river. This continuous erosion shifted the falls upstream and created the Fourth Canyon. Due to the mist, the immediate vicinity of the falls is home to several rare &lt;a href=\"Orchidaceae\"&gt;orchid&lt;/a&gt; species. Downstream from the falls, there are many notable rapids on the river including Figure Eight, George's Riffle, and Lafferty's Riffle.\nRabbitkettle Hotsprings.\nThe Rabbitkettle (\"Gahn\u00eehthah\") Hotsprings and tufa mounds () are the largest of &lt;a href=\"tufa\"&gt;tufa&lt;/a&gt; mounds in Canada. The largest of the mounds, the North Mound, is high and across. The source of the springs comes from deep in the Earth's crust, near the base of the granite batholiths that form the Ragged Range. The volcanic activity that raised the mountains still heats the water deep below the surface of the Earth. The heated water percolates upwards, dissolving calcium carbonate from limestone deposits on its way by. When it reaches the surface springs, the water cools and the calcium carbonate particles are released. These microscopic particles settle to form porous calcite rims around the pools of water. These pools range in size from that of a bathtub to that of a fingernail. This process takes a great deal of time, and it is believed that the mounds themselves are around 10,000 years old, their creation beginning at the end of the last ice age.\nThese rare and fragile features are protected as a Zone 1, Special Preservation Area, and all visitors must be accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Parks%20Canada\"&gt;Parks Canada&lt;/a&gt; staff in order to minimize impact and visitors to the North Mound are required to be barefoot.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe park's &lt;a href=\"Sulfur\"&gt;sulphur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hot%20spring\"&gt;hot spring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"alpine%20tundra\"&gt;alpine tundra&lt;/a&gt;, mountain ranges, and forests of &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aspen\"&gt;aspen&lt;/a&gt; are home to many species of birds, fish and mammals. The park lies within three of &lt;a href=\"Ecozones%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Canada's ecozones&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Taiga%20Cordillera%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29\"&gt;Taiga Cordillera&lt;/a&gt; in the west, the &lt;a href=\"Taiga%20Plains%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29\"&gt;Taiga Plains&lt;/a&gt; in the east and a small southern portion in the &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Cordillera%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29\"&gt;Boreal Cordillera&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Parks Canada there are 42 mammal, 180 bird, 16 fish and a few amphibian species found in the park. In the \"State of the Park Report 2009\" the NWT government showed ten species that the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20on%20the%20Status%20of%20Endangered%20Wildlife%20in%20Canada\"&gt;Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada&lt;/a&gt; (COSEWIC) had listed as special concern, &lt;a href=\"Threatened%20species\"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; that Nahanni National Park Reserve provides seasonal and year-round habitat for. These include &lt;a href=\"common%20nighthawk\"&gt;common nighthawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grizzly%20bear\"&gt;grizzly bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"olive-sided%20flycatcher\"&gt;olive-sided flycatcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peregrine%20falcon\"&gt;peregrine falcon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rusty%20blackbird\"&gt;rusty blackbird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short-eared%20owl\"&gt;short-eared owl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood%20bison\"&gt;wood bison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20woodland%20caribou\"&gt;woodland caribou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolverine\"&gt;wolverine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"yellow%20rail\"&gt;yellow rail&lt;/a&gt;. In addition the &lt;a href=\"bull%20trout\"&gt;bull trout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Symphyotrichum%20nahanniense\"&gt;Nahanni aster&lt;/a&gt; are listed but without a status and the &lt;a href=\"Canada%20warbler\"&gt;Canada warbler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"western%20toad\"&gt;western toad&lt;/a&gt; are listed as possibly existing in the park.\nMammal species found in the park include; &lt;a href=\"American%20black%20bear\"&gt;black bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"northwestern%20wolf\"&gt;timber wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"western%20moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shrew\"&gt;shrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vole\"&gt;vole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20ground%20squirrel\"&gt;Arctic ground squirrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marmot\"&gt;marmot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20mink\"&gt;mink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20marten\"&gt;pine marten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada%20lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowshoe%20hare\"&gt;snowshoe hare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20river%20otter\"&gt;river otter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"muskrat\"&gt;muskrat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;.\nBirds include the &lt;a href=\"American%20kestrel\"&gt;American kestrel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bald%20eagle\"&gt;bald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagle\"&gt;golden eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"loon\"&gt;loon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"red-necked%20grebe\"&gt;red-necked grebe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sharp-shinned%20hawk\"&gt;sharp-shinned hawk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trumpeter%20swan\"&gt;trumpeter swan&lt;/a&gt;s. It also includes the only known nesting site of the &lt;a href=\"whooping%20crane\"&gt;whooping crane&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish found in the park include, &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20grayling\"&gt;Arctic grayling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"burbot\"&gt;burbot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nelma\"&gt;inconnu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lake%20trout\"&gt;lake trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lake%20chub\"&gt;lake chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lake%20whitefish\"&gt;lake whitefish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"longnose%20dace\"&gt;longnose dace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"longnose%20sucker\"&gt;longnose sucker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20whitefish\"&gt;mountain whitefish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"northern%20pike\"&gt;northern pike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"round%20whitefish\"&gt;round whitefish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slimy%20sculpin\"&gt;slimy sculpin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spoonhead%20sculpin\"&gt;spoonhead sculpin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spottail%20shiner\"&gt;spottail shiner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Percopsis%20omiscomaycus\"&gt;trout-perch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe diverse range of soils offers several specialized and uncommon habitats. More than 700 species of &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plant\"&gt;vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s and 300 species of both &lt;a href=\"bryophyte\"&gt;bryophyte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the park, giving it a richer variety than any other area in the NWT. &lt;a href=\"Symphyotrichum%20nahanniense\"&gt;Nahanni aster&lt;/a&gt; is a very rare species of aster found only in the Park.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dene\"&gt;Dene&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called &lt;a href=\"Slavey\"&gt;Slavey&lt;/a&gt;, peoples have used the lands around Nahanni National Park Reserve for thousands of years. The first human occupation of the area is estimated to have occurred 9,000-10,000 years ago. Evidence of prehistoric human use has been found at Yohin Lake and a few other sites within the park. The local oral history contains many references to the Naha tribe, a mountain-dwelling people who used to raid settlements in the adjacent lowlands. These people are said to have rather quickly and mysteriously disappeared.\nFirst contact with European &lt;a href=\"fur%20trade\"&gt;fur trade&lt;/a&gt;rs expanding into the region occurred in the 18th century, and was increased with &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Alexander Mackenzie's&lt;/a&gt; exploration of the &lt;a href=\"Mackenzie%20River\"&gt;Mackenzie River&lt;/a&gt; (Deh Cho), and building of &lt;a href=\"trading%20post\"&gt;trading post&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Simpson\"&gt;Fort Simpson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Liard\"&gt;Fort Liard&lt;/a&gt;. At both of these &lt;a href=\"John%20McLeod%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;John McLeod&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish explorer of the area, was to serve as manager. During the 19th century, most Dene families left their nomadic lifestyles and settled into more permanent communities, often close to the trading posts. Permanent settlements were established at locations such as Nahanni Butte, Fort Liard and Fort Simpson.\nIn the late 19th century, the Mountain Indians of the Nahanni region would travel down the Nahanni River each spring in mooseskin boats to trade the winter take of furs. These boats, based on the &lt;a href=\"York%20boat\"&gt;York boat&lt;/a&gt;s used by the &lt;a href=\"Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company\"&gt;Hudson's Bay Company&lt;/a&gt;, were up to in length. Constructed from six to ten untanned moose hides sewn together and stretched over a spruce pole frame, these boats would transport entire families, their dogs and cargo of furs down the river during high water. Upon arrival the boat was dismantled and the hides traded along with the furs. Following a visit to the forts, these people would return to the high country with only what they could carry on their pack dogs.\nThe stories of the Naha, and dangerous landscape that they inhabited, grew in stature with the &lt;a href=\"Klondike%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;Klondike Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt; as some explorers attempted to use the Nahanni as a path to the famous gold fields of the &lt;a href=\"Yukon\"&gt;Yukon&lt;/a&gt;, or to try and make their fortune on the Flat and South Nahanni Rivers. Although no significant gold was found, legends of haunted valleys and lost gold emerged after the headless corpses of &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9tis%20in%20Canada\"&gt;M\u00e9tis&lt;/a&gt; prospectors Willie and Frank McLeod were found around 1908. The &lt;a href=\"Lost%20McLeod%20Mine\"&gt;Lost McLeod Mine&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20lost%20mines\"&gt;lost mine&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the park, is supposed to have been where the two brothers found their gold. In the years that followed, mysterious deaths of other prospectors added to the legends. The names of park features such as Deadmen Valley, Headless Creek, Headless Range and the Funeral Range bear testimony to these stories and legends. In later years &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Faille\"&gt;Albert Faille&lt;/a&gt; was a prospector in the area and met writer &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20M.%20Patterson\"&gt;Raymond M. Patterson&lt;/a&gt;. The latter's works brought minor fame to Faille.\nIn 1946 Calgary geologist and mining expert &lt;a href=\"Frank%20M.%20W.%20Henderson\"&gt;Frank M. W. Henderson&lt;/a&gt; returned from the valley reporting his partner Jack Patterson had disappeared. Henderson and Patterson had agreed to meet at a point near Virginia Falls. The first to arrive would leave a message on a large tree which both knew from previous trips. Henderson arrived first and left his message before traveling into the valley. He returned several weeks later only to find there was still no message left by Patterson. Henderson and his party camped there a few days, but one night were awoken by a group of First Nations people who warned of white figures moving along the valley.\nIn 1947 author &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Berton\"&gt;Pierre Berton&lt;/a&gt; was sent by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Vancouver%20Sun\"&gt;The Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" to cover the north. He, along with pilot &lt;a href=\"Russ%20Baker%20%28pilot%29\"&gt;Russ Baker&lt;/a&gt;, flew up the Headless Valley. Writing on his journey for Macleans Berton remarked, \"Frank Henderson himself, a man who perhaps has good reason not to want too many people rushing into the valley, was quoted as saying, on his return from the area last fall, 'There is absolutely no denying the sinister atmosphere of that whole valley. The weird, continual wailing of the wind is something I won\u2019t, soon forget.'\"\nIn 1964, explorer parachutist Jean Poirel from Montreal jumped at its source north of &lt;a href=\"Yellowknife\"&gt;Yellowknife&lt;/a&gt;, followed by his teammate Bertrand Bordet. Jean Poirel imagined the idea of going down the river with inflatable dinghies. During the following four consecutive expeditions in the valley Jean Poirel discovered more than 250 caverns. The most important contained 116 &lt;a href=\"Dall%20sheep\"&gt;Dall sheep&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s skeletons (&lt;a href=\"Radiocarbon%20dating\"&gt;carbon-14 dated&lt;/a&gt; to 2500 years BC); Jean Poirel named it \"Valerie Cavern\" after his daughter. He took topographic notes and drew detailed maps, paving the way for the park's creation. During his last expedition in 1972, he escorted Pierre Trudeau, who came in person to evaluate this superb and fascinating region.\nPark history.\nOriginally established in 1972, by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the park was in area. The park was in \"reserve\" status pending settlement of outstanding &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20title\"&gt;Aboriginal land claims&lt;/a&gt; in the region. In 2003, an agreement between the &lt;a href=\"Dehcho%20First%20Nations\"&gt;Dehcho First Nations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parks%20Canada\"&gt;Parks Canada&lt;/a&gt; gave temporary protection to . In August 2007, the federal government added an extra .\nIn a novel form of cooperation between federal government and native groups, the Naha Dehe Consensus Team was formed in June 2000 by Canada and the Dehcho First Nations. Their original main tasks included:\nIn 2003, these were completed and the purpose of the team changed, now dealing with cooperative management issues, according to the Interim Park Management Arrangement, until the Dehcho Process is completed.\nOn 9 June 2009 the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Government of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, with the Dehcho First Nations, announced legislation that will increase the area of Nahanni National Park to cover , including 91% of the Greater Nahanni ecosystem in the Dehcho Region and most of the South Nahanni River watershed.\nThe new park area is estimated to be the home of around 500 grizzly bears, two herds of woodland caribou, as well as species of alpine sheep and goats and other species. The new boundary will include the highest mountains and largest &lt;a href=\"ice%20field\"&gt;ice field&lt;/a&gt;s in the Northwest Territories. With the expansion of the park there have been several added designated landing sites. Because most access to the park is done by aircraft and air access is restricted in the park, there are set places aircraft can land. Before the expansion these were limited to Virginia Falls and Rabbitkettle Lake. Now there are five more: the Bunny Bar, Island Lake, Honeymoon Lake, Glacier Lake, and Seaplane Lake. However, only Virginia Falls and Glacier Lake are designated for day use visitation, meaning all other sites require visitors to stay overnight in the park.\nA visitor centre in Fort Simpson features displays on the history, culture and geography of the area. The park was among the world's first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; in 1978. The South Nahanni River achieved &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Heritage%20Rivers%20System\"&gt;Canadian Heritage Rive&lt;/a&gt;r status in 1987. Presently around 800\u20131000 people visit the park every year, most of which are overnight visitors who travel down the South Nahanni. The park is open year-round, but most visitors come in June, July, and August. Virginia Falls is the only area of the park where a reservation is required, which must be done months in advance to prevent overcrowding. For safety reasons, all visitors must register with park officials upon entering the park boundaries, and deregister within 24 hours of leaving. There is a park office in &lt;a href=\"Nahanni%20Butte\"&gt;Nahanni Butte&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the river, where visitors can deregister. The only practical way to get to Nahanni National Park is by &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt; or by helicopter, usually from Fort Simpson but other communities and locations offering a gateway into the park include: &lt;a href=\"Watson%20Lake%2C%20Yukon\"&gt;Watson Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muncho%20Lake\"&gt;Muncho Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Nelson%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Fort Nelson&lt;/a&gt; and Inconnu Lodge. Some people do hike in from the &lt;a href=\"Nahanni%20Range%20Road\"&gt;Nahanni Range Road&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tungsten%2C%20Northwest%20Territories\"&gt;Tungsten&lt;/a&gt; to the west of the park.\nIn 2007 the park was voted one of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Wonders%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Seven Wonders of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in a competition sponsored by &lt;a href=\"CBC%20Television\"&gt;CBC Television&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20National%20%28TV%20program%29\"&gt;The National&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"CBC%20Radio%20One\"&gt;CBC Radio One&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Sounds%20Like%20Canada\"&gt;Sounds Like Canada&lt;/a&gt;\". The park was the subject of a short film in 2011's \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Parks%20Project\"&gt;National Parks Project&lt;/a&gt;\", directed by Kevin McMahon and scored by &lt;a href=\"Shad%20%28rapper%29\"&gt;Shad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Lasek\"&gt;Jace Lasek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Besnard%20Lakes\"&gt;Olga Goreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn fiction.\nThe area was featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Sick%20Heart%20River\"&gt;Sick Heart River&lt;/a&gt;\", a fictional river in the Nahanni area, by &lt;a href=\"John%20Buchan\"&gt;John Buchan&lt;/a&gt;, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20General%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Governor General of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Buchan had not visited the Nahanni but had travelled down the Mackenzie and wanted to visit the area. \"The River\", a book by Cheryl Kaye Tardif, is based on stories and legends from the area.\nThe Nahanni River and its surroundings has also been featured in the French book \"La Vall\u00e9e Sans Homme\", written in 1973 by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Frison-Roche\"&gt;Roger Frison-Roche&lt;/a&gt;."
