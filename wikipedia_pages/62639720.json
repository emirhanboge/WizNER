    "text": "The Sound of Barra is a large ocean inlet or &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; situated to the north of the &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;isle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Barra\"&gt;Barra&lt;/a&gt; and to the south of &lt;a href=\"South%20Uist\"&gt;South Uist&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20Hebrides\"&gt;Outer Hebrides&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2014 it has been designated as a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation\"&gt;Special Area of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; (SAC). The Sound of Barra is composed of 98.91% marine and inlet areas, 1.07% mudflats and other semi-submerged areas and 0.02% sea cliffs and &lt;a href=\"islets\"&gt;islets&lt;/a&gt;. There are ten islands in the sound, with only &lt;a href=\"Eriskay\"&gt;Eriskay&lt;/a&gt; still being inhabited:\nThere is a ferry service across the sound from &lt;a href=\"Ardmore%2C%20Barra\"&gt;Ardmore&lt;/a&gt; () on Barra to &lt;a href=\"Ceann%20a%27%20Gh%C3%A0raidh\"&gt;Ceann a' Gh\u00e0raidh&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Eriskay\"&gt;Eriskay&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000 it was proposed that the Sound of Barra should become a SAC. A 12-week consultation process was undertaken by &lt;a href=\"NatureScot\"&gt;Scottish Natural Heritage&lt;/a&gt; (SNH) on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Government\"&gt;Scottish Government&lt;/a&gt; in the autumn of 2011 with two public meetings held in &lt;a href=\"Castlebay\"&gt;Castlebay&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Barra\"&gt;Barra&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Eriskay\"&gt;Eriskay&lt;/a&gt; as well as inviting submissions by letter and e-mail. SAC status was confirmed on 3 December 2014. The primary reasons for its status as a SAC are the benefits to &lt;a href=\"marine%20conservation\"&gt;marine conservation&lt;/a&gt; of its sandbanks and reefs with their diverse &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and including &lt;a href=\"maerl\"&gt;maerl&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"red%20algae\"&gt;red algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; communities and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"barnacles\"&gt;barnacles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mussels\"&gt;mussels&lt;/a&gt; and the presence of &lt;a href=\"harbour%20seals\"&gt;harbour seals&lt;/a&gt; also being a qualifying feature.
