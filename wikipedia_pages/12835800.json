He then headed out of the Czech Republic, spending time at &lt;a href=\"Odd%20Grenland\"&gt;Odd Grenland&lt;/a&gt; in Norway and &lt;a href=\"Artmedia%20Bratislava\"&gt;Artmedia Bratislava&lt;/a&gt; in Slovakia. In 2009, he returned to the Czech Republic to play for &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Brno\"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;.\nPosp\u011bch joined Second League side &lt;a href=\"SFC%20Opava\"&gt;Opava&lt;/a&gt; in September 2009, five years after having left his boyhood club. In November 2009, the Czech Disciplinary Commission suspended Posp\u011bch, which left him unable to play professional football until October 2010.\nPosp\u011bch moved on loan from Brno to &lt;a href=\"SK%20Slavia%20Prague\"&gt;Slavia Prague&lt;/a&gt; in February 2011 until the end of June.

In June 2011, as his loan was coming to an end, he signed a three-year contract with Slavia.
