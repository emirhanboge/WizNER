    "text": "Remnants of War is the second album by &lt;a href=\"Helstar\"&gt;Helstar&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Records\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. It was recorded following a lineup change and a change of studio to Mad Dog Studios in California. The sound of the album was a gradual progression from the traditional &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; style of the band's debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Star%20%28album%29\"&gt;Burning Star&lt;/a&gt;\" towards the &lt;a href=\"power%20metal\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"thrash%20metal\"&gt;thrash&lt;/a&gt; sound that the band forged throughout the 1980s. It was the last album released on &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Records\"&gt;Combat Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrack listing.\nAll tracks written by Helstar."
