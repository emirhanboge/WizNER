After four appearances as a replacement in rounds two to five, he made four consecutive starts later in the season. It was a disappointing season for the defending champions, winning just three of their fourteen matches and finishing the season in sixth position.\nHalvorsen started the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Vodacom%20Cup\"&gt;2013 Vodacom Cup&lt;/a&gt; season in good form, scoring two first-half tries in a 27\u201323 victory over a in his first appearance of the season.

He immediately established himself as the first-choice number eight at Mogliano, starting 18 of their 22 matches during the season and scoring two tries. Mogliano finished in third position on the log and Halvorsen featured in their 19-22 and 30\u201331 defeats against &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Rovigo%20Delta\"&gt;Rovigo&lt;/a&gt; in the two-legged semi-final. In addition to the National Championship of Excellence, Halvorsen also made five appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20European%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2013\u201314 European Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it wasn't enough as his side lost the match 15\u201330, and a 24\u201323 second leg victory wasn't enough to overturn the deficit, which meant Mogliano got eliminated at the semi-final stage for the second season in a row.\nAs in 2014\u201315, Halvorsen made 14 starts and two appearances off the bench in the 2015\u20132016 season. He contributed two tries over the course of the season, helping Mogliano reach the semi-finals for the third season in succession since he joined the club. However, his team was also eliminated at this stage for the third season in a row, losing 10\u201313 and 17\u201334 to Rovigo in the two legs of their semi-final play-off matches.\nSWD Eagles.\nIn June 2016, Halvorsen returned to South Africa, joining the &lt;a href=\"George%2C%20Western%20Cape\"&gt;George, Western Cape&lt;/a&gt;-based during the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Currie%20Cup%20qualification\"&gt;2016 Currie Cup qualification&lt;/a&gt; series.
