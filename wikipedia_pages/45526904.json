    "text": "The Black Watch Brigade was a &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 1908, it was not part of any &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;, instead being assigned to Coastal Defence duties in &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Command\"&gt;Scottish Command&lt;/a&gt;. It was dissolved in early 1915 as its constituent &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt;s were posted to other formations.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt; (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907\"&gt;Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907&lt;/a&gt; (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old &lt;a href=\"Volunteer%20Force%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;Volunteer Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Honourable%20Artillery%20Company\"&gt;Honourable Artillery Company&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yeomanry\"&gt;Yeomanry&lt;/a&gt;. On formation, the TF contained 14 &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;s and 14 mounted yeomanry &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt;s. Three more infantry brigades also existed outside the divisional structure: the Black Watch Brigade, the &lt;a href=\"Lothian%20Brigade\"&gt;Lothian Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Wales%20Brigade\"&gt;South Wales Brigade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe brigade &lt;a href=\"Headquarters%20%28military%29\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; was at &lt;a href=\"Dundee\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt; and, as the name would suggest, it was organized with four battalions of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Watch%20%28Royal%20Highlanders%29\"&gt;Black Watch (Royal Highlanders)&lt;/a&gt;:\n5th (&lt;a href=\"Renfrewshire%20%28historic%29\"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt;) Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Louise%27s%20%28Argyll%20and%20Sutherland%20Highlanders%29\"&gt;Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Greenock\"&gt;Greenock&lt;/a&gt; was attached. The brigade was assigned to Scottish Coast Defences in &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Command\"&gt;Scottish Command&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War I.\nIn accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907\"&gt;Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907&lt;/a&gt; (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force\"&gt;Territorial Force&lt;/a&gt; into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Force%20Imperial%20Service%20Badge\"&gt;Imperial Service&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Accordingly, the &lt;a href=\"2/1st%20Black%20Watch%20Brigade\"&gt;2/1st Black Watch Brigade&lt;/a&gt; was formed as a duplicate formation in January 1915.\nOn mobilization, the brigade took up its wartime stations in accordance with pre-war plans: 1/4th Black Watch at &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Buddon%20Training%20Area\"&gt;Buddon&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Carnoustie\"&gt;Carnoustie&lt;/a&gt;, 1/5th at &lt;a href=\"Broughty%20Ferry\"&gt;Broughty Ferry&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"River%20Tay\"&gt;Tay&lt;/a&gt; Defences, 1/6th at &lt;a href=\"North%20Queensferry\"&gt;Queensferry&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"River%20Forth\"&gt;Forth&lt;/a&gt; Defences, 1/7th at &lt;a href=\"Kinghorn\"&gt;Kinghorn&lt;/a&gt; also on Forth Defences; 1/5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was also on Scottish Coast Defences.\nThe brigade did not remain in existence for very much longer as the battalions were posted away. In October, the 1/5th Black Watch left for the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"24th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;24th Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"8th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;8th Division&lt;/a&gt; on 13 November. It was followed to France in February 1915 by the 1/4th Black Watch which joined the &lt;a href=\"21st%20%28Bareilly%29%20Brigade\"&gt;21st (Bareilly) Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"7th%20%28Meerut%29%20Division\"&gt;7th (Meerut) Division&lt;/a&gt; on 4 March 1915. On 16 April 1915, the 1/6th and 1/7th Black Watch departed for the &lt;a href=\"51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division\"&gt;51st (Highland) Division&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"153rd%20%282nd%20Highland%29%20Brigade\"&gt;153rd (2nd Highland) Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bedford\"&gt;Bedford&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the 1/5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders joined the &lt;a href=\"157th%20%28Highland%20Light%20Infantry%29%20Brigade\"&gt;157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"52nd%20%28Lowland%29%20Division\"&gt;52nd (Lowland) Division&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline\"&gt;Dunfermline&lt;/a&gt; on 24 April 1915. With that, the brigade passed out of existence."
