    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Oceania%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;OFC&lt;/a&gt; qualification play-off was a &lt;a href=\"Two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged&lt;/a&gt; home-and-away tie between the winners of the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28OFC%29\"&gt;Oceania qualifying tournament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the losing team in the AFC play-off from the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;Asian qualifying tournament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The games were played on 22 and 29 November 1997 in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Australia was hoping to play in the FIFA World Cup for the first time since &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt; and Iran in &lt;a href=\"1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlay-off match.\nFirst leg.\nPrior to arrival in Tehran, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Venables\"&gt;Terry Venables&lt;/a&gt; and others involved in the Australian national team had made negative comments about Iran, stating it as being dangerous, and going so far as to bring their own drinking water for their stay.\nThe first leg of the play-off, on 22 November 1997, took place in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, with the result a 1\u20131 draw. Attendance for this match was extremely high, as 128,000 fans packed &lt;a href=\"Azadi%20Stadium\"&gt;Azadi Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, despite it only having a capacity for 100,000 fans at the time.\nSecond leg.\nThe second leg, held on 29 November at the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;, had a crowd of 85,022. With Australia holding a 1\u20130 lead at half-time and scoring a second goal just after the break, it looked likely that they would progress to the World Cup. Immediately following Australia's second goal, spectator &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hore\"&gt;Peter Hore&lt;/a&gt;, known for disrupting major events, ran onto the field and cut up Iran's goal net, causing a halt in play. However, Australia's dominance continued until a controversial booking of &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Kewell\"&gt;Harry Kewell&lt;/a&gt; following a collision with Iranian goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Reza%20Abedzadeh\"&gt;Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh&lt;/a&gt; in the 72nd minute. This seemed to quell the Australians' momentum, as an Iranian revival, led by &lt;a href=\"Khodadad%20Azizi\"&gt;Khodadad Azizi&lt;/a&gt;, saw Iran score two quick goals to make the score 3\u20133 on aggregate, with Iran progressing on away goals. \nDespite being undefeated throughout their entire qualifying campaign, Australia had again failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Along with host nation and eventual winner &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (who as host nation did not need to qualify), and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Saint Kitts and Nevis&lt;/a&gt;, Australia were one of three teams to not lose a game in the entire campaign. The broadcast of the game on &lt;a href=\"Special%20Broadcasting%20Service\"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; featured closing comments from a clearly distraught &lt;a href=\"Les%20Murray%20%28broadcaster%29\"&gt;Les Murray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Warren\"&gt;Johnny Warren&lt;/a&gt;, with Warren openly weeping on air. In 2000, coach &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Venables\"&gt;Terry Venables&lt;/a&gt; said the game was \"one of the saddest sporting moments of my life.\""
