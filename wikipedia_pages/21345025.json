    "title": "Suspension from the UK parliament",
    "text": "In the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MPs) can be suspended from sitting in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; for \"disorderly conduct\".\nThe Speaker can order an MP removed from the house until the end of the day, but more often \"&lt;a href=\"Naming%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29\"&gt;names&lt;/a&gt;\" an MP.\nWhen an MP is named, a vote is held in the house in the same way as a normal vote on legislation. If the vote is successful, the MP named is suspended for five days for a first offence and 20 days for a second offence, during which time they cannot take part in votes and debates in Parliament. They also have their pay suspended.\nMembers of the House of Lords can also be suspended. This occurred for the first time since 1642 in May 2009, when Labour peers &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Truscott\"&gt;Lord Truscott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Taylor%20of%20Blackburn\"&gt;Lord Taylor of Blackburn&lt;/a&gt; were suspended after a newspaper accused them of offering to change laws for cash. It was followed by the suspension of three more peers in October 2010, when &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Uddin\"&gt;Baroness Uddin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Paul\"&gt;Lord Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bhatia\"&gt;Lord Bhatia&lt;/a&gt; were suspended following the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20parliamentary%20expenses%20scandal\"&gt;Parliamentary expenses scandal&lt;/a&gt;."
