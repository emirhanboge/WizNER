    "text": "Gustaf Erik Hasselgren (15 November 1781 \u2014 9 March 1827) was a Swedish painter and &lt;a href=\"etcher\"&gt;etcher&lt;/a&gt;. He specialized in Biblical and historical subjects.\nBiography.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Erik Gustaf Hasselgren, was the local head of the security guard; a position akin to police chief. From 1798, he studied with &lt;a href=\"Pehr%20Hillestr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Pehr Hillestr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;, where his works, largely historical in nature, were awarded several medals, including the Academy's first silver medal in 1803. He became an agr\u00e9 (a type of member-candidate) in 1804 and received a major travel scholarship in 1806. \nHe first went to Berlin, where he stayed for a year, but was not able to accomplish much, due to an illness. This was followed by three years in &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; and one year in Vienna, before he settled in Italy. He remained there for five years; becoming associated with the German art colony and befriending &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Friedrich%20Overbeck\"&gt;Johann Friedrich Overbeck&lt;/a&gt;, one of the major figures in the &lt;a href=\"Nazarene%20movement\"&gt;Nazarene movement&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring his travels (in 1812), he had been named a full member of the Academy. In 1816, he returned to Sweden to succeed Hillestr\u00f6m as Professor of figure painting. The following year, he married the artist . \nHis larger works include a \"Resurrection of Christ\", which is in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20James%27s%20Church%2C%20Stockholm\"&gt;Saint James's Church, Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, and a depiction of \"&lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20Lodbrok\"&gt;Ragnar Lodbrok&lt;/a&gt;\", which was commissioned by King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XIV%20John\"&gt;Karl XIV Johan&lt;/a&gt;. His works may also be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Nationalmuseum\"&gt;Nationalmuseum&lt;/a&gt; and the .\nHasselgren died in Stockholm on 9 March 1827."
