    "text": "A Coru\u00f1a (, ) is one of the four constituencies () represented in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Galicia\"&gt;Parliament of Galicia&lt;/a&gt;, the regional legislature of the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain\"&gt;autonomous community&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;. The constituency currently elects 25 &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20%28legislator%29\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt;. Its boundaries correspond to those of the Spanish &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20A%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;province of A Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"electoral%20system\"&gt;electoral system&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Closed%20list\"&gt;closed-list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with a minimum threshold of five percent.\nElectoral system.\nThe constituency was created as per the &lt;a href=\"Galician%20Statute%20of%20Autonomy%20of%201981\"&gt;Statute of Autonomy for Galicia of 1981&lt;/a&gt; and was first contested in the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Galician%20regional%20election\"&gt;1981 regional election&lt;/a&gt;. The Statute provided for the four &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20A%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;A Coru\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Lugo\"&gt;Lugo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Ourense\"&gt;Ourense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pontevedra\"&gt;Pontevedra&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to be established as multi-member districts in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Galicia\"&gt;Parliament of Galicia&lt;/a&gt;, with this regulation being maintained under the 1985 regional electoral law. Each constituency is entitled to an initial minimum of 10 seats, with the remaining 35 being distributed in proportion to their populations. In the 1981 and 1985 elections, each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 22 for A Coru\u00f1a, 15 for Lugo, 15 for Ourense and 19 for Pontevedra.\nVoting is on the basis of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Galicia and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Amendments to the electoral law in 2011 required for &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20diaspora\"&gt;Galicians abroad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Voter%20registration\"&gt;apply for voting&lt;/a&gt; before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). Seats are elected using the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"closed%20list\"&gt;closed list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with an &lt;a href=\"electoral%20threshold\"&gt;electoral threshold&lt;/a&gt; of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots; until a 1993 reform, the threshold was set at three percent\u2014being applied in each constituency. The use of the D'Hondt method may result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the &lt;a href=\"district%20magnitude\"&gt;district magnitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe electoral law allows for &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Political%20alliance\"&gt;federations&lt;/a&gt; registered in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;coalitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grouping%20of%20electors%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;groupings of electors&lt;/a&gt; to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call\u2014fifteen before 1985\u2014whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election\u2014one-thousandth of the electorate, with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures, until 1985\u2014disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates."
