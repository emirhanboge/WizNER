    "text": "Willem de Waal (born 17 February 1978 in &lt;a href=\"Paarl\"&gt;Paarl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;) is a South African &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer who is currently playing for &lt;a href=\"Benetton%20Rugby\"&gt;Benetton Treviso&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pro14\"&gt;Pro14&lt;/a&gt; competition. He plays in the position of fly-half. Like &lt;a href=\"Joost%20van%20der%20Westhuizen\"&gt;Joost van der Westhuizen&lt;/a&gt; at scrum-half, de Waal is unusually big for a fly-half.\nCareer.\nDe Waal played rugby for &lt;a href=\"Stellenbosch%20University\"&gt;Stellenbosch University&lt;/a&gt; before making his provincial debut with the &lt;a href=\"Leopards%20%28rugby%20team%29\"&gt;Leopards&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. He then moved to the &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20Cheetahs\"&gt;Free State Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 where he would experience his greatest success so far. In each of his four seasons at the club, the Cheetahs made it to the final of the &lt;a href=\"Currie%20Cup\"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt;, winning twice and sharing one.\nDe Waal has also played at &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; level, making his debut with the &lt;a href=\"Bulls%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 before joining the &lt;a href=\"Cats%20%28rugby%20club%29\"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. When the competition expanded to 14 teams in &lt;a href=\"2006%20Super%2014%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, the Cats split into two separate franchises \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Lions%20%28Super%20rugby%20franchise%29\"&gt;Lions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cheetahs%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt;, which de Waal joined.\nOn 24 July 2007, it was announced that de Waal signed a two-year deal with French &lt;a href=\"Pro%20D2\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"RC%20Narbonne\"&gt;RC Narbonne&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; after one season and secured a spot in the 2009 &lt;a href=\"Stormers\"&gt;Stormers&lt;/a&gt; squad, his fourth different super rugby team. He also played in the Currie Cup for &lt;a href=\"Western%20Province%20%28rugby%20team%29\"&gt;Western Province&lt;/a&gt; that same season."
