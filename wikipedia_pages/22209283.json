    "text": "Cleobury North is a &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; and small village in south east &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is situated on the B4364 southwest of the &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;market town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bridgnorth\"&gt;Bridgnorth&lt;/a&gt;. To the north is the village of &lt;a href=\"Ditton%20Priors\"&gt;Ditton Priors&lt;/a&gt; and to the west is &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Clee%20Hill\"&gt;Brown Clee Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the county's highest hill.\nThe Village.\nCleobury North is a parish along the River Rea, under the Clee Hills and is 8 miles S.W of &lt;a href=\"Bridgnorth\"&gt;Bridgnorth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSt. Peter and St Paul\u2019s church dates back to the late 12th century, which is a Grade II* listed building (Listing NGR: SO6232087002). Grade II* buildings are of particular special interest with only 5.5% listed as Grade II* in England.\nThe local bus services are 141 and 143 runs through Cleobury North from &lt;a href=\"Bridgnorth\"&gt;Bridgnorth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ludlow\"&gt;Ludlow&lt;/a&gt; along the B4364, Monday-Saturday.\nThe nearest railway station to Cleobury North is the &lt;a href=\"Ludlow\"&gt;Ludlow&lt;/a&gt; railway station which is 9.97 miles away.\nHistory.\nDomesday Book\nThe &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; was a survey for &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;William I&lt;/a&gt; which showed who owned what, how much everything was worth and how much the King was owed in tax and rent. The survey showed that Cleobury North had a total population of 9 households with only 2.5 geld of taxable units. The value in 1066 was \u00a30.60 and increased in 1086 to \u00a31, the amount was extremely low as the village only consisted of 4 villagers, 4 smallholders and 1 slave.\nHearth Tax\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hearth%20Tax\"&gt;Hearth Tax&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in England in 1662. Records of the Hearth Tax in Cleobury North date back to 1672 which was calculated on the number of fireplaces in a family unit. The records show that 26 households paid in Cleobury North (e.g. Hercules Hide, David Jones and Richard Hudson) and 3 were illegible (Nicholas Millichopp, Thomas Kindsley Esq. and Robert Grove).\nPopulation change \nCleobury North had a population of 136 residents in 1801, which increased to 250 in 1911. In 1911 it was at a record high but dwellers started to decrease and ended up with 110 in 1961. The current day population is 87 people which shows it has declined overall throughout the years and has a net negative correlation.\nOccupation History\nDuring the year of 1831 the highest sector of employment in males 20 years and over was agricultural labour with 20 residents. This was over 44% of the parish males. Other occupation included retail, handicraft and non-agricultural labour with 7 males, and no males were in manufacturing.\nActivities.\nBurwarton Show-\nThe Burwarton show is a one-day agricultural show which attracts over 20,000 visitors each year on the first Thursday in August between 8:15am-7pm. Activities include sheep ring, fleece competition and sheep shearing competition. The annual dance which starts the show brought in \u00a38,000 in 2011 which raises money for charities which include the Air Ambulance, &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Nurses\"&gt;Nightingale Nurses&lt;/a&gt; and Breast Cancer.\nFootball-\nBrown Clee FC are a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the village, who currently play in Division One of the &lt;a href=\"Mercian%20Regional%20Football%20League\"&gt;Mercian Regional Football League&lt;/a&gt;. They play their home games at the Hall Meadow football field. The grounds of several teams in the league, most notably Brown Clee, were featured in David Bauckham's book \"Dugouts\", which noted the high frequency of dugouts with lockable doors which are also used for storage, a feature seemingly unique to clubs in Shropshire.\nCensus.\nAt the 2011 census, the village was included in the &lt;a href=\"Burwarton\"&gt;Burwarton&lt;/a&gt; civil parish."
