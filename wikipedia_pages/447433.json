    "text": "Capitol Reef National Park is an American &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in south-central &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The park is approximately long on its northsouth axis and just wide on average. The park was established in 1971 to preserve of desert landscape and is open all year, with May through September being the highest visitation months.\nPartially in &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Wayne County, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, the area was originally named \"Wayne Wonderland\" in the 1920s by local &lt;a href=\"Boosterism\"&gt;boosters&lt;/a&gt; Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman. Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area's colorful canyons, ridges, &lt;a href=\"butte\"&gt;butte&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"monoliths\"&gt;monoliths&lt;/a&gt;; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public. Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Route%2024\"&gt;State Route 24&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Fremont%20River%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;Fremont River&lt;/a&gt; Canyon.\nThe majority of the nearly long up-thrust formation called the &lt;a href=\"Waterpocket%20Fold\"&gt;Waterpocket Fold&lt;/a&gt;a rocky &lt;a href=\"Fold%20%28geology%29\"&gt;spine&lt;/a&gt; extending from &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Lake%20Mountain\"&gt;Thousand Lake Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Powell\"&gt;Lake Powell&lt;/a&gt;is preserved within the park. Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River. The park was named for its whitish &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20Sandstone\"&gt;Navajo Sandstone&lt;/a&gt; cliffs with &lt;a href=\"dome\"&gt;dome&lt;/a&gt; formationssimilar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildingsthat run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. Locally, \"reef\" refers to any rocky barrier to land travel, just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel.\nGeography.\nCapitol Reef encompasses the &lt;a href=\"Waterpocket%20Fold\"&gt;Waterpocket Fold&lt;/a&gt;, a warp in the &lt;a href=\"Earth%23Crust\"&gt;earth's crust&lt;/a&gt; that is 65\u00a0million years old. It is the largest exposed &lt;a href=\"monocline\"&gt;monocline&lt;/a&gt; in North America. In this fold, newer and older layers of earth folded over each other in an S-shape. This warp, probably caused by the same colliding &lt;a href=\"plate%20tectonics\"&gt;continental plates&lt;/a&gt; that created the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountains\"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, has weathered and &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;eroded&lt;/a&gt; over millennia to expose layers of rock and &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s. The park is filled with brilliantly colored &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; cliffs, gleaming white domes, and contrasting layers of stone and earth.\nThe area was named for a line of white &lt;a href=\"dome\"&gt;dome&lt;/a&gt;s and cliffs of Navajo Sandstone, each of which looks somewhat like the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Capitol\"&gt;United States Capitol&lt;/a&gt; building, that run from the &lt;a href=\"Fremont%20River%20%28Utah%29\"&gt;Fremont River&lt;/a&gt; to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold.\nThe fold forms a north-to-south barrier that has barely been breached by roads. Early settlers referred to parallel impassable ridges as \"reefs\", from which the park gets the second half of its name. The first paved road was constructed through the area in 1962. &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Route%2024\"&gt;State Route 24&lt;/a&gt; cuts through the park traveling east and west between &lt;a href=\"Canyonlands%20National%20Park\"&gt;Canyonlands National Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Canyon%20National%20Park\"&gt;Bryce Canyon National Park&lt;/a&gt;, but few other paved roads invade the rugged landscape.\nThe park is filled with canyons, cliffs, towers, domes, and arches. The Fremont River has cut canyons through parts of the Waterpocket Fold, but most of the park is arid desert. A scenic drive shows park visitors some highlights, but it runs only a few miles from the main highway. Hundreds of miles of trails and unpaved roads lead into the equally scenic backcountry.\nHistory.\nNative Americans and Mormons.\n&lt;a href=\"Fremont%20people\"&gt;Fremont&lt;/a&gt;-culture Native Americans lived near the perennial Fremont River in the northern part of the Capitol Reef Waterpocket Fold around the year 1000. They &lt;a href=\"irrigation\"&gt;irrigated&lt;/a&gt; crops of maize and &lt;a href=\"squash%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt; and stored their &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt; in stone granaries (in part made from the numerous black &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; boulders that litter the area). In the 13th century, all of the Native American cultures in this area underwent sudden change, likely due to a long drought. The Fremont settlements and fields were abandoned.\nMany years after the Fremont left, &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Paiute\"&gt;Paiute&lt;/a&gt;s moved into the area. These &lt;a href=\"Numic%20languages\"&gt;Numic&lt;/a&gt;-speaking people named the Fremont granaries \"moki huts\" and thought they were the homes of a race of tiny people or \"moki\".\nIn 1872 &lt;a href=\"Almon%20Harris%20Thompson\"&gt;Almon H. Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, a geographer attached to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; Major &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley%20Powell\"&gt;John Wesley Powell&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition, crossed the Waterpocket Fold while exploring the area. Geologist &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Dutton\"&gt;Clarence Dutton&lt;/a&gt; later spent several summers studying the area's geology. None of these expeditions explored the Waterpocket Fold to any great extent.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, officials of &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; sought to establish &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28Christian%29\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in the remotest niches of the &lt;a href=\"Intermountain%20West\"&gt;Intermountain West&lt;/a&gt;. In 1866, a quasi-military expedition of Mormons in pursuit of natives penetrated the high valleys to the west. In the 1870s, settlers moved into these valleys, eventually establishing &lt;a href=\"Loa%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fremont%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Fremont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyman%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Lyman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bicknell%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Bicknell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torrey%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Torrey&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mormons\"&gt;Mormons&lt;/a&gt; settled the &lt;a href=\"Fremont%20River%20valley\"&gt;Fremont River valley&lt;/a&gt; in the 1880s and established Junction (later renamed &lt;a href=\"Fruita%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Fruita&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Caineville%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Caineville&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aldridge%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Aldridge&lt;/a&gt;. Fruita prospered, Caineville barely survived, and Aldridge died. In addition to farming, &lt;a href=\"Lime%20%28mineral%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt; was extracted from local &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; was extracted early in the 20th century. In 1904 the first claim to a uranium mine in the area was staked. The resulting Oyler Mine in Grand Wash produced uranium ore.\nBy 1920 no more than ten families at one time were sustained by the fertile flood plain of the Fremont River and the land changed ownership over the years. The area remained isolated. The community was later abandoned and later still some buildings were restored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Park%20Service\"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kiln\"&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt;s once used to produce lime are still in Sulphur Creek and near the campgrounds on Scenic Drive.\nEarly protection efforts.\nLocal &lt;a href=\"Ephraim%20Portman%20Pectol\"&gt;Ephraim Portman Pectol&lt;/a&gt; organized a \"&lt;a href=\"booster%20club\"&gt;booster club&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Torrey%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Torrey&lt;/a&gt; in 1921. Pectol pressed a promotional campaign, furnishing stories to be sent to periodicals and newspapers. In his efforts, he was increasingly aided by his brother-in-law, Joseph S. Hickman, who was the Wayne County High School principal. In 1924, Hickman extended community involvement in the promotional effort by organizing a Wayne County-wide Wayne Wonderland Club. That same year, Hickman was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;Utah State Legislature&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1933, Pectol was elected to the presidency of the Associated Civics Club of Southern Utah, successor to the Wayne Wonderland Club. The club raised U.S. $150 () to interest a Salt Lake City photographer in taking a series of promotional photographs. For several years, the photographer, J.\u00a0E. Broaddus, traveled and lectured on \"Wayne Wonderland\".\nIn 1933, Pectol was elected to the legislature and almost immediately contacted President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; and asked for the creation of \"Wayne Wonderland National Monument\" out of the federal lands comprising the bulk of the Capitol Reef area. Federal agencies began a feasibility study and boundary assessment. Meanwhile, Pectol guided the government investigators on numerous trips and escorted an increasing number of visitors. The lectures of Broaddus were having an effect.\nRoosevelt signed a proclamation creating Capitol Reef National Monument on August 2, 1937. In Proclamation 2246, President Roosevelt set aside of the Capitol Reef area. This comprised an area extending about north of present &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Route%2024\"&gt;State Route 24&lt;/a&gt; and about south, just past Capitol Gorge. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; years were lean ones for the National Park Service (NPS), the new administering agency. Funds for the administration of Capitol Reef were nonexistent; it would be a long time before the first rangers would arrive.\nAdministration of the monument.\nAdministration of the new monument was placed under the control of &lt;a href=\"Zion%20National%20Park\"&gt;Zion National Park&lt;/a&gt;. A stone ranger cabin and the Sulphur Creek bridge were built and some road work was performed by the &lt;a href=\"Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps\"&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;Works Progress Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Historian and printer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Kelly%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Charles Kelly&lt;/a&gt; came to know NPS officials at Zion well and volunteered to watchdog the park for the NPS. Kelly was officially appointed custodian-without-pay in 1943. He worked as a volunteer until 1950, when the NPS offered him a civil-service appointment as the first superintendent.\nDuring the 1950s Kelly was deeply troubled by NPS management acceding to demands of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission\"&gt;U.S. Atomic Energy Commission&lt;/a&gt; that Capitol Reef National Monument be opened to &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; prospecting. He felt that the decision had been a mistake and destructive of the long-term national interest. It turned out that there was not enough ore in the monument to be worth mining.\nIn 1958 Kelly got additional permanent help in protecting the monument and enforcing regulations; Park Ranger Grant Clark transferred from Zion. The year Clark arrived, fifty-six\u00a0thousand visitors came to the park, and Charlie Kelly retired for the last time.\nDuring the 1960s (under the program name &lt;a href=\"Mission%2066\"&gt;Mission 66&lt;/a&gt;), NPS areas nationwide received new facilities to meet the demand of mushrooming park visitation. At Capitol Reef, a 53-site campground at Fruita, staff rental housing, and a new visitor center were built, the latter opening in 1966.\nVisitation climbed dramatically after the paved, all-weather &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Route%2024\"&gt;State Route 24&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1962 through the Fremont River canyon near Fruita. State Route 24 replaced the narrow Capitol Gorge wagon road about to the south that frequently washed out. The old road has since been open only to foot traffic. In 1967, 146,598 persons visited the park. The staff was also growing.\nDuring the 1960s, the NPS purchased private land parcels at Fruita and Pleasant Creek. Almost all private property passed into public ownership on a \"willing buyer-willing seller\" basis.\nPreservationists convinced President &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; to set aside an enormous area of public lands in 1968, just before he left office. In Presidential Proclamation 3888 an additional were placed under NPS control. By 1970, Capitol Reef National Monument comprised and sprawled southeast from &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Lake%20Mountain\"&gt;Thousand Lake Mountain&lt;/a&gt; almost to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River%20%28US%29\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;. The action was controversial locally, and NPS staffing at the monument was inadequate to properly manage the additional land.\nNational park status.\nThe vast enlargement of the monument and diversification of the scenic resources soon raised another issue: whether Capitol Reef should be a &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20National%20Monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt;. Two bills were introduced into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nA House bill (H.R. 17152) introduced by &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; Congressman &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20J.%20Burton\"&gt;Laurence J. Burton&lt;/a&gt; called for a national park and an adjunct &lt;a href=\"national%20recreation%20area\"&gt;national recreation area&lt;/a&gt; where multiple use (including &lt;a href=\"grazing\"&gt;grazing&lt;/a&gt;) could continue indefinitely. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, Senate bill S. 531 had already passed on July 1, 1970, and provided for a national park alone. The bill called for a 25-year phase-out of grazing.\nIn September 1970, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Interior\"&gt;United States Department of Interior&lt;/a&gt; officials told a house subcommittee session that they preferred about be set aside as a national park. They also recommended that the grazing phase-out period be 10 years, rather than 25. They did not favor the adjunct recreation area.\nIt was not until late 1971 that Congressional action was completed. By then, the &lt;a href=\"92nd%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;92nd United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; was in session and S. 531 had languished. A new bill, S. 29, was introduced in the Senate by Senator &lt;a href=\"Frank%20E.%20Moss\"&gt;Frank E. Moss&lt;/a&gt; of Utah and was essentially the same as the defunct S. 531 except that it called for an additional of public lands for a Capitol Reef National Park. In the House, Utah Representative &lt;a href=\"K.%20Gunn%20McKay\"&gt;K. Gunn McKay&lt;/a&gt; (with Representative Lloyd) had introduced H.R. 9053 to replace the dead H.R. 17152. This time, the House bill dropped the concept of an adjunct Capitol Reef National Recreation Area and adopted the Senate concept of a 25-year limit on continued grazing. The Department of Interior was still recommending a national park of and a 10-year limit for grazing phase-out.\nS. 29 passed the Senate in June and was sent to the House. The House subsequently dropped its own bill and passed the Senate version with an amendment. Because the Senate was not in agreement with the House amendment, differences were worked out in &lt;a href=\"Conference%20Committee\"&gt;Conference Committee&lt;/a&gt;. The Conference Committee issued their agreeing report on November 30, 1971. The legislation\u2014'An Act to Establish The Capitol Reef National Park in the State of Utah'\u2014became Public Law 92-207 when it was signed by President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; on December 18, 1971.\nClimate.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; system, the Capitol Reef Visitor Center has a &lt;a href=\"cold%20semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;cold semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"BSk\").\nGeology.\nThe area including the park was once the edge of a shallow sea that invaded the land in the &lt;a href=\"Permian\"&gt;Permian&lt;/a&gt;, creating the &lt;a href=\"Cutler%20Formation\"&gt;Cutler Formation&lt;/a&gt;. Only the &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; of the youngest member of the Cutler Formation, the White Rim, is exposed in the park. The deepening sea left &lt;a href=\"carbonate\"&gt;carbonate&lt;/a&gt; deposits, forming the &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kaibab%20Limestone\"&gt;Kaibab Limestone&lt;/a&gt;, the same formation that rims the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Canyon\"&gt;Grand Canyon&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Triassic\"&gt;Triassic&lt;/a&gt;, streams deposited reddish-brown &lt;a href=\"silt\"&gt;silt&lt;/a&gt; that later became the &lt;a href=\"siltstone\"&gt;siltstone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moenkopi%20Formation\"&gt;Moenkopi Formation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tectonic%20uplift\"&gt;Uplift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; followed. &lt;a href=\"Conglomerate%20%28geology%29\"&gt;Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;, followed by logs, sand, mud, and wind-transported &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20ash\"&gt;volcanic ash&lt;/a&gt;, then formed the &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;-containing Chinle Formation.\nThe members of the &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Canyon%20Group\"&gt;Glen Canyon Group&lt;/a&gt; were all laid down in the middle- to late-Triassic during a time of increasing aridity. They include:\nThe San Rafael Group consists of four Jurassic-period formations, from oldest to youngest:\nStreams once again laid down mud and sand in their channels, on lakebeds, and in &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;y plains, creating the &lt;a href=\"Morrison%20Formation\"&gt;Morrison Formation&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt;, similar nonmarine sediments were laid down and became the Dakota Sandstone. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous%20Seaway\"&gt;Cretaceous Seaway&lt;/a&gt; covered the Dakota, depositing the Mancos Shale.\nOnly small remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Mesaverde%20Group\"&gt;Mesaverde Group&lt;/a&gt; are found, capping a few &lt;a href=\"mesa\"&gt;mesa&lt;/a&gt;s in the park's eastern section.\nNear the end of the Cretaceous period, a mountain-building event called the &lt;a href=\"Laramide%20orogeny\"&gt;Laramide orogeny&lt;/a&gt; started to compact and uplift the region, forming the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mountain\"&gt;Rocky Mountain&lt;/a&gt;s and creating &lt;a href=\"monocline\"&gt;monocline&lt;/a&gt;s such as the Waterpocket Fold in the park. Ten to fifteen\u00a0million years ago, the entire region was uplifted much further by the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Plateau\"&gt;Colorado Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. This uplift was very even. &lt;a href=\"Igneous%20rock\"&gt;Igneous&lt;/a&gt; activity in the form of &lt;a href=\"volcanism\"&gt;volcanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dike%20%28geology%29\"&gt;dike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sill%20%28geology%29\"&gt;sill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"intrusion%20%28geology%29\"&gt;intrusion&lt;/a&gt; also occurred during this time.\nThe drainage system in the area was rearranged and steepened, causing streams to &lt;a href=\"downcutting\"&gt;downcut&lt;/a&gt; faster and sometimes change course. Wetter times during the &lt;a href=\"ice%20age\"&gt;ice age&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; increased the rate of erosion.\nVisiting the park.\nThe closest town to Capitol Reef is &lt;a href=\"Torrey%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Torrey&lt;/a&gt;, about west of the visitor center on Highway 24, slightly west of its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Utah%20State%20Route%2012\"&gt;Highway 12&lt;/a&gt;. Its 2020 population is less than 300. Torrey has a few motels and restaurants and functions as a gateway town to Capitol Reef National Park. Highway 12, as well as a partially unpaved scenic backway named the Burr Trail, provide access from the west through the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Staircase-Escalante%20National%20Monument\"&gt;Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Boulder%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Boulder&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivities.\nA variety of activities are available to tourists, both ranger-led and self-guided, including auto touring, hiking, backpacking, camping, bicycling (on paved and unpaved roads only; no trails), horseback riding, canyoneering, and rock climbing. The orchards planted by Mormon pioneers are maintained by the National Park Service. From early March to mid-October, various fruit\u2014cherries, apricots, peaches, pears, or apples\u2014can be harvested by visitors for a fee.\nHiking and backpacking.\nA hiking trail guide is available at the visitor center for both day hikes and backcountry hiking. Backcountry access requires a free permit.\nNumerous trails are available for hiking and backpacking in the park, with fifteen in the Fruita District alone. The following trails are some of the most popular in the park:\nAuto touring.\nVisitors may explore several of the main areas of the park by private vehicle:\nCamping.\nThe primary camping location is the Fruita campground, with 71 campsites (no water, electrical, or sewer hookups), and restrooms without bathing facilities. The campground also has group sites with picnic areas and restrooms. Two primitive free camping areas are also available."
