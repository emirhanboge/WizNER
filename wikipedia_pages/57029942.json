The film was released on 1 March 2019 in 940 screens worldwide, with 720 screens in India and 220 in overseas regions. The film received positive reviews from critics. Its dialogues are entirely in the &lt;a href=\"Bundeli%20language\"&gt;Bundeli dialect&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nSet in the ravines of the &lt;a href=\"Chambal%20River\"&gt;Chambal&lt;/a&gt; valley, the film tells the tale of dacoits in 1975, who termed themselves Baaghis, the rebels.\nLacchu gives information to the Baaghis that a dowry of tons of gold and cash will be given to the bride by her father so &lt;a href=\"Dacoit\"&gt;Dacoit&lt;/a&gt; Maan Singh a.k.a 'Dadda' should raid it. Special Task Force (STF) headed by Inspector Virendra Singh Gujjar attacks them during the loot in which Dadda gets killed. This leads to a split between the gang. Lakhna wants to surrender to the police, while Vakil Singh wants to follow Baaghi's dharm (way of life) of rebellion.\nOn the run, they meet Thakur's wife Indumati Tomar with a girl named Sonchiriya a.k.a 'Lalli' whom Indumati's family head had raped. Indumati had killed him to save Sonchiriya and ran away to rescue her and take her to hospital. Indumati's whole family wants to have her killed. She pleads with Baaghis to help her take Sonchiriya to the hospital. Baaghis agree.\nIndumati's family arrives and tries to take away Khushi with them. At the same time, Vakil Singh agrees to let her go. Lakhna revolts and disagrees. In this melee, Indumati's own child accidentally kills Vakil's brother. Lakhna and the team, along with Indumati and Sonchiriya, escape and Vakil Singh vows to hunt them down and kill them all. It is revealed that Maan Singh looted the dowry house to save Lacchu's father from inspector Gujjar knowing very well that it was a trap to kill them. Gujjar had taken him hostage and promised to free him only if Lacchu brings Baaghis to that village for the police to kill all Baaghis at once and get the reward from the government.\nMidway to the hospital, Lakhna tells Indumati a background story about a curse of killing innocent children inside a room by mistake which led to the Baaghis' whole group being killed one by one. They need to find Sonchiriya (a metaphor for a 'Saviour Girl') to get rid of the curse. Baaghis meet Dacoit &lt;a href=\"Phoolan%20Devi\"&gt;Phuilya&lt;/a&gt;, and she joins Lakhna to save the girl and take them to &lt;a href=\"Dholpur\"&gt;Dholpur&lt;/a&gt; Hospital. They are joined again by Vakil Singh and the gang in the task. Vakil says, \"to ward off the curse we need to save this girl from death. It is a chance to repent, this girl is \"our Sonchiraiya, our saviour\". Indumati's son wants to kill his mother, but Lakhna confronts and tells the truth that his grandfather was his biological father. Lakhna and Indumati make it to the hospital.\nWhile the girl is being hospitalized, Lakhna, who, being chased by Gujjar, was hiding behind the tree, comes out to surrender as his task of saving Sonchiriya was finished. But by the curse, Lakhna is shot dead by Gujjar.\nIn the aftermath, it is revealed that Vakil Singh has actually been killed by the police at the railway station, as his corpse is loaded in a tractor. Later, while traveling towards the police station after killing Lakhna, Gujjar is shot and killed by one of his Thakur constable whose uncle (another constable with him in his gypsy) was earlier assaulted and insulted by him.\nCast.\n.Vijay Kumar Dogra as Dr. Bhadauria\nProduction.\nThe principal photography for the film began on 19 January 2018 in Chambal.
