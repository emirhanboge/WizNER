    "text": "Dieter Wolfgang B\u00fcttner (born 24 February 1949) as a retired &lt;a href=\"West%20German\"&gt;West German&lt;/a&gt; hurdler who competed in the 400 m event at the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1972 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. In the semifinals he tumbled over &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Rudolph\"&gt;Christian Rudolph&lt;/a&gt;, who had obstructed his path. The West German team launched a protest, but it was rejected because B\u00fcttner had no chance to reach the final anyway. B\u00fcttner held the German 400 m title in 1971 and 1972. After retiring from competitions he worked as a teacher of physical education, geography and &lt;a href=\"Evangelicalism\"&gt;Evangelicalism&lt;/a&gt;."
