    "text": "\"Someone Else Not Me\" is the 30th single by &lt;a href=\"Duran%20Duran\"&gt;Duran Duran&lt;/a&gt;, and the only single from the album \"&lt;a href=\"Pop%20Trash\"&gt;Pop Trash&lt;/a&gt;\". It charted at number 26 in Italy and number 53 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout the song.\nThe song is a melancholy &lt;a href=\"ballad\"&gt;ballad&lt;/a&gt;, and the only song on the \"Pop Trash\" album with lyrics actually written by vocalist &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Le%20Bon\"&gt;Simon Le Bon&lt;/a&gt;; the rest were composed by bandmates &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Rhodes\"&gt;Nick Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Cuccurullo\"&gt;Warren Cuccurullo&lt;/a&gt;. Live performances of this song on television shows and their 1999 and 2000\u20132001 tours featured a harder-edge, rock ballad style with much more prominent guitar.\nChart positions.\n\"Someone Else Not Me\" only reached number 53 in the United Kingdom, a disappointing placing considering most previous singles had hit the top 40. However, it made it to the top 30 in Italy, reaching number 26.\nMusic video.\nThe video was the first to be created entirely in &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20Flash\"&gt;Macromedia Flash&lt;/a&gt; animation, by web design firm &lt;a href=\"Fullerene%20Productions\"&gt;Fullerene Productions&lt;/a&gt; (who also created the band's Flash-based official &lt;a href=\"website\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;).\nB-sides, bonus tracks and remixes.\nAt Le Bon's request, the lyrics were translated into French and Spanish so he could record alternate versions, which were included as &lt;a href=\"bonus%20track\"&gt;bonus track&lt;/a&gt;s on various global releases:\nThe &lt;a href=\"b-side\"&gt;b-side&lt;/a&gt; was \"Starting to Remember\".\nTrack listing.\nCD: Hollywood / 0108845HWR (UK)\nCD: Hollywood / PRCD-11237-2 (USA)\nIn popular culture.\nThe song appeared in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Daria\"&gt;Daria&lt;/a&gt;\" TV movie \"&lt;a href=\"Is%20It%20Fall%20Yet%3F\"&gt;Is It Fall Yet?&lt;/a&gt;\" when Daria greets Quinn's tutor, David Sorenson, at the door."
