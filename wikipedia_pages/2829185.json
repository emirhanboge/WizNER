It has a population of around 10,000 and is located at the Polish-Czech border, just across from the Czech town of &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A1chod\"&gt;N\u00e1chod&lt;/a&gt;, some west of Polish &lt;a href=\"K%C5%82odzko\"&gt;K\u0142odzko&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;.\nKudowa-Zdr\u00f3j is one of the oldest European spa towns where heart and &lt;a href=\"circulatory%20system\"&gt;circulatory system&lt;/a&gt; diseases were cured. The downtown area features a park styled on 17th century revival, with exotic plants and a mineral water pump room. Due to its location, the town is famous for &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; and as the departure point for trips.\nThe town has several historical and heritage sites such as the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Chapel%2C%20Czermna\"&gt;Chapel of Skulls&lt;/a&gt; within the Czermna district of Kudowa, an &lt;a href=\"ossuary\"&gt;ossuary&lt;/a&gt; containing the bones or skeletal remains of thousands. It is one of six of its kind in Europe. Another site is the &lt;a href=\"Wambierzyce\"&gt;Basilica of Wambierzyce&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed \"Silesian Jerusalem\", and one of the most popular &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pilgrimage\"&gt;pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; destinations in Poland.\nHistory.\nKudowa-Zdr\u00f3j is one of the oldest spa resorts in Poland and Europe. It is first mentioned in a document by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20M%C3%BCnsterberg-Oels\"&gt;Henry the Elder&lt;/a&gt; (1448-1498), son of the &lt;a href=\"Hussite\"&gt;Hussite&lt;/a&gt; Czech king &lt;a href=\"George%20of%20Podebrady\"&gt;George of Podebrady&lt;/a&gt;. The original name of the village was Lipolitov but in the mid-16th century it was changed to Chudoba, later on Kudoba (Cudoba in the 19th century), Bad Kudowa and into Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j in 1945.\nThe oldest part of Kudowa is Czermna, dating back to the 16th century. The first record of a mineral waters in the area comes from 1580 from the chronicles of Louis of N\u00e1chod, under the name \"Cermenske Lazne\". In 1625 (or, as some sources say, as early as 1621), G. Aelurius, a Protestant &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; monk, wrote in his work \"Glaciografia\" about the great taste of the mineral waters from Kudowa.\nIn 1847, Kudowa was visited by 300 patients. In 1850, Adolf Duflos made a chemical analysis of the local waters and claimed they have healing traits. Local doctor J. Jacob helped to establish the notion that Kudowa is a spa that helps heart related diseases, which had a significant impact on the number of people visiting the town. In 1900, the number of people who visited was 4,150. \nOwing to the development of business and industry, a railway line to &lt;a href=\"K%C5%82odzko\"&gt;K\u0142odzko&lt;/a&gt; (then under the name \"Glatz\") and a local power plant grew in importance. \nIn 1891, German-American editor &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Raster\"&gt;Hermann Raster&lt;/a&gt; visited Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j due to failing health. He died there in July of that same year. \nIn 1920, the \"Gebr\u00fcder Martin und Paul Polka O.H.G.\" company bought the largest spa resort of the town. Famous visitors included &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; and \n&lt;a href=\"Helmut%20von%20Moltke\"&gt;Helmut von Moltke&lt;/a&gt;. From 1911 to 1931, &lt;a href=\"Raphael%20Friedeberg\"&gt;Raphael Friedeberg&lt;/a&gt; worked as a physician in the Spa.\nKudowa was part of &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; until 1742 when, together with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"county%20of%20Kladsko\"&gt;county of Kladsko&lt;/a&gt;, it passed to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. From 1818 until 1945, it was known as \"Bad Kudowa\", and was part of the Prussian &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Lower%20Silesia\"&gt;province of Lower Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany. In the &lt;a href=\"interbellum\"&gt;interbellum&lt;/a&gt;, the German administration renamed most district names to erase traces of &lt;a href=\"West%20Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; origin, only the district of Zakrze (then under the Germanized name \"Sackisch\") retained its name, despite also being of Slavic origin.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the Germans established and operated a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20subcamps%20of%20Gross-Rosen\"&gt;subcamp&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gross-Rosen%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Gross-Rosen concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; women in the Zakrze district, as well as other &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt; camps, among the prisoners of which were also &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prisoners%20of%20war\"&gt;prisoners of war&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe story of Italian soldier is known. Despite risk Baldan was able to help Jewish women by giving them food, which he in turn received from &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt;, and he also escaped the camp and hid from Germans with the help of the Czechs. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat in World War II in 1945, &lt;a href=\"Expulsion%20of%20Germans%20after%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;most German inhabitants were expelled&lt;/a&gt; and Kudowa was repopulated with &lt;a href=\"Recovered%20Territories\"&gt;Polish settlers&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom were themselves expelled from &lt;a href=\"Kresy\"&gt;former Eastern Poland&lt;/a&gt;, annexed by the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming part of Poland it received municipal rights for the first time in its history. \nAs the area was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Corner\"&gt;Czech Corner&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"K%C5%82odzko%20Land\"&gt;K\u0142odzko Land&lt;/a&gt;, a population of &lt;a href=\"Czech%20people\"&gt;ethnic Czechs&lt;/a&gt; lived in Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j (then Bad Kudowa) before 1945. Small groups of Germans and Czechs continued to live in Kudowa until 1960. A German-speaking school was used from 1951 to 1960, and a Czech-speaking school was used from 1947 to 1955 by these small groups. &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20of%20the%20Greek%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Refugees of the Greek Civil War&lt;/a&gt; also settled in the town, as they found employment in the Zakrze textile factory.\nSince 1962, Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j hosts the annual International Moniuszko Festival, dedicated to the \"father of &lt;a href=\"Polish%20opera\"&gt;Polish national opera&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Stanis%C5%82aw%20Moniuszko\"&gt;Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko&lt;/a&gt;.\nSports.\nThe local &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club is W\u0142\u00f3kniarz Kudowa-Zdr\u00f3j. It competes in the lower leagues.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nKudowa-Zdr\u00f3j is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
