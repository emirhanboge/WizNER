The &lt;a href=\"thirteener\"&gt;thirteener&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Weminuche%20Wilderness\"&gt;Weminuche Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20National%20Forest\"&gt;San Juan National Forest&lt;/a&gt;, south-southeast (&lt;a href=\"Absolute%20bearing\"&gt;bearing&lt;/a&gt; 160\u00b0) of the &lt;a href=\"Silverton%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Town of Silverton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;San Juan County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nMountain.\nArrow Peak ranks 123rd among the highest mountains in Colorado and 182nd in the whole of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the peaks nearest to it are: &lt;a href=\"Vestal%20Peak\"&gt;Vestal Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Graystone Peak, &lt;a href=\"Electric%20Peak%20%28San%20Juan%20Mountains%29\"&gt;Electric Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Point Pun, West Trinity, and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Garfield%20%28San%20Juan%20County%2C%20Colorado%29\"&gt;Mount Garfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrow Peak falls under the &lt;a href=\"Grenadier%20Range\"&gt;Grenadier Range&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Mountains\"&gt;San Juan Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Given its rocky face, Arrow Peak, like other peaks of the Grenadier Range, offers one of the best mountaineering adventures in Colorado. History has it that the first Americans to scale Arrow Peak were William Cooper and John Hubbard in 1908, which was followed by a second ascent in 1932 by Carleton Long and John Nelson via a more arduous route called the Greystone-Arrow saddle.\nArrow Peak and its neighboring, peaks, especially &lt;a href=\"Vestal%20Peak\"&gt;Vestal Peak&lt;/a&gt;, all formed from the metamorphic rock &lt;a href=\"quartzite\"&gt;quartzite&lt;/a&gt;, are considered hard climbs, Arrow Peak ranking as the toughest before a new route was found."
