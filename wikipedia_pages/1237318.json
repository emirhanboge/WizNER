He was one of eight children born to Winthrop Sargent (1727\u20131793) and Judith Saunders. His elder sister was &lt;a href=\"Judith%20Sargent%20Murray\"&gt;Judith Sargent Murray&lt;/a&gt; (1751\u20131820), an essayist, playwright, and poet.\nHe was the grandson of Colonel &lt;a href=\"Epes%20Sargent%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;Epes Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest landholders in Gloucester. Sargent was also the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Sargent%20Sr.\"&gt;Daniel Sargent Sr.&lt;/a&gt; (1730\u20131806), a prominent merchant, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Dudley%20Sargent\"&gt;Paul Dudley Sargent&lt;/a&gt; (1745\u20131828), who also served in the &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Army\"&gt;Continental Army&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Sargent%20%28Loyalist%29\"&gt;John Sargent&lt;/a&gt; (1750\u20131824), a &lt;a href=\"Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29\"&gt;Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; during the Revolution.\nHe graduated from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20College\"&gt;Harvard College&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DXSxYAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA253%26amp%3Bdq%3DWinthrop%2BSargent%2Bharvard%2Bgraduate%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwi30pWC95TbAhVL2lMKHYxvCb0Q6AEIJzAA%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3DWinthrop%2520Sargent%2520harvard%2520graduate%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse\"&gt;Class of 1771&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. He spent some time at sea, as &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"cargo%20ship\"&gt;merchantman&lt;/a&gt; owned by his father.\nCareer.\nShortly after the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Sargent was commissioned in &lt;a href=\"Gridley%27s%20Regiment%20of%20Massachusetts%20Artillery\"&gt;Gridley's Regiment of Massachusetts Artillery&lt;/a&gt; on July 7, 1775 as a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, and later that year was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain%20lieutenant\"&gt;captain lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; of Knox's Regiment, Continental Artillery, on December 10. He was with his guns at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Boston\"&gt;siege of Boston&lt;/a&gt;, and later served in the battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Long%20Island\"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20White%20Plains\"&gt;White Plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trenton\"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Brandywine\"&gt;Brandywine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Germantown\"&gt;Germantown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; in the 3rd Continental Artillery on January 1, 1777, and &lt;a href=\"Brevet%20%28military%29\"&gt;brevet&lt;/a&gt;ted &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; on August 25, 1783 and was discharged from the Continental Army later that year. In 1783 he became an Original Member of the Massachusetts &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Society of the Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1786, he helped to survey the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Ranges\"&gt;Seven Ranges&lt;/a&gt;, the first lands laid out under the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Ordinance%20of%201785\"&gt;Land Ordinance of 1785&lt;/a&gt;. With inside knowledge of the area, he went on to form the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Company%20of%20Associates\"&gt;Ohio Company of Associates&lt;/a&gt;, was an important shareholder in the &lt;a href=\"Scioto%20Company\"&gt;Scioto Company&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 1787, secretary of the Ohio Company.\nSargent was appointed by the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation\"&gt;Congress of the Confederation&lt;/a&gt; as the first Secretary of the Northwest Territory, a post second in importance only to the governor, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20St.%20Clair\"&gt;Arthur St. Clair&lt;/a&gt;. He took up his post in 1788. Like St. Clair, Sargent would function in both civil and military capacities; he served as acting Adjutant General of U.S. Army from September 1791 until he was wounded twice at the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Clair%27s%20Defeat\"&gt;Battle of the Wabash&lt;/a&gt;, on November 4, 1791. On August 15, 1796, he would, as Acting Governor, proclaim the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt;, the first American government in what is now &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresident &lt;a href=\"John%20Adams\"&gt;John Adams&lt;/a&gt; then appointed Sargent the first Governor of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Territory\"&gt;Mississippi Territory&lt;/a&gt;, effective from May 7, 1798 to May 25, 1801. His last entry as Northwest Territory's secretary was on May 31, 1798; he arrived at &lt;a href=\"Natchez%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Natchez&lt;/a&gt; on August 6, but due to illness was unable to assume his post until August 16.\nThe subject was a cotton planter, marketing his crop in New York by Gilbert and John Aspinwall, merchants.\nLater life.\nIn 1788, Sargent was elected a Fellow of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt; elected in 1789 and an original member of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Society of the Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; as a delegate from &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, and published, with Benjamin B. Smith, \"Papers Relative to Certain American Antiquities\" (Philadelphia, 1796), and \"Boston,\" a poem (Boston, 1803).\nBeing a Federalist, Sargent was dismissed from his position as territorial governor of Mississippi in 1801 by incoming president &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;. Sargent took up life in the private sector, developing his plantation &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20%28Natchez%2C%20Mississippi%29\"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;, the earliest such establishment in &lt;a href=\"Natchez%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Natchez&lt;/a&gt;. Sargent was elected a member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Antiquarian%20Society\"&gt;American Antiquarian Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1813.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1789, he married Roewena Tupper (1766\u20131790), a daughter of Gen. &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Tupper\"&gt;Benjamin Tupper&lt;/a&gt;, at the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Marietta%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marietta&lt;/a&gt; in the first marriage ceremony held under the laws of the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territory\"&gt;Northwest Territory&lt;/a&gt;. After her death, he married Hannah Ober of Massachusetts on 13 Feb 1791. They had a daughter, Hannah born 25 August 1791 in Massachusetts, and Hannah Ober died the next day. Then he married Mary McIntosh Williams (1760\u20131823) shortly after moving to &lt;a href=\"Natchez%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Natchez&lt;/a&gt;. They were the parents of:\nHe died on June 3, 1820 in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. His grandson was the writer &lt;a href=\"Winthrop%20Sargent%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Winthrop Sargent&lt;/a&gt; (1825\u20131870). A 1848 Louisiana Supreme Court case decided that the Louisiana portion of Winthrop\u2019s estate which included real estate, timber, agricultural properties in Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts would be divided between his son George Washington Sargent as well as his stepchildren through his marriage to Mary Williams. These step children included Mary (Williams) Urquhart and Mary Sargents grandchildren through her deceased son James C Williams, namely David Percy Williams. Today, some of the properties of the Winthrop Sargent estate is owned and operated by one of the descendants of David Williams and his son James C Williams children who are heirs of Winthrop Sargent as mentioned in the Louisiana Supreme Court; namely Anton Robert Williams who runs functions on the Louisiana, Natchez Mississippi and Ohio properties from his holding company, the Anton Robert Williams Holding Company, Headquarters in Grand Rapids Michigan and Kalamazoo Michigan. \nLegacy.\nAlthough there are at least two Sargent Townships (in &lt;a href=\"Sargent%20Township%2C%20Douglas%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sargent%20Township%2C%20Custer%20County%2C%20Nebraska\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;) and one &lt;a href=\"Sargent%20County%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Sargent County&lt;/a&gt;, it is not known if these are named after Winthrop Sargent. However, a former township of the Northwest Territory's &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; was designated as Sargent Township or the District of Sargent; this apparently encompassed the settlements downriver from Detroit and at the &lt;a href=\"River%20Raisin\"&gt;River Raisin&lt;/a&gt; in what is now &lt;a href=\"Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Monroe County, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. This township apparently ceased to function after the organization of &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Territory\"&gt;Michigan Territory&lt;/a&gt;, being replaced by the District of Erie.\nA student dormitory at Ohio University (founded in 1804) in Athens, Ohio, is named Sargent Hall in his honor. This is the first university in the Northwest Territory and the first in Ohio."
