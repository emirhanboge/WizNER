    "text": "The Scottish Women's Rugby Union (SWRU) was the national &lt;a href=\"Sports%20governing%20body\"&gt;governing body&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20rugby%20union\"&gt;women's rugby union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It was responsible for the governance of women's rugby union within Scotland. Its role was all encompassing. It went from youth recruitment, through administrating all senior based (aged 16+) competition, through to the performance and management of the &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland women's national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt their AGM in June 2009 the SWRU voted unanimously in favour of amalgamating the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; and the SWRU to form an integrated national governing body rugby in Scotland.\nExecutive Board.\nThe SWRU was led by a volunteer based Executive Board. Board members were elected at the &lt;a href=\"Annual%20General%20Meeting\"&gt;Annual General Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (AGM) at June each year. The Executive Board was renamed from the Executive Committee in the 2007 AGM.The posts were annual in nature with the exception of the Chairperson, whose post was held for 2 years. Board members had to be affiliated with a women's &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club.\nPast Board Members\nFull time staff.\nIn addition to the volunteer Executive Board, three full-time staff based at the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; assisted with the planning and delivery of the women's &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; programme throughout &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. From 2001 to 2005 only 2 posts existed, the Women's Administration Manager and the Girls Development Officer. In 2005, in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt;, the two posts were re-purposed, with another one created as a result. The new staffing structure consisted of a Community Manager, a Performance Development Manager (responsible for the performance pathways programme) and a Women's Development Officer (responsible for Youth and Senior rugby).\nNational Competitions.\nIn the 2010-2011 season, there were four divisions within the Scottish league: Premier League 1, Premier League 2, National League and the National Development League.\nNational Development League.\nThe National Development League consisted of a number of clubs which included:\nNational 7s competition.\nAnnually, a National 7s competition was traditionally held on the first weekend of May. For five years, it was held at Portobello Rugby Club in Edinburgh. The normal format was for teams to be split into two pools, with semi-finalists chosen through the top 2 winners of the pools.\nScottish Universities Championship.\nThe Scottish Universities Championship was not run by the SWRU, instead it was administered by the &lt;a href=\"British%20University%20Sports%20Association\"&gt;British University and Colleges Sport&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinners:\nRepresentative Rugby.\nIn the 2006-2007 season, there were 4 tiers of women's representative teams run and managed by the SWRU, in order:"
