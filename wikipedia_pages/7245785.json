After five years at Everton, he transferred to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth \u00a327.5\u00a0million in September 2013. After five years with Manchester United that included four trophies and more than a decade in England in total, Fellaini joined Shandong Luneng in February 2019.\nA full international for the &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium national team&lt;/a&gt; from 2007 until his retirement in March 2019, Fellaini amassed 87 caps and 18 goals for \"The Red Devils\".

His father, Abdellatif, was a former goalkeeper for &lt;a href=\"Raja%20Casablanca\"&gt;Raja Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hassania%20Agadir\"&gt;Hassania Agadir&lt;/a&gt; who signed for &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Mechelen\"&gt;Racing Mechelen&lt;/a&gt; but was unable to play as his former Moroccan club refused to release his paperwork. Instead of returning home, he opted to become a bus driver for &lt;a href=\"STIB\"&gt;STIB&lt;/a&gt;. Fellaini is Muslim.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Etterbeek\"&gt;Etterbeek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels Capital-Region&lt;/a&gt;, Fellaini began playing football at the age of 8 for &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;. He also competed in &lt;a href=\"Sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"10%2C000%20metres\"&gt;10,000 metres&lt;/a&gt; being his preferred event. However, Fellaini's father Abdellatif, who was a professional footballer himself, guided his son towards football.\nIn his first season at Anderlecht's Academy, he scored 26 goals and in his second he scored 37. He was at Anderlecht's academy until the age of 10 when he joined &lt;a href=\"R.A.E.C.%20Mons\"&gt;Mons&lt;/a&gt;, due to his father getting a new job in the city. Three years later, he joined &lt;a href=\"R.%20Francs%20Borains\"&gt;R. Francs Borains&lt;/a&gt; before leaving the club when he signed for &lt;a href=\"R.%20Charleroi%20S.C.\"&gt;Sporting Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of 17, he signed his first permanent contract with &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Standard Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;. Between 2006 and 2008, he made 84 appearances for the club, scoring 11 times. He is known for his heading ability and stamina, which made him one of the best &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23%26quot%3BBox-to-box%26quot%3B%20midfielder\"&gt;box-to-box&lt;/a&gt; midfielders in the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division\"&gt;Belgian First Division&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in him winning the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Ebony%20Shoe\"&gt;Ebony Shoe&lt;/a&gt; in 2008, an award given to the best player of the season of African descent.\nEverton.\nAfter rejecting the advances of &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and following reported interest from &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, Fellaini signed for &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; in September 2008 on a five-year deal from Standard Li\u00e8ge for an initial transfer fee of \u00a315\u00a0million (at the time a record for a Belgian player and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Everton%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics%23Transfer%20records\"&gt;club record&lt;/a&gt; for Everton). He made his Everton debut in a 3\u20132 away victory at &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt; on 14 September 2008, and scored his first goal for the team against &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; in a 2\u20132 home draw on 5 October 2008. Fellaini went on to score 9 goals in his first season.\nDuring his debut season he was booked 10 times in his first 17 games and avoided a lengthy suspension by attending a personal hearing with England's chief referee, &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Hackett\"&gt;Keith Hackett&lt;/a&gt;, where he vowed to improve his behaviour. He picked up three further bookings in 16 games following the meeting, his total the highest of all &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; players that season.\nAt the end of the 2008\u201309 season Fellaini was named Everton's Young Player of the Season.\nIn England he has become well known for his large &lt;a href=\"afro\"&gt;afro&lt;/a&gt; hairstyle, becoming a fan favourite with Everton fans regularly sporting Afro wigs as a homage to Fellaini. Fellaini was deployed as a &lt;a href=\"second%20striker\"&gt;second striker&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Everton%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;, when Everton had all of their forwards out injured, usually playing behind another midfielder being used as an attacker, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Cahill\"&gt;Tim Cahill&lt;/a&gt;. Later Fellaini reverted to play in his least favourite defensive midfield area. His performances in late 2009 and early 2010 became so impressive that &lt;a href=\"David%20Moyes\"&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; labelled him \"as good as anyone in the league\", and he re-iterated this after Fellaini won &lt;a href=\"Man%20of%20the%20Match\"&gt;Man of the Match&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; on 16 January. Fellaini was stretchered off in the 34th minute of the &lt;a href=\"Merseyside%20derby\"&gt;Merseyside derby&lt;/a&gt; on 6 February after a two-footed tackle by &lt;a href=\"Sotirios%20Kyrgiakos\"&gt;Sotirios Kyrgiakos&lt;/a&gt;, ruling him out for the rest of the 2009\u201310 season. Kyrgiakos was sent off as a result of Fellaini's injury.\nFellaini suffered an ankle injury in an FA Cup replay victory against Chelsea in February 2011 and although he was able to play in a 2\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; a week later, the injury caused him to miss the remainder of the 2010\u201311 season. He did not play a competitive match until August 2011, when he appeared as a substitute in a 1\u20130 loss to &lt;a href=\"Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Queens Park Rangers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Goodison%20Park\"&gt;Goodison Park&lt;/a&gt; and played the full match in the very next fixture, as Everton beat &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In November 2011, he signed a new five-year contract with the club. He finished the season having won the most tackles, aerial duels and made more passes than anyone else at the club. He won the second highest number of tackles in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; and won possession of the ball 190 times, the most out of any player.\nIn the opening game of the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2012\u201313 Premier League season&lt;/a&gt; against Manchester United, Fellaini received plaudits for his outstanding performance, as he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory. He continued the season in great form with goals against Arsenal, Manchester City, Sunderland and Fulham amongst others. Fellaini was subsequently awarded Premier League Player of the Month for November 2012.\nFellaini was banned for three matches by the Football Association on 17 December 2012 after headbutting &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Shawcross\"&gt;Ryan Shawcross&lt;/a&gt; during a game against Stoke City, an incident missed by the match officials at the time. The same month he was ranked as number 60 in \"The 100 Best Footballers in the World\" by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\".\nManchester United.\n2013\u201314 season.\nOn 2 September 2013, Fellaini signed a four-year contract, with the option of extension of another season, reuniting with former manager &lt;a href=\"David%20Moyes\"&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; at Manchester United in a \u00a327.5\u00a0million, deadline day deal, despite the fact that he had a lower buyout clause earlier in the transfer window. He made his debut for the club on 14 September, in a 2\u20130 home win against &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute for &lt;a href=\"Anderson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201988%29\"&gt;Anderson&lt;/a&gt;.

He was given his first start of the season by Van Gaal in the following match against &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, and helped United earn a point against the league leaders. Fellaini covered 12.17 kilometres in the match, the most by any United player, and made 70 high-intensity runs, more than anyone else on the pitch. During second half stoppage time, he contributed to United's goal when his header was saved by &lt;a href=\"Thibaut%20Courtois\"&gt;Thibaut Courtois&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately rebounded in by &lt;a href=\"Robin%20van%20Persie\"&gt;Robin van Persie&lt;/a&gt;.

Due to &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;'s preference for &lt;a href=\"Ander%20Herrera\"&gt;Ander Herrera&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Pogba\"&gt;Paul Pogba&lt;/a&gt; in central midfield, Fellaini's appearances for Manchester United had become limited to coming off the bench; however, on 11 January \u2013 the day after he scored the second goal in Manchester United's 2\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; in the first leg of their &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Cup\"&gt;2016\u201317 EFL Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final \u2013 Manchester United activated a one-year extension clause in Fellaini's contract, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2017\u201318 season.

After the win, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho praised his performances, saying \u201cHe had to be a strong character. He is a fighter, a guy with lots of pride and I am really pleased I helped him reach this level and change the perception the fans have now. I\u2019m really happy for him\u201d.
