    "text": "During the &lt;a href=\"Dot-com%20bubble\"&gt;dot-com&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000, the proliferation of many dot-com &lt;a href=\"Startup%20company\"&gt;start-up companies&lt;/a&gt; created a secondary bubble in the &lt;a href=\"telecommunications\"&gt;telecommunications&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"computer%20networking\"&gt;computer networking&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure and telecommunications &lt;a href=\"service%20provider\"&gt;service provider&lt;/a&gt; markets. &lt;a href=\"Venture%20capital\"&gt;Venture capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20tech\"&gt;high tech&lt;/a&gt; companies rushed to build next generation infrastructure equipment for the expected explosion of internet traffic. As part of that investment fever, &lt;a href=\"network%20processor\"&gt;network processor&lt;/a&gt;s were seen as a method of dealing with the desire for more network services and the ever-increasing data-rates of communication networks.\nIt has been estimated that dozens of start-up companies were created in the race to build the processors that would be a component of the next generation telecommunications equipment. Once the internet investment bubble burst, the telecom network upgrade cycle was deferred for years (perhaps for a decade). As a result, the majority of these new companies went bankrupt.\nAs of 2007, the only companies that are shipping network processors in sizeable volumes are &lt;a href=\"Cisco%20Systems\"&gt;Cisco Systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marvell%20Technology%20Group\"&gt;Marvell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freescale\"&gt;Freescale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cavium%20Networks\"&gt;Cavium Networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Applied%20Micro%20Circuits%20Corporation\"&gt;AMCC&lt;/a&gt;."
