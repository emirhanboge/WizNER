    "text": "Manchester United Football Club is a professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford%20%28area%29\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, England, that competes in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, the top flight of &lt;a href=\"English%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;English football&lt;/a&gt;. Nicknamed \"the Red Devils\", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Heath\"&gt;Newton Heath&lt;/a&gt; to its current stadium, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, in 1910.\nManchester United have won the most trophies in English club football, including a record 20 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23Total%20titles%20won\"&gt;League titles&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, five &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;League Cups&lt;/a&gt; and a record 21 &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;FA Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;s. They have won the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup/UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; three times, and the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; once each. In 1968, under the management of &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Busby\"&gt;Matt Busby&lt;/a&gt;, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20air%20disaster\"&gt;Munich air disaster&lt;/a&gt;, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions League titles, between 1986 and 2013. In the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1998\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt;, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the European &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;treble&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa League under &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2016\u201317&lt;/a&gt;, they also became &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions\"&gt;one of five clubs&lt;/a&gt; to have won the original three main &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).\nManchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world, and has rivalries with &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20derby\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;. Manchester United was the &lt;a href=\"Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League\"&gt;highest-earning&lt;/a&gt; football club in the world for 2016\u201317, with an annual revenue of \u20ac676.3\u00a0million, and the world's &lt;a href=\"Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs\"&gt;third most valuable&lt;/a&gt; football club in 2019, valued at \u00a33.15\u00a0billion ($3.81\u00a0billion). After being floated on the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Glazer\"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt; valued at almost \u00a3800\u00a0million, of which over \u00a3500\u00a0million of borrowed money became the club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"Glazer%20ownership%20of%20Manchester%20United\"&gt;the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1878\u20131945).\nManchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway\"&gt;Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway&lt;/a&gt; (LYR) depot at &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Heath\"&gt;Newton Heath&lt;/a&gt;. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company \u2013 green and gold \u2013 they were defeated 6\u20130 by &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Combination\"&gt;The Combination&lt;/a&gt;, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Football%20Alliance\"&gt;Football Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892\u201393 season in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 1902, with debts of \u00a32,670 \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3 in \u2013 the club was served with a &lt;a href=\"liquidation\"&gt;winding-up order&lt;/a&gt;. Captain &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Stafford\"&gt;Harry Stafford&lt;/a&gt; found four local businessmen, including &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Davies\"&gt;John Henry Davies&lt;/a&gt; (who became club president), each willing to invest \u00a3500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Mangnall\"&gt;Ernest Mangnall&lt;/a&gt;, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 \u2013 the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;Charity Shield&lt;/a&gt; and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a &lt;a href=\"yo-yo%20club\"&gt;yo-yo club&lt;/a&gt;, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for &lt;a href=\"James%20W.%20Gibson\"&gt;James W. Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, who, in December 1931, invested \u00a32,000 and assumed control of the club. In the &lt;a href=\"1938%E2%80%9339%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1938\u201339 season&lt;/a&gt;, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.\nBusby years (1945\u20131969).\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Busby\"&gt;Matt Busby&lt;/a&gt;, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in &lt;a href=\"1948%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the semi-final, which they lost to &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, the team recorded a 10\u20130 victory over Belgian champions &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The &lt;a href=\"Munich%20air%20disaster\"&gt;Munich air disaster&lt;/a&gt; of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players\u00a0\u2013 &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Bent\"&gt;Geoff Bent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Byrne\"&gt;Roger Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Colman\"&gt;Eddie Colman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Edwards\"&gt;Duncan Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29\"&gt;Mark Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Pegg\"&gt;David Pegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Taylor\"&gt;Tommy Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Whelan\"&gt;Billy Whelan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 and injured several more.\nAssistant manager &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt; took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the &lt;a href=\"1958%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt;, which they lost to &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. In recognition of the team's tragedy, &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; invited the club to compete in the &lt;a href=\"1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1958\u201359 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; alongside eventual League champions &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Law\"&gt;Denis Law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Crerand\"&gt;Pat Crerand&lt;/a&gt;, who combined with the next generation of youth players \u2013 including &lt;a href=\"George%20Best\"&gt;George Best&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 to win the FA Cup in &lt;a href=\"1963%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"1968%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; with a team that contained three &lt;a href=\"Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29\"&gt;European Footballers of the Year&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Charlton\"&gt;Bobby Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, Denis Law and George Best. They then represented Europe in the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Intercontinental%20Cup\"&gt;1968 Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; against Estudiantes of Argentina, but lost the tie after losing the first leg in Buenos Aires, before a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player &lt;a href=\"Wilf%20McGuinness\"&gt;Wilf McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;.\n1969\u20131986.\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"1969%E2%80%9370%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1969\u201370 season&lt;/a&gt; and a poor start to the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1970\u201371 season&lt;/a&gt;, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20O%27Farrell\"&gt;Frank O'Farrell&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18\u00a0months before being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Docherty\"&gt;Tommy Docherty&lt;/a&gt; in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in &lt;a href=\"1976%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;, but were beaten by &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;. They reached the final again in &lt;a href=\"1977%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.\n&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Sexton\"&gt;Dave Sexton&lt;/a&gt; replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Joe Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20McQueen\"&gt;Gordon McQueen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Bailey\"&gt;Gary Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Wilkins\"&gt;Ray Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979\u201380 and lost to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1979%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1979 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Atkinson\"&gt;Ron Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Robson\"&gt;Bryan Robson&lt;/a&gt; from his former club &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in &lt;a href=\"1983%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1985%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; and beat rivals Liverpool to win the &lt;a href=\"1983%20FA%20Charity%20Shield\"&gt;1983 Charity Shield&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1985%E2%80%9386%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1985\u201386&lt;/a&gt;, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.\nFerguson years (1986\u20132013).\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Knox\"&gt;Archie Knox&lt;/a&gt; arrived from &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1987\u201388&lt;/a&gt;, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1990%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1990 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;European Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, where United beat &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; holders &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;. The club appeared in two consecutive &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals in 1991 and 1992, beating &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the second to claim that competition for the first time as well. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title \u2013 alongside the FA Cup \u2013 to complete the first \"&lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Double&lt;/a&gt;\" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995\u201396, before retaining the league title once more in 1996\u201397 with a game to spare.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1998\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt;, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League \u2013 \"The Treble\" \u2013 in the same season. Losing 1\u20130 going into &lt;a href=\"injury%20time\"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;1999 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teddy%20Sheringham\"&gt;Teddy Sheringham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r\"&gt;Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. That summer, Ferguson received a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; for his services to football. In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; with a 1\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras\"&gt;Palmeiras&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo.\nManchester United won the league again in the &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;1999\u20132000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt; seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2001\u201302&lt;/a&gt;, before regaining the title in &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt;. They won the &lt;a href=\"2004%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2003\u201304 FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the final at the &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Stadium\"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt;, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2006 Football League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006\u201307 season, before completing the &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29%23European%20Doubles\"&gt;European double&lt;/a&gt; in 2007\u201308 with a 6\u20135 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2008 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Giggs\"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt; made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the &lt;a href=\"2008%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and followed this with the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;2008\u201309 Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, forward &lt;a href=\"Cristiano%20Ronaldo\"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; was sold to Real Madrid for a world record \u00a380\u00a0million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2\u20131 at Wembley to retain the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.\nAfter finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009\u201310 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010\u201311, securing the championship with a 1\u20131 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012\u201313, securing the championship with a 3\u20130 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.\n2013\u2013present.\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager in football history. The club announced the next day that &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"David%20Moyes\"&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Giggs\"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt; took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1995\u201396. They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Louis%20van%20Gaal\"&gt;Louis van Gaal&lt;/a&gt; would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant. &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Glazer\"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt;, the patriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Glazer%20ownership%20of%20Manchester%20United\"&gt;family that owns the club&lt;/a&gt;, died on 28 May 2014.\nUnder Van Gaal, United won a &lt;a href=\"2016%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;12th FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements. Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league. Former &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt; was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016. Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the &lt;a href=\"2016%20FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;FA Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Cup\"&gt;EFL Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Rooney\"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt; in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer. The following season, United finished second in the league \u2013 their highest league placing since 2013 \u2013 but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th &lt;a href=\"2018%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, but they lost 1\u20130 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskj\u00e6r was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.\nOn 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Super%20League\"&gt;European Super League&lt;/a&gt;, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK Government&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later. The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Woodward\"&gt;Ed Woodward&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"2021%20Old%20Trafford%20protests\"&gt;resultant protests&lt;/a&gt; against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a &lt;a href=\"pitch%20invasion\"&gt;pitch invasion&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.\nOn the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.%209%E2%80%930%20Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;9\u20130 win&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; on 2 February 2021, but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Villarreal%20CF\"&gt;Villarreal&lt;/a&gt;, going four straight seasons without a trophy. On 20 November 2021, Solskj\u00e6r left his role as manager. Former midfielder &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Carrick\"&gt;Michael Carrick&lt;/a&gt; took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Ralf%20Rangnick\"&gt;Ralf Rangnick&lt;/a&gt; as interim manager until the end of the season.\nCrest and colours.\nThe club &lt;a href=\"Crest%20%28sports%29\"&gt;crest&lt;/a&gt; is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20Council%23Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;Manchester City Council coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail. The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971. In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a &lt;a href=\"heraldic%20badge\"&gt;heraldic badge&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Arms\"&gt;College of Arms&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt; for use by Manchester United.\nNewton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'. A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue &lt;a href=\"knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;knickerbockers&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit. Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the &lt;a href=\"1909%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1909 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. They remained part of their home kits until 1927. For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change. The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018\u201319, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit. Since 1997\u201398, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility. The current home kit is a red shirt with the trademark Adidas &lt;a href=\"three%20stripes\"&gt;three stripes&lt;/a&gt; in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999\u20132000 season, and the 2011\u201312 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks. An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995\u201396 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts. In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.\nThe club's third kit is often all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014\u201315 season. Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 seasons and once in 1996\u201397, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998\u201399 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003\u201304 and 2005\u201306. From 2006\u201307 to 2013\u201314, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006\u201307 and 2010\u201311, apart from the 2008\u201309 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1967\u201368 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; success.\nGrounds.\n1878\u20131893: North Road.\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on &lt;a href=\"North%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;North Road&lt;/a&gt;, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.\n1893\u20131910: Bank Street.\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary &lt;a href=\"A.%20H.%20Albut\"&gt;A. H. Albut&lt;/a&gt; procured the use of the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;Bank Street ground&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Clayton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Clayton&lt;/a&gt;. It initially had no stands, by the start of the &lt;a href=\"1893%E2%80%9394%20Newton%20Heath%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1893\u201394 season&lt;/a&gt;, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\". Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw &lt;a href=\"Alf%20Farman\"&gt;Alf Farman&lt;/a&gt; score a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt;, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3\u20132 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; three weeks later. In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the &lt;a href=\"Broughton%20Rangers\"&gt;Broughton Rangers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at &lt;a href=\"Harpurhey\"&gt;Harpurhey&lt;/a&gt; for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid \u00a3500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.\n1910\u2013present: Old Trafford.\nFollowing Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around \u00a360,000. Architect &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Leitch\"&gt;Archibald Leitch&lt;/a&gt; was given a budget of \u00a330,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-final between &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Grimsby Town&lt;/a&gt; drew 76,962\u00a0spectators.\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the &lt;a href=\"War%20Damage%20Commission\"&gt;War Damage Commission&lt;/a&gt; in the amount of \u00a322,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's &lt;a href=\"Maine%20Road\"&gt;Maine Road&lt;/a&gt; ground; Manchester United was charged \u00a35,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts. Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a &lt;a href=\"cantilever\"&gt;cantilever&lt;/a&gt;ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1993\u201394 season&lt;/a&gt;. First used on 25 March 1957 and costing \u00a340,000, four pylons were erected, each housing 54\u00a0individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Report\"&gt;Taylor Report&lt;/a&gt;'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998\u201399 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131, with just 114 seats (0.15\u00a0per\u00a0cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957. Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021 United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.\nSupport.\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants &lt;a href=\"Deloitte\"&gt;Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; estimate that Manchester United has 75\u00a0million fans worldwide. The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;), with over &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20most-followed%20Facebook%20pages\"&gt;72\u00a0million Facebook followers&lt;/a&gt; as of July 2020. A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Association\"&gt;Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association&lt;/a&gt; (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum, and the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Trust\"&gt;Manchester United Supporters' Trust&lt;/a&gt; (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20United%20of%20Manchester\"&gt;F.C. United of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. The West Stand of Old Trafford \u2013 the \"&lt;a href=\"Stretford%20End\"&gt;Stretford End&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.\nRivalries.\nManchester United has rivalries with &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;, against whom they contest the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20derby\"&gt;Manchester derby&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; was a major port. The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions; and between them they have won &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20English%20football%20champions\"&gt;39 league titles&lt;/a&gt;, 9 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cups&lt;/a&gt;, 4 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cups&lt;/a&gt;, 5 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, 19 &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, 13 &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;League Cups&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt;s, 1 &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; and 36 &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;FA Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;s. It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football. Former Manchester United manager &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\".\nThe \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;House of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;House of York&lt;/a&gt;, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and &lt;a href=\"Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger\"&gt;Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&lt;/a&gt;, have battled for the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.\nGlobal brand.\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at \u00a3412\u00a0million \u2013 an increase of \u00a339\u00a0million on the previous year, valuing it at \u00a311\u00a0million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid \u2013 and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong). In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by \"&lt;a href=\"Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23\u00a0billion. The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3\u00a0billion. \"Forbes\" magazine valued the club at $3.3\u00a0billion \u2013 $1.2\u00a0billion higher than the next most valuable sports team. They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the \"Forbes\" list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689\u00a0billion.\nThe core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim. The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"&lt;a href=\"catenaccio\"&gt;catenaccio&lt;/a&gt;\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\". Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Beatle\"&gt;Fifth Beatle&lt;/a&gt;\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities \u2013 the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the &lt;a href=\"BSkyB\"&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt; broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005\u201306, the club's commercial arm generated \u00a351\u00a0million, compared to \u00a342.5\u00a0million at Chelsea, \u00a339.3\u00a0million at Liverpool, \u00a334\u00a0million at Arsenal and \u00a327.9\u00a0million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a \u00a3303\u00a0million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services \u2013 such as the club's dedicated television channel, &lt;a href=\"MUTV%20%28Manchester%20United%20F.C.%29\"&gt;MUTV&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.\nSponsorship.\nIn an initial five-year deal worth \u00a3500,000, &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Corporation\"&gt;Sharp Electronics&lt;/a&gt; became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982\u201383 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, when &lt;a href=\"Vodafone\"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; agreed a four-year, \u00a330\u00a0million deal. Vodafone agreed to pay \u00a336\u00a0million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.\nTo commence at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, American insurance corporation &lt;a href=\"American%20International%20Group\"&gt;AIG&lt;/a&gt; agreed a four-year \u00a356.5\u00a0million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world. At the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season, American reinsurance company &lt;a href=\"Aon%20plc\"&gt;Aon&lt;/a&gt; became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately \u00a380\u00a0million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history. Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with &lt;a href=\"DHL%20Express\"&gt;DHL&lt;/a&gt; reported to be worth \u00a340\u00a0million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football. The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner. The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth \u00a3180\u00a0million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the &lt;a href=\"Trafford%20Training%20Centre\"&gt;Trafford Training Centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club's first kit manufacturer was &lt;a href=\"Umbro\"&gt;Umbro&lt;/a&gt;, until a five-year deal was agreed with &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Sportswear\"&gt;Admiral Sportswear&lt;/a&gt; in 1975. &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt; received the contract in 1980, before Umbro started a second spell in 1992. Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;'s record-breaking \u00a3302.9\u00a0million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8\u00a0million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company. In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and &lt;a href=\"Budweiser\"&gt;Budweiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014\u201315 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand &lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;. Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014\u201315 season, citing rising costs. Since the start of the 2015\u201316 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of \u00a3750\u00a0million. Plumbing products manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Kohler%20Co.\"&gt;Kohler&lt;/a&gt; became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018\u201319 season. Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, \u00a3235m sponsorship deal with &lt;a href=\"TeamViewer\"&gt;TeamViewer&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2021\u201322 season.\nOwnership and finances.\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for \u00a31 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested \u00a3500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of \u00a32,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Hardman\"&gt;Harold Hardman&lt;/a&gt;.\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately \u00a340,000, he accumulated a 54\u00a0per\u00a0cent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Edwards\"&gt;Martin Edwards&lt;/a&gt; went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Maxwell\"&gt;Robert Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Knighton\"&gt;Michael Knighton&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a320\u00a0million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising \u00a36.7\u00a0million), and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from &lt;a href=\"Rupert%20Murdoch\"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"BSkyB\"&gt;British Sky Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; Corporation. This resulted in the formation of \"Shareholders United Against Murdoch\" \u2013 now the \"Manchester United Supporters' Trust\" \u2013 who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any &lt;a href=\"hostile%20takeover\"&gt;hostile takeover&lt;/a&gt;. The Manchester United board accepted a \u00a3623\u00a0million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the &lt;a href=\"Competition%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Monopolies and Mergers Commission&lt;/a&gt; at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, &lt;a href=\"John%20Magnier\"&gt;John Magnier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.%20P.%20McManus\"&gt;J. P. McManus&lt;/a&gt;, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse &lt;a href=\"Rock%20of%20Gibraltar%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Rock of Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.\nGlazer ownership.\nIn May 2005, &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Glazer\"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt; purchased the 28.7\u00a0per\u00a0cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately \u00a3800\u00a0million (then approx. $1.5\u00a0billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange. Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of \u00a3540\u00a0million, at interest rates of between 7% to 20%.\nIn July 2006, the club announced a \u00a3660\u00a0million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30\u00a0per\u00a0cent reduction in annual interest payments to \u00a362\u00a0million a year. In January 2010, with debts of \u00a3716.5\u00a0million ($1.17\u00a0billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth \u00a3504\u00a0million, enabling them to pay off most of the \u00a3509\u00a0million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds \u2013 which were to mature on 1 February 2017 \u2013 is approximately \u00a345\u00a0million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's &lt;a href=\"Trafford%20Training%20Centre\"&gt;Trafford Training Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest. The club's debts reached a high of \u00a3777\u00a0million in June 2007.\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached &lt;a href=\"Credit%20Suisse\"&gt;Credit Suisse&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for a $1\u00a0billion (approx. \u00a3600\u00a0million) &lt;a href=\"initial%20public%20offering\"&gt;initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; (IPO) on the &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Exchange\"&gt;Singapore stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; that would value the club at more than \u00a32\u00a0billion; however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;'s disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3\u00a0billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.\nThe New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\"). Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public. As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.\nIn 2012, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" estimated that the club had paid a total of over \u00a3500\u00a0million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers, and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to \u00a31\u00a0billion. At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly \u00a3400\u00a0million.\nPlayers.\nReserves and academy.\nList of under-23s and academy players with articles\nHonours.\nManchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles \u2013 including a record 13 Premier League titles \u2013 and their total of 12 FA Cups is second only to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;FA Community Shield&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs.\nThe club had a successful period under the management of &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Busby\"&gt;Matt Busby&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the FA Cup in &lt;a href=\"1948%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt; and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1968%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, winning five league titles in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;; five league titles, four FA Cups, one &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The club has won the &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Double&lt;/a&gt; (winning the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995\u201396 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the \"Double Double\". United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in &lt;a href=\"1999%20Intercontinental%20Cup\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; and are one of only two British clubs to have won the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2008%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Treble&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club's most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the \"&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions\"&gt;European Treble&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup/UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup/Europa League&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoubles and Trebles.\nEspecially short competitions such as the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;Charity/Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; (now defunct), &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.\nManchester United Women.\nA team called Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20Women%27s%20Regional%20Football%20League\"&gt;North West Women's Regional Football League&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Glazer\"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt;'s takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\". In 2018, Manchester United formed a new &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20W.F.C.\"&gt;women's football team&lt;/a&gt;, which entered the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Women%27s%20Championship\"&gt;second division of women's football in England&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Manchester%20United%20W.F.C.%20season\"&gt;debut season&lt;/a&gt;."
