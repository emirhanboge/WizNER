Main bands performing were &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Pretty%20Things%20%28band%29\"&gt;Dirty Pretty Things&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feeder%20%28band%29\"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Starsailor%20%28band%29\"&gt;Starsailor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supergrass\"&gt;Supergrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2%20Many%20DJs\"&gt;2 Many DJs&lt;/a&gt;, The recently reformed &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt; and Sunday's closing act, &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dance tent featured &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Tong\"&gt;Pete Tong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Guetta\"&gt;David Guetta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Cox\"&gt;Carl Cox&lt;/a&gt;. The Hacienda Classics Tent, celebrating 25 years of one of the world's most famous clubs, was popular on Sunday with DJ sets from &lt;a href=\"Boney%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Boney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hook\"&gt;Peter Hook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%20Guy%20Called%20Gerald\"&gt;A Guy Called Gerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nFans also got the chance to see their musical heroes play their favourite tunes in the Rock DJ Tent which featured &lt;a href=\"Belle%20%26amp%3B%20Sebastian\"&gt;Belle &amp; Sebastian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bez%20%28dancer%29\"&gt;Bez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Colour%20Scene\"&gt;Ocean Colour Scene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20View%20%28band%29\"&gt;The View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Embrace%20%28English%20band%29\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nA second Live at Loch Lomond festival was held in the summer of 2008, however it was less successful due to UpFront security staff on site at the festival refusing entry to many fans due to \"health and safety reasons\" (i.e. lighting was inadequate along a few stretches of walkway) causing many bands (including some local bands who saw this as a great opportunity) to play to as little as 10 people.\nIt was recently revealed in a local newspaper that it is likely the festival held in 2008 would be the last Live at Loch Lomand as promoters feel that the weather conditions are too poor to run a festival. However, a final decision regarding the festival's fate has yet to be made."
