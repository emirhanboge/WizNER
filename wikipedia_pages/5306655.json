    "text": "The ciliary processes are formed by the inward folding of the various layers of the &lt;a href=\"choroid\"&gt;choroid&lt;/a&gt;, viz. the &lt;a href=\"choroid%20proper\"&gt;choroid proper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lamina%20basalis%20choroideae\"&gt;lamina basalis&lt;/a&gt;, and are received between corresponding foldings of the &lt;a href=\"suspensory%20ligament%20of%20the%20lens\"&gt;suspensory ligament of the lens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnatomy.\nThey are arranged in a circle, and form a sort of frill behind the &lt;a href=\"Iris%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;iris&lt;/a&gt;, around the margin of the &lt;a href=\"lens%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey vary from sixty to eighty in number, lie side by side, and may be divided into large and small; the former are about 2.5\u00a0mm. in length, and the latter, consisting of about one-third of the entire number, are situated in spaces between them, but without regular arrangement.\nThey are attached by their periphery to three or four of the ridges of the &lt;a href=\"orbiculus%20ciliaris\"&gt;orbiculus ciliaris&lt;/a&gt;, and are continuous with the layers of the choroid: their opposite extremities are free and rounded, and are directed toward the posterior chamber of the eyeball and circumference of the lens.\nIn front, they are continuous with the periphery of the iris.\nTheir posterior surfaces are connected with the suspensory ligament of the lens.\nFunction.\nThe ciliary processes produce &lt;a href=\"aqueous%20humour\"&gt;aqueous humour&lt;/a&gt;."
