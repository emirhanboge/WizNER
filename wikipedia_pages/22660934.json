He has played in &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball\"&gt;Nippon Professional Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (NPB) for the &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Yakult%20Swallows\"&gt;Tokyo Yakult Swallows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tohoku%20Rakuten%20Golden%20Eagles\"&gt;Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nSato was born in &lt;a href=\"Sendai\"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Miyagi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Miyagi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;. His parents and older brother convinced him to begin playing baseball in the &lt;a href=\"fourth%20grade\"&gt;fourth grade&lt;/a&gt;. (His brother, Hisanori, would later go on to Tohoku High School, where he would become &lt;a href=\"Battery%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batterymates&lt;/a&gt; with current &lt;a href=\"Hokkaido%20Nippon-Ham%20Fighters\"&gt;Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Right-handedness\"&gt;right-hander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Darvish\"&gt;Yu Darvish&lt;/a&gt; as the team's backup &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt;.) He was chosen to the Little League Japanese national team in his first year (the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"seventh%20grade\"&gt;seventh grade&lt;/a&gt; in the United States) at Sendai Municipal North Sendai Junior High School and pitched a &lt;a href=\"no-hitter\"&gt;no-hitter&lt;/a&gt; against the Russian team, but did not play for his &lt;a href=\"Middle%20school\"&gt;school's&lt;/a&gt; baseball team, instead choosing to join the school's &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt; team while playing for a Little Senior team instead.\nHigh school career.\n2005 to Spring 2007.\nSato went on to enroll at Sendai Ikuei Gakuen High School in 2005. Though he failed to reach even when he entered high school and was initially made the backup &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt;, he was clocking by the fall of his first year (&lt;a href=\"tenth%20grade\"&gt;tenth grade&lt;/a&gt;) and began to draw local attention as a &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He led the school to a berth in the 88th National High School Baseball Championship in the summer of his &lt;a href=\"Eleventh%20grade\"&gt;junior year&lt;/a&gt; (2006), &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28G%29%23go%20the%20distance\"&gt;going the distance&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Strikeout\"&gt;striking out&lt;/a&gt; 11 en route to a 5\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"Tokushima%2C%20Tokushima\"&gt;Tokushima&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commercial%20high%20school%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Commercial High School&lt;/a&gt; in the first round as the team's &lt;a href=\"Ace%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;ace pitcher&lt;/a&gt; on 7 August. However, he allowed four &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; on seven &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and five &lt;a href=\"Base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt; despite striking out 13 against &lt;a href=\"Nihon%20University\"&gt;Nihon University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yamagata%2C%20Yamagata\"&gt;Yamagata&lt;/a&gt; Senior High School in the next round, ultimately being charged with the &lt;a href=\"Decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; in a 6\u20133 loss on 13 August.\nSendai Ikuei Gakuen High won the &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dhoku%20region\"&gt;Tohoku Regional&lt;/a&gt; Tournament that fall, securing a berth in the 79th &lt;a href=\"National%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Invitational%20Tournament\"&gt;National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament&lt;/a&gt; that would be held in the spring of 2007. However, while Sato pitched well against Tokoha Gakuen Kikugawa High School in the first round (now as a senior) on 23 March, striking out 14 while allowing just two runs and clocking , his team was held to just one run in a disappointing 2\u20131 loss and first-round exit (Tokoha Gakuen Kikugawa High went on to become the tournament champions).\nSummer 2007.\nAlready viewed as one of the top high school pitchers in the country, Sato pitched well in the regional Miyagi Tournament that summer, throwing 226 pitches in fifteen &lt;a href=\"Shutout%23Baseball\"&gt;shutout&lt;/a&gt; innings in the finals against rival Tohoku High School on 31 July in what ended in a scoreless tie (as per tournament regulations). He started the rematch that ensued the next day (1 August), throwing 148 pitches while holding Tohoku High to two runs in a 6\u20132 &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Win%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;win&lt;/a&gt; and leading the school to a third straight appearance in a &lt;a href=\"High%20school%20baseball%20in%20Japan\"&gt;national tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nSato took the mound against &lt;a href=\"Chiben%20Gakuen\"&gt;Chiben Gakuen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wakayama%2C%20Wakayama\"&gt;Wakayama&lt;/a&gt; Senior High School in the first round of the 89th National High School Baseball Championship that followed on 9 August, holding the team to just two runs while striking out 17 in a 4\u20132 complete-game win. While he gave up a &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; to junior and noted &lt;a href=\"cleanup%20hitter\"&gt;cleanup hitter&lt;/a&gt; Masaki Sakaguchi (currently a third baseman for &lt;a href=\"Tokai%20University\"&gt;Tokai University&lt;/a&gt;) in the sixth &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;, he threw a &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"radar%20gun\"&gt;radar gun&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Koshien%20Stadium\"&gt;Koshien Stadium&lt;/a&gt; clocked at in Sakaguchi's next &lt;a href=\"At%20bat\"&gt;at-bat&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth, tying the highest speed ever recorded in the tournament (since the radar gun began being used in 1980) marked by current &lt;a href=\"Yokohama%20BayStars\"&gt;Yokohama BayStars&lt;/a&gt; right-hander Hayato Terahara as a senior for Nichinan Gakuen High School in 2001. He struck Sakaguchi out looking in that at-bat, throwing a total of 19 pitches clocked at or above in the same game.\nIn the fourth inning of the second-round game against Chiben Gakuen Senior High School (the &lt;a href=\"Nara%20Prefecture\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; champions) on 15 August, Sato threw a pitch clocked at , setting a new tournament record for pitch speed (as per official &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20park\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; radar gun readings). He gave up five &lt;a href=\"Run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; in the very next inning, however, allowing eight hits and five walks in a 5\u20132 complete game &lt;a href=\"Loss%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt;. While he made three appearances in national tournaments during his three-year high school career, he never succeeded in getting past the second round.\nSato was chosen to play in the U.S.\u2212Japan High School Baseball Tournament (organized by the Japanese Educational Resource Center in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Academy\"&gt;Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy&lt;/a&gt;) as a member of the Japanese team later that summer, clocking a new personal-high during the tournament.\nSato was one of the most highly touted players going into the 2007 NPB high school &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28sports%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt;, attracting the attention of &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scouts&lt;/a&gt; for not only his fastball but also his hard &lt;a href=\"Slider%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;slider&lt;/a&gt; and being dubbed one of the \"High School Big Three\" along with &lt;a href=\"Osaka%20Prefecture\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; T\u014din Senior High School &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28S%29%23slugger\"&gt;slugger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sho%20Nakata\"&gt;Sho Nakata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Narita%2C%20Chiba\"&gt;Narita&lt;/a&gt; High School right-hander Yuki Karakawa. The Sendai-based &lt;a href=\"Tohoku%20Rakuten%20Golden%20Eagles\"&gt;Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, Swallows, BayStars, &lt;a href=\"Chunichi%20Dragons\"&gt;Chunichi Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt; all selected Sato with their first-round picks, but the Swallows drew the winning straw, signing him to a base salary of 15 million &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20yen\"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"signing%20bonus\"&gt;signing bonus&lt;/a&gt; of 100 million yen and additional performance-based incentives and presenting him the uniform number 11 on 11 November.\nProfessional career.\n2008.\nIn , his &lt;a href=\"rookie\"&gt;rookie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28sports%29\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;, Sato was assigned to the Swallows' \"ichigun\" (Japanese equivalent of \"major &lt;a href=\"Sports%20league\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;\") team for Spring training, but complained of &lt;a href=\"pain\"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; in his left ankle in late February. While the condition was deemed minor and Sato was cleared to play in &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28sports%29%23Preseason\"&gt;preseason&lt;/a&gt; games, he went 0\u20132 with a 13.50 &lt;a href=\"Earned%20run%20average\"&gt;ERA&lt;/a&gt;, allowing 14 hits in just six &lt;a href=\"Innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent down to the \"nigun\" team (\"&lt;a href=\"minor%20league\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Farm%20team%23Baseball\"&gt;farm team&lt;/a&gt;\") for the season opener. He focused on &lt;a href=\"Physical%20therapy\"&gt;rehabbing&lt;/a&gt; his ankle, coming on in &lt;a href=\"Relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief&lt;/a&gt; in a game against the Giants on 13 April and pitching one scoreless inning in his &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20League%20%28Japanese%20baseball%29\"&gt;Eastern League&lt;/a&gt; debut.\nSato went on to earn a spot in the \"nigun\" team's &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28R%29%23rotation\"&gt;starting rotation&lt;/a&gt;, going 8\u20135 with a 4.17 ERA in 15 &lt;a href=\"Games%20pitched\"&gt;appearances&lt;/a&gt; and striking out 71 in innings before being &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28C%29%23called%20up\"&gt;called up&lt;/a&gt; to the \"ichigun\" team for the first time in late August. He made his professional debut on 30 August, starting a game against the BayStars but giving up six runs (five &lt;a href=\"Earned%20run\"&gt;earned&lt;/a&gt;) on six hits and lasting just innings (the Swallows came back to win the game 9\u20138).\nSato made his second start in a game against the Giants on 6 September, allowing three runs over six innings while striking out eight for the first win of his professional career and snapping the Swallows' eight-game losing streak to the Giants (prompting the Japanese media to dub him the \"Giants Killer\"). However, he was charged with his first loss in his next start against the Giants on 14 September, allowing three runs over six innings while striking out seven (he &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28K%29%23knock\"&gt;knocked in&lt;/a&gt; his first career &lt;a href=\"Run%20batted%20in\"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"sacrifice%20fly\"&gt;sacrifice fly&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth inning).\nOn 8 October, Sato earned his second win of the season against the BayStars, holding the team to one run on just two hits over eight innings. While &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shigeru%20Takada\"&gt;Shigeru Takada&lt;/a&gt; considered sending Sato to the mound for the ninth, he opted against it after Sato told &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28baseball%29%23Pitching%20and%20bullpen%20coaches\"&gt;pitching coach&lt;/a&gt; Daisuke Araki that he would rather retain his eligibility for the Most Valuable Rookie award for the following season than earn his first complete-game win. (Sato's innings pitched total at the \"ichigun\" level at the end of the eighth inning was , just under the 30 that a player must not have exceeded for his career to be eligible for the award.)\nSato finished the year with a 2\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Pitchers%20of%20record\"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; in five &lt;a href=\"Games%20started\"&gt;starts&lt;/a&gt; (six appearances), recording a 4.55 ERA while striking out 28 in innings. His eight wins with the \"nigun\" team also led the Eastern League.\n2009.\nSato pitched well in the pre-season, going 1\u20130 with one &lt;a href=\"Save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; with a 2.37 ERA in four appearances, and was considered one of the favorites for the &lt;a href=\"Central%20League\"&gt;Central League&lt;/a&gt; Most Valuable Rookie award going into the season. He threw a pitch clocked at , his fastest since becoming a pro, in his third appearance against the &lt;a href=\"Saitama%20Seibu%20Lions\"&gt;Saitama Seibu Lions&lt;/a&gt; on 19 March.\nSato took the mound in the Swallows' second game of the season against the &lt;a href=\"Hanshin%20Tigers\"&gt;Hanshin Tigers&lt;/a&gt; on 4 April, holding them to one run over six innings in his first win of the season, but gave up a career-high seven runs (all earned) on nine hits over just innings in his next start against the BayStars on 10 April.\nWhile he threw a pitch clocked at a personal-high in his fourth start against the BayStars on 26 April, Sato walked four and gave up three runs in just one inning in the shortest outing of his career. He was removed from the active &lt;a href=\"Schedule%20%28workplace%29\"&gt;roster&lt;/a&gt; and sent down to the minors the following day.\nOn 2 December 2020, he become a free agent.\nPitching style.\nListed at and , Sato is relatively small for a prototypical &lt;a href=\"power%20pitcher\"&gt;power pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. He has a slightly unorthodox &lt;a href=\"Pitching%20position\"&gt;delivery&lt;/a&gt;, raising his left leg and bringing his &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20glove\"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt; down in front of his knee before pulling it into his chest and throwing from a three-quarters &lt;a href=\"Pitcher%23Pitching%20in%20a%20game\"&gt;arm slot&lt;/a&gt;.\nSato's &lt;a href=\"four-seam%20fastball\"&gt;four-seam fastball&lt;/a&gt; has exceptional velocity, usually sitting at and reaching with one pitch during the 2010 season. Sato complements the pitch with a solid slider at low-80s and an occasional &lt;a href=\"forkball\"&gt;forkball&lt;/a&gt;. Sato can be considered as a two-pitch pitcher and still has a problem in his control.\nSato has excellent &lt;a href=\"Endurance\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, clocking with his final pitch in his 154-pitch complete-game win against Chiben Gakuen Wakayama Senior High in the National High School Baseball Championship as an 18-year-old, but leaves room for improvement with his command."
