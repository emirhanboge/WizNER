    "title": "Slow journalism",
    "text": "Slow journalism is a news subculture borne out of the frustration at the quality of &lt;a href=\"journalism\"&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"mainstream%20press\"&gt;mainstream press&lt;/a&gt;. A continuation from the larger &lt;a href=\"Slow%20movement%20%28culture%29\"&gt;\"slow\" movement&lt;/a&gt;, slow journalism shares the same values as other \"slow\"-movement subsets in its efforts to produce a good, clean and fair product. Specialist titles have emerged around the world and proclaim to be antidotes to a mainstream media that is \"filled to the brim with reprinted press releases, kneejerk punditry, &lt;a href=\"advertorial\"&gt;advertorial&lt;/a&gt; nonsense and '&lt;a href=\"churnalism\"&gt;churnalism&lt;/a&gt;'\". Instead, slow journalism tends to focus on long reports and in-depth investigations.\nIn 2007, academic and former journalist Susan Greenberg gave the name 'Slow Journalism' to describe storytelling that gives equal value to narrative craft and factual discovery, taking 'time to find things out, notice stories that others miss, and communicate it all to the highest standards'. This article, published in the UK monthly magazine Prospect on 25 February 2007, was later cited as the original source for the term in the Oxford Dictionary of Journalism (Oxford: OUP, 2014).\nIn 2011, Professor Peter Laufer wrote \"Slow News: A Manifesto for the Critical News Consumer\", published by &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20State%20University%20Press\"&gt;Oregon State University Press&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2018, Jennifer Rauch, educator and researcher focusing on alternative media, media activism and popular culture, wrote the book \"Slow Media: Why Slow is Satisfying, Sustainable &amp; Smart\", published by &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University%20Press\"&gt;Oxford University Press&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 2019, Daniele Nalbone (an &lt;a href=\"Italian%20People\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist) and Alberto Puliafito (an Italian journalist, writer and director, editor in chief of the Italian digital newspaper \"Slow News\"), wrote the book \"Slow Journalism - Chi ha ucciso il giornalismo?\", published by Fandango Libri.\nIn March 2020, Alberto Puliafito directed the documentary \"Slow News\", produced by Fulvio Nebbia and internationally distributed by Java Films."
