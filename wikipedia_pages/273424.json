    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, an anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress) is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from &lt;a href=\"secular%20society\"&gt;secular society&lt;/a&gt; so as to be able to lead an intensely &lt;a href=\"prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt;-oriented, &lt;a href=\"ascetic\"&gt;ascetic&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Eucharist\"&gt;Eucharist&lt;/a&gt;-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious &lt;a href=\"hermit\"&gt;hermit&lt;/a&gt;, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of &lt;a href=\"consecration\"&gt;consecration&lt;/a&gt; that closely resembled the &lt;a href=\"funeral%20rite\"&gt;funeral rite&lt;/a&gt;, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20monasticism\"&gt;Christian monasticism&lt;/a&gt;. In the Catholic Church today, it is one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20life%23Other%20forms%20of%20consecrated%20life\"&gt;Other Forms of Consecrated Life&lt;/a&gt;\" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. In &lt;a href=\"England%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval England&lt;/a&gt;, the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century. Their highest number\u2014around 200 anchorites\u2014were recorded in the 13th century.\nFrom the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.\nBetween 1536 and 1539, the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries\"&gt;dissolution of the monasteries&lt;/a&gt; ordered by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII of England&lt;/a&gt; effectively brought the anchorite tradition to an end.\nAnchoritic life.\nThe anchoritic life became widespread during the early and high &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of the dwellings of anchorites and anchoresses survive, a large number of which are in England. They tended to be a simple cell (also called \"anchorhold\"), built against one of the walls of the local village church. In &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic-speaking&lt;/a&gt; areas, from at least the 10th century, it was customary for the bishop to say \"&lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;The Office of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;\" as the anchorite entered their cell, to signify the anchorite's death to the world and rebirth to a spiritual life of solitary communion with God and the angels. Sometimes, if the anchorite was walled up inside the cell, the bishop would put his seal upon the wall to stamp it with his authority. Some anchorites, however, freely moved between their cells and the adjoining churches.\nMost anchoritic strongholds were small, perhaps no more than square, with three windows. Viewing the altar, hearing &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt;, and receiving the &lt;a href=\"Eucharist\"&gt;Eucharist&lt;/a&gt; were possible through one small, shuttered window in the common wall facing the sanctuary, called a \"&lt;a href=\"hagioscope\"&gt;hagioscope&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"squint\". Anchorites provided &lt;a href=\"spiritual%20direction\"&gt;spiritual advice&lt;/a&gt; and counsel to visitors through these windows, gaining a reputation for &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%23Religious%20perspectives\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. Another small window allowed access to those who saw to the anchorite's physical needs. A third window, often facing the street but covered with translucent cloth, allowed light into the cell.\nAnchorites committed to a life of uncompromising enclosure. Those who considered leaving perhaps believed their souls may be damned for spiritual dereliction. Some refused to leave their cells even when &lt;a href=\"piracy\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; or looters were pillaging their towns, and consequently burned to death when the church was torched. They ate frugal meals, spending their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Their body waste was managed by means of a &lt;a href=\"chamber%20pot\"&gt;chamber pot&lt;/a&gt;. Some anchorholds had a few small rooms, or attached gardens. Servants tended to the basic needs of anchorites, providing food and water, and removing waste. &lt;a href=\"Julian%20of%20Norwich\"&gt;Julian of Norwich&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is known to have had several maidservants, among them Sara and Alice. &lt;a href=\"Aelred%20of%20Rievaulx\"&gt;Aelred of Rievaulx&lt;/a&gt; wrote an anchorite rule book, , for his recluse sister, titled \"De Institutione Inclusarum\"; in it, he suggested keeping no housemates other than an old woman, to act as companion and doorkeeper, and a young maid as domestic servant.\nIn addition to being the physical location wherein the anchorite could embark on a journey toward union with God, the anchorhold also provided a spiritual and geographic focus for people from the wider society seeking spiritual advice and guidance. Though set apart from the community at large by stone walls and specific spiritual precepts, the anchorite lay at the very centre of the community. The anchorhold has been called a communal \"womb\" from which would emerge an idealized sense of a community's own reborn potential, both as Christians and as human subjects.\nInfluential texts.\nAn idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic rule. The most widely known today is the early 13th-century text known as \"&lt;a href=\"Ancrene%20Wisse\"&gt;Ancrene Wisse&lt;/a&gt;\". Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as \"De Institutione Inclusarum\" written in the 12th\u00a0century, around 1160\u20131162, by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister. It is estimated that the daily set devotions detailed in \"Ancrene Wisse\" would take some four hours, on top of which anchoresses would listen to services in the church and engage in their own private prayers and devotional reading.\n&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rolle\"&gt;Richard Rolle&lt;/a&gt;, an English hermit and mystic, wrote one of the most influential guide books regarding the life of an anchoress. His book, \"The Form of Living\", was addressed to a young anchoress named &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Kirkby\"&gt;Margaret Kirkby&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for preserving his texts. Her connection to the town of Hampole has been commonly associated with Rolle; he is sometimes referred to as '&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rolle%20of%20Hampole\"&gt;Richard Rolle of Hampole&lt;/a&gt;' despite a lack of conclusive evidence that Rolle indeed was ever in the small village.\nNotable anchorites.\nThe earliest recorded anchorites lived in the 3rd\u00a0century AD. For example, &lt;a href=\"Hilarion\"&gt;Hilarion&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gaza%20Strip\"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;, 291 \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, 371) was known as the founder of anchoritic life in &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe anchoritic life proved popular in England, where women outnumbered men in the ranks of the anchorites, especially in the 13th\u00a0century. The evidence supports the existence of a total of around 780\u00a0anchorites on 600\u00a0sites between 1100 and 1539, when the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries\"&gt;Dissolution of the Monasteries&lt;/a&gt; ordered by Henry\u00a0VIII brought anchoritism in England to an end. English anchorholds can still be seen at &lt;a href=\"Chester-le-Street\"&gt;Chester-le-Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Hartlip\"&gt;Hartlip&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther anchorites included &lt;a href=\"Calogerus%20the%20Anchorite\"&gt;Calogerus the Anchorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyriacus%20the%20Anchorite\"&gt;Cyriacus the Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;."
