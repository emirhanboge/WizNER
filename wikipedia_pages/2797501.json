    "text": "Maianthemum dilatatum (snakeberry, two-leaved Solomon's seal or false lily of the valley) is a common &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizomatous&lt;/a&gt; perennial &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; that is native to western North America from northern &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20islands\"&gt;Aleutian islands&lt;/a&gt;, and Asia across the &lt;a href=\"Kamchatka%20Peninsula\"&gt;Kamchatka Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It grows in coastal &lt;a href=\"temperate%20rainforest\"&gt;temperate rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s, and is often the dominant groundcover plant in &lt;a href=\"Sitka%20Spruce\"&gt;Sitka Spruce&lt;/a&gt; forests.\nDescription.\nThe plant produces an erect, unbranched flower stem, occasionally to 40 centimeters in height, but typically much shorter. A non-flowering shoot bears one smooth, waxy, shiny leaf up to 10 centimeters long and 5 to 8 cm broad, hence its &lt;a href=\"scientific%20name\"&gt;scientific name&lt;/a&gt; (\"dilatatum\" means 'broad'). The leaf is oval in shape with a heart-shaped base.\nThe &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; is an erect &lt;a href=\"raceme\"&gt;raceme&lt;/a&gt; with star-shaped white flowers. They each have four &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s and four &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s. After fertilization the fruit produced is a &lt;a href=\"Berry%20%28botany%29\"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt; 6 millimeters in diameter. The berry is speckled red when immature and solid red when ripe. Each has 1 to 4 seeds.\nUses.\nThe plant has many &lt;a href=\"Ethnobotany\"&gt;ethnobotanical&lt;/a&gt; uses. The roots and leaves were used &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;medicinally&lt;/a&gt;, and the berries were occasionally used for food. Native Americans used the plant to treat wounds and eyestrain.\nBeing tolerant of deep shade, drought, and extensive watering, the plant is becoming more popular as a shade &lt;a href=\"groundcover\"&gt;groundcover&lt;/a&gt; in gardening. Care should be taken when using it in gardens as it can quickly escape confines with its creeping rhizomes and may crowd out other plants."
