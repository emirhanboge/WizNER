    "text": "USS \"Arapaho\" (AT-68/ATF-68) was a &lt;a href=\"fleet%20ocean%20tug\"&gt;fleet ocean tug&lt;/a&gt; which served the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; with her towing services. She was assigned initially to support the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Atlantic%20Fleet\"&gt;U.S. Atlantic Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, and was eventually assigned to support Allied forces in the war zones of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in her crew returning home after the war with four &lt;a href=\"battle%20stars\"&gt;battle stars&lt;/a&gt; to their credit.\nUS Navy career.\nThe second ship to be so named by the Navy, \"Arapaho\" (AT-68) was laid down on 8 November 1941 at &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, by the Charleston Shipbuilding &amp; Dry-dock Company; launched on 22 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Alice Posey Hatcher; and commissioned on 20 January 1943, Lt. E. H. Wootan in command.\nWorld War II service.\nEast coast operations.\nThe tug conducted her &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28testing%29\"&gt;shakedown&lt;/a&gt; training in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Key%20West%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Key West, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and returned to &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, to prepare for a &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20crossing\"&gt;transatlantic&lt;/a&gt; voyage. On 19 March, she sailed for &lt;a href=\"Casablanca\"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;, Morocco. There, she took the &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;-damaged attack cargo ship &lt;a href=\"USS%20Almaack%20%28AKA-10%29\"&gt;\"Almaack\" (AKA-10)&lt;/a&gt; in tow for the voyage back to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. She and her charge arrived back in &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, on 20 May.\nIn mid-June, the tug moved south to search the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Strait\"&gt;Florida Strait&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"USS%20R-12%20%28SS-89%29\"&gt;\"R-12 (SS-89\")&lt;/a&gt;, which had sunk as a result of battery explosions. After fruitlessly seeking this ship from 18 to 23 June, \"Arapaho\" set sail on 25 June\u2014apparently from &lt;a href=\"Key%20West%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Key West, Florida&lt;/a&gt;\u2014with a barge in tow on her way to &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;. She left the barge in the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Zone\"&gt;Panama Canal Zone&lt;/a&gt; and continued her voyage to &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%2C%20California\"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she arrived on 15 July.\nPacific Ocean operations.\nFor the next three months, the tug conducted towing and salvage operations, first along the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20West%20Coast\"&gt;U.S. West Coast&lt;/a&gt; and then, from early in September, out of &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. On 16 October, \"Arapaho\" departed &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; with two supply lighters in tow, bound for the &lt;a href=\"Ellice%20Islands\"&gt;Ellice Islands&lt;/a&gt;. She reached &lt;a href=\"Funafuti\"&gt;Funafuti&lt;/a&gt; on 30 October and began heavy towing operations between the &lt;a href=\"Ellice%20Islands\"&gt;Ellice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Islands\"&gt;Gilbert Islands&lt;/a&gt;. For a time, she served as an &lt;a href=\"antisubmarine\"&gt;antisubmarine&lt;/a&gt; guard ship at recently captured &lt;a href=\"Tarawa\"&gt;Tarawa&lt;/a&gt; Atoll.\nOn 4 December, \"Arapaho\" embarked 12 civilians who had been liberated from a &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Makin%20Island%2C%20Makin\"&gt;Makin&lt;/a&gt; and set sail\u2014via &lt;a href=\"Funafuti\"&gt;Funafuti&lt;/a&gt;\u2014for &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. From Funafuti, the tug steamed in company with aircraft carrier &lt;a href=\"USS%20Independence%20%28CVL-22%29\"&gt;\"Independence\" (CVL-22)&lt;/a&gt;, severely damaged in the &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Islands\"&gt;Gilbert Islands&lt;/a&gt; operation by an &lt;a href=\"aerial%20torpedo\"&gt;aerial torpedo&lt;/a&gt;. The ships arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 December.\n\"Arapaho\" underwent repairs until near the end of the first week in January 1944. On 6 January, she headed back to the &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Islands\"&gt;Gilberts&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next five months, the tug was based successively at &lt;a href=\"Tarawa\"&gt;Tarawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Majuro\"&gt;Majuro&lt;/a&gt;, though she made numerous tows to other islands in the Gilbert, Marshall, and Ellice groups. By 13 June, she had moved her base of operations to &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt; where she engaged in harbor duty and salvage work. On 3 July, \"Arapaho\" set a course for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on the 9th to begin a month of repairs. She returned to Eniwetok on 26 August and, except for a round-trip voyage to &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, operated there until the second week in October.\nUlithi operations.\nAt that time, she put to sea towing auxiliary repair dock \"ARD-15\" and covered lighter (self-propelled) \"YF-786\" to Ulithi, &lt;a href=\"Service%20Squadron\"&gt;Service Squadron&lt;/a&gt; (ServRon) 10's new advanced base, and, following her arrival at that &lt;a href=\"atoll\"&gt;atoll&lt;/a&gt;, worked in and out of its &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt; engaged in harbor and salvage duties.\nBetween 4 and 10 November, she assisted &lt;a href=\"USS%20Zuni%20%28ATF-95%29\"&gt;\"Zuni\" (ATF-95)&lt;/a&gt; in towing &lt;a href=\"USS%20Reno%20%28CL-96%29\"&gt;\"Reno\" (CL-96)&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Ulithi\"&gt;Ulithi&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt; had been torpedoed by a Japanese &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"San%20Bernardino%20Strait\"&gt;San Bernardino Strait&lt;/a&gt; on the 3d. In December, the tug towed &lt;a href=\"USS%20Houston%20%28CL-81%29\"&gt;\"Houston\" (CL-81)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ulithi\"&gt;Ulithi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Manus%20Island\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20Islands\"&gt;Admiralty Islands&lt;/a&gt;. From there, she towed fuel barge \"YO-186\" to &lt;a href=\"Kossol%20Passage\"&gt;Kossol Passage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20Islands\"&gt;Palau Islands&lt;/a&gt;. After towing &lt;a href=\"USS%20LST-278\"&gt;\"LST-278\"&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; in January 1945, \"Arapaho\" returned to Ulithi on the 23d and began a major overhaul of her main propulsion plant. The ship completed repairs and returned to active duty on 18 March.\nOkinawa operations.\nShe operated out of Ulithi until mid-June when she moved to Guam. From there, the tug headed for &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; on 5 July with auxiliary repair dock \"ARD-26\" in tow. \"Arapaho\" and the auxiliary repair dock arrived in &lt;a href=\"Kerama%20Retto\"&gt;Kerama Retto&lt;/a&gt; 10 days later. The tug remained at &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; until after the end of hostilities in mid-August. Late that month, she voyaged back to Guam to pick up \"ARD-21\" for tow to Okinawa. She returned to Kerama Retto with her charge on 7 September and resumed local towing duty.\nEnd-of-war decommissioning.\nThat assignment continued until 9 November 1945 when she began the long journey back to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. She stopped at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for a few days early in December and arrived in &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;San Pedro, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, on 27th. \"Arapaho\" remained at San Pedro assigned to the inactive fleet awaiting inactivation overhaul for a little more than a year. On 8 and 9 January 1947, she was towed to &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%2C%20California\"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she was decommissioned on 15 January 1947. She remained with the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Reserve%20Fleet\"&gt;Pacific Reserve Fleet&lt;/a&gt; until July 1961. On 1 July 1961, her name was struck from the &lt;a href=\"Navy%20list\"&gt;Navy list&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonors and awards.\n\"Arapaho\" (ATF-68) earned four &lt;a href=\"battle%20stars\"&gt;battle stars&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgentine Navy career.\nOn 10 July 1961, she was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Navy\"&gt;Argentine Navy&lt;/a&gt;, which commissioned her that same day as ARA \"Comandante General Zapiola\". The tug remained active with the Argentine Navy until 10 January 1976 when she ran aground on an &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctic&lt;/a&gt; reef and was declared a total loss. Her crew was rescued by the Chilean patrol boat \"Piloto Pardo\"."
