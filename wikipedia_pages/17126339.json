    "text": "The jacky dragon (\"Amphibolurus muricatus\") is a type of &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; native to southeastern &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the first Australian &lt;a href=\"reptiles\"&gt;reptiles&lt;/a&gt; to be named, originally described by English zoologist &lt;a href=\"George%20Shaw%20%28biologist%29\"&gt;George Shaw&lt;/a&gt; in Surgeon-General &lt;a href=\"John%20White%20%28surgeon%29\"&gt;John White&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales\", which was published in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 1790. It is well known for its bright yellow mouth and well-developed &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebral&lt;/a&gt; crest, as well as the &lt;a href=\"temperature-dependent%20sex%20determination\"&gt;temperature-dependent sex determination&lt;/a&gt; of its offspring. Other common names include blood-sucker, stonewalker, and tree dragon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wergaia%20language\"&gt;Wergaia&lt;/a&gt; people of the &lt;a href=\"Wimmera\"&gt;Wimmera&lt;/a&gt; region of north-western Victoria call it \"nganurganity\". In 2017, the star &lt;a href=\"Sigma%20Canis%20Majoris\"&gt;Sigma Canis Majoris&lt;/a&gt; was officially named \"Unurgunite\" (a 19th-century transcription of \"nganurganity\") due to its identification with the jacky dragon in Wergaia traditions.\nTaxonomy.\nThe jacky dragon, one of the 70 species of dragons (Agamidae) found in Australia, is generally &lt;a href=\"Diurnality\"&gt;diurnal&lt;/a&gt; and tends to run in an upright posture when pursued. Common morphological characteristics include rough, nonglossy &lt;a href=\"Scale%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt;; broad, thick, and fleshy &lt;a href=\"tongue\"&gt;tongue&lt;/a&gt;s; and well-developed limbs, especially hind limbs which are generally longer and have five-clawed digits. Most dragons are also characterized by a lack of tail &lt;a href=\"autotomy\"&gt;autotomy&lt;/a&gt; and the presence of &lt;a href=\"Femoral%20artery\"&gt;femoral&lt;/a&gt; and/or preanal pores. Agamidae dragons are also &lt;a href=\"oviparous\"&gt;oviparous&lt;/a&gt; and tend to deposit their eggs in burrows.\nMorphology.\nThe coloration of the jacky dragon is pale &lt;a href=\"grey\"&gt;grey&lt;/a&gt; to dark &lt;a href=\"brown\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; with dark patches along the middle of the back. The dark patches are interrupted by pale blotches that often blend together to form a continuous stripe from above the arm to the groin. A dark brown bar is present between the &lt;a href=\"eye\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ear\"&gt;ear&lt;/a&gt;, but no dark stripe is present between the nostril and the eye as in many other dragons. The lips and lower &lt;a href=\"jaw\"&gt;jaw&lt;/a&gt; tend to be of a lighter coloration than the rest of the head. Jacky dragons are also characterized by a bright yellow lining in their mouths. .\nSpecimens have been seen with orange-red corners of the inside of their mouths, which may have given rise to the common name of blood-sucker.\nThe jacky dragon is more readily distinguishable by its five crests: a &lt;a href=\"nuchal\"&gt;nuchal&lt;/a&gt; crest continuous with a &lt;a href=\"vertebrae\"&gt;vertebral&lt;/a&gt; series of enlarged scales; paravertebral series from the nape to the base of the tail, which is separated from the vertebral series by two or three scales; and a dorsolateral series on each side. The hind legs are covered in large, &lt;a href=\"spinose\"&gt;spinose&lt;/a&gt; scales and small, keeled scales. Jacky dragons also have spinose scales on the sides of their necks. The &lt;a href=\"tympanum%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;tympanum&lt;/a&gt; is medium-sized and fairly conspicuous. \nThe average size of a jacky dragon is 9\u00a0in (22.86\u00a0cm) including the tail, though they have been recorded at lengths up to 17.5\u00a0in (44.45\u00a0cm). The length of the tail is generally twice as long as that of the body. The average mass of the jacky dragon is 30\u00a0g. The largest dragons, however, have been recorded at around 67\u00a0g. The size of the dragons' heads can be used to differentiate between sexes, with males usually having conspicuously larger heads.\nReproduction and life cycle.\n&lt;a href=\"Gravid\"&gt;Gravid&lt;/a&gt; females are found from October until February. Females lay up to eight eggs. &lt;a href=\"Clutch%20%28eggs%29\"&gt;Clutch&lt;/a&gt; size tends to be positively correlated with female body size. Most adult females lay at least one clutch every summer. They tend to lay their clutches under sheets of bark or decaying vegetation over sandy deposits. The first young begin to appear at the end of December and are abundant by February. Jacky dragons are usually about three inches in length immediately following hatching.\nThe sex of the hatchlings is determined by the temperature of the nest, a process known as temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). The hatchlings are females in low- and high-temperature environments and males in medium-temperature environments. This causes young dragons from clutches laid earlier in the season to be predominately male. Shine suggests, however, that the sex of the hatchling is determined soon after &lt;a href=\"oviposition\"&gt;oviposition&lt;/a&gt; when the mother still has considerable control over the temperature of the nest. This may falsify the &lt;a href=\"hypothesis\"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that TSD evolved in lizards so as to match the sex of the offspring with environmental conditions that may be unpredictable when the clutch is laid, as is most likely the case for &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tuatara\"&gt;tuatara&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crocodile\"&gt;crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s. In fact, recent research suggests TSD has evolved in lizards so as to ensure reproductive success in the offspring.\nThe jacky dragon reaches sexual maturity rapidly. Females can lay clutches within one year of hatching. The average lifespan of the jacky dragon is four years, which is significantly shorter than most lizards.\nEcology.\nDistribution.\nJacky dragons are found along the southeastern coast of Australia. They have been found as far north as central &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, and in the southeastern portion of &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHabitat.\nThe jacky dragon is usually found in dry &lt;a href=\"sclerophyll\"&gt;sclerophyll&lt;/a&gt; forests and woodlands. They are present in the eastern highlands, but not in alpine areas. They are semiarboreal, and individuals are often seen perching on fallen or standing timber.\nPredators and Prey.\n&lt;a href=\"Insects\"&gt;Insects&lt;/a&gt; compose most of the diet of the jacky dragon. These include &lt;a href=\"flies\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moths\"&gt;moths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"caterpillars\"&gt;caterpillars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s, and small &lt;a href=\"beetles\"&gt;beetles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPredators of young jacky dragons are numerous and can include small &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, such as feral &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s. Adults face aerial predation from &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"kookaburra\"&gt;kookaburra&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"black-shouldered%20kite\"&gt;black-shouldered kite&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Nankeen%20kestrel\"&gt;Nankeen kestrel&lt;/a&gt;s. The dragons use visual cues such as the changing area over time, edge length, shape, and orientation in the recognition of aerial predators.\nBehaviour.\nJacky dragons are very swift lizards and like many other dragons (Agamidae), will sometimes run in an almost upright position on their hind legs when pursued. In cool, wet weather, they bury themselves in the sand or shelter under a bush. They rarely enter the water, but do have the ability to swim. In a fight, opponents circle each other in an upright position with their bodies laterally compressed so as to enlarge their appearance. They tend to direct their attacks towards the tails of their opponents. Various territorial displays include tail-waving, raising or lowering their bodies, head-bobbing, arm-waving, and darkening their color.\nJacky dragons have many different displays, or series of movements, that are used as communication between &lt;a href=\"conspecifics\"&gt;conspecifics&lt;/a&gt;. The push-up display, for example, begins with a series of tail flicks, backward and forward arm-waves, a push-up and a characteristic rocking of the entire body. These unique movements have velocity and directional characteristics that distinguish them from other environmental occurrences such as the blowing of vegetation. This is necessary because the visual system of the jacky dragon relies mostly on movement for information.\nConservation status.\nThe jacky dragon is not in danger of &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt;. The abundance of the jacky dragon and other common &lt;a href=\"reptiles\"&gt;reptiles&lt;/a&gt; is a result of the heterogeneity and structural complexity of the ground and groundcover of undisturbed areas, which is an important observation in the conservation of reptiles in Australia."
