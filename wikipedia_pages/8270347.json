    "text": "The Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War travelled to fight for the Finns after the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939. For a variety of reasons, volunteers from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%931946%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; fought on the side of Finland during the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; (1939\u20131940) against the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nHungarian-Finnish Relationship before and after World War I.\nAt the end of the 19th century the &lt;a href=\"Finno-Ugric%20languages\"&gt;Finno-Ugric linguistic affinity&lt;/a&gt; became widely accepted after extensive public debate. Some &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20people\"&gt;Magyar&lt;/a&gt; scientists (e.g. &lt;a href=\"oriental%20studies\"&gt;orientalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%C3%81rmin%20V%C3%A1mb%C3%A9ry\"&gt;\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry&lt;/a&gt;) and intellectuals (e.g. &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20Arany\"&gt;Arany J\u00e1nos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B3r%20J%C3%B3kai\"&gt;J\u00f3kai M\u00f3r&lt;/a&gt;) were unable to accept that the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20people\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; nation had family relations in Northern &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. To them, relationships with the &lt;a href=\"Hun\"&gt;Hun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic peoples&lt;/a&gt; seemed much more plausible, mainly in the years of the Hungarian millennium around 1896. At this time the Finnish people, living in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Tsarist Russia&lt;/a&gt;, were receptive to the idea of Finno-Ugric affinity and regarded the proud and freedom-loving Hungarian nation as an ideal.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; became independent, but &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; lost the war and roughly two-thirds of its territory as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Trianon\"&gt;Treaty of Trianon&lt;/a&gt;. One-third of Hungarians were suddenly left outside Hungary's borders, as it became increasingly isolated. &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few European countries that felt sympathy towards Hungary. Hungarians in turn, then regarded newly independent and &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; Finland as an ideal. Because of this, good connections formed between the two &lt;a href=\"country\"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; during the 1920s.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; broke out between Finland and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, many Hungarians felt great sympathy towards the Finns and wanted to help them.\nHungarian support to Finland.\nThe Hungarian &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; officially did not support Finland, but secretly started searching for ways of helping. In addition, non-governmental organisations began to organize support for Finland. &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; helped Finland by giving monetary &lt;a href=\"donations\"&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armaments\"&gt;armaments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"military%20volunteer\"&gt;military volunteer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hungarian-Finnish%20Association\"&gt;Hungarian-Finnish Association&lt;/a&gt; began to organize nationwide collections in the first days of December as \u201c\"Brother for brother\"\u201d and \u201c\"Hungarian Mothers for Finnish Children\"\u201d. Collecting of donations and clothes was organised by the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cross\"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, which also organized the shipment of this aid to Finland. &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi\"&gt;Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi&lt;/a&gt; offered all of his prize money to &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1l%20Teleki\"&gt;P\u00e1l Teleki&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s government sent armaments and war equipment valued at 1 &lt;a href=\"million\"&gt;million&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20peng%C5%91\"&gt;Hungarian peng\u0151&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s during the Winter War (with knowledge and accord of &lt;a href=\"Regent%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Regent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy%20de%20Nagyb%C3%A1nya\"&gt;Mikl\u00f3s Horthy de Nagyb\u00e1nya&lt;/a&gt;). It contained 36 &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20guns\"&gt;anti-aircraft guns&lt;/a&gt; with 10,250 cartridges, 16 &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;mortars&lt;/a&gt; with 32,240 &lt;a href=\"Shell%20%28projectile%29\"&gt;shells&lt;/a&gt;, 300 &lt;a href=\"rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;s with 520,000 cartridges, 30 armor-piercing rifles with 3,300 cartridges (taken from the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20army\"&gt;Polish army&lt;/a&gt;), 300,000 hand &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, 3,654 land &lt;a href=\"Land%20Mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, 93,680 helmets, 223 military &lt;a href=\"transceivers\"&gt;transceivers&lt;/a&gt;, and 26,000 bandoleers.\nThe recruiting of volunteers started on 16 December with the printing of recruitment leaflets. The acts of Teleki\u2019s government were motivated on one hand by helping a related nation, and on the other hand by the staunch &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-Soviet\"&gt;anti-Soviet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attitude%20%28psychology%29\"&gt;attitude&lt;/a&gt; of the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;.\nHungarian Volunteer Detached Battalion.\nThe volunteers.\nDuring the Winter War, around 25,000 Hungarian men applied to fight in Finland. The applicants underwent a strenuous selection process: the only applications accepted were from unmarried men who had already completed their obligatory &lt;a href=\"military%20service\"&gt;military service&lt;/a&gt;, had no criminal record, and were not &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; sympathizers.\nFinally, 350 applications were accepted who were mainly from the environs of &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagykanizsa\"&gt;Nagykanizsa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Debrecen\"&gt;Debrecen&lt;/a&gt;. They were mostly between 18 and 30 years old.\nTheir military training started on 10 January and took almost a month. The volunteers formed a &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imre%20K%C3%A9meri%20Nagy\"&gt;Imre K\u00e9meri Nagy&lt;/a&gt;. The Hungarian Volunteer Detached Battalion had 24 &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt;s, 52 &lt;a href=\"non-commissioned%20officer\"&gt;non-commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;s, 2 &lt;a href=\"Physician\"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and 2 &lt;a href=\"Military%20Chaplain\"&gt;padres&lt;/a&gt;; a total of 346 officers and men.\nGoing to Finland.\nTravel to Finland was very difficult, because the &lt;a href=\"German%20Reich\"&gt;German Reich&lt;/a&gt; forbade transit of armaments and war equipment across its territory (including the occupied &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; territories). This was in one respect a simple honoring of the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact\"&gt;Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact&lt;/a&gt;, but was also because Teleki had not given the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; permission to use Hungarian &lt;a href=\"railway\"&gt;railway&lt;/a&gt; lines for attacking &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. The German government was also unhappy that Teleki's government had harbored thousands of Polish &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s after the German and Soviet invasion of Poland because of the &lt;a href=\"Pole%20and%20Hungarian%20brothers%20be\"&gt;Hungarian\u2013Polish friendship&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of this, volunteers had to travel across &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; to make their way to Finland. They travelled without any &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; by a special &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;, officially classified as \"tourists going to ski-camp\". The battalion was embarked at &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt; as a part of a &lt;a href=\"convoy\"&gt;convoy&lt;/a&gt;. This convoy had to be protected by &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; and naval cover because the United Kingdom and the German Reich were in a state of &lt;a href=\"war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; and there was great fear of German attacks (\"&lt;a href=\"Phony%20War\"&gt;Phony War&lt;/a&gt;\"). Finally the battalion arrived in Finland on 2 March after three weeks' travelling.\nIn Finland.\nIn Finland the battalion was quartered in &lt;a href=\"Lapua\"&gt;Lapua&lt;/a&gt;, in the training center of the international volunteers. In Lapua they took a part in another &lt;a href=\"Military%20education%20and%20training\"&gt;military training&lt;/a&gt;, learned &lt;a href=\"ski\"&gt;ski&lt;/a&gt;ing and winter warfare. Before the Hungarian battalion could see military action, the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty\"&gt;Moscow Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt; was signed, on 12 March in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, so many volunteers were frustrated.\nIn the last days of March, &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal\"&gt;Field Marshal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Gustaf%20Emil%20Mannerheim\"&gt;Mannerheim&lt;/a&gt; visited Lapua where he met the Hungarian battalion. He expressed his thanks to the volunteers for coming to Finland and he promoted Lieutenant Imre K\u00e9meri Nagy to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; (this promotion was later accepted by the Hungarian General Staff). From 17 April to 19 May the Hungarian battalion served in &lt;a href=\"Karelia\"&gt;Karelia&lt;/a&gt;, at the new state &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lappeenranta\"&gt;Lappeenranta&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoing back to Hungary.\nThe Hungarian battalion was embarked at &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; on 20 May 1940, from where a &lt;a href=\"steamboat\"&gt;steamboat&lt;/a&gt; sailed to &lt;a href=\"Stettin\"&gt;Stettin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20Reich\"&gt;German Reich&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Szczecin\"&gt;Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;). In Turku the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20White%20Rose%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Order of the White Rose of Finland&lt;/a&gt; was given to the Hungarian &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt;s. They travelled across &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; by a special train with a German guard. The German government gave them special permission to use the German railway lines in order to reach Hungary. Expenses of the homeward travel were paid by the Finnish Ministry of Defence. The volunteers arrived at &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; on 28 May. They were welcomed by the &lt;a href=\"prime%20minister\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;, Count P\u00e1l Teleki.\nOther Hungarian volunteers in the Winter War.\nOutside the \"Hungarian Volunteer Detached Battalion\" other Hungarian volunteers fought in the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20army\"&gt;Finnish army&lt;/a&gt; as individuals. &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Lieutenant\"&gt;2nd Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Pirityi served in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Finnish Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and took part in more than 20 sorties. &lt;a href=\"Warrant%20Officer\"&gt;Warrant Officer&lt;/a&gt; Vilmos B\u00e9k\u00e1ssy's plane disappeared over the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Bothnia\"&gt;Gulf of Bothnia&lt;/a&gt;. G\u00e9za Szepessy, along with four fellows from the Military Technical College of Berlin, went to Finland where he was wounded in action.\nMemory of the Hungarian volunteers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"regime\"&gt;regime&lt;/a&gt; (between 1949 and 1989) the &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of the Hungarian volunteer &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; could not be studied (the list of the volunteers\u2019 names was found in Finland). Survivors today are well over 90 years old. They could only orally recount their experiences during that time, therefore proper research of the battalion\u2019s history could only start in the 1990s.\nMany volunteers fell in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and some died of old age. From 1991 the Finnish and Hungarian veterans have been able to meet and visit each other. These meetings are supported in part by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence. In 1991 medallions were given to surviving Hungarian &lt;a href=\"veteran\"&gt;veteran&lt;/a&gt;s at the Finnish Embassy in Budapest.\nThe memory of the Hungarian volunteers has been preserved by memorial tablets in &lt;a href=\"Lapua\"&gt;Lapua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lappeenranta\"&gt;Lappeenranta&lt;/a&gt;, in Finland."
