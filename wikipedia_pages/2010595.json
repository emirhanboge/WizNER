    "text": "\"False Profits\" is the 47th episode of ', the fifth episode of the . This is a science fiction television episode of the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Trek\"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; franchise, that aired on &lt;a href=\"UPN\"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt; on October 2, 1996. The episode functions as a sequel to the ' episode \"\" (1989).\nStarship Voyager is making its way back home, after being flung to the other side of the Galaxy. The crew is surprised to find some Ferengi there. The episode takes advantage of the shared universe of Star Trek, using elements introduced in a previous television show.\nPlot.\n&lt;a href=\"USS%20Voyager%20%28Star%20Trek%29\"&gt;USS \"Voyager\"&lt;/a&gt; detects an unstable &lt;a href=\"wormhole\"&gt;wormhole&lt;/a&gt; whose exit point is traced to the &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Quadrant\"&gt;Alpha Quadrant&lt;/a&gt;. This would be a shortcut home for \"Voyager\"; the only problem is that the Delta Quadrant side moves around erratically. While Harry Kim and B'Elanna Torres work on a way to stabilize the wormhole, Tuvok investigates a nearby planet called Takar with a &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; civilization. He is surprised to discover evidence of &lt;a href=\"replicator%20%28Star%20Trek%29\"&gt;replicator&lt;/a&gt; technology there.\nChakotay and Paris beam down to investigate. They discover two &lt;a href=\"Ferengi\"&gt;Ferengi&lt;/a&gt; posing as demigods who were foretold in the planet's mythology. Years ago, as told in the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"\", they had come through the wormhole, and since it was unstable, had been unable to go back. Instead they had decided to exploit the replicator technology to make themselves rich. When the Ferengi are beamed aboard Voyager, they refuse to go back through the wormhole and point out the harm to the natives' religion if they simply disappeared. Janeway is forced to return them to the planet.\nNeelix, disguised as a Ferengi, travels back to the planet. He pretends to be a representative (the \"Grand Proxy\") of the Ferengi ruler, the Grand Nagus, and demands the two return to the Alpha Quadrant so he may confiscate their riches. His ruse is uncovered and the Ferengi attempt to kill him. Neelix barely survives the assault and is left among the natives. However, the \"Voyager\" crew has learned the end of the native mythology \u2014 Neelix announces himself as the \"Holy Pilgrim\", a character prophesied to return the sages to their home. He coordinates with \"Voyager\" to create signs of his authenticity, which incites the natives to attempt to burn him and the Ferengi at the stake, citing a passage prophesying that they will return home on \"wings of fire\". Neelix and the Ferengi are beamed away at the last moment and the natives are convinced their prophecy has come true.\nThe \"Voyager\" crew succeed in stablizing the wormhole, but the Ferengi manage to steal back their shuttlecraft, which \"Voyager\" had confiscated. Their attempts to escape back to Takar end with them being sucked into the wormhole, destabilizing at both openings to the point that it is worthless to \"Voyager\" and leaving both Ferengi lost in space.\nReception.\nIn 2017, \"&lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Geek\"&gt;Den of Geek&lt;/a&gt;\" included this on their abbreviated watch guide for \"Star Trek: Voyager\", picking out this episode on their cross-overs roadmap.\nIn 2017, Treknews.net felt this was one of the funniest episodes of all Star Trek, and likened the plot to that of another science fiction franchise, &lt;a href=\"Stargate\"&gt;Stargate&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleases.\n\"False Profits\" was released on &lt;a href=\"LaserDisc\"&gt;LaserDisc&lt;/a&gt; in Japan on June 25, 1999, as part of the \"3rd season vol.1\" set.\n\"False Profits\" was released on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; on July 6, 2004 as part of \"Star Trek Voyager: Complete Third Season\", with &lt;a href=\"Dolby%205.1\"&gt;Dolby 5.1&lt;/a&gt; surround audio.
