    "text": "Danes (, ) are a &lt;a href=\"North%20Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;North Germanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20group\"&gt;ethnic group&lt;/a&gt; native to &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and a modern &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; identified with the country of Denmark. This connection may be ancestral, legal, historical, or cultural.\nDanes generally regard themselves as a &lt;a href=\"nationality\"&gt;nationality&lt;/a&gt; and reserve the word \"ethnic\" for the description of recent immigrants, sometimes referred to as \"new Danes\". The contemporary Danish ethnic identity is based on the idea of \"Danishness\", which is founded on principles formed through historical cultural connections and is not based on racial heritage.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\n&lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; has been inhabited by various &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic peoples&lt;/a&gt; since ancient times, including the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cimbri\"&gt;Cimbri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jutes\"&gt;Jutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herules\"&gt;Herules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teutones\"&gt;Teutones&lt;/a&gt; and others. The first mentions of \"&lt;a href=\"Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt;\" are recorded in the mid-6th century by historians &lt;a href=\"Procopius\"&gt;Procopius&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Jordanes\"&gt;Jordanes&lt;/a&gt; (\"dan\u012b\"), who both refer to a tribe related to the &lt;a href=\"Swedes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29\"&gt;Suetidi&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Jutland\"&gt;Jutland&lt;/a&gt;, the province of &lt;a href=\"Scania\"&gt;Scania&lt;/a&gt; and the isles in between. &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt; annalists of the 8th century often refer to Danish kings. The &lt;a href=\"Bobbio%20Orosius\"&gt;Bobbio Orosius&lt;/a&gt; from the early 7th century distinguishes between South Danes inhabiting Jutland and North Danes inhabiting the isles and the province of Scania.\nViking Age.\nThe first mention of Danes within &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; is on the &lt;a href=\"Jelling%20stones%23Runestone%20of%20Harald%20Bluetooth\"&gt;Jelling Rune Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which mentions the conversion of the Danes to &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Bluetooth\"&gt;Harald Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; in the 10th century. Between c. 960 and the early 980s, Bluetooth established a kingdom in the lands of the Danes, stretching from Jutland to Scania. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German &lt;a href=\"missionary\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; who, by surviving an &lt;a href=\"trial%20by%20ordeal\"&gt;ordeal by fire&lt;/a&gt; according to legend, convinced Harold to convert to &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following years saw the Danish &lt;a href=\"Viking%20expansion\"&gt;Viking expansion&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporated &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20England\"&gt;Northern England&lt;/a&gt; into the Danish &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Empire\"&gt;North Sea Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Cnut%20the%20Great\"&gt;Canute the Great&lt;/a&gt; in 1035, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; broke away from Danish control. Canute's nephew &lt;a href=\"Sweyn%20II%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Sweyn Estridson&lt;/a&gt; (1020\u201374) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with the &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Archbishopric%20of%20Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, at that time the archbishop of all &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next centuries, the Danish empire expanded throughout the southern &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; coast. Under the 14th century king &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20II%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Olaf II&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark acquired control of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Norway%20%28872%E2%80%931397%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Norway&lt;/a&gt;, which included the territories of &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faroese%20Islands\"&gt;Faroese Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Olaf's mother, &lt;a href=\"Margrethe%20I\"&gt;Margrethe I&lt;/a&gt;, united Norway, Sweden and Denmark into the &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20Union\"&gt;Kalmar Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nDenmark-Norway.\nIn 1523, Sweden won its independence, leading to the dismantling of the Kalmar Union and the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;Denmark-Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Denmark-Norway grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the &lt;a href=\"%C3%98resund\"&gt;\u00d8resund&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown of Denmark could tax the traffic, because it controlled both sides of the Sound at the time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, which originated in the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; (1483\u20131546), had a considerable impact on Denmark. The &lt;a href=\"Reformation%20in%20Denmark%E2%80%93Norway%20and%20Holstein\"&gt;Danish Reformation&lt;/a&gt; started in the mid-1520s. Some Danes wanted access to the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; in their own language. In 1524, Hans Mikkelsen and &lt;a href=\"Christiern%20Pedersen\"&gt;Christiern Pedersen&lt;/a&gt; translated the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;; it became an instant best-seller. Those who had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wittenberg\"&gt;Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and come under the influence of the teachings of Luther and his associates included &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Tausen\"&gt;Hans Tausen&lt;/a&gt;, a Danish monk in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Hospitaller\"&gt;Order of St John Hospitallers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 17th century Denmark-Norway colonized &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a failed war with the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Roskilde\"&gt;Treaty of Roskilde&lt;/a&gt; in 1658 removed the areas of the &lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20peninsula\"&gt;Scandinavian peninsula&lt;/a&gt; from Danish control, thus establishing the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; that exist to this day. In the centuries after this loss of territory, the populations of the &lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A5neland\"&gt;Scanian lands&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously been considered Danish, came to be fully integrated as &lt;a href=\"Swedes\"&gt;Swedes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 19th century, Denmark suffered a defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;; Denmark lost control over Norway and territories in what is now &lt;a href=\"northern%20Germany\"&gt;northern Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The political and economic defeat ironically sparked what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Danish Golden Age&lt;/a&gt; during which a Danish national identity first came to be fully formed. The Danish &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nationalism\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;European revolutions of 1848&lt;/a&gt; Denmark became a &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt; on 5 June 1849. The growing &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Frederick VII&lt;/a&gt; gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, &lt;a href=\"Separation%20of%20powers\"&gt;separating the powers&lt;/a&gt; and granting the &lt;a href=\"suffrage\"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the &lt;a href=\"executive%20branch\"&gt;executive branch&lt;/a&gt;.\nIdentity.\n (\"danskhed\") is the concept on which contemporary Danish national and ethnic identity is based. It is a set of values formed through the historic trajectory of the formation of the Danish nation. The ideology of Danishness emphasizes the notion of historical connection between the population and the territory of Denmark and the relation between the thousand-year-old Danish monarchy and the modern Danish state, the 19th-century national romantic idea of \"the people\" (\"folk\"), a view of Danish society as homogeneous and socially egalitarian as well as strong cultural ties to other Scandinavian nations.\nAs a concept, \"det danske folk\" (the Danish people) played an important role in 19th-century &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20nationalism\"&gt;ethnic nationalism&lt;/a&gt; and refers to self-identification rather than a legal status. Use of the term is most often restricted to a historical context; the historic German-Danish struggle regarding the status of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy\"&gt;Duchy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Schleswig\"&gt;Schleswig&lt;/a&gt; \"vis-\u00e0-vis\" a Danish &lt;a href=\"nation-state\"&gt;nation-state&lt;/a&gt;. It describes people of Danish &lt;a href=\"nationality\"&gt;nationality&lt;/a&gt;, both in Denmark and elsewhere\u2013most importantly, ethnic Danes in both Denmark proper and the former Danish &lt;a href=\"Duchy\"&gt;Duchy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Schleswig\"&gt;Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;. Excluded from this definition are people from the formerly Norway, &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;; members of the &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; minority; and members of other ethnic minorities.\nImportantly, since its formulation, Danish identity has not been linked to a particular racial or biological heritage, as many other ethno-national identities have. &lt;a href=\"N.%20F.%20S.%20Grundtvig\"&gt;N. F. S. Grundtvig&lt;/a&gt;, for example, emphasized the Danish language and the emotional relation to and identification with the nation of Denmark as the defining criteria of Danishness. This cultural definition of ethnicity has been suggested to be one of the reasons that Denmark was able to integrate their earliest ethnic minorities of Jewish and Polish origins into the Danish ethnic group. Jewishness was not seen as being incompatible with a Danish ethnic identity, as long as the most important cultural practices and values were shared. This inclusive ethnicity has in turn been described as the background for the relative lack of virulent &lt;a href=\"anti-semitism\"&gt;anti-semitism&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark and the &lt;a href=\"rescue%20of%20the%20Danish%20Jews\"&gt;rescue of the Danish Jews&lt;/a&gt;, saving ninety-nine percent of Denmark's Jewish population from the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern Danish cultural identity is rooted in the birth of the Danish national state during the 19th century. In this regard, Danish national identity was built on a basis of &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; culture and &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran theology&lt;/a&gt;, with Grundtvig and his popular movement playing a prominent part in the process. Two defining cultural criteria of being Danish were speaking the Danish language and identifying Denmark as a homeland.\nThe ideology of Danishness has been politically important in the formulation of Danish political relations with the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, which has been met with considerable resistance in the Danish population, and in recent reactions in the Danish public to the increasing influence of &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20to%20Denmark\"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiaspora.\nThe Danish &lt;a href=\"diaspora\"&gt;diaspora&lt;/a&gt; consists of emigrants and their descendants, especially those who maintain some of the customs of their Danish culture. A minority of approximately fifty thousand &lt;a href=\"Danish%20minority%20of%20Southern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Danish-identifying German citizens&lt;/a&gt; live in the former Danish territory of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Southern Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;, now located within the borders of Germany, forming around ten percent of the local population. In Denmark, the latter group is often referred to as \"Danes south of the border\" (), the \"Danish-minded\" (), or simply \"South Schleswigers\". Due to immigration there are considerable populations with Danish roots outside Denmark in countries such as the United States, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Danish%20Americans\"&gt;Danish Americans&lt;/a&gt; () are &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; of Danish descent. There are approximately 1,500,000 Americans of Danish origin or descent. Most Danish-Americans live in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20United%20States\"&gt;Western United States&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwestern United States&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has the largest population of people of Danish descent in the United States. Notable Danish communities in the United States are located in &lt;a href=\"Solvang%2C%20California\"&gt;Solvang, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Racine%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Racine, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, but these populations are not considered to be Danes for official purposes by the Danish state, and heritage alone can not be used to claim Danish citizenship, as it can in some European nations.\nAccording to the 2006 Census, there were 200,035 &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Canadians\"&gt;Canadians with Danish background&lt;/a&gt;, 17,650 of whom were born in Denmark. Canada became an important destination for the Danes during the post war period. At one point, a Canadian immigration office was to be set up in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Greenland, there were approximately 6,348 &lt;a href=\"Danes%20in%20Greenland\"&gt;Danish Greenlanders&lt;/a&gt; making up roughly 11% of the territory's population."
