They are currently members of the and play at Walton Road.\nHistory.\nPre-merger.\nThe original Molesey club was established by former &lt;a href=\"Corinthian%20F.C.\"&gt;Corinthian&lt;/a&gt; player James Jenkinson Knox in autumn 1892 under the name Hampton Court and East Molesey Association Football Club. Their first match was played on 24 September against &lt;a href=\"Barnes%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, with the new club winning 14\u20135. They were renamed the Molesey Football Club in 1896, but following Knox's death a series of clubs emerged, including Molesey Athletic and Molesey St Mary's, before Molesey St Paul's was formed in 1905. The club absorbed Molesey Football Club in 1911 and became Molesey &amp; St Paul's United, before being renamed Molesey Football Club. The club joined the Surrey Junior League in 1920 and won Section 3 in their first season, going on to win the championship playoffs with a 100 win over Godalming Federation. They also won the Surrey Junior Cup and the Surrey Junior Charity Cup.\nMolesey then moved up to Division One of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Suburban%20League\"&gt;Southern Suburban League&lt;/a&gt;. However, the cost of travelling led to the club resigning from the league after a single season, dropping into the Kingston &amp; District League. The remainder of the 1920s was a successful period for the club as they won the league and the Teck Cup four times, the Surrey Junior Charity Cup three times in a row between 1926\u201327 and 1928\u201329, the Chambers Cup twice and the League Cup once.
