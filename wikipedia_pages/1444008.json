    "text": "Georgi Chilikov (; born 23 August 1978 in &lt;a href=\"Burgas\"&gt;Burgas&lt;/a&gt;) is a former &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;er.\nHe was part of the Bulgarian &lt;a href=\"2004%20European%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;2004 European Football Championship&lt;/a&gt; team, which exited in the first round, finishing bottom of Group C, having finished top of Qualifying Group 8 in the pre-tournament phase. Chilikov scored his only goal for the national side in the 2:1 home win against &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; on 16 October 2002 in a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004%20qualifying\"&gt;Euro 2004 qualifier&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nChilikov was educated in &lt;a href=\"FC%20Chernomorets%20Burgas\"&gt;Chernomorets&lt;/a&gt;' youth academy. From 1999 to 2001 he played for the other club from &lt;a href=\"Burgas\"&gt;Burgas&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Naftex%20Burgas\"&gt;Naftex&lt;/a&gt;. His move from &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Naftex%20Burgas\"&gt;Naftex&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Levski%20Sofia\"&gt;PFC Levski (Sofia)&lt;/a&gt; made him the record holder of the highest transfer between Bulgarian clubs. In June 2001, &lt;a href=\"Levski%20Sofia\"&gt;PFC Levski (Sofia)&lt;/a&gt; signed Chilikov to a four-year deal for a record \u20ac1.25 million. During his time with the \"blues\", Chilikov established himself as a dependable goal-scorer. On 24 April 2004, he netted a &lt;a href=\"last-minute%20goal\"&gt;last-minute goal&lt;/a&gt; against archrivals &lt;a href=\"CSKA%20Sofia\"&gt;CSKA Sofia&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"A%20PFG\"&gt;A PFG&lt;/a&gt; match to help his team to a 2:1 away win. On 28 August 2002, Chilikov failed to convert a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; in the 0:1 loss against &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20Kyiv\"&gt;Dynamo Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; in a third qualifying round &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; match. In 2005, he moved to Portugal &lt;a href=\"CD%20Nacional\"&gt;Nacional Madeira&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2007, Chilikov was loaned out to &lt;a href=\"CSKA%20Sofia\"&gt;CSKA Sofia&lt;/a&gt; for one year and 50 000 euros price. Despite some reservations on the part of the CSKA supporters (due to the time he had spent at &lt;a href=\"Levski%20Sofia\"&gt;Levski Sofia&lt;/a&gt;), Chilikov quickly managed to win them over. On 11 August 2007, he netted an equalizing goal in an &lt;a href=\"A%20PFG\"&gt;A PFG&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Litex%20Lovech\"&gt;Litex Lovech&lt;/a&gt;.

However, despite generally impressing in his substitute appearances, Chilikov failed to establish himself as part of the starting 11.

After that he had brief stints with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tobol\"&gt;FC Tobol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PSFC%20Chernomorets%20Burgas\"&gt;Chernomorets Burgas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lokomotiv%20Plovdiv\"&gt;Lokomotiv Plovdiv&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoaching career.\nFrom July to September 2010 he served as assistant manager in &lt;a href=\"Neftochimic%20Burgas%201986\"&gt;Neftochimic Burgas&lt;/a&gt;.
