    "text": "Hwang Sun-hong (born 14 July 1968) is a South Korean former &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and current manager of &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea U-23&lt;/a&gt; national football team. He was the most notable South Korean striker in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nClub career.\nAfter graduating from Konkuk University, Hwang decided not to enter the K League draft and moved to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to begin his professional career. In the summer of 1991 he joined the &lt;a href=\"Bayer%20Leverkusen%20II\"&gt;reserve team&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bayer%20Leverkusen\"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;, and scored 10 goals with 10 appearances during the first half of the season in the &lt;a href=\"Oberliga%20Nordrhein\"&gt;Oberliga Nordrhein&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth division of Germany. He joined &lt;a href=\"2.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Wuppertaler%20SV\"&gt;Wuppertaler SV&lt;/a&gt; next year, but he appeared only nine games for a season because the &lt;a href=\"cruciate%20ligament\"&gt;cruciate ligament&lt;/a&gt; of his knee was ruptured.\nReturning to South Korea in June 1993, he was drafted by the newly formed club &lt;a href=\"Chonbuk%20Buffalo\"&gt;Wansan Puma&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the &lt;a href=\"Chonbuk%20Buffalo\"&gt;Chonbuk Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, and was traded to &lt;a href=\"Pohang%20Steelers\"&gt;Pohang Steelworks&lt;/a&gt; for eight players. In the &lt;a href=\"1995%20K%20League\"&gt;1995 K League&lt;/a&gt;, he spent his heyday by recording 11 goals and six assists with 24 appearances including a record, which he set by scoring in eight consecutive matches, but his team finished runners-up. He won two &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Club%20Championship\"&gt;Asian Club Championship&lt;/a&gt;s with Pohang, but he couldn't won a &lt;a href=\"K%20League\"&gt;K League&lt;/a&gt; title.\nHe also spent much of his career in the Japanese &lt;a href=\"J1%20League\"&gt;J1 League&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed his most prolific season with &lt;a href=\"Cerezo%20Osaka\"&gt;Cerezo Osaka&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 24 goals in 25 matches of the &lt;a href=\"1999%20J.League%20Division%201\"&gt;1999 J1 League&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first South Korean footballer who won the top scorer award of a foreign league. He was also nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Asian Footballer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in that year. In late 2003, having finally retired, Hwang has now turned his attention to coaching.\nInternational career.\nAs an unknown player who played for a university, Hwang was suddenly selected for the &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; squad for the &lt;a href=\"1988%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup\"&gt;1988 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; by the manager &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hoe-taik\"&gt;Lee Hoe-taik&lt;/a&gt;, who kept an eye on him since he became a high school player. He scored two goals, each of which were scored against &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iran%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, in the tournament. Following outstanding performances, which scored seven goals in &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt; campaign, he was included in the South Korea squad for the &lt;a href=\"1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1990 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, but his plays weren't in sync with colleagues' teamwork in the competition, and couldn't prevent three losses of team in the group stage.\nHe showed poor performance by scoring only one goal in &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28AFC%29\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, but his form was regained in the friendly matches just before the World Cup. However, he was injured the left knee in the last friendly against &lt;a href=\"Honduras%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; before the tournament, worrying his manager &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Ho\"&gt;Kim Ho&lt;/a&gt;. He had two chances to score in the first game against &lt;a href=\"Spain%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, but he missed both, and apologized to his teammates after the game. However, his poor performance was continued by missing several opportunities to score against &lt;a href=\"Bolivia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. South Korea met the defending champions &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in the last group match after two draws, and he pulled one back when Germany was taking a 3\u20130 lead, but the game finished 3\u20132. He was severely blamed for his inexact shots against Bolivia by South Korean fans, and suffered from &lt;a href=\"social%20anxiety%20disorder\"&gt;social anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt; after South Korea was eliminated in the group stage.\nIn contrast with fans' criticism, Hwang was consistently chosen as a striker of the national team by managers. At the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201994%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1994 Asian Games&lt;/a&gt;, he became the top scorer of the tournament by scoring 11 goals in five games including eight goals against &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. He also played for the &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;South Korea under-23&lt;/a&gt; squad as an overage player for the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, and contributed to a victory by winning a crucial penalty kick, finished as the winning goal, in the first game against &lt;a href=\"Ghana%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, but he quit the tournament due to his injury during the first half of the second game. He looked forward to the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; to make up for his failure in the 1994 World Cup, but he was injured by a Chinese goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Jiang%20Jin\"&gt;Jiang Jin&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly against &lt;a href=\"China%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; just before the World Cup, and was disappointed to be excluded from the line-up of the tournament. At the &lt;a href=\"2001%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2001 FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea was eliminated in the group stage, although they won two matches against &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, but he won the Bronze Shoe award by scoring two goals which led two victories.\nHwang was still an important part of South Korea even at the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, although he approached his mid-30s. By scoring the winning goal in the first group match against &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, he helped South Korea to achieve their first ever victory in the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He was injured the head during the second match against &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, but he continued to play after bandaging around his head. He won a penalty kick during the game, but his teammate missed it. He came forward as the first kicker of South Korea in the penalty shoot-out of the quarter-finals against Spain, and helped the team to reach the semi-finals by succeeding the shot. He ended his international career after the 2002 World Cup, and had made 103 appearances and 50 goals for South Korea alongside six operations, due to many injuries, during his career.\nManagerial career.\nIn 2005, Hwang was appointed as assistant coach of &lt;a href=\"Jeonnam%20Dragons\"&gt;Jeonnam Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and started his coaching career. He received Best Coach Award from the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Korean%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;2006 Korean FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. On 4 December 2007, he signed a three-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Busan%20IPark\"&gt;Busan IPark&lt;/a&gt; and became manager of Busan.\nOn 9 November 2010, he returned to his former team &lt;a href=\"Pohang%20Steelers\"&gt;Pohang Steelers&lt;/a&gt; as manager. In first coaching year at the Pohang, he guided the team to the second place in the regular season. A sound knowledge of coaching, player training, and club training analysis and observation - as a coach, the Pohang Steelers became the FA Cup champions in 2012. The success of the organization under the careful, meticulous, and successful guidance of Hwang continued as the Pohang defended their FA Cup title for another year in 2013 and became &lt;a href=\"K%20League%201\"&gt;K League 1&lt;/a&gt; champions in that year. He received the &lt;a href=\"K%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;K League Manager of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 21 June 2016, he was appointed as manager of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Seoul\"&gt;FC Seoul&lt;/a&gt;. On 30 April 2018, he resigned as Seoul manager with responsibility for poor performance. On 14 December 2018, Hwang was appointed as manager of &lt;a href=\"Yanbian%20Funde%20F.C.\"&gt;Yanbian Funde&lt;/a&gt;. However, he left the club after Yanbian Funde was disqualified for the &lt;a href=\"2019%20China%20League%20One\"&gt;2019 China League One&lt;/a&gt; due to owing taxes in February 2019.\nCareer statistics.\nInternational.\nSource:\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nPohang Steelers\nSouth Korea\nIndividual\nManager.\nBusan IPark\nPohang Steelers\nFC Seoul\nIndividual"
