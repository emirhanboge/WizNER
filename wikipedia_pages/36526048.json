    "text": "A stopping house was a kind of &lt;a href=\"rural\"&gt;rural&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lodging\"&gt;lodging&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Northwest\"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt; during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by &lt;a href=\"fur%20traders\"&gt;fur traders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"American%20pioneer\"&gt;pioneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nA stopping house was essentially a private residence that also offered room and board, and were located on early pioneer trails. They were similar to the &lt;a href=\"coaching%20inn\"&gt;coaching inn&lt;/a&gt;s of Britain and Ireland except that they were not located on well-traveled routes, but on frontier tracks. Eventually, however, scheduled &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; services were started in the West.\nStopping houses often became the nucleus of newly formed communities. They generally disappeared after the railway or highway reached an area, and were replaced with &lt;a href=\"Hotel%23Railway%20hotels\"&gt;railway hotels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"motor%20hotel\"&gt;motor hotel&lt;/a&gt;s in the 20th century.\nSome examples of stopping houses include &lt;a href=\"Froggie%27s%20Stopping%20Place%20on%20the%20Whoop-Up%20Trail\"&gt;Froggie's Stopping Place on the Whoop-Up Trail&lt;/a&gt;, a National Historic Site in &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Telford\"&gt;Robert Telford&lt;/a&gt;'s House, on the &lt;a href=\"Calgary-Edmonton%20Trail\"&gt;Calgary-Edmonton Trail&lt;/a&gt;, near present-day &lt;a href=\"Leduc%2C%20Alberta\"&gt;Leduc, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;."
