During the World Cup, the arena had a capacity of 41,390, and currently can seat 44,003 spectators.\nPrior to its use for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the venue received much criticism. It suffered a fire in October 2013, due to &lt;a href=\"polystyrene\"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt; insulation panels catching alight. Although nobody was injured, the fire came within 24 hours of the state governor of &lt;a href=\"Mato%20Grosso\"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt; warning that it may not be finished for the World Cup. On the day of its opening, on 24 April 2014, 5,000 seats were still to be installed in the stadium. Next to the football stadium is the &lt;a href=\"Gin%C3%A1sio%20Aecim%20Tocantins\"&gt;Gin\u00e1sio Aecim Tocantins&lt;/a&gt;.\n2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\nArena Pantanal was one of the five venues to host matches of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt;."
