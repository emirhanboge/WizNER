    "title": "Outdoor water-use restriction",
    "text": "An outdoor water-use restriction is a &lt;a href=\"Ban%20%28law%29\"&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; or other lesser &lt;a href=\"Regulation\"&gt;restrictions&lt;/a&gt; put into effect that restricts the outdoor use of &lt;a href=\"Water%20supply\"&gt;water supplies&lt;/a&gt;. Often called a watering ban or hosepipe ban, it can affect:\nSuch bans may be put in place by &lt;a href=\"local%20government\"&gt;local government&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"state%20government\"&gt;state government&lt;/a&gt; or water supplier. In the latter case, local authorities often still can enact more restrictive measures.\nSuch a ban is usually enacted during &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;s, to preserve water for essential uses such as &lt;a href=\"drinking\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flush%20toilet\"&gt;flushing toilets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as for &lt;a href=\"firefighting\"&gt;firefighting&lt;/a&gt;. If there is a &lt;a href=\"water%20main\"&gt;water main&lt;/a&gt; break, or a problem with a &lt;a href=\"water%20tower\"&gt;water tower&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Reservoir%20%28water%29\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, a ban may be enacted on a very local and temporary basis. Bans that control water and plant uses can be permanent. &lt;a href=\"Greywater\"&gt;Greywater&lt;/a&gt; recycling is becoming a necessity due to shortages in freshwater supply, an increase in populations with its associated food supply, and economic development.\nRestrictions.\nTypical restrictions include:\nThe use of &lt;a href=\"drip%20irrigation\"&gt;drip irrigation&lt;/a&gt; systems may or may not be exempt from the restrictions, or be less restricted than normal &lt;a href=\"irrigation%20sprinkler\"&gt;water sprinklers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusinesses that use water as a critical part of their operations are usually not exempt. This includes &lt;a href=\"carwash\"&gt;car washes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plant%20nurseries\"&gt;plant nurseries&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"landscaping\"&gt;landscaping&lt;/a&gt; companies. A typical restriction on a car wash would be to &lt;a href=\"recycle\"&gt;recycle&lt;/a&gt; the water.\nAbuse of restrictions usually brings a warning at first, then a &lt;a href=\"Fine%20%28penalty%29\"&gt;fine&lt;/a&gt;, and can lead to limiting or cutting off the water to the home or &lt;a href=\"business\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Enforcement\"&gt;Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; is generally by the local water authority or even from &lt;a href=\"police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-potable water usage.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"xeriscaping\"&gt;xeriscaping&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; locations, avoids having to water in the first place. Using greywater or stored &lt;a href=\"runoff%20%28water%29\"&gt;runoff&lt;/a&gt; from a roof &lt;a href=\"Rain%20gutter\"&gt;gutter&lt;/a&gt; downspout is also an alternative for trees and &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;s, but not for large expanses of &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, which would be difficult to cover. Australian researchers have concluded that there is little evidence for spreading of disease through greywater used in landscaping and that greywater should be applied below the soil surface and not directly on top.\nCountries.\nAustralia.\nWater restrictions are in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from drought. Depending upon the location, these can include restrictions on watering lawns, using sprinkler systems, washing vehicles, hosing in paved areas and refilling swimming pools, among others. Water restrictions in Australia are enforced by fines and for repeat offenders by reducing water supply.\nUnited Kingdom.\nA \"hosepipe ban\" is a &lt;a href=\"British%20English\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; term for a water restriction placed on the customers of a &lt;a href=\"water%20industry\"&gt;water company&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from using &lt;a href=\"garden%20hose\"&gt;garden hose&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly for watering their &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;s. The provider sometimes states that their customers are not allowed to use a &lt;a href=\"irrigation%20sprinkler\"&gt;sprinkler&lt;/a&gt; or unattended hosepipe for a few days (or longer), but commonly, a total ban is enacted. Bans are usually in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and South &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, rarely in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; because of the damper climate. Commercial customers are usually exempt to prevent loss of earnings or other such problems.\nThe water industry usually places such restrictions on their customers during &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;s or when the &lt;a href=\"reservoir%20%28water%29\"&gt;reservoirs&lt;/a&gt; supplying the water are becoming empty.\nPreviously, contravening a temporary water restriction is a &lt;a href=\"criminal%20offence\"&gt;criminal offence&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Industry%20Act%201991\"&gt;Water Industry Act 1991&lt;/a&gt; (though the first prosecution for \"wasteful use of water\" was in 1921 and resulted in a fine of 20 shillings). Although offenders are usually warned, they are liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding \u00a31,000 under the terms of the Act. Currently the law on hosepipe bans is contained in section 36 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which replaced the previous law which was contained in section 76 of the Water Industry Act 1991. Previously, under the Water Industry Act 1991, hosepipe bans could only prohibit the watering of private gardens and/or the washing of private motor cars. The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 has extended considerably the sort of activities that can be prohibited."
