    "text": "The Kenya Fluorspar Company (KFC), also known simply as Kenya Fluorspar, is a privately held &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; company in &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in &lt;a href=\"Kimwarer\"&gt;Kimwarer&lt;/a&gt;, a village in the southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Kerio%20Valley\"&gt;Kerio Valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elgeyo-Marakwet%20County\"&gt;Elgeyo-Marakwet County&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1967, &lt;a href=\"fluorspar\"&gt;fluorspar&lt;/a&gt; deposits were first discovered in the Kerio Valley, and the Kenyan government established the Fluorspar Company of Kenya (FCK) to exploit them on a large scale. The company went into &lt;a href=\"receivership\"&gt;receivership&lt;/a&gt; in 1979, as Kenya Fluorspar, another government-owned company, bought the assets and took over operations. In 1996, Canadian businessman &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Field-Marsham\"&gt;Charles Field-Marsham&lt;/a&gt; acquired KFC as part of a government reform effort of corporate &lt;a href=\"privatization\"&gt;privatization&lt;/a&gt;, entering into a 20-year lease with the government for 3,664 hectares of land.\nKFC halted its mining operations in February 2009 due to an &lt;a href=\"Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010\"&gt;economic downturn&lt;/a&gt;, laying off 190 workers, but it resumed operations in June 2010. Operations were scaled down in June 2015, with the company laying off 75 workers and attempting to sell its existing fluorspar stock.\nIn February 2016, the company announced that it would halt operations again, citing weak global fluorspar demands. By June, the company had halted its operations and laid off over 2,000 workers. The company's land lease expired in March 2018 and was not renewed. In April 2018, control of the company's mine and various assets reverted to the Kenyan government.\nIn January 2018, it was announced that the Kenyan government set up a task force to see out the compensation of over 4,000 land owners who were displaced to make way for the company's mining activities in the 1970s. However, disputes among locals over the mode of compensation, with some seeking alternative land and others demanding money, as well as disagreements between locals and state officials over the amount owed, have delayed the process.\nOperations.\nKenya Fluorspar's mining operations take place on land leased to the company by the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Kenya\"&gt;Government of Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. The land was acquired in 1986 through a compulsory purchase order and compensation paid by the government. Much of its product is exported to &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, production was valued at $14 million.\nIn March 2012, the company completed a de-bottlenecking of its processing plant to increase its total capacity to 130,000 tonnes, up from 121,000 tonnes in 2011.\nThe company has asserted that it had taken various steps to address environmental concerns, such as through dust and spillage reduction, water purification and recycling, and tree planting. The company complies with &lt;a href=\"National%20Environment%20Management%20Authority%20of%20Kenya\"&gt;NEMA&lt;/a&gt; requirements and holds a certificate of environmental compliance.\nCommunity work and sponsorship.\nIt is a leading employer in the area with 400 workers and its corporate social responsibilities program provides health, education and other facilities to its e yees and the local community.\nThe company sponsors an annual 10 Kilometres &lt;a href=\"road%20running\"&gt;road running&lt;/a&gt; competition in Kerio Valley and the Fluorspar FC playing in &lt;a href=\"Nationwide%20League%20%28Kenya%29\"&gt;Nationwide League&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorporate social responsibility.\nIn 2008, the company sponsored an annual 10\u00a0km &lt;a href=\"road%20running\"&gt;road running&lt;/a&gt; competition in Kerio Valley and the football team Fluorspar F.C., which competed in the &lt;a href=\"Kenyan%20Nationwide%20League\"&gt;Nationwide League&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2012, the company launched a &lt;a href=\"taekwondo\"&gt;taekwondo&lt;/a&gt; gym known as the Kenya Fluorspar Centre in Kerio Valley."
