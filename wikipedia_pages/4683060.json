    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Aztec slavery&lt;/a&gt;, within the structure of the &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; society, produced many &lt;a href=\"slaves\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, known by the &lt;a href=\"Nahuatl\"&gt;Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; word, \"tlacotin.\" Within Mexica society, slaves constituted an important class.\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; was not a station one was born into, but a state entered into as a form of punishment, out of financial desperation, or as a captive. The practice consisted of two systems:\nAztecs as slave owners.\nSlave owners were required to provide food, water, and shelter for their slaves.\nWomen slave owners exerted much\nin the way of choice, in regard to slaves. For example, if a woman was widowed, it was not uncommon for her to either remarry one of her husband's slaves, or make one of his slaves her personal steward. The richest merchants in Mexica society were slave traders. Not only were they wealthy, but they were also granted special privileges. They were also considered to be very religious, and played a key role in the festival of &lt;a href=\"Panquetzaliztli\"&gt;Panquetzaliztli&lt;/a&gt; festival, in honor of Mexica god, &lt;a href=\"Huitzilopochtli\"&gt;Huitzilopochtli&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny person not related to a slave's master could be enslaved for trying to \"prevent\" a slave's escape. If one slave would not behave in accordance to the slave masters will, he could be sentenced to death.\nSlaves in the Aztec society.\nWhile slavery could not be inherited, in Mexica society, one could, in fact, live indefinitely as a slave. For example, &lt;a href=\"Moctezuma%20II\"&gt;Moctezuma II&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to confiscating property, would condemn traitors, or their families, to slavery for life. He would also do the same to astrologers who failed to predict the occurrence of omens.\nSlaves were bound to their master's lands, until one's debt was paid to his master. Barring being a captive, being punished for committing a crime, or failing to pay an outstanding gambling debt, slavery was an institution one could enter into freely. In that respect, the system was not slavery, but contractual indentured servitude, resulting in \"unfree\" labor. However, it was such a widely held practice that the Mexica would often sell their children into slavery.\nSlaves wore maguey garments called \"\"&lt;a href=\"Aztec%20clothing\"&gt;cueitl&lt;/a&gt;,\"\" which was a skirt that wrapped around the hips, one end overlapping the other, held together by a belt-like strap. Reflecting their low status in society, the \"cueitl\" of slaves were colorless. Typically, upon the death of their owner, slaves who had performed outstanding services were freed, while the rest were passed on as part of the inheritance. As for assigned work, many slaves were sent to the regions of Cimatan and the &lt;a href=\"Acalan\"&gt;Acalan&lt;/a&gt;, aquatic environments, to work as rowers and as laborers in the cacao groves, which was work that needed to be done year-round.\nBeyond their labor, slaves were free; they could marry and own their own property including other slaves. They were also expected to contribute to the betterment of Mexica society. For example, slaves helped move the military's equipment when it set off for battle. When slaves had children, the children were not passed down to the master of the slaves but were set free to live their own lives.\nUse of slaves by various social classes.\nSlaves could be used for any sort of work, however in practice most slaves often found themselves as servants in the palaces of lords. When noblemen died they were &lt;a href=\"Cremation\"&gt;cremated&lt;/a&gt; with forty slaves, 20 women and 20 men.\nAztec society consisted of strict social class structure and every individual had their place in society, yet your social class was not set in stone there was room for maneuvering. Aztec slaves were a vehicle for moving around the societal hierarchy. Jos\u00e9 Luis de Rojas the author of \"Tenochtitlan: Capital of the Aztec Empire\" states that one of the most respected positions an Aztec commoner could obtain was the role of \u201cTealtiani\"\" or the person responsible for the cleansing of slaves before &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20sacrifice\"&gt;sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlavery of war captives.\nSlavery was most difficult for &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20warfare\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; captives who, after being captured, could be sold. They could also be &lt;a href=\"human%20sacrifice\"&gt;sacrificed&lt;/a&gt; at a religious ceremony or festival. For example, slaves were selected to be \"ixiptla\", which is a representation of a &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20mythology\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;. They believed that the god would, in turn, represent a force of celestial natures such as the wind or the moon, and that sacrificing the slave would satisfy the god, who would then bring good fortune to the people. In the event of a nobleman's death, slaves could be killed, and buried with him, to assist him in the &lt;a href=\"Mictlan\"&gt;underworld&lt;/a&gt;, as they assisted him in life. The body parts of sacrificed slaves could be taken home and eaten with maize and salt as an extension of their sacrifice.\nIt was a great honor to be given the opportunity to sacrifice a human in a public setting in the Aztec Empire. The warriors would go out into combat and come back with slaves to sacrifice but for the elderly and nobles this was not an option, and in turn they would purchase slaves. The book \"&lt;a href=\"Tenochtitlan\"&gt;Tenochtitlan&lt;/a&gt;: Capital of the Aztec Empire\" by Jos\u00e9 Luis de Rojas also mentions that citizens would buy slaves that held similar occupations as themselves for sacrifice.\nEmancipation.\nA way for slaves to get their freedom was by running outside the walls, at the marketplace and stepping on a piece of human &lt;a href=\"excrement\"&gt;excrement&lt;/a&gt;, then presenting their case to the judges, asking for freedom. If granted, the slaves would then be washed, given new clothes (not owned by the master), and declared free.\nAztec slave trade.\nSlaves were also frequent faces in the market of &lt;a href=\"Tenochtitlan\"&gt;Tenochtitlan&lt;/a&gt; where they could be sold along with food, cloth, and handmade goods. However, the cities with the most well-known slave markets were &lt;a href=\"Azcapotzalco\"&gt;Azcapotzalco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iz%C3%BAcar%20de%20Matamoros\"&gt;Itzocan&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsually, only wealthy men, or nobles, could often afford slaves. Slaves could be bought for 30 cotton garments called \"quachtli.\" Slaves who could entertain their masters with a talent, such as by singing or dancing, were more expensive, and could cost upwards of 25 percent more.\nSlaves that possessed different skills were valued at different prices. According to Jos\u00e9 Luis de Rojas the author of \"Tenochtitlan: Capital of the Aztec Empire\", slaves that could dance would be worth around 40 cotton cloth while different skills like weaving were valued differently. Luis also writes about how Slaves could also be purchased with &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20chocolate\"&gt;Cacao beans&lt;/a&gt;, the average slave was possessed at 3000-4000 beans.\nCollared slaves.\nOrozco y Berra reports that a master could not sell a slave without the slave's consent, unless the slave had been classified as &lt;a href=\"incorrigible\"&gt;incorrigible&lt;/a&gt; by an authority. Incorrigibility could be determined on the basis of repeated laziness, attempts to run away, or general bad conduct. Incorrigible slaves were made to wear a wooden collar, affixed by rings at the back. The collar was not merely a symbol of bad conduct: it was designed to make it harder to run away through a crowd or through narrow spaces.\nAccording to Dr. Michael Smith slaves for sale in the market all were identified by their large wooden collars.\nWhen buying a collared slave, one was informed of how many times that slave had been sold. A slave who was sold three times as incorrigible could be sold to be &lt;a href=\"Human%20sacrifice%20in%20Aztec%20culture\"&gt;sacrificed&lt;/a&gt;; those slaves commanded a premium in price. However, if a collared slave managed to present him- or herself in the royal palace or in a temple, he or she would regain liberty.\nVoluntary slavery.\nSome slaves gave up their freedom to pay off gambling debts. However, becoming a slave was a process. First, the gambler had to stand before four respected elders. They would then conduct a ceremony whereby the gambler would prefers his want (or need) to become a slave and be given, by his new owner, the price of his freedom, which was often 20 pieces of cloth and the means to live alone for a year before he began his slavery. After the gambler spent that amount, his service would be exchanged for food, shelter and clothing. Anyone could be a slave, though commoners were more likely to enter slavery voluntarily. But, because slaves were looked down upon, it was usually the last option one took to pay off a debt. Beside gamblers, selling oneself into slavery was often a fate for aging &lt;a href=\"courtesan\"&gt;courtesan&lt;/a&gt;s or prostitutes, known among the Mexica as \"ahuini\". Beyond paying off debts people may have become slaves to better support themselves in times of economic crisis. During a Famine in the 1450s many Aztecs sold themselves into slavery in the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt; where economic prospects were better.\nSuperstitions and slavery.\nIt was believed that those who were born in the 13-day series that started with &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20calendar\"&gt;1 Ocelotl&lt;/a&gt; were destined to be slaves, or that their lives would be burdened with something else undesirable."
