    "text": "Ignatius Loyola Donnelly (November 3, 1831 \u2013 January 1, 1901) was an American &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Congressman\"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"populism\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt; writer, and &lt;a href=\"fringe%20science\"&gt;fringe scientist&lt;/a&gt;. He is known primarily now for his &lt;a href=\"fringe%20theories\"&gt;fringe theories&lt;/a&gt; concerning &lt;a href=\"Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catastrophism\"&gt;Catastrophism&lt;/a&gt; (especially the idea of an ancient &lt;a href=\"impact%20event\"&gt;impact event&lt;/a&gt; affecting ancient civilizations), and &lt;a href=\"Shakespearean%20authorship\"&gt;Shakespearean authorship&lt;/a&gt;, which many modern historians consider to be &lt;a href=\"pseudoscience\"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pseudohistory\"&gt;pseudohistory&lt;/a&gt;. Donnelly's work corresponds to the writings of late-19th and early-20th century figures such as &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Blavatsky\"&gt;Helena Blavatsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Steiner\"&gt;Rudolf Steiner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"James%20Churchward\"&gt;James Churchward&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nDonnelly was the son of Philip Carrol Donnelly, an Irish Catholic immigrant who had settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His sister was the writer &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20C.%20Donnelly\"&gt;Eleanor C. Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;. On June 29, 1826, Philip had married Catherine Gavin, a second-generation American of Irish ancestry.\nAfter starting as a peddler, Philip studied medicine at the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20College%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;Philadelphia College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. He later contracted &lt;a href=\"typhus\"&gt;typhus&lt;/a&gt; from a patient and died at age 31, leaving his wife with five children.\nCatherine provided for her children by operating a pawn shop. Ignatius, her youngest son, was admitted to the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Central%20High%20School%20%28Philadelphia%29\"&gt;Central High School&lt;/a&gt;, the second oldest public high school in the United States. There he studied under the presidency of John S. Hart, excelling primarily in literature.\nDonnelly decided to become a lawyer and became a clerk for &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20H.%20Brewster\"&gt;Benjamin Brewster&lt;/a&gt;, who later became &lt;a href=\"Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Attorney General of the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Donnelly was admitted to the bar in 1852. In 1855, he married Katherine McCaffrey, with whom he had three children. In 1855, he resigned his clerkship, entered politics, and participated in communal home building schemes. He quit the Catholic Church sometime in the 1850s and thereafter was never active in any religious group.\nDonnelly moved to the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Territory in 1857 amidst rumors of a financial scandal, and there he settled in &lt;a href=\"Dakota%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Dakota County&lt;/a&gt;. He initiated a &lt;a href=\"utopian\"&gt;utopian&lt;/a&gt; community called &lt;a href=\"Nininger%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Nininger City&lt;/a&gt;, together with several partners. However, the &lt;a href=\"Panic%20of%201857\"&gt;Panic of 1857&lt;/a&gt; doomed the attempt at a &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20farming\"&gt;cooperative farm&lt;/a&gt; and community and left Donnelly deeply in debt.\nHis wife Katherine died in 1894. In 1898, he married his secretary, Marian Hanson.\nDonnelly died on January 1, 1901, in &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, Minnesota, age 69 years. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. His personal papers are archived at the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Historical%20Society\"&gt;Minnesota Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical and literary career.\nDonnelly entered politics and was lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 1860 to 1863. He was a &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Republican\"&gt;Radical Republican&lt;/a&gt; Congressman from Minnesota in the &lt;a href=\"38th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;38th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"39th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;39th&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"40th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;40th congresses&lt;/a&gt;, (1863\u20131869), a state senator from 1874\u20131878 and 1891\u20131894 and a state representative from 1887\u20131888 and 1897\u20131898. As a &lt;a href=\"legislator\"&gt;legislator&lt;/a&gt;, he advocated extending the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Freedmen%27s%20Bureau\"&gt;Freedmen's Bureau&lt;/a&gt; to provide education for freedmen so that they could protect themselves once the bureau was withdrawn. Donnelly was also an early supporter of &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20suffrage\"&gt;women's suffrage&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving the Minnesota State Senate in 1878, he returned to his law practice and writing.\nIn 1877, Donnelly spoke at a meeting of 10,000 people where he read his preamble to the conference platform. The document of 12 short paragraphs, as altered slightly for the party's first nominating convention in Omaha that July, was the pithiest and soon became the most widely-circulated statement of the Populist credo. Donnelly talked about the corruption of politics and voting, newspapers giving out false and biased material, and how the Populists needed to take back the country that was their own.\nIn 1882, he published \"\", his best-known work. It details theories concerning the mythical &lt;a href=\"lost%20continent\"&gt;lost continent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;. The book sold well and is widely credited with initiating the theme of Atlantis as an &lt;a href=\"antediluvian\"&gt;antediluvian&lt;/a&gt; civilization that became such a feature of popular literature during the 20th century and contributed to the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Mayanism\"&gt;Mayanism&lt;/a&gt;. Donnelly suggested that Atlantis, whose story was told by &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt; in the dialogues of &lt;a href=\"Timaeus%20%28dialogue%29\"&gt;Timaeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Critias\"&gt;Critias&lt;/a&gt;, had been destroyed during the same event remembered in the Bible as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Flood\"&gt;Great Flood&lt;/a&gt;. He cited research on the ancient &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya civilization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20%C3%89tienne%20Brasseur%20de%20Bourbourg\"&gt;Charles \u00c9tienne Brasseur de Bourbourg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Le%20Plongeon\"&gt;Augustus Le Plongeon&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had been the place of a common origin of ancient civilizations in Africa, especially &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;), Europe, and the Americas. He also thought that it had been the original home of an &lt;a href=\"Aryan\"&gt;Aryan&lt;/a&gt; race whose red-haired, blue-eyed descendants could be found in Ireland. It is believed that &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was the \"Garden of Phoebus\" (Hyperborea) of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Myth\"&gt;mythologists&lt;/a&gt;.\nA year after \"Atlantis\", he published \"\", in which he expounded his belief that the Flood, as well as the destruction of Atlantis and the extinction of the mammoth, had been brought about by the near-collision of the earth with a massive comet. This book also sold well, and both books seem to have had an important influence on the development of &lt;a href=\"Immanuel%20Velikovsky\"&gt;Immanuel Velikovsky&lt;/a&gt;'s controversial ideas half a century later.\nIn 1888, he published \"The Great Cryptogram\" in which he proposed that &lt;a href=\"Shakespeare\"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s plays had been &lt;a href=\"Baconian%20theory\"&gt;written by Francis Bacon&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that was popular during the late 19th and early 20th century. He then traveled to England to arrange the English publication of his book by &lt;a href=\"Sampson%20Low\"&gt;Sampson Low&lt;/a&gt;, speaking at the Oxford (and Cambridge) Union in which his thesis \"Resolved, that the works of William Shakespeare were composed by Francis Bacon\" was put to an unsuccessful vote. The book was a complete failure, and Donnelly was discredited.\nDonnelly also made several other campaigns for public office during the 1880s. He made a losing campaign for Congress, this time as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, in 1884. In 1887, he successfully campaigned for a seat in the Minnesota State Legislature as an independent. During this period, he was also an organizer of the &lt;a href=\"Farmers%27%20Alliance\"&gt;Minnesota Farmers' Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1892, Donnelly wrote the preamble of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28US%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Omaha%20Platform\"&gt;Omaha Platform&lt;/a&gt; for the presidential campaign of that year. He was nominated for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Vice President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1900 by the People's Party, also known as the Populist Party. The People's Party was a development of the National Farmers' Alliance, and had a platform that demanded the abandonment of the &lt;a href=\"gold%20standard\"&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt; and later for the adoption of &lt;a href=\"free%20silver\"&gt;free silver&lt;/a&gt;), the abolition of &lt;a href=\"national%20bank\"&gt;national bank&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"graduated%20income%20tax\"&gt;graduated income tax&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;direct election of senators&lt;/a&gt;, civil service reform, and an &lt;a href=\"eight-hour%20day\"&gt;eight-hour day&lt;/a&gt;. That year, Donnelly also campaigned for governor of Minnesota but was defeated.\nThe People's Party protested the railroad companies corrupting government and advocated government regulation of the railroads. Donnelly had a key leadership role in this party, yet he received $10,000 from the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company.\nState park.\nDuring the 1930s, an organization was formed to lobby for the creation of a state park at Donnelly's home at &lt;a href=\"Nininger%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Nininger&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Hastings%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Hastings&lt;/a&gt;, Minnesota. The house was still standing in 1939, but the effort failed and the house has since been demolished.\nReception.\nDonnelly's writings on Atlantis have been rejected by scholars and scientists. He has been described as a &lt;a href=\"Crank%20%28person%29\"&gt;crank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pseudoscience\"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt; promoter.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Stein\"&gt;Gordon Stein&lt;/a&gt; has noted that \"most of what Donnelly said was highly questionable or downright wrong.\"\nWorks.\nHis books include:"
