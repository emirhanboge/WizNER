In 1921, he founded Bigelow State Bank, which later became Eastern Exchange Bank.\nEarly years.\nBigelow was born in &lt;a href=\"Corunna%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Corunna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shiawassee%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Shiawassee County, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in 1878. His parents, Rolla P. Bigelow and Charlotte (Pratt) Bigelow, were both Michigan natives. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"1880%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;1880 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, Bigelow's father was employed as a store clerk in Corunna. He was later employed as a \"commercial traveler.\" The family moved to &lt;a href=\"Owosso%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Owosso, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, where Bigelow was raised.\nBigelow initially attended &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Agricultural%20College\"&gt;Michigan Agricultural College&lt;/a&gt; (M.A.C.), later known as &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the M.A.C. football team in 1898.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nBigelow transferred to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; where he played college football for &lt;a href=\"Fielding%20H.%20Yost\"&gt;Fielding H.

He graduated from Michigan with an engineering degree in 1905.\nBanking career.\nAfter graduating from Michigan, Bigelow became a banker in New York. As of 1911, he was employed as a banker at 49 Wall Street in New York. By 1918, he had formed Bigelow &amp; Co., an investment banking house with offices at 25 Pine Street in New York.\nIn January 1921, he formed Bigelow State Bank, a New York state chartered bank based in Manhattan, and served as its president. At the time of its opening, \"The New York Times\" reported that it \"offers banking facilities to individuals who wish to deposit small amounts. 'The bank for the individual' is the motto of the new institution.\"\nIn December 1924, Bigelow changed the name of his bank to the Eastern Exchange Bank and continued to serve as its president. In November 1926, &lt;a href=\"Harriman%20Brothers%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;W. A. Harriman &amp; Co., Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, purchased \"a substantial interest\" in the bank, with Bigelow remaining as the president. At the time of the Harriman investment, \"The New York Times\" described the business of Bigelow's bank as follows: \"This bank is said to be the only institution in New York City confining its activities entirely to individual deposit accounts, and makes a point of extending banking facilities to small accounts. It does no commercial business and discounts no commercial paper, confining its loans only to marketable collateral.\" In May 1928, the Eastern Exchange Bank moved its headquarters from 10 Broadway to the Harriman Building at 37 Broadway.\nFamily and later years.\nBigelow was married to Doris Bissell in 1916. They had a daughter, Betsy Bigelow, and a son, Robert Pratt Bigelow. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"1930%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;1930 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, Bigelow was living in &lt;a href=\"Woodsburgh%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Woodsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nassau%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Nassau County, New York&lt;/a&gt; with his wife Doris, their two children Doris E. Bigelow (age 8) and Robert P. Bigelow (age 3), and three servants. Bigelow's occupation was listed as a bank president.\nAfter retiring, Bigelow moved to &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Haven%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Winter Haven&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1952, he died at an &lt;a href=\"Orlando%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; hospital at age 74 after a brief illness. He left an estate valued at $517,713."
