    "title": "Poultry allergy",
    "text": "Poultry meat allergy is a rare &lt;a href=\"food%20allergy\"&gt;food allergy&lt;/a&gt; in humans caused by consumption of poultry meat (commonly &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"turkey%20as%20food\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;) whereby the body triggers an immune reaction and becomes overloaded with &lt;a href=\"immunoglobulin%20E\"&gt;immunoglobulin E&lt;/a&gt; (IgE) antibodies.\nIt can co-occur with &lt;a href=\"egg%20allergy\"&gt;egg allergy&lt;/a&gt; but more often occurs without allergy to poultry eggs. One study found that not chicken, just turkey meat are the primary cause of allergic reactions, whilst goose, pheasant, and duck meat cause milder reaction or no symptoms.\nEpidemiology.\nAs it is a rare condition and it is not well documented; epidemiological data is unknown. Severe cases have been documented. A research study in 2016 found only 16 cases of previously published poultry meat allergy, plus an additional 28 cases that were being analyzed in the study.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms are similar to other forms of allergies and occur after ingestion of the allergen. Some symptoms include abdominal cramping, &lt;a href=\"angioedema\"&gt;angioedema&lt;/a&gt;, generalized &lt;a href=\"urticaria\"&gt;urticaria&lt;/a&gt;, and chest tightness. "
