    "text": "Luciano Chiarugi (; born 13 January 1947) is an Italian &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager and former player who played as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ponsacco\"&gt;Ponsacco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Pisa\"&gt;Province of Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, Chiarugi started his career with &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;, being part of the lineup that won the &lt;a href=\"1968%E2%80%9369%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1968\u201369 Serie A&lt;/a&gt; title. After seven seasons with the \"viola\", Chiarugi moved to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt; in 1972, being instrumental to the \"rossoneri\" triumph in the &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;1972\u201373 European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, won thanks to a goal by him in the &lt;a href=\"1973%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;, finishing the competition as top scorer.\nIn 1976, he was sold to &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt; in an exchange bid with &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Braglia\"&gt;Giorgio Braglia&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he shared the same nickname: \"Cavallo Pazzo\" (\"Crazy\" or \"Mad Horse\", in Italian). He played two seasons with the \"azzurri\", winning a &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Italian%20Cup\"&gt;Anglo-Italian Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He played for &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"U.C.%20Sampdoria\"&gt;Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt; in 1978\u201379, and then back to Serie A with &lt;a href=\"Bologna%20F.C.%201909\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; the following season. After spells with minor league teams &lt;a href=\"Rimini%20Calcio%20F.C.\"&gt;Rimini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rondinella%20Calcio\"&gt;Rondinella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Massese%201919\"&gt;Massese&lt;/a&gt;, Chiarugi retired from football in 1986.\nInternational career.\nChiarugi also gained three caps for the &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy national football team&lt;/a&gt;, making his debut on 22 November 1969 in a 3\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nStyle of play.\nKnown in Italian football for his impetuous nature, pace and technique, which gained him the nickname \"Cavallo Pazzo\" (Crazy Horse), Chiarugi was a quick, energetic, and highly creative &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; with an eye for goal and excellent &lt;a href=\"Dribbling%23Association%20football\"&gt;dribbling&lt;/a&gt; skills, known for his individualistic playing style, as well as his use of elaborate &lt;a href=\"Dummy%20%28football%29\"&gt;feints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nutmeg%20%28football%29\"&gt;nutmegs&lt;/a&gt; to beat opponents. He was also known for his accurate striking and &lt;a href=\"Cross%20%28football%29\"&gt;crossing&lt;/a&gt; ability, and was effective from set-pieces; this allowed him to play both as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;, or as a &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Winger\"&gt;winger&lt;/a&gt; on either flank. However, despite his talent, he was also popularly considered as a &lt;a href=\"Diving%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;diver&lt;/a&gt;, causing the Italian media to create the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"neologism\"&gt;neologism&lt;/a&gt; \"chiarugismo\", a synonym of \"football diving\", after his name.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his retirement as a player in 1986, Chiarugi joined the &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; youth team coaching staff. In his career, he served as Fiorentina's &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20manager\"&gt;Caretaker manager&lt;/a&gt; three times. Late into the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1992\u201393 season&lt;/a&gt;, Chiarugi (jointly with &lt;a href=\"Giancarlo%20Antognoni\"&gt;Giancarlo Antognoni&lt;/a&gt;) replaced &lt;a href=\"Aldo%20Agroppi\"&gt;Aldo Agroppi&lt;/a&gt; with little fortune, as he did not manage to save them from relegation to Serie B after 54 consecutive seasons in the top flight. In &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%202000-01\"&gt;February 2001&lt;/a&gt;, following the dismissal of &lt;a href=\"Fatih%20Terim\"&gt;Fatih Terim&lt;/a&gt;, Chiarugi was installed as caretaker coach for a single match, a 2\u20131 loss to &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Bari\"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;, before the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Mancini\"&gt;Roberto Mancini&lt;/a&gt;. Following the departure of &lt;a href=\"Ottavio%20Bianchi\"&gt;Ottavio Bianchi&lt;/a&gt;, Chiarugi was appointed again as caretaker coach during the dramatic &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2001\u201302 season&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with relegation to Serie B and the successive club cancellation due to financial troubles, which ultimately led to Fiorentina's bankruptcy.\nOn 14 November 2007, he was announced as the new head coach of Tuscan &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C2\"&gt;Serie C2&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Poggibonsi\"&gt;Poggibonsi&lt;/a&gt;. He was sacked in September 2008 due to poor results.\nHonours.\nClub.\nFiorentina\nMilan\nNapoli"
