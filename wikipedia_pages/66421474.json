    "text": "Pammene rhediella is a &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the family &lt;a href=\"Tortricidae\"&gt;Tortricidae&lt;/a&gt;. The species was &lt;a href=\"species%20description\"&gt;first described&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Alexander%20Clerck\"&gt;Carl Alexander Clerck&lt;/a&gt; in 1759.\nIt is native to Europe. and across the &lt;a href=\"Palearctic\"&gt;Palearctic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wingspan is 9-12 millimeter. The forewings are dark fuscous. The central fascia is darker and ferruginous-tinged and the apical area beyond this wholly deep ferruginous-orange, with leaden-metallic spots and striae. The hindwings fuscous, in males with a blackish spot on vein 1c towards the termen.\nThe larva develops in the flowers and fruits of shrubs and trees in the rose family, most often on &lt;a href=\"Crataegus%20monogyna\"&gt;hawthorn&lt;/a&gt; but occasionally also on apple and pear. The adults fly in May-June, most during the day in hot sunshine over the tops of hawthorn-trees. Since the species' main nutrient plant is hawthorn, it is usually not considered a problematic pest, but if it attacks fruit trees it can do significant damage."
