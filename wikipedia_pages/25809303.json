    "text": "The Socialist Workers Party of Hungary () was a &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. The party was founded by &lt;a href=\"social%20democrats\"&gt;social democrats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"communists\"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt; in 1925, and led by &lt;a href=\"Istv%C3%A1n%20V%C3%A1gi\"&gt;Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1gi&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the established &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Socialist Workers Party sought to mobilize mass movements and agrarian struggles.\n&lt;a href=\"Imre%20Nagy\"&gt;Imre Nagy&lt;/a&gt;, the future &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956\"&gt;1956 Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, was involved in organizing the underground MSZMP chapter in his home town of &lt;a href=\"Kaposv%C3%A1r\"&gt;Kaposv\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; he helped establish during the Revolution was similarly named.\nThe right-wing government of &lt;a href=\"Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy\"&gt;Mikl\u00f3s Horthy&lt;/a&gt; cracked down on the party in 1928. Its leaders, such as V\u00e1gi and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s%20R%C3%A1kosi\"&gt;M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi&lt;/a&gt; were arrested and sentenced to one year in prison."
