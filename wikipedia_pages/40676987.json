The group was seated under the main clock of the &lt;a href=\"Makario%20Stadium\"&gt;Makario Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and later at the North stand. Until 2018, they were seated at the North stand of the &lt;a href=\"GSP%20Stadium\"&gt;GSP Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. They are fans of PAC Omonia.\nPopularity and Ideology.\nOmonia is the most popular team in Cyprus. Omonia supporters are traditionally left wing. A 2009 gallop poll estimated that three out of four Omonia fans vote for the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20of%20Working%20People\"&gt;Progressive Party of Working People&lt;/a&gt;, the communist party of Cyprus. While the group retains its left wing beliefs, in recent years it has been openly critical of the party's involvement in the club's administrative decisions. The party has denied accusations that it influences club decisions. Gate-9 members are associated with &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; beliefs and have been noted for waving banners bearing &lt;a href=\"Che%20Guevara\"&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/a&gt;'s portrait, and other communist symbols. The group is also involved in humanitarian work for refugees in Cyprus. The group, besides &lt;a href=\"Nicosia\"&gt;Nicosia&lt;/a&gt;, has fan clubs in &lt;a href=\"Limassol\"&gt;Limassol&lt;/a&gt;,athens,thessaloniki and in London. &lt;a href=\"Larnaka\"&gt;Larnaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paphos\"&gt;Paphos&lt;/a&gt;.\nViolence.\nThe group often engages in violent clashes with members of police or supporters of other teams.\nIn November 2009 the group was involved in clashes with fans of local rivals &lt;a href=\"APOEL%20FC\"&gt;APOEL FC&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in a serious injury of an APOEL fan.\nA basketball match in January 2012 was interrupted by the group entering the pitch.\nIn March 2012 after a football match, the group caused damage to the &lt;a href=\"GSP%20Stadium\"&gt;GSP Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and injured 11 policemen.\nAnother football match was interrupted by clashes between the group and &lt;a href=\"Anorthosis%20Famagusta\"&gt;Anorthosis Famagusta&lt;/a&gt; fans in June 2013.\nDuring a volleyball match in March 2014 rioting by Gate 9 led to 11 members of the group being arrested. Clashes occurred at the coastal city of &lt;a href=\"Larnaca\"&gt;Larnaca&lt;/a&gt; on the 22nd of July 2014, between fans of &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonia%20Bia%C5%82ystok\"&gt;Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok&lt;/a&gt; and Cypriots. Jagiellonia would face Omonia the next day for the &lt;a href=\"Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; qualifications. It was strongly hinted on social media by Gate 9 members that the group was involved in the clashes. On 18 May 2016 riots broke out outside the group's clubhouse in Nicosia between Gate 9 members and riot police. Later that day in Limassol around 20 members of the group were involved in clashes with fans of Apollon Limassol after the Cypriot Cup Final.\nAlso in 15 November 2011, Omonoia fans assaulted APOEL fans in Nuevo Campo (near the new GSP stadium). in addition, they beat apoel fans in akropoli, griva digeni street, pilavaki in 2017, in papanikoli street."
