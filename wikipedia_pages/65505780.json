She received orders on 14 June 1944 to move to a new patrol area north of &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, and on 16 June 1944 she was reassigned to Patrol Unit C along with the submarines , , and . Ordered on 22 June 1944 to return to base, she arrived at &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk&lt;/a&gt; on 27 June 1944.\nJuly\u2013August 1944.\nOn 10 July 1944, \"Ro-113\" departed Truk bound for &lt;a href=\"Sasebo\"&gt;Sasebo&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, which she reached on 17 July 1944. On 15 August 1944, Submarine Division 51 was disbanded, and \"Ro-113\" and \"Ro-115\" were reassigned directly to Submarine Squadron 8 in the 6th Fleet. \"Ro-113\" departed Kure on 7 September 1944 and headed for &lt;a href=\"Penang%20Island\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese-occupied &lt;a href=\"British%20Malaya\"&gt;British Malaya&lt;/a&gt;, arriving there on 27 September 1944 for operations in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond war patrol.\n\"Ro-113\" got underway from Penang on 25 October 1944 to begin her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Bengal\"&gt;Bay of Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 November 1944 she torpedoed and sank the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; 3,827-&lt;a href=\"gross%20register%20ton\"&gt;gross register ton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"merchant%20ship\"&gt;merchant ship&lt;/a&gt; \"Marion Moller\" \u2014 the last &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; ship torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Indian Ocean \u2014 in the Bay of Bengal at . The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s , , and arrived on the scene a few hours later and began a pursuit of \"Ro-113\". The British &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%2066\"&gt;Task Force 66&lt;/a&gt;, centered round the &lt;a href=\"escort%20aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;escort aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s and , also became involved, but \"Ro-113\" escaped and returned to Penang on 13 November 1944.\nThird war patrol.\n\"Ro-113\" began her third war patrol on 28 November 1944, again tasked with attacking Allied shipping in the Bay of Bengal. A &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; attacked her in the Bay of Bengal off &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, on 3 December 1944, but she survived undamaged. She reported sinking a &lt;a href=\"Transport%20%28ship%29\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt; on 18 December 1944 and a second transport on 19 December, but postwar analysis found no evidence of her having sunk any ships on these dates. Off Penang as \"Ro-113\" was concluding her patrol, the Royal Navy submarine fired six torpedoes at her, all of which exploded prematurely, leading \"Thule\"\u2032s commanding officer to claim the sinking of \"Ro-113\", but \"Ro-113\" survived and reached Penang safely.\nFourth war patrol.\n\"Ro-113\" began her fourth war patrol on 20 January 1945, departing Penang, pausing briefly at &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; later in the day, and then heading for her patrol area in the &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20Sea\"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt; west of Luzon. On 4 February 1945, the 6th Fleet ordered \"Ro-113\" and the submarines , , and \"Ro-115\" to proceed to &lt;a href=\"Kaohsiung\"&gt;Takao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Formosa\"&gt;Formosa&lt;/a&gt;, unload their reserve torpedoes and deck gun ammunition there, and then head for &lt;a href=\"Batulinao\"&gt;Batulinao&lt;/a&gt; on the northern coast of Luzon to rescue &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&lt;/a&gt; pilots stranded in Luzon's &lt;a href=\"Aparri\"&gt;Aparri&lt;/a&gt; area and transport them to Takao. After calling at Takao from 7\u00a0to\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a01945, \"Ro-113\" got back underway and set course for Batulinao.\nLoss.\n\"Ro-113\" was on the surface in the &lt;a href=\"Luzon%20Strait\"&gt;Luzon Strait&lt;/a&gt; in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Babuyan%20Island\"&gt;Babuyan Island&lt;/a&gt; north of Luzon in the predawn darkness of 13 February 1945 when the U.S. Navy submarine detected her on &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; at 02:15 bearing 220 degrees from \"Batfish\" at a range of . \"Batfish\" lost contact at 02:41 at a range of when \"Ro-113\" submerged.\nAt 03:10, \"Ro-113\" surfaced and \"Batfish\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"radar%20detector\"&gt;radar detector&lt;/a&gt; picked up her radar emissions. \"Batfish\" also detected her on radar at a range of bearing 336 degrees from \"Batfish\". At 04:12, \"Batfish\" submerged to radar depth along \"Ro-113\"\u2032s track with \"Ro-113\" yards away and closing. At 04:48, \"Batfish\" fired three torpedoes from her &lt;a href=\"stern\"&gt;stern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s for a run to their target. At 04:49, the first torpedo hit \"Ro-113\", creating a large yellow fireball and blowing her apart. \"Ro-113\" sank with all hands at , going under so quickly that \"Batfish\"\u2032s second and third torpedoes missed.\nOn 20 February 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared \"Ro-113\" to be presumed lost in the Luzon Strait with all 59 men on board. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 10 May 1945."
