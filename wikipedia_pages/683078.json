    "text": "Necker Island, in &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20language\"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; Mokumanamana (\"Branched Island\"), is a small island in the &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Northwestern Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt;. It is located at in the Pacific Ocean, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Nihoa\"&gt;Nihoa&lt;/a&gt;, and north of the &lt;a href=\"Tropic%20of%20Cancer\"&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;State of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It contains important prehistoric archaeological sites of the Hawaiian culture and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Papah%C4%81naumoku%C4%81kea%20Marine%20National%20Monument\"&gt;Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; reports Necker Island's land area as . The island is rocky with steep sides and has very little soil. Its highest elevation is . The island is named after &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Necker\"&gt;Jacques Necker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Finance%20Ministers%20of%20France\"&gt;finance minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministration.\nPolitically, Necker Island is part of the &lt;a href=\"City%20and%20County%20of%20Honolulu\"&gt;City and County of Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;State of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. However, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, it is administered by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;United States Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt;. It has no resident human population.\nGeography.\nThe remnant of a &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20cone\"&gt;volcanic cone&lt;/a&gt;, Necker Island is located about southeast of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Frigate%20Shoals\"&gt;French Frigate Shoals&lt;/a&gt; on the northwestern end of a large, shallow &lt;a href=\"ocean%20bank\"&gt;ocean bank&lt;/a&gt;. It is a hook-shaped rocky ridge about long and between wide. Composed of &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;, the island is steep-sided and barren, with very little soil, and its rocks are heavily scoured and &lt;a href=\"Erosion\"&gt;eroded&lt;/a&gt;. It is the second-smallest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, with a total area of according to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; or or according to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;United States Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe westernmost point on Necker Island is Mo'o Point (or Mo'o Head). The island's \"hook\" is Northwest Cape, a narrow spur that reaches a maximum height of 48 meters (156\u00a0ft) and juts northeastward from the west end of the island for . Northwest Cape is connected to the rest of the island by a narrow gap that is barely above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. Northwest Cape's tip is the northernmost point of the island.\nThe main ridge of the island and Northwest Cape combine to partially enclose Shark Bay along the northern shore of the island; the bay opens to the northeast and usually is subject to rough seas. Along the island's western shore, West Cove lies between Mo'o Point and the southern end of Northwest Cape. A small &lt;a href=\"islet\"&gt;islet&lt;/a&gt;, long and rising above sea level, lies just off Necker Island's eastern tip.\nThe main ridge of Necker Island has five peaks. East to west, they are:\nBowl Cave is located on the northern slope of Bowl Hill. It is an important &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20site\"&gt;archaeological site&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecker Island has an average annual rainfall of just under .\nFlora and fauna.\nVegetation on Necker Island is limited to low shrubs and grasses, none more than tall. Five species of plants are known to occur:\nThe &lt;a href=\"forester\"&gt;forester&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Territory of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; attempted to introduce six other species of plants to Necker Island in June 1923, but all had died out by the latter half of the 1930s, if not earlier.\nThe island is also noted for large numbers of birds. About 16 species of &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt; nest on Necker Island; during nesting season, an estimated 60,000 birds nest on the island, and their eggs cover virtually every piece of level ground. A seabird first observed at Necker Island and at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Frigate%20Shoals\"&gt;French Frigate Shoals&lt;/a&gt; and Nihoa in 1902 originally was thought to be new to science and was given the &lt;a href=\"scientific%20name\"&gt;scientific name&lt;/a&gt; \"Procelsterna saxatalis\" and the popular name \"Necker Island tern,\" but it later was identified as a &lt;a href=\"subspecies\"&gt;subspecies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue-grey%20noddy\"&gt;blue-grey noddy&lt;/a&gt;, already known from farther south in the Pacific. No land birds live on the island. Land animals found on the island include &lt;a href=\"land%20snail\"&gt;land snail&lt;/a&gt;s and 15 &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of insect found nowhere else, as well as &lt;a href=\"wolf%20spider\"&gt;wolf spider&lt;/a&gt;s and bird &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough it is the second-smallest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Necker Island has the second-largest surrounding &lt;a href=\"Marine%20habitats\"&gt;marine habitat&lt;/a&gt; among the islands, totaling , with Shark Bay, West Cove, Northwest Cape, and miles of shallow &lt;a href=\"reef\"&gt;reef&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast of the island providing large offshore habitats. Runoff from the heavily eroded rock surfaces of the island and the constant wave action that scours its underwater basalt structure interfere with the growth of &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s; little coral life exists in the shallow areas surrounding the island, and it lacks a fringing &lt;a href=\"reef\"&gt;reef&lt;/a&gt;. However, 16 species of &lt;a href=\"Scleractinia\"&gt;stony coral&lt;/a&gt; live in the area, and Necker is the easternmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago where table corals of the &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Acropora\"&gt;Acropora&lt;/a&gt;\" are found. &lt;a href=\"Gray%20reef%20shark\"&gt;Gray reef shark&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"manta%20ray\"&gt;manta ray&lt;/a&gt;s are common off the island, and &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20monk%20seal\"&gt;Hawaiian monk seal&lt;/a&gt;s populate its shores, some giving birth to pups there. &lt;a href=\"Green%20sea%20turtle\"&gt;Green sea turtle&lt;/a&gt;s bask on the shore in the narrow gap between the main island and Northwest Cape, but they do not breed on Necker Island because the island lacks sandy beaches in which they could lay their eggs. A great abundance and diversity of &lt;a href=\"sea%20cucumber\"&gt;sea cucumber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20urchin\"&gt;sea urchin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lobster\"&gt;lobster&lt;/a&gt;s live in Shark Bay. Extensive deeper \"shelves\" extend many miles from the island's shallow reef, especially to the southeast, and &lt;a href=\"commercial%20fishing\"&gt;commercial fishing&lt;/a&gt; takes place over these shelves, which produce much of Hawaii's catch of &lt;a href=\"green%20jobfish\"&gt;green jobfish&lt;/a&gt;, known locally as gray snapper or \"uku\". &lt;a href=\"Deep%20sea%20fish\"&gt;Deep sea fish&lt;/a&gt; types that live hundreds of meters (yards) below the surface along the underwater slopes of Necker Island include fishes of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20%28biology%29\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stomiiformes\"&gt;Stomiiformes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gadiformes\"&gt;Gadiformes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Myctophiformes\"&gt;Myctophiformes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aulopiformes\"&gt;Aulopiformes&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaeology.\nNecker Island is known for its numerous religious sites and cultural objects. There are few, if any, signs of long-term habitation, giving rise to the theory that people visited the island for short periods instead of settling it. Many &lt;a href=\"Anthropology\"&gt;anthropologists&lt;/a&gt; believe that the island was a ceremonial and religious site. Necker has dozens of stone artifact sites which are thought to be ritual shrines; according to one source archaeologists believe that at least 52 religious sites existed on the island, while another states that 55 cultural sites have been discovered, of which 33 are religious, 17 are shelter caves \u2014 of which Bowl Cave is the largest \u2014 and two sites had an as-yet undetermined function. Apparently, the cultural sites on Necker Island predate the abandonment of Hawaiian settlements on &lt;a href=\"Nihoa\"&gt;Nihoa&lt;/a&gt; in the eighteenth century, perhaps by several centuries.\nNumerous artifacts have been found on visits to the island, and among the most mysterious are a dozen or so carved stone sculptures of little, neckless people. The sculptures are not more than a long, and do not match the style of Hawaiian or other &lt;a href=\"Polynesia\"&gt;Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;n idols. According to the myths and legends of the people of &lt;a href=\"Kauai\"&gt;Kauai&lt;/a&gt;, which lies to the southeast, Necker Island was the last known refuge for a race of mythical \"little people\" called the \"&lt;a href=\"Menehune\"&gt;Menehune&lt;/a&gt;\". According to the legend, the \"Menehune\" settled on Necker Island after being chased off Kauai by the stronger &lt;a href=\"Polynesian%20people\"&gt;Polynesians&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently built the various stone structures there.\nOther artifacts found on the island include carved stone bowls and various tools such as &lt;a href=\"adze\"&gt;adze&lt;/a&gt;s. The abandoned sites seen by early explorers caused Necker Island and &lt;a href=\"Nihoa\"&gt;Nihoa&lt;/a&gt; to be called the \"mystery islands.\"\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Geology\"&gt;Geological&lt;/a&gt; research in the early 21st century indicates that Necker Island is about 10 million years old. While it rises only about 84 meters (277\u00a0ft) above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; now, it reached in height earlier in its history and at one time was comparable in size to modern &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20people\"&gt;Hawaiians&lt;/a&gt; appear to have started visiting Necker Island a few hundred years after they settled the main Hawaiian Islands. Archaeologists believe that the island's poor soil for farming and its small size and relative lack of rainfall made it uninhabitable, and that the Hawaiians visited from Nihoa and other nearby islands to worship at religious sites without establishing any permanent settlements. Their visits appear to have ended a few hundred years before &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; contact, and by the time Europeans first visited Hawaii in the late eighteenth century, Necker Island apparently was unknown to the Hawaiians.\nThe French explorer &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Galaup%2C%20comte%20de%20La%20P%C3%A9rouse\"&gt;Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse&lt;/a&gt; was on a mission of exploration for the &lt;a href=\"French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;French Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; aboard the ships \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Astrolabe%20%281781%29\"&gt;L'Astrolabe&lt;/a&gt;\" (under command of &lt;a href=\"Fleuriot%20de%20Langle\"&gt;Fleuriot de Langle&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Boussole%20%281781%29\"&gt;La Boussole&lt;/a&gt;\" that made many discoveries across the Pacific \u2014 and had just discovered the &lt;a href=\"French%20Frigate%20Shoals\"&gt;French Frigate Shoals&lt;/a&gt; (\" Basse des Fr\u00e9gates Fran\u00e7aises\") and his namesake rock &lt;a href=\"La%20Perouse%20Pinnacle\"&gt;La Perouse Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 when on November 4, 1786, he became the first European to visit Necker Island. La P\u00e9rouse did not attempt to land on the island due to its nearly vertical sides and the violent seas breaking on its shore, but he sailed within a third of a &lt;a href=\"League%20%28unit%29\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; of it and named it after &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Necker\"&gt;Jacques Necker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Geneva\"&gt;Genevan&lt;/a&gt; banker and statesman who served as finance minister for &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVI of France&lt;/a&gt;. Although the expedition was lost at sea in 1788, it was able to send its logs home before its loss, bringing the island's existence to the attention of Europeans. The first people to set foot on Necker Island in modern times appear to have been the British seaman &lt;a href=\"John%20Turnbull%20%28voyager%29\"&gt;John Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; of the ship \"Margaret\", who visited the Hawaiian Islands between December 17, 1802, and January 21, 1803, and two Hawaiian &lt;a href=\"pearl%20diver\"&gt;pearl diver&lt;/a&gt;s in his employ; the three men landed on the island during an expedition to find &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt;s on a reef in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.\n&lt;a href=\"Sea%20captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; John or William Paty (sources disagree on Paty's first name) claimed Necker Island for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Kingdom of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in 1857, although he did not land on the island. The claim was disputed over the following decades. In January 1859, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20%28naval%29\"&gt;Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; J. M. Brook aboard the &lt;a href=\"Survey%20ship\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; visited Necker Island and determined its position. During the summer of 1859, Captain N. C. Brook of the Hawaiian &lt;a href=\"barque\"&gt;barque&lt;/a&gt; \"Gambia\" passed the island during a &lt;a href=\"Seal%20hunting\"&gt;sealing&lt;/a&gt; and exploration voyage, but did not report landing on it.\nAs late as the early 1890s, the Kingdom of Hawaii's claim to Necker Island remained in dispute, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; was considering the island as a potential waypoint location for a &lt;a href=\"submarine%20communications%20cable\"&gt;submarine communications cable&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"telegraph\"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt; network known informally as the &lt;a href=\"All%20Red%20Line\"&gt;All Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893 and replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Provisional Government of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, and when the British &lt;a href=\"corvette\"&gt;corvette&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; in 1894, the provisional government's president, &lt;a href=\"Sanford%20B.%20Dole\"&gt;Sanford B. Dole&lt;/a&gt;, became concerned that the United Kingdom was about to establish a claim to Necker Island. Wishing to curry favor with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; rather than the United Kingdom, Dole immediately dispatched an expedition under Captain &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20King\"&gt;James A. King&lt;/a&gt; to Necker to &lt;a href=\"Annexation\"&gt;annex&lt;/a&gt; the island. On May 27, 1894, a landing party of 12 men led by King went ashore on Necker for four hours, raised the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;flag of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; on what became known as Annexation Hill, and read an annexation proclamation. The move brought international disputes over claims to the island to an end and the island was included in the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Republic of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; when it was founded on July 4, 1894, although the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt; continued to attempt to negotiate with the Hawaiian government over use of Necker Island and on September 24, 1894, \"Champion\" landed a party on the island. On July 12, 1895, King led a Hawaiian government expedition \u2014 which also included the first director of the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Museum\"&gt;Bishop Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Tufts%20Brigham\"&gt;William Tufts Brigham&lt;/a&gt;, and Professor &lt;a href=\"William%20DeWitt%20Alexander\"&gt;William DeWitt Alexander&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to Necker to &lt;a href=\"Surveying\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cartography\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; the island and conduct archaeological research. On August 12, 1898, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; annexed Hawaii, including Necker Island, and Necker was included in the &lt;a href=\"Territory%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Territory of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; upon its creation on April 30, 1900.\nIn 1902, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20Commission\"&gt;United States Fish Commission&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research%20ship\"&gt;research ship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"USS%20Albatross%20%281882%29\"&gt;USFC \"Albatross\"&lt;/a&gt; visited Necker Island, and her personnel thought they discovered the \"Necker Island tern\" there, as well as on Nihoa and at the French Frigate Shoals, during their visit, although the bird later was determined to be a subspecies of the blue-grey noddy, already known from farther south in the Pacific. The island was leased for &lt;a href=\"commercial%20fishing\"&gt;commercial fishing&lt;/a&gt; purposes for 21 years on June 2, 1904, and on February 3, 1909, it became part of the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands%20Bird%20Reservation\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation&lt;/a&gt;, managed jointly by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the Territory of Hawaii.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20N.%20Wilcox\"&gt;George N. Wilcox&lt;/a&gt; visited Necker Island twice on unrecorded dates, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service\"&gt;United States Revenue Cutter Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"revenue%20cutter\"&gt;revenue cutter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"USS%20Thetis%20%281881%29\"&gt;USRC \"Thetis\"&lt;/a&gt; visited the island in 1910 and 1913, as did an expedition led by H. L. Tucker in 1917. The warden of the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands%20Bird%20Reservation\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation&lt;/a&gt; landed on the island on October 6, 1919 and found stone artifacts during his visit. The &lt;a href=\"Tanager%20Expedition\"&gt;\"Tanager\" Expedition&lt;/a&gt; visited Necker Island in 1923 and 1924, and is noted for exploring the island's &lt;a href=\"biology\"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;; during its first visit, from June 12 to 29, 1923, it mapped the island and studied its flora and fauna in detail, and on its return visit from July 14 to July 17, 1924, it conducted a thorough &lt;a href=\"Survey%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;archaeological survey&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 21, 1959, the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;State of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; was created, and Necker was included in the new &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;. Because of Necker Island's usage by &lt;a href=\"Native%20Hawaiian\"&gt;Native Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;s as a ceremonial and religious site in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hawaii\"&gt;Ancient Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Government\"&gt;United States Government&lt;/a&gt; added the island to its &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. In 1997, members of the &lt;a href=\"Native%20Hawaiian\"&gt;Native Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; organization \"Hui M\u00e4lama I N\u00e4 Kupuna O Hawai\u02bbi Nei\" (\"Hawai\u02bbi Ancestral Care Association\") visited the island to rebury human bones found there which had been transported to Honolulu and kept at &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Museum\"&gt;Bishop Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 21st century, Necker Island was a place of study for &lt;a href=\"benthic\"&gt;benthic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invertebrates\"&gt;invertebrates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algae\"&gt;algal&lt;/a&gt; assemblages. On June 15, 2006, the United States established the &lt;a href=\"Papah%C4%81naumoku%C4%81kea%20Marine%20National%20Monument\"&gt;Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument&lt;/a&gt;, with Necker Island within its boundaries.\nAccess.\nAccess to Necker Island is by boat, and is quite difficult because of the island's nearly vertical coastline. Heavy surf usually precludes landings along the coast in Shark Bay, but a small &lt;a href=\"Windward%20and%20leeward\"&gt;lee&lt;/a&gt; exists west of Northwest Cape, and landing on rocky shelves there is possible in moderately calm weather but can be dangerous in high surf.\nVisits to Necker Island are permitted only for scientific, educational, and cultural purposes and require the approval of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which gives preference to scientific and cultural visits."
