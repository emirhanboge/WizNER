    "text": "Mark 3 is the third chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Mark\"&gt;Gospel of Mark&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Testament\"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;. It relates a conflict over healing on the &lt;a href=\"Sabbath%20in%20Christianity\"&gt;Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"commissioning%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles\"&gt;commissioning of the Twelve Apostles&lt;/a&gt;, a conflict with &lt;a href=\"scribes\"&gt;scribes&lt;/a&gt; and a meeting of &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;his own family&lt;/a&gt;.\nText.\nThe original text was written in &lt;a href=\"Koine%20Greek\"&gt;Koine Greek&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chapters%20and%20verses%20of%20the%20Bible\"&gt;This chapter is divided into&lt;/a&gt; 35 verses.\nTextual witnesses.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\nHealings.\nContinuing the theme of the &lt;a href=\"Sabbath\"&gt;Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mark%202%23The%20Sabbath\"&gt;the previous chapter&lt;/a&gt;, Mark 3 begins with Jesus healing a man with a shriveled or withered hand on the Sabbath in the &lt;a href=\"Synagogue\"&gt;Synagogue&lt;/a&gt;. The word \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd (\"ex\u0113rammen\u0113n\") is translated as \"paralyzed\" in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Standard%20Version\"&gt;International Standard Version&lt;/a&gt;. Mark uses the &lt;a href=\"adverb\"&gt;adverb&lt;/a&gt; \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd (\"palin\", again), indicating this is the synagogue in &lt;a href=\"Capernaum\"&gt;Capernaum&lt;/a&gt;, the same as the one in , although the &lt;a href=\"New%20American%20Standard%20Bible\"&gt;New American Standard Bible&lt;/a&gt; reads \"a synagogue\".\nAccording to Mark, \"some\" people were there specifically waiting to see if Jesus would heal someone on the Sabbath so that they could accuse him of breaking it. &lt;a href=\"Rabbi\"&gt;Rabbi&lt;/a&gt;s of the time would allow healing on the Sabbath only if the person was in great danger, a situation his hand would not qualify for. The &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; article on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp%3Fartid%3D254%26amp%3Bletter%3DJ%26amp%3Bsearch%3DJesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; notes: \"... stricter rabbis allowed only the saving of life to excuse the slightest curtailment of the Sabbath rest (Shab. xxii. 6).\"\nHe asks the people \"Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do &lt;a href=\"Goodness%20and%20value%20theory\"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; or to do &lt;a href=\"evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;, to save life or to kill?\" () They do not answer and he angrily looks around at the crowd and is \"distressed at their stubborn hearts\" (). &lt;a href=\"Methodism\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley\"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/a&gt; suggested that his adversaries were already seeking occasion to kill him. He tells the man to put out his hand which he does and then, seemingly instantaneously, it is healed. Many other stories of healing at the time involved the healer doing work in some way to effect a cure as compared to this quick almost effortless action here. Mark could be highlighting how great he viewed Jesus' powers as being. Jesus also equates not doing good with doing evil and says it is more important, even or perhaps especially, to not let evil and suffering occur through inaction.\nAccording to Mark, this &lt;a href=\"miracle\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; is the spur which sets the &lt;a href=\"Pharisees\"&gt;Pharisees&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Herodians\"&gt;Herodians&lt;/a&gt;, against Jesus, having them go out after this and plot to kill him. Thus the reaction of a substantial number of &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; has gone from being amazed to one of outright opposition. Mark has already begun to foreshadow Jesus' death, with this as well as the saying about the bridegroom and fasting in . Some find it improbable these two groups worked together, as the Pharisees opposed &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herod%20Antipas\"&gt;Herod&lt;/a&gt; was backed by and supported Rome, see also &lt;a href=\"Iudaea%20Province\"&gt;Iudaea Province&lt;/a&gt;. Mark however may be highlighting the dual nature and seriousness of the opposition to Jesus.\nThis also occurs in &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Matthew\"&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D47%26amp%3Bchapter%3D12%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;12:9-14&lt;/a&gt;, although Jesus asks about how one would save a sheep on the Sabbath and how helping a person is more important than helping a sheep. &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Luke\"&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D49%26amp%3Bchapter%3D6%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;6:6-11&lt;/a&gt; is almost the same as this section of Mark although Luke does not state that they planned to kill him, only that they were \"furious\" and talked about what to do about Jesus.\nJesus then \"withdraws\", \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd (\"anech\u014dr\u0113sen\"), and goes down by a lake, presumably the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Galilee\"&gt;Sea of Galilee&lt;/a&gt;, and people follow him there. Some writers, such as the American commentator &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Barnes%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;Albert Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, see the word as meaning flight, as it comes after Mark talks about the plot against Jesus, \"... to the lonely regions which surrounded the sea, where he might be in obscurity, and avoid their designs against his life\", but it could just as easily mean leaving &lt;a href=\"Capernaum\"&gt;Capernaum&lt;/a&gt; to go to the nearby sea. Mark says the people had come from \"... &lt;a href=\"Judea\"&gt;Judea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edom\"&gt;Idumea&lt;/a&gt;, and the regions across the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20river\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a href=\"Tyre%2C%20Lebanon\"&gt;Tyre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sidon\"&gt;Sidon&lt;/a&gt;\". () Mark thus shows that people are coming from many areas, not just &lt;a href=\"Galilee\"&gt;Galilee&lt;/a&gt;. Whether these people were non-Jews is unclear as the non-Jewish areas listed also contained Jewish populations. Another group of the time to consider is the Jewish &lt;a href=\"Proselytes\"&gt;Proselytes&lt;/a&gt;.\nJesus has the &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;disciples&lt;/a&gt; prepare a boat for him to avoid \"crowding\", because \"...\u00a0he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.\" () and then he heals many of the sick. &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20possession\"&gt;Evil (or unclean) spirits in the people&lt;/a&gt; brought before him fall down and call him the &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20God\"&gt;Son of God&lt;/a&gt;, but he tells them not to tell people who he is, continuing the theme of the &lt;a href=\"Messianic%20Secret\"&gt;Messianic Secret&lt;/a&gt;.\nChoosing of the Twelve Apostles.\nAfter highlighting the growing crowd following Jesus, Mark says Jesus went up a mountain and called &lt;a href=\"12%20%28number%29\"&gt;twelve&lt;/a&gt;, whom he appointed Apostles, with the power to &lt;a href=\"Preaching\"&gt;preach&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Exorcism\"&gt;drive out demons&lt;/a&gt;\". Some manuscripts of Mark do not have Jesus call them Apostles in verse . Verse may be the only time he uses the word, which is most frequently (68 out of 79) used by &lt;a href=\"Luke%20the%20Evangelist\"&gt;Luke the Evangelist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20of%20Tarsus\"&gt;Paul of Tarsus&lt;/a&gt;, see &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.today/20121221041125/http%3A//www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl%3Fword%3D652\"&gt;Strong's G652&lt;/a&gt;. It is perhaps symbolic that this occurs on a mountain, a height where people can be met by God in the Jewish tradition, such as &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; talking to God on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Sinai\"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, see also the &lt;a href=\"Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount\"&gt;Sermon on the Mount&lt;/a&gt;. Mark pictures Jesus as drawing large multitudes to his teaching, and shifts from mountains to lakes to houses at will, creating an evocative landscape that some find lacking plausibility, although the area contains such geographic features.\nVerse 16.\nHe appoints Simon, called &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Andrew\"&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20the%20Apostle\"&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Bartholomew\"&gt;Bartholomew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Matthew\"&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20%28Apostle%29\"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a second &lt;a href=\"James%2C%20son%20of%20Alphaeus\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thaddaeus\"&gt;Thaddaeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Simon\"&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; whom Mark calls a &lt;a href=\"Zealot\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly &lt;a href=\"Judas%20Iscariot\"&gt;Judas Iscariot&lt;/a&gt;.\nLuke's lists in Luke and &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles\"&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt; do not include a Thaddaeus, but instead list \"Judas, son of James\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Jude%2C%20brother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Judas the brother of James&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"KJV\"&gt;KJV&lt;/a&gt;, which some have asserted are two names for the same person, &lt;a href=\"Jude%20Thaddaeus\"&gt;Jude Thaddaeus&lt;/a&gt;. Luke also has the story of the &lt;a href=\"Seventy%20Disciples\"&gt;Seventy Disciples&lt;/a&gt;. Matthew's list is the same as Mark in , although a few &lt;a href=\"Western%20text-type\"&gt;western manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; of Matthew have a &lt;a href=\"Lebbaeus\"&gt;Lebbaeus&lt;/a&gt;. This might also indicate that by the time of the writing of the Gospels the exact recollection of the \"minor\" Apostles had become uncertain, and that there is no \"Jude Thaddaeus\", a creation of later &lt;a href=\"hagiography\"&gt;hagiography&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20John\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; lists no Bartholomew, although John's &lt;a href=\"Nathanael\"&gt;Nathanael&lt;/a&gt; is usually equated with him.\nMark says that the brothers James and John were given the title \"&lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20of%20Jesus%23Boanerges%20.28.CE.92.CE.BF.CE.B1.CE.BD.CE.B7.CF.81.CE.B3.CE.B5.CF.82.29\"&gt;Boanerges&lt;/a&gt;\", which Mark tells us means \"Sons of Thunder\", although many modern scholars disagree with this translation. Many explanations have been given for this title but none commands a consensus. Mark does not explain why Jesus gave Simon the name Peter, meaning rock. has his naming in connection with the church and has it relate to his character. It could also have an ironic meaning, as even Peter denies Jesus in the end.\nPhilip and Andrew are both &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; names, also Thaddaeus and Lebbaeus. Some Jews, especially from places like Galilee where there were substantial non-Jewish populations, did have a Greek name as well as a Jewish name.\nThe second Simon is called a \"kananaios\", probably derived from the &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; word \"qan'\u0101n\u0101\", meaning a &lt;a href=\"Zealot\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt;, which might mean he belonged to a political movement in rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, but might also mean he was religiously zealous. Luke uses the Greek term \"z\u0113l\u014dt\u0113s\".\nIscariot might be Judas' last name or might be a reference to where he came from, meaning \"man of &lt;a href=\"Kerioth\"&gt;Kerioth&lt;/a&gt;\" It may also be derived from &lt;a href=\"sicarii\"&gt;sicarii&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that there are twelve Apostles is seen as being related to the &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20tribes%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Twelve tribes of Israel&lt;/a&gt;.\nJesus will \"send them out\", the Greek verb \"apostolien\" (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.today/20121220143742/http%3A//www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl%3Fstrongs%3D649\"&gt;Strong's G649&lt;/a&gt;) meaning to send out, to do the work he has been doing but without him being present. Many churches interpret this as his founding of the church, as he creates a special group to work in his name without him. See also the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Commission\"&gt;Great Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\nA house divided.\nJesus goes to someone's house (or \"the house\", possibly Peter's house, verse 19 in some versions, verse 20 in others), and a large crowd follows him there. According to Mark, this prevented Jesus and his disciples from being able to eat. \"When his family (\"hoi par' autou\") heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, 'He is out of his mind'.\" (), or \"beside himself\", \"exest\u0113\" (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.today/20121220194043/http%3A//www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl%3Fstrongs%3D1839\"&gt;Strong's G1839&lt;/a&gt;), which could be read as Jesus' family accusing him of being &lt;a href=\"mental%20illness\"&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; or describing what others had said about Jesus. Either way they go to assert their control over him, perhaps to stop him from embarrassing the family. Hearing Jesus is being followed by so many people does not seem to accord with their view of him. Whether it was Jesus teaching and attracting large crowds or not eating that disturbs them so much is not clear. A few early manuscripts have \"the scribes and the others\" instead of his family, but these are usually seen as alterations perhaps designed to tone down the impression of Jesus' own family toward him.\nScribes from &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, who Matthew says were Pharisees, come and accuse him of something worse than being crazy, using &lt;a href=\"Beelzebub\"&gt;Beelzebub&lt;/a&gt;, and/or the \"prince of demons\" to drive out demons. His power over the demons, they assert, comes from evil power itself. Beelzebub is thought to mean perhaps \"lord of the flies\" or \"lord of dung\" or \"lord of the height or dwelling\", but no certainty exists as to its exact meaning. They do not dispute that he did in fact drive out the demons. They seem to believe Jesus' power is beyond human capabilities and must be &lt;a href=\"supernatural\"&gt;supernatural&lt;/a&gt; in origin. The charge of Jesus using evil powers was probably made against him to his followers for quite some time after his death. The &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Seminar\"&gt;Jesus Seminar&lt;/a&gt; feels the version in is \"red\" (\"authentic\") and calls it \"the Beelzebul controversy\". is determined to be \"pink\" (\"a close approximation of what Jesus did\") and is called \"Jesus' relatives come to get him\" as are , , and the &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Thomas\"&gt;Gospel of Thomas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html\"&gt;99:1-3&lt;/a&gt; where they are called \"True relatives\".\nMark often has Jesus using &lt;a href=\"Analogy\"&gt;analogies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metaphor\"&gt;metaphor&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"riddle\"&gt;riddle&lt;/a&gt;s, called &lt;a href=\"parable\"&gt;parable&lt;/a&gt;s by Mark. Jesus replies:\nIf Jesus is working against what is evil, such as the demons, then this cannot be the work of Satan, as Satan would be working against himself. Jesus then compares himself to a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; going into a \"strong man's house\", and binding him to \"spoil his house\", i.e. to rob him. The \u201cstrong man\u201d is Satan. Satan, says Jesus, is strong and must be restrained in order to be robbed. He is robbing Satan of the possession of the people, or the house could be seen as the world itself. The &lt;a href=\"New%20Living%20Translation\"&gt;New Living Translation&lt;/a&gt; adds the interpretation that there is \"someone even stronger\". &lt;a href=\"George%20Maclear\"&gt;G. F. Maclear&lt;/a&gt; asserts that \"the Stronger than the Strong is Christ\".\nJesus thus implies what he has been doing is directly against Satan and that his motives are Satan's utmost ruin. His power, he asserts, is good and so must also come from a good source, God.\nJesus also makes the claim that \"all sins\" can be forgiven, except for an &lt;a href=\"eternal%20sin\"&gt;eternal sin&lt;/a&gt;, such as blasphemy against the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Spirit\"&gt;Holy Spirit&lt;/a&gt; (). Mark inserts his own explanation as to why Jesus said this, stating \"He said this because they were saying, \"He has an evil spirit.\" (), thus Jesus according to Mark is saying that accusing him of using Satan for his power is in effect calling the work of God evil and failing to see the work of God in Jesus' actions. The parallels in and and the Gospel of Thomas 44 call this the unforgivable sin. Unforgivable sins are also listed in &lt;a href=\"Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews\"&gt;Hebrews&lt;/a&gt; and as well as &lt;a href=\"First%20Epistle%20of%20John\"&gt;1 John&lt;/a&gt; . There is also a possible link with &lt;a href=\"First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians\"&gt;1 Corinthians&lt;/a&gt; . \nHis first answer to the charge, that a \"house divided\" cannot stand, has become a common piece of &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous modern example is &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Lincoln's&lt;/a&gt; use of this phrase during the 1858 senatorial election campaign against &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Douglas\"&gt;Stephen Douglas&lt;/a&gt;. Lincoln used the metaphor of a \"house divided\" to describe the situation of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nJesus' family.\nJesus' &lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20the%20mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt; arrive and send someone in to get him. He replies, speaking to the crowd around him, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's &lt;a href=\"Will%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; is my brother and sister and mother\" ().\nJesus' answer to his family, that those who follow him are his family is, according to Kilgallen, Jesus' way of underlining \"... the fact that his life has been changed to such a degree that family ties no longer come before those whom he teaches about the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20God\"&gt;kingdom of God&lt;/a&gt;\". Jesus puts loyalty to God above loyalty to family. Family ties were considered very important in the society of the time, and some people even today are troubled by this seeming conflict between Jesus and his family. Jesus however states that his ties, and his respect and love due to his family, will go to those who obey God. Jesus' family is mentioned again in Mark . The story of Jesus and his family is also found in the Gospel of Thomas as saying 99. In Mark , Peter says they have left everything to follow Jesus and he lists the great rewards as well as persecutions they will get for following him.\nThese incidents occur in all the &lt;a href=\"Synoptic%20Gospels\"&gt;Synoptic Gospels&lt;/a&gt;. In Matthew they occur in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D47%26amp%3Bchapter%3D12%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;12:22-50&lt;/a&gt;, and in Luke they are split up between &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D49%26amp%3Bchapter%3D8%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;8:19-21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D49%26amp%3Bchapter%3D11%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;11:14-28&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Matthew nor Luke though state that Jesus' family thought he was \"...\u00a0out of his mind.\" John, while mentioning none of these incidents, relates in chapter &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fbook_id%3D50%26amp%3Bchapter%3D7%26amp%3Bversion%3D31\"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; how \"... even his own brothers did not believe in him\" because he would not go to the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Tabernacles\"&gt;Feast of Tabernacles&lt;/a&gt; with them and perform miracles, although he later goes there in secret. says \"many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him\". The negative view of &lt;a href=\"Desposyni\"&gt;Jesus' family&lt;/a&gt; may be related to the conflict between Paul and &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Christians\"&gt;Jewish Christians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is much disagreement over whether these \"brothers\" referred to here are Jesus' actual brothers or merely stepbrothers or cousins. The official &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; doctrine is that &lt;a href=\"Perpetual%20virginity%20of%20Mary\"&gt;Mary was a perpetual virgin&lt;/a&gt;, and so could not have had any other children besides Jesus, thus making these Jesus' half brothers, sons of Joseph from another, unrecorded, marriage, or cousins. Only &lt;a href=\"Tertullian\"&gt;Tertullian&lt;/a&gt; seems to have questioned this in the early Church. &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; also holds that Mary was a perpetual virgin, as did many of the early &lt;a href=\"Protestants\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt;, although many Protestants today do not hold to the doctrine of perpetual virginity, and would thus believe that these are Jesus' full brothers. A few early manuscripts also have \"and your sisters\" in verse .\nThis section gives a clear example of Mark's sandwich technique, where one story is interspersed into the center of another. Mark has highlighted two reactions to Jesus and his teaching and acts: one of faith, such as that of his followers, and one of disbelief and hostility. Jesus explains the nature of the effect of his teachings on others in the &lt;a href=\"Parable%20of%20the%20Sower\"&gt;Parable of the Sower&lt;/a&gt; in ."
