Greasy Neale liked having the Eagles train away from Philadelphia and they only trained near their homebase when there were wartime travel restrictions during WW II. Under Neale the Eagles trained in Wisconsin, upstate New York and Minnesota when they could travel.\nNFL Draft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1947%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1947 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; was December 16, 1946. The NFL started a lottery of a bonus pick for the first pick in the draft. They did this until 1958.\nThe Eagles made 29 selections over the 32 rounds. They got the 6th or 7th pick in the rounds in which they had picks.\nThe top two picks in the draft was a lottery bonus pick as the number-one pick by the NFL champion &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Fenimore\"&gt;Bob Fenimore&lt;/a&gt;, a back who attended &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20State\"&gt;Oklahoma A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the number-two pick the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Lions\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; took 1946 &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Davis%20%28halfback%29\"&gt;Glenn Davis&lt;/a&gt; a halfback from &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;.

He was taken in error with the 9th pick in the 1946 draft when he was still a junior in college. He declined to play pro football.\nThe future NFL Hall of Famers that were in this draft where &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Lavelli\"&gt;Dante Lavelli&lt;/a&gt; (12th round), &lt;a href=\"Art%20Donovan\"&gt;Art Donovan&lt;/a&gt; (22nd round) and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Landry\"&gt;Tom Landry&lt;/a&gt; (20th round).\nSome players drafted were signed by &lt;a href=\"All-America%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;All-America Football Conference&lt;/a&gt; teams.\nDraft.\nThe table shows the Eagles selections and what picks they had that were traded away and the team that ended up with that pick.
