    "text": "Tarbat Ness (&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;: \"Rubha Thairbeirt\") is headland that lies at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Tarbat\"&gt;Tarbat&lt;/a&gt; peninsula in &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Ross\"&gt;Easter Ross&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. The name is from the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; \"tairbeart\" meaning \"&lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; \"ness\", meaning \"&lt;a href=\"headland\"&gt;headland&lt;/a&gt;\". It lies at the south of the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Dornoch%20Firth\"&gt;Dornoch Firth&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeology and geomorphology.\nThe Upper &lt;a href=\"Old%20Red%20Sandstone\"&gt;Old Red Sandstone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; period bedrock contains fish fossils. There are examples of a range of pitting, saltspray and honeycomb erosion and \"some of the best examples of differential erosion processes on tilted sandstone strata in Scotland\".\nThe height of the headland reaches 17m above sea level in the south and east and 10m in the north and west. The &lt;a href=\"raised%20beach\"&gt;raised beach&lt;/a&gt;es provide evidence of the post-glacial changes in sea level. Water depths offshore reach 10m at 300m offshore and 20m at circa offshore.\nHistory.\nAccording to the \"&lt;a href=\"Orkneyinga%20Saga\"&gt;Orkneyinga Saga&lt;/a&gt;\" the Norse &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Orkney\"&gt;Earl of Orkney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torf-Einarr\"&gt;Torf-Einarr&lt;/a&gt; \"was the first man to dig &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt; for fuel, firewood being very scarce on the islands, at Tarbat Ness\" (Torfness in the original). This is said to explain his nickname, \"torf\" meaning \"peat\", but it is clearly an absurd assertion.\nAt the Battle of Tarbat Ness in the 11th century, &lt;a href=\"Thorfinn%20the%20Mighty\"&gt;Thorfinn the Mighty&lt;/a&gt; defeated \"&lt;a href=\"Karl%20Hundason\"&gt;Karl Hundason&lt;/a&gt;\", possibly a Viking name for &lt;a href=\"Macbeth%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther down the peninsula near the village of &lt;a href=\"Portmahomack\"&gt;Portmahomack&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1480s the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ross\"&gt;Clan Ross&lt;/a&gt; slaughtered a raiding party from the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mackay\"&gt;Clan Mackay&lt;/a&gt; by locking them in the Tarbat Old Church and setting fire to it. This event is known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tarbat\"&gt;Battle of Tarbat&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 14 October 1941 a &lt;a href=\"Saro%20Lerwick\"&gt;Saro Lerwick&lt;/a&gt; flying boat assigned to No. 4 OTU \"L7268\" crashed into the sea near Tarbat Ness following failure of the port engine. The aircraft could not maintain altitude on single engine. Six of the crew were killed, three recovered alive.\nModern day.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tarbat%20Ness%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Tarbat Ness Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; is located at the north west tip of the peninsula. It was built in 1830 by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Stevenson%20%28civil%20engineer%29\"&gt;Robert Stevenson&lt;/a&gt; and has an elevation of and 203 steps to the top of the tower.\nThe restored Ballone Castle lies at the south east end of the peninsula north of the village of &lt;a href=\"Rockfield%2C%20Highland\"&gt;Rockfield&lt;/a&gt;."
