    "text": "Bestla (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt;: ) is a &lt;a href=\"j%C3%B6tunn\"&gt;j\u00f6tunn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Norse%20mythology\"&gt;Norse mythology&lt;/a&gt;, and the mother of the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Odin\"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vili%20and%20V%C3%A9\"&gt;Vili and V\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; (by way of &lt;a href=\"Borr\"&gt;Borr&lt;/a&gt;). She is also the sister of an unnamed man who assisted Odin, and the daughter (or granddaughter depending on the source) of the &lt;a href=\"j%C3%B6tunn\"&gt;j\u00f6tunn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B6l%C3%BEorn\"&gt;B\u00f6l\u00feorn&lt;/a&gt;. Odin is frequently called \"Bestla's son\" in both skaldic verses and the &lt;a href=\"Poetic%20Edda\"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/a&gt;.\nBestla is attested in the &lt;a href=\"Poetic%20Edda\"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/a&gt;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the &lt;a href=\"Prose%20Edda\"&gt;Prose Edda&lt;/a&gt;, written in the 13th century by &lt;a href=\"Snorri%20Sturluson\"&gt;Snorri Sturluson&lt;/a&gt;, and in the poetry of &lt;a href=\"skald\"&gt;skald&lt;/a&gt;s. Scholars have commented on the obscurity of the figure's name and have proposed various theories to explain the role and origin of the giantess.\nName.\nThe meaning of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; name \"Bestla\" remains uncertain. Scholars have proposed potential meanings such as 'wife', or '&lt;a href=\"Bark%20%28botany%29\"&gt;bark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bast%20fibre\"&gt;bast&lt;/a&gt;'. It might stem from \"*Bastil\u014dn\" (perhaps a yew goddess, originally a 'bast-donor'), or from \"*Banstill\u014dn\" (via an intermediate form \"*B\u00f6stla\"), related to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Frisian\"&gt;Old Frisian&lt;/a&gt; \"b\u00f6s\" ('marriage, union', originally 'wife').\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Simek\"&gt;Rudolf Simek&lt;/a&gt;, \"the name appears to be very old\" due to its obscurity.\nAttestations.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Gylfaginning\"&gt;Gylfaginning&lt;/a&gt;\" (The Beguiling of &lt;a href=\"Gylfi\"&gt;Gylfi&lt;/a&gt;), she is portrayed as the daughter of the giant &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B6l%C3%BEorn\"&gt;B\u00f6l\u00feorn&lt;/a&gt; and as the spouse of &lt;a href=\"Borr\"&gt;Borr&lt;/a&gt;, while the enthroned figure of &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A1rr\"&gt;H\u00e1rr&lt;/a&gt; (High) tells Gangleri (described as king &lt;a href=\"Gylfi\"&gt;Gylfi&lt;/a&gt; in disguise) of the genealogy of the god &lt;a href=\"Odin\"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l\"&gt;Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\" (The Language of Poetry), a poem by the &lt;a href=\"skald\"&gt;skald&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Einarr%20Helgason\"&gt;Einarr Helgarson&lt;/a&gt; refers to Odin as \"Bestla's son\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l\"&gt;H\u00e1vam\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\" makes B\u00f6l\u00feor(n) the grandfather of Bestla. Odin recounts his gaining of &lt;a href=\"Numbers%20in%20Norse%20mythology\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"galdr\"&gt;magical songs&lt;/a&gt; from Bestla's unnamed brother. If nothing indicates a family relationship between Odin and the man in the stanza (although skalds were certainly aware of Bestla as Odin's mother), and if the mead was allegedly stolen according to other sources, it is possible that Odin obtained magical songs from his maternal uncle.\nTheories.\nOn the basis of the \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\" stanza handled above (wherein Odin learns nine magic songs from the unnamed brother of Bestla), some scholars have theorized that Bestla's brother may in fact be the wise being &lt;a href=\"M%C3%ADmir\"&gt;M\u00edmir&lt;/a&gt;, from whose severed head the god Odin gains wisdom.\nSince Odin is descended from the j\u00f6tnar on his mother's side, the slaying of Ymir by him and his brothers could be seen as an intra-familial killing and, according to scholar &lt;a href=\"John%20Lindow\"&gt;John Lindow&lt;/a&gt;, \"the slaying or denial of a maternal relation\".\n&lt;a href=\"Waltraud%20Hunke\"&gt;Waltraud Hunke&lt;/a&gt; has argued that Bestla should be regarded as the bark of the &lt;a href=\"Yggdrasil\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; on which Odin was perhaps born, alluding to \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l\"&gt;H\u00e1vam\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\" : \"then I started to grow fruitful\".\nIn his translation of the \"Poetic Edda\", &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Adams%20Bellows%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Henry Adams Bellows&lt;/a&gt; comments that such the position of the stanza 140 in \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\" appears to be the result of &lt;a href=\"Interpolation%20%28manuscripts%29\"&gt;manuscript interpolation&lt;/a&gt;, and that its meaning is obscure."
