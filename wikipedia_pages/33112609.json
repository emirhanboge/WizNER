The film, narrated by Hines, was filmed at various locations including Atlanta, Georgia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Guerneville, California, and Seattle, Washington, and was shown at gay and documentary festivals. The television premiere was April 17, 2010, on the gay channel \"&lt;a href=\"Logo%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Logo&lt;/a&gt;\".\nChristopher Hines followed up \"The Butch Factor\" with the documentary \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adonis%20Factor\"&gt;The Adonis Factor&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010).\nSynopsis.\nThe documentary tackles meanings of &lt;a href=\"masculinity\"&gt;masculinity&lt;/a&gt; in gay men and culture through interviews with a great number of diverse gay men mixed with fast-paced sometimes archival tour of diverse groups of gay males from 1970s to contemporary times, with \"eye candy\" shots of men as well as analytical and expert presentations from writers, teachers, psychologists about their views of gay culture, masculinity, fetishism, discrimination, etc. It discusses how gay \"&lt;a href=\"Butch%20and%20femme%23Butch\"&gt;butch&lt;/a&gt;\" men often feel alone in their effort to integrate in general gay life as masculine males. Discussions include the butch gay stereotypes of &lt;a href=\"Leather%20subculture\"&gt;leather men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28gay%20culture%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rodeo\"&gt;rodeo&lt;/a&gt; riders, &lt;a href=\"Bodybuilding\"&gt;muscle men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"construction%20workers\"&gt;construction workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"truck%20drivers\"&gt;truck drivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"policemen\"&gt;policemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sportsmen\"&gt;sportsmen&lt;/a&gt;, and others, intertwined with questions of &lt;a href=\"homophobia\"&gt;homophobia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stereotyping\"&gt;stereotyping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metrosexual\"&gt;metrosexual&lt;/a&gt;ity, &lt;a href=\"effeminacy\"&gt;effeminacy&lt;/a&gt;, and fashion."
