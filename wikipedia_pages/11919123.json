    "text": "Gerald William Arrigo (born June 12, 1941) is an American former &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in 194 &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt;) for the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Twins\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; between and . Arrigo was a &lt;a href=\"left-handed\"&gt;left-hander&lt;/a&gt; who was listed as tall and weighed . He was a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Technical%20High%20School\"&gt;Harrison Technical High School&lt;/a&gt; in his native city of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis pro career began in 1960 in the White Sox organization. But after only one season in the Class D &lt;a href=\"Midwest%20League\"&gt;Midwest League&lt;/a&gt;, he was selected by the Twins in the first-year player draft then in effect. His first major league game occurred on June 12, 1961, when he &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fenway%20Park\"&gt;Fenway Park&lt;/a&gt;. After hurling a scoreless &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;first inning&lt;/a&gt;, he allowed three &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;earned run&lt;/a&gt;s on three &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"base%20on%20balls\"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"hit%20by%20pitch\"&gt;hit batsman&lt;/a&gt; in the second inning. He was charged with the Twins' eventual 10\u20138 loss. He worked in seven games for the 1961 Twins, then six total MLB games in and , which he spent primarily in &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrigo threw two one-hit games in his career. On June 26, 1964, he had a &lt;a href=\"no%20hitter\"&gt;no hitter&lt;/a&gt; going against the White Sox until &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Hershberger\"&gt;Mike Hershberger&lt;/a&gt; hit a &lt;a href=\"single%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; to center in the top of the ninth inning. His second one-hitter, which came on April 29, 1967, lacked the suspense of the first, as Arrigo gave up the only hit of the game to the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Grote\"&gt;Jerry Grote&lt;/a&gt; in the first inning.\nHe had his best all-around year in for the Reds, in his second tour of duty with the franchise. Appearing in 36 games (31 as starting pitcher) and 205 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;, his record was 12\u201310 with a 3.33 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; with 140 &lt;a href=\"strikeouts\"&gt;strikeouts&lt;/a&gt; and five &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArrigo went on to play his final major league game with the White Sox, his original organization, on June 5, 1970. In 194 MLB games, with 80 starts, he compiled a 35\u201340 (4.14) record, with nine complete games, three &lt;a href=\"shutout%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;shutouts&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;saves&lt;/a&gt;. In 620 innings pitched, he allowed 605 hits and 291 bases on balls, striking out 433. He retired from pro ball in 1971."
