    "text": "Alan Tinsley Powell (born November 10, 1951) is an American politician who has served in the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Georgia House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; since 1991. He was originally elected as a &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, but switched to a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, citing his &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; views.\nTenure.\nHe supported the &lt;a href=\"Election%20Integrity%20Act%20of%202021\"&gt;Election Integrity Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican-supported law to restrict voting rights in Georgia. Among its many provisions, it would restrict where &lt;a href=\"Ballot%20box\"&gt;ballot drop boxes&lt;/a&gt; can be located and when they can be accessed, require photo identification for &lt;a href=\"absentee%20voting\"&gt;absentee voting&lt;/a&gt;, shift back the deadline to request an absentee ballot, limit &lt;a href=\"early%20voting\"&gt;early voting&lt;/a&gt; hours, and prevent anyone other than poll workers from giving food and water to voters standing in lines. Most controversially, it would restrict early voting on Sundays, when &lt;a href=\"Black%20church\"&gt;Black churches&lt;/a&gt; traditionally run \"Souls to the Polls\" &lt;a href=\"Get%20out%20the%20vote\"&gt;get-out-the-vote&lt;/a&gt; efforts. Powell defended the bill, saying \"Show me the suppression. There is no suppression in this bill.\" The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled legislature in Georgia shortly after the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Georgia%20elections\"&gt;2020 elections&lt;/a&gt; when Democrats won the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since &lt;a href=\"1992%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. Then-President &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and his allies made false claims of fraud in multiple states, including Georgia, after they lost the elections."
