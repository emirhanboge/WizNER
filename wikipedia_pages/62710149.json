    "text": "The is an &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20site\"&gt;archaeological site&lt;/a&gt; containing the remnants of a number of &lt;a href=\"Anagama%20kiln\"&gt;Anagama kiln&lt;/a&gt;s, from which the &lt;a href=\"roof%20tile\"&gt;roof tile&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Kamakura%20period\"&gt;Kamakura period&lt;/a&gt; reconstruction of the temple of &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Ddai-ji\"&gt;T\u014ddai-ji&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nara%20%28city%29\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; were made. The site is located in the Irago neighborhood of the city of &lt;a href=\"Tahara%2C%20Aichi\"&gt;Tahara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aichi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Aichi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"T%C5%8Dkai%20region\"&gt;T\u014dkai region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It was designated a &lt;a href=\"Monuments%20of%20Japan\"&gt;National Historic Site of Japan&lt;/a&gt; in 1967.\nOverview.\nIn 1180 AD, during the &lt;a href=\"Genpei%20War\"&gt;Genpei War&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href=\"Heian%20period\"&gt;Heian period&lt;/a&gt;, the great temple of T\u014ddai-ji was burned down by &lt;a href=\"Taira%20clan\"&gt;Heike&lt;/a&gt; forces. The temple was rebuilt by the &lt;a href=\"Kamakura%20shogunate\"&gt;Kamakura shogunate&lt;/a&gt; in 1195 AD. During the construction of the Hatsutachiike irrigation dam at the tip of &lt;a href=\"Atsumi%20Peninsula\"&gt;Atsumi Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in 1966, the remnants of a kiln were discovered. This lent evidence to local legend that the tiles for the temple of T\u014ddai-ji had been produced from clay in this area. Further investigation of shards found at the site, as well as earlier finds from the &lt;a href=\"Edo%20period\"&gt;Edo period&lt;/a&gt; in this neighborhood, revealed a number of ink markings and inscriptions which were identical to markings on existing tiles preserved at T\u014ddai-ji. A more detailed &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20excavation\"&gt;archaeological excavation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the site consisted of three \"&lt;a href=\"noborigama\"&gt;noborigama&lt;/a&gt;\"-style kilns and one flat kiln. \nThe kilns were from 11.5 to 12.3 meters in length, and had a maximum width of 2.5 meters. Excavated items are now displayed at the Folklore Museum of Tahara City. The site is located a 20-minute walk from the \"Kameyama Nishi\" bus stop on the Toyotetsu Bus from the &lt;a href=\"Mikawa%20Tahara%20Station\"&gt;Mikawa Tahara Station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Toyohashi%20Railroad%20Atsumi%20Line\"&gt;Toyohashi Railroad Atsumi Line&lt;/a&gt;.
