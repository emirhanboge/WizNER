The club currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20II\"&gt;Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1912 as Vil\u00e1goss\u00e1g Football Club. At that time, &lt;a href=\"Budafok\"&gt;Budafok&lt;/a&gt; was not part of &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;; it joined the capital city only in 1950, along with other towns such as &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Ajpest\"&gt;\u00dajpest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kispest\"&gt;Kispest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBudafok mostly played in the second division of Hungarian football hierarchy, the &lt;a href=\"Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20II\"&gt;Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. However, the club got promoted and debuted in the &lt;a href=\"1945-46%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;1945\u201346&lt;/a&gt; season of the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20League\"&gt;Hungarian League&lt;/a&gt;, and finished ninth. The manager of the club in the top division was the legendary Guszt\u00e1v Sebes.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Communism%20in%20Hungary\"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;, there was a high risk that the club would be dissolved just like many other clubs in Hungary. At that time, Hungarovin, the wine-producing company financed the club. However, the company was sold to &lt;a href=\"Henkell%20%26amp%3B%20Co.%20Sektkellerei\"&gt;Henkell&lt;/a&gt; during the privatisation in Hungary. The new owner, Henkell wanted to expand its Budafok factory and wanted to use the club's football stadium too for this purpose. The club was very close to dissolution at this point. However, two sports leaders, S\u00e1ndor V\u00edzi and Rezs\u0151 Gallow started to negotiate, aiming to take the football club out of the privatisation and thus to find a way to save football in Budafok. In the end, they succeeded and the football stadium was excluded from the privatisation of the company and a new era started in the life of the club.\nIn 2015, J\u00e1nos Jakab a former Budafok player became the president of the club. Jakab, who also managed MEDOSZ Erd\u00e9rt (the former club of &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Prime Minister of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Orb%C3%A1n\"&gt;Viktor Orb\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;) and who was also president of the &lt;a href=\"Pusk%C3%A1s%20Akad%C3%A9mia%20FC\"&gt;Pusk\u00e1s Akad\u00e9mia FC&lt;/a&gt; had excellent contacts in the Hungarian football. Jakab was searching for new investors for the football club. He met R\u00f3bert B\u00e9lteky, a Hungarian-Australian entrepreneur, whom he managed to convince that it is a great opportunity to invest in the club, which then opened a new chapter in the life of Budafok. B\u00e9lteky was not new to football, he was the owner of the most popular Australian association football club, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Victory%20FC\"&gt;Melbourne Victory FC&lt;/a&gt;. When B\u00e9lteky was asked about the purchase in an interview with Nemzeti Sport, he explained: \"I wanted to purchase a club and then see it prospering\", \"I did not want to buy a club from the first league and my friend Jakab suggested Budafok\". Eventually, B\u00e9lteky purchased the 95% of the club, while the remaining 5% shares now belong to the Foundation for Budafoki Football.\nBudafok merged with &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Ajbuda%20FC\"&gt;\u00dajbuda FC&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed the club to advance from the Budapest league to the &lt;a href=\"Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20III\"&gt;Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III&lt;/a&gt;. The club started the competitions in the 2015-16 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III season. The club finished fourth in that season. After the strong start, Budafok stepped up an other level, and won the &lt;a href=\"2016-17%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20III\"&gt;2016-17 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III&lt;/a&gt; season with manager &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Prukner\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Prukner&lt;/a&gt;, while the club managed to reach the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2016-17%20Magyar%20Kupa\"&gt;2016-17 Magyar Kupa&lt;/a&gt;, where they were beaten by &lt;a href=\"Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC\"&gt;Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2017, the club signed former &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href=\"Attila%20Filkor\"&gt;Attila Filkor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 May 2017, Budafok won the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20III\"&gt;2016\u201317 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III&lt;/a&gt; season thereby gaining promotion to the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20II\"&gt;2017\u201318 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II&lt;/a&gt; season.\nOn 29 June 2017 it was announced by the club that their former player, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%B3r%C3%A1nt%20Ol%C3%A1h\"&gt;L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Ol\u00e1h&lt;/a&gt;, became the sport director.\nIn the 8th round of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Magyar%20Kupa\"&gt;2018\u201319 Magyar Kupa&lt;/a&gt; season, Budafok were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"MOL%20Vidi%20FC\"&gt;MOL Vidi FC&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2020, the club was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g\"&gt;Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2019-20%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20II\"&gt;2019-20 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II&lt;/a&gt; was interrupted and finally terminated in May. The club was the second at that time, therefore they were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"2020-21%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2020-21 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I&lt;/a&gt;.\nB\u00e9lteky, the owner of the club and resident of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, might miss the first match of the &lt;a href=\"2020-21%20Nemzeti%20Bajnoks%C3%A1g%20I\"&gt;2020-21 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I&lt;/a&gt; season due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeasons.\n\"As of 28 June 2020\""
