In May 1994, Mirage and &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Strike%20Resorts\"&gt;Gold Strike Resorts&lt;/a&gt; announced a joint venture to build a $250-million casino targeted at budget-conscious visitors, on of the Dunes site. Ground was broken for the hotel in March 1995. &lt;a href=\"Circus%20Circus%20Enterprises\"&gt;Circus Circus Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; acquired Gold Strike in June 1995 and took over its role of managing the project.\nGold Strike had hoped to name the project as the Grand Victoria, the same name as &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Victoria%20Casino%20Elgin\"&gt;the casino being developed&lt;/a&gt; by the company in Illinois, but that idea was discarded because of potential confusion with the &lt;a href=\"MGM%20Grand%20Las%20Vegas\"&gt;MGM Grand&lt;/a&gt;. \"Victoria\" and \"Victoria Bay\" were reported as likely names for the property. Details about the property were revealed in July 1995, including that it would be named the Monte Carlo and feature &lt;a href=\"Paris%20architecture%20of%20the%20Belle%20%C3%89poque\"&gt;\"Belle \u00c9poque\" architecture&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Carlo%20Casino\"&gt;Monte Carlo Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Monte Carlo opened to the public at midnight on June 21, 1996, following an invitation-only pre-opening celebration, including a fireworks show. The project ultimately cost $344 million to build.\n2008 fire.\nOn January 25, 2008, at 10:57 AM, a &lt;a href=\"three-alarm%20fire\"&gt;three-alarm fire&lt;/a&gt; was reported on the exterior of the top six floors and roof of the casino. Portions of the hotel facade's &lt;a href=\"Exterior%20Insulation%20Finishing%20System\"&gt;Exterior Insulation Finishing System&lt;/a&gt; burned with some debris falling and starting smaller secondary fires on ledges three floors below. The fire was fully contained an hour after it began. It was an exterior fire, although there was water damage to parts of several floors. The Hotel &amp; Casino reopened to guests on February 15, 2008. MGM Mirage officials put the total losses due to fire damage and loss of business at just under $100 million. Fire investigators interviewed witnesses and investigated the scene, and determined the likely cause of the fire was the improper cutting and welding operations by contractors who were installing a steel catwalk.\nPark Theater (2016-present).\nThe 5,200-seat Park Theater at the Monte Carlo was built and opened on December 17, 2016. The theater has had residencies by &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Martin\"&gt;Ricky Martin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"All%20In%20%28concert%20residency%29\"&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Cher\"&gt;Cher&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Classic%20Cher\"&gt;Classic Cher&lt;/a&gt;). The theater will be holding a 2 year residency by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gaga\"&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/a&gt; from 28 December 2018 until further notice called &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gaga%20Enigma\"&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt; as well as the first concert residency by &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Jackson\"&gt;Janet Jackson&lt;/a&gt; beginning in May 2019 titled .\nPark MGM (2018\u2013present).\nIn June 2016, MGM announced a joint venture with Sydell Group that the Monte Carlo would be renovated and rebranded as the Park MGM, named after the adjacent dining and entertainment district, The Park, that opened in April 2016, and the NoMad Hotel would occupy the top floors. It will feature the new &lt;a href=\"Eataly\"&gt;Eataly&lt;/a&gt; restaurant. Both hotels began construction at the end of 2016, with completion planned for 2018. The property was officially renamed Park MGM on May 9, 2018.\nNevada casinos were ordered to close in March 2020, due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Nevada\"&gt;its effects on the state&lt;/a&gt;. The state's casinos began reopening a few months later. When Park MGM and NoMad reopened on September 30, 2020, it instituted a non-smoking policy, becoming the only casino resort on the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Strip\"&gt;Las Vegas Strip&lt;/a&gt; to be smoke-free. This was done to attract a non-smoking clientele who dislike the cigarette smoke that is typically associated with casinos. The timing for such a decision was considered appropriate, as there was support for smoke-free policies amid the pandemic. The non-smoking policy had previously been considered two years earlier, until MGM Resorts passed on the idea. Smoking is still permitted in designated outdoor areas.\nNoMad Las Vegas.\nHotel32 was an ultra-luxury, boutique hotel located on Monte Carlo's top floor. The new extension opened on August 10, 2009. The hotel had 50 lofts ranging in size from studios to penthouses and could only be accessed via a private elevator. All Hotel32 guests had access to a dedicated Suite Assistant, who provides personal butler and concierge services and numerous high-tech touches, including a TV integrated into the bathroom mirror. Guests had access to Lounge32, which overlooks the Las Vegas skyline. Nomad Las Vegas offered its guests a branded iPhone at check-in to promote the use of hotel amenities. The system, running Hotel Evolution software, enabled the hotel to make changes to services easily, because updates were made automatically.\nIn June 2016, MGM announced a joint venture with the Sydell Group that the Hotel 32 would be renovated and rebranded as the 300-room NoMad Las Vegas.\nIn popular culture.\nMonte Carlo Resort and Casino has figured in several feature films and television series. Major release films partially filmed at Monte Carlo include the 2000 film \"&lt;a href=\"Get%20Carter%20%282000%20film%29\"&gt;Get Carter&lt;/a&gt;\" and 2008's \"&lt;a href=\"What%20Happens%20in%20Vegas\"&gt;What Happens in Vegas&lt;/a&gt;\". In the 2004 film \"\", the Average Joes stay at Monte Carlo during the &lt;a href=\"dodgeball\"&gt;dodgeball&lt;/a&gt; championships in Las Vegas. In the \"&lt;a href=\"Amazing%20Race%2015\"&gt;Amazing Race 15&lt;/a&gt;\", teams had to count out $1 million worth of poker chips here in the season finale, to receive their next clue. It was also featured in the season six episode \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20of%20a%20Kind%20%28The%20X-Files%29\"&gt;Three of a Kind&lt;/a&gt;\" of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20X-Files\"&gt;The X-Files&lt;/a&gt;.\""
