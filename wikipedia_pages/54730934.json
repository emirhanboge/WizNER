    "text": "Duke's Lodge was a six-storey &lt;a href=\"Neo-Georgian%20style%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;neo-Georgian&lt;/a&gt; 1930s apartment building on 0.6 acres at 80 Holland Park, London W11. The 35,550 sq ft building comprised 27 apartments.\nIt was built from 1937 to 1939, designed by the architect &lt;a href=\"W.%20J.%20Kieffer\"&gt;W. J. Kieffer&lt;/a&gt;, and occupied from 1942. In 1955, a roof extension with two apartments was added.\nThe building was owned by &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Victoria\"&gt;Liverpool Victoria&lt;/a&gt; (LV), who paid each of 12 long-term residents an average of \u00a31 million to buy out their &lt;a href=\"protected%20tenancy\"&gt;protected tenancy&lt;/a&gt; rights, so that all residents would be shorthold tenants who could be evicted at short notice.\nAs it is not a &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there were \"few barriers to redevelopment and even demolition\", and \"the bidding war was aggressive\".\nIn 2013, an offshore Guernsey-based subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Candy\"&gt;Christian Candy&lt;/a&gt;'s CPC Group bought Duke's Lodge, for an estimated \u00a350 million, making it \"the capital's most expensive apartment block\".\nIn March 2017, it was reported that CPC Group had received &lt;a href=\"planning%20permission\"&gt;planning permission&lt;/a&gt;, on appeal, to demolish the building and replace it with five interconnected stuccoed \"villas\" divided into 24 flats, plus a two-storey basement."
