    "text": "Neil McLennan (September 2, 1777, 1778, or 1787 \u2013 1867) was an early &lt;a href=\"Scottish-American\"&gt;Scottish-American&lt;/a&gt; settler of Texas. &lt;a href=\"McLennan%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;McLennan County, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, was named for him.\nMcLennan was born on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Skye\"&gt;Isle of Skye&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland. In 1801, he and a large group of family and friends immigrated to &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Richmond County, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, later moving further south to Florida. The McLennans were &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; speakers and &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt;s. Around 1820, they were invited by &lt;a href=\"Yuchi\"&gt;Yuchi&lt;/a&gt; Chief &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Story\"&gt;Sam Story&lt;/a&gt; to become the first &lt;a href=\"European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;white settlers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Walton%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Walton County, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. In December, 1834, Neil and his brothers Laughlin and John, along with some of their families and friends, immigrated to Texas, sailing a self-built three-masted &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Pensacola, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, to the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Brazos%20River\"&gt;Brazos River&lt;/a&gt;, where they arrived in March, 1835.\nAfter a short stay at present-day &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Columbus, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, Neil obtained a grant of a &lt;a href=\"League%20%28unit%29%23Spain\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; of land at McLennan's Bluff (a mile west of present-day &lt;a href=\"Rosebud%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rosebud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falls%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Falls County&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Robertson%27s%20Colony\"&gt;Robertson's Colony&lt;/a&gt; in July, 1835, where he and his group settled. Laughlin McLennan and his wife and mother were killed in an &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; raid the following winter, and John was likewise killed in 1838, after which the McLennan group moved to the Robertson Colony's headquarters of Nashville-on-the-Brazos in present-day &lt;a href=\"Milam%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Milam County&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1845, Neil McLennan moved his family to a site on the &lt;a href=\"Bosque%20River\"&gt;Bosque River&lt;/a&gt; near present-day &lt;a href=\"Waco%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Waco&lt;/a&gt;, and he died at his home there in 1867, renowned as \"the patriarch of the Bosque.\""
