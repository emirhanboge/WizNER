    "text": "Champs Elys\u00e9es is the second &lt;a href=\"studio%20album\"&gt;studio album&lt;/a&gt; by French DJ &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Sinclar\"&gt;Bob Sinclar&lt;/a&gt;, released in October 2000 on Yellow Productions. It reached number 28 in France and number 94 in Switzerland.\nCritical reception.\nJohn Bush of &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; wrote that with the album, Sinclar \"proved himself a solid producer despite the lack of freshness, adding in plenty of swooping strings, nickel-bag guitars, and soft-toned keyboards\", calling \"Got to Be Free\" and \"Darlin'\" \"disco-mover productions that wouldn't sound out of place on classic American R&amp;B radio\", and concluding that Sinclar \"has plenty of fun throughout the LP\". Piers Martin of \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" was considerably more negative, calling most of \"Champs Elys\u00e9es\" \"a feeble facsimile\" of the \"fabled times\" of \"New York's early-'80s club culture\" and the sound of &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;. Martin summarised the album as a \"predictable whirl of artificial strings, filtered loops and strident glitterball &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;\", judging that \"it's clear Sinclar doesn't have an original idea in his impeccably coiffured head\".\nTrack listing.\nBonus track on some CD versions\nFrench CD and digital bonus tracks"
