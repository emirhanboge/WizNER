    "text": "Sylvain Auguste de Marseul (January 21, 1812 in &lt;a href=\"Fougerolles-du-Plessis\"&gt;Fougerolles-du-Plessis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 April 16, 1890 in Paris) was a French Roman Catholic priest and &lt;a href=\"entomologist\"&gt;entomologist&lt;/a&gt;. He taught in the Petit s\u00e9minaire de Paris from 1833 to 1836. In 1842, founded a college at &lt;a href=\"Laval%2C%20Mayenne\"&gt;Laval&lt;/a&gt;, then from 1850 to 1853, he taught in Paris. In 1854, he left his college for America where he remained eight months and discovered entomology. The abbot of Marseul was the author of many publications. He founded in 1864 a review devoted to the &lt;a href=\"Coleoptera\"&gt;Coleoptera&lt;/a&gt; and named \"L'Abeille\", the Bee. On his death this publication was continued by &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Marie%20Louis%20Bedel\"&gt;Ernest Marie Louis Bedel&lt;/a&gt; (1849-1922) then by &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Jeannel\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Gabriel Jeannel&lt;/a&gt; (1879-1965). The abbot also studied the history of the beginnings of French entomology in a series of review article in the Bee under the generic title \"Entomologistes et de leurs \u00e9crits\", Entomologists and their writings (1882 to 1887). His collection is conserved in the &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27histoire%20naturelle\"&gt;Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle&lt;/a&gt; and his library in the &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20entomologique%20de%20France\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entomologique de France&lt;/a&gt;.\nSources.\nTranslated from the French Wikipedia article."
