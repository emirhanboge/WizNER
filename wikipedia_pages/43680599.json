SA and owned by Massimo Silvestri.\nParent company: ISSEA.\nI.S.S.E.A. SA, \"Istituto superiore di scienze economiche e aziendali\" (Higher institute of economics and management), claims to operate on the basis of the &lt;a href=\"economic%20freedom\"&gt;economic freedom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scientific%20freedom\"&gt;scientific freedom&lt;/a&gt; guaranteed in &lt;a href=\"Title%202%20of%20the%20Swiss%20Federal%20Constitution\"&gt;Title 2 of the Swiss Federal Constitution&lt;/a&gt; (art. 27 and art. 20), but it is &lt;a href=\"educational%20accreditation\"&gt;not accredited&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20University%20Conference%23Accreditation%20role\"&gt;Rectors' Conference of the Swiss Universities (CRUS)&lt;/a&gt;. It was established in 1987, offering unaccredited degrees through its \"Politecnico di studi aziendali, Unipsa\" (Polytechnic University of Business Studies, Unipsa) in &lt;a href=\"Lugano\"&gt;Lugano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agno%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Agno&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being based in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, with an alleged branch in &lt;a href=\"San%20Marino\"&gt;San Marino&lt;/a&gt;, the organization has Italian landlines and the owner only speaks Italian because the degrees are offered to &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; from Switzerland, as unaccredited universities are illegal in Italy.\nAlthough the director/founder/owner Massimo Silvestri (also going by Massimo Maria Pietro) is not a current member of the &lt;a href=\"Admission%20to%20practice%20law%23Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss Bar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Admission%20to%20practice%20law%23Italy\"&gt;Italian Bar&lt;/a&gt;, he introduces himself as an &lt;a href=\"Lawyer\"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt;, using the Italian \"avv.\" title.\nDegrees.\nThe organization has no campus, no professors and no staff, and issues degrees based on life experiences and optional online learning courses, namely &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;Bachelor's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20degree\"&gt;Master's&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Philosophy\"&gt;Doctoral degrees&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegal disputes.\nISSEA and the Politecnico di studi aziendali of &lt;a href=\"Lugano\"&gt;Lugano&lt;/a&gt; were also not accredited by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports of &lt;a href=\"Ticino\"&gt;Ticino&lt;/a&gt;. ISSEA SA has been denied accreditation by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Administrative%20Court%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, too. The same federal court permanently banned ISSEA and its Politecnico di studi aziendali from the European &lt;a href=\"Erasmus%20Programme\"&gt;Erasmus Programme&lt;/a&gt; because of their unaccredited status. Since January 1, 2015, the usage of the words \"polytechnic\" and/or \"university\" by unaccredited institutions has been declared illegal by the Canton of Ticino, which is why the Politecnico di Studi Aziendali and ISSEA had to leave Ticino and moved to &lt;a href=\"Roveredo\"&gt;Roveredo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Ministry%20of%20Education\"&gt;Italian Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; included the Politecnico di studi aziendali in a list of private institutions which are not allowed to issue valid academic qualifications.\nIn 2007, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Competition%20Authority\"&gt;Italian Competition Authority&lt;/a&gt; convicted ISSEA and Massimo Silvestri &lt;a href=\"in%20absentia\"&gt;in absentia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"deceptive%20advertising\"&gt;deceptive advertising&lt;/a&gt;. \nISSEA used to be a member of the general assembly of &lt;a href=\"EMUNI%20University\"&gt;EMUNI University&lt;/a&gt; so it could receive European public funds, such as \u20ac50,000 in 2012 through &lt;a href=\"Istituto%20nazionale%20della%20previdenza%20sociale\"&gt;INPDAP&lt;/a&gt;, although Switzerland is not in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Grisons\"&gt;Canton of Grisons&lt;/a&gt;' parliament asked to stop the company from operating even in the new location of Roveredo. A few months later, the unaccredited school moved to the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Zug\"&gt;Canton of Zug&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the same year, in the tribunal of the Canton of Ticino, the company was convicted of unauthorized use of protected names (\"university\", \"polytechnic\" etc.).\nIn 2018, a final ruling of the Italian &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20State%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Council of State&lt;/a&gt; held that ISSEA SA and all its alleged universities are not recognized in Italy or in Switzerland and their degrees have no value. ISSEA had taken a legal action against the Ministry for University Instruction and Research and against the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Ministry of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, which would not let ISSEA create an Italian branch \u2014 called \"ISSEA Campus Italia\" \u2014 of the alleged Swiss university. The court stated that ISSEA is not allowed to purport to be an academic institution.\nIn 2021, a &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Neapolitan&lt;/a&gt; court found out that a student who was going to receive a Master's degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Naples%20Federico%20II\"&gt;University of Naples Federico II&lt;/a&gt; had a Bachelor's degree issued by one of ISSEA's institutions: since the Bachelor's degree was invalid, the court revoked his graduate and undergraduate careers and stopped him from defending his thesis.\nOther names.\nAfter the Swiss authorities declared the name \"Politecnico di studi aziendali\" illegal, the institution's &lt;a href=\"Advertising\"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt;s started to use different names as well, such as \"Polotecnico di studi aziendali\" (only one vowel was changed) or \"Polo Tecnico di studi aziendali\" (literally: Technical research center of business studies, www.unipsa.net and www.uni-psa.ch), \"Unipsa\", \"I.S.S.E.A. sa Scuola Universitaria Privata a Distanza\", \"C.I.S.M.A.D.\" (Centro Italiano Studi Multidisciplinari a Distanza, www.cismad.it, currently inactive), \"unisupdi.ch\"/\"unipfh.ch\" or \"SUPDI\"\u2014not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"SUPSI\"&gt;SUPSI&lt;/a&gt;, an accredited Swiss university (only one letter has been changed).\nAn old website called \"Private University Consortium\" (www.umc-puc.edu), created in 1999 and deactivated in 2006, also sold degrees from &lt;a href=\"Gibraltar\"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; under the name of \"Universit\u00e0 Mons Calpe\", from &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; under the name of \"American Business School LLC\", and from &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; under the name of \"University Europanamense\". The &lt;a href=\"consortium\"&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be headquartered in the same office as the Politecnico di studi aziendali in Ticino. All the institutions were unaccredited and all the offices no longer exist.\nUnivolta Universit\u00e0 Telematica Privata Alessandro Volta.\nAs of 2017, the institution is also being advertised as \"Univolta Universit\u00e0 Telematica Privata Alessandro Volta\" (Online Private University &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Volta\"&gt;Alessandro Volta&lt;/a&gt;, www.univolta.ch), using the same address and/or &lt;a href=\"P.O.%20box\"&gt;P.O. box&lt;/a&gt; in Zug and the same &lt;a href=\"domain%20name\"&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; as the Politecnico di Studi Aziendali (www.unipsa.ch)\u2014whose name has been declared illegal by Swiss authorities\u2014as well as \"Atena Unitelematica scuola universitaria www.uniatena.ch\" (Telematic university &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Hochschule &lt;a href=\"Nikola%20Tesla\"&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/a&gt; www.unitesla.ch\" (Nikola Tesla University). The website www.unipsa.net, which was used by the aforementioned \"Polo Tecnico di studi aziendali\", now &lt;a href=\"URL%20redirection\"&gt;redirects&lt;/a&gt; to Supdi.\nUniSupdi or Supdi.\nAs of 2018, ISSEA also uses the name \"I.S.S.E.A. sa SUPDI Scuola Universitaria Privata a Distanza PFH Private Fernhochschule\" (or \"Hochschule\"), with alleged &lt;a href=\"registered%20office\"&gt;registered office&lt;/a&gt; in Baarerstrasse 82 6300 Zug, and websites unisupdi.ch/unipfh.ch.
