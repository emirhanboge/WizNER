    "text": "A Super cup is a competition, usually but not exclusively in &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt;, which often forms the \u2019&lt;a href=\"Curtain%20raiser%20%28drama%29\"&gt;curtain-raiser&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 to a season. It is typically contested on a national level by two competition winners of the previous season: the knock-out cup winner and the league winner. There are also continental super cups, like the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; in football, which puts together winners of the top- and second-tier UEFA competitions. Sometimes these are &lt;a href=\"two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged tie&lt;/a&gt;s, with a match played at each side's stadium, but increasingly they are one-off fixtures at a neutral venue, such as a &lt;a href=\"national%20stadium\"&gt;national stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Some Super Cups have even been staged in venues outside their home country, such as the Italian, French, Spanish, Turkish, Mexican, and Egyptian games. \nIf the league champions are &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;also the national cup winners&lt;/a&gt;, they may play the runners-up from one of the competitions.\nFootball.\nNational super cups.\nThe following nations have an active super cup competition:\nContinental super cups.\nSome continental football federations also have their own super cups:\nIntercontinental super cups.\nMost of the continental football confederations have jointly held a competition pitting their champions against each other: \nAll of these competitions are now defunct and have been succeeded by the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which features the champions of all of the confederations, plus the champion of the host country. In 2017, FIFA retroactively recognised the winners of the European/South American Cup as world champions.\nA similar tournament was held at international level, the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially held on a biennial basis, every odd year, from 1993 until 2005 when it became quadrennial, the year before a &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in its host country. It featured the six continental champions, the World Cup winners and the host. The &lt;a href=\"2017%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2017 FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; was the 10th and last Confederations Cup before FIFA abolished it for an &lt;a href=\"Future%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20%28China%29\"&gt;expanded Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther tournaments like this have been held, including the &lt;a href=\"Suruga%20Bank%20Championship\"&gt;Suruga Bank Championship&lt;/a&gt; (pitting the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Sudamericana\"&gt;Copa Sudamericana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.League%20Cup\"&gt;J.League Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners), the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20de%20Oro\"&gt;Copa de Oro&lt;/a&gt; (pitting all the most recent CONMEBOL competition winners), and the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Iberoamericana\"&gt;Copa Iberoamericana&lt;/a&gt; (pitting the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20de%20Oro\"&gt;Copa de Oro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; winners."
