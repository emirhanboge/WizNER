The tournament was played at the &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Center\"&gt;Patriot Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fairfax, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; during May 1990. \n&lt;a href=\"USC%20Trojans%20men%27s%20volleyball\"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Long%20Beach%20State%2049ers%20men%27s%20volleyball\"&gt;Long Beach State&lt;/a&gt; in the final match, 3\u20131 (15\u201310, 12\u201315, 15\u20134, 15\u20136), to win their fourth national title. The Trojans (26\u20137) were coached by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20McLaughlin%20%28coach%29\"&gt;Jim McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt;.\nUSC's &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Ivie\"&gt;Bryan Ivie&lt;/a&gt; was named the tournament's \"Most Outstanding Player\". Ivie, along with five other players, comprised the \"All-Tournament Team\".\nQualification.\nUntil the creation of the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20III%20Volleyball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all &lt;a href=\"NCAA\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; men's volleyball programs, whether from &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20II\"&gt;Division II&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20III\"&gt;Division III&lt;/a&gt;, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship."
