    "text": "The Rondevlei Nature Reserve is located in &lt;a href=\"Grassy%20Park\"&gt;Grassy Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeekoevlei\"&gt;Zeekoevlei&lt;/a&gt; and Lavenderhill, &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburbs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; covers approximately of mostly permanent &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Lowland%20Freshwater%20Wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt; and consists of a single large &lt;a href=\"brackish\"&gt;brackish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt; is among the most important wetlands for birds in South Africa despite being situated directly alongside the &lt;a href=\"Zeekoevlei\"&gt;Zeekoevlei&lt;/a&gt;. A number of islands on the vlei act as vital &lt;a href=\"Mating\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; sites. Rondevlei is home to about 230 bird &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of small mammals and reptiles like &lt;a href=\"caracal\"&gt;caracal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"porcupine\"&gt;porcupine&lt;/a&gt;, Cape &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;, grysbuck, steenbuck and &lt;a href=\"mongoose\"&gt;mongoose&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"hippopotamus\"&gt;hippopotamus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; which was re-introduced in 1981 as a means to control an &lt;a href=\"Alien%20%28biology%29\"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; species from &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, which had covered the &lt;a href=\"shoreline\"&gt;shoreline&lt;/a&gt; and was threatening to engulf the vlei itself. It boasts unusual and threatened &lt;a href=\"ecosystems\"&gt;ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Flats%20Dune%20Strandveld\"&gt;strandveld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Flats%20Sand%20Fynbos\"&gt;sand plains fynbos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Lowland%20Freshwater%20Wetland\"&gt;Cape lowland wetland vegetation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endemic%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; coastal fynbos &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; with unique plants found nowhere else in the world.\nIn February 2004, a young hippo named Hugo or Houdini escaped from Rondevlei after it was &lt;a href=\"bullied\"&gt;bullied&lt;/a&gt; by an older &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20hierarchy\"&gt;dominant&lt;/a&gt; male and was on the run for 10 months until it was caught in December and moved to an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Cape\"&gt;Eastern Cape&lt;/a&gt; private reserve.\nHistory.\nThe reserve was established in 1952 in cooperation with the Cape Divisional Council (now Cape Metropolitan Council), when the area was still used by locals to graze &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, for woodcutting and flower picking. Originally it consisted of the vlei and about of land, which was extended in 1963 and 1987 by adding &lt;a href=\"dunes\"&gt;dunes&lt;/a&gt; and seasonal wetlands to the south of the vlei to the reserve. To prevent &lt;a href=\"flooding\"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt; of the built-up areas, which contained then mainly sub-economic housing, a &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt; at the south-eastern end of the vlei was built to permanently lower the level of Rondevlei. The management of the reserve was taken over by the South Peninsula &lt;a href=\"Municipality\"&gt;Municipality&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and it is now part of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Cape%20Town\"&gt;City of Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacilities.\nThe facilities in the reserve include an about long waterside &lt;a href=\"trail\"&gt;trail&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"shoreline\"&gt;shoreline&lt;/a&gt; with six bird hides and two large wooden observation towers, a &lt;a href=\"terrarium\"&gt;terrarium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Leonard Gill museum and an &lt;a href=\"Environmentalism\"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; education centre with lecture theater and resource centre.\nBesides &lt;a href=\"birdwatching\"&gt;birdwatching&lt;/a&gt; visitors are offered guided tours, boat cruises, conference facilities and secluded overnight accommodation within the reserve which are organized by a community-based company, Imvubu Nature Tours, which was established in 2002 with the use of poverty relief funds, made available by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism."
