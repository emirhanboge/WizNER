    "text": "Luka Svetec (8 October 1826 \u2013 28 January 1921) was a &lt;a href=\"Slovenes\"&gt;Slovene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"philologist\"&gt;philologist&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1870s and 1880s, Svetec was one of the most influential leaders of the so-called &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slovenes\"&gt;Old Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"national%20conservative\"&gt;national conservative&lt;/a&gt; political group in 19th century &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Lands\"&gt;Slovene Lands&lt;/a&gt;. He was renowned as an honest and principled politician, and was praised for his decency and his straightforward, practical attitude to political questions and life in general. The Old Slovene leader &lt;a href=\"Janez%20Bleiweis\"&gt;Janez Bleiweis&lt;/a&gt; called him \"a crystallized Slovene common sense\". Because of his failure to take over the political leadership of the party after the death of its leader Janez Bleiweis, also called &lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Nation\"&gt;Father of the Nation&lt;/a&gt;, Svetec was mockingly referred in the press to as \"Stepfather of the Nation\".\nLife and career.\nSvetec was born in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Carniola\"&gt;Upper Carniola&lt;/a&gt;n village of &lt;a href=\"Podgorje%2C%20Kamnik\"&gt;Podgorje&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kamnik\"&gt;Kamnik&lt;/a&gt;, in what was then the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austrian Empire&lt;/a&gt; (now in &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;). After finishing the grammar school in &lt;a href=\"Ljubljana\"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;, he enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;. After graduation in 1853, he worked in the Austrian administration in &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. After 1861, he returned to his native &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;, at first as a senior official in the Austrian judicial administration in &lt;a href=\"Mokronog-Trebelno\"&gt;Mokronog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ko%C4%8Devje\"&gt;Ko\u010devje&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently as a district judge in &lt;a href=\"Brdo%20pri%20Lukovici\"&gt;Brdo&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1866 and 1871, he worked in the municipal administration in Ljubljana, and later as a &lt;a href=\"civil%20law%20notary\"&gt;civil law notary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Idrija\"&gt;Idrija&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Litija\"&gt;Litija&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe participated in the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20national%20movement\"&gt;Slovene national movement&lt;/a&gt; since 1848. He was very active in the discussions on the creation of a &lt;a href=\"standard%20language\"&gt;literary standard&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20language\"&gt;Slovene language&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the most vocal defendants of Slovene linguistic and national individuality against &lt;a href=\"pan-Slavism\"&gt;pan-Slavism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt;ism. He entered active politics in 1862, when he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"provincial%20diet\"&gt;provincial diet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Carniola\"&gt;Carniola&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1870s, especially after the death of &lt;a href=\"Lovro%20Toman\"&gt;Lovro Toman&lt;/a&gt;, he emerged as one of the most influential leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slovene\"&gt;Old Slovene&lt;/a&gt; political movement. Against the pragmatism of most of its leaders, Svetec called for an intransigent political action, thus frequently siding with the radical &lt;a href=\"Young%20Slovenes\"&gt;Young Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his life, he defended the idea of &lt;a href=\"United%20Slovenia\"&gt;United Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. He opposed national demands based on historical state rights, and firmly supported the idea of &lt;a href=\"natural%20right\"&gt;natural right&lt;/a&gt; of peoples.\nAfter 1881, he was designated as the successor of &lt;a href=\"Janez%20Bleiweis\"&gt;Janez Bleiweis&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Old Slovene movement. However, his leadership was rejected by the more conservative factions in the movement. After the mid-1880s, Svetec grew closer to the Slovene &lt;a href=\"liberal%20nationalist\"&gt;liberal nationalist&lt;/a&gt;s, and finally joined the &lt;a href=\"National%20Progressive%20Party%20%28Slovenia%29\"&gt;National Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe died at the age of 94 in &lt;a href=\"Litija\"&gt;Litija&lt;/a&gt;."
