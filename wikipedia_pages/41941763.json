    "text": "Basque cider is an &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cider\"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; region of Europe served at &lt;a href=\"sagardotegi\"&gt;sagardotegi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"cider%20house\"&gt;cider house&lt;/a&gt;s). Known as Sagardoa, the &lt;a href=\"cider\"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Basque%20cuisine\"&gt;Basque cuisine&lt;/a&gt; is produced at &lt;a href=\"cider%20house\"&gt;cider house&lt;/a&gt;s in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Astigarraga\"&gt;Astigarraga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; growing region. It is sold in bottles, is flat (non-carbonated), and poured from height. Salted cod omelette is a traditional dish eaten in Basque cider houses. Quince jelly and nuts are also served as well as steak.\nThe production of the Basque cider is similar to &lt;a href=\"winemaking\"&gt;winemaking&lt;/a&gt; in many ways. Apple harvesting starts in September and October to prepare raw material for barrel fermentation. The cider is then fermented up to the middle of spring. Compared to natural winemaking, Basque cider manufacturers do not add any commercial yeast. Spontaneous fermentation is the preferred way to produce cider in the Basque region."
