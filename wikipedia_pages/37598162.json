    "text": "Ivan Ivanovich Yanzhul (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u042f\u043d\u0436\u0443\u043b; 1846\u20131914) was a professor of &lt;a href=\"financial%20law\"&gt;financial law&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20University\"&gt;Moscow University&lt;/a&gt; who established the Russian state &lt;a href=\"factory%20inspection\"&gt;factory inspection&lt;/a&gt;. He helped enforce the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20law%20in%20the%20Russian%20Empire\"&gt;first Russian labour code&lt;/a&gt; (1 June 1882) which provided a measure of protection for Russian factory workers. His job involved finding an industrial enterprise, gaining access to the premises and forcing the owner to halt illegal practices such as night &lt;a href=\"child%20labor\"&gt;child labor&lt;/a&gt;. His political views have been described as &lt;a href=\"state%20socialism\"&gt;state socialism&lt;/a&gt; in that he advocated that government manipulation of tax and customs policy was sufficient for the realisation of socialism. Yanzhul was elected into the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Russian Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1895. His &lt;a href=\"memoirs\"&gt;memoirs&lt;/a&gt; were published in 2 volumes in 1910 and 1911."
