    "text": "Myrtaceae or the myrtle family is a family of &lt;a href=\"dicotyledon\"&gt;dicotyledon&lt;/a&gt;ous &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s placed within the order &lt;a href=\"Myrtales\"&gt;Myrtales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Myrtus\"&gt;Myrtle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Metrosideros\"&gt;p\u014dhutukawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pimenta%20racemosa\"&gt;bay rum tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clove\"&gt;clove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guava\"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acca%20%28plant%29\"&gt;acca (feijoa)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allspice\"&gt;allspice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"eucalyptus\"&gt;eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt; are some notable members of this group. All species are woody, contain &lt;a href=\"essential%20oil\"&gt;essential oil&lt;/a&gt;s, and have flower parts in multiples of four or five. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"evergreen\"&gt;evergreen&lt;/a&gt;, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually entire (i.e., without a toothed margin). The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous.\nEvolutionary history.\nScientists hypothesize that the family Myrtaceae arose between sixty and fifty-six million years ago during the &lt;a href=\"Paleocene\"&gt;Paleocene&lt;/a&gt; era. Pollen fossils have been sourced to the ancient supercontinent &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt;. The breakup of &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; period (145 to 66 Mya) geographically isolated disjunct taxa and allowed for rapid speciation: in particular, genera once considered members of the now-defunct Leptospermoideae alliance are now isolated within &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, experts agree that &lt;a href=\"Allopatric%20speciation\"&gt;vicariance&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the differentiation of Myrtaceae taxa, except in the cases of \"&lt;a href=\"Leptospermum\"&gt;Leptospermum&lt;/a&gt;\" species now located on &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Caledonia\"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt;, islands which may have been submerged at the time of late &lt;a href=\"Eocene\"&gt;Eocene&lt;/a&gt; differentiation.\nDiversity.\nRecent estimates suggest the Myrtaceae include approximately 5,950 species in about 132 genera. The family has a wide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate regions of the world, and is common in many of the world's &lt;a href=\"biodiversity%20hotspot\"&gt;biodiversity hotspot&lt;/a&gt;s. Genera with &lt;a href=\"Capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsular&lt;/a&gt; fruits such as \"&lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus\"&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Corymbia\"&gt;Corymbia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Angophora\"&gt;Angophora&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Leptospermum\"&gt;Leptospermum&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Melaleuca\"&gt;Melaleuca&lt;/a&gt;\" are absent from the Americas, apart from \"&lt;a href=\"Metrosideros\"&gt;Metrosideros&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. Genera with fleshy fruits have their greatest concentrations in eastern &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malesia\"&gt;Malesia&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Australasian%20realm\"&gt;Australasian realm&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Neotropic\"&gt;Neotropic&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Eucalyptus\" is a dominant, nearly ubiquitous genus in the more mesic parts of Australia and extends north sporadically to the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus%20regnans\"&gt;Eucalyptus regnans&lt;/a&gt;\" is the tallest flowering plant in the world. Other important Australian genera are \"&lt;a href=\"Callistemon\"&gt;Callistemon&lt;/a&gt;\" (bottlebrushes), \"&lt;a href=\"Syzygium\"&gt;Syzygium&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Melaleuca\"&gt;Melaleuca&lt;/a&gt;\" (paperbarks). Species of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Osbornia\"&gt;Osbornia&lt;/a&gt;\", native to Australasia, are &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt;s. \"&lt;a href=\"Eugenia\"&gt;Eugenia&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Myrcia\"&gt;Myrcia&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Calyptranthes\"&gt;Calyptranthes&lt;/a&gt;\" are among the larger genera in the neotropics.\nHistorically, the Myrtaceae were divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily Myrtoideae (about 75 genera) was recognized as having fleshy fruits and opposite, entire leaves. Most genera in this subfamily have one of three easily recognized types of embryos. The genera of Myrtoideae can be very difficult to distinguish in the absence of mature fruits. Myrtoideae are found worldwide in subtropical and tropical regions, with centers of diversity in the Neotropics, northeastern Australia, and Malesia. In contrast, subfamily Leptospermoideae (about 80 genera) was recognized as having dry, dehiscent fruits (capsules) and leaves arranged spirally or alternate. The Leptospermoideae are found mostly in Australasia, with a centre of diversity in Australia. Many genera in Western Australia have greatly reduced leaves and flowers typical of more xeric habitats.\nTaxonomy.\nThe division of Myrtaceae into Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae was challenged by a number of authors, including Johnson and Briggs (1984), who identified 14 tribes or clades within Myrtaceae, and found Myrtoideae to be polyphyletic. Molecular studies by several groups of authors, as of 2008, have confirmed the baccate (fleshy) fruits evolved twice from capsular fruits and, as such, the two-subfamily classification does not accurately portray the phylogenetic history of the family. Thus, many workers are now using a recent analysis by Wilson et al. (2001) as a starting point for further analyses of the family. This study pronounced both Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae invalid, but retained several smaller suballiances shown to be monophyletic through matK analysis.\nThe genera \"&lt;a href=\"Heteropyxis\"&gt;Heteropyxis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Psiloxylon\"&gt;Psiloxylon&lt;/a&gt;\" have been separated as separate families by many authors in the past as Heteropyxidaceae and Psiloxylaceae. However, Wilson \"et al.\" included them in Myrtaceae. These two genera are presently believed to be the earliest arising and surviving lineages of Myrtaceae.\nThe most recent classification recognizes 17 tribes and two subfamilies, Myrtoideae and Psiloxyloideae, based on a phylogenetic analysis of &lt;a href=\"plastid\"&gt;plastid&lt;/a&gt; DNA.\nMany new species are being described annually from throughout the range of Myrtaceae. Likewise, new genera are being described nearly yearly.\nClassification.\nFollowing Wilson (2011)\nSubfamily &lt;a href=\"Psiloxyloideae\"&gt;Psiloxyloideae&lt;/a&gt;\nSubfamily &lt;a href=\"Myrtoideae\"&gt;Myrtoideae&lt;/a&gt;\nForaging.\nMyrtaceae is foraged by many stingless bees, especially by the species \"&lt;a href=\"Melipona%20bicolor\"&gt;Melipona bicolor&lt;/a&gt;\" which gather pollen from this plant family."
