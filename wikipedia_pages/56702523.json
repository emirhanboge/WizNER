Calk is a nationally recognized expert in the fields of &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;, and real estate finance as well as &lt;a href=\"National%20security\"&gt;National Security&lt;/a&gt; and Military issues.\nCalk's banking career began in 1995 when he founded Chicago Bancorp, which has been described as \"one of the largest privately-held retail mortgage banks in the country\u201d and served as its president until it was later absorbed into The Federal Savings Bank, where, with his brother John, he focused on issuing &lt;a href=\"mortgage%20loan\"&gt;mortgage loan&lt;/a&gt;s on single-family homes to veterans.\nIn 2014, Calk moved his bank's headquarters to &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; after the city offered him tax breaks. Calk struck an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Chicago Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahm%20Emanuel\"&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; that promised to bring up to 400 new employees to a gentrifying neighborhood west of downtown. The city agreed to pay the bank $10,000 per employee, in what was the largest-ever grant of its kind, to cover job training costs. In the end, Calk and his brother John pulled off a neat trick: Their bank, among the most profitable in the country that year, collected $3.6 million in public subsidies in substantial part by hiring employees. The city and the bank said in written responses to questions that Federal Savings fulfilled all of its obligations and that the funds were only paid after the job training was completed and verified. A multimillion-dollar deal between &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Chicago Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahm%20Emanuel\"&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; and Stephen Calk was supposed to deliver 400 new jobs to the city. On April 23, 2012, Stephen Calk said in an email to a city official that Federal Savings Bank's board of directors had approved plans to establish a national home loan center in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, subject to receiving a training allowance of $10,000 per employee. Under the deal, Chicago's financial commitment was to come from a portion of the city's TIF program that is dedicated to job training. Between early 2012 and March 28, 2013, the city of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; awarded two TIFWorks contracts totaling $2.1 million to Federal Savings and its holding company, according to city records. In 2015, the city awarded another $1.5 million to the holding company, bringing the total to $3.6 million. However, a &lt;a href=\"Spokesperson\"&gt;spokesman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; Department of Planning and Development told that the city was aware that the bank's training would cover both incumbent and new employees. The program's guidelines state that the funds can be used both to train new hires and to provide training that upgrades the skills of current employees. The Federal Savings Bank, which specializes in home loans for veterans and first-time homebuyers, has 1722 &lt;a href=\"Employment\"&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2016/2017 Calk served as a Senior Economic Advisor to the &lt;a href=\"President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President-Elect of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and he has served as an advisor to the Governor of the &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;State of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, the Commissioner of Banks. and Real Estate and the Office of Professional Regulation for the &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;State of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; on matters of Mortgage Banking and Real Estate finance. Calk had been named to the &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump%202016%20presidential%20campaign\"&gt;Trump campaign&lt;/a&gt;'s economic advisory panel in August 2016. Calk was nominated by &lt;a href=\"Congressman\"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Crane\"&gt;Phillip Crane&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently appointed to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School at West Point.\nIn 2016, he was an &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20economic%20advisors%20to%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;economic advisor to Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2016%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2016 United States presidential election campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Calk calls himself a centrist who backed President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. He says he's only met &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; three or four times, at social or charitable events. \u201cHe seemed to take a real interest in the fact that I was a single dad, that I was a family man, that I built my business, and I think he had a lot of respect for that,\u201d Calk says. Calk has respect for &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Trump's&lt;/a&gt; economic plans, especially cutting child-care costs and cutting business taxes to 15 percent. \u201cHe wants to see America on top, and I think the way he will deliver that message will probably be in a very measured way,\u201d he says. Trump's economic team is totally composed of white men \u2014 no women, no minorities. Calk said this is only the initial group. He expects more diversity when additional advisers are added.\nIn 2017 Calk was named EY Entrepreneur of the Year finalist, Midwest division. He has served on the &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20directors\"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt;, advisory board of directors, or customer advisory board of directors for various public and private companies, including &lt;a href=\"JPMorgan%20Chase\"&gt;JP Morgan Chase&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Ohio Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Citigroup\"&gt;Citimortgage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20America\"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;, and the former &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt; Mortgage Insurance Company. He is regularly featured in print and on-air national news programs, including &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MSNBC\"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Business%20News\"&gt;Fox Business News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CNBC\"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; Squawk Box, &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; evening news, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reuters\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, Money, Crain's Chicago Business, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Tribune\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Sun-Times\"&gt;Chicago Sun Times&lt;/a&gt;.

Before, in 1995 Stephen established and served as &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago Bancorp, which has grown to be one of Illinois\u2019 largest privately held retail mortgage banks.\nIn 2014, Calk struck an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Chicago Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahm%20Emanuel\"&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; that promised to bring up to 400 new employees to a gentrifying neighborhood west of downtown.

Lorber, a longtime friend, and ally of Trump's, later served with Calk on the Trump campaign's economic council.\nIn 2015, the city awarded another $1.5 million to the holding company, bringing the total to $3.6 million. However, a &lt;a href=\"Spokesperson\"&gt;spokesman&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; Department of Planning and Development told that the city was aware that the bank's training would cover both incumbent and new employees.

The Federal Savings Bank, which specializes in home loans for veterans and first-time homebuyers, has 1722 employees.\nIn 2019, Calk resigned as chairman and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago.\nLoans to Paul Manafort.\nManafort first got in touch with Calk's Federal Savings Bank of Chicago in April 2016, according to testimony given by the bank's senior vice president Dennis Raico at Manafort's August 2018 trial for fraud and tax evasion. Manafort, Calk, and Raico discussed loans and politics over dinner in New York in May 2016. On July 28, Calk became directly involved in discussions about loans to Manafort and his son-in-law for investment properties, which Raico told the court was unusual. Subsequently, over a lunch, Calk and Manafort discussed another loan. On October 6, 2016, Manafort emailed Calk to say that he had been mistaken in saying at this lunch that he owed $2.5 million on a Bridgehampton, New York, property that he intended to use as collateral. In fact he owed $3 million. \"I must have had a blackout,\" Manafort wrote in his email. On October 16, Manafort asked to change the terms of the loan, requesting a line of credit on the property instead of using it as collateral for a construction loan for a California property. In his application materials for the loan, Manafort provided a 2016 income statement for himself that his business partner Rick Gates later testified was false. \nJames Brennan, another vice president at the bank, testified at Manafort's trial that Manafort failed to declare in his application materials that two of his New York properties were already mortgaged and that Manafort's statements about his income in 2015 were inconsistent. Brennan also testified that bank employees had noticed that Manafort seemed to have no income as of July 2016, though he claimed to be owed $2.4 million, that he was more than 90 days late on a $300,000 credit card bill. Concerns within the bank about the propriety of the loan were overruled by Calk, however, and on November 16, 2016, Manafort received from Calk's bank a $9.5 million cash-out refinance loan on a house in Bridgehampton, New York. \"It closed because Mr. Calk wanted it to close,\" Brennan testified. On January 4, 2017, Manafort received an additional loan from Calk's bank, a $6.5 million construction loan on a property on Union Street in New York City. The two loans, totalling about $16 million, were the largest and second-largest ever issued by the bank. The combined size of the loans at the time represented around 5 percent of the bank's asset base of $341 million, and represented about 22 percent of the bank's equity capital of $72 million.\nThe bank has since written the loans off as a loss."
