    "text": "Wakanda () is a fictional country in &lt;a href=\"East%20Africa\"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in &lt;a href=\"sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and is home to the superhero &lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;. Wakanda first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Fantastic%20Four%20%28comic%20book%29\"&gt;Fantastic Four&lt;/a&gt;\" #52 (July 1966), and was created by &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Lee\"&gt;Stan Lee&lt;/a&gt;. \nWakanda has appeared in comics and various media adaptations, such as in the &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe\"&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;, where it is depicted as the most technologically advanced nation on the planet.\nLocation.\nSome sources place Wakanda just north of &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; and exactly at &lt;a href=\"Rwanda\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, while others such as \"Marvel Atlas\" #2 show it at the north end of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Turkana\"&gt;Lake Turkana&lt;/a&gt;, in between &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; (and surrounded by fictional countries like Azania, Canaan, and Narobia). \nDirector &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Coogler\"&gt;Ryan Coogler&lt;/a&gt; stated that his depiction of Wakanda in the 2018 film \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther%20%28film%29\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;\" was inspired by the Southern African &lt;a href=\"Lesotho\"&gt;Kingdom of Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn recent stories by writer &lt;a href=\"Ta-Nehisi%20Coates\"&gt;Ta-Nehisi Coates&lt;/a&gt;, Wakanda is located on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Victoria\"&gt;Lake Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, near fellow fictional nations Mohannda, Canaan, Azania, and Niganda. This places these nations mostly in what in real life is the eastern half of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBirnin Zana is located within Wakanda. It is considered by some to be a &lt;a href=\"smart%20city\"&gt;smart city&lt;/a&gt;. In Birnin Zana, pedestrians walk along commerce-filled streets that are car-free except for the occasional appearance of (buslike) &lt;a href=\"Share%20taxi\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt;s. The whole is quite similar to the &lt;a href=\"woonerf\"&gt;woonerf&lt;/a&gt; concept, an approach to public space design which started in the Netherlands in the 1970s. &lt;a href=\"Maglev%20train\"&gt;Maglev train&lt;/a&gt;s are seen zipping above and around the city. The Wakandan buildings incorporate some traditional African elements (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Thatching\"&gt;thatched roofs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hanging%20garden\"&gt;hanging garden&lt;/a&gt;s) on some of the tallest structures.\nHistory.\nBefore the emergence of the Wakandan nation, mystic beings known as Originators were expelled from the region by the humans and the Orisha, the pantheon of Wakanda consisting of &lt;a href=\"Thoth\"&gt;Thoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ptah\"&gt;Ptah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mujaji\"&gt;Mujaji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kokou%20%28orisha%29\"&gt;Kokou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bastet\"&gt;Bast&lt;/a&gt;, the Panther Goddess.\nIn the distant past, a massive &lt;a href=\"meteorite\"&gt;meteorite&lt;/a&gt; made up of the element &lt;a href=\"vibranium\"&gt;vibranium&lt;/a&gt; crashed in Wakanda. The meteorite was named Mena Ngai. It was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. T'Challa, the current Black Panther, is the son of T'Chaka, the Black Panther before him and a descendant of Bashenga. Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer &lt;a href=\"Klaw%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Ulysses Klaue&lt;/a&gt; finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T'Chaka, only to see his \"sound blaster\" turned on him by a grieving teenaged T'Challa. Klaue's right hand is destroyed, and he and his men flee.\nWakanda has an unusually high rate of mutation due to the dangerously &lt;a href=\"mutagen\"&gt;mutagen&lt;/a&gt;ic properties of the Vibranium Mound. A large number of these Wakandan Mutates are working for &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Killmonger\"&gt;Erik Killmonger&lt;/a&gt;.\nVibranium radiation has permeated much of Wakanda's &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Cult (although T'Challa once allowed a dying &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; to eat it in the hope that it would help him deal with ) and the flesh of the White Gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Cult.\nIn the 2008 \"&lt;a href=\"Secret%20Invasion\"&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/a&gt;\" storyline, &lt;a href=\"Skrull\"&gt;Skrull&lt;/a&gt; forces led by Commander K'vvvr invade Wakanda and engage Black Panther and his forces. Due to heavy resistance to the deployment of technological developments, both sides are forced to fight with swords and spears. The Wakandan forces voluntarily wear panther masks; this prevents the Skrulls from focusing attacks on their leader. Despite losses, the Wakandans defeat the Skrulls. They kill every single one, including K'vvvr, and send their ship back, packed with the bodies. A warning against invading Wakanda is left written on the wall of the ship's control center.\nWhile under the cosmic power of the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Force%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Phoenix Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namor\"&gt;Namor&lt;/a&gt; attacks Wakanda for hiding the Avengers and destroys much of the country with a tidal wave. After the attack, all mutants (particularly those who were siding with Phoenix controlled mutants) are banned from entering Wakanda as stated by Black Panther. Some students from the Jean Grey school are attacked by the Wakandan people; the students barely flee with the help of Storm.\nWhen Hydra manipulates a sentient cosmic cube named Kobik into unknowingly replaces the real Captain America's Steve Roger with his Hydra counterpart, then enact their &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Empire%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Secret Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Wakanda is under a threat to be taken over by the rise of terrorist group across the universe, with its king T'Challa got captured and being forced to surrender, until all heroes and some villains who rebels Hydra finally found a way to get both Kobik and the real Steve Rogers back, while rescuing both T'Challa and the rest of both captured and manipulated heroes. Once Hydra's empire has been undone, Wakanda expanded its legacy to form an &lt;a href=\"Galactic%20empire\"&gt;intergalactic empire&lt;/a&gt; on Planet Bast, while also revoke the mutant ban in their country, such as allowing Storm to visit and help anytime. The empire, now encompassing five galaxies, arose after a mission that sought the origin of Mena Ngai, the meteorite that brought the vibranium to Wakanda.\nWakandan Religion.\nWakanda contains a number of religious sects originating from various places in Africa, the Pantheon of Wakanda is known as \"The Orisha\", &lt;a href=\"orisha\"&gt;orisha&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20language\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt; word meaning spirit or deity, &lt;a href=\"Bast%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Bast&lt;/a&gt; the Panther Goddess, &lt;a href=\"Thoth\"&gt;Thoth&lt;/a&gt;, god of the moon and wisdom and &lt;a href=\"Ptah\"&gt;Ptah&lt;/a&gt;, the Shaper are &lt;a href=\"Heliopolitans\"&gt;Heliopolitan&lt;/a&gt; deities, who left &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"pharaohs\"&gt;pharaohs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kokou%20%28orisha%29\"&gt;Kokou&lt;/a&gt; is a warrior orisha from &lt;a href=\"Benin\"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mujaji\"&gt;Mujaji&lt;/a&gt; is a rain goddess of the &lt;a href=\"Lobedu%20people\"&gt;Lobedu people&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Other deities are worshiped in Wakanda, such as &lt;a href=\"Sekhmet\"&gt;Sekhmet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sobek\"&gt;Sobek&lt;/a&gt;, other Helipolitan deities and the gorilla gods Ghekre and Ngi, worshiped by the Jabari tribe.\nPanther cult.\n&lt;a href=\"Bast%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Bast&lt;/a&gt; the Panther Goddess, based on &lt;a href=\"Bastet\"&gt;Bast&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egyptian\"&gt;ancient Egyptian deity&lt;/a&gt;, is the primary deity of Wakanda. After the vibranium meteor fell, a number of Wakandans were painfully mutated into \"demon spirits\" and began attacking their fellow Wakandans.\nT'Challa's ancestor Bashenga begun to close the vibranium mound to outsiders. He formed a religious order that guarded the mound and fought to keep the \"demon spirits\" from spreading across the kingdom. As the ceremonial and religious role, he took the title of Black Panther as chief of the Panther Tribe. As part of the cult's ceremonies, a Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb. The herb enhances the physical attributes of the person who consumes it to near-superhuman levels, in a similar manner to the super-soldier serum.\nWhite Gorilla cult.\nThe tribe that would become the Jabari worshiped Ngi, who was responsible for creating &lt;a href=\"Gorilla-Man\"&gt;Gorilla-Man&lt;/a&gt;. Ngi was based on the &lt;a href=\"Beti-Pahuin%20peoples\"&gt;Yaounde&lt;/a&gt; deity of the same name. Currently, the Jabari tribe worship the gorilla god Ghekre, based on the &lt;a href=\"Baoul%C3%A9%20people\"&gt;Baoul\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; deity of the same name. Wakanda evolved from a hunter-warrior society, and was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. The dominant Black Panther Cult outlawed the rival White Gorilla Cult's worship in Wakanda. M'Baku (&lt;a href=\"Man-Ape\"&gt;Man-Ape&lt;/a&gt;) of the Jabari tribe is one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to T'Challa, the Black Panther himself. While T'Challa, king of Wakanda, is on a several month leave of absence from Wakanda, the ambitious M'Baku plots to usurp the throne. M'Baku flouts T'Challa's edicts and revives the White Gorilla Cult, killing one of the rare white gorillas living in the jungles near Wakanda. M'Baku bathes in the gorilla's blood and eats its flesh which \"mystically\" confers the gorilla's great strength upon M'Baku. He tries to defeat T'Challa in combat, hoping to take over the country, but is beaten and banished from Wakanda. According to the 2018 film, the White Gorilla cult, known in the film as the Jabari (or the Mountain Tribe), revere the monkey god &lt;a href=\"Hanuman\"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;.\nLion cult.\n&lt;a href=\"Sekhmet%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Sekhmet&lt;/a&gt; the Lion Goddess, based on the deity &lt;a href=\"Sekhmet\"&gt;of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, could possess the form of any human worshipers or the bodies of those sanctified and sacrificed by her worshipers, she transformed these subjects into human avatars of herself. She has a number of other powers, some of which she has demonstrated. Sekhmet could grow in size, move at rapid speeds, teleport herself and others, and alter her specific density. The Lion goddess possessed superhuman strength and durability, and she was immortal. She can manipulate the minds of the weak-willed.\nLittle is known of the history of the Lion Goddess. She had apparently lost many worshipers over the years to the Cult of the Panther God, despite the fact that Sekhmet physically manifested before its followers, and the Panther God only appears to its priests.\nCrocodile cult.\n&lt;a href=\"Seth%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29\"&gt;Sobek&lt;/a&gt; the Crocodile God, based on the deity &lt;a href=\"Sobek\"&gt;of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be an ancient and somewhat neglected Wakandan deity.\nName.\nThere are several theories for the name of Wakanda. The name may be inspired by a &lt;a href=\"Sioux\"&gt;Siouan&lt;/a&gt; god called Wakanda, Wakonda, or Waconda, or Wakandas, a fictional African tribe from &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs\"&gt;Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;' novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man-Eater\"&gt;The Man-Eater&lt;/a&gt;\", written in 1915 but published posthumously in 1957, or the Kenyan tribe &lt;a href=\"Kamba%20people\"&gt;Kamba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akamba\"&gt;Akamba&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wakamba\"&gt;Wakamba&lt;/a&gt;, or the word &lt;a href=\"Kanda%20%28lineage%29\"&gt;\"kanda\"&lt;/a&gt;, which means \"family\" in &lt;a href=\"Kikongo\"&gt;Kikongo&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguage.\nIn the comics, Wakanda has three official languages: Wakandan, &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20language\"&gt;Yoruba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hausa%20language\"&gt;Hausa&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters from Wakanda are portrayed speaking the South African &lt;a href=\"Xhosa%20language\"&gt;Xhosa language&lt;/a&gt;. The Jabari Tribe are portrayed speaking a dialect similar to &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20language\"&gt;Igbo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefenses.\nIn the comics, Wakanda is the foremost &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; power on Marvel Earth. The Wakandan Army is the country's main ground forces, while the Wakandan Navy oversees naval operations. The Wakandan Air Guard is the nation's &lt;a href=\"air%20force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;, which includes pilots wearing powerful suits of combat armor. In order to ensure peace and stability in Wakanda, the Black Panther picked &lt;a href=\"Dora%20Milaje\"&gt;Dora Milaje&lt;/a&gt; (\"adored ones\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. Wakanda has its own intelligence system known as the N'Charu Silema; a spy network that worked across the globe to maintain the nation's secrecy. It was considered as good as the &lt;a href=\"Mossad\"&gt;Mossad&lt;/a&gt; and certainly better than the &lt;a href=\"CIA\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MI6\"&gt;MI6&lt;/a&gt;. later, P.R.I.D.E. (Princess Regent Intelligence Division Executives) was developed as the nation's protection agency. Wakanda is one of the few &lt;a href=\"Earth-616\"&gt;Earth-616&lt;/a&gt; civilizations who have &lt;a href=\"contingency%20plan\"&gt;contingency plan&lt;/a&gt;s for dealing with &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Devourer of Worlds\".\nCultural impact.\nIn December 2019, it was discovered that the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;'s website listed Wakanda as a &lt;a href=\"Free%20trade\"&gt;free-trade&lt;/a&gt; partner, with a list of traded goods which included ducks, donkeys and dairy cows. The USDA claimed the fictional country had been added to the list \"by accident during a staff test\" and removed it soon after the public became aware of it.\nThe Wakandan capital city, Birnin Zana, could offer an alternative for what future cities could be like in Africa. There are already many smart city initiatives being worked out in Africa, with many &lt;a href=\"Ecocity\"&gt;ecocities&lt;/a&gt; emerging across the continent.\nSenegalese-American singer &lt;a href=\"Akon\"&gt;Akon&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to build \"&lt;a href=\"Akon%20City\"&gt;Akon City&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"solar%20power\"&gt;solar power&lt;/a&gt;ed \"real-life\" Wakanda on 2,000 acres of coastal land in Senegal inspired by Birnin Zana. He first shared his concept for a futuristic, technologically advanced city in 2018 and said it would welcome members of the African diaspora. The \"Washington Post\" reported that the project had secured $4 billion of the $6 billion investment necessary to build Akon City.\nTechnology writers have also compared Wakandan principles to those expressed in African technology research. Anti-colonial AI, for example, has been described as \"in keeping with Wakandan principles\" by developing technology for benevolent purposes. It also seeks \"to avoid algorithmic exploitation and algorithmic oppression\" in &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wakanda name has also been adopted in small businesses. One example is Wakanda Place, an African and multicultural bar in &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide, South Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Entertainment at the bar includes DJs who play music from Africa and the African diaspora.\nIn other media.\nFilm.\nMarvel Cinematic Universe.\nWakanda appears in media set in the &lt;a href=\"Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe\"&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt; (MCU). Inhabitants from this version of the country speak in the &lt;a href=\"Xhosa%20language\"&gt;Xhosa language&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"T%27Challa%20%28Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe%29\"&gt;T'Challa&lt;/a&gt;'s actor &lt;a href=\"Chadwick%20Boseman\"&gt;Chadwick Boseman&lt;/a&gt; developed using a \"regional accent based on where Wakanda would be. He did great research on the very cultural aspects of the character. Even though it's a fictional culture, [he figured] out ways to tether it into real African culture.\" Additionally, it is located at the northern end of Lake Turkana, at a fictional point bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Kenya. In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the &lt;a href=\"Ilemi%20Triangle\"&gt;Ilemi Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, claimed by each of these countries.\nWakanda consists of five tribes, four of which are united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther%20%28film%29\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;\" film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs.\nBelow is Wakanda's featured appearances:\nThe lords of each tribe sit on the king's council, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, &lt;a href=\"Erik%20%26quot%3BKillmonger%26quot%3B%20Stevens\"&gt;Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, M'Baku is also granted a seat on the council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes speak a version of the &lt;a href=\"Xhosa%20language\"&gt;Xhosa language&lt;/a&gt; while the Jabari speak an &lt;a href=\"Igbo%20language\"&gt;Igbo&lt;/a&gt; dialect. The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic throughout various historical events that affected Africa, such as the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;Atlantic slave trade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Colonialism\"&gt;colonization&lt;/a&gt; of Africa by European powers, &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead to outsiders trying to invade Wakanda. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Later in the film, Killmonger arrives to try and seize the throne - sharing T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons instead. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \"Wakanda Forever\" salutes after their victories. Director &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Coogler\"&gt;Ryan Coogler&lt;/a&gt; stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lesotho\"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Basotho%20blanket\"&gt;Basotho blanket&lt;/a&gt;s also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.\nBooks.\nLittle Golden Books.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Little%20Golden%20Books\"&gt;Little Golden Books&lt;/a&gt; were published."
