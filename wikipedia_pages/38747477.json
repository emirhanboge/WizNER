He then participated in the COSAFA U-20 Tournament the following year, winning the Championship.\nKatebe earned his first full cap for Zambia in a goalless draw against Angola in a friendly match on 16 May 2012 in Luanda. Katebe played the entire 90 minutes in defence, playing first as a center back and then moving into the defensive midfield position. Katebe subsequently has featured for the Zambian national team in matches against Malawi, South Korea and Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia.\nHe has been called up several times for the Zambian National Team and has featured in friendly matches, the 2015 COSAFA Cup (where he scored 2 goals), and several African Nations Cup qualifiers."
