The authors of the \"&lt;a href=\"Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides\"&gt;Buildings of England&lt;/a&gt;\" series describe it as \"a charming estate church\".\nHistory.\nSt Michael's was built in 1845\u201346, and designed by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Trubshaw\"&gt;Charles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Trubshaw\"&gt;James Trubshaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nExterior.\nThe church is constructed in &lt;a href=\"rubble\"&gt;rubble&lt;/a&gt; stone with &lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt; dressings, and has a tiled roof. Its plan consists of a four-&lt;a href=\"bay%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, a south porch, a two-bay &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"vestry\"&gt;vestry&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, and a west tower. The tower has angle &lt;a href=\"buttress\"&gt;buttress&lt;/a&gt;es and a plain &lt;a href=\"parapet\"&gt;parapet&lt;/a&gt;. In the angle between the tower and the nave on the north side is a stair &lt;a href=\"Turret%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;turret&lt;/a&gt; which rises above the height of the tower, and contains round-headed &lt;a href=\"casement%20window\"&gt;casement window&lt;/a&gt;s. On the west side of the tower is a doorway with a semicircular head in a loosely &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; style, which is decorated with spaced chevron motifs. Above the door is a two-light window in loosely &lt;a href=\"English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Early%20English%20Gothic\"&gt;Early English&lt;/a&gt; style, with a circular clock face above that. On each side of the top stage are three &lt;a href=\"lancet%20window\"&gt;lancet&lt;/a&gt; bell openings. The south porch has a loosely Romanesque doorway, above which is a &lt;a href=\"niche%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;niche&lt;/a&gt; containing a statue of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;Saint Michael&lt;/a&gt;. The windows along the sides of the church are in Early English style.\nInterior.\nInside the church, the nave has a &lt;a href=\"hammerbeam%20roof\"&gt;hammerbeam roof&lt;/a&gt;. Both the nave and the chancel are floored with &lt;a href=\"encaustic%20tile\"&gt;encaustic tile&lt;/a&gt;s. In the church are four brass corona &lt;a href=\"chandelier\"&gt;chandelier&lt;/a&gt;s.
