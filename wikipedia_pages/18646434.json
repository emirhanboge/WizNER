    "text": "USS \"Locust\" (YN-17/AN-22) was an built for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. She was later transferred to the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; as \"Locuste\" (A765).\nShe was sold to Malaysian owners but sank after striking a reef off Cikobia Island, &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, on 30 July 1978. She was towing the former French ship , which also sank.\nCareer.\nThe second ship to be so named by the Navy, \"Locust\" (YN-17) was laid down by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;American Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, 18 October 1940; launched 1 February 1941; and placed in service 13 July 1941 for passage down the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20River\"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt; for a year of net-laying duties in the &lt;a href=\"3d%20Naval%20District\"&gt;3d Naval District&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"New%20York%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York, New York&lt;/a&gt;, before commissioning December, 1942, LT R. Jordan, &lt;a href=\"USNR\"&gt;USNR&lt;/a&gt;, in command.\nAssigned to the &lt;a href=\"Service%20Squadron%2C%20Pacific%20Fleet\"&gt;Service Squadron, Pacific Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, the beginning of 1943, \"Locust\" laid and tended &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20net\"&gt;torpedo net&lt;/a&gt;s, moorings, and &lt;a href=\"buoy\"&gt;buoy&lt;/a&gt;s and participated in various towing and salvage operations in the South &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; through World War II.\nThe net tender was off San Cristobel Island, in the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Islands\"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;, in April 1943 with &lt;a href=\"Task%20Unit\"&gt;Task Unit&lt;/a&gt; 32.4.7 when she came under attack the 5th. For about 5 minutes \"Locust\", with \"YAG-26\" in tow, was not only dodging fire from a &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; bomber but also a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; from an undetected enemy &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuccessfully evading the assault, she continued her small but vital role in the ultimate naval victory, serving in the Solomon Islands, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"New%20Hebrides\"&gt;New Hebrides&lt;/a&gt; through her reclassification to \"AN-22\" on 20 January 1944.\nShe departed for the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20West%20Coast\"&gt;U.S. West Coast&lt;/a&gt; 6 August 1945, arriving &lt;a href=\"San%20Pedro%2C%20California\"&gt;San Pedro, California&lt;/a&gt;, the 18th. With the postwar disarmament policy in force \"Locust\" spent the next 6 months moving from one west coast berthing area to another until 8 July 1946 when she decommissioned at &lt;a href=\"Astoria%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Astoria, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, and entered the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Reserve%20Fleet\"&gt;Atlantic Reserve Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, where she remained until stricken from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;U.S. Naval Vessel Register&lt;/a&gt; 1 September 1962.\n\"Locust\" was later sold to and commissioned in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; as \"Locuste\" (A765). In later service, she struck a reef off Cikobia Island, &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, 30 July 1978 and sank."
